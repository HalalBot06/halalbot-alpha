For this\nreason Zakat is a true moral criterion, a standard of conduct\nthat paves a way to success in this life and in the Hereafter.\nThis is also why paying Zakat is an act that purifies\none\u2019s wealth. For in the first instance, Zakat is a divine\nprescription that cleanses the human heart of all manner of\ngreed and excessive material desire. These ungodly qualities\nit replaces with a love of God that manifests itself in an action\nthat asserts our higher human natures over our lower, animal\nimpulses. By paying Zakat we become obedient to God,\nsincere in our worship of Him, and grateful to Him for His\nblessing of life and guidance. So Zakat not only filters out\nimpurity from our wealth, it decontaminates us ourselves\nfrom sin, base character, and guilt. God says in the Quran:"}
