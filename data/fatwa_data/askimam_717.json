  "question": "Growing a beard is known to be Sunna (immitating the sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W)) Not Obligatory?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was surprised to read that growing a beard is obligatory. My father is growing a fist-length beard and I told him about your view. He told me it's Sunna. And Sunna is not obligatory, it's just that it is better and that you will be rewarded for it, but it is not obligatory.A lot of Muftis in the world, even in the Arab world, in which I live in, do not grow beards.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two types of Sunnats: Sunan-e-Hudaa and Sunan-e-Zawaaid.\n\nSunan Huda, for example, to perform the necessary Sunnats before and after\nSunnah Salaats. The beard falls in the same category as the prophet\nreprimanded people not keeping beards. Had it been just an extra Sunnat\n(Sunan-Zawaaid), he would not have reprimanded upon not keeping a beard.\nReprimanding is regarded as an expression of compulsion. The laws of Islam\nshould be scaled by the book (principles) and not practices of any\nindividual even though he may claim to be an authority in Shari'ah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
