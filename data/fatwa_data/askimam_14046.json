  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDo you have any contacts where we could purchace Alim books.  My friend is studying with a shaikh, and has found a hard time locating books, specifically for the last year of his sudies.  He likes the large indian-style kitaabs,  with the hashia on the sides of the page.  Do you have any such places in S. africa (or anywhere esle), where we can order the kitaabs.  The madressas in the US sometimes sell the books at a high cost, and also take a long time to order.\n\nIs medical insurance halal.  My company offers medical/dental/vision coverage free of charge.  Medical costs are very high in the US-  Is it halal to use this insurance.\n\nIs home or car insurance halal?  In the US it is illegal to have no car insurance -  I have the minimum insurance.\n\nIs 401K investment halal.  My company matches up to 2% of my salary (of what I contribute)\n\nDid you ever recieve an answer from guidance financial - Is their product still questionable.\n\nMy wife serious car accident a few years ago and she was severely injured.  She has a lawsuit pending in which she stands to make a substantial amount of money.  The money would be payed by the insurance company and not by the individual.  Is that money halaal.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Text books for the Aalim course are available at the bookstore of our institute.\n\n2. Conventional insurance schemes are not permissible. However, if your company offers you medical coverage free of charge, then you may make use of it.\n\n3. It is important for us to know the investment portfolio of the 401k plan.\n\n4. If the partnership agreement and the hiring contract in the diminishing partnership contract is completely separate from each other, then it will be permissible. If it is done jointly, where the hiring is a condition and a prerequisite for the partnership, then that will not be permissible as that will be regarded as two transactions in one which is prohibited in the Hadith.\n\n5. The insurance payout will be permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
