  "answer": "QUESTION\nA friend of mine says since Canada and U.S are non-muslim countries having intercourse with a non-muslim woman here is not zina for they can be construed as cariyahs.Is that true? He also says there is no hadith mentioning a zina occurrence between a muslim and non-muslim. secondly, is there any difference between committing zina with a muslim woman and non-muslim woman in terms of punishment\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour friend has committed a serious crime by commenting on a matter of Shari\n'ah without knowledge. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said,\n'Whosoever said anything about the Qur'aan without knowledge has erred.'\n(Muslim)\n\nAdultery is strictly prohibited in the Qur'aan. The prohibition is general.\nIt does not exclude committing adultery in a non-Muslim state or with a\nnon-Muslim. The punishment of adultery being hundred lashes and pelting for\na non-married and married person respectively can be applied only in an\nIslamic state under the authority of the Haakim (supreme ruler) or the\nQaadhi (judge)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
