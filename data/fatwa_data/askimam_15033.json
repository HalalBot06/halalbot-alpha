  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know if the contents on Wikipedia about all Islam in general can be considered correct. Are you aware of any scholars in Islam that participate and assist in validation of the content. The url i is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nWikkipedia is indeed an information portal, but the material from wikkipedia cannot be completely relied one since it is open to editing by anyone. Therefore no Guarantee can be given about the information being authentic or not. \n\nBesides that, after skimming through the main Islam article, following points were worth pointing out.\n\nThe majority of references for the main article on Islam are Christian Sources and Authors.\nIt also refers to Javed Ghamdi to whom Ulema have taken apprehension due to his views which are contradictory to main stream Ulema.\nIt shows the falsity of Shias as acceptable and thus makes Shias as a valid sect under Islam.\nIt also differentiates AhlSunnah from Sufism, whereas Sufism(Tazkiyatun Nafs) is the former.\n\nThus we recommend not taking Wikkipedia as an authentic source. There are many authentic Islamic websites available. We should rather use them. \n\nViews of Computer Dept.\n\nMadrassah"
