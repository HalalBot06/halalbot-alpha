  "answer": "QUESTION\nOne of my friend got engaged with one girl 6 months back (with parents will). The girl is Alema and she follows Ahle-Hadith mazhab.My friend is also Ahle-Hadith, but his family is still living like a ordinary muslim & they follow Hanafih fiqhah. After engagment, there had been no contact from my friends to-be-inlaw side. They called only once or twice with in 6 months and visited only once.Because of this my friends family is not happy and they are telling to break this and get marry with some other girl.Now my question is, whether my friend should follow his parents will, by telling no to the said girls father.But he is also afraid that, breaking their heart may cause anger of Allah. As that girl is very pious.Also he doesn't want to go against his parents will.
