  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is the procedure for a women to make up her fasts, left out in ramzan due to monthly period? What is the procedure if she did not make up for years? If someone enters the mosque and joins the Salath by saying takbeer (without Thana), without know which rakah it is. Latter in Salah he finds that he did not miss any rakat i.e. he joined the Salah in first Rakat. Then at what time in Salah he should say Thana?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. When keeping the Qadhaa fasts, it is not necessary to specify the date by saying, ?I am keeping a Qadhaa fast for so and so day?. Instead, oe should merely keep the fasts that have been missed. However, if one has missed a few fasts of many Ramadhaans and has to keep the Qadhaa for all the years, it will be necessary to specify the years for which he is keeping the Qadhaa for, i.e. he should make intention in the following way, ?I am keeping this Qadhaa fast for so and so year.? Niyyat for Qadhaa fast must be made before Subh-e-Saadiq.\n\n2. He does not have to read the Thanaa at all. His Salaat will still be valid.
