  "question": "What should we follow if we find an authentic hadith contradicting teaching of one of the four respected Imams?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. What should we follow if we find an authentic hadith contradicting teaching of one of the four respected Imams? 2. Is unintentional riyaa considered major or minor sin? 3. If parts of our (male) body to be hidden from others are displayed to males is it major or minor sin? 4. Please interpret the hadith that if we see wrongdoing we should fight it with our hands, if we cannot do it we should fight it with our tongue, and if we cannot do even this we should fight it with our heart. Does it mean we should fight it if we see such a case happening among Muslims only or also among disbelievers? And does it mean if we do not fight it even with our heart we are disbelievers?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It has been narrated from most of the four Imaams that each of them said, ?If one is able to make Ijtihaad and is aware of all the intricacies of Instinbaat, he knows a Naasikh (abrogating) Hadith from a Mansookh (abrogated) and he is aware of the proof of his Imaam for that particular Mas-alah, and together with the above, if he knows for sure that his Imaam was unaware of that authentic proof, then one is permitted to follow that authentic proof.? Besides the above case, one will not be permitted to do so. And the fulfillment of these conditions are highly impossible in today?s time because many in our time will leave out practicing on an authentic Hadith due to some hidden defect which effectively renders that Hadith unsuitable for Amal (practice) though it may be authentic. It should be remembered that not every authentic Hadith is practiced upon. It is the Fuqahaa who decide in the light of the strngest principles of jurisprudence which proof can be used for practice. Following a Sahih Hadith are Mansookh (abrogated). This that I have mention is an echo of the statements of great scholars of the past such as Imaam ibnus-sunni, Imaam Nawawiy, Imaam Taqi-u-ddin Subki, Allaamah Shaami, etc. (refer Aathaarul Hadeeth al-Shareef fee ikhtilaafil a-immatil fuqahaa of Shaykh Muhammad Awwaamah pgs.53-70)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Sayyiduna Abu Dharr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was asked, ?What if a person carries out a good deed and thereafter the people begin to praise him (and he becomes pleased with this, is this also not Riyaa?)? Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) replied, ?That is the cash glad tidings of a Mu?min.? (Sahih Muslim). So, if this is what is meant by unintentional Riyaa, then there is nothing wrong with it.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. One who opens his Satr in public is rendered a Faasiq and his testimony in court will be rejected. (Shaami vol.5 pg.385)%0D%0A%0D%0A4. The Hadith does not use the word fight, instead, it says that one should change it. And if one in his heart cannot condemn it, then it is as if he regards it as right. And anyone who regards a Halal as Haram is rendered out of the fold of Islam. That is why in one narration, the following words are mentioned, ?And beyond that, there isn?t the Imaan equal to even a mustard seed.?
