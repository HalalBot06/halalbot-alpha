  "answer": "QUESTION\nSometimes it happens that when we have to take obligatory Ghusul and we are sick. and if we take bath we fear that it may make make us more sick. but if mosque is near or reacheable by transport can we offer our prayer in mosque. what is the procedure for masah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible to read Salaat in the Musjid or even at any other place when one is not Taahir (paak). %0D%0A%0D%0AIf one is in need of Ghusl and his condition is such that he cannot use water because the using of water will cause him to get sick or cause his sickness to worsen, then he may cleanse himself by making Tayammum. Tayammum is a substitute for Tahaarat which is attained by water, thus, a person who perform Tayammum is said to be Taahir (paak). The method of Tayammum is a simple one. One will strike his hand on pure (paak) sand. Thereafter, lift the hands off the sand and dust the hands by hitting the side of the right hand against the side of the left hand. Then, wipe face with thehands. The parameter of the face will be the forehead to the chin and from one earlobe to the other. Thereafter, strike the hands on the ground and dust again. With this, we wipe the right hand from the tip of the fingers up to and including the elbows. Thereafter, the left hand must be wiped. It must be noted that intention for Tayammum is necessary.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
