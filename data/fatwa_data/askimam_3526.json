  "answer": "QUESTION\nI recently did a small monetary contribution of $3 at my job for a co-worker's baby shower. I am feeling really guilty because I basically paid the money for the baby shower but this person is having a baby out of wedlock. I feel that I should have not done that because I know that it is wrong to have a child out of wedlock. I did participate in it only by going at the baby shower for a few minutes and then left. I did not give any presents nor did I eat anything whatsoever. Also, is it appropriate to contribute money towards a co-worker's (non-muslim) funeral... our office does it to assist the family with funeral expenses. If this is something that I should refrain from, please advise me. Your kind assistance will be appreciated.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala says, 'And do not assist in sin.' (Maaidah)\n\nTo contribute towards a baby shower and in particular the baby being out of wedlock expresses complacency to an adulterous relationship which is assisting in sin. You should make Tawbah from that and abstain from contributing to avenues of sin in future.\n\nIt is not permissible to assist in non-Muslims funeral expenses.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
