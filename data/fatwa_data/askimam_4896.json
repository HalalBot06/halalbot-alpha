  "question": "I have uncontrollable urine flow so during prayer (Sajdah) I press my organ so no urine flows but people tell me my prayer is wrong because both hands should be on floor (1 hand on organ). this okay?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have a problem with my urine. After I go to the bathroom, urine still flows out of me for up to 2 hours later (during a sudden movement). I have two questions: 1) If some urine flows out of me while I pray, do I have to stop prayer, do ablution, then repray again? 2) In order to stop the urine flow (especially during prayer), I hold (press) gently my organ when I go down to Sajdah and during Sajdah. My parents and people in the mosque tell me that I do Sajdah incorrectly because both of my hands should be on the floor (I only have one hand on the floor since the other is pressing my organ to stop any flow of urine). Is it okay for me to press my organ to stop the flow during prayer? I don?t do it because I want to, but because I have to. Thank you for your help.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the details of your question, it appears that you are a Ma'zoor\n(excused person). If so, there is no ned for you to control the flow of the\nurine. Kindly refer attached - Rules Pertaining to the Ma'zur.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
