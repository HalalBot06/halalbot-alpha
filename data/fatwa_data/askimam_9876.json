  "question": "As we both know the history of shah waliullah, saluhuddin, nurruduin, etc. They reformed firmly and with eman. Now in the 21st century it is again ignorance with Muslims and kaafir",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nshaik abdul wahhab najd. rahmatullahalai. and many more. How these illustrious people changed Islam and kaafir history. They reformed firmly and with eman. Now in the 21st century it is again ignorance with Muslims and kaafir . There are 2 groups now, the tablighy people allhamdullilah and the al qaida group . One group has no violence and the other full of violence. The ummat is really suffering. Like Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran e.t.c. Thanks to America and other countries. No pathetic Muslim country has enough guts to go against them.. An if they do they are destroyed. I want to know is there any way to reform, should we wait for a leader like slahuddin ayubi (rah). I know what imam malik (rah) says but maybe that's for maybe for the next century, (Who knows exept ALLAH ).i was thinking if a good muslim person (shariat abiding) runs for leader in a a mulim country with citizens that are good or half good. make the country have a good economy good army good technology and put shariat. Make them grow there own food and only export from Muslim countries and not dependent on non Muslim countries like America. Then the country would have more population and good economy. Tabligh jammat is good but it would be better in a good shariat country. tabligh has been going for many years Muslims have become better but at the same time Muslims have lost land power and dignity. Tabligh and al qaida both wont work in the long run.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMay Allah Ta?ala increase your zeal and enthusiasm for Muslim empowerment. For that, two ingredients are important: a) Self reformation, and b) Political empowerment. Political empowerment can be achieved only through self reformation, personality and spiritual building. Consider the history of our dynamic Islam.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe period in Makkah Mukarramah was of spiritual and personality building. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) were instructed to wake up in the middle of the night and perform Tahajjud. They were instructed to bear and persevere the oppression and persecution of the enemies. They simply could not retaliate. Many years went by like that. Allah Ta?ala could have given His beloved Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) power immediately. When Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) came to Madina Munawwarah then Allah Ta?ala instructed him to establish a complete Islamic state with all its necessary structures.%0D%0A%0D%0AConsider the sequence that was nurtured by none other than Allah ? spiritual and personality development, then empowerment. This is the only way to obtain success and power even today. Allah Ta?ala states in the Qur?aan, ?Allah promises those people who bring Imaan and do righteous deeds that He will make then vicegerents on earth.?%0D%0A%0D%0AIf this order is not adopted, then no empowerment will be of any use. Consider the position of the countries under Muslim rule. How much Islam is there in them? The shortcoming is due to the lack of spiritual and personality building. Had that been there, they would never be subject to rules alien to Islam. Submission to Shari?ah and advancing its cause would be their agenda and priority in all conditions ? favourable and adverse. Every Muslim should realise this and endervour in every way and measure to empower the Ummah by reforming himself and whoever he%2Fshe can. It is the sensitivity to Deen that is the stepping stone for upliftment to Deen. Muslim rulers and people of position should fear Allah Ta?ala and also be sensitive to Deen. They should use their positin to advance the cause of the Ummah instead of protecting and preserving their private interests.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
