  "question": "I have not had ihtilaam even though I am 17.. Is there any shari implication of it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nmay aap say yeh poochna chahta hoon k sharah may ihtilam ki kia ahmiyat hai aur yeh kiun zaroori hai? meri umar 17 saal hai magar aaj tak mujeh ihtilam nahi hua. is ki kya wajah hai? aur sharah is baray may kia kehti hai,,Thanks in advance...\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nPeople vary in their physical aspects and not everyone is the same in regards to their level of development. It is not necessary for you to have a nocturnal emission at any specific age. The Sharī‘ah considers boys to have matured by the age of 15 if no others signs of maturity have appeared (e.g. nocturnal emissions, ejaculation of semen by other means etc.) You should not worry about the fact that you have not yet experienced a nocturnal emission, as it is something natural and beyond your control.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
