  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAlhamdollilah we take care of eating halal here. when we came here we heard abouhe chemicals mono and diglycerides.( these r the fat)it is a practice here that dont eat anything which consists of these chemical problem is that most of the things including roti bread cakes chips yoghurt cheese and any kind of snacks have these ingregients. we have litsened mufti taqi usmanis bayan in which he said ghost awwal haram ha aur doosri things awwal halal jab tak ke tehqiq na ho. confusion is this should we read the ingridients before eating as people has already informed us or dont read and eat. some people said that these chemical are processed so we can eat. please we will be highly apreciate u if study this matter and give us ur fatwa.jazak Allah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe ingredients mentioned, namely mono and diglycerides, can be of either animal or non-animal sources. If these ingredients are sourced from animals, then such ingredients will generally be impermissible to consume unless the animal was slaughtered according to Shari‘ī requisites. If the ingredients are sourced from vegetable or other non-animal sources then such ingredients will be permissible to consume. We would suggest that you read the ingredient list of any product before purchasing to ensure that there are no harām ingredients in the product. Merely being ignorant of the ingredients, whether unintentionally or willfully, will not render a harām ingredient halāl. At times, the ingredient list will mention if the mono and diglycerides are from vegetable sources etc. If its source were not mentioned, we would recommend calling the company and researching the source of the ingredient before consuming it. Abstaining from harām food is one of the utmost important facets in the life of a Muslim and there are great spiritual side effects that emanate from eating harām foods; therefore, great care and precaution should be taken to eat only halāl foods. It would be better if an ‘Ulamā board or organization could provide the service of researching the various companies to verify whether their ingredients are halāl or not. Until then, you will have to research the ingredients independently.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
