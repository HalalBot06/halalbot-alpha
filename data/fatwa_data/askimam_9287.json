At the outset, we wish to point out that a Muslim cannot sell anything Haraam in his business. That includes, wine and beer. The income of such sales will also be Haraam. It is also not permissible for a Muslim to work in such an outlet. However, if one is in a state of desperation, for example, he has to support himself and his dependants and has no source of income and working in such an outlet is the only immediate source of income, then he will be excused for working there and his income will be considered as Halaal. Such a person should also make Istighfaar (seek Allah?s forgiveness) and look for a Halaal alternative employment.\n\n2. If the person?s major source of income is from Haraam sources, then it is not permissible for you to join him to travel to Makkah and Madinah as his income is considered to be Haraam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
