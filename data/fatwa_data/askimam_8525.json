  "question": "1) I am prone to accidents and frequently have open wounds/ cuts on my hands. Can you please tell me as much as possible about the fiqh pertaining to wounds and wudu/salat.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThese are specific questions that I want to make sure are answered on top of the answer for question one.2) A related issue, after my wound heals and I take the band-aid off it leaves glue on the area, is my wudu valid if the glue remains on my finger. 3) When I remove all the glue I sometimes find out a couple of hours later that there was still glue there because it darkens from the dust/ material that sticks on it. Must I repeat all the prayers between the time I took off the bandage and the time I took off the glue that I missed. 4) In the situation where I get cut and the blood is pouring out of the wound during the time for Magrib, what should I do if I can?t get the bleeding to stop in time. 5) Wudu must be made with pure water and if a drop of impurity gets on it is no longer good for wudu. So if I have a cut on my thumb that is still juicy (not flowing) that I forgot about when making my wudu Is it correct to assume that my wudu is not valid since the water would have mixed with the blood from the wound on certain body parts , like the opposite arm, and rendered the wudu unfinished and my arm impure.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If there are cuts or wounds on the body of a person and by washing these cuts or wounds with water, harm will be caused then it will not be necessary to wash these parts of the body. It will be permissible in this case to simply pour water over these parts of the body. If this too will cause harm to the body then it will be permissible to only make Masaah (wiping a wet hand over the organ). If this too is not possible then it will be permissible to leave those cuts and wounds unwashed. If the organ is bandaged and it will be possible to remove it without causing harm, then it will be necessary to remove the bandage and wash the organ or else Masaah will suffice. (Fataawaa ?Aalamgeeriyyah, Vol. 1, Page 5) %0D%0A%0D%0A2. If the glue prevents water from reaching the skin underneath it, then Wudhu will not be valid. (Fataawaa ?Aalamgeeriyyah, Vol. 1, Page 5) %0D%0A%0D%0A3. As the Wudhu performed in the presence of this glue was invalid, any Salaat performed with this Wudhu will have to be repeated. (Fataawaa ?Aalamgeeriyyah, Vol. 1, Page 5) %0D%0A%0D%0A4. If wounds start bleeding when the Salaat time entered and the wounds do not stop bleeding, then he should wait until the last time of Salaat. If it does not cease bleeding then he should make Wudhu in this condition and perform his Salaat. If this condition persists during the full time of the next Salaat then he will be termed as a Ma?thoor (excused person). He will perform the Salaat in the manner explained above and will not have to repeat the Salaat. If this condition does not persist during the next Salaat time, then he will have to repeat the previous Salaat. %0D%0A%0D%0ANote: a.) For a person to be termed as Ma?thoor, it will be necessary that there must not be such an amount of time left in which he is able to perform Wudhu and perform his Salaat after the condition of ?Uthr (excuse) has terminated.%0D%0A%0D%0Ab.) For this state i.e. Ma?thoor to be removed, it will be necessary that this ?Uthr must not occur even once during the Salaat time.%0D%0Ac.) It will be necessary for the Ma?thoor to make a fresh Wudhu whenever a new Salaat time enters. He can perform Fardh, Waajib, Nafl Salaat, read Qur?an etc during that Salaat time only with that Wudhu. %0D%0A(Raddul Muhtaar, Vol. 1, Page 223, Ahsanul Fataawaa, Vol. 2, Page 74)%0D%0A%0D%0A5. If the blood has a quality of flowing and this blood mixed with the water, then this water will become impure. Those parts of the body or clothes will also become impure if this water touches it. If the blood does not have the quality of flowing then the water will not become impure and those parts of the body or clothes will remain pure if this water touches it.
