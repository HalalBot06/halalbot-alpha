  "question": "Does Allah concern with every person?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have doubt about Allah that he is not concern with me and sent me here only to suffer. 24 years have past,i'm still alone as I was in childhood. I'm born in muslims but not tought as a muslim no one guided me in all my life. I tried myself but i found useless to pray form Allah. i m a big sinner, I did all sins,now in last i have renounce islam,i have nothing to do with Allah,because if he can not here me,then he is not my god.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlmighty Allah Ta'ala is our Creator. We were non existent. He created us%0D%0Aand chose us to be the best and most Noble creation, human beings. He could%0D%0Ahave made us an animal, a pig, a dog, etc. or a tree in the jungle with no%0D%0Aexpectations of eternal enjoyment in paradise.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe should be thankful to Him for creating us and making us human beings.%0D%0AThere is no doubt in the existence of Allah. Ponder upon His creations, the%0D%0Askies, the mountains, the bright sunlight, rain, fruits, vegetables, etc. Do%0D%0Anot take those things for granted. Ponder upon them and search for the%0D%0Arecognition of Allah. You will certainly recognize Him if you are sincere.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe purpose of coming into this world is to express our slavery and%0D%0Asubordination to Him just as a slave does to His Master. Allah says, 'He%0D%0Awill test us in very many different ways, and only those that are patient%0D%0Aand endure the difficulties and submit to His Will will be successful.%0D%0AAlmighty Allah Ta'ala Knows best the condition of every creature. He knows%0D%0Ayour indept feelings.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah is Most Gracious and Most Merciful. He says in the Noble Qur'aan, 'Oh%0D%0AMy Slaves! Do not despair. Verily Allah will forgive all sins.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIn one Hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have%0D%0Asaid, 'If a person has sins equivalent to the foams of the sea and pebbles%0D%0Aon a desert, Allah's mercy is so encompassing that He will forgive every%0D%0Asin.' In another narration, it is mentioned that Allah will speak secretly%0D%0Ato one of His slaves on the day of Qiyaamat and remind him of all his sins.%0D%0AAfter the person will confess his sins, Allah will say to him, 'I concealed%0D%0Ayour faults in the world, today too, I will conceal your faults. Go in%0D%0AJannah, I have forgiven you.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above mentioned are few of many Ahaadith explaining the extent of%0D%0AAllah's Mercy. However, Allah says, 'Verily Allah will not forgive a person%0D%0Awho ascribe partners (commit Shirk) with Him.' The only sin that is%0D%0Aunforgivable is Kufr (disbelief) and Shirk (ascribing partners). Accepting%0D%0AIslam is the only atonement for the sin of Kufr and Shirk.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou should anticipate His mercy and come back to Islam. He will forgive all%0D%0Ayour sins and you should associate with pious people, Ulama, etc. and%0D%0Aconstantly request them for guidance. You should not draw your own%0D%0Aconclusions as that will be harmful to you.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
