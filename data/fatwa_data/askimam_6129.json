  "question": "Islam came 1400 years back, how can u follow it completely now?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nmy cousins and uncle constantly bring this up 'Islam came 1400 years back, how can u follow it completely now? how can u get up for Fajr etc', however i gave them daleels and tried to explain them (because i know Islam is for all times and all people), but can you give me comprehensive reasoning about this (logically) and daleels from Quran and Sunnah that Islam is meant for all people and all times and so are its injunctions (Like i read this Hadith in Bukhari saying 'All prophets came to a nation i came to whole mankind') daleels like that\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer http:%2F%2Fwww.alinaam.org.za%2Flibrary%2Fiotimes.htm%0D%0A%0D%0AISLAM FOR OUR TIMES - how and why%0D%0A%0D%0AIslam, exactly as it was revealed to Prophet Muhammad sallallaahu alayhi%0D%0Awasallam, and without any changes or alterations, is the religion that Allah%0D%0Achose for all people from the time he sent His Messenger till the end of%0D%0Atime.%0D%0A%0D%0AIslam is thus for recent times just as it was for earlier times. But while%0D%0Athe texts of this religion are immutable, people's conditions are not. What%0D%0Acan we do? In answering this question, people these days have been,%0D%0Abasically, divided into two main camps: the faithful and the revisionist.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE REVISIONIST SAYS: Keep the religious texts as they are but give them%0D%0Ameanings that suit contemporary culture just as those before you gave them%0D%0Ameanings that suited their particular cultures. The texts are divine%0D%0Arevelation, but their understanding is a human endeavor. Divine words are%0D%0Aabsolute, but their human understanding is relative.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE FAITHFUL ANSWERS: But the Qur'an was revealed in clear Arabic words%0D%0Awhose meanings are well known to Arabic speaking people, \"we send it down as%0D%0Aan Arabic Qur'an in order that you may understand.\" [12:2] The Prophet,%0D%0Asallallahu alayhi wasallam, explained the Qur'an verbally and by example.%0D%0AAll the Prophet's words and deeds are considered to be a living commentary%0D%0Aon the Qur'an. The companions of the Prophet were better placed to do so%0D%0Athan later generations because Arabic was their mother tongue, and because%0D%0Athey had knowledge of the occasions on which the verses were revealed, and%0D%0Athe situations in which the Prophet's words were uttered. Then came%0D%0Agenerations after generations of great leading scholars whose extant works%0D%0Aare a living witness to the fact that they understood the basic meanings of%0D%0Athe verses of the Qur'an in generally the same way as they were understood%0D%0Aby the first generations. Your claim that each generation gave the words of%0D%0Athe Qur'an and those of the Prophet meanings that suited their contemporary%0D%0Acultures is one that history belies.%0D%0A%0D%0AREVISIONIST: Are you saying that they never differed?%0D%0A%0D%0AFAITHFUL: They differed only slightly as far as the basic meanings of the%0D%0Averses and the Ahadith are concerned. But they naturally differed sometimes%0D%0Aon matters like what was to be deduced logically from the text or the way%0D%0Arules were to be applied to a new situation. What is important here, is that%0D%0Athe differences, whatever they were, did not come as a result of differences%0D%0Ain culture. They were individual differences that occurred even among%0D%0Acontemporaries living in the same cultural milieu. True, there were drastic%0D%0Adifferences, but they were among those who adhered to the correct method as%0D%0Awell as those who adopted irrational methods.%0D%0A%0D%0AREVISIONIST: Are you claiming that there is a scientific method for the%0D%0Ainterpretation of Islamic text?%0D%0A%0D%0AFAITHFUL: I am saying rather that there is a scientific method for the basic%0D%0Aunderstanding of every text, Islamic or otherwise.%0D%0A%0D%0AREVISIONIST: How?%0D%0A%0D%0AFAITHFUL: If you want to understand a poem by say, Shakespeare, what do you%0D%0Ado?%0D%0A%0D%0AREVISIONIST: I consult the books that explain what Shakespeare meant by it.%0D%0A%0D%0AFAITHFUL: Do you mean that you do not understand it in the light of your%0D%0Acontemporary culture?%0D%0A%0D%0AREVISIONIST: No, because my aim is to understand what Shakespeare meant by%0D%0Ahis poem.%0D%0A%0D%0AFAITHFUL: Do you mean that you give his words and phrases the meaning that%0D%0Ahe meant by them at the time that he wrote his poem, even if they differed%0D%0Afrom what current English usage might suggest?%0D%0A%0D%0AREVISIONIST: Of course; because my aim, as I said, is to understand what%0D%0AShakespeare actually meant. If I give his words meanings that he did not%0D%0Aintend by them, I would be attributing to him something that he did not say.%0D%0A%0D%0AFAITHFUL: Do you follow this same method if you want to be, say, an%0D%0AAristotle's expert? Do you try, for example, to learn ancient Greek in which%0D%0Ahe wrote his philosophy?%0D%0A%0D%0AREVISIONIST: I certainly would, and would try not to confuse it with Modern%0D%0AGreek, because my aim again is to understand what Aristotle said.%0D%0A%0D%0AFAITHFUL: Are there any ways, besides his language that you think would help%0D%0Ayou in understanding his philosophy?%0D%0A%0D%0AREVISIONIST: Yes, I would for example, try to see how his contemporaries%0D%0Aunderstood it because they were better placed to do so than I am. I would%0D%0Aalso consult the works of the experts who preceded me, and so on.%0D%0A%0D%0AFAITHFUL: Well, that is the method that we called scientific, and it is the%0D%0Amethod we advocate for understanding Islamic texts.%0D%0A%0D%0AREVISIONIST: But you are now ignoring the great differences between ordinary%0D%0Atexts and Islamic texts.%0D%0A%0D%0AFAITHFUL: Would you please elucidate those differences for me?%0D%0A%0D%0AREVISIONIST: One of them is that I can understand what humans like myself%0D%0Areally mean because I am human being, and because they address me in words%0D%0Athat are human; therefore limited. But God is absolute and what He means is%0D%0Aabsolute, and cannot therefore be couched in limited human words. But if%0D%0Aevery reader of Islamic text is given the right to interpret them the way%0D%0Athe reader understands them, there will be a multiplicity of meanings which%0D%0Aapproaches the absolute.%0D%0A%0D%0AFAITHFUL: Leaving aside your vague talk about the limited and the absolute,%0D%0Athe gist of what you are saying is that while human beings have the ability%0D%0Ato successfully communicate their meanings through a medium like Arabic, God%0D%0Afails to do so. This is despite the fact that He himself says that he used%0D%0Athis human language so that those who speak it may understand his message.%0D%0A%0D%0AREVISIONIST: This looks like a good argument. But related to the difference%0D%0Awe just mentioned is another important one. Islam, we say, is good for all%0D%0Atimes and places. If we give the words of its texts the same meanings that%0D%0Aan earlier generation like the Prophet's companions gave, we would be%0D%0Alimiting Islam to a particular age.%0D%0A%0D%0AFAITHFUL: So, what is the alternative?%0D%0A%0D%0AREVISIONIST: The alternative is what I propounded at the beginning Of our%0D%0Adialogue. Every generation of Muslims should give them the meanings that%0D%0Asuit their culture.%0D%0A%0D%0AFAITHFUL: Is this the understanding of the principle of the suitability of%0D%0AIslam for all times and places?%0D%0A%0D%0AREVISIONIST: It is, and I don't see how it can otherwise be.%0D%0A%0D%0AFAITHFUL: if the characteristic of the suitability of a message for all%0D%0Atimes and places is what you take it to be, then any message, even one that%0D%0Ais advocated by the most stupid human beings can fit it.%0D%0A%0D%0AREVISIONIST: I think you're exaggerating.%0D%0A%0D%0AFAITHFUL: I am not, suppose that some one called Mr. Donkey formulated what%0D%0Ahe thought was a comprehensive ideology that consisted of many doc%ADtrines on%0D%0Adifferent aspects of life. Suppose that, to make it suitable for all times%0D%0Aand places Mr. Donkey concluded his ideology with this statement; I hereby%0D%0Agive all believers in this world ideology the right to make any changes in%0D%0Ait they deem necessary to make it suit their different times and%0D%0Acircumstance.%0D%0A%0D%0AREVISIONIST: Change will start to be made in donkeyanism soon after it is%0D%0Aissued so much so that after a short lapse of time nothing remains of it%0D%0Aexcept that concluding statement. But the Donkeyans will continue to boast%0D%0Aof the suitability of their ideology to all times and places.%0D%0A%0D%0AFAITHFUL: Is this how you conceive Islam to be?%0D%0A%0D%0AREVISIONIST: Of course not. But then, what is your conception of this%0D%0Acharacteristic of the Islamic religion?%0D%0A%0D%0AFAITHFUL: I conceive it to mean that Islam, as it was revealed to Muhammad,%0D%0Aand without the slightest alterations, is good for all times and places.%0D%0AWhat makes this miracle possible is that Islam is not a manmade religion. It%0D%0Ais a message of guidance from the Creator of mankind who knows who they%0D%0Aessentially are, and who thus addresses them as human beings, and%0D%0Airrespective of their different cultures, colors, times, places, standards%0D%0Aof living and so on.%0D%0A%0D%0AREVISIONIST: What do you then mean by the phrase 'Islam for our times'?%0D%0A%0D%0AFAITHFUL: I am saying that though the religion does not change, people's%0D%0Acircumstances and problems do change. And so, to make the immutable religion%0D%0Arelevant to their special circumstances, we need to present it in a language%0D%0Athat our contemporaries understand, evaluate, in the light of it, any new%0D%0Aideas or ideologies that have a bearing on it, refute any claims that throw%0D%0Adoubt on it, find in it solutions for new intellectual problems.%0D%0A%0D%0AFinally it is important to make use of scientific discoveries to strengthen%0D%0Athe faith of its adherents, and to use them as means of invitation to Islam.%0D%0AAnd many other things, all of which are made possible because though the%0D%0Atexts are limited, what can be deduced and learnt from them is not.%0D%0A%0D%0ADr. Jafar Shaikh Idris"
