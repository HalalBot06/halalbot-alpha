  "answer": "QUESTION\n1- THe all encompassing duaa that Rasoolullah(SAW) taught his companions(Allahuma ini asauluka min ghayri ma salaku minhu Muhammadan(SAW) was aoodoobika min shari ma astaadaka minhu Nabiooka Muhammadan(SAW) wa anthal Mustaan wa alaikal balaagh la hawla wala quwatha illahbillahi). Does this mean that if u recite this duaa then u do not have to recite all the other duaas that he(SAW) mentioned as it is a all-encompassing duaa..?? 2- THere is a problem with the family as there is alot of jealousy and envy between bros and sisters. I read a quote from a Wali of Allah that we should thank Allah for removing others from our heart if this is the situation. Is this right or what should be done to solve the problem..it is causing us much displeasure.Merely sitting down witht the family is and discussing the problem is not enough as it works for a while and then the jealosy and envy starts again. 3-How does one perform Sujood e sahw??\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. This Du'aa will suffice but will not take the place of the hundreds of%0D%0Aother Du'aas taught to us by Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Other%0D%0ADu'aas should also be recited. However, where one is in a hurry or where one%0D%0Afeels that he probably missed out asking Allah for something, he may recite%0D%0Athis at the end of the Du'aa.%0D%0A2. Removing of others from the heart does not mean that jealousy should%0D%0Acreep in. it means that other people are out of mind and now the heart is%0D%0Acompletely focused upon Allah Alone. Envy is a natural feeling and cannot be%0D%0Aavoided. Yes, jealousy should be avoided at all costs. All of you should%0D%0Acontinue to strive and eradicate this malady without letting up.%0D%0A3. In the last Rakaat of Salaat, recite Tashahhud only and observe one%0D%0ASalaam to the right. Thereafter, perform Sajdah twice and then recite the%0D%0ATashahhud, Durood and Du'aa as you usually do, followed by Salaam.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Kadwa%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
