  "question": "kaffarah - i have a servant in my home (all time with her family) can i give her money each day.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have two questions regarding kaffara of the ramadan fast which is broken without any purpose. I read in BEHASTI ZEWAR that if aperson breaks a fast intentionally he has to keep fasts for 60 days non stop,and if is incapable of doing so he can give food to go poor and needy people(food for day and night which is enough to fill their hunger).It is written that you can give this food to one needy and poor person too(if you cannot give to 60 people).One can also give money instead for food which is enought to satiate their hunger for day and night.And you have to give the food and money everday for each day,notgive them simaltaneously for 2 months.(in oneday) My first question regarding to the above matter is: That i have a servant in my home (all time with her family) can i give her money each day.What if that if i give her money she doesnot eat food and buy other things instead or use money to buy clothes for her children.My question is that if she utilizes this money as she wants and not fills her stomach.Am i accountable for this or it is up to her how she uses the money. My second question is that my mother has some prize bond money which is not halal.(won from lottery).Can i give kaffara from the money to the poor and needy.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. It is permissible to give the servant the money. She could buy food with the money or anything else. You will not be responsible for that. However, if you are paying the servant wages, the money of kaffaarah should be separate.\n\n2. The money won from lottery should be disposed off to the poor and needy. It cannot be used to pay kaffaarah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
