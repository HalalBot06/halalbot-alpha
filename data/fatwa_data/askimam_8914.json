  "question": "Calculate zakaah, minors gifts and qasr salaah...I do not earn an income and heard that I have to sell some of the jewellery to pay the zakaah.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1.I have a few items of gold of which I do not know the value of. I really need to know how to calculate the zakaah on these itms as I am sure it?s value is greater than the nisaab.. I do not earn an income and heard that I have to sell some of the jewellery to pay the zakaah. 2. Gifts given to minors are not allowed to be given or used by any other person. What if the gift is something whch Islam does not permit such as clothes with pictures, are we the parent allowed to give it away? And what in the case if the child outgrows the clothes is a younger sibling allowed to make use of the clothes that were given as a gift? 3. If one misses a qasr salaah on a journey, does one need to make qadaa of qasr salaah or the full amount once youre not regarded as a traveller anymore. Jazaakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Zakaat is Waajib on that person who owns Nisaab or the value of Nisaab over and above his basic needs for a period of one year. The Nisaab for gold is 7.5 tolas or 87.479 grams. Hence, you should get your gold weighed and if it is equal to or more than the above amounts, then you need to give 2.5% in Zakaat. The gold itself or the value of it may be given as Zakaat. The value may be calculated by multiplying the total amount of gold per gram giving you a total. 2.5% of this total value has to be given in Zakaat.%0D%0A%0D%0AExample: You have 100 grams of gold (more than Nisaab, hence, Zakaatable). The price of gold is R100 per grame. Hence, the value of your gold is 100 gram x R1000 = R10 000. 2.5% of this should be given in Zakaat, i.e. R250%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Refer attached ?Gift to Children?.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. This will be determined by taking into consideration the last and ending time of that particular Salaat. If he was a Musaafir at the end of that Salaat, then when Qadhaa is made, Qasr Salaat will be read even though he may be discharging it while at home as a non-Musaafir. And if at the last time of a Salaat he was a non-Musaafir, then full Salaat will have to be discharged even though he may be discharging it while on Safar.
