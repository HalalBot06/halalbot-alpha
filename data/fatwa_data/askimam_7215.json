  "question": "I have been involved in an affair? I want to repent? What should I do? How can I correct my mistake?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was involved in an affair,and this caused the girls marriage to break,I have repented for the sin that I performed. What can I do to correct my mistake? Can I marry this girl to secure her financially? and correct my mistake? Please advice\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen one embarks on the road of Tawbah, one needs to make Tawbah Nasooha, i.e. that you would seek the forgiveness of Allah and make sure that you do not enter into such a sin again.\n\nWhat you have not made clear in your question is whether you are also married, because if you are also married then you could complicate and make difficult the life of another person including your family and hers. However if you are single, you are able to marry her. However it must be stated that Tawbah is only given by Allah and by marrying this girl, you maybe helping her both financially and emotionally but remember that you cannot compensate for the loss that the husband and both the families have been or are going through. Make sincere Tawbah, ensure that you become a regular to the Musjid, for Salaat keeps one away from all wrong and evil.\n\nMay Allah guide us all on the right path.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nShaykh Irshaad Amod / Moulana Imraan Vawda"
