  "question": "I dreamed that I was at a Imam's house with two people who needed advise. Please interpret.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI gave the two people advise (which they had come to the Imam for) & a Molanaar heard. He then told the Imam that my advise was sound and I'm surely guided by Allah (& it was what the Imam would have said). This happened +-30 before Fajr. There is more to the dream which I do remember but this is the main part.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream has positive signs. Continue doing good actions and pleasing Allah Ta?ala.\n\nWe suggest you do not pay too much attention to these dreams as at times, it becomes a means of a person becoming complacent. Continue fulfilling your obligations to Allah and maintain a strong family relationship.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
