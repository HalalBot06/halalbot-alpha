  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\n \n\nWhat do our Fuqaha mention about tomb stones and is it permissible for us as custodians of the graveyard to put a plate on each grave stating the name of the deceased, the date of his birth and demise?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIt has been narrated in a Hadeeth:\n\n“Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) has prohibited from hardening the grave, sitting upon it and from building upon it”\n\n(Sahih Muslim, vol.1, pg.312, Qadeemi)[1]\n\nIt is for this reason our illustrious Fuqaha have prohibited from hardening the grave or to build around it unless there is a dire need to do so.\n\nLeaving the grave simple is more beneficial to the deceased person and will be more deserving of drawing the Noor (light) and mercy of Allah Ta’ala. Furthermore, in leaving the graves simple, there will be a greater impact on those who visit the graveyard by reminding them of death and removing the love of the world from their hearts.\n\nIt is not a sign of love to the deceased to build around the grave or to beautify it. The Sahabah (Radiyallahu anhum) reached the pinnacle of love for Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) that the water he should use to make wudhu would not touch the ground. They used to collect it and pass it over their faces. Despite their extreme love for Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam), they left his blessed grave simple. We should also follow in their path.\n\nIf the sand gradually gets washed off from the grave, then from time to time it should be maintained by placing more sand on it, keeping the grave distinguished.\n\nIf by placing a small plate/board stating the name of the deceased, together with the date of birth and demise of the deceased will assist in preserving the allocation of the grave and other administrative issues as well, then it will be permissible to do so.\n\n(Noorul Idhaah, pg.131, Qadeemi)[2]\n (Addurul Mukhtaar, vol.2, pg.237, HM Saeed)[3]\n(Fatawa Rahimiyyah, vol.7, pg.66, Isha’at)\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā\n\n[1]  عن جابر قال نهى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يجصص القبر وأن يقعد عليه وأن يبنى عليه\n\n[2]  ويحرم البناء عليه للزينة ويكره للإحكام بعد الدفن ولا بأس بالكتابة عليه لئلا يذهب الأثر ولا يمتهن (فصل في حملها ودفنها)\n\n[3]  ( ولا يجصص ) للنهي عنه ( ولا يطين ، ولا يرفع عليه بناء . وقيل : لا بأس به ، وهو المختار ) كما في كراهة السراجية . وفي جنائزها : لا بأس بالكتابة إن احتيج إليها حتى لا يذهب الأثر ولا يمتهن"
