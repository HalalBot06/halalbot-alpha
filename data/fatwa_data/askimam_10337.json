  "question": "1. Is it permissible for a sunni man to marry an aga khani (ismaili) woman? 2. And if not, then in what conditions one could marry her?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am in love with a ismaili girl for a long time and she is also agreed to believe in sunni practices but not agreed to accept it as her madhab. She needs to continue her practices after the marriage, but she promises that our children will not know anything abt ismailisim.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the Agha Khani girl does not revert in belief and practise to the Ahlus\nsunnah Wal Jamaa, then it is not permissible to marry her.\n\nThe agreement, 'to believe in Sunni practices and not to accept it as her\nMadhab'. Furthermore, her need to continue Agha Khani practices does not\nconstitute complete belief which is a requirement for the validity of the\nNikah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
