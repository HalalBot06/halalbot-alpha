On the Day of Resurrection, he will be the light of my Ummah Another hadith ash-Sharif states: \"A man named Numan ibn Habit and called Abu Hanifa will appear and will revive Allah ta'ala's Religion and my Sunnah.\" And another one states: \"In every century, a number of my Ummah will attain to high grades. Abu Hanifa will be the highest of his time.\" These three Ahadith are written in the book Mawdua'at al-'Uloom and in Durr-al-mukhtaar. This hadith ash-Sharif is also well known: \"Among my Ummah, a man called Abu Hanifa will appear. There is a beauty spot between his two shoulder blades. Allahu ta'ala will revive His Religion through his hand.\" These two Ahadith are recorded in \"Durr al-Mukhtar.\"\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe first Hadith quoted is recorded in Durr Mukhtaar, however, this\nnarration is not authentic.
