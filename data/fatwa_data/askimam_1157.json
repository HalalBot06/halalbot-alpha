  "question": "Could you please tell me is the group Al murabitun which is based in Europe in line with Ahlus sunnah wal jamaah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Murabbitun some years ago attempted to propagate the ideologies of Abdul Qadir Al-Murabit. Their belief that Imaam Maalik who they call 'the man from Madinah' is the best and only example to follow from among the four Imaams. In fact, some members went to the extent to discredit Imaam Abu Hanifa, Imaam Shaafée and Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal (Rahmatullaahi Alayhim). In their attempt to implement strict 'Shariáh Law' like Hudood, etc. failed when certain members were imprisoned. The way adopted by the Murabbitun to a large extent is incorrect.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
