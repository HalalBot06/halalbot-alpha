  "question": "To marry a Christian woman, or to wait for a Muslim woman?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalamu alaikum I have been searching for a Muslim woman for marriage but unfortunately i have not found one that pleases me. In the process i have met a Christian woman who i do like. She doesnt believe that Jesus (pbuh) is the son of God and she doesnt drink alcohol and she is chaste. Should i wait and pray to Allah to help me find a Muslim wife or should i propose to the Christian woman?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer below marriage to 'Ahlul Kitaab'.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf you have the patience, we advise you exercise restraint and seek a Muslim%0D%0Awoman as compatibility in marriage is necessary to maintain a balanced%0D%0Amarriage life.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is not permissible for a Muslim female to marry a non-Muslim male.%0D%0AHowever, a Muslim male may marry only Christian or Jewish female. It is not%0D%0Apermissible for a Muslim male to marry any other non-Muslim female.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe reason it is permissible for the Muslim male to marry a non-Muslim%0D%0Afemale is that he would be able to easily convince the Christian or Jewish%0D%0Awife into accepting Islam. There is a possibility of the non-Muslim male%0D%0Aconvincing his Muslim wife into abandoning Islam. Therefore, Islam has%0D%0Aconsidered her feminine nature and protected her correct beliefs from being%0D%0Aa victim of abuse from the male dominance.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Muslim husband is not obliged to pressurise his Christian%2FJewish wife to%0D%0Aaccept Islam. He may apply wisdom and diplomacy and only influence her to%0D%0AIslam. In Islam, a female is equally respected as a male, however, due to%0D%0Athe different masculine and feminine natures, Islam believes in separation%0D%0Aof roles. It is obvious that there are many things a male can do, which is%0D%0Anot easily possible for a female and vice versa."
