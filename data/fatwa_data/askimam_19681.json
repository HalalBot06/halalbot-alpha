How did your father or grandfather toil and fare in helping their progeny reach the peaks of achievement?\n\n \n\nYour experiences will inspire others and will be a means of Sadaqah Jariyah (perpetual reward) for you.\n\n \n\nKindly email your experience or the experience of anyone you know of.  You may email us at: admin@daruliftaa.net\n\n \n\nIf you find it difficult to email, you may telephone the Darul Iftaa to relate your experiences on: 031-207-5772 or 072-786-4923.\n\n \n\nDo state if you wish to remain anonymous.\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
