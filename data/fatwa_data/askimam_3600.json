  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualikum, Last week were having gasht in our mosque a non-muslim German walked into mosque by himself and sat down with us to have few words with us. He was feeling very happy. But later on we were scolded by local Arab as why we allowed him to sit in the mosque. so my question is can we allow them to come inside in this situation.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible to bring or permit a non-Muslim into the Mosque. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to host non-Muslim delegations in Musjid-e-Nabawiy. That opportunity should be embraced to make Da'wah to non-Muslims.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
