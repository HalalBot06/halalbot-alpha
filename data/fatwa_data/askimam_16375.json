Every action that was practiced had to be based on concrete proofs derived from any of the Islamic sources. Thus, Imam Abu Hanifa used to discuss every ruling with at least forty Scholars who were each masters in different fields of Islamic knowledge. After much study, discussions and exchange of research on each law they used to finally reach a conclusion.......\n\n...... The Fatwa has been truncated for its length.
