  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAre Muslims allowed to listen to music? And are Muslims allowed to talk to females as friends?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nMusic and interaction with the opposite gender are two major fitnahs amongst the youth.  MāshāAllāh, it highly commendable and mature of you to inquire about the Islāmic stance on them with the intention of following your religion properly and gain closeness to Allāh Ta’ālā.\n\n \n\nIt is harām to listen to music according to the vast majority of the scholars of the past and present.  For a complete discussion of these issues, please see the following two links:\n\n1.       http://www.al-inaam.com/fataawa/music_detailed.htm\n\n2.       http://www.al-inaam.com/fataawa/music_objections.htm\n\n \n\nAs for talking to females as friends, Allāh Ta’ālā has mentioned in the Qur’ān,\n\n \n\nقُلْ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يَغُضُّوا مِنْ أَبْصَارِهِمْ وَيَحْفَظُوا فُرُوجَهُمْ ذَلِكَ أَزْكَى لَهُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا يَصْنَعُونَ (النور: 30)\n\nSay (O Prophet) to the believing men to lower their gaze and guard their chastity.  That is purer for them.  Verily, Allāh is All-Aware of what they do (Qur’ān 24:30)\n\n \n\nTherefore, to make female friends goes against the spirit of this verse.  Although casual interaction with females to whom one is not a mahram may start innocent, however, it leads to greater harāms as is evident in society.  Allāh Ta’ālā has commanded us,\n\n \n\nوَلَا تَقْرَبُوا الزِّنَا إِنَّهُ كَانَ فَاحِشَةً وَسَاءَ سَبِيلًا (الإسراء: 32)\n\nAnd do not (even) come close to fornication.  Verily, it is a shameful deed and an evil path (Qur’ān 17:32)\n\n \n\nNot only are we commanded to not commit fornication, but, rather, to stay away from all that which leads to it.   Hence, it is impermissible to talk to females as friends.  One should refrain from all unnecessary interactions with females to whom he is not a mahram.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
