But drops of urine fall after urinating. as said on ur site i began to use toilet paper.but the problem is i am going for umrah.so while in ehram i can not put toilet paper.so what do i do?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nPlease refer to fatwā #16245 below: http://askimam.org/fatwa/fatwa.php?askid=0854611113b797b001615b57ea873915\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl. Abrar Mirza,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa\n\n \n\n-----\n\n \n\nMany people are of the misconception that Ihram refers to the two pieces of cloth one puts on during Hajj and Umrah. In reality, it refers to the sacred state one is required to enter into, in order to fulfill the rituals of Hajj and Umrah. It is only a condition for the validity of Ihram that one puts on only such clothing that is not sewn to the shape of a human body. Wearing only two pieces of cloth is not a condition for the validity of Ihram. It will be permissible to wear only one piece of cloth or more than two pieces of cloth, as long as they are not sewn to the shape of the body and the awrah (the parts of the body that are compulsory to cover) is not exposed.  \n\n \n\n(Mu’alim al-Hujjaj Pg.105 – Nazim Kutub Khana)\n\n(Fatawa Raheemiyah Vol.8 Pg.74 – Darul Isha’at)\n\n \n\nIn the light of the above mentioned, it will be permissible for one to wear an adult disposable diaper, as it is not sewn to the shape of the body.\n\n \n\nThis is further supported by the ruling passed by Mufti Rasheed Ahmed Ludhyanwi, wherein he permits hernia patients to wear a langoot (a cloth generally worn by wrestlers between the legs to conceal nakedness) to avoid protrusion of intestines into the testicles.\n\n \n\n(Ahsan al-Fatawa Vol.4 Pg.531 – H.M. Sa'eed Company)\n\n \n\nBeing in the state of purity is not a condition for the validity of Ihram. Therefore, it will be permissible for your father to travel in the state of impurity, as long as he purifies himself before engaging in any act of worship or entering the Haram.\n\n \n\n(Aapke Masail aur Unka Hal Vol.4 Pg.106 – Maktaba Ludhyanwi)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMufti Abu Yahya,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
