  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n Is it permissible to eat chicken which has been hand slaughter and then dipped into 60 to 65 degree celsius of hot water without cleaning the impurities to remove the feathers. If not what should be the maximum temperature of the hot water in which chicken can be dipped that is permissible.Also would like to know everytime the chickens dipped, the water used has to be new or the same water can be used again and again\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIn principle, the impurities in the chicken should not penetrate in the meat of the chicken. That depends on the temperature of the water in which the chicken is dipped in. According to our investigation 60º-65º Celsius hot water is too hot and the impurities in the chicken could penetrate into the flesh of the chicken. The chicken can be dipped in the same water repeatedly.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
