  "question": "I am happily married to a pious wife. My weakness is that I am strongly attracted to beautiful women (eg public, media). On seeing an attractive women I feel depressed and ungrateful. What do I do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAttraction to women is a natural instinct in every male. However, we are\ncommanded in the Qur'aan and the Hadith to suppress the desires and protect\nour gazes.\n\nYou should control your gaze. Avoid reading material that have such\npictures. Avoid the television at all costs. Also, avoid going to places\nwhere you are attracted to look at them. When you control your gaze and turn\naway, you will feel depressed or sad but for a few moments only. On the\nother hand, if you allow your eyes to roam to your heart's content, your\ndepression will be longer. The more you control your gaze, the more you will\nappreciate your own wife and her beauty. Get joy out of what is Halaal for\nyou.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
