  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question is with regards to the adorning of red garments by muslim males\n\nI have been thought that wearing the colour red is haraam but some people are of the opinion that muslim males are allowed to wear red garments ONLY if it is broken with another colour for example a red skipper with white lines or a red skipper with a blue pattern.\nPlease clarify this..\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1. It is permissible for a man to have conjugal relations with his wife once her menstrual period has terminated before ten days as per her monthly habit and a complete salah time elapses after her bleeding stops, even though she did not take a bath. However it is preferable that she take a bath.\n\n(Nurul Idaah Pg.51 Kutub Khaanah Imdaadiyah Deoband)\n\n2. If a woman bled for ten days and ten nights, then the moment she stops bleeding sexual intercourse with her will be permissible irrespective of her taking a bath or not.\n\n[Bahishti Zewar Pg.92]\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
