  "question": "7281-Most of the Muslim countries are so poor; it does not have the proper educational infrastructure for higher studies, some of us have to take the risk for greater cause.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nReferring to question no.7281, I encounter one question myself; if we only study Deeni matters, (I am not saying we are not going to study Deen). We will not have Muslim Doctors, Engineers, Scientists, researchers, biologists, teachers in respective and different other background. Muslims will remain enslaved in different ways. It would allow Kaa'fir, Mushrikeens to rule over us and that would have more serious effect on overall all Muslims deen. For example: Most of the countries of this world with higher Muslim population are very poor, backward country with uneducated people, and the governmental institution depends on few western countries to resolve matters, instead of depending on ALLAH and direction given in Qur?an. Note: Most of the Muslim countries are so poor; it does not have the proper educational infrastructure for higher studies, some of us have to take the risk for greater cause. So is that answer still stands, please comment on it.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Islam does not prohibit the pursuit of secular studies. You are allowed to pursue a tertiary education provided your Deen is not compromised.\n\n2. Your question was based on it being an Ibaadat and the answer was provided accordingly.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
