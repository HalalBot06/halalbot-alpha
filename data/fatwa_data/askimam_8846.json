  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. i was cleaning my penis(not by stroking it)well i was shaving the hair off and clean it(not by hand,water and tissue wrapped around hand) is this wrong? 2. when i was 12/13 i had these white bits on my penis and it smelled so i had to clean it by hand etc....is this also wrong? ifso shall i repent? 3. are any of the 2 are masturbations?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, we wish to point out that the hair on the penis does not have\nto be removed. Only the pubic hair which is just above the private parts\nbelow the navel has to be removed. One may wash the private parts directly\nwith the hands. There is no need to wrap tissue around the hand.\n\nSince you are in your youth, and you are sensitive to the point that\ntouching the private parts may lead to erection, etc. you should minimise\nthat as much as you can. In any case, the two enquired situations are not\nmasturbations.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
