  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni was sitting here with my wife and our good friend and we were discussing ramadan.  what we would like to know is what is the punishment for intentionally breaking the fast during ramadan?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nFasting in the month of Ramadān is Fardh (compulsory) on every Muslim who is neither a lunatic nor immature (a minor). The person who does not fast in the month of Ramadān without any valid excuse is a major sin.\n\nIf a person intentionally breaks the fast of Ramadān, he will have to make qadhā and give kaffārah.\n\nKaffārah is, he will have to fast for two months (60 days) consecutively or if he is unable to fast then he will have to feed sixty poor twice a day with full meal. For details see the chapter of kaffārah in Bahishti Zewar on the following link: http://www.islamicbullentin.com/sercices/all_ebooks_p3.aspx\n\n(Bahishti Zewar, Vol.2, Pg.276 & Pg.288, Zam Zam)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl. Abduz Zaman,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nConcured by: Ml. Abdur Rahman Shareef, Student Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nUnder the guidance of:\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai Saheb\nDārul Iftā"
