  "question": "Is there a duaa so that someone accepts a marriage proposal",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy family have asked the hand of marriage for a girl that I know,but her father has refused three times even though he knows that I read namaz and quran, people have spoken to him so many times but he has to much pride and refuses for no reason, is there a special duaa that I can read so that he changes his mind .\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the girl is destined for you. Allah Ta'ala will grant her to you. If she\nis not destined for you, you will never get her.\n\nMany people have spoken to the girl's father, your family proposed for her\nmany times and the proposal was rejected. It is our humble advise that you\nmaintain your dignity and accept the refusal. It is possible your obsession\nfor the girl may lead to the loss of self respect and you may not even get\nthe girl.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
