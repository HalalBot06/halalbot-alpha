  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen I was about 12-13 years, or even younger, I heards from my elder cousin that when you fast, you can break it before 10:00am if you feel you can't do it. Because of this sometimes when I had made nafl fast and I felt I would be able to do it due to feeling weak or feeling that it will be too difficult for me later on during the day, I broke it before 10:00am. Few years ago during ramzaan I was fasting and in the last days of ramzaan, I got cough, heavy cold and was feeling like having flu. I broke the fast before 10:00am. Now after reading about islam and using my brains (not relying on what I heard) I feel that I have committed a sin in breaking the fast. Though I am making up for all my lost fast due to sickness, menstruation etc. I was wondering do I have to keep 60 days fast for these fasts? I once swallowed water out of fear during my nafl fast. Actually I was fasting and I went to toilet, since in western country they don't use water in the toilet, so I took a coffee cup, when I was filled the cup with water and was going to the toilet someone came and I drank the water, I was worried about what the person would think. So, what should I do for this fast?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFast is only obligatory on you from the age of puberty. If you had commenced\nany Nafl fast, after attaining puberty, and thereafter broke it, then you\nwill have to make Qadhaa for that day only. This does not differ whether you\nbroke it before 10:00 am or after 10:00 am. There is no Kaffaarah for fasts\nother than Ramadhaan. (Aalamgiri part1 pg.215).\n\nHowever, with regards to fasts of Ramadhaan, if you broke it intentionally\nwithout any valid excuse, then together with Qadhaa, you will have to keep\nKaffaarah fast for 60 days consecutively.\n\nIf the future, you should consult a reliable and competent Mufti in these\nmatters. Relying on what your cousin says will not be sufficient.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
