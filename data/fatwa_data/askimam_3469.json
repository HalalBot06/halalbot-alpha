  "question": "Jumaah salaat before time for Zuhr starts",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe Muslim poulation in our town is increasing rapidly. The current masjid is very small. So, the management conducts 3 Jumaah salaats (12.15pm, 1.15pm, 2.15pm). The 12.15pm (Khutbaah followed by salaat) finishes before 1 pm. The time for Zohr salaat in our town starts only at 1.21 pm and Zawaal time is 1.15 pm. Is the 12.15 pm & 1.15 pm Jumaah salaat valid?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe commencing time for Jummu'ah Salaat is the same as Dhuhr Salaat, that is\nafter Zawaal. It is incorrect to perform Jummu'ah Salaat before Zawaal at\n1:21 pm.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
