  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI found Islam while on combat duty in Iraq.  I spoke with many born Muslims and was told because of my desire to learn about Islam and the hardships of converting, I was more Muslim than the average Muslim.  I am still active duty army.  I will probably return to Iraq for combat.  I have 3 illegitimate children, and I am divorcing the mother of two too marry the mother of one. Can I still become a muslim?  Could I ever be an Imam?   Thanks for your time.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nMay Allah keep you steadfast on Islam, Aameen.\n\nYou should continue educating yourself on Islam. It is through education you will understand the beauty of Islam and dispel the propaganda against Islam. You could also enroll yourself for formal Islamic education and become a scholar of Islam.\n\nThe profound effect of knowledge and education can never be equated to wars. Knowledge and education empowers people whilst wars are damaging and destructive. The spirit of Islamic education is to lead mankind to Allah and the spirit of war is merely to dominate and obtain the wealth and resources of the other. Allah is our Creator and He is Eternal. The riches and glamours of this would are temporary. You should be part of the system of Allah and link people to Allah. That will be an eternal investment for you. You will also be respected in this world and the hereafter.\n\nWhat respect is there for the leaders of this world? When they are in position, they are respected. When they are out of position, nobody cares. That is not respect for an individual. It is superficial respect and respect merely for a position. An Imam bears the Divine knowledge of Allah and is respected as a person. That is real respect and dignity. You should therefore strongly consider becoming a scholar of Deen and be an ambassador of Allah on Earth leading people to good and righteousness.\n\nIn principle, a Muslim male may marry a Muslim female or a Christian or Jewish female. If the mother of your child is a Christian or Jewish woman, you may marry her and still be a Muslim. If she is not a Christian or Jew, you cannot marry her according to Islamic law. However, that does not mean you cannot be a Muslim.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
