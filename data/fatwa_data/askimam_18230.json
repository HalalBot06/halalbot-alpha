  "question": "Medical student needs a loan from the bank",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI hope this short note finds you and your loved ones in good health and Islamic spirit. Sheikh, I would like to know the answer from you and below is the question.\n \nA medical student requires about 250,000 dollars to study in medical school to become a doctor. I do not have any other source other than taking loan from any Bank. Question may rise do I have to become a doctor? No, I do not have to but if that is the answer for all muslim students then muslim can not be a doctor anymore. A muslim doctor who is Islamic person can easily impress non muslims to Islam with his great service and dual knowledge.\nI would like to know your best Judgment on this matter. May Allah (SWT) save us from all  misguidances that lead to Hell Fire.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh.\n\n \n\nWe concur with your judgement and believe that Muslims should also excel as doctors etc and be role models to non-Muslims with their sound Islāmic values and ethics. This also constitutes service to Islām and the Muslims.\n\n \n\nWe understand that your enquiry concerns the permissibility of student loans. This is an issue that concerns virtually every student intending to further studies at college or university and the Dārul Iftā has answered many queries of this nature. The advice that we generally offer to students faced with this difficulty is to seek the following student loan scheme:\n\n \n\nSome institutes like educational departments, finance students with loans that accrue interest only six to seven months after graduation. No interest is charged from the time of graduation up to six to seven months. If repayment of the loan is made within six to seven months after graduation, one is exempted from the interest charges and if repayment is made after six to seven months, interest would be charged therefrom. It will be permissible to obtain such loans as long as repayment is made within those six or seven months and the interest charges are avoided. We are aware of many Muslim students that opt for this type of student loan. They take up part time jobs during the course of their studies and work hard after graduation in paying off the loan within six to seven months after graduation, avoiding the interest. We advise that you seek such a loan and hope that this option assists you.  \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
