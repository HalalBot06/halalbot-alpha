  "question": "Is it permissible for a women in her period to recite the Holy Qur'an?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it allowed for a woman to recite the Qur'an when she's having her period? In Tirmizi, it says that she ought not to. While on the other hand, a hadith states that if one does not recite the Holy Qur'an, it would argue with them on the Day of Resurrection. Some sisters told me to wear a hand-glove when reciting while some other sisters told me not to recite the Qur'an. Should I recite the Qur'an or should I not? Which of the hadith is weaker on this regard? Am I comitting a sin if I do, etc? Please benefit us with your knowledge. Wasalaam!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for a female to recite the Quran during her monthly\nmenses and during nifaas (bleeding after birth). She should recite the Quran\nafter the completion of her monthly cycle in order to achieve the blessing\nof the Quran arguing for her on the Day of Judgement.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti E Desai\nFatwa Dept."
