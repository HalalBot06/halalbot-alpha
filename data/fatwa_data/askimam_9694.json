  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamoalaikum mufti sahab! what should a hanafi do when he is praying and another person belonging to the same or different madhab comes in, touches his right shoulder and becomes a muqtadi? 1. should he start reciting loudly if its fajar, maghrib or isha? 2. should he say Allahuakber loudly when changing positions? May Allah reward you for your work. 3. For qazah prayers i want to pray qazah of fajar after fajar, zohr after zohr accordingly for my 4 years of qazah prayers. Kindly inform whether it is ok as after fajar sajda is not allowed before ishrak time. what about asar?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Yes.\n\n2. Yes.\n\n3. Qadhaa Salaat is permissible after Fajr until before sunrise and after Asr Salaat until before the sun loses its glow. It should be borne in mind as missing Salaat is a sin, these Qadhaa Salaats should not be done in public at these times as it will fall under publicising your sin. People will realise that the only Salaat you could be performing in these times is Qadhaa Salaat. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyah vol.16 pg.382)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
