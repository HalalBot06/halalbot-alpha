  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy question: Why are the Jews hated so much throughout the world? Can you link me a brief history of the Jews?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah Ta’ala has cursed the jews for their repeated disobedience of Allah Ta’ala, and has cursed their offspring for their approval of the sins of their forefathers. This is why they are hated.\n\nUnfortunately, we do not have a detail article on the history of the jews on hand, and time does not allow us to compile a detail article.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala knows best.\n\nWas Salaam\n\nE. Vawda\nfor Daarul Iftaa"
