  "question": "Why is chain Haram for men?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nChain is for men and necklace is for women, so why should a silver or any other types of chain be Haram? Please give evidence from Quran and Sunnah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, it is not permissible for a male to adorn himself like a female. Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] cursed a male who imitates a female and he cursed a females who imitates a male. (Bukhari).\n\nThe prohibition is general. It includes imitating in everything ? conduct and dress. A female adorns herself by wearing a chain. It is, therefore, not permissible for a male to adorn himself like a female and wear a chain. A male cannot use gold. That is for a female only. (Bukhari)\n\nA male may use a silver ring equivalent to only 4.86 grams.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
