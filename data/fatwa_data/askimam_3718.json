  "question": "What Shall I tell a prospective husband about my past - what does Islam permit and forbid?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu Alaikum Sister/Brother Please can you advice me on the following. Recently, I have been corresponding with a brother on the Internet, with view with marriage.I need to know, if Islamic Shariah requires the women to disclose personal information to such a person before the Nikah. I have been married before and he has asked whether it was consumated or not. I feel quite uncomfortable in answering him, since I am not married to him (although I want to be honest). I have said, I do not have children and the marriage has been Islamically divorced via an Islamic Institute. And I will only tell my second husband, after marriage. Does he have the right to know, under Islam, even before proposing to me or seeing me? This is how he approached the question \"The Prophet (saw) espoused, men marrying for the first time to seek a bride who'd be a virgin. Please comment on it.\"Is this quotation correct? Can a never married (virgin) man marry a divorced women - what does Islam say about this?(I am Hanafi Madhab) Thank you Wasalam Confused Sister in Need 8.9.01\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for a male intending marriage the first time to marry a Baakira (virgin) or a Sayyiba (non-virgin).\n\nIf the prospective husband seeks a Baakira, and you are not one, then you should disclose that to him. To conceal that may be misleading to him. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Whosoever deceives us is not from among us.'\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
