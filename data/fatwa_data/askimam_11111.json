  "answer": "QUESTION\ni met a girl in a trip far away from home..we were livign together and she became good friend of mine. i accepted her as my wife and one night i had sex with her without any nikah... we were both agreed on what we did ...what does islam says about this..? if its a sin.. whats the Kafara of this...?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe girl is a Ghayr Mahram (not prohibited in marriage) to you. Shari?ah has emphasised on maintaining Hijaab with a Ghayr Mahram. It is prohibited for you to have any contact whatsoever with her. Any contact with the girl is a sin.\n\nThe concept of a ?girl friend? has no basis in Shari?ah. You cannot just assume be married to the girl without performing a Nikah. You have committed Zina (adultery) with her which is a major sin and incurs the wrath and anger of Allah. You should regret what you did and immediately terminate all contact with the girl. You should also make sincere Tawbah to Allah. If possible, give Sadaqah as much as you can and make a firm intention never to befriend a girl in future. If you cannot control your desires, then get married and perform a Shar?ee Nikah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
