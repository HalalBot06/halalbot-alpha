  "answer": "QUESTION\nI'm working in abroad and my wife stay with my parents in my mother country. I grant my wife to visit every month for some number of days to her parants house to stay. But my parants feel if she go there she does not respect them and if she come back she is respect them. And they do not want to let her visit to her parant house for the period that I agreed. Is it permissible for them to control her? If my parants ask me to decrease the no. of days, Can I take my own decision or I've to obey my parents?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShe is doing you a great favour by living with her parents-in-law. She has\nno obligation to live with them. They have no right to restrict her if you\nhave allowed her to visit her parents.\n\nWe suggest you appreciate her sacrifice of living with them and abstain from\nrestricting her or decreasing her stay at her parent's home.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
