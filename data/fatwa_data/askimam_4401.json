  "answer": "QUESTION\nI saw that I am with Rasulullah (SAW) and few other peoples who were Talibans. One person was digging a trench and rests of us were watching. The person was removing the mud from the trench and keeping it on the sides. Then I volunteered to dig it. I took the shovel and started digging it. I was also removing the mud and keeping it on sides. But some how I hit on the side and all the mud, which was removed and kept on the side, fell into the trench. I was embarrassed and I started removing the mud quickly again. Then I heard that the trench that we are digging is suppose to pass from the front of one house and the owners of the house are not allowing to dig the trench in front of their house. Rasulullah (SAW) is trying to convince the family to let us dig the trench. I went to see this incidence. I saw the person who was talking and trying to convince the family is Osama Bin Laden. Then I got the impression that either the person whom I was thinking he is Rasulullah (SAW) is actually Osama or Osama is also working with us and Rasulullah (SAW) is left for some other place. I saw that Osama is telling the family that if you are not allowing the trench to pass from the front of your house then give back our marble slab which is ours and which is buried in your house. I saw that everybody is saying that to remove the marble slab, the family will have to dig the ground. Which ultimately will make a trench in front of their house. My wife then woke me up for Sahur.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMake dua that Allah assists the Mujahideen and grant them success. (Aameen)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
