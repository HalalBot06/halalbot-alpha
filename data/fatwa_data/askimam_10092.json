  "answer": "QUESTION\nI understand that it is permissible to take medication w/ alchohol when none other is available... but is it permissible to take medications that make one drowsy. Also can one major (in school) in pharmacy or any field which requires one to make such types of (alchoholic, drowsy) medicines? Daleel please if applicable\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) It is obvious that medication containing alcohol will make one drowsy. It is precisely for that reason that it is permissible only if an adequate alternative is not available based on the rule-necessity relaxes prohibition.\n\n2) It is permissible to undertake a study in pharmacy which requires one to make medication containing alcohol.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
