  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)i was unaware that i should bath after ihtitilaam.my parents did not told me of it.i spent a whole ramzan under this condition.is my fast valid.as i did ghusl every mon&friday.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf one has Ihtilaam (wet dream), that invalidates oneâ€™s state of Tahaarah (purity). Ghusl will become compulsory. That is to wash the entire body, rinse the mouth and the nose. The state of Tahaarah is not a prerequisite for the validity of fasting.\n\nIf one is impure, then too the fast will be valid. However, the state of Tahaarah is necessary for Salaat. If you did not bath after Ihtilaam, the Salaats you have performed in that state are invalid. You will have to repeat those Salaats.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
