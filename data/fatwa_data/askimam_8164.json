  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have read your fatwa with interest but i would like to find out if it is true that the prophet (SAW) wore a silver ring with a black stone on his small finger on his right hand.Also i do not wear any gold but i do have a platinum ring. Is it permisible to wear it?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn a narration recorded by Imaam Muslim (RA) in his Sahih. Sayyiduna Anas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that the stone on the ring of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was from Abyssinia. (Sahih Muslim Hadith5453)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Ulama have given different explanations to this. Some say, the colour was Abyssinian (black), others say that perhaps the one who designed it was Abyssinian. (Refer Sharh al-Nawawiy and Fathul Baari vol.10 pg.396)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn a narration of Sahih Bukhari (Hadith5870), Sayyiduna Anas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that the ring and its stone was silver. This would mean that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) had more than one ring. (refer Fathul Bari vol.10 pg.395-396). There are some authentic narrations that state that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) wore the ring on the small finger of his right hand whilst others explicitly mention that he used to wear it in the right hand at first and thereafter moved it to the left hand.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
