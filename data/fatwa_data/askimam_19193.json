  "question": "Is Istikhara Allahs decision or a dream?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nsalaam, mufti saab i have a question regarding istikhara...is istikara allah(swt) decision or an advice especially when we see a dream?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nIstikhārah is to seek the guidance of Allah Ta’ala.\n\nAllah Ta’ala is ῾ālimul ghaib (Knower of the unseen). As human beings we are trapped in not knowing the future. Our intelligence and insight is also limited. If we knew what the future holds for us or had absolute intelligence, then we would probably not made any wrong decisions. In life we have to make some vital decisions and cannot afford making a mistake in that. We thus consult (Mashwarah) appropriate people and also make Istikhārah (seek divine guidance).\n\nIn Istikhāra, Allah guides us to what is good or bad for us in whatever we are seeking guidance in. The decision is left up to us. Ultimately only that will happen which is in the absolute knowledge of Allah.\n\nSeeing a dream in Istikhārah is not necessary. When one makes Istikhārah correctly and with a balanced mind, the feeling that comes in the heart is guidance from Allah. If one is doubtful when making Istikhārah, the Istikhārah should continue until one is satisfied. A dream in Istikhārah could also be an indication to the guidance sought.\n\nIt is best to refer to a learned pious person to interpret the dream. If a person makes Istikhārah and made a decision and then realised having made a mistake in the decision, then that is because:\n\n·        The Istikhārah was not correctly carried out. OR\n\n·        Made Istikhārah with a preconceived mind. The dream in Istikhārah was a reflection of ones thought. OR\n\n·        Still in doubt and terminating the Istikhārah and making a hasty decision. OR\n\n·        The dream was incorrectly related or interpreted.\n\n \n\nIf the Istikhārah was correctly carried out then the only reason for the adverse conditions is Taqdīr. As muslims, it is wājib to submit to Taqdīr.\n\n \nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best, \n \nMuftī Ebrahim Desai"
