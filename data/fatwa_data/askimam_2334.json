  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am an engineer and I had a deep interest in my field (actually I still do) however the state of this ummat grieves me so much that I do not feel like doing anything. In an ideal world I would have liked to have done research for the benifit of the ummat. I am not one of those people who just studied froma 'western' point of view. I have always made an effort to acquire knowledge of the deen and to spread it to others. Yet in both the matters of technological science and Quranic memorization and Fiqh I am still just average. I am also planning to get married, insha Allah. Should my emphasis be more on Deen or service of the ummat through acquiring further scientific knowledge or like at present both? Secondly, I have a severe concentration problem especially in Salat. Doctors prescribe medicine but it just makes me sick and I am afraid of it's side effects. This makes me very unmotivated and depressed. What should I do? Jazak Allah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is necessary for the Muslim Ummah to have their own engineers, doctors,%0D%0Aetc. Therefore, one may attain any type of knowledge as long as it is in%0D%0Aconformity to the Shari'ah, and with the intention of aiding the Muslim%0D%0AUmmah and freeing them from slavery of the west. If we do not have our own%0D%0Aengineers, doctors, etc. then, we will be compelled to go to the Kuffaar for%0D%0Aour needs. However, always keep this in mind that I am first a Muslim, then%0D%0Aan engineer, etc. (If the Muslim scientist of Pakistan did not create their%0D%0Aown nuclear weapons then .)%0D%0A%0D%0ARegarding concentrating in Salaat, one should note that Allah Ta'ala has%0D%0Amade each person responsible to concentrate according to his capability.%0D%0ATherefore, one should not resort to medication or other srastic measures, in%0D%0Aorder to attain total concentration. Yes, one should endervour to keep one's%0D%0Amind in Salaat as far as possin;e. a simple method which would help one to%0D%0Aattain concerntation in Salaat, is that one should firstly pause for a few%0D%0Aseconds before Salaat, and ask oneself, 'Who am I standing in from of and%0D%0Awhat am I about to perform?'. Then begin and concentrate on your postures.%0D%0ALook at how you feet are positioned, how have you tied your hands, etc. then%0D%0Aconcentrate on your recitation. Listen to yourself as if you are listening%0D%0Ato someone else. And read with this thought in mind that Allah Ta'ala has%0D%0Arequested you to recite the noble Qur'aan to him. If you are following an%0D%0AImaam, then follow his recitation attentively. Secondly, time permitting,%0D%0Ayou may perform daily 4 - 8 Rakaats of Nafl Salaat consecutively. In the%0D%0Afirst 2 Rakaats, you may find your mind wavering after 1 %BD a Rakaat, in the%0D%0Asecond two Rakaats after 1 Rakaats, and so on. Continue till you train%0D%0Ayourself to concentrate for a full 4 Rakaat Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
