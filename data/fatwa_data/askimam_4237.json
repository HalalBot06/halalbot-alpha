  "question": "If I am sick with cold or flu like symptoms, is it preferred for me to pray at home, rather than going to the Masjid, for the sake of not spreading it to other Muslims",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nOr, do I hold on to the belief that all good and bad occurs only by the will of Allah s.w.t., and my constant sneezing, etc., will not be the cause for other people to get sick? Generally under these circumstances, one?s employer would not want them to come to work, so that the sickness does not spread to other employees.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two views among the Ulama regarding contagious diseases and%0D%0Asickness. According to Hafiz Ibn Hajr Al-Asqalani, there is no contagious%0D%0Adiseases and sickness. Rasulullah (SAW) said -Laa-Adwae (mishkaat)-(there is%0D%0Ano thing contagious). According to Usman Ibn Salaah, diseases being%0D%0Acontagious are possible. This view is supported by the following hadith -%0D%0ARun from a Majzoom (person having leprosy) as fast as you would run from a%0D%0Alion. (Tirmidhi). Hence the meaning of the hadith presented in favour of a%0D%0Adisease being contagious is diseases are not independently contagious. It is%0D%0Athrough associating with one another. As this world is Darul-Asbaab (world%0D%0Aof cause and effect), Just as many aspects of this world, climate, etc,%0D%0Aaffect us, so too associating with ill people also effects us. However,%0D%0Aevery effect is with the order of Allah. Only He may put effect in the%0D%0Ameans if He wishes to. In view of the above, we advise that if your medical%0D%0Apractitioner has advised that your sickness is highly contagious then you%0D%0Ashould perform salaah at home until you recover.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
