  "question": "Can we take hand and do dua after Fardh Salaah or is it bidah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nmy husband is working in a construction company and in administrative sector in saudi arabia he has to deal with all insurance companies of health ,vehicle of that company related so is his income halaal;and even is his job right will he be involved in assisting sin please answer soon remember in your duas\n\ncan we take hand and do dua after farz namaaz or is it bidah and is this correct belief that angels dont come next to women when their head is uncovered as now some people in saudi say u should not cover your head when u do dua or in gathering as there is no hadith saying this and they are making women remove head cover in a women only gathereing\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh  \n\n \n\nThere are three aspects regarding your question.\n\n1)  Your husband's income being Halāl.\n\n2)  Du̒a after farz Salāh.\n\n3)  Head cover for women.\n\nAnswers in respect to the questions.\n\n1) Due to the fact that your husband works for a construction company and not directly involved with insurance, his income will be halāl. Regarding assistance in sin, I have attached a beneficial link below.[1]\n\n______________________\n\n2) To make Musāfaha (shaking hands) in general is Sunnah. However, to shake hands after Salāh is a custom and does not conform to the Sunnah of Rasullullah Sallallāhu ̒alayhi Wasallam nor the Sahābah Radhiyallāhu ̒anhum.\n\n Du̒a after the Farz Salāh is Mustahab[2]. Among the Du̒as and Adthkār to be read after Salāh are:\n\na) Astaghfirullah (thrice) and say \"Allahuma antas Salām wa minkas Salām Tabārakta Yā dthal Jalāli wal Ikrām\"[3]\n\nb) Recite Tasbih Fatimi (i.e. Subhānallah x33, Alhamdulillah x33, Allahu Akbar x34)\n\nc) Recite Āyatul kursi.\n\n___________________________\n\n3) Regarding wearing a head cover, it is important for women to always have their head covered, especially when she has to be in the company of others. She should not feel obliged to remove her scarf nor expose any part of her body for anyone, even in a gathering of women only.\n\n  Almighty Allah says in the holy Quran:\n\n\"Oh Nabi! Say to your wives, your daughter's and the believing women to bring down over themselves (part) of their outer garments.[4] That is more suitable that they will be known (as chaste believing women)and not be abused.\"\n\nThe above Āyat mentions that a chaste woman is known through her outer garments which portrays her modesty, and  modesty is important in the life of a believer.\n\n Rasullulah Sallallāhu ̒alayhi Wa Sallam has said:\n\n\"Modesty only brings good.\"[5]            \n\n\"Modesty is part of Imān and Imān is in Jannah. Obscenity is from aversion and aversion is in Jahannam.\"[6]\n\nFrom the above  Āyat and Ahādith the importance of modesty is clear. Therefore, those who encourage women to remove their scarves claiming that there is no Hadith saying a woman should cover her head when making du̒a or in a gathering are incorrect.\n\nRather, they cannot present a Hadith to prove their false claim.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl.

(Al Qurān , 33:59 pg. 590 Al Muntada)\n\n[5] قال النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم الحياء لا يأتي إلا بخير (Bukhāri vol.7-8 pg.130 Dārul Fikr)\n\n \n\n[6] عن ابي هريرة قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم الحياء من الإيمان والإيمان في الجنة والبذاء من الجفاء والجفاء في النار\n\n(Tirmidhi  p21 vol2باب الحياء H.M.
