  "question": "Obeying parents against acts that are not wajib but sunnah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI understand that one should not obey their parents if they say to trim the beard under a fist b/c it is wajib to leave the beard. However, what if they tell you not to do things that are sunnah, ie: don't wear kuffi, don't wear Islamic clothing, etc?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn view of the bombings of the twin towers of the TWC and the pentagon and\nrepercussions on the Muslims in the US, it may well be that your parents are\nconcerned about your safety.\n\nIn principle, if one fears victimized because of his Islamic attire, he will\nbe excused for not donning the Islamic attire only and until there is no\nrecourse of protection in any way. In a normal situation, one is required to\ndon the Islamic attore.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
