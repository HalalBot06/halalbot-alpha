  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI wanted to find out if one touches a leather jacket, and it is made out of pig skin, do you have to go and wash your hands? What should a person do? I ask because everywhere you see these days, people are wearing leather jackets and most of the big clothing stores only sell leather jackets made out of pig skin. Is it wrong ofÂ  me to assume that the leather jackets these people are wearing is made out of pig skin? If i dont' know what kinda leather was used, should i just take it as if i am unaware and i will not be punished for it?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nA pig skin is completely impure. Therefore, anything made out of pig skin is not permissible to use. However, touching something dry, i.e. leather jackets, does not make one impure. There will be no need to wash the hands.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
