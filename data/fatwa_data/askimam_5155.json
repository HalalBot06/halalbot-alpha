  "question": "What Dhikr should I do to purify my heart?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1)What zikr should I be doing to purifying my heart and my intention and ensuring I do amal?s (eg. Zikr, quran reading etc) for the pleasure of Allah swt alone? I do not have any access to a shaykh or reputable scholars in the area I live (as is your response to question 1906). 2) I am 8 months pregnant alhamdulillah. I read the Quran but not according to the right tajweed ? that is the words are correct but I have never been able to learn to read in the flowing style of many alim?s or alima?s. To ensure its correct I read by following website www.quraan.com and following ayats word by word by clicking on whichever surah I like.\n\nIs this acceptable, as my intention is for the baby to listen to the Quran and be accustomed to it? Also when reading, the alim reads faster than I do so if I skip a word but the alim reads it, is this acceptable? Or should I just read the Quran myself hoping to be forgiven for any mistakes I may possible make and be rewarded for the amal? 3) If I have a daughter I would like to name her after my mother-in-law, Fareedah, who died 2 years ago. Her mother (my husbands grandmother) died when she was a young child, her father then left her in my father-in-law who made her lifetime extremely difficult.\n\nWould it be wise to name my daughter after her or would it be a bad omen, considering that everyone?s fate is destined and not every Fareedah will have the same outcome.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. One of the zikrs that one may read is \"Ya muqallibal Quloob thabit Qalbiy ala Deenik\". When you start any Ibaadah always say that this act of Ibaadah is for the pleasure of Allah only. This will help in the process of purification. ( also refer to our section on supplications).\n\n\n2. There is no prohibition to use the internet to learn the Quraan, however, it is better to have a teacher who would be able to correct and assist you.\n\n\n3. The name of the person that you have known ie. your mother-in-law has noÂ bearing on your child. This is just superstitution and has no place in Islam.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
