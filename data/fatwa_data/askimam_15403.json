  "question": "Is there any Kaffarah for a deceased?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI want to know whether there is any kaffarah for missing salat by a deceased person owing to his/her sickness till his/her death. If there is any what is the rate or price of that kaffarah in kind or in cash.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n \n\nIf the mayyit was incapacitated to the extent that he/she could not perform the salaah by way of Ishaarah (performing the postures of Salaah through signs/movements of the head), fidyah will not be necessary. Fidyah will only become necessary if the mayyit had missed salaah that he/she was in the position to perform salaah even through Isharaah (head movements)- (Tahtaawi Page 464/5)\n\nThe amount may be given in cash or kind.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
