  "question": "What are the implacations of Salaat? (Generally in a work environment or in day to day life.)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo perform Salaat is an express order of Allah Ta?ala and is Fardh. Every Salaat must be performed timeously. That includes Salaat at work, whether during the day or night. Being at work does not excuse a person from performing Salaat.\n\nEvery endervour should be made to perform Salaat there. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Salaat is the pillar of Deen. Whosoever upholds Salaat, upholds Deen and whosoever discards Salaat discards Deen.? Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) also said, ?The difference between Imaan and Kufr is Salaat. The first thing a person will be accounted for on the day of Qiyaamat will be Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
