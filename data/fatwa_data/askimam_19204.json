  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. what can you do to leftover foods like chapatti etc because you cannot give it to the ducks etc as you will be fined and when you give it to the birds they dont eat it so we give them birds seed.so can we throw it away or not?\n\n2. you've got a house in pakistan 3 floors.Bottom floor has 4 houses on rent and the rest 2 floors is used by my dads family back home. do we have to give zakaat on the rent of those houses as they are extra.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nSister in Islam,\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nYou may consider crushing the chapati and placing it on the trails of ants.\n\nThere is no Zakat payable specifically on rentals received.\n\nThe rentals received will form part of the other cash and the decision of Zakat payable on the cash will depend upon the individual’s financial calculation. Broadly, if there is only cash and no liabilities or the cash exceeds the liabilities, then the cash will be subject to Zakat. You may refer to the attached for further clarity on calculation of Zakat.\n\nCalculating Zakah:\n\nZakāh will become compulsory on a sane and mature Muslim when his / her wealth exceeds the Nisāb and this amount of wealth is maintained for the duration of one entire lunar year.\n\nThe Nisāb is 20 Mithqals (87.479 g) for gold and 200 Dirhams (612.35 g) for silver. Any currency equal to the amount of any of these Nisābs will also render Zakāh binding.\n\nFor example, if the price of silver is quoted at R4.40 per gram then the Nisāb will equal approximately R2, 702. If one’s wealth decreases below the Nisāb during the year but before the expiry of the year, it reaches the Nisāb, Zakāh will be binding contrary to the case of the wealth not rebounding to amount of Nisāb upon the expiry of the year. However, if one loses his entire wealth, a new lunar cycle will begin after reaching the Nisāb for the second time. All debts and liabilities will be deducted from his wealth before calculating his estate.\n\nOnly that particular year’s liabilities will be deducted from long-term debts such as car / home financing. Loans given and other receivables into one’s estate will be accounted for even if the person is not paid by his debtor for several years. Any gold or silver items such as jewelry, ornaments etc will also form part of Zakatable assets.\n\nIf the percentage of gold or silver in the item is more than the metal alloy with which it is amalgamated the entire item will be considered as gold or silver. If the percentage of alloy is greater, if there is enough gold or silver where it is possible for it to be extracted, then Zakāh will be compulsory only on the value of the gold or silver therein and not on the entire item if the Nisāb is reached. \n\nSimilarly, any items purchased for trade will be subject to Zakāh and must be accounted for in the calculation. A person should add his / her cash savings, values of gold and/or silver, value of the merchandise of trade and any receivables from debts etc. Thereafter, he / she should deduct the amount of debts owed to others. If the value of the net total equals the Nisāb of gold or silver, he / she will have to pay 2.5% of the amount in Zakāh.\n\nHereunder is a brief chart illustrating the calculation of Zakāh:\n\nPersonal Wealth\n\n\t\n\nAmounts:\n\n\n\n\n1.   Amount of Cash and Savings at home or in the bank\n\n\t\n\nR 10,000\n\n\n\n\n2.   Current value of any gold and silver jewelry, coins, utensils etc\n\n\t\n\nR 5,000\n\n\n\n\n3.   Value of  assets and merchandise for trade\n\n\t\n\nR 20,000\n\n\n\n\n4.   Receivables and loaned amounts to others\n\n\t\n\nR 5,000\n\n\n\n\nTotal these amounts here:\n\n\t\n\nR 40,000\n\n\n\n\nAmount Debts to be paid:\n\n\t\n\nR 20,000\n\n\n\n\nSubtract the total amount of debts for the year from the above amount.\n\n\t\n\n\nNett Total of Zakatable Wealth\n\n\t\n\nR 20,000\n\n\n\n\nif the net total of Zakatable Wealth is more than the Nisab amount then…\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMultiply the nett total by 2.5% (nett amount x 0.025)\n\n\t\n\nR 500\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\n \n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
