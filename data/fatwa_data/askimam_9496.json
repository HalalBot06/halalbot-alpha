  "question": "Is it Bidah to say Sadaqullaahul Azeem after reciting quran?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) I read in different places that saying Sadaqulaahul Azeem after reciting a portion from the Quraan is Bidat, as it was not recited by Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam). Is this true? 2) Can you tell me a dua or a method on how to increase the growth of my beard? At the moment I have only few strands, which grow quite slowy. 3) Can you relate to me a hadith which informs us as to which is the best deed? I have read one that starts with salaat, obedience to parents, and then going out for Jihad in the path of Allah Ta'ala. I have also read one that says there is one exeption, which is going in the path of Allah Ta'ala with everything and not returning. However, I do not remember the whole hadith. Can you relate to me the whole hadith and the reference? 4) How long does it take to complete a Mufti course?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Bid'at literally means innovation. In Shari'ah, it means to introduce or innovate something which is not in the Qur'aan and Sunnah, and understand and consider it to be part of Deen. Sadaqallaahul-adheem after recital of the Qur'aan is done as an adab (etiquette) of recital. It is not done as a Sunnah or Mustahabb of Fardh. It will not be permissible.

Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), in different circumstances, situations and conditions for different people prescribed different A'amaal (actions), e.g. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Jihaad is the best action', but refused a Sahabi (Radhiallaahu Anhu) permission to go for Jihaad and instructed him to look after his parents. The Sahaabi (Radhiallaahu Anhu) looking after his parents in this case was more better than Jihaad. All actions will be rewarded, be it Salaat, fasting, Zakaat, etc. as long as it is done sincerely and with the right intention. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'The most loved actions are which are continuous even though it be minimal.'%0D%0A%0D%0A4.
