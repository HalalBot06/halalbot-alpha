  "question": "Does giving frozen maternal milk to an adoptive baby make it mahrem to me & other members of my family? What about the quantity of milk?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nalthough I have frozen a small amount - I need to know ASAP because my youngest child is already being weaned. Therefore I need to know how much and whether or not I should express more milk. Jazakallahu khairan ma-assalama\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, breast milk, whether fresh or frozen given\nto any child (including adoptive) within the first two years, causes\nHurmat-e-Radha`at (prohibition of foster relations).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
