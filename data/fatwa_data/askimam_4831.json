  "question": "I want to know the proper way to have Istunjah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamakum, Dear Mufti Sahib, I want to know the proper way to have Istunjah(cleaniness after using bathhroom.) I know its sunnah to use water, but if some one uses water he has to use hands to rub the areas on private parts and in such case he might get some waste on the hands. Is that acceptible, or makrooh. In modern days like today if some one only uses tissue paper to wipe off the watse and later use a wet tissue paper to wipe off the anal area is that enuf. In short what are the fards and sunnah of all this. If some one release air, the wudu breaks, now does he or she has to wash the anal area in order to make new wudu or can he make wudu with out wiping and washing private areas. waslamakum\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe aspect of Istinjaa and cleanliness is indeed a very important issue. A%0D%0Aperson should exercise extreme precaution in matters related to this. In the%0D%0AHadith, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has warned us, 'Stay away from%0D%0Aurine because generally the Adhaan of Qabr is attained through it.'%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala praises the people of Qubaa thus, 'In it are men who love to%0D%0Aclean and to purify themselves, and Allah loves those who make themselves%0D%0Aclean and pure (i.e. who clean their private parts with dust (which has%0D%0Aproperties of soap) and water from urine and stool after answering the call%0D%0Aof nature).'%0D%0A%0D%0AAccording to an Aayat, when this Aayat was revealed, Nabi (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) sent for Umaym ibn Saa'ida and asked him what is the%0D%0Apurification Allah has praised you for. He replied, 'O Rasul of Allah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), no man or woman comes out from relieving%0D%0Ahimself except that he washes his private parts.' Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) said, This is it.' (Ibn Kathir vol.2 pg.397; Qadeemi)%0D%0A%0D%0AIstinjaa (to cleanse) the private parts is Sunnat Muakkadah. A person can%0D%0Asuffice only on stone or tissue paper as long as the waste does not surpass%0D%0Athe private parts. If it did surpass then to use water is Fardh. However,%0D%0Athe best and most cautious method is to use both the stone or toilet paper%0D%0Aand water at all times. (Tahtawi pg.35)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is not necessary to wash the anal area after the release of air in order%0D%0Ato make Wudhu.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
