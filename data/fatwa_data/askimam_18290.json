  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalam o Alekum. I have a question and will be highly appreciative if u can guide me. I saw my wife's chatting with some guy and in anger i holded Quran in my hand and said that while having Allah (swt) as witness u will be diveroced if u ever chat or talk with someone (even cousins), even on phone. My main intention was to frighten her so she doesnt do it again as it bothers me that my wife chats or talks with Namahrams. Then i thought about it, now i wanna take back my words, she has also apologized. If she does talk to someone would that mean that a divorce will take place automatically? I am also very sorry for my action out of anger. Please guide me in this matter. Thank you\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\nIt is highly irresponsible of you to utter statements of such magnitude in a state of anger.  You should always be cognizant of the following āyah:\n\nمَا يَلْفِظُ مِنْ قَوْلٍ إِلَّا لَدَيْهِ رَقِيبٌ عَتِيدٌ (ق: 18) \n\nNot a word does he utter except there is a watcher by him ready (to record it) (Qur’ān 50:18)\n\nIf, by your statement, you meant that if your wife ever chats or talks to a non-mahram in the future, then you will divorce her at that time, then a divorce will not automatically take place if your wife does the act. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
