  "question": "Imam Abu Hanifa saw a dream where he conversed with Allah and Allah advised him to recite a dua. Could you tell me the dua?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllaamah Najm al-Ghaytee reports that Imaam Abu Hanifa [ra] has mentioned, ?I saw Allah in my dreams ninety nine times. Then I told myself, ?If I see Allah the hundredth time, I will ask Him how can the creation attain salvation on the day of Qiyaamah.? Then I saw Allah the hundredth time, thus I asked, ?O my Rabb, honoured is your proximity, exalted are your praises and sanctified are your names. How can the creation attain salvation on the day of Qiyaamah?? Allah Ta?ala replied, ?Whoever reads in the morning and evening, ?Subhaana abadiyyil abad, Subhaanal waahidil ahad, Subhaanal Fardis samad, Subhaana raafi?is samaa-i bi ghair amad. Subhaana man basatal arda alaa maa-in jamad, Subhaana man khalaqa fa ahsaahum adad, Subhaana man qasamar rizaqa wa lam yousa ahad. Subhaanallazi la yattakhiz saahibatan walaa walad, Subhaanallazi lam yalid wa lam yuwlad walam yakun lahu kufuwan ahad? will be saved from my punishment.
