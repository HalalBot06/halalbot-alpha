  "question": "Are there any good innovations in Islam (eg. using tasbih beads, having zikr gatherings, having madressahs)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. To introduce something which is not part of Deen into Deen and engage in%0D%0Ait as part of Deen or to regard something that is not compulsory in Deen as%0D%0Acompulsory is Bid'ah. If it is considered as a practice of Deen or it is%0D%0Aregarded as necessary, it will be Bid'ah. Hadhrat Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha)%0D%0Anarrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Whosoever%0D%0Ainitiated in this matter of our (Deen) that which is not part of it, is%0D%0Arejected.' (Mishkaat)%0D%0A2. The idea is to count the Dhikr. Be it counted with the fingers or with%0D%0Abeads, both are permissible. It is recorded in Abu-Dawood Shareef that some%0D%0ASahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhu) had beads (seeds) which they used to use to%0D%0Acount Dhikr.%0D%0A3. Kindly refer attached - Dhikr.%0D%0A4. The first Madrasah was established by Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) and the students (his Sahaaba) at that Madrasah were known as%0D%0AAs-haabus-Suffa. Therefore, the concept of a Madrasah is not Bid'at.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the recent past, some Ulama of our country have commenced special types%0D%0Aof Dhikr programmes in Masaajids. Since our community was not previously%0D%0Aexposed to these special types of Dhikr propgrammes, the Madrasah has been%0D%0Ainundated with calls regarding the Shar'ee status of such programmes.%0D%0AHereunder is a detail understanding on the issue.%0D%0A%0D%0ADhikr in the Qur'aan%0D%0AO You who believe! Remember Allah abundantly . (Ahzaab)%0D%0A%0D%0ADhikr in the Hadith%0D%0AAbdullah ibn Busr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that one person said, 'O%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) the laws of Islam are many, inform%0D%0Ame of only one thing that I may follow.' Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) said, 'Keep your tongue moist in the Dhikr of Allah.' (Ibn Majah%0D%0Avol.4 pg.244)%0D%0A%0D%0ASoft and Individual Dhikr%0D%0AAbu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) said that Allah Ta'ala said, 'I deal with my slave according to%0D%0Athe thought he has of Me, I am with him when he remembers Me. If he%0D%0Aremembers me individually, I remember him individually.' (Bukhari)%0D%0A%0D%0ACollective Dhikr%0D%0AHadhrat Anas bin Maalik (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'No group of people gather to make Dhikr%0D%0Aof Allah Ta'ala with sincerity except that a caller from the skies announces%0D%0Aafter the Dhikr. Leave in the condition that you have been forgiven of your%0D%0Asins and your evils being converted to virtue.' (Musnad Ahmad 9864)%0D%0A%0D%0ADhikr in the Musjid%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'When you pass the gardens of paradise,%0D%0Apluck the fruits.' Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was asked, 'What%0D%0Aare the gardens of paradise O Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).' He%0D%0Asaid, 'The Masaajid.' He was asked about plucking its fruits, he said,%0D%0A'Subhaanallah, Alhamdulillah, Laa Ilaaha illa Allaahu and Allaahu Akbar.'%0D%0A(Mishkaat pg.70; Qadeemi)%0D%0A%0D%0ALoud Dhikr in the Masjid%0D%0AIbn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that loud Dhikr after Fardh Salaat%0D%0Awas the practice during the time of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam). (Bukhari vol.1 pg.116)%0D%0A%0D%0A%3EFrom the above quotations, the following is proven:%0D%0A1. Importance of Dhikr%0D%0A2. Soft and individual Dhikr%0D%0A3. Collective Dhikr%0D%0A4. Dhikr in the Musjid%0D%0A5. Loud Dhikr in the Musjid%0D%0A%0D%0AThe special types of Dhikr conducted by certain Ulama are not exactly proven%0D%0Afrom the Qur'aan and Ahaadith but not prohibited too. These types of Dhikr%0D%0Aare adopted as a spiritual remedy and for spiritual upliftment. Some foods%0D%0Aare consumed for medical purposes and administered by a Physician as a%0D%0Aphysical remedy. Similalr,y Dhikr is also administered by spiritual leaders%0D%0Aaccording to the spiritual needs of the individual. A child in the Madrasah%0D%0Ais taught Nourani Qaaidah to enable him to recite the Qur'aan. Just as no%0D%0Aproof is required for the specifics of administering medication and teaching%0D%0ANourani Qaaidah, similarly, no profession and as long as there is no express%0D%0Aor indicative prohibition in Shari'ah, it will be permissible, just as%0D%0Aadministering medication and teaching Nourani Qaaidah are permissible.%0D%0A%0D%0AConsider the following conclusion of Moulana Zafar Ahmad Thanwi:%0D%0AIt is clear to follow the part proven from Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) and the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) is more virtuous, although%0D%0ADhikr is permissible in every language, way and form. (I'ilaaus Sunan vol.17%0D%0Apg.452)%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, in order to avoid imitating a musical chorus, the gathering should%0D%0Anot make Dhik in unison. (Fataawa Mahmoodiya vol.15 pg.102)%0D%0A%0D%0A%3EFrom the aforegoing discussion, apart from Dhikr being encouraged and%0D%0Ameritorious from the administrative point of view, the specific types of%0D%0ADhikr in the Masaajid, at most is Mubaah and the Shar'ee principles%0D%0Asurrounding a Mubaah act must be adhered to. Firstly, it is not correct to%0D%0Aimpose or prohibit one another from a Mubaah act. Imposing will be%0D%0Apurporting the act to be compulsory and prohibiting it will be purporting it%0D%0Ato be prohibited. Any Mubaah act being purported as compulsory or prohibited%0D%0Aprojects an incorrect and unbalanced view, thus, creating the possibility%0D%0Aof distortion in Deen. Therefore, those participating in programmes should%0D%0Anot regard the specific programme as Fardh, Waajib or Sunnah or should not%0D%0Aimpose on others to participate. Similarly, those who do not participate%0D%0Ashould not condemn those participating in programmes. Secondly, the Mubaah%0D%0Aact should not be of any inconvenience to another person. It should not%0D%0Adisturb a person performing Salaat, reciting the Qur'aan or a Mu'takif%0D%0Asleeping in the Musjid. (Shaami vol.1 pg.488; Pakistan). Since disturbing%0D%0Aothers could lead to a dispute the trustees should efficiently exercise%0D%0Atheir authority in regulating such affairs. Just as it is Mubaah to recite%0D%0Athe Qur'aan audibly in the Musjid, the reciter would be restricted to do so%0D%0Aduring the congregational Salaat. Likewise, just as is Mubaah to conduct the%0D%0ATabligh programmes in the Musjid, it is regulated by the Trustees according%0D%0Ato the circumstances surrounding the Musjid. Similarly, Dhikr programmes are%0D%0AMubaah and must be regulated by the Trustees in order to avoid any possible%0D%0Adisputes. The Aalim and his followers are bound to respect the%0D%0Aadministration principles of the Musjid and if they do not abide by the%0D%0Aprinciples set out by the Trusees, the Trustees can terminate such%0D%0Aprogrammes. Such restriction will not fall within the parameters of%0D%0Aoppressing and restricting one from taking the name of Allah in the Musjid%0D%0Aas the Trustees will not be prohibiting them from performing their Fardh%0D%0ASalaats and remembering Allah therein.%0D%0A%0D%0AThirdly, if a dispute arises between the husband and the wife in%0D%0Aparticipating in such a programme, the wife is bound to respect her husband'%0D%0As view.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, the Dhukr should be conducted by a learned Aalim.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
