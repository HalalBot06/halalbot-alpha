  "answer": "QUESTION\n\na friend of mine would like to know if  it is haram to masterbate, and if it is why?\nthey  also would like to kn0w..if a person does masterbate due to the reason that it might cause them to perform zina are they allowed to masterbate..?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh.\n\nTo have intercourse or release semen unlawfully is prohibited in Islam.  The Qur’an describes the qualities of true believers and as follows:\n\n \n\nوَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِفُرُوجِهِمْ حَافِظُونَ .  إِلَّا عَلَى أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ غَيْرُ مَلُومِينَ . فَمَنِ ابْتَغَى وَرَاءَ ذَلِكَ فَأُولَئِكَ هُمُ الْعَادُونَ\n\nAnd those who guard their private parts, except from their wives or from those (bondwomen who are) owned by their hands, as they are not to be blamed. However, those that seek (sexual pleasure) beyond that are the transgressors.  (23/5-7 & 70/29-31)\n\n \n\nIbn Kathir (ra) commenting on the above verse writes:\n\nImam Shaf’ee (ra) and those sharing the same view take proof from this verse on the impermissibility of masturbation and says, “The disgraceful act (of masturbating) is not from these two (lawful) options and the verse states that ‘those that seek sexual pleasure beyond that are the transgressors’”.\n\n(Ibn Kathir (3/226) Dar al-Mufeed)\n\n \n\nAllama Alusi (ra) in Ruh al-Ma’ani under this verse writes:\n\nAnd there is a difference of opinion also on the issue of masturbation.  The majority of the Ulama are of the view of its prohibition.  And masturbation is included in the verse “and those that seek (sexual pleasure) beyond that…”\n\n \n\nAnd there are those who have deduced the prohibition of masturbation from other sources for example what the Mashaykh have said from hadith of Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam):\n\nناكح اليد ملعون\n\nCurse is upon those who have intercourse with their hands.\n\n \n\nSaeed ibn Jubayr (ra) narrates:\n\nAllah will punish those who fondle with their private parts.\n\n \n\nAata (ra) narrates that he heard:\n\nA nation will be resurrected such that their hand will be pregnant.  I believe they are the ones that masturbate.  And Allah Knows Best.\n\n(Ruh al-Ma’ani (9/213) Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyya)\n\n \n\n \n\nShariah recognizes the urge in youth to fulfill their carnal desires.  It is for this reason Rasullullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) said:\n\nعن عبد الله قال قال لنا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يا معشر الشباب من استطاع منكم الباءة فليتزوج فإنه أغض للبصر وأحصن للفرج ومن لم يستطع فعليه بالصوم فإنه له وجاء (متفق عليه)\n\n‘Abdullah ibn Mas’ud narrates that Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) said to us, “O youngsters, whom so ever amongst you are able to marry, then let him do so, for verily it helps lower the gazes and protects the private parts.  And who so ever does not have the ability to marry then let him fast, for it is a shield for him. (Sahih al-Bukhari & Sahih Muslim)\n\n \n\n \n\nThe Jurists have explained that if a person is in a situation where he is over powered by his desires and if he does not masturbate, and there is fear of him committing adultery, then it is hoped that he will be excused for masturbating.\n\nRad al-Muhtar (2/399) H.M. Saeed Company\n\n \n\nوكذا الاستمناء بالكف وإن كره تحريما لحديث { ناكح اليد ملعون } ولو خاف الزنى يرجى أن لا وبال عليه ...قال ابن عابدين: ( قوله : ولو خاف الزنى إلخ ) الظاهر أنه غير قيد بل لو تعين الخلاص من الزنى به وجب ؛ لأنه أخف وعبارة الفتح فإن غلبته الشهوة ففعل إرادة تسكينها به فالرجاء أن لا يعاقب\n\n \n\nIt should also be pointed out that a person should avoid any such act that will aggravate his desires.  He should lower his gaze, avoid mixed gatherings, avoid reading immoral literature, etc.  If one’s desires are aroused after guarding oneself from all forms of evil, then only will one be excused in an unavoidable situation.  The above ruling is not for a person who aggravates his desires and leads his passion to an unavoidable situation.  In that instance he will be sinful for leading himself to a point of aggravating circumstances of sexual desires and for masturbating.  For that he must repent for his sin and make effort to reform himself.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
