  "question": "Other than the combined salaah of a traveler, what other factors validates the combining of salaah for non-travelers?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nOther than the combined salaah of a traveler, what other factors validates the combining of salaah for non-travelers?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\n \n\nFrom the outset, it is essential to understand the concept of combining salah. According to the Hanafi Mazhab there are two dimensions pertaining to “combining” salah. The first relates to where, in reality, one salah is performed in another salah time, for example, the Asr salah is performed in the Zuhr time. In the second dimension however, both the salah are read within their individual allotted time but since they are performed so close to each other, it appears that one is read in the other salah time. For example, the Zuhr salah is performed just prior to the Zuhr time elapsing whilst the Asr salah is performed immediately upon entry of the Asr time.\n\nNow with the rulings –\n\nAs for the first dimension, where one salah is performed in another salah time, this is only permissible during the days of Hajj and on two occasions only (if the requirements are met). Nonetheless, the first occurs on the day of Arafah where the Asr salah is performed in the Zuhr time (Jam’a Taqdeem); whilst, the second occasion is in Muzdalifah, where the Maghrib salah is delayed and performed in the Esha time (Jam’a Ta’kheer).[1]\n\n(Al Bahrur Raiq Pg.1, Vol. 3)\n\nApart from the 9th day of Hajj, it is not permissible to combine two Salats in one time.  \n\nAs for the second dimension, where both the salah are read in their individual allotted time but since they are performed so close to each other, it appears that one is read in the other salah time. We should consider that the Jurists of Islam (Fuqaha) have stipulated preferable times during which the daily salah ought to be performed. For example, the Maghrib salah should be performed immediately after sunset, whilst Fajr should be performed about 20 minutes to half an hour before sunrise, etc. These times have been extracted from the Ahadith and life of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) and so, adhering to these is of great benefit and will assure our salah to be in constant check. Furthermore, on occasions of travel (as you have asked), illness, etc. if one cannot perform the salah on the recommended times, it may be performed in other suitable times (however, within that specified salah time, i.e. Asr in the Asr time, and Esha in the Esha time, and so on). Salah performed out of its stipulated time will render the salah qadha (postponing the salah), and one would be sinful for doing so.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net \n\n\n\n \n\n [1] ( قَوْلُهُ : وَعَنْ الْجَمْعِ بَيْنَ الصَّلَاتَيْنِ فِي وَقْتٍ بِعُذْرٍ ) أَيْ مُنِعَ عَنْ الْجَمْعِ بَيْنَهُمَا فِي وَقْتٍ وَاحِدٍ بِسَبَبِ الْعُذْرِ لِلنُّصُوصِ الْقَطْعِيَّةِ بِتَعْيِينِ الْأَوْقَاتِ فَلَا يَجُوزُ تَرْكُهُ إلَّا بِدَلِيلٍ مِثْلِهِ وَلِرِوَايَةِ الصَّحِيحَيْنِ قَالَ عَبْدُ اللَّهِ بْنُ مَسْعُودٍ { وَاَلَّذِي لَا إلَهَ غَيْرُهُ مَا صَلَّى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ صَلَاةً قَطُّ إلَّا لِوَقْتِهَا إلَّا صَلَاتَيْنِ جَمَعَ بَيْنَ الظُّهْرِ وَالْعَصْرِ بِعَرَفَةَ وَبَيْنَ الْمَغْرِبِ وَالْعِشَاءِ بِجَمْعٍ } ، وَأَمَّا مَا رُوِيَ مِنْ الْجَمْعِ بَيْنَهُمَا فَمَحْمُولٌ عَلَى الْجَمْعِ فِعْلًا بِأَنْ صَلَّى الْأُولَى فِي آخِرِ وَقْتِهَا وَالثَّانِيَةَ فِي أَوَّلِ وَقْتِهَا وَيُحْمَلُ تَصْرِيحُ الرَّاوِي بِالْوَقْتِ عَلَى الْمَجَازِ لِقُرْبِهِ مِنْهُ وَالْمَنْعُ عَنْ الْجَمْعِ الْمَذْكُورِ عِنْدَنَا مُقْتَضٍ لِلْفَسَادِ إنْ كَانَ جَمْعَ تَقْدِيمٍ وَلِلْحُرْمَةِ إنْ كَانَ جَمْعَ تَأْخِيرٍ مَعَ الصِّحَّةِ كَمَا لَا يَخْفَى ...
