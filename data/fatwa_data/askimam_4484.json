  "question": "In countries like Srilanka & India we start our fasting oneday later than the middle-eastern countries.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)Why cant the muslim world have one particular day where everyone starts the month of ramadhan & celebrate eid at the sametime. 2)This time there was chaos about the festival day. In theÂ  news that night they (the Ulema of the main mosque in the country) announced that Eid would be on monday. At 1:30 in the night it was announced that it was the festival day (thats sunday). nobody was ready, especially the women folk. & infact many people dint know that it was the festival day till morning.but apparantly there were two gropus of people where one group celebrated on sunday & the others on monday.whats the ruling regarding this & should the rest of us catch up on the fast that we missed?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe start and the end of the any month in the Islamic calendar expecially\nthe month of Ramadaan is based on the sighting of the Moon, as stated in the\nHadith narrarted in Sahih Muslim \"Fast when you see it (i.e. the moon) and\nbreak when you see it...\". The sighting of the moon by the people of the\ncountry or neigbouring countries is compulsory.\n\nThe idea of celebrating a unified Eid for the entire Ummah has been\ndiscussed and deliberated by leading Ulama for a considerable period of\ntime. Apart from the above quoted Hadith, there are also many academic\nissues that are to be considered to achieve the idea of a unified Eid. The\nmatter is still being deliberated. It is difficult for us to comment on the\nchaos regarding announcement of Eid in your country. We suggest you refer to\nthe reliable Ulama of your locality for advise.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
