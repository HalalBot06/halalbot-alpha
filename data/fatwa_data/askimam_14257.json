  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI know in hanafi fiqh man don’t have get permission from his first wife to have second wife. I have been asked by few people what is the proof of this from Qura’an and Hadith.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe Qur’aan permits one to take more than one wife and the only condition attached is equality between/among his wives. If the consent of the first wife was necessary, it should be there or at least in the Hadith or practise of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam].\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
