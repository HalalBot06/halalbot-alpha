We\nmake Du'aa that Allah Ta'ala assist and guide you.\n\nIn the circumstances that you are faced with, you have to have a lot of\npatience and be steadfast. We suggest that you continuously advise your\nhusband in a kind and loving manner. Speak to him, give him encouragement\nand gradually over a period of time win him over. Do not despair. Remember\nthat as long as you will be loyal to him even though he is disloyal to you,\nAllah Ta'ala is with you. Be confident, do not lose hope and on a daily\nbasis try to speak to him and advise him. You may even try to establish Ta'\nleem at home which will have a direct effect on him and everybody else.\n\nWe advise you adopt a Kitaab on Hadith and recite one or two Ahaadith daily\nbefore having meals.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
