  "question": "Is it permissible to continually move one's index finger during Tashah-hud (sitting position)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaam-hu-alaykum, Many of my esteemed friends provide evidence from a book called 'Prayer of the Prophet (SAW)' by Sheikh Muhammed Naasir-ud-deen Albanni. I am very confused and we seem to have endless debates on this issue as some argue that only a handful of hadith have been quoted where the Prohpet (SAW) moved his finger versus the hundreds which does not mention the continual movement of the finger. There is also some debate as to exactly when the finger should be extended and retracted. I would GREATLY appreciate your comments supported by referenced material. Wassalaam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nThere are two types of Ahaadith regarding the continual and non-continual\nmovement of the finger in Tashahhud.\n\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, the finger should not be continually moved.\n(Footnote No.5 Abu Dawud vol.1 pg.149). The index finger should be extended\nat 'Laa ilaaha' and retracted at 'illa llaah'. (Shaami vol.2 pg.218;\nPakistan)\n\nAccording to the Shaaf'ee Madhab, the index finger should be extended at\nextracted at 'illallaah' without it's continual movement. (Fiqhul Islaami\nvol.2 pg.218)\n\nAccording to the Maaliki Madhab, one should close his small finger and ring\nfinger and form a circle with his thumb and middle finger. (Fiqhul Islaai Wa\nAdillatuhu vol.2 pg.938). There is no mention whether the finger should be\nextended and retracted as well as whether it should be moved continuously or\nnot.\n\nand Alla"
