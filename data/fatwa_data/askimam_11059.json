  "question": "Is it still ok to pay that interest to the bank even if you are paying on time ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam Aleikum Could you please explain again about the using of a Credit card because it?s a bit confusing ? there will be something like ?Interest On Your Standard Balance?. Is it still ok to pay that interest to the bank even if you are paying on time ? ? if not can we just pay the amount we owe and ignore to pay the interest that we still be accountable for. Jazak Allah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe use of a credit card is permissible provided the cardholder pays the entire amount due on or before due date, otherwise the balance will attract interest.\n\nThe payment of interest is absolutely Haraam. Your question about ?paying interest to the bank even if you pay on time? is unclear. There is no interest if you pay on time. What do you mean?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
