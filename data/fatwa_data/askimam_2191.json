  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn particular should the Azaan be given before performing salaat,and if one is not sure if the Azaan is given what should one do?Also if you are late for the first Jamaat must one join this Jamaat or wait for more brothers to come and make another Jamaat. JazakAllah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAdhaan should be called before performing Salaat at a Jamaat Khana. The\ncongregational Salaat at the Jamaat Khana should be joined. However, if one\nmissed the complete Salaat, he may wait for others to perform the Salaat in\ncongregation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
