PLUS WE ARE WELL OFF ALHAMDULLIAH AND CAN OFFORD SEPARATE APARTMENT AS WELL\n\nJAZAKALLAH\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram\n\n \n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\n \n\nIf your husband is well off and he can provide you with a separate apartment where you can observe purdah from non-Mahrams, then it is necessary for your husband to make that arrangement for you. He will be answerable in the Court of Allah for the violation of the Laws of purdah if he does not make that arrangement for you.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
