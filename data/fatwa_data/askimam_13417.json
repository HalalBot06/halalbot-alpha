  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI was wondering weather it matters islamicly if i wear unislamic clothing (jeans etc.) underneath my abaya because my father disapproves of this . I feel more comfertable wearing it underneath my abaya as it does not bug me , but when i take my abaya off at home.. i change in to shalwar kameez. Can you please let me know if it is islamically incorrect?\n\nAn other question i have is that.. when ever i go some where and in between salaat time comes , i find a spot to pray.... but alot of people tell me.. \"your clothes are napak since you wheere an abaya.. and it touches the side walk etc. and your not sure that where ever your abaya has touched is clean or not.\".. I still pray.. but i wasnt sure if what there saying is correct?.. Is it true that i cant pray or it doesnt matter?\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. There are two issues to your dressing; a) Wearing un-Islamic clothing, b) Disapproval of father. You state you cover the un-Islamic clothing with your Abaya. You should also consider the pleasure of your father. If your father is displeased with you wearing such un-Islamic attire, you should not wear it in future. The pleasure of your father will be rewarding for you.\n\n2. The Abaya touching the side walk does not make the Abaya impure. The Salaat with the Abaya is correct.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
