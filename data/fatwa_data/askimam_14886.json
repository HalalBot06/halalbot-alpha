  "question": "Who are the friends of Allah mentioned in the Quran?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIn the Quraan-E-Kareem, it is mentioned in Sura Yunus, verse 62 “Lo verily the friends of Allah are those on whom fear comenth not nor do they grieve”. Please explain the ‘friends of Allah Ta’ala”\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAllah Ta`aala describes “the friends of Allah, as “those who have Imaan and who adopt Taqwa” (they do what Allah commands and refrain from what Allah prohibits).\n\nHadhrat Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas and many other commentators of the holy Quran have mentioned that “the friends of Allah” are such people that by merely looking at them one would remember Allah. This is mentioned in the following Hadith –\n\nعن ابن عباس قال: قال رجل: يا رسول الله، مَنْ أولياء الله؟ قال: \"الذين إذا رءُوا ذُكر الله\".\n\nIbn Abbas (RA) narrates that, a person asked: “Oh prophet of Allah, who are the friends of Allah”? He replied; “They are those that by seeing them one remembers Allah”.\n\nThe importance of adopting Taqwa is understood from this Hadith as this is the basis of being the friend of Allah. Once Taqwa enters into our hearts then our dressing, attire, appearance and dealings would conform to the sublime Sunnah of Nabi (SAW). It is this quality that reminds one of Allah.\n\nIn the following Hadith Nabi (SAW) describes “the friends of Allah” as those people who love each other for the sake of Allah and no other reason –\n\nعن أبي هريرة، رضي الله عنه، قال: قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم: \"إن من عباد الله عبادا يغبطهم  الأنبياء والشهداء\". قيل: من هم يا رسول الله؟ لعلنا نحبهم. قال: \"هم قوم تحابوا  في الله من غير أموال ولا أنساب، وجوههم نور على منابر من نور، لا يخافون إذا خاف الناس، ولا يحزنون إذا حزن الناس\". ثم قرأ: { أَلا إِنَّ أَوْلِيَاءَ اللَّهِ لا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ }\n\nAbdullah bin Mas`ud (RA) narrates that the prophet of Allah (SAW) said: “Verily from the servants of Allah are those whom the prophets and the martyrs envy”. Someone asked: “Who are those people, oh prophet of Allah, so that we may also love them”? He said: “those people who loved each other for the sake of Allah and not because of wealth or relations. Their faces will shine with Noor upon pillars of Noor. They will not fear when the people will fear and they will not grieve when the people will grieve. Then Nabi (SAW) recited the verse – Verily the friends of Allah are those on whom fear cometh not nor do they grieve”.  \n\nWe make dua that Almighty Allah make us from amongst His true pious servants and from amongst the friends of Allah.
