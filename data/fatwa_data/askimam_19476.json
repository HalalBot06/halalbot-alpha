  "answer": "QUESTION\nRevisiting the previous question about injecting brine solution in chicken carcass, what if some of them inject more then the required/recommended amount to increase the weight?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nThe ratio of the injected solution to that of the chicken carcass is set by the Legal Departments. If the injected brine solution is within these legal limits, and this information is displayed on the packaging then it will be permissible to sell that chicken. If someone injects more than the legal limit, then it will be impermissible.\n\nWhatever is injected has to be displayed on the packaging, as per the legal requirement to ward off any deception. If someone does not display the correct amount on the packaging then it will be regarded as deception and impermissible. \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Faisal bin Abdul Hameed\nStudent, Darul Iftaa\nCanada\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
