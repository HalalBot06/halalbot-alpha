  "question": "I saw a dream that my family and I were travelling to Madinah by car ...",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Around 2 months ago, I saw a dream that my family and I were travelling to Madinah by car. But I am not sure if it was for religious purpose. Along the trip we stopped under a huge mountain to pray. There were many people there. I don't remember this part very clearly, but I think Prophet Mohammed (SAW) was among those people?although I never saw him.I just heard that he was there. But what I definitely remember is that I heard is name for sure. I know that this might not be a significant dream for Mufi People like you, but to me this dreams means a lot. So could pls specifically tell me how this dream relates to ME? 2. Also, most of the dreams I see come true. For instance, many of the events that take place in my dreams come true or the people I dream about do the same thing or say the same thing as they did in my dream. Do u know why this happens? Thank you very much brother and may Allah (SWT) be pleased with you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream of traveling to Madina Munawwara and to be in the company of\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) on the way is indeed a blessed\ndream.\n\nAllah Ta'ala shows some future events to some of His chosen servants ahead\nof time through dreams. You may be one of them. You should thank Allah for\nthis bounty.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
