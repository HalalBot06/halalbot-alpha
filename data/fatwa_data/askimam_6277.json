  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease i have a friend on the internet for three to four years who is a man though we have never met we just mail each other.I want to stop mailing him now because i read that this is not allowed in Islam.Though i have other friends too who are mail but inshAllah by the grace of Allah i will stop mailing them as well.Can u please advice me of what should i tell him that why i am not going to mail him.Or should i just stop mailing him for no reason? will i be then accountable on the day of judgement for not telling him and making him angry on why i didnt mail him anymore. Thank you\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala says in the noble Qur'aan, 'O, you who believe, do not befriend my enemies .' (Surah 60:1)\n\nIt is Haraam for any female to unnecessarily converse with males other than\nher Mahrams. Similarly, using modern technology, via internet, etc. to\ncommunicate with Mahrams of the opposite gender is also prohibited.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
