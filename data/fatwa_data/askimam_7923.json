  "answer": "QUESTION\nI embraced to Islam a while ago. I am in the process of getting to know a muslim with the intention of marriage. Before my reversion I had a physical relationship with a man, which I deeply regret. Should I tell the prospective husband about this? What if he asks me about it?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?(acceptance of) Islam wipes out any sin committed prior to accepting Islam.?\n\nIn view of the above Hadith, it is our conviction that Allah has forgiven your sins committed before accepting Islam. Therefore, it is not necessary to tell your prospective husband about your past experience.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
