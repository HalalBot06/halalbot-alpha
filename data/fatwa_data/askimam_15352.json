  "question": "he wants me to have an abortion or he will divorce me...what are my rights in this matter?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni am one year marrried and have just found out that i am pregnant. me and my husband did not plan the baby yet now he blames me for falling pregnant and say that i lied about being on contraceptives and that betrayed him...he wants me to have an abortion or he will divorce me...what are my rights in this matter?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is our belief that a woman conceives only with the order and will of Allah. The practice of birth control methods is merely a means of not falling pregnant. The will and power of Allah can override all means. Therefore, your pregnancy should be viewed in that light. It is taqdeer. It is not correct for your husband to blame you for falling pregnant. It is a major sin to abort the pregnancy. We suggest a family meeting of elders be called up to discuss the issue. Nevertheless, if you have to choose between abortion and divorce, it will be meritorious for you to keep the child.\n\nIf you do not have the courage to bear a divorce and if you are compelled to abort, the burden of that major sin will rest on your husband’s shoulders. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
