  "question": "Why still Muslims all over the world are divided into groups calling themselves Sunni or Shia?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam alikum 1.I read on this site that 2sleep on one?s stomach is disliked by Allah Ta?ala. (Sunan Abi Dawud Hadith5001; Sunan Tirmidhi Hadith2768) & that this is the way the people of hell would lie down. (Sunan ibn Majah Hadith3724, 3725). But is it permissible to sleep on husbands chest after intercouse? 2.Why still Muslims all over the world are divided in2 groups calling themselves Sunni or Shia when based on Quran (Al-Imran 103/104/105) each Muslim has 2 call 4 good things, has 2 invite 2 Islam but not 2be selected from themselves (from Muslim) if I?m wrong in my understanding may Allah 4gives me..but there is not Sunni nor Shia in Quran.. 3. I heard from one Haji that we should not help people untill they ask us about help. He explains it like whatever you do in the end instead of ?thanks? you will hear blames ..is it true??? Is there such thing in Islam?? However I think we are helping in front of Allah from that what Allah gives us ( I mean power to help)..Should I really wait until somebody asks me??? Salam alikum\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is permissible.\n\n2. You are correct. If the Shi?as abide by the Qur?aan as understood in the light of the Hadith and the Sahaaba [Radhiallaahu anhum], there would be no division between Sunnis and Shi?as. May Allah guide the Shi?as on the straight path, Aameen.\n\n3. If one does not fear blame for assisting another, then one should offer his assistance without being requested. There is also nothing wrong in guarding oneself against accusation. Therefore, if one fears being accused, etc. for assisting, then he/she may wait until be requested assistance.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
