  "question": "Uncalled family arguments.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy brother is a newly wed who was requested by his wife to rent his own place immediately after marriage, which we carried out. The problem is our parents are retired and I basically take care of their expenses. The couple still have meals with our parents but does not assist with the expenses. Point to be taken into is the couple are both employed. My wife and I have continous arguments regarding this issue. Please assist/advice.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, we wish to state that to maintain family ties is Fardh. The\norder of maintaining family ties is replete in the noble Qur'aan and the\nAhaadith. A human being by nature is a disputer. Therefore, one must be\nconscious of both factors, maintaining family ties and disputing nature of\nmankind and display tolerance. It is important to suppress one's emotions\nand be rational as following the dictates of one's emotions may lead one to\nfurther difficulties.\n\nWe advise you and your wife be tolerant. In the meanwhile, you should seek\nan opportune moment and discuss the matter politely with your brother only.\nDue to the sensitivity surrounding the matter, we advise you exercise\nextreme precaution and wisdom and avoid any negative consequences which you\nand your family will remember for the rest of your lives.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
