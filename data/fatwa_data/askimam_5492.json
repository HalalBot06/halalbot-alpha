  "question": "Some people believe that the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasalam) is present every where.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it true that the third question that will be asked by the Angels of the grave is, \"Ma kunta taqulu fi haqqi hazar rajul\" (meaning : \"What did you have to say about this person?\" (i.e. the Prophet sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). It is said that when this question is asked the veil is removed from the dead person's eyes so that he can see the Holy Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) who will be present (Haazir) in the grave. (Mishkaat Shareef; Bukhaari) From this Hadith these people believe that the Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) is seen by the dead in person and not in some sort of mental thought, because the word \"rajul\" that is used in the question, in Arabic grammar refers to a real person made of flesh and bones. So it is established that every person that dies sees the Holy Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) in his grave in person. Now, at any given time thousands of people around the world are buried and all these people see the Holy Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) at the same time and are asked the same question. These people believe that this is ample proof that the Holy Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) by the Grace of Allah Ta'ala can present himself in many places at the same time and they say that all the 'Ulama of Ahl as-Sunna agree with this.... is this true? JazakAllah Khair Your Sister-in-Islam Zeenat Paruk\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHaazir (Omnipresent) and Naazir (Omniseeing) are the sole attributes of\nAllah.\n\nNo human being including our Nabiy (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) cannot be\nHaazir and Naazir. Our beloved Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is\nresting in Madinah Munawwarah. He informed us that when anyone sends Salaams\nto him, the angels convey the Salaam to him there.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
