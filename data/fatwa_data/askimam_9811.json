  "question": "Is egg donation allowed in islam? my sister can not ovulate. can i donate an egg to her for IVF procedure.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nLife is in the hands of Allah Ta'ala. He grants children to whomsoever He wishes. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) had desire to have male offspring, however, all of his 3 male offsprings had passed away prior to buloogh. Besides our mother Khadija (Radhiallaahu Anha), only Maariya al-Qibtiyya (Radhiallaahu Anha) bore Rasulullah's (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) children, inspite of our mother Hadhrat Aaisha being young and most fit to bear children.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe find that egg donation is tantamount to Zina. Sister A is a fertile lady who has no complications, while Sister B has a hormone unfitness. Sister A donates her egg to Sister B, which is fertlised by the semen of Sister B's husband. This is Haraam and illegal in Islamic law. The lineage of the child will also be confused, thus, causing confusion in the laws of succession.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is preferable that Sister A conceives a child by her husband and after birth, give the child to Sister B to adopt. The child will be attributed to Sister A and her husband, thus, not confusing the laws of inheritance.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
