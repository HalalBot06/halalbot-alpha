  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni  work in a bakery and recently they told me i have to touch bacon and make harram sandwiches is this allowed if yes/no why please?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is not permissible for you to touch the bacon (pork) as it is najis (impure). You should try and avoid any contact with it. If you are compelled, you should seek another suitable alternate job and quit this job. Until then repent to Allah for your shortcoming.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
