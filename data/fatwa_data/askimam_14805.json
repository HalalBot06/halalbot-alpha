  "question": "Can we say Mulla Ali Qari is reliable according to our Ulema...",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan we say Mulla Ali Qari is reliable according to our Ulema, even if he held the beliefs below of calling Allah’s helpers (the Angels, Jinn, or Walis)?\nAllama Jazri in his famous book “Hasnu Haseen” writes that if somebody wishes to get any help {from Allah (swt)}, he should call for his people/appointees (Wa in arada ‘aounan falyaqul a’eenooni ya ‘ibadallah a’eenooni ya ‘ibadallah a’eenooni). In its guidebook, Mulla Ali Qari says: if somebody lost his sheep in tropical forest should call the Allah’s (swt) helpers to make their task easy (Ida infalat dabbatu ahadikum fi ardhi falathin, faliyaqul ya ibadallah ihbisu) (almuradu bihi almalaikah minal jinne au rijjalul ghaibe almuslimoon bi abdalin). It means always the helpers of Allah (swt) are available and assigned for such help, they are angels, jinn or not appearing Muslim people (Abdaal: the great Wali). At the end Mr. Qari says that this Hadith is Hasan (the second top quality of Hadith).\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThis narration and practice is also recorded as well as recommended by the following authorities:\n\n \n\nImam Tabrani r.a in Al Mu’jamul Kabeer. (Vol 10. Pg. 267 & Vol. 17 Pg. 117)\nImam Abu Yahya in his Masnad (Hadeeth # 5269)\nImam Ibnus Sunni (Hadeeth # 508)\nImam Nawawi r.a in Al-Azkaar\nAllama Sakhawi r.a in Al Ibtihaaj (Pg. 61-62)\nIbn Hajjar Al Haitami r.a in Sharhul Idaah\nand others…\n\n \n\nImam Nawawi r.a has quoted other authorities that have practiced upon it. In fact he states that he also practiced upon it and he found it to be useful. (See Al-Azkaar)\n\n \n\nAl Shawkani r.a has stated the following in his commentary to Al Hisnul Haseen, “There is no real harm in this (although it seems like a form of shirk), just like there is no harm for one to seek assistance from any human for such a need. (Tuhfatul Zaakireen Pg. 202)\n\n \n\nThe respected Mulla Ali Qari r.a has also expressed the possibility of some chosen Human coming to his assistance.  This would be proper as long as one does not intend anyone specific with the belief that this specific person has full authority within his own self to render assistance.\n\n \n\nMufti Ashiq Ilahi states in his commentary, “This narration should not be misused to justify the wrong belief that people have regarding certain Awliyaa etc.”\n\n \n\nNote: In the last line of your query the following appears, “Mr. Qari”. If this was intended then we vehemently discourage you from such disrespect to an acclaimed scholar of deen. If it was a typing error, then ignore this note.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\n \n\n \n\nMaulana Mohammed ibn Haroon Abbasoomer\n\n \n\nDarul Hadith\n\n \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
