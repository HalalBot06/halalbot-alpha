  "question": "I was wondering whether or not it is permissible to drink non-alcoholic beer.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe intention in drinking the non-alcoholic beer is obviously not to get intoxicated in any way. I have heard that Saudi Arabia allows non-alcoholic beer. However, I have read that there are trace amounts of alcohol. The non-alcholic beer itself say \"less than 0.5% alcohol\" on the bottle, but I have read that the content is usually around 0.2% alcohol. Thank you and peace be with you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari'ah, alcohol is prohibited and impure. It is not\npermissible to drink any beverage having alcohol in it.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
