  "answer": "QUESTION\nI keep finding out new haram ingredients. I research one and find out about others. I've eaten haram stuff or at least may have been, and have made touba over 3 times. One time may have been a pig ingredient, the other is human, other is non halal, other maybe alcohol, etc. In a hadith a person who drinks 4 times and makes touba the last time wont be forgiven and prayer wont count for 40 days. If I ate another thing haram do I make touba? Should I expect to be forgiven? Then another might come.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is compulsory to enquire about the ingredients of edibles being Halaal or Haraam before consuming them. If there is a doubt, then too it is compulsory to abstain from such edibles.\n\nIf you consumed some edibles after thoroughly enquiring about the ingredients being Halaal or Haraam and later come to know that the information was incorrect and the ingredients were Haraam, then you will be excused.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
