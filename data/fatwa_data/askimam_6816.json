  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ: Kindly explain to us the benefits of Verses 26 - 27 of Surah Aale Imraan.%0D%0AA: It is narrated in Tabrani that once Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) did not see Mu?aadh ibn Jabal (Radhiallaahu Anhu) for Jumu?ah. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) went to the house of Mu?aadh and enquired, ?O Mu?aadh! Why didn?t I see you for Jumu?ah?? Mu?aadh replied, ?I was coming for Jumu?ah but I owed a Jew some money and he prevented me from coming for Jumu?ah.? Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?O Mu?aadh! May I not show you a Du?aa that if you have a debt equivalent to a mountain, Allah will discharge it for you.? Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) then showed him verses 26 and 27 of Aale Imraan. It has been said that a person who continues reading these 2 Aayats, Allah will absolve him from debts. These Aayaats should be read 7 times after Fardh Salaat. It is also reported in Tabrani that Hadhrat ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrated that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?In these two Aayats, the Ism-e-Azam of Allah are mentioned through which Du?aas are accepted.?
