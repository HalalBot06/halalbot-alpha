  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nKindly send me the translation of The following hadith: Sahih Muslim No : 338 And a hadith in Muwatta concerning Combining of two salaats.\n\nI know that two salaats cannot be combined as it is against the Quraan but please send me the two ahadith.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe do not know whether you are referring to the same print as ours. Our print is the Dar al-Ma’arifah edition. Hadith 338 of Sahih Muslim translates: Abu Hurayra [radhiallaahu anhu] reports, ‘A few companions approached Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and consulted with him thus, such thoughts cross our minds that we consider it too disastrous to even speak about it. The Prophet [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] then asked, ‘Is that really the case?’ After they replied in the affirmative he [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘This is pure Imaan.’ This refers to Wasaawis that Shaytaan puts into the people’s hearts trying to confuse their beliefs in the oneness of Allah.\n\nAli ibn Husayn [ra] mentioned, Whenever Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] intended a journey by day, he would combine Dhuhr and Asr prayers and when he [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] intended to travel by night, he [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] would combine the Maghrib and Esha prayers. (Muatta Imaam Maalik pg.126; Nur Muhammad)\n\nBecause of the Qur’aanic Aayaat and other clear Hadith texts, this Hadith refers to delaying the Dhuhr to its last time and reading the Asr in its earliest time. Similarly, delaying the Maghrib to its last time and reading the Esha in its earliest time. Outwardly, it looks like combining both the Salaats but in actual fact, it is praying each Salaat in its respective time. (Ielaa-us-sunan)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
