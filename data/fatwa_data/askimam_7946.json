  "question": "If credit issuer has a clause in the agreement where they forgive the owed amount in case of death does that mean we do not have to pay that amount? If so can the same principles be applied to loan?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy brother in law recently died when he went back home for his wedding, he left behind a good amount of credit card debt and loan from government of Canada. We are trying to pay off his debt. If cedit card company can forgive or has a clause in the agreement then does that mean.....we do not have to pay the amount due.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou should clarify this with the government of Canada.\n\nIn Shari?ah, if a person takes a loan and passes away, he is not absolved of his debt. It is necessary to pay it from his estate.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
