However, in order to maintain a harmonious relation, it is wise to talk the first wife into his intention of taking a second wife. Generally, if a man marries a second wife without discussing the issue with his first wife, his life become miserable and that causes a great amount of anxiety, stress and discomfort to the wives and children.\n\nWe agree that if the husband conceals the second marriage, he would fail in fulfilling his obligation of maintaining equality among his wives. According to Shariah, the husband is required to spend equal amount of nights by each of his spouses. Therefore if goes to stay with the second wife every second day, the first wife will become suspicious of him having an illicit relation which could cause more harm than anticipated. At that stage it will be difficult to talk to her as her emotions would overpower her and no sense will prevail.\n\nIt is our understanding that the issue of taking a second wife can never be concealed. The reality will expose itself at some time or the other.\n\nIf the husband cannot maintain two wives, he should not take another wife. He should set his priorities and choose which one he wants. It is prudent to mention that sometimes the husband becomes drunk over his love for the second wife that he ignores the sacrifices borne by the first wife and stoops to the level where he is prepared to separate and divorce her. The situation becomes even more complex when he has children from her. It is therefore important for the husband to consider all these issues before considering taking another wife.\n\nIf the husband is not prepared to expose his second marriage, the second wife should consider that before marrying this man. It is unwise and foolish to marry and thereafter consider the implications of marrying such a person.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n\n\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
