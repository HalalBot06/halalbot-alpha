  "answer": "QUESTION\nplease can you help me i am a 25 yr old girl born a muslim but ashamed to say that i never really practised. i really want to start practising and learning about my religion are there any duas that will strenghten my faith?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThank you for writing to us about your situation.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe are all human and thus err, however now that we have realised our wrong, it is imperative that we get back on the right path. First, for the protection of your Iman (Faith) recite the kalim 100 times every morning and evening. Make sure you keep good company and are punctual with your salah, fasting, zakaat and other responsibilities. It will be necessary for you to make amend for the salah and fasting left out over the years.%0D%0A%0D%0AInstead of over-burdening yourself at the beginning, work out a bearable system eg. For making Qadha of the salaah that you missed, every day with every salah make Qadha of a similar salah or two. Eg. After Fajr make Qadha of Fajr, After Zuhr of Zuhr etc. As for your fasting, set a day in the week eg, monday and keep a qadha fast every monday.%0D%0A%0D%0ABefore starting work out approximately how many you missed and keep a record as you go along of how many you have covered up. It is very important that you start reading a few ahadith and stories of the sahabah daily in our home. Fadhaile Amal is a goodbook to use for this. Adopting hijab is off utter importance, even though it would be very difficult.%0D%0A%0D%0ATry to read stories of the thousands of women in our times who have, by the grace of Allah, changed their lives and adopted hijab. Many groups and websites mention these stories. May Allah Ta'ala give you the ability to be steadfast.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
