  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI enrolled in the Islamic American University to tread on the Noble Path of Islamic Scholarship and inshallah become an Islamic Scholar.\n\nI have some troubling news and I am praying that you will be able to help me inshallah. I live with my parents in our house, currently I sleep in the basement and I have been sleeping in the basement for  two years without any problems. One night I was reading Imam Ghazalli's (RA) famous book Ihya Uloom Al-Deen and I had started to get tired so I prayed the last three Surah's of the Qur`an on Islamicity.com and went to bed.\n\nAbout 3:00am I woke up and someone was sitting in my computer chair and it was staring at the blank computer screen, I got scared when I noticed the figure was transparent I could see right through it....as soon as it crossed my mind it could be a Jinn i had the urge to run upstairs or yell for help...insttead I was scared and I started to pray Al-Falaq and Al-Nas....the Jinn started to turn around to stare at me so I closed my eyes and kept on reciting these verses quietly...when I opened my eyes the Jinn was walking or floating (don't remember) away and it went through a wall. Ever since then we have had problems in our house...something my whole family except my little brother who is 16 years old had to deal with. We need your help...we have prayed the Qur`an in our house many times and we always pray 5 times a day but yet this problem still persists?\n\n \n\nWe are in need of your advice and we pray you will be able to help us.\n\n \n\nSorry about the long letter.\n\n \n\nJazkallah Khair.\n\n \n\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) is reported to have said: \"Scholars are the heirs of Prophets, and Prophets neither left behind dinars nor dirhams (Arab coins); rather they left knowledge. He who acquires knowledge has really gained something of great value.\"\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is very encouraging to note that you are studying Ilm-e-Deen. It is importat for you to reconsider your source of Ilm-e-Deen. A secular university may not be suitable for you to achieve your objective. You should consider relocating to a traditional institute that has Ulama-e-Haqq and seek knowledge from them. There is a vast difference between seeking knowledge of Deen from a secular institute and an Islamic institute. It is stated, ‘Verily, this knowledge is Deen. See where you acquire it from.’ (Mishkaat). The above advice is based on considering your goodness. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Ad-Deen an Naseeha’ Deen is to consider the welfare and goodness of others.\n\nYou have stated that condition of your family. It is our advice that you have the members of your family and the house inspected by a qualified Aalim and follow his advice. If a qualified Aalim cannot be found, then the family should consider moving to another place.\n\nWe make du’aa that Allah guide you and grant you peace and happiness, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
