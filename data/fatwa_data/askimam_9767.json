  "question": "I am sending these questions third time please answer these questions. (Ref # 9495 and 9609) If a person is working as realtor, is his earning is Halal",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nQ 1: If a person is working as realtor, is his earning is Halal (he gets the commission from the selling price of the house and not from the interest even though the person who bought the house financed it and the person who sold the house also financed it when he bought it but the realtor only gets the commission from the actual price of which the house sold). Q 2: If a person worked in a car dealership and sells cars as sales person and a person works as manager of the car sales peoples team, are their earnings Halal? The sales person gets the commission from the car sales price and also from the finance money if the buyers do finance through the dealer. The manager gets the commission from over all sales of the total cars sold and also from the financed money of customers do finance through the dealer. Q 3: If a person is fasting and he goes to sleep during the day time and have a wet dream, how could he do Islam Bath (Ghusel), how far can he gargle and how far should he get the water in the nose in order to validate he ghusel?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There are two aspects to the earnings of a realtor; a) Agency, b) Interest. According to the Shari'ah, the act of agency is permissible and the income is also permissible. However, if the agent is aware that the purchaser will finance the house found by him with interest, in effect, he will be assisting the purchaser to advance his interest bearing deal. That will contaminate the commission of the agent and make it Makrooh.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The ruling of the income of the sales person and manager for a car dealership is similar to the income of a realtor. The sales person and the manager earns a commission for selling the cars, that is permissible, but their income will be contaminated as they assist the purchaser to advance his interest bearing deal through financing.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. It is permissible for a person in the state of Janaabat (impure state) to make Ghusl while fasting. The person should rinse his mouth and nose lightly. The water should not go beyond the throat and beyond the soft part of the nostrils.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
