  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nÂ \n\nCould you please interpret the following dreams ?\n\n1. I saw countless number of black snakes moving around infront of me, then i'm attacked by several of them. However none of them hurt me. I felt scared during the dream (when they were attacking, ) also relieved when last one of them tried to get me.\n\n2. I saw myself standing infront of a mirror (which i recognise because its at my home) and i saw my top half naked with something in black written on it. In the dream i tried to read it but i couldnt, it wasn't the kalimah or anything religious which i could recognise.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe Ask Imam site is reserved for questions relating to Fiqh.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
