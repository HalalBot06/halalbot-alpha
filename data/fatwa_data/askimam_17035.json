  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nLast ramadan i had an accident due to which I was not able to fast for 12 days. until now i have not fasted to compensate those twelve. do i still have time before the coming ramazan to fast. plz reply quickly\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nYou may make qadha (make up) for your missed fasts even now before Ramadan or after Ramadan. It is not necessary that you keep all twelve fasts at once. You may fast according to your convenience. However, the sooner you make up the missed fasts, the better.\n\nWassalam\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
