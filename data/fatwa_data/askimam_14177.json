  "question": "Many brothers said we have done many wrong things because we don't use shahih hadith in our action.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. Many brothers said we have done many wrong things because we don't use shahih hadith in our action. To which extent we can use a dhaif hadith as the based of our action? To which extent Islam allows flexiblity or addition to the normal/previous practice which has occured ?\n\n2. Who is shekh nasrudin Albani ? Is he a reliable ulama? Can we follow his fatwa? Do u have a detail of his biography ?\n\n3. As a general person (not an Alim), do we have to know every dalil of what we are doing?\n\n4. Why the brother in syafii madzhab peforms fajr with qunut, while it is said that nabi shallalaahu 'alaihi wassalam only performs qunut few times in his life ?\n\n5. Can we celebrate the maulid of Nabi shallalaahu 'alaihi wassalam?\n\n6. How should be our attitude towards some brothers who incline towards salafi? Should we argue with them? Should we prevent them from attending their ta'lim?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. It seems the brother in question refer to the non-Muqallids. This is an old argument against the Hanafis. Ignore such criticism and continue what you are doing.\n\n2. Some Ulama have regarded him to be deviated. The best is silence.\n\n3. No, it is not necessary for you to know every daleel.\n\n4. These are based on difference of opinion and interpretation of the texts. They are entitled to their view.\n\n5. No, we don’t find a single narration citing the Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhu] ever celebrating the birth of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam].\n\n6. Your attitude to them should be of polite tolerance. Do not argue with them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
