  "question": "I am fond of growing ornamental trees. Is there anything sinful (in the sense of theft) if I pick up few seeds of a certain tree growing in the university, where I work, and grow them at my home?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI asked a colleague about this and he said it is okay since university is a public place and trees growing there are not a personal property of anyone. Thanks\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is the moral duty of every Muslim to refrain from taking anything that does not belong to him. If one wishes to pick up certain seeds from the university gardens, he should contact the relevant authorities and seek permission for same.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
