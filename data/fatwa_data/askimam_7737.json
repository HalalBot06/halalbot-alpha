  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. I saw myself standing on the top floor of a huge pink house, which was built in the ocean. I was looking out of a big window and could see right to the bottom floor. There was a thick glass separating the house from the ocean and I could see the sea at the bottom of the house against the window. 2. My mum saw herself and me walking on a pathway and on both of our sides was a graveyard. Ahead of us was also a graveyard which was very beautiful. As we were walking along this path, we saw elephant droppings ahead of us and it was getting more obvious that there were elephants ahead of us. We finally came to the elephants who started charging at us and we started to flee.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. May Allah Ta?ala bless you such bounties from His infinite treasures that are beyond our imagination. That truly will be in Jannah which Allah describes as pure streams flowing beneath one?s palace, Aameen. That may be achieved by striving for the pleasure of Allah in this world.\n\n2. May Allah Ta?ala save you and your mother from any misfortunes, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
