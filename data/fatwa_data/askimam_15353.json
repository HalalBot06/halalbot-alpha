  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMufti saheb, plz answer my following after marriage related doubts:-\n\nI know that men should avoid touching their penis with the right hand. Is it understood from this principle that my wife should also avoid touching my penis with her right hand?\nIs it ok for a husband to use his right hand to touch his wife's sex organ?\nIs there any restriction according to shari'ah to have 'intercourse' inside a bathroom/toilet? If not, in your personal opinion, it should be avoided or there is nothing wrong in it?\nCan i suck my wife's sweat after intercourse ( before bath ) and during her periods (from allowed parts)?\nCan i masturbate her during her periods?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe prohibition of touching the private parts with the right hand is regarding istinjaa (washing the private parts after relieving).\nYes.\nIntercourse is a natural demand which should be fulfilled in a modest way.\nNo.\nNo.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
