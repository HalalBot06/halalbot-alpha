  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI just want to ask is imam muhidai alife right now and he will come to kill dajjal? could you plz give us a bit info about it\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\n \n\nNobody knows for sure if Imam Mahdi (A.S) is alive at this very moment. However, there are signs that his coming is close.\n\nRasulullāh Sallallahu ̒alaihi Wa Sallam said:\n\n\"At the approach of Qiyamah knowledge will be uplifted, ignorance will become widespread and Harj (killing) will  become rampant.\"                      (Fath Al Bari Vol.13, Pg.16, Qadimi Kutub Khana)\n\nHāfiz Ibnu Hajar Rahmatullāhi ̒alayhi (died 852 A.H) states under the explanation of the above Hadith and others that \"At the manifestation of Fitan (turmoil, chaos, and corruptions etc.) killing and murder will become rampant then Imām Mahdi (A.S.) will appear and cause peace to prevail. \n(Fath Al Bari Vol.13, Pg.20, Qadimi Kutub Khana) \n\nIt is also known that Imām Mahdi (A.S.) will be the progeny of Rasulullāh Sallallahu ̒alaihi Wa Sallam and his coming is certain. He will also restore justice in the world.\n\nRasulullāh Sallallahu ̒alaihi Wa Sallam has said:\n\n\"If there remain only one day of this world Allāh Ta ̒āla will lengthen that day and send a person from My progeny (who will bring peace to the entire world), his name and his father's name will be the same as My name and My father's name. He will liberate the earth with fairness and justice as it was filled before with injustice and oppression\".     (̒Awn Al-Ma̒bud Vol. 7, Pg. 346, Dār Al-Hadith)\n\nHāfiz Ibnu Katheer Rahmatullāhi ̒alayhi (died 774 A.H) states Imām Mahdi’s name will be the same as Nabi Sallallāhu ̒alayhi Wa Sallam's name -Muhammad- and his father's name will be the same as Nabi Sallallāhu ̒alayhi Wa Sallam's father's name, Abdullah. \n(Tafseer Qurān Al ̒Azem, Vol.2, Pg.34, Dār Al-M̒arifah)\n\nImām Mahdi A.S will be recognized at the Ka'ba and those present will accept him as their leader. However, he will not kill Dajjal; instead Nabi ̒Isa ̒Alaihi as Salām will kill Dajjal.\n\nUmmu Salamah Radi Allah ̒anha reports that Nabi Sallallāhu ̒alayhi Wa Salam is reported to have said;…………. (Imām Mahdi) will arise from Medina fleeing to Makkah. The people of Makkah will then pledge allegiance to him between Hajar Al-Aswad and Maqamu-Ibrahim (and accept him as their leader). At this time an army from Shaam will be sent to attack him but when they will be at Bayda, which is between Makkah and Madina, they will be swallowed into the ground.  \n\nThe people seeing this (the army being swallowed),  they will confirm him as being  their leader; thereafter the Abdāls (those whom Allah Ta'ala will use to uplift his Deen) of Shaam and a group A'saib (people from Iraq) will then approach him and pledge allegiance to him (Imām Mahdi) between Hajar Al-Aswad and Maqamu-Ibrahim. Mean while a person from the Quraysh belonging to the Kalbi tribe will then send an army to attack (Imām Mahdi) and his followers. His (Imām Mahdi's) army will defeat them…. Imām Mahdi will then live among the Muslims for a period of seven years, he will work and establish the sunnah of Nabi (Sallallāhu ̒alayhi Wa Salam) (among mankind) and Islam will again be universal. He will thereafter die and the Muslims will perform his Janāzah.\n(̒Awn Al-Ma'bud Vol. 7, Pg. 350, Dār Al-Hadith)\n\n̒Allāma Shams Al-Haqq Al-Azem Abādi Rahmatullāhi ̒alayhi states in his commentary ̒Awn Al-M'abud that \"At the end of time a person will appear who will belong to the progeny of Nabi (Sallallāhu ̒alayhi Wa Salam) he will assist the Deen of Allah Ta’ala and let justice prevail, the Muslims will accept him as their viceroy and follow his commands, his name will be Mahdi. The appearance of Dajjal and all other signs of Qiyāmah will precede his manifestation, until Isā ̒Alayhi Al-Salām will descend from the heavens, he will then kill Dajjal and Imām Mahdi will assist him.\"\n(̒Awn Al-Ma'bud Vol. 7, Pg. 341, Dār Al-Hadith)\n\n   \n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl.
