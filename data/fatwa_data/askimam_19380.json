I have taken khula from my husband which was done this month. I have been living with my parents for 7 months. Pls tell me if iddat is farz on me and if so, how long?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nIf the husband gives talaaq, or dies, or the woman takes khula from the husband, then Iddat becomes fardh for a woman. Your Iddat will start from the time khula was finalized. Since you are pregnant the iddat will be until the birth of the child. After the birth of the child you will no longer be in iddat. ( Bahishti Zewar, Vol 4. Pg 62 ; Fatawa Hindiya 1/528 )\n\nAgar koi khawand apni biwi ko talaq de, ya faut ho jaye, ya biwi khula le lay, to us aurat par iddat fardh hai. Aap ki iddat khula kay waqt wuqoo se ho gee. Chonkeh aap haamila hain, aap ki iddat hamal ke payda honay tak rahe gi. Bachay ki peydayesh keh saath hi aap ki iddat khatam ho jayegee.\n\n \n\nوَعِدَّةُ الْحَامِلِ أَنْ تَضَعَ حَمْلَهَا\nالفتاوى الهندية ، دار الفكر ، 1/ 528\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Faisal bin Abdul Hameed\nStudent, Darul Iftaa\nCanada\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
