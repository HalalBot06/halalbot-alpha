  "question": "If we visit any Muslim and he offers some food to eat, but we donâ€™t know that the food is halal or not. Can we avoid eating if we have a doubt of halal and haram.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe ruling will depend on the extent of the doubt. If one is almost certain\nthat a certain Muslim does not know the correct concept of Halaal and is not\nsensitive to Halaal and Haraam, then that is a sound reason to abstain from\neating such foods offered by him which is doubtful, for example, meat, etc.\n\nIn such a situation, one should apply his discretion and adopt wisdom and\ndiplomacy in his approach, probably, by eating only the non-meat dish. The\nfriendship may also be used as an opportunity to advise the person of Shari'\nah, Halaal and Haraam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
