  "question": "Any surahs that make you stronger in faith?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs salam aleikum. I am a 14 year old girl from the United States. I?m from a muslim community where nobody cares about religion. The good news is that I pray five times a day and try to do hijab, but the bad news is that nobody else in my family does. They just don?t care. The first time I started wearing a head scarf, they laughed at me and made fun of me. I look at mid-eastern people from my school and I wish I could be them. They actually act like muslims. I have faith in Allah but right now I?m really scared to keep doing hijab because I keep thinking about what my family is going to say. Can you please tell me if there?s any surahs or anything that makes you stronger in faith and how I can ignore all the comments that my family makes about me. Thank you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlhamdulillah Allah has given you the desire to be like those who practice%0D%0AAllah's religion.%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Huzaifah Ra states that when a hardship came upon Nabi Ssallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi wasallam, then immediately he would turn towards Salaat. (abu Dawud)%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah ta'ala states in the Quran: \"O you who believe, seek help through%0D%0Apatience and prayer (salaat)\" [2:153]%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Abdullah bin Abu Aufa Ra has said that the Messenger of Allah S said,%0D%0A\"If anyone wants something from Allah, or from a human being, let him%0D%0Aperform ablution, then offer two rak'ats, then extol Allah and invoke%0D%0Ablessings on the Prophet Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam, then say: \"laa ilaaha%0D%0Aillallah-ul-haleemul kareem subhaanallahi rabbil a'rshil a'zeem walhamdu%0D%0Alillahi rabbil a'alameen, asaluka moojibaata rahmathika wa a'zaaima%0D%0Amaghfirathika wal ghaneematha min kulli birr wassalaamatha min kulli%0D%0Ais'mi-lla-thadaa' li zanban illa ghafarthahu wa la hamman illa farrjthahu wa%0D%0Alaa h'aajathan hiya laka ridh'an illa qadh'aythaha ya arh'am-ar-raah'imeen\"%0D%0A(thuhfa khawateen -A gift for women, page 429%0D%0AAny zikr will make faith stronger. Some zikr which you may recite is as%0D%0Afollows:%0D%0A%0D%0A-'Hasbi yallahu wa ni'mal wakeel'%0D%0A-ayatul kursi%0D%0A-the last ayats [verse 129] of surah taubah from 'hasbiyallau laa ilaaha%0D%0Ailla hu... a'zeem'. The translation of this verse is \"So, if they turn%0D%0Aaway, say, Enough for me is Allah. there is no God but He. in Him I have%0D%0Aplaced my trust, and He is the Lord of the Great Throne.\"%0D%0A%0D%0ACOMMENTARY: The basic responsibility of the prophets is to invite people to%0D%0Athe way of Allah with love, affection, sympathy and an earnest desire for%0D%0Atheir well-being; if they have to face aversion from the people or have to%0D%0Asuffer some hardships, they are supposed to leave it to Allah and place%0D%0Atheir trust in Him, for He is the Lord of the Great Throne. Great merits of%0D%0Athese (last) two vers! es appear in Hadith. Sayyidna Abu-d-Darda R says,%0D%0A'one who recites these verses three times, morning and evening, shall find%0D%0Athat Allah Ta'ala makes things easy for him. (Qurtubi) [Ma'ariful Quran%0D%0Avol.4 by Moulana mufti Muhammad Shafi]%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi Sallallahu Alayhi wasallam has said that the following seven people%0D%0Awill be accommodated by Allah in the shade of His Mercy on the Day when%0D%0Athere will be no other shade except His: 1) A just ruler 2) one who is young%0D%0Aand worships Allah in his youth 3) A person whose heart yearns for the%0D%0AMasjid 4) Those two persons who love, meet and depart only for the pleasure%0D%0Aof Allah 5) A man who is tempted by a beautiful woman and refuses to respond%0D%0Aofr fear of Allah, 6) a person who gives alms so secretly that the charity%0D%0Aof one hand is not known to the other hand 7) A person who practises Zikr of%0D%0AAllah in solitude, so that tears flow of his eyes.\" (Bukhari and Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore we should be like the one who is young and worships Allah in his%0D%0Ayouth.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
