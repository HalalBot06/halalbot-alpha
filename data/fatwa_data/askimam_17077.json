  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI wanted to per rom  the quada som -o- sallath of life time, but I dont know from what date I calculate, so please help me in this regard, from which age  we should consider our self balig, please mention the age for males and females from which one became balig.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n Assalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nA male is regarded to be Baligh (adult) in Shariah from the time he experiences wet drean, In the case of a female, she will be baaligh from the time she experiences menses.\n\nIf a male or a female does not experience physical maturity or menses before the age of 15, Shariah will declare the person to be adult from the age of 15. As such the person is obliged to follow all the laws of Shariah that are directed to him or her. You should calculate your missed Salaah according to the above explained principle.\n\n \nWassalam\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
