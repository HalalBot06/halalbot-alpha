  "question": "Is it permissible to open a subway?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have 2 brothers and we are all working together in the US since we arrived with my parents. We used to own a gas station which sold haram things and we moved to a different type of business which is import and export, but as the economy is now suffering really bad, money is very tight now and we do not make enough money to even pay the house payment, let alone food and other bills for almost 3 years now.\n\nWe have been looking for a long time for a halal business but we are unable to find anything. We are thinking about opening a restaurant such as subway, but we know that it sells pork. I would like to know if it is permissible or not since these restaurants require the sale of all their products and I cannot refuse to sell pork? Jazzakallah Khair.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\n \n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\nIt is not permissible to sell pork.[1] You should live a simple lifestyle which does not demand a high income. Adopt a lifestyle which would best allow you to repay all your debts. If you are experiencing financial difficulties then you should consider making adjustments in your standard of living and downscale your expenses. All you require is courage and determination.\n\nAllah Ta’ālā says,\n\n{وَمَنْ يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَلْ لَهُ مَخْرَجًا}\n\n“And whosoever fears God, He shall make for him a way (out of every difficulty).”\n\nQuran 65:2\n\n \n\nConstantly make the following Dua for ease in sustenance,\n\nاللَّهُمَّ اكْفِنِي بِحَلاَلِكَ عَنْ حَرَامِكَ، وَأَغْنِنِي بِفَضْلِكَ عَمَّنْ سِوَاكَ\n\nAlhummakfini bi halālika ‘an harāmik wa aghnini bi fadhlika ‘aman siwāk\n\n“Oh Allah suffice me with that which you have permitted abstaining from that which you have forbidden and make me independent of all those besides you.”\n\n(Tirmizi vol.5 pg.452; Dar algharb alislami)\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Ali bin Cassim\nStudent Darul Iftaa\nLos Angeles, CA (USA)\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[1] قال: (وبيع الميتة والدم والخمر والخنزير والحر وأم الولد والمدبر، والجمع بين حر وعبد، وميتة وذكية باطل) أما الميتة والدم والحر فلأنها ليست بمال (الاختيار لتعليل المختار ج2 ص 23،مطبعة الحلبي)"
