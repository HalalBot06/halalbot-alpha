  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. I have heard a hadith wherein it is mentioned that Hadrat Ali [ra] missed his asr salah because Nabi [saw] was sleeping on his lap. He began to cry and on awakening the Nabi [saw] brought back the sun so that Hazrat Ali could read his asr. Is this authentic?\n2. What has Imam Ahmad Raza mentioned that is shirk? Did Moulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi consider him [Imam Ahmad Raza] to have been a great aalim?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1. The Hadith is as follows:\n\nAsma Binte Umais narrates: “Revelation was sent to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) while his blessed head rested on the lap of Ali (radiyallaahu anhu). The sun had set and Ali (radiyallaahu anhu) did not perform his Asr salaat. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to Ali (radiyallaahu anhu): Did you perform Asr salaat? He replied: No! TheProphet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: O Allah, verily Ali was in your obedience and the obedience of your Messenger, so return the sun for him. Asmaa Binte Umais says: I saw the sun set, then raise after setting.”\n\nThe above Hadith is established and has some basis as explained by a group of Muhadditheen including Imaam Tahawi, Allamah Suyuti and Qurtaaji. (Al- la’ali al-Masnoo’h, vol 1, pg 308, Ilmiyya) / Tanzeeh Al-Sharee’h, vol 1, pg 378, Ilmiyya)\n\n2. We do not have the books of Ahmad Raza Khan available to us to know whether he mentioned anything that was Shirk. However, Allamah Sa’eed Ahmad Qadri states in his book Ahle Sunna wa Ahle Bid’a Ki Pehchaan:\n\n“Mawlana Ahmad Raza Khan has documented in his Fatawaa Razviah:\n\n‘One maintaining the doctrine of trinity is not a polytheist (mushrik)”. (Fatawaa Razviah,vol 1, pg 738)\n\nThe above mentioned fatwa is against the following verse:\n\nلقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ ثَالِثُ ثَلَاثَةٍ\n\n“Surely, disbelievers are those who said: Allah is the third of the three”\n\n3. We have no knowledge of Mawlana Ashraf Ali Thaanwi considering Mawlana Ahmad Raza Khan as a great Aalim. However, we have information that Mawlana Ahmad Raza Khan considered Mawlana Ashraf Ali Thaanwi as Kaafir. (Fatawaa Raheemiyya, vol 2, pg 50, Ishaa’t – ref to Tajaanib Ahlis Sunna, pg 237)\n\nصرح جماعة من الأئمةوالحفاظ بأنه صحيح قال القاضي عياض في الشفاء أخرج الطحاوي في مشكل الحديث عن أسماء بنت عميس من طريقين أن النبي صلى اللّه عليه وسلم كان يوحى إليه ورأسه في حجر علي فذكر هذا الحديث. قال الطحاوي وهذان الحديثان ثابتان ورواتهما ثقات وحكى الطحاوي أن أحمد بن صالح كان يقول لا ينبغي لمن سبيله العلم التخلف عن حفظ حديث أسماء لأنه من علامات النبوة انتهى ما في الشفاء.(اللآلي المصنوعة)\n\nثم الحديث صرح بتصحيحه جماعة من الأئمة والحفاظ منهم الطحاوى وللسيوطى جزء فى تتبع طرق هذا الحديث(تنزيه الشريعة)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
