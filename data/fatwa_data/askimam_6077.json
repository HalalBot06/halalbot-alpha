  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it permissible for a married couple to refer to sexually related books available in local bookstores in order to enhance their physical/intimate form of marriage. Books that are written either by doctors. Your kind advise is requested.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is a fundamental difference between Islamic values and western%0D%0Aconcepts. Many things prohibited in Islam is regarded as taboo in the%0D%0Awestern world, especially, in physical %2F intimate relationship.%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Shame is a branch of Imaan.'%0D%0A(Mishkaat) In another narration, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Asaid, 'When there is no shame, a person may do whatever he%2Fshe wish to.'%0D%0A(Ibid).%0D%0A%0D%0AAs Muslims, we are advised to display shame and modesty in every aspect of%0D%0Aour lives. That includes physical%2Fintimate relationship with one's spouse.%0D%0AIt is obvious that sexually related books authored by non-Muslims are void%0D%0Aof any shame. In fact, many of their guidelines lead to unnatural (pervert)%0D%0Asexual acts. People addicted to such unnatural acts find themselves trapped%0D%0Ain a world of unfulfilled passion as the blazing fire of desires is always%0D%0Aaggravated in them by such resource material. However, if there is a medical%0D%0Areason for not being able to fulfil one's desires, then one may seek medical%0D%0Aadvise to cure oneself. Furthermore, intimacy with one's spouse is a%0D%0Atemporary biological need to be fulfilled, not to be aggravated.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
