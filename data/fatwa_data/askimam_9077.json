  "question": "I am having a life insurance policy from a govt company only to save income tax.In my policy no intrest is involved. Is it allowed. If it isn't then how should one prevent unislamic income tax.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIncome tax is payable to government and life insurance is from government.My policy's name is money back in which they will return my deposited amount and after the policy ends they would give me some bonus which is not fixed and depends upon company's bussiness. Thus no intrest is involved.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSince your intention is to reduce your income tax burden and no interest is allowed, you may take out this particular policy as a ?savings scheme?. As far as you are concerned, let them call it what they wish.\n\nOnce the policy matures at the end of the period, you may take back what you invested and also the bonus ? this will be as a gift from the government.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
