  "answer": "QUESTION\nQuestion asked on behalf of someone that requested I do research On \"sunni's\",salami,rasool being omnipresent.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are a number of issues that you have raised in your questions, a) Allah is Omnipresent, b) Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is alive in his grave, c) Sunnis salami, d) Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) being Omnipresent.%0D%0A%0D%0AHereunder are the answers to your queries in sequence.%0D%0A%0D%0A1. It is the belief of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaa that Allah Ta?ala is Omnipresent. %0D%0A%0D%0A2. Refer Fadhaail-e-Salaat alan-Nabiy (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)) by Shaykh Zakariyyah (RA) pgs.27, 57%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Salaat and Salaam upon our beloved Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is indeed meritorious and every believer is duty bound to send Durood unto our beloved Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). However, the procedure and Aqeedah (belief) that is adopted when carrying out this noble act should also be in total conformity with the teachings of Shari?ah. It is our Aqeedah that our Durood is conveyed to Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) does not attend these gatherings. As regards the procedure, Salaat and Salam may be conveyed in any way, either standing, sitting, lying down, etc. It should not be regarded as necessary that one must do this action in a standing position. Also, this is a totally voluntary act which should not be forced upon anybody nor regarded as necessary.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is not Omnipresent. This is an exclusive quality of Allah Ta?ala.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
