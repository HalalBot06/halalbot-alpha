  "question": "Is a person's income pre-determined by Allah (SW)? Is it haram to work for an insurance company? How do I overcome my fear of becoming poor or financially insecure?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI feel insecure all the time about my life and the way it's progressing especially when it comes to financial issues. So, I was looking for a job and I came across an insurance company, which has a good job offer. Is it haram for me to work there? How do I overcome my fear of becoming poor or not earning enough money in the future? I only want to work in something that is halal, but it seems like there is nothing available. Is a person's income pre-determined by Allah (SW)?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. A person?s income is predestined by Allah Ta?ala but this does not mean that must be lax in pursuing a Halaal livelihood. Man is compelled to earn a Halaal livelihood.\n\n2. It is Haraam for you to work in an insurance company.\n\n3. Search for Halaal livelihood. Halaal is available even though it may seem insufficient or you may have to work harder for it.\n\n4. Recite Surah Waaqi?ah (in the 27th Juz) every night. Allah will protect you from poverty.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
