  "answer": "QUESTION\n\"ya katheeral khairi wa ya da imil ma'ruf.\"\n \nI heard that this dua was taught to Yakub (as) by Jibrail alahis salam and is good for the protection of children.\n \n2. My sister and her husband used go to tabligh. Actually they were the forerunner to introduce tabligh to the family, and friends. Few years ago, they came to contact with salafis and started following the salafi madhab. They still like tabligh but don't go due to daily life busyness. If I tell them to come back to hanafee madhab again, they listen to me carefully but don't act on it.\n \nWhat can I do for them? Is it very terrifying that they left hanafi madhab and became salafi? \n \nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Unfortunately, we were unable to locate this du’aa. However, Imaam ibn Abi Haatim al-Raazi [ra] has quoted a narration in which there is mention of Ya’coob [alayhis salaam] reciting the following du’aa when he sent Yoosuf [alayhis salaam] with his brothers, ‘Allahumma saafih hum bi yameenir rahmah.’ (O Allah, Greet them with your mercy.’ (Tafseer ibn Abi Haatim vol.7 pg.2107)\n\n2. What makes you believe that they follow the Salafi Madhab and do not follow the Hanafi Madhab? What do they believe and/or do that is against the Hanafi Madhab.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
