And is it a sufi type book?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe book, ‘Dalaailul Khayraat’ is a book in which the author (Shaykh Abu Abdillah Muhammad ibn Sulaiman ibn Abi Bakr al-Jazuli [ra]) has compiled the various different forms of Durood (sending salutations upon Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]).\n\nThe author of ‘Kashfuz-zunoon’ (Hafiz Khalifah [ra]) has praised this compilation.
