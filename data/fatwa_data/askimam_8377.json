  "answer": "QUESTION\npls can u clarify a few thing. i have been praying for about 5 months now and am starting to encounter, extreme waswaas. these thoughts are no nasty and bad about islam, that it worries me and makes me sad and anrgy. i feel i am deliberately bringing these thoughts in my mind and thus feel sinful. 1) pls can u tell me if all this is a trick of the shaytaan or am i sinning, 2) pls can u tell tell me if i will be punished for having these thoughts or to ponder over them, although i try my hardest to ignore they still come back, i am worried?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWasaawis or the evil thoughts that come to mind should not distress you in this manner. Whenever you are confronted with this, recite Ta?awwudh (A?oodhu billaahi minash shaytaanir rajeem). Such evil thoughts are bound to occur more frequently in Salaat because you are now closer to Allah and Shaytaan is trying his level best to distract you at this time. When this happens in Salaat, just ignore it. Don?t even think about how to repel these thoughts. Ponder over the Salaat and the verses of the Qur?aan recited in Salaat instead.%0D%0A%0D%0A1. You will not be sinning if these thoughts come without you intentionally bringing them up. As mentioned, ignore them altogether.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Together with ignoring them, don?t even think about how you can ward them off. Focus on the Salaat itself.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. The fact that you are concerned about such evil thoughts is an indication that you do have true faith. A person who does not have true faith does not even bother about it. So, take heart and don?t let this disturb you.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Kadwa%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
