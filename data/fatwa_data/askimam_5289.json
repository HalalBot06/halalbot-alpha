She is in her last year of school -So far I still feel that I will wait for this girl -any opinions or duas for me that could help me get through this wait without making gunnah??\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised never to delay Nikah once a match is found. The wisdom behind this is quite clear, i.e. to close the doors of temptation and sin. If you feel that she is a suitable partner, you should make all haste towards Nikah, even though you may not, immediately, be able to live together.\n\nThis is the wisest and safest course to adopt. May Allah Ta?ala ease your matter and fulfil your wishes.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
