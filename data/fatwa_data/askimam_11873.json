  "question": "In Islam anal sex and oral sex is allowed by doing this nikah remains valid or break. I am doing anal sex also she dosen't have any problem.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy Name is Saeed Adun. I want to know that in Islam anal sex and oral sex is allowed or not and by doing this nikah remains valid or break. I am doing both with my wife and she dosen't have any problem with it. I think this is the best way of family planning instead of using condoms. So many people are saying this breaks nikkah. Some are saying by using condom you can do anal sex and oral sex by this way it is allowed. But I read so many places that if both are agree than every thing allowed. People are confusing me so please tell me what to do.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAnal sex is a grave sin and is completely forbidden, regardless of whether the wife agrees to it or not. Oral sex is also forbidden.\n\nDoing it does not break the nikah, but you should immediately abstain from it and make taubah. The futile excuse of it being better than a contraceptive doesn't carry any weigh. If you are justified in using a contraceptive, then there are many different options on the market which could be adopted, instead of this hideous practice will draws the anger of Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
