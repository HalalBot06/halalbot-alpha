  "question": "if one reveals his own or any one elses sin, then his sins will be broadcasted on the Day Of Judgement in front of everyone, and if one conceals his own sin or conceals anothers sin, then Allah SWT will take his servant to a side and take his hisaab in private.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nregarding a hadeeth I have read in Fazaail-e-A'maal. To the nearest effect the hadeeth says that if one reveals his own or any one elses sin, then his sins will be broadcasted on the Day Of Judgement in front of everyone, and if one conceals his own sin or conceals anothers sin, then Allah SWT will take his servant to a side and take his hisaab in private.\n \nI am aware that it is incorrect to reveal sins, but what I wanted to know was that if one is faced with a situation and is need of advice from the Ulama-e-kiram, can he reveal his sin to elaborate his situation. By doing this the Aalim will have a better understanding of the problem and the advice he gives may become more specific to that particular situation. Is this permissible?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is permissible for one to reveal one’s sins to the Ulama with the intention of getting advice and reforming oneself.\n\n \n\n \n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
