  "question": "Is ethanol alcohol from other than grapes and dates permissible in foods and sweets?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nEthanol alcohol in foods and sweets. In one of your answers you said that coke had alcohol and it was halal because it did not come from dates or grapes. Is it then true to say if the same kind of alcohol is found in sweets or in food is it still permissible to eat the food?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nYes, but with certain conditions. Please see our detailed article which outlines the conditions of consuming foods and drinks that contain this type of alcohol #31176 \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
