  "question": "About Haram Earnings",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamaliakum mufti sahib, I have heard that a person who eats from food which is haram, i.e. earned through bad practices such as selling alcohol, he can never be a mustajabatdawa (one who?s dua?s are never accepted because of haram earnings). If this is the case, than what about the children who also eat from food purchased by haram money e.g. I am 19 and live with my parents. They have a halal Indian restaurant, which also sells alcohol. Does this mean that I can not be a mustajabatdawa as I do not have a say as to where their money comes from and by what means. If telling the parent that it is a very bad and wrong practice, and yet they still do it, what can be done. Children can not simply move out of the house, as they will have no means of earning money. I will grateful if you can help. Jazakallah for your help and may Allah bless you and your work.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMay Allah Ta'ala increase the level of your Imaan, Aameen. The income from the sales of Halaal food is Halaal. The income from the sales of alcohol is Haraam. If the income of the food is more than income of alcohol, then it will be taken that your consumption is from Halaal means. If the income of alcohol is more, then too it will be taken that your consumption is from Halaal. In any case, due to your situation, that does not effect your spirituality and possibility of becoming a Mustajaabud-Da' awaat. You should apply wisdom and diplomacy in explaining the importance of Halaal income to your parents with a motivation to stop the sales of alcohol at the food outlet. and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
