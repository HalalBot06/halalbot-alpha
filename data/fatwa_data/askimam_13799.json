  "question": "A woman used to bleed for three or four days every month. Thereafter, in a particular month she bled for more than her normal period but not more than ten days. All the days that she bled will be haid.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\njazakoumoullahu khairan for the answer u have provided about my menses question (about 7 days red discharge and 22 days yellow discharge)...\n\ni just wanted to ask, does this also apply if around 6 months ago, my menses used to be less than 10 days?....because my menses haven't always been like that since i got them. Before, i only used to get red discharge for 7 days and no yellow discharge at all...i only recently started having yellow discharge for almost the whole month....\n\nin bahishti zewar it says:\n\nA woman used to bleed for three or four days every month. Thereafter, in a particular month she bled for more than her normal period but not more than ten days. All the days that she bled will be haid. But if she bled for more than ten days, then all the days which are more than her normal period will be regarded as istihaada. For example, a woman always had a habit of bleeding for three days. However, in a particular month she bled for nine days or ten days and ten nights. All these days will be regarded as haid. But if she bled for even a moment more than ten days and ten nights, then her first three days are haid and the balance of the days will be regarded as istihaada. It will be wajib for her to make qada of her salaat for the balance of these days.\n\nso does this affect my situation in any Â way since in the past, my period used to be for 7 days only?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn principle, if the cycle has changed, then the ruling will also change. The previous cycle will be regarded as changed after one change. This is your situation. Your cycle has changed and has remained like that for a long time. It could change again.\n\nThe ruling in Bahishti Zewar is in the context of one odd cycle between two normal cycles.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
