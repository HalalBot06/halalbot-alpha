  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIn referrence to your Fatwa 15777 i am confused. Are you saying that solar power is permissible only in the conditions stated or are your saying that it is not permissible in those conditions.\n\nCondition 1 states if it is in a Hot country, please explain what this means. Hot to who\n\nCondition 2 Again hot to who?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is makrooh tanzeehi to use water for wudhu or ghusl if ALL of the conditions are found.  If one of the conditions is not found, then it will not be makrooh tanzeehi.\n\nAs mentioned before, this is due to medical reasons.   Therefore, in classifying a country as hot or a day as hot the view of the professionals in that field will be taken into consideration, as they would know best when water heated directly by the sun becomes harmful.\n\nAgain, this karahah (disliking) is when the water is put directly in the sun and heated.  Solar-powered water heaters in today’s time are not operated in this manner,  therefore it will not be makrooh.\n\nWe request if you can please provide us with scientific research on this matter as requested in the previous reply.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
