  "question": "asl i would like to ask about the ruling of shaving by the private parts and how long must that hair be for the namaaz to be invalid.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ: What is the area of shaving the pubic hair for a male and female?\nA: The area immediately under the navel is not to be shaven. The area of shaving for a person (male / female) is above and around the private parts. If possible, it is commendable to shave around the hind private parts as well. (Al-Kaamil, commentary of Muslim; Imaam Nawawi vol. 1 pg. 128).\n\nIt is Makrooh to leave one?s pubic hair for more than 40 days. The word, ?Makrooh? literally means disliked and it is a degree of impermissibility.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
