It seems that he may leave you and cause ruin to your life. We suggest you sever relations with him immediately. Our humble opinion is that you contact the responsible people of your family and request them about about the second boy with regards to marriage.\n\nIt is not necessary to inform him about the past. Make Tawbah and seek repentance from Allah for the past.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
