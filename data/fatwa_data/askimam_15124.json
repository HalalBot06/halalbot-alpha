  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy father passed away 24 yrs ago. Estate wounded up, value  r200 000. Uncle was in charge of distribution. Estate not distributed. Uncle says that he borrowed the money.\n\nIs the value of the money today the same as in 1983? If not, how do you calculate the value? \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf the husband borrowed R200, 000 is 1983. He has to pay back the same amount today. The inflation rate from 1983 will not be added on the amount of R200, 000.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
