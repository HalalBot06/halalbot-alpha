  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalmu-alaikum,\n\nA friend has turned to me for advice. His father has committed adultery about more than 20 years ago and it is still going on. He has told me his father has had an affair with his mothers own sister. He has 2 children from her. Also my friend they are four children and have been living their life like this for years. He says his family at times is neglected and his mother does not see eye to eye with his father. No-one has done or said anything, he says people think his aunt is his fathers wife and sometimes she tells people that he is her child. Is their anything that can be done, as he says people have accepted them like this. He says he cannot bare the pain his mother has gone through for years.\n\nPlease advise.\n\nWasalaam  \n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nYour friends father has committed adultery with his aunt. Furthermore he could not marry her as marriage with ones aunt is prohibited. The children from her will be illegitimate.\n\nYour friends mother may continue making sabr and hope for the reward from Allah. If she does not want to continue the marriage, she may contact her local Ulama, the Jamiats in Natal, Gauteng or MJC in Cape Town for an annulment of her marriage. The judicial body of the Ulama will consider the application in the light of Shariah and advise accordingly.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nThe ask imam site will not process questions from October 23 till October 27. You may forward your observations about the site.\n\n \n\nContact the Imam of Croydon Masjid and Islamic Centre for all the talks of Mufti Ebrahim Desai conducted through radio Ramadhan Croydon and Croydon Masjid and Islamic Centre 525 London road, Thornton Heath Croydon, Surry, CR7 6AR\n\n \n\nHappy Eid Mubarak to you\n\n \n\nMay Allah accept your ibadat in Ramadhan and grant us all His pleasure and Jannah (Aameen)"
