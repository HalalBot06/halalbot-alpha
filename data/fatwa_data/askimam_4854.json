  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaams, could you please clarify for me what exactly is taqwa, how does one aquire taqwa, and what are the benefits/rewards if one does have taqwa in his/her life?? Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMoulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi (RA) said that the Haqeeqat (reality) of Taqwa is%0D%0Afor Tayaqquz (alertness) to be created in all facets of life. This means%0D%0Athat one should ponder upon every step whether this is for Allah or for the%0D%0ANafs or how much is for Allah and how much is for the Nafs.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) asked Hadhrat Ka'b Ahbaar (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhu), 'What is the reality of Taqwa?' He said, 'Have you ever passed a%0D%0Athorny tree?' He answered, 'Yes'. He asked, 'How did you pass?' He answered,%0D%0A'I passed with such care that I ensured that no thorn got caught into my%0D%0Ahem.' He said, 'In the very same way, the reality of Taqwa is for one to%0D%0Asave himself from the thorns of sins and negligence. The companionship of%0D%0Athe pious plays a vital role for inculcating Taqwa. Alhamdulillah, with the%0D%0Aeffort of Tabligh, such sincere servants are present who reminds one of the%0D%0AAakhirat and removes negligence from the heart. Hence, remain steadfast on%0D%0Athe teachings and Mashwara of the elders and constantly spend time in the%0D%0Apath of Allah through which, Insha Allah, Allah will bless one with this%0D%0Agreat quality of Taqwa.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
