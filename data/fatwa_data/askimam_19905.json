  "question": "Can I pray for a non- muslim girl for guidance?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan you please let me know if we can pray for a non- Muslim girl who believes one God for guidance and also to make her pious.\n\nCan we pray to Allah for making a non- Muslim to be guided with pious qualities and also to marry her.\n\nCan we beg with Allah for the guidance with crying.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu `alaykumwa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nIn principle, it is permissible for one to pray for the guidance (Hidayat) of non- muslims.\n\nIt is not permissible for one to seek forgiveness on behalf of non- Muslims.[1]\n\nPraying for a non- Muslim girl will fall under the purview of the aforementioned principle provided that it does not entail the violation of the dictates of Shariah in all forms.\n\nIf there is a fear of Fitnah by engaging in making Du’aa for the girl, then it should be left out totally.\n\nEvery deed has an underlying motive and cause by which a person is motivated.\n\nThe underlying and hidden motives behind the case in reference is questionable.\n\nWe should always check the underlying motives behind any deed. What is the underlying motive for doing such an act? Is it promoted by Nafsaaniyyat or is it promoted by the Love and Pleasure of Allah (Ta’ala)\n\nWhy would a person choose to pray for a non- Muslim girl from the many billions of non- Muslims out there in the World.\n\nThe Awliyaa e Kiraam (Pious friends of Allah) have stated that “Shaytaan comes to deceive a person in ninety nine garbs of righteousness”\n\nShaytaan has manipulated the Nafs (lower carnal self) to engage in Haraam thoughts and casting lustful glances at the non- Muslim girl through the ploy of praying for her.\n\nShaytaan very cleverly sugar coats evil and Haraam through good deeds. One should be very cautious and alert in this regard. Always be aware of the deceptive ploys and plots of Shaytaan.\n\nYou may have had a sincere intention at the beginning, but the plan of Shaytaan is to slowly ensnare and entrap you in the clutches of Nafsaaniyyat and Haraam.\n\nWe advise one to immediately clear one’s mind of the non- Muslim girl and focus one’s attention to the source and creator of all love, which is Allah (Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala).\n\nWe also advise one to attend the discourses of the Ahlullah (friends of Allah) so that the love of Allah (Ta’ala) is created within one’s heart.\n\nAnd Allah knows best.\n\nIsmail Desai\nDurban, South Africa\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved \nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDaaruliftaa.net\n\n\n\n\n        1\n\nو الحق حرمة الدعاء بالمغفرة للكافر لا لكل المؤمنين كل ذنوبهم ( ج 1، ص 522- 523، تنوير الابصار و جامع البحار، ايج ايم سعيد)"
