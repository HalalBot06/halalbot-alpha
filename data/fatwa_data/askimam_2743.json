  "question": "What are the obligations of the 'ebaad? Do we admonish & then ostracize?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI know of a situation where a Muslim brother's wife had committed adultery - they were on the verge of divorce but decided to give their marriage another chance. My understanding is that its not enough for me to just tell the woman what she did is haraam but I must also cut any ties with this couple even though the woman repented and regrets what she did. Isn't it so that the Jews were condemned by Allah because the righteous admonished the commonfolk against their misdeeds but still socialised with them. Do I have the correct understanding? What are my obligations in this situation?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nThere are two aspects here:\nOne is I'elaam (to inform) and the other is I'emaal (to make others\npractice). Informing is merely a means of making others practice. The\npurpose (to make others practice) should be placed first and then wisdom\nshould be applied in trying to achieve the purpose.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
