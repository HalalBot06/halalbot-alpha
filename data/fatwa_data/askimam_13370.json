  "question": "I want to know if we can do zikr of Allah by just saying his names from among his 99 names?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n I want to know if we can do zikr of Allah by just saying his names from among his 99 names?\nI mean can we just go on repeating rahman, for eg.\n Some one told me its wrong.You should say something along with His name, not just keep repeating His name.For eg if a child just keeps on saying mummy , mummy..the child's mother wont know why the child is crying out her name? Please clarify my doubt. Most of the time i do zikr by just saying Allah's names.\nThank you\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is permissible to make the Dhikr of Allah by reciting His name or any one of His attributes repeatedly.\n\nThe analogy of the child crying out ‘Mummy’ is not correct. The mother is not Aalimul ghayb (knower of the unseen) whereas Allah is the knower of that which is concealed in the hearts. When a person is engaged in the Dhikr of Allah, Allah will fulfil the needs of the Dhaakir according to His infinite wisdom even without the Dhaakir asking Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
