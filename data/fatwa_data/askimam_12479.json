  "question": "I read that the word 'InshaAllah' should not be used while making Dua. Can you please explain to me what this means?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)With reference to Q. 12284, would it be ok if someone tries to understand Quran or Hadith by reading commentaries because those do explain the respective Verses or Ahadith and even then if he doesn't understand something then he asks an online Q&A service like yours? Otherwise, I think people would become a bit lazy by thinking that they are not qualified to study Quran and Hadith so they would not study it. 2)In one of the articles titled 'Etiquettes of Dua' by Maulana Khalid Dhorat, I read that the word 'InshaAllah' should not be used while making Dua. Can you please explain to me what this means? 3)In Fadhail e Aimaal, Vol. 2, Fadhail e Haj, Pg. 289 (book in Urdu, publisher: Islamic Book Service, New Delhi) near the end of the book where there are given 70 stories about people who went for Haj, it is written that Shah Waliullah (RA) asked Rasoolullah(SAWS) something spiritually, and he got its answer spiritually too. It was something about seeking means or not (Asbab). Can you please explain me how did he ask Rasoolullah(SAWS) 'spiritually'? We know that Rasoolullah(SAWS) is resting in his grave in Madina and he is not 'Hazir Nazir' which is an aqeeda of the Barelvis. Then what does this mean? JazakAllah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The better option would be to do so under the direction auspices of a qualified practicing Aalim. Obviously, where such Ulama are not found, one could also employ the method that you have suggested.\n\n2. In du?aa, one needs to have the conviction that Almighty Allah has definitely accepted it. By uttering the words, Insha Allah, that total conviction is removed.\n\n3. We are unaware of the exact details, however, it seems like Shah Waliyyullaahj [ra] was inspired spiritually while sitting in the Musjidun-nabawiy in Madinah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH SCIENCES\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
