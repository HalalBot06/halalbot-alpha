  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1)\n\nFor NAZAR most of us are used to take 7 black peeper and then 7 times WARNA(URDU WORD) on the person and then burn those. IS it allowed in ISLAM ? What is the DUA for NAZAR as I heard is first 3 QUL Sharif (Surah Qafeeron, Surah Ikhlas, Surah Falaq ) and Ayattul Qursi and blow it on someone for NAZAR. Is it right? If there is something else which Hazarat Muhammad (PBUH) used to read let me know thanks.\n\n2)\n\nCan i take my son picture and send to parents to Pakistan as I am living in UK and my brother and sister have not seen my son and they ask me to send photos to see him because its not easy to go to Pakistan and to them to come to UK ? Obviously they miss so much and I miss them so much as well and want to see each other in which the photo is the only way? Is it still GUNAH ? If it is GUNAH then what shal we do ? So it mean we cannot see each other until we visit pakistan or they visit to uk ? It is so hard like without watching each other u know specially with my baby. They havent seen him directly yet.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum warahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n \n\n1.         You may recite the Surahs that you have written. However, you may include the last few verses of Surah Baqarah as well starting from “Aamanarasoolu” till the end of the Surah. The burning of the chillies or black pepper has proved to be beneficial by some people. It is correct to do these Amals on condition they are not regarded to be established from Deen.\n\n2.         It is not permissible to take the picture of your child and send it over to your family as it is haram (prohibited) to take pictures of animate objects. Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه و سلّم ) has cursed people who take pictures of animate objects.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
