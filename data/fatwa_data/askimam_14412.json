  "question": "do I have to make up for the prayers I might have been praying too early? (without being sure of that) If yes, shall I also make up for the 2 sunnah rakaat for each prayer?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI live in the UK and in May-June I prayed salat-ul-Fajr at 2:30 a.m.. I was using a timetable which stated that the start of Fajr was at 2:25 and the sunrise at 4:45. However, after doing some research and comparing with other timetables available to me, I believe that I have been praying salat-ul-fajr too early during these two months. (The timetable I was following might be wrong as it might be based on the \"false dawn\", but I cannot be sure of that)\n\nMy question is, do I have to make up for the prayers I might have been praying too early? (without being sure of that) If yes, shall I also make up for the 2 sunnah rakaat for each prayer?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYou should contact Hadhrat Mufti Ismail Kaccholvi Saheb at of 71 Fairbank Road, Girlington, Bradford BD8 9JU Telefax: 01274-822538\n\nHe is a very senior Mufti and a great spiritual guide.
