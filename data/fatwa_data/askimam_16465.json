  "question": "Dawat & Tablig - Is it Fardh?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni've spent some time in the work of  ' Dawat & Tablig ' (i think u know about it) and even now i'm with it. it is often told here that, as a Ummat of Rasulullah (SAW) it is mandatory for us to do this work .but i want to know is it mandatory or just a good thing to do ?\n \n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is Fardh Ain (mandatory) for every individual to acquire knowledge in Deen and it is Fardh Kifayah for a group of individuals to propagate the Deen by prohibiting evil and enjoining good. (Fatawa Mahmoodiyah, vol. 4 pg. 203& 208, Jamiah Farooqiyah) By some individuals carrying out this noble task, the remainder of the Ummah will be absolved from the responsibility; however, they will also be deprived of the vast rewards.\n\nThe efforts and methods of the Tableegh Jama’ah have proven to be very successful. No other group or organization has produced such remarkable results in the field of spiritual reformation of the general Muslim masses. The principles and methods of the Tableegh Jama’ah are simple but effective. Their efforts do not contradict any tenet of Islam; therefore, it is highly recommendable for every person to take part in this praiseworthy effort.  However, it is not mandatory to adopt any specific method to fulfill these obligations.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
