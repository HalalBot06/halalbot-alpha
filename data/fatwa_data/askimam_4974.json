  "question": "What is the Sharâ€™ee ruling on wearing wedding gowns by the bride on the day of her wedding?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said that the Nikah which has the most amount of blessings is the one in which the least amount of expenses are incurred. (Mishkaat pg.268; Qadeemi)\n\nNikah is a very sacred worship and invokes Barakah and blessings of Allah Ta?ala. Hence, every possible effort should be made to perform the Nikah according to the Shari?ah. The wearing of a wedding gown has the following un-Islamic factors; a) It is generally very expensive and a waste of money. That is against the spirit of the above quoted Hadith. b) The gown is generally worn when the reception is at a hall, wherein, generally, there are many un-Islamic factors, intermingling of sexes, etc. and the bride in her gown is the centre of every person?s attraction including Ghayr Mahram (not prohibited in marriage) males. Anything un-Islamic is void of Barakah and blessings of Allah Ta?ala.\n\nAl-Mahmood 18"
