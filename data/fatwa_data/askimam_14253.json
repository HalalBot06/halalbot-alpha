And if it is not shaved, does any ibadah you do count?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Any clothing which a person wear after semen has dried up will not become Napaak (impure). (Ahsanul Fataawa vol.2)\n\n2. It is necessary for a male and female to remove the pubic hair as well as the hair under the arms. If one allows these hairs to grow over a period of forty days, he will be Makrooh (reprehensible). However, his Ibaadat will be accepted. (Raddul Muhtaar vol.6 pg.407; HM Saeed)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
