  "question": "question about virginity",
  "answer": "QUESTION\ni was wondering say if one were to penetrate a girl's vagina and what not but its only for like a few minutes and u dont ejaculate at all, is the guy still a virgin? since there was no orgasm or ejaculation for him\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe word virgin is used in the context of a female, not a male. However,\nyour concern should not be of maintaing the \"virginity\"or not. It should be\nof having committed an act of Zina (adultery) and of tawba(repentance). To\nbe in isolation with a Ghair Mahram (not prohibited in marriage) female is\nharaam, as that may lead to adultery which is a major sin. If a person\nbecomes intimate and did not ejaculate, that is also Zina (adultery)\nirrespective of not having an orgasm or ejaculation. Such a person should\nmake tawba (repent) sincerely to Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
