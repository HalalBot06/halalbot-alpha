  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a high school student working a clerical job  for an income tax office. There are three tax preparers and two assistants and the assistants forge the tax preparers signatures when they mail confirmation notices to clients. I mail the letters with the forged signatures. It goes without saying the preparers would sign the letters themselves except they work on other things and opportunity cost or whatever. Is that haram -- what I do; do I need to donate some money to compensate for that? For some clarification I don't see a point to having any signature at all;  the confirmations say something like: Your tax return has been confirmed....___(name of preparer) ___(forger signature of preparer)\nIf you have time, I've been wondering if people who say they are Muslims but believe in secular government are truly Muslim?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYour query is not clear. However, a Muslim must be truthful and honest. It is a major sin to lie or deceive. Furthermore, we are advised that we should not do anything that will bring disgrace to us.\n\nIf one is convicted for lies and deception, then he will be punished and disgraced. As Muslims, we should lead a life of respect and dignity.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
