  "question": "I want to knoe if the word \"god\" is suitable to use...",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe, as Muslims, are taught to use the word ?Allah? instead of ?God?. This is on account of the word ?Allah? being unique, referring to One Independent Allah.\n\n?God? on the other hand, has a feminine ?goddess?, accepts partnership, i.e. ?gods? and also accepts dimunitives ?godlings?. Thus, a word of this type doesn?t properly reflect the qualities of Allah. However, if one is addressing a non-Muslim who is not familiar with the word ?Allah?, then ?God? could be used.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
