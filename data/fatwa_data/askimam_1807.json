  "question": "My mother rejected the proposal of a pious man, what may I do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy mother rejected the proposal of a very pious man, whose character and family back ground is also good. My mother don't like religious people, and she denied the proposal on the basis of status. The guy belong to a middle class back ground and we are quite rich. What should I do? Should I try to convince my mother to accept this proposal? or should I remain quite? What if she agree but don't feel good? I am so worried about this matter.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMarriage is a major step in life and we should exercise extreme precaution in choosing one's marriage partner. The following steps should be taken in choosing a partner:\n\n1) Enquire about the boy's character from his associates\n2) Consult with parents and other seniors\n3) Make Istikhara (seek Divine Guidance)\n\nIf there is a disagreement between you and your mother and the proposal has been turned down only due to status, then you should discuss the matter with your mother and agree on deciding on the outcome of Istikhara.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
