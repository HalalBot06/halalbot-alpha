  "question": "What can i do to bring my family into Islam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy entire family is a non-believer. Each day gets more frustrating that the past since their habits are not of Islamic character. Can you tell what I can do to show them this true religion? Can you give any examples that may be applicable?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nHidaayat (guidance) is in the Hands of Allah Taala. He guides whomsoever He wishes. There is no specific Duaa mentioned for this purpose. You should perform two Rakaats of Salaatul Haajat and make Duaa for their Hidaayat, show good character and treat them kindly, and if possible, explain to them about Islam and its teachings. Many people accepted Islam in the time of Nabi (S.A.W.) through his good character and kind treatment to others before and after attaining prophethood. Similarly, when the Sahabah travelled to foreign countries, not knowing their language, people accepted Islam by merely observing their good character and kind treatment of others.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf"
