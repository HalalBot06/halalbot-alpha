(Majmauz-zawaaid vol.9 pg.187-190) Unfortunately, we haven’t found any authentic source for the particular narration in which the mourner will be rewarded by Sayyidatuna Faatima [radhiallaahu anha].\n\nThe month of Muharram is one of the 4 sacred months of the Islamic calendar. These 4 months are known as ‘ash-hurul hurum’ and are even referred to in the holy Qur’aan. (Surah Tawbah Aayat36). The general guideline of Shari’ah is that one should uphold the sanctity of these months by abstaining from sin more seriously and increasing one’s obedience to Allah and His Rasul [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. The Ulama have stated in the light of Hadith that during these months good deeds yield greater reward and evil deeds are more disliked by Allah Ta’ala (Lataaiful Ma’arif pg.163)\n\nOf the 4 sacred months, Hasan Basri [ra] and others were of the opinion that it is Muharram that is most virtuous. In fact, they state that after Ramadhaan, the next most significant month in the Islamic calendar is Muharram (Ibid pg.48). Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has referred to Muharram as ‘Shahrullaah’ (month of Allah). (Sahih Muslim)\n\nConcerning the 10th of Muharram, it is well established that Almighty Allah had caused major events to occur on this day, for example, the ship of Nabi Nuh (alayhimus salaam)had docked on Mount Judai after the floods. Nabi Moosa (alayhimus salaam)and his people were saved from Firawn who was drowned on this day. (Fathul Baari vol.4 pg.310 Hadith2004)\n\nThese 2 Anbiyaa (alayhimus salaam)had observed the fast on this date to express their gratitude to Allah. (Ibid). Therefore, Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] had also done so. Another virtue of fasting on this day is that Allah will forgive one’s sins of the past year. (Sahih Muslim)\n\nHowever, Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has instructed us to add another fast to it, i.e. by fasting on the 9th and 10th or 10th and 11th so that no resemblance with the jews remains as they also fast on the 10th of Muharram. (Musnad Ahmad).\n\nBesides fasting on this blessed day, one should also increase his expenditure on his family. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘He who spends freely on his family on the day of Aashura, Almighty Allah will treat him in the like manner for the rest of the year. (Shu’abul Imaan of Bayhaqi Hadith3795)\n\nThis Hadith has been classified as authentic by several Muhadditheen namely; 1) Imaam al-Bayhaqi [ra] (Shu’abul Imaan Hadith3795), 2) Hafiz ibn Naasir [ra] (al-Maqaasidul Hasanah pg.431; Hadith1193), 3) Hafiz al-Iraqi [ra] )Ibid), 4) Hafiz al-Munzhiri [ra] (al-Targheeb vol.2 pg.116), 5) Hafiz al-Suyooti [ra] (al-Durarul Muntathirah Hadith397, pg.174), 6) Hafiz al-Zarqaani [ra] (Mukhtasarul Maqaasid Hadith1092 pg.227)\n\nLastly, there were several Muhadditheen who claimed to have tried this practice and witnessed the result. (see al-Istizkaar vol.3 pg.214; Ihyaa). The renown Muhaddith of Morocco, Hafizul Maghrib Shaykh Ahmad al-Siddiq al-Ghumariy [ra] has written a booklet entitled, ‘Hadiyyatus sughraa’ in which he has also confirmed this Hadith as authentic.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abasoomar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH SCIENCES\n\nchecked & approved: MUFTI EBRAHM DESAI"
