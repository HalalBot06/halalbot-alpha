  "question": "Rewards of Ramadaan for a Person That cannot Fast due to illness...2. Will my fard also be multiplied 70 times. And a Nafl the reward of a Fard?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am not able to fast due to a chronic illness, and have determined that by past experience that fasting will be detrimental to my health. My questions is will I also have the same benefits as a fasting person. 1. Will my prayers also be accepted as that of a fasting person? 2. Will my fard also be multiplied 70 times. And a Nafl the reward of a Fard? 3.Fasting is a shield against the fire. Will I also be given this shield.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf you are experiencing a chronic illness and unable to fast, due to your deterioting health, then you will be excused. If the sickness is permanent and there is no hope of recovery then you should offer fidya(monetary compensation) for each missed fast. The value of Fidya is the same as Sadaqatul fitr, which is the value of 1.6 KG of wheat or 3.2kg of barley. If the sickness is not permanent, then Fidya cannot be offered. One must make up for the missed fasts later.\n\nIn principle, a sick person is excused and receives all the benefits of the worship of a healthy person. This is by the pure grace of Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
