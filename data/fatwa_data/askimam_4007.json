  "question": "If there is any place on earth where Shariah is strictly followed, it's Afghanistan. Then why are there so many problems there?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is obvious that the present condition in Afghanistan is a culmination of%0D%0Aits past and success in the future largely depends upon considering the%0D%0Aboth, past and present conditions.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn view of the above, it is incorrect to examine the Afghani situation%0D%0Aindependent of the past which have major implications in their present and%0D%0Apossibly future conditions. The Afghani people, instead of being left%0D%0Aindependent to build their culture and freely practise upon their religion,%0D%0Athey were engaged in expelling the foreign forces, namely, the British and%0D%0ASoviet Union followed by a civil war.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Taliban took control over the region and controlled the civil war, to%0D%0Awhich there seemed to be no solution. The Taliban won the confidence of its%0D%0Acitizens and it was their responsibility as a government to protect their%0D%0Acitizens from foreign invaders and foreign influences which can best be%0D%0Aachieved by implementing Islamic Shari'ah.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe reports of being brutal, etc. are at most descriptions from an%0D%0Aadministrative point of view. Some Afghani citizens have been soiled by the%0D%0Acommunist indocrination and when faced with an opposite ideology, it is%0D%0Anatural for such people to criticise the system and unfortunately, the%0D%0Aenemies of an Islamic system capitalise on such reportings and create a%0D%0Amedia hype.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Taliban consists of Allah-fearing Ulama. The quality of being Allah%0D%0Afearing is a sufficient description for their devotion and dedication. The%0D%0Afear for Allah is a driving force to do everything according to the orders%0D%0Aof Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
