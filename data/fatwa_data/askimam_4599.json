  "question": "The Imam in our Masjid, has said that starting to pray 2 rakaat Sunnah of Fajr, when Iqamat is being called is strictly against any Madhab, as it causes Ikhtelaaf (confrontation) with the Imam.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHe suggested, if someone must pray these two rakaats, to pray outside the main hall, because when ?Khat Kha Matis Salaat? is called, it becomes binding to just join the Jamaat. He also said that in such a state, the quality of Salaat would be very poor, as a person tries to quickly wrap up his Sunnah so that he may join the Imam. Please comment on this. When he said this, I raised the question of the non-Hanafis praying 2 Rakaats even when the Khutbah has started for Friday. He said that this was a different issue, and pointed to the Hadith that when a man came and sat down during the Prophet?s Khutbah, he stopped the sermon, and specifically asked the man to stand up and pray 2 rakaat. Are the Hanafis who don?t pray when Khutbah has started in confrontation with the order of the Prophet?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) The Imaam's statement that this is strictly against any Madhab is%0D%0Aincorrect. Consider the following narrations:%0D%0Aa) Abdullah ibn Abi Musa (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Hadhrat Ibn%0D%0AMas'ood (Radhiallaahu Anhu) appeared while the Imaam was reading the (Fardh%0D%0Aof) Fajr. Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiallaahu Anhu) performed two Rakaats (Sunnah)%0D%0Abehind a pillar. As yet, he had not performed the Fajr Salaat.%0D%0Ab) Naafi' (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that, 'I awoke Hadhrat Abdullah ibn%0D%0AUmar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) up for Fajr Salaat while the Iqaamat for Fajr had%0D%0Aalready been given. He stood up and performed two Rakaats (of Sunnah).%0D%0Ac) Abu Uthmaan al-Ansaari narrates that Abdullah ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhu) came for the Fajr Salaat. He had as yet not performed the two Rakaats%0D%0A(Sunnah of Fajr). Hadhrat Abdullah ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhuma) then%0D%0Aperformed the two Rakaats behind the Imaam and then joined in with the%0D%0AImaam. (I'elaa-us-Sunan vol.7 pg.98)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt can be gathered from these narrations that it is permissible to engage in%0D%0Athe Sunnah of Fajr even though the Salaat may have begun. It would be best%0D%0Athat this be un a separate place, like the Musjid courtyard, etc. Great%0D%0Aemphasis have been laid on the Sunnah of Fajr Salaat. In view of this, even%0D%0Athough the quality may be less, it would be better than totally forgoing the%0D%0ASunnah.%0D%0A%0D%0A2) According to the Hanafi Madhab, any Salaat during the Friday Khutbah is%0D%0Aprohibited. With regards to the Hadith of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Apermitting the Sahaabi to perform Salaat during the Friday Khutbah, this was%0D%0Abefore it was prohibited, At first, to speak and to perform Salaat during%0D%0Athe Friday Khutbah was permissible, but later on this permissibility was%0D%0Auplifted. The reason for this prohibition is because the Friday Khutbah is%0D%0Aan integral part of the Jummu'ah Salaat. The Jummu'ah Salaat will not be%0D%0Acompleted without the Khutbah. Just as it is impermissible to speak in%0D%0ASalaat, in the same way, it will not be permissible to speak or perform%0D%0ASalaat or to engage in any other activity during the friday Khutbah.%0D%0A(Bukhari part 1 pg.127; footnote No.9)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Imraan Vawda%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0A"
