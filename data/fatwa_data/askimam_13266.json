  "answer": "QUESTION\nFatwa 13078. However in my case there were no ficticious claims. The insurance company pulled my medical records from the hospital and offered me the settlement amount for my medcial bills, pain and suffering and for any future medical expenses that may arise because of accident. Is this money halaal?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn principle, you are entitled only to the premiums paid by you.
