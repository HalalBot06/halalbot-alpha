  "answer": "QUESTION\nThere is a person who is not a mustanad alim. He delivered a lecture and during his lecture he made many statements. He did not refer to any other alim's fatwa but went on describing these issues by himself from the Qur`an and Sunnah. Some of the statements are as follows:\n \n(1) In hospitals, women nurses cannot work if there are male patients.\n(2) Referring to a dead person in dua is shirk.\n(3) If sovereignty is to anyone other than Allah, it is shirk.\n(4) Standing to the National Anthem is wrong.\n(5) Not following Allah's orders for the benefit of nation is shirk.\n(6) Intentionally commiting a sin is shirk.\n(7) Materialism is a kind of shirk.\n(8) Jihad-e-Kashmir is not Jihad fi Sabeelillah but it is jaiz and is Jihad fi Sabeel-e-Hurriyat (i.e. Jihad in the path of Independance).\n\nCan we call these statements as HIS FATAAWA? One person said to me that FATAWA is a ruling given by a mufti and since he is not a mufti and therefore these statements cannot be referred to as FATAAWA. I want to make him clarify that these statements are FATAAWA and he is doing the job of  a mufti while he is not qualified for this. The question is Can we call these statements as HIS FATAAWA?\n \nAllah Hafiz\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAt the outset, it is incorrect for a community to permit a non-Mustanad (uncertified and unqualified) Aalim to pronounce on issues of Shari’ah. Even if the person’s ‘decrees’ are coincidentally correct, then too he has erred as he spoke without knowledge. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘That person who spoke about the Qur’aan without knowledge and he stated the correct ruling, then too he has erred.’ In another narration, such a person has been warned to prepare his place in the fire.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
