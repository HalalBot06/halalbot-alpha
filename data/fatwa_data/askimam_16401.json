  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nQUESTIONS\n\nGreetings to you in the precious Name of the Saviour.\n\nI am aware that Muslims regard the Qur’an as ‘nazil’, i.e. sent down and that it was given by ‘wahy’ (inspiration). You therefore regard the Qur’an very highly.\n\nSo let us proceed. I am going to trust that since you value the Qur’an so highly, you will check the references given. It will be too lengthy to write them all out\n\nIn S.4:82 we are told to consider the Qur’an. The emphasis of importance of the Q is further stated in S6:34 and S10:64. So if the words of Allah cannot be changed —then surely, to be consistent you must believe this of the Scriptures that preceded the Q? Namely the Old and New Testaments. The Q claims to follow, protect and confirm the Scriptures of Jews and Christians which preceded it - S3:81, 6:92, 35:31 and 46:12.\n\nPharaoh was drowned with his army (S17:102—103). S10:90-92 tells us that he was rescued.\n\nS2:62 tells us that Muslims, Christians and Sabeans are saved. S3:85 tells us only Muslims are saved. Jews and Christians have the curse of Allah on them (S9:30).\n\nDietary and Sabbath laws (S.16:114-119, 124) are contradicted in S16:101.\n\nThere is a change in retaliation laws for murder (S2:178, 17:33)\n\nDays of creation are increased from 6 (S7:54, 25:59, 32:4) to 8 (S41:9-12).\n\nThere is to be no compulsion in religion (S2:256) but those who do not submit to Islam are to be slain (S9:5), beheaded (S47:4) or warred against (S8:39, 9:29).\n\nAllah cursed all liars but Muhammad is permitted to break his own oath (S66:1-2).\n\nS4:157 claims that Jesus did not die. S19:33 states that He died and rose again.\n\nPunishment for adulteresses was changed from life mprisonrnent (S4:1S) to 100 lashes (S24:2), Yet homosexuals were not punished ii they repented (S4:16).\n\nWidows are to be separate from society after their husbands have died for 4 months and10 days (S2:234). This period may also be one year (S2:240).\n\nThe Q states that the sun sets in a spring of murky water (S 18:86). This is certainly wrong.\n\nS67:5, 72:6-9 tells us that stars and meteorites are missiles shot at evil spirits who try to eavesdrop on Quranic readings in heaven! Astronomy helps us here – not the Q.\n\nThe Q says that mountains are used by Allah as weights and tent pegs to stabilise and prevent the earth from shaking (S16:15, 21:31, 31:10, 78:6-7, 88:19). In fact the opposite is true. Mountain ranges result from the earth’s shaking as tectonic plates collide. Mountains don’t hold the earth down. They are a result of the earth being pushed up.\n\nIn S16:101-103 Muhammad was accused by the people of ‘being a forger’. Part of the text says that the man who teaches him has a foreign tongue. Historians tell us that this refers to the Salman the Persian who influenced Muhammad with regard to Zoroastrian religion.\n\nS33:37 Allah gives Muhammad permission to marry Zaynab - she being the only wife of Zaid, Muhammad’s adopted son. Bear in mind Muhammad’s harem was already well-stocked with wives and who knows how many slave girls.\n\nWhy the unwholesome emphasis on sex in paradise, see S38:51, 44:54, 55:55-74, 56:22, 34-36?\n\nIn the first 89 Surahs, Moses’ confrontation with Pharaoh occurs 27 times, Why this mindless repetition?\n\nThe Q certainly does not try to hide the Sin of Muhammad (S40:55, 47:19, 48:1-2, 33:36-38) - Jesus was sinless (S19:19), To Whom should we listen?\n\nS4:23 forbids marriage to 2 sisters at the same time. Mary (the Copt) and Shereena were sisters.\n\n I think this is all for now.\n\n A final word… I am hoping that we may become friends, even though we have to force one another to address hard issues. You see what is at stake is nothing lass than eternity… We are only on this earth for such a short time, but atleast we can help one another with eternity in view.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThe above is a set of questions from Christians. Their aim is to prove inconsistency in the Quran and mislead simple minded Muslims and invite them to Christianity. We advice you to take out time to study this document and educate yourself, in order to guard your Deen. We have made a brief summary of the questions at the beginning of each answer, to facilitate the reader.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai \n\n PLEASE VIEW THE ANSWER BY CLICKING HERE"
