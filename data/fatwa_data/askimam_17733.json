  "question": "Shaykh Imran Hossien and his interpretations",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nassalamualaikum i have watched some videos(jerusalem in the quran,dajjal the antichrist,surah al-kahf and the modern age) of sheikh imran hossein on you tube and i would like to know your opinion on his way of interpreting the quran and the hadiths of nabi (saw). can we can accept his opinions on these issues? jazakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nWe do not know Shaykh Imran Hossein and, thus, are unable to comment on him.  However, we highly recommend that you benefit from the lectures of those who are known to be traditional 'ulamā'.  At the same time, it is important to note that although it is praiseworthy to download audio lectures of 'ulamā' from the internet, this should not and cannot be a replacement from physically attending the gatherings of local 'ulamā' and keeping in close contact with them.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
