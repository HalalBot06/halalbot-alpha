Sister, this man has been fooling around with you and the other lady too.\n\nHe appears to lack dignity and he does not fear Allah Ta’ala.\n\nHe is a very poor example of what a Muslim man should be.\n\nYou have unfortunately fallen into his trap.\n\nIt does not ;look like he  will be prepared to take any responsibility for you or the child.\n\n \n\nYou should consider going to the masjid for help as you have thought about it already.\n\nExplain your situation to them , including your husband’s failure to take care of you and the child.\n\nFind out how they can help you.\n\nAlhamdoelillah you have accepted Islam and you are concerned about raising your child as a Muslim.\n\nInsha’Allah  you will receive help at the masjid. If you do not have any finances nor any financial help, then you do qualify to accept zakaah money.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to ask the masjid for help as soon as possible.\n\nMay Allah Ta’ala protect, guide and assist you out of this difficulty, ameen.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nSocial Dept.\nChecked and Approved by:\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
