  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nI would like to know Sir , watching english moive or hindi movie is good in Islam ?????????\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nWatching TV and movies is a loathsome and heinous act according to Islam because TV and movies constitute multiple great sins, of which even one would be sufficient to render something impermissible. The heinous effect TV and movies have had globally is as apparent as daylight during midday. One of the specialities of TV and movies is that it makes even a sensible person deaf, dumb and blind in that he deems permissible and acceptable the evils and sins displayed and promoted by TV and movies that he would normally, without hesitation, declare to be sinful and evil. He lets himself and his family watch and enjoy the evils that he would normally do everything to keep himself and his family away from. Such is the intoxicating effect of TV and movies that it causes all sense of morality and uprightness to go right down the drain. And because of this, families are breaking apart; immorality, lewdness and promiscuity are becoming the order of the day, the youngsters are becoming more disrespectful to their parents and elders, the youngsters and the adults alike are straying further away from the beautiful teachings of Islam and are instead adopting the ways and lifestyle of the disbelievers and immoral people, people are becoming more and more materialistic and are harbouring aversion to religion, and many other heinous acts are taking place that one would feel ashamed to write about. May Allah Ta’ala protect us.\n\n \n\nHereunder are some sins that a person commits by watching TV and movies:\n\n \n\nLooking at people of the opposite gender without dire necessity and in a way prohibited by Islam. The Quran commands the males and females alike to lower their gazes, and this is not feasible in the case of TV and movies.\nLooking at people who are considered nude in Islam.\nListening to music. Music is a great sin in Islam.\nDisplaying pictures in the house. According to the hadith, pictures prevent angels of mercy from entering the house. If there are no angels of mercy in the house, the house will be full of devils.\nWatching and listening to immoral people and the disbelievers, thereby, creating admiration for them and their ways. The hadith tells us that a person in the life hereafter will be with the ones he loves and admires.\nWatching and listening to things that are forbidden according to Islam, thereby, supporting such forbidden things.\nWasting time. Time is very precious according to Islam.\nPutting oneself in a state of heedlessness. And because of this heedlessness, many salaats are not offered on time or at all.\nSupporting the list of evils mentioned below that TV and movies promote.\nBy letting ones family watch TV and movies, he invites them to commit all of the evils above and below. Therefore, instead of inviting them to the teachings of Islam, he invites them to the wrath of Allah. Instead of guiding them to paradise, he guides them to the fire of Hell.\n\n \n\nNot only are TV and movies evil in themselves, they quite boldly and openly promote evil in all its forms. The following are some evils that movies and TV promote indiscriminately that can be observed by any unbiased, sensible and honest person:\n\n \n\nNudity\nPromiscuity\nIntermingling of the genders\nProfanity\nOffensive language\nTaking alcohol and drugs\nVulgarity\nVanity and arrogance\nViolence\nCrime\nGreed\nCorruption\nDishonesty\nAtheism\nSecularism\nMockery of religion\nDisrespect\nDefiance of authority\nDisobedience of parents, teachers and elders.\nFollowing ones whims and desires indiscriminately\n\n \n\nPlease remember that the list above is by no means exhaustive.\n\n \n\nThe gist of the above is that a Muslim who fears Allah the Almighty and believes in the Day of Judgement and life after death should stay far away from TV and movies. He should, instead, spend his free time in things that please Allah Ta’ala such as listening to lectures of the Ulama (scholars), reading the Quran, hadith and Islamic literature, taking part in ilmi and deeni gatherings, etc. Also, one should take the warnings contained in the following Quranic verses seriously:\n\n \n\nTranslation:\n\n \n\nO you who believe! enter into Islam fully  and do not follow the footsteps of Satan; surely he is your open enemy. (Quran 2:208)\n\n \n\nVerily Satan is an enemy to you: so treat him as an enemy. He only invites his adherents that they may become companions of the Blazing Fire. (Quran 35:6)\n\n \n\nAnd let not Satan turn you aside. Lo! he is an open enemy for you. (Quran 43:62)\n\n \n\nThe reckoning has drawn near to men, and in heedlessness are they turning aside. (Quran 21:1)\n\n \n\nO you who believe, save your souls, and those of your families, from the fire whose fuel is men and stones, over which are set angels fierce and terrible; who disobey not Allah in what He has commanded them, but perform what they are commanded. (Quran 66:6)\n\n \n\nA poet has pertinently described the evil of letting loose and not controlling ones gaze, and it aptly applies to watching TV and movies:\n\n \n\nكل الحوادث مبداها من النظر ... ومعظم النار من مستصغر الشرر\n\nوالمرء ما دام ذا عين يقلبها ... في أعين العين موقوف على الخطر\n\nكم نظرة فعلت في قلب فاعلها ... فعل السهام بلا قوس ولا وتر\n\nيسر ناظره ما ضر خاطره ... لا مرحباً بسرور عاد بالضرر\n\n \n\nTranslation:\n\n \n\nAll evil occurrences begin with ones glance,\n\nAnd most fires are caught by (negligence of) those who deem sparks insignificant.\n\nA man remains in danger as long as his eyes scrutinize the eyes of (beautiful) women with large (gorgeous) eyes,\n\nHow many a glance has done to the heart the same as what an arrow would do -- without any bow or string.\n\nThe one glancing is pleased with what harms his inner self.\n\nNo thanks to pleasure that brings harm.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\n\n\nMl.
