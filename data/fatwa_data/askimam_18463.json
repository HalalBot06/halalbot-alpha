  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI see and undertand all the conflicts going on between the muslims and none muslims, so decided to boycott companies and individuals who support these conflicts.\n\nLast week I bought some Fish from Sainsburys, after getting it home and a few days later.  I realised that it has the Jewish Star sign, therefore I know that the £4 I paid has gone to Israel to aid them.\n\nI tried getting it replaced/exchanged/refunded as I still had a rceipt and nothig was wrong with it.  But had no luck so far because its a chilled product.  I'm still in the processing of sorting this.\n\nAs far as I know all the ingredients inside a halal.\n\n1. If all else fails, would I be allowed to eat this or would it be haraam for me , as I cannot give it back or get my money back and I know that my money will be used in conflicts.\n2. We have to pay Taxes here - this money is also used in these conflicts but we have to pay so what does Islam say about this?\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh  \n\n \n\n1) If there is no contamination of any Haraam substances added to the fish, the fish will be Halaal and suitable to consume. The mere fact that a company supports a particular issue will not render the products of that company to be Haraam\n\n \n\n2) A Muslim living in a Non-Muslim country should comply and adhere to all the rules and regulations laid down by that country on condition such rules are not unislamic. It does not befit a Muslim to merely live in a Non-Muslim country, make use of all the facilities it provides and then refuse to pay the taxes due on him. In our opinion, reasonable taxes due to the state are a legitimate charge and should be paid. Thereafter, if the state uses a portion of these taxes to aid certain conflicts, it is beyond his control and he will not fall in the ambit of assisting in sin.\n\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftāa"
