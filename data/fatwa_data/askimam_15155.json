  "question": "Authenticity of the Hadith on people migrating to Shaam after it being conquered",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) I want to know the meaning of the following Ahadith\n\nMuwatta Imam Malik - Madeena\n\n Book 45, Number 45.2.7:\n\nMalik related to me from Hisham ibn Urwa from his father from Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr that Sufyan ibn Abi Zuhayr said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Yemen will be conquered and the people will be attracted to it, taking their families and whoever obeys them. Madina would have been better for them, had they but known. Ash-Sham will be conquered and people will be attracted to it, taking their families and whoever obeys them. Madina would have been better for them, had they but known. will be conquered and people will be attracted to it, taking their families and whoever obeys them. Madina would have been better for them, had they but known.' \"\n\nBook 45, Number 45.2.8:\n\nYahya related to me from Malik from Ibn Himas from his paternal uncle from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Madina will be left in the best way that it is until a dog or wolf enters it and urinates on one of the pillars of the mosque or on the mimbar.\" They asked, \"Messenger of Allah! Who will have the fruit at that time?\" He replied, \"Animals seeking food, birds and wild beasts.\"\n\n2 )Secondly is the suicide Bombing or attack allowed if allowed then can civilians be targeted?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThis hadith is from miracles of Nabi (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) in which he prophesized the sequence of events that will occur in the near future.  The events occurred exactly how they were mentioned from the blessed lips of Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam).  First was conquered, then Shaam, and thereafter .  After the conquest of these lands, many people left the holy city of Madinah in search of ease and comfort and resided in these conquered lands.  Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) has said that if these people knew of the blessing of the holy city of Madinah, they would not have left.  Ulema have states some of the blessings as following:\n\nDajjal and plagues will not enter the holy city of Madinah.\nThe trials and tribulations will be less in Madinah in comparison with other places.\nExcluding Makkah, salah offered in Madinah is greater in reward than any other place.\nThe blessing of being in close proximity to the holy grave of Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam).\n\nThis final blessing is the greater blessing as no other blessing can surpass this.\n\nHadith 2\n\nThis hadith indicates that a time will come in which the city of Madinah will be empty to the extent that there will not remain a person to chase the dogs and wolves from urinating on the pillars of the masjid.  The Sahabah asked who will have the fruit in this period.  It seems as if the Sahabah were asking whether most of the people will leave the city or every single person will leave.  Nabi’s (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) answer confirmed the latter.\n\nImam Nawawi says that the apparent and accepted view is that this incident will occur in the future at the end of time before Qiyamah.  Abu Abdullah bin Arafah and Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani are also of this view. \n\nQadhi Ayadh is of the opinion that this incident has already occurred.  Qurtubi and Allamah Zarqani also adopt this view.\n\n3.Muslims are commanded to respect civilians and refrain from harming them. The ahadith of Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) teach us to treat non-Muslims in such a manner that their lives and wealth are safe around the Muslims.\n\n \n\nعن أبي هريرة ، عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ، قال المسلم من سلم المسلمون من لسانه ويده ، والمؤمن من أمنه الناس على دمائهم وأموالهم (رواه الترمذى وقال هذا حديث حسن صحيح و رواه النسائ فى سننه و احمد فى مسنده)\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Hurairah that Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) has said, “A true Muslims is he from whom other Muslims are safe from his hands and speech.  And a true believer is he from whom other people’s lives and wealth are in safety.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
