  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIn Islam Is it prohibited or not recommended to eat fish and egg together; fruits and milk together; shrimps, prawns and crabs?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1. \n\nShariah has not discussed the issue of eating fish together with eggs or fruits together with milk.  It will be permissible to eat them together as there is not Shar’ee prohibition.  If a doctor or hakeem states that is it harmful to combine the two and one trusts his opinion, then they should refrains from combining the two.\n\n2.\n\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhhab, only fish is permissible to consume from sea food animals.  There is a difference of opinion amongst the Hanafi Jurists whether shrimps/prawns falls under fish.  Those who say it is a fish state it will be permissible to consume.  Those who are of the view that prawns/shrimps are not fish say it is impermissible to consume.  It is better to adopt precaution and avoid eating it.  Consider the following hadith:\n\nدع ما يريبك إلى ما لا يريبك\n\nLeave that which is doubtful for which is not doubtful. (Al-Tirmidhi & Al-Nasa’i)\n\nCrabs are not lawful to consume.\n\nFatawa Mehmoodia (18/212&267) Jamia Farooqiya\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
