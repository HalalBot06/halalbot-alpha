  "question": "I stole money from people in the past (people I know and people I don't know). I repent to Allah. Can I donate the money to Allah or should I confess to these people and give the money back to them?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI repent to ALLAH (SWT)I stole money from people in the past (people I still know and people I don't know anything about them now)... Alhamdolelah I repent to ALLAH (SWT) and I will never do that again Inshaa ALLAH. The money I stole is approximately $2000. I wantto to donate the money to my local Masged for the Palestanian people. In my heart, this money comes from the people I stole it from. I will not write my name or let any body knows that it's coming from me. And ALLAH only knows of course what's in my heart. Is what I'm doing is right and correct, or should I confess to the people I stole the money from and give it back to them\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf you stole money from people you know, you should return the money to\nthem. It is not necessary to inform them that you are returning their stolen\nmoney.\n\nYou may give them the stolen money as a gift. If you stole money from people\nyou do not know and/or cannot locate them, then that amount should be given\naway as charity to the poor and needy, for example, Palestinians, on behalf\nof the owner/s.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
