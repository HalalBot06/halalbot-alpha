  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat to do if your husband doesn't like your dad/brothers and constantly curses them and complains about them behind them to me, but he doesn't say anything to them, because he's upset with them for not watching our children? He always complains whenever I talk to my brothers, saying \"why are you concerned about them, if they aren't concerned about you or your children\" Gossiping? What stuff comes in that category? And how to stop if I am doing that? Also, Is talking to your husband/father/mother/brothers about other family gossips, considered gossiping? Also, when I first start namaaz,I say at the end \"deen islam kay\", I noticed recently that i have been saying \"deem\" intead of \"deen\". Are all the namaaz I prayed null/void? What to do when your child falls ill do to nazar? and you don't know who the nazar was of? What to do if you find out that someone's father molested her? What do I tell them? The girl is now married and away, but still makes her feel uncomfortable when she sees her father and mother, and her husband knows about it. Her husband doesn't like her father, and always complains about him in front of her saying he's crooked and mean and acts as though he's very religious. How to get out of this mess?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Our suggestion is you have a heart to heart discussion with him and\nexpose whatever is troubling you.\n2. You should maintain contact with your parents and other family relatives\neven if your husband wishes to sever relationship with them. However, you\nshould not overdo it. Maintain a moderate relationship with them in such a\nmanner that it does not offend your husband.\n3. If it falls under the category of Gheebat (backbiting), it is not\npermissible to engage in such gossiping.\n4. Your Salaat is in order.\n5. Get the child checked by a competent Aamil - a person well-versed in this\nfield. Also, recite Surah Faatiha and the last 3 Quls and blow on the\nperson. Continue with this as often as possible.\n6. If she is certain that her father has mended his ways and repented, she\nshould maintain a good relationship with him and try to forgive him.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
