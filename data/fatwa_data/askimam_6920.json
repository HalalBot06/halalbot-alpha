  "question": "Validity of family's claim to be in possession of part of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)'s hair strands.Is this possible?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nA friend of mine and his family believe that they are in possession of part of Rasulullah(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)'s hair strands. Somehow or the other, it has been passed down from generation through generation, and they insist that it 'grows' in lengnth every year. Is this possible? im very sceptical as i have never heard of this before , and as Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)is not omnipresent, or to suggest that 'growing hair' is a sign of life thus it is incorrect?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe hair of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is noble and a means of attaining blessing but it is of utmost importance that it is proven from a solid source and research that this hair was taken from the blessed body of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).Nowadays the people who claim to have possession of the noble hair of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) do not have any proof to substantiate their claim.\n\nThe merely growing of the hair is no proof of it being a part of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)s body. Only that hair has the ability to grow which is connected to the body. Once it has been severed, it does not have the ability to continue growing thereafter, that is why all the jurists are unanimous that there is no life in hair.\n\nAand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
