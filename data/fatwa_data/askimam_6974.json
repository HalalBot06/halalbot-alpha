  "question": "Is it permissable to read the translation of Saheeh Al-Bukhari by Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe do not have any apparent reason for discouraging the aforementioned translation of Sahih Bukhari.\n\nHowever, we are unable to comment on the brief commentary that is included in it. Furthermore, we do not encourage people who are not fully equipped with the technicality of Islamic jurisprudence to merely open a book of Hadith that consists of various types of narrations for the fear that this may lead to unnecessary confusion.\n\nWe suggest more simple works such as Riyaadhus-saaliheen of Imaam Nawawiy which has Ahaadith on more practical and pertinent topics.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
