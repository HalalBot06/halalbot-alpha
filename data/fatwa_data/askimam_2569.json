  "question": "I have a question ragarding the Ark of the Covenant. Is it mentioned in the Noble Qur'an and/or Hadith?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIt is said that, according to the Jews and Christians, the Ark is a chest or a box that contains the Commandments carried by Musa and his people, Hebrews. There are still excavations in process to recover this Ark especially in Ethiopia and Jordan. As I was doing a study of the Quran on another matter, I came across Ayat 2:248 and it goes: \"And their Prophet (Samuel, 'Aleihi Salaam) said to them: Verily! The sign of His kingdom is that there shall come to you At-Tabut (a wooden box), wherein is Sakinah (peace and reassurance) from your Lord and a remnant of that which Musa and Harun left behind, carried by the angels. Verily, in this is a sign for you if you are indeed believers.\" Is this the same box or ark in question? What is your knowledge pertaining to this subject? May Allah Bless you brother, and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not possible for us to comment on whether the Ark in question is the Tabut referred to in the Qur'aan or not. and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai FATWA DEPT."
