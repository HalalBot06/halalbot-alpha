  "question": "Is it Islamically acceptable for me to become an English lawyer after studying for an English Law degree?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nOr will it be haram earnings and why? I ask this because I know that any man made law is haram and therefore to be a lawyer in England would mean that I would be in a sense advocating english law? Please clarify.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Your request relates to constitutional rights of Muslims in non-Muslim\ncountries. It is obvious that at all times the supremacy of the law of the\nland will be upheld. Hence, in a conflict between Islamic law and law of the\nland, it seems impossible to succeed in securing such Islamic rights. For\nexample, in view of contemporary woman's liberation movements, polygamous\nmarriages will not be facilitated, this will be in clear conflict with\nIslamic law regarding polygamous marriages. We suggest you also consult with\nMuslim who have expertise in constitutional matters relating to minorities\nof a non-Muslim country.\n2.
