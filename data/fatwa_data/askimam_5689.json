  "answer": "QUESTION\nAm I beeing narrow minded? I wanted some advice on different sects in Islam. I personally have great love for the Ulama especially the Deobandi Ulama (like yourself). The thing I am worried about is that when people from different groups like Hizb ut Tahrir come and talk to me with their views on Khilafah I do not listen to them with an open mind. I am too used to the Deobandi \"school of thought\". As I am aware of the importance on establishing the khilafah but I myself believe that the Jamiatul Ulama are the ones who have most success in these political issues. The thing I wanted to know is that by not listening to views of other groups am I being narrow minded and therefore am I sinful. Please could you give me advice on the best possible approach to matters like this involving different sects in Islam. Jazakallahu Khair. May Allah grant you a place in the highest ranks of Jannah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour approach is correct. You are being cautious and not narrow minded.\n\nWe also disagree with the views of Hizbut-Tahreer.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
