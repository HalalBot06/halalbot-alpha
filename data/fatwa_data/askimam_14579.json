  "question": "Can you please tell me how to get rid of hurt that I am feeling? I had a girlfriend",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamo Allaykum\n\nCan you please tell me how to get rid of hurt that I am feeling? I had a girlfriend who I am no longer with however I am very hurt because it did not work out and lead to marriage as I would have liked. I am aware that in Islam having a relationship is wrong and alhamdulillah I have not been with anybody else since our relationship finished well over a year ago.\nCan you please advise me in terms of what I can do/pray to get rid of the hurt I am feeling?\n\nJazakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\n Brother/Sister in Islam\n\nAs Muslims, we believe in Taqdeer. That is the absolute knowledge of Allah on all our matters. Whatever happens to us, it is the will and decree of Allah. We are the slaves of Allah and we accept whatever Allah decrees for us. If we experience pain for some reason or the other that is a blessing in disguise. The pain yields great rewards for us and wipes out our sins. However, there is one condition for yielding such reward. Every time you think of that pain and hurt say Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajioon. Also ponder upon the meaning of that. We are from Allah and we will return to Allah.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\n Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
