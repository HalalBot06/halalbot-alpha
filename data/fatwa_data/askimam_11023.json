He is the one who has created us(mankind). Every thing belongs to him. He is the original owner of every thing. Allah Ta'ala says in the Holy Quran\" All praises are to Allah Ta'ala, who has created the heavens and the earth and has made the darkness and the light. ( Alanaam:1).%0D%0A%0D%0A2. There are many ways to prove God's existence. The following example is a good illustration: -The first would be through contemplating this world. By contemplating, one would realize that everything in this world is so well organized, i.e., there is no single thing in the whole universe that is not subject to a certain order or to a certain law. If we take as an example the sun, we find that if the sun goes out of its orbit and gets closer to the earth, everything on the earth would burn out, and if it goes farther, everything would freeze and life on this earth would be impossible. The same order exists at the micro level of a minute cell. Therefore, any person who reflects on the complexity and extreme order of the universe, cannot think that the creation operates under a random and chaotic law. Now, if something materialistic was so well organized, one would intuitively think that there must be someone who organized it this way. Like if one gets into a room and finds it so neat and tidy, he%2Fshe would think straight away that there must be someone who got into that room and tidied it up this way. Then, what about this whole world where we find that everything in it is in its perfect place. Therefore, we conclude that there must be a creator and a master who is all knowing, all wise, all able, and all powerful to do so: and that cannot be but One God. This is only one example and there are millions of examples that can lead any objectively-minded, reasonable person to believe that there is One and Only God.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. According to Islam and divine book people, the concept is God is mostly same, but according to Hinduism the concept is God different. According to them God could be almost anything.%0D%0A%0D%0A4.

The Quran is the most authentic book on the surface of this earth. None can challenge its authenticity. And it is authentic because, it has been moving from the time of revelation with a large number of people in its original condition, which is called Mutawaatir. Also, Allah Ta'ala himself has taken the responsibility of its protection and preservation from any changes made to either words or meanings of it.%0D%0A%0D%0A8. Allah Ta'ala states in Quran: \"Surely, We have revealed this book (Quran) and surely shall rescue it (from any changes).%0D%0A%0D%0A9. Islam has the most authentic sources of knowledge, for example Quran, and Hadith. And Islam's rules are based upon these two. It is a proven fact that if the basis of a religion provided are strong and authentic, it makes the religion true. Allah Ta'ala mentiones in Holy Quran: \"Surely, The only religion accepted by Allah Ta'ala is Islam\".(Aal-e- Imran 14).%0D%0A%0D%0A10. Hanafi, Shafi, Maliki and Hanbli are the four major different schools of thought in Islam, and are in practice today in the world. There basic principles are common, but have juridical differences.%0D%0A%0D%0A11. Imam Tirmidhi, Bukhari and Muslim are among prominent well-learned scholars of Hadith.
