  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have two questions regarding hajj.\nMy mother decided to going for Hajj this year.As my father is not alive,so my brother is going with her.\nMy mother is 50 years old.Is it permissible for her to take medicine to stop her monthly menstrual period temporarily in the time of Hajj?\n\nMy second question is regarding my brother.He is 26 years old studying dental science.Can he do Hajj of my father as he is not alive?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is permissible for your mother to take medicine to temporarily stop her menstruation. You should consult a doctor to avoid any health risks.\n\nYour brother may perform Hajj on the behalf of your father. However, if he has not yet completed his own obligatory Hajj, it will be makrÅ«h for him to perform Hajj on the behalf of another person before performing his own Hajj.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
