  "question": "Are Muslims living in non-Muslim countries bound to obey the traffic lawsof that country? Is the speeding fine Islamic?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMuslims living in a non-Muslim country are bound to follow the laws of\nthe country as long as they are not contrary to Shari?ah.\nAccording to the Shari?ah, public amenities, for example, roads, parks, etc.\nshould be used without causing any harm to another person. (Buhooth fi\nQadhaaya fiqhiyya Mu?aasira; pg.292) Speeding on public roads is a great\ndanger to the lives of others. It is the responsibility of the government to\nensure the safety of its citizens by enforcing strict speed control. The\nspeeding fine is one of other deterrents of speed control.\nAny person convicted of overspeeding is duty bound by the Shari?ah to pay\nthe speeding fine.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best,\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
