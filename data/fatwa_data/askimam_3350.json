  "question": "Can we be excused in not wearing hijab?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe live in a Christian country. It is very hard to look for job and enter school since they require uniform if we wear our hijab. Can we be forgiven if we don't wear our hijab to find a job and go to school. Please advise. Salaam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf there is a need for a female to work, for example, there is no male\nrelatives, friends or welfare organisation to assist her, then as a last\nresort she may seek employment to support herself. However, she must cover\nherself completely when she leaves home. If that is an obstacle in getting\nemployment, she should at least dress modestly by concealing the form and\nshape of her body.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
