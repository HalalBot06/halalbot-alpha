  "question": "I recently learned that the punishment a sin I committed is death. What should I do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am an American-born Muslim. When I was 21 I committed a sin that I recently learned should be punished by death. Since then I have not returned to that sin. I want Allah SWT to be pleased with me on the Day of judgement. Iwas wondering if I should seek someone in an Islamic country to carry out this hudd. Or would it be acceptable for me to give my life in Jihaad? Please help...\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n%0D%0ATo err is human. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'All the children%0D%0Aof Aadam (Alayhis salaam) are sinners and the best of sinners are those who%0D%0Aoffer abundant repentance.' In view of this Hadith, we learn that the%0D%0Aanecdote for sins is Tawbah (repentance).%0D%0A%0D%0AIt should be clearly borne in mind that Allah's glory is exalted. Hence,%0D%0Amercy at any time. Allah, the Almighty says in the noble Qur'aan, 'Oh my%0D%0Apeople! Those of you who have wronged themselves, do not lose hope of Allah'%0D%0As Mercy. Verily, Allah will forgive all sins. Verily, He is the Most%0D%0AForgiving, Most Merciful.' Istighfaar ((begging pardon for sins) is a means%0D%0Aof obtaining forgiveness for sins and making amends for all shortcomings. In%0D%0Afact, the aforementioned Aayat revealed with regards to a person who used to%0D%0Asteal, commit adultery, drink liquor, etc. Hence, through earnest Tawbah,%0D%0AAllah will through His mercy forgiven one no matter how grave a person's sin%0D%0Amay be. There are a few prerequisites of repentance:%0D%0A1. Sincere remorse and a feeling of shame at the sin which has been%0D%0Acommited.%0D%0A2. To make a firm resolve not to commit the sin again.%0D%0A3. Just as one has witnessed himself disobeying Allah, he now beholds%0D%0Ahimself in his obedience.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf the abovementioned is maintained, then we have hope in Allah that He will%0D%0Aaccept your repentance and forgive you. The elements mentioned in your query%0D%0Aneed not be adopt for forgiveness.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
