  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf any person claims that he or she has seen Rasool Allah (pbuh). how much we can trust on his or her claim. Since this is a era of fitna and lot many people calims that they have seen Rasool Allah (pubh) and they point out hadit in their favour that  Saitan can never take the appearance of Rasool Allah (pubh).\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nRasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasalaam) is reported to have said \"whoever sees me in the dream then certainly he has seen me as Shaytaan does not come in my form\". Therefore, whoever claims to have seen nabi (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasalaam) in the dream will be accepted.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
