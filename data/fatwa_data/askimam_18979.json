  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAsslamualaikum, I am looking for a girl for marriage. How do we come to know that the girl is religious. What should we look for in the girl and family. Do we judge by- Burqa, namaz abstinence from TV etc. Jazakalla Hu Khair\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nWhen deciding whom to marry one should consider the golden advice`s of Nabī (Sallāllāhualaīhiwasalam):\n\n \n\nNabī (Sallāllāhu alaīhi wasalam) urged his Ummah to marry religious woman.\n\n \n\nNabī (sallāhu alihi wasalam) said: “\n\n \n\nWomen are married because of four reasons, for her wealth, for her lineage, for her beauty and for her Dīn, give preference to the women with Dīn, you will attain success.”\n\n(Sahih Muslim 4/175,dar aljeel, Beirut)\n(Mishkāt ul Masābīh, Pg. 267, Vol. 6, Deoband) [1]\n\nNabī (Sallāllāhu alahi wasalam) has also said:\n\nMarry a caring/loving woman who can bear children, as I will boast with the number of my followers on the Day of Qiyāma.\n\n(Mishkātul Masābīh,ibid)[2]\n(Mirqāt ul Mafātīh, Pg.192, Vol.6, Multān)\n\nIn another Hadīth Nabī (Sallāllāhu alaihiwasalm) has said:\n\nMarry virgin women, for verily their mouths are quite pure, and their wombs are cleaner, and they are pleased with less.\n\nThe Ulamā have explained the words “their mouths are quite pure” to mean; their kiss and their speech are pure. Furthermore they have more modesty, and they are passionate towards their husbands.\n\n(Mirqāt ul Mafātīh. IBID)[3]\n\nOne should seek a spouse who will be a good mother to his children, and will be of such character that will help her husband in fulfilling the obligations of Dīn.\n\nA person’s character cannot be determined from his outward appearance. So a burqa cannot be used as a yard stick for determining the piety of a woman. It is possible that a woman wears Hijāb simply because her parents have forced her, or because the women she associates herself with wear Hijāb. It could even be possible that the girl might have a noble and pious family but she herself is not at all pious. So it would be best that you consult with those who know the girl on a personal level. If it is not possible for you to do this then you could request a female member of your family to do this for you.\n\nOne should seek guidance from Allāh Tā`la when deciding matters of such importance. Nabī (Sallāllāhu alaīhi wasalam) has taught us a way of seeking guidance from Allāh Tā`la. It is as follows:\n\nIstikhāra is a means of seeking guidance from Allāh Tā`la. Nabī (Sallāllāhualaīhiwasalam has shown us a method of Istikhāra:\n\nNabī (Sallāllāhu alahiwasalam) used to say:\n\nIf one of you is concerned about some practical undertaking, or about making plans for a journey, he should perform two Rak`āts, not as an obligatory observance, but voluntarily.  Then he should recite the following:\n\nاللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْتَخِيرُكَ بِعِلْمِكَ وَأَسْتَقْدِرُكَ بِقُدْرَتِكَ وَأَسْأَلُكَ مِنْ فَضْلِكَ العظيم، فَإِنَّكَ تَقْدِرُ وَلَا أَقْدِرُ وَتَعْلَمُ وَلَا أَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتَ عَلَّامُ الْغُيُوبِ اللَّهُمَّ إِنْ كُنْتَ تَعْلَمُ ان هَذَا الْأَمْرَ خَيْر ديني و معاشي و عاقبة امري فَاقْدُرْهُ لِي- وَيَسِّرْهُ لِي ثُمَّ بَارِكْ لِي فِيهِ-  وَإِنْ كُنْتَ تَعْلَمُ هذا الامر شَرٌّ لِي فِي دِينِي وَمَعَاشِي وَعَاقِبَةِ أَمْرِي فَاصْرِفْه عني و اصرفني عَنْهُ وَاقْدُرْ لِي الْخَيْرَ حَيْثُ كَانَ ثُمَّ رَضِّنِي بِهِ))\n\n \n\n(Saheeh Al Bu khari, Pg. 208,Vol .7 Darul Fikr[4])\n\n\nO Allah, I ask You to show me what is best, through Your knowledge, and I ask You to empower me, through Your power, and I beg You to grant me Your tremendous favor, for You have power, while I am without power, and You have knowledge, while I am without knowledge, and You are the One who knows all things invisible. O Allah, if You know that this undertaking is in the best interests of my religion, my life in this world, and my life in the Hereafter, and can yield successful results in both the short term and the long term, then make it possible for me and make it easy for me, and then bless me in it. If not, then turn it away from me, and make it easy for me to do well, wherever I may happen to be,  and make me content with Your verdict.\n\nInshāllah, Allāh Tā`la will inspire you with the correct decision and Allāh Tā`la will decree good in that decision for.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl. Muhammed Sindhi,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā\n\n \n\n\n\n\n تنكح المرأة لاربع لمالها ، و لحبسها ، لو لجمالها، و لدينها، فاظفر فذات الدين تربت يداك (مشكاة المصابيح،كتاب النكاح ، الفصل الاول)[1]\n\nا الودود الولود ،فاني مكاثر بكم الامم ((مشكاة المصابيح،كتاب النكاح ، الفصل الاول) تزوجو [2] \n\nكناية عن طيب قبلنهن او طيب كلامهن و كونه الذ و عن قلة الفحش و عدم سلاطتها على زوجها.  قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم عليكم بالابكار فانهن أعذب افواها و انتق ارحاما و ارضى بالقليل،(افواها،  [3]\n\n صحيح البخاري باب الدعاء عند الاستخارة [4]"
