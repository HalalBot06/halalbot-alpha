  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf I get somebody appointed to a particular post through my contacts,can I charge some money in return for such an appointment. Appointment is according to the person's ability and only a capable person gets the job.The amount that I ask for is such that can be easily paid through the salary for that particular post and I make the person aware of this well before the appointment. I dont charge anything in advance but only after the appointed individual gets his salary. Is such money halal for me or not?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nRespected brother/sister in Islaam\n\nAs salaamu alaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\nThis particular transaction is termed as Wakaalah in Sharee’ah. It is permissable to charge a specific fee for the services you provide. However the amount has to be specified before the transaction.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
