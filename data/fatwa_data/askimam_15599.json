  "question": "Is it permissable to go to a gynae while fasting?...",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs Jemimah and MihzabÂ a muslim name? Is it appropriate to name a baby girl 1 of those? Whats the meaning of those names? How do you pronounce the name Saifullah? Can you name a baby boy that?\n\nIs it permissable to go to a gynae while fasting? Will your fast still be accepted?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nJemimah and Mizhab are not appropriate names. Saifullah means the sword of Allah. It is an appropriate name. It is permissible to go to a gynaecologist during fasting. If there is a genuine need to conduct an internal check up, then only will it be permissible and in such a situation, the fast will not be invalidated.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
