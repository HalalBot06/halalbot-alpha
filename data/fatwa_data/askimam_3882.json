  "question": "Is it permissible for a non muslim woman to read the Holy Quran in bed while lying down (for the sake of gaining knowledge of Islam)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two aspects to your query: a) Recitation of the noble Qur'aan, b)\nIn the context of a non-Muslim.\n\nThe Qur'aan and Ahaadith are replete with orders to respect the noble Qur'\naan. Therefore, in principle, lying down and reciting the noble Qur'aan is\ndisrespectful. However, in the case of a non-Muslim, the strict rules of\nrespecting the Qur'aan are relaxed. It suffices that he/she (non-Muslim)\napproaches the Qur'aan with the intention and hope to learn about the Qur'\naan. Imaam Abu Hanifa (RA) said, 'I do not have any objection in giving the\nQur'aan to a non-Muslim as it is hoped he/she will be guided (by reading the\nQur'aan).'
