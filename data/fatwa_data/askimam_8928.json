  "question": "i was lied to at the time of marriage...his family expects my mother to help out i don't want that as it is i am finding it difficult to forgive him",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nmy husband had an enormous debt burden when he married me now the situation has been exposed and my life has been ruined as we are threatened for our lives by the debt collectors his family expects my mother to help out i don't want that as it is i am finding it difficult to forgive him pls advise.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are always ups and downs which a person has to go through in life, simply because this life is a test. Allah Ta?ala wishes to see how well we pass these tests.\n\nSecondly, what good will you get if you do not forgive him? Instead, it will make things worse. After all, he is your husband and has made a home with you. Both of you have to hold hands together to make things go smoothly. It is incorrect to apply pressure on your family to pay the debts as this will only add fuel to the fire. Be patient, turn to Allah Ta?ala by virtue of your Salaat and constant Du?aa. Insha Allah, Allah will open the way.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
