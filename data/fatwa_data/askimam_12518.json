  "question": "I just wanted to ask if being muslims are we allowed to be on a jury in the courtroom?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is incumbent upon a Muslim to pass judgment in light of Shari?ah and not against it. Therefore if the case in court is of such a type wherein one will not be passing the verdict against the Shari?ah then it will be permissible for him to be on the jury, otherwise not.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf\nDARUL IFTA ?
