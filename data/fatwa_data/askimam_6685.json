  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe most important factor is the protection of the gaze. Sexual and lustful gazes are totally Haraam. Bear in mind that Allah Ta?ala is watching you at all times. Inculcate the fear of Allah Ta?ala both in public and in privacy.\n\nThen, eat in moderation, and avoid foods that create heat in the body. At the time of going to sleep, remain in the Dhikr of Allah Ta?ala for as long as one can.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
