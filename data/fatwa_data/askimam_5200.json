  "question": "Can a wife perform the circumcision of her husband",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Mufti Saheb we are married 12 years my husband is not circumcised can I circumcise him he is afraid. Can I get the procedure done without letting him know. I am a doctor I can do it have never done for an adult before\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, it is permissible to circumsize your husband. (Shaami vol.6\npg.382; HM Saeed)\n\nHowever, you should tell him about your intention together with explaining\nits importance in Shari'ah. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Ten\nthings are from amongst the nature of man. One being that of circumcision.'\n(Abu Dawud pg.8; HM Sa'eed). Secondly, it is from the 'Shi'aar' (signs of\nIslaam) which has to be upheld at all times. If a person is not circumsized,\nthere is a great possibility of urine remaining on the private part, hence,\nwill lead to the invalidity of the Salaat, regarding which Nabi (Sallallaahu\nAlayhi Wasallam) said, 'Be cautious while relieving yourself, for verily,\npeople will be punished in grave for neglectfulness in this regard.'\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
