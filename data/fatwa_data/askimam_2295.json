  "question": "Why is it that Prophet Muhammad SAW received the Quran verse by verse and not all of it at once?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Qur'aan was revealed in stages over a period of 23 years and not as a\ncomplete book in one single revelation. Hereunder some reasons for that:\n1. To strengthen the heart of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) by\naddressing him continuously and wherever the need for guidance arose.\n2. To gradually implement the laws of Allah.\n3. To make understanding, application and memorisation of the Qur'aan easier\nfor the believers.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
