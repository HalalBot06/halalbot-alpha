  "question": "I would like to know that can a man have sex with two or more of his wives in one room.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know that can a man have sex with two or more of his wives in one room. Mufti Sahab I would like to know that If there are two, three or four females in my Nikkah and I would like to have sex with two or more at a same time in one room, it is allowed? If I call two of my wives to one room and start having sex so it is right or wrong?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAlthough the laws of Satar are relaxed between a man and his wives, such laws are not relaxed between the co-wives. Laws of Satar still apply rigidly between them. Hence, it is not permissible to have intercourse with more than one wife at the same time.\n\nAlso, it is a shameless thing to do.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
