  "question": "Can I pray to Allah for her return to me?She has committed to marry someone and has asked me not to call her again.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am 26 year old male. 13 years ago when I was studying in my school I started to like a girl. I continued liking her, never told anyone about it and on reaching my 11th grade somehow managed to contact her and we developed a relationship over the phone. This continued for 2 years after which I wanted to propose her but couldn?t because I had not completed my studies. It was my bad luck that I got admission into a university in another city and I had to go. We communicated through letters but for a couple of months. I then was involved in my studies but never forgot her. When I came back home for holidays I couldn?t contact her because of a great mishap in my family. I returned to my studies and when I retuned home for the second time I tried to contact her and she refused to talk to me. I tried to convince her that there was some unmentionable problem in my family because of which I couldn?t contact her but she broke off. I went back broken hearted and completed my studies and now I have a job and it has been 6 years since we had communicated. I contacted her again recently, she has forgotten me and its all my fault but I have not forgotten her after all these 12 years. She has committed to marry someone and has asked me not to call her again. Can you guide me so as what to do because I am unable to think of anyone but her. My parents all know this but can?t help me now for she is gone for ever. Can I pray to Allah for her return to me?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe fact that she has made it expressly clear that she does not wish to maintain any contact with her is sufficient for you to try and forget her. She is giving you a clear and obvious message that she is not interested.\n\nOur suggestion to you would be to divert your attention elsewhere. Make du?aa and beg Allah Ta?ala to assist you by providing someone far better than her. It?s not easy to forget but perhaps another Halaal relationship would enable you to focus your mind away from her.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
