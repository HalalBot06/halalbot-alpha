  "question": "My questions are regarding the subject of vows:",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) I made a promise to Allah to donate certain items in my possession to charity if I committed a specific sin. Regrettably, I committed the sin. Is it permissible for me to donate money (equal to or greater than the value of the items) to charity instead of the items themselves? As an example, let's say made a promise to Allah to donate one item of clothing to charity each time I lie. Then I lie. But instead of donating an item of clothing, I donate an amount of money equal to or greater than the value of clothing to charity. I am asking this because if I were to give the specific items to charity I would most likely go out and purchase the same items (i.e. matter of convenience to give money instead), and the charitable organization may find the money more useful than the specific items themselves. I consider giving money an equal or greater punishment than giving the specific items. If this is not permissible, please give the explanation(s). Also, is it still obligatory for me to feed or clothe 10 people (in addition to what was stipulated in the vow)? 2) In question number 4212 you stated that if one breaks his vow, it is cancelled. Does this also apply to the type of vow stated above. In other words, if one were to vow to Allah to do some good deed each time one commits a specific sin, must one continue to do this good deed each time one commits the sin, or is the vow cancelled/nullified after the first time the sin is committed? Jazak Allah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Upon violation of a vow of this nature, one has a choice, either to give\nKaffaarah for violation of oath or to fulfill the terms of his vow. In your\nsituation, to give the monetary value, as you have explained, will suffice\nas well. (Shaami Vol5 pg. 525 Maktaba Imdaadiyyah)\n2. This would depend on the wording of the specific vow. If the words used\nwere indicative of repetition e.g. 'every time' or 'each time' then one will\nhave to make good on the vow each time he commits the violation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
