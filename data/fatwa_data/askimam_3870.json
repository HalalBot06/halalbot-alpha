  "question": "About tafseers and hazrat dhul-kifl",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nassalaamu alaikum mufti saheb, 1) i would like to know why some classical tafseers are preferred over others , ie what is the criteria for rating the tafseers? for example how would you rate these less well known tafseers- baydaawi, tafseer al kabeer, ruhul ma'ani ? where can i find information on qadi al baydaawi? 2) who was hazrat dhul kifl?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. At the outset, one should understand that every Tafseer that is in%0D%0Aaccordance to Shari'ah and in accordance to the Ahaadith, narrations of the%0D%0ASahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum), and the pious predecessors is acceptable to%0D%0Aus. However, the criteria for giving preference to one over the other is:%0D%0Aa. The manner of presentation of a certain Mufassir in comparison to the%0D%0Aother.%0D%0Ab. The inclination of the reader of that particular Tafseer that a certain%0D%0AMufassir would make Tafseer, for example, predominantly with the laws of%0D%0ANahw and Sarf towards which the reader is inclined to as in the case of%0D%0ATafseer of Imaam Raazi (RA). This is in the same vein as to one's Ustaadhs%0D%0A(teacher) that a student, for example, prefer a certain Ustaadh over the%0D%0Aother which is not something that is in conflict with the Shari'ah. However,%0D%0AAdab, respect and honour should be upheld for each Mufassir or teacher, etc.%0D%0ABesides the above two reasons, there could be other reasons as well and this%0D%0Aall depends on the reader. To get more information on Tafseer, etc. we%0D%0Arecommend that you study 'Uloomul Qur'aan' by Mufti M Taqi Usmani Saheb of%0D%0APakistan.%0D%0Ac. Kindly refer to Zafar al-Muhassileen by Mawlana Muhammad Haneef.%0D%0Ad. You may also refer to Ma'aariful Qur'aan by Mawlana Mufti Muhammad Shafi,%0D%0Athe sixth volume pg.217; printed by Idaaratul Ma'aarif.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
