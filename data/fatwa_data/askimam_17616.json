  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAfter Sunday, i am now officially engaged. Both his and my parents are happy with this. Although we do not have a date yet, i would like to know on which days it would be best to have the wedding reception, my mother says that muslim people have wedding receptions on either Thursdays or Fridays, and Christian people have it on weekends. i have read that a wedding reception can last for longer periods, so how can it, according to my mother, be restricted to just an \"either or\" matter? She also says that choosing the date is my decision, yet she orders me to have it on either a Thursday or Friday. Is it wrong of me to want a wedding reception on a Sunday?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThe concept and practice of engagement is foreign to Islam.\n\nNikkah can be performed at any day and time of the week. It is however Mustahab to perform the Nikkah on a Friday. \n\n \n\nيستحب أن يكون النكاح ظاهرا وأن يكون قبله خطبة وأن يكون عقده في يوم الجمعة وأن يتولى عقده ولي رشيد وأن يكون بشهود عدول منها\n\n)البحر الرائق، 3/81، رشيديه)\n\n \n\nويندب إعلانه وتقديم خطبة وكونه في مسجد يوم جمعة بعاقد رشيد وشهود عدول\n\n(رد المحتار، 3/8، سعيد)\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMl.
