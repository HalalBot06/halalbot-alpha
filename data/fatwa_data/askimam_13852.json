  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nwho was the first one to live on earth? how were they born? who were they?\n\ndid Allah use his powers to create something or someone scientifically? do u know what happened in the past? that`s all I want to know about the past of Allah`s and our past.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nNabi Aadam (alayhis salaam) and his wife Hawwaa (alayhas salaam) were the first to live on this earth. Nabi Aadam (alayhis salaam) was created directly by Allah Ta’ala, without having a mother, nor being born. Allah Ta’ala created and fashioned him from clay, and then blew life into this clay form. Hawwaa (alayhas salaam) was created from the rib of Nabi Aadam (alayhis salaam).\n\nKindly ask your niece what she understands from the term \"scientifically\".\n\nWe do not have much information about the time before Nabi Aadam (alayhis salaam). The Qur’aan and Hadith mention very little about this. As far as the history of man on earth, we have the incidents of a few Ambiyaa (prophets) (Alayhimus Salaam) recorded in the Qur’aan and Hadith. Also, as a lesson, the stories of a few obedient, and many disobedient nations have been related.\n\nTime itself is a creation of Allah Ta’ala. Hence it is inconceivable to think of a past, present or future in respect to Allah Ta’ala. Allah Ta’ala is above and beyond these created entities. In brief, we accept what Allah Ta’ala has told us about himself, but as created beings it will always be impossible for us to fully comprehend Allah Ta’ala.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala knows best.\n\nMl. E.
