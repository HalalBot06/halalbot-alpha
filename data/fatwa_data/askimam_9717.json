  "answer": "QUESTION\nShould/can I destroy a large idol of Buhdda that my world religions teacher has placed in my classroom?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe classroom does not belong to you and you do not enjoy control over it either. Hence, you are not responsible for what the teacher places within the confines of the classroom.\n\nYou are not allowed to destroy the idol in this classroom. We suggest you very politely approach the teacher requesting him to remove or conceal this idol as it offends your religious sentiments.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
