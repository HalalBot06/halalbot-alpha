  "question": "Can i give Zakaat to my step mom?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nA unique situation has arised, my late father-in-laws 2nd wife has taken ill. this is not my wifes mother. he has one sibling from her and they still mantain relationships with my wife and her sisters. however the mother in law has taken ill and the medical bills have exceed R25000.00 and we paid a portion from our pockets basing it on the fact that its our duty. however my wifes one sister wishes to contibute, but wants to take the opinion that the funds can be taken from either zakaat / sadka etc. my \"mother-in-law\" is financially not in a position to cover her bills, and taking her situation into consideration, no one else would cover her expenses. however I feel that the funds from zakaat/sadka are \"ethically & islamically\" wrong. i would like some guidance to pass onto the family.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIn principle, a step-mother is not equivalent to ones biological mother. If zakat is given to her, the zakat will be discharged. She will be the owner of the money and could pay for her expenses. She does not have to be told that zakat is being given to her.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
