  "question": "We a muslim boy and girl,love each other and were physically involved.we want to get married soon.But, our parents are not ready for our marrige. Can we get married against our parents wishes?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, we wish to inform you that it is prohibited to have any contact with a stranger (Ghayr Mahram) of the opposite sex.\n\nMarriage is a huge step in one?s life. The implications of not following correct procedures may have disastrous and lasting effects. It is our humble opinion you communicate your intention to your parents or someone influential who may convince them. Should they still refuse, and you have the fear of committing sin and you cannot exercise restraint, according to Shari?ah, you may marry the person without the consent of your parents.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
