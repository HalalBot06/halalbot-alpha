  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI wanted to know whether if a fiance when he is maktoob el kteb to a girl is it permissible for him to see her hair if she is wearing the scarf?please reply as soon as possible.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nYour query is not clear. According to our understanding of your query, you wish to propose to a girl and you wish to see her hair. If our understanding is correct, then the ruling of Shariah is:\n\nIf a person wishes to see a girl for marriage, then he may see her face only. He cannot see her hair. Once a proposal has been accepted, then too it is not permissible to see each other until marriage has taken place.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
