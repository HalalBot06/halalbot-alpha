  "question": "Further to my question 9451 from Kuwait Re: Subject: Parents Demands Regarding Wife",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMufti Sahib, Assalamu Alaikum, With reference to your below mentioned Fatwas (question 94519451from Kuwait Re: Subject: Parents Demands Regarding Wife) I request you to kindly explain the following: There is no denying that husband is the guardian of wife and parents have no Shara?ee right whatsoever. However it looks like you have missed the essence of the question, i.e. ?Joint Family?. The question is if in an Islamic society, it is permissible to live in a Joint Family? If your answer to above question is ?NO? then your Fatwa is absolutely right. But if your answer to above question is yes, then there are complications. Since Islam strongly advocates to have a leader or ?Amir? and naturally the ?Head Of Family? will be the leader or the Amir of the family. The person who has asked you for Fatwa does not seem to be the ?Head Of Family?. If every member of the family starts taking there own decisions then there will not be any joint family at all. I think for this reason only, Islam has advised to have ?Shoora? and or consultation. In second Para of your Fatwa, you have advised to send the women to their parents for first delivery. Is this a Fatwa or your advice? You have not substantiated your Fatwa with any verse of Quran or supported it with an authentic hadeeth. Could you please give your evidence? I hope you will be kind enough to reply to my above queries. Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly tell us your concept of joint family; families living together or families making one unified decision but living separately.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
