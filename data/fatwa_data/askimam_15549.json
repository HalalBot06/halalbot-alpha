  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf is ok to read quran from internet at work, but don’t have wudu because its difficult some times to perform wudu at work or keep wudu at work all times.\n\n \nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThere are two issues in your query\n\n  \n\n1. Reading Quran from the Internet.\n2. Reading Quran at work.\n\n  \n\nIn principle, one may read the Quran online. It is not necessary to be in the state of wudhu when reading the Quran. The issue of reading the Quran at work is different. During working hours, an employee is required to fulfill his employment duties. The time at work is the rights off the employer for which he pays his employee. The employee cannot use that time for his personal work including reading the Quran without prior consent from the employer. Not withstanding the virtues of the Quran, to read the Quran during employment will be violating the rights of the employer which is a sin.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
