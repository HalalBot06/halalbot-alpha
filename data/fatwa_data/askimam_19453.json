  "answer": "QUESTION\nWho is responsible for the dowry and the wedding costs? If the bride refuses to consummate marriage who is responsible for the dowry and wedding costs? The bride refused to let her husband touch her for two months. He tried but she did not let him.  Her father took her away from her husband’s house still a virgin. \nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nIn principle, the payment of the dowry is the sole responsibility of the husband.[i]  Dowry becomes binding by the contracting of nikah itself. \n\nEvery person is unique.  Some find certain tasks easy whereas others find it difficult.  The husband and wife should communicate and discuss their personal issues.  The husband should try and understand the wife.  She may be fearing something or be very shy.  Nevertheless, all parties involved must resolve the situation in a cordial manner.  If there is any difficulty in understanding one another, you may consult one who is an expert in this field. \n \nPlease elaborate on the wedding costs you are referring to.    \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Faraz Ibn Adam,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\nUK\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net\n\n\n\n\n[i]  اعلم أن المهر يجب على الزوج للزوجة شرعا بمجرد العقد (الأحكام الشرعية في الأحوال الشخصية ج1 ص195 دار السلام)"
