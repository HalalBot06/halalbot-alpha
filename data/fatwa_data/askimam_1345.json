  "question": "Are women allowed education upto degree level?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have met many women at university who wear full hijab and say that the people who say women are not allowed out of the house but should remain at home and do the cooking, cleaning, washing and sewing is wrong, cos if men are allowed to study women also desire education, to learn something like our Prophets(pbuh) wife (pbuh)who use to teach other people.Some women dont like to sew clothes cos its tiring and boring. There would be complaints from men if they were told to stay at home to do the house work cos they are human beings like women. they both have a brain and heart. please explain this matter but do not tell me to visit this or that site which i have done.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen Women Emerge%0D%0Aby Madrasah Ta'leemuddeen - Isipingo Beach%0D%0A%0D%0ANo Muslim has the slightest iota of doubt in the fact that the Qur'an is%0D%0Aabsolutely infallible. How could it be otherwise when the Qur'an is the word%0D%0Aof Allah Ta'ala who is All Knowing, All Seeing and the possessor of absolute%0D%0Aand perfect wisdom. Every command of Allah Ta'ala is compatible with human%0D%0Anature and its adherence not only earns a person rewards in the hereafter,%0D%0Abut is also vital to facilitate the smooth harmony of our existence on%0D%0Aearth. No system or mode of life can ever be superior. Allah Ta'ala, the%0D%0ACreator of men and women, the Eternal Being that blessed mankind with%0D%0Aintellect and the One who created in human beings passions, emotions and%0D%0Adesires, addresses His female slaves in His Glorious Qur'an with the%0D%0Afollowing command: \"And remain firmly within your homes and display not%0D%0Ayourselves like the display of the former times of ignorance\"(Al-Ahzaab;%0D%0A33). This is the command of none other than our Creator, Allah the Most%0D%0AWise. Hence by disregarding this command we will not only invite His%0D%0Adispleasure, but we will also have to suffer the terrible consequences of%0D%0Aour violation in this world. It will be similar to the case where a person%0D%0Aignores the instructions of the manufacturer of a car and he fills water%0D%0Ainto the petrol tank and fills petrol into the radiator.%0D%0A%0D%0AABSOLUTE NECESSITY%0D%0A%0D%0ALikewise Rasulullah (Sallallaahu layhi Wasallam) has restricted the%0D%0Aemergence of women from the home to the situation of genuine necessity. Ibn%0D%0AUmar (RA.) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam said: 'A%0D%0Awoman should not emerge from her home except if she is forced to do so\"%0D%0A(Tabrani). Also when emerging out of necessity, the woman is commanded to%0D%0Aadopt full Hijaab, which includes the covering of her face.%0D%0AHowever in the present climate of women's lib and feminism which has risen%0D%0Afrom the decadent west, even Muslims of weak Imaan have found it appropriate%0D%0Ato cast women out of their homes and into the outside world. Yet do we%0D%0Areally know what goes on out there? The situation is indeed shocking to say%0D%0Athe least.%0D%0A%0D%0AWOMEN RETURNING HOME%0D%0A%0D%0AAccording to the American Psychological Association sexual harassment is%0D%0Aextremely widespread in the work place. \"It touches the lives of 40 to 60%0D%0Apercent of working women, and a similar proportion of female students in%0D%0Acolleges and universities. In Texas, for example, after having been cast out%0D%0Aof the home, the women finally want to return to their rightful place.%0D%0AAccording to an article in the Texas Poll (21%2F2%2F93), one third of all Texas%0D%0Awomen have experienced sexual harassment at work. According to the article%0D%0A\"more than half said the incidents contributed to them leaving their jobs or%0D%0Awanting to.\"%0D%0AIndeed the outside world has become a jungle. Here again, let the statistics%0D%0Aof the west speak for themselves.%0D%0AResearch conducted in August 1990 revealed that 1 in 4 college women have%0D%0Abeen attacked by a rapist and 1 in 7 have been raped. This should be%0D%0Aconsidered together with the fact that only 7% of all rapes are reported to%0D%0Athe police and more than 50% of the victims do not tell anybody about their%0D%0Aordeal . Thus these figures are only the tip of the ice-berg. (A%0D%0ACriminological Study; Koss and Woodruff).%0D%0A%0D%0AENDANGERED SPECIES%0D%0A%0D%0ABesides the above, due to the free intermingling of men and women in the%0D%0Awork place and elsewhere, it seems that legitimate children are becoming an%0D%0Aendangered species, especially in the U.S. as well as in other countries. In%0D%0Athe article titled \"The Truth About Feminism,\" Kenneth R. Pangborn writes%0D%0Athat \"in the United States one child in four is illegitimate (1 in 3 in%0D%0AFlorida).\" Also in those children born out-of-wedlock, more than 50% have%0D%0Abirth certificates where the father is described as \"unknown\"!%0D%0APerhaps some readers may feel that all this is very far away in the U.S..%0D%0AHence it should not concern us. Actually we should be extremely concerned.%0D%0AIn South Africa SEVEN OUT OF TEN (70%) women encounter sexual abuse in the%0D%0Aworking world (Natal on Saturday 25%2F3%2F95).%0D%0AYes, it is a reality, though in most cases the victims never mention it to%0D%0Aanyone. According to a survey carried out by the Student Counselling Centre%0D%0A(SCC) at the University of Natal (Durban), \"of these incidents (of sexual%0D%0Aharassment) as many as 80% are not reported.\" Rather, the victims would even%0D%0Adeny it, for fear of reprisals.%0D%0A%0D%0AUNIVERSITIES%0D%0A%0D%0ASimilarly, \"academic\" institutions also paint a horrid picture. The SCC%0D%0Areport states that a survey at Rhodes University revealed that 63% of female%0D%0Aacademics experienced sexual harassment. Also out of one hundred students%0D%0Asurveyed at Rhodes, six said that they had been 'offered higher marks for%0D%0Asexual favours.' The report also states that at the University of Natal%0D%0A(Durban) \"one in four females reported experiencing sexual harassment%0D%0A`occasionally' (which means that though it does not occur frequently, it%0D%0Ahappens on an on going basis).\"%0D%0A%0D%0APARLIAMENT%0D%0A%0D%0ALet alone in other places of work, even the highest office in the country%0D%0Ahas not escaped the sexual harassment of women. According to a Daily News%0D%0Areport (9%2F12%2F94) \"several women MPs and parliamentary staff have complained%0D%0Aof sexual harassment by male MPs.\" The report quoted the speaker of%0D%0Aparliament as saying that the alleged perpetrators were \"from more than one%0D%0Aparty.\" It was also reported that women MPs feared going to certain parts of%0D%0Athe parliamentary complex.%0D%0A%0D%0AWOEFUL DAY%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen this is the situation in the highest office of the country, what can be%0D%0Asaid of elsewhere? Yet, despite this shocking state of affairs, many Muslims%0D%0Astill ignore the injunctions of the Qur'an and actually propagate that women%0D%0Ashould be working \"shoulder-to-shoulder\" with men. Numerous Muslim girls%0D%0Ahave married men who are out of the fold of Islam due to the contact that%0D%0Adeveloped in high schools, universities and in the work place. All the%0D%0Aparents of these girls were adamant that \"My daughter will never do such a%0D%0Athing.\" That woeful day however came when they had to swallow hard on these%0D%0Awords and wash it down with a flood of tears - but to no avail. The apple of%0D%0Atheir eye had become the wife of some John, Peter or Reddy.%0D%0ANonetheless, the most baffling part is that in spite of many of these%0D%0Aaspects being common knowledge, numerous parents continue to send their%0D%0Adaughters to high schools, universities, and into the working world. When%0D%0Athese parents are spoken to with regards to the Imaan-snatching dangers out%0D%0Athere, their simple response is: \"My daughter will never do such a thing.\"%0D%0AThe problem however is that in the \"melting pot\" environments of the outside%0D%0Aworld, only those with Imaan as firm as mountains can withstand the%0D%0Aonslaught. Simply no rationalizations whatsoever can sanction women being%0D%0Acast into the lion's den.%0D%0A%0D%0ADISTRIBUTION OF WORK%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala has given us the beautiful formula compatible with the%0D%0Adiffering natures of the genders. This is illustrated in the following%0D%0Apractice of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu layhi Wasallam) had apportioned the work%0D%0Athat pertains to matters outside the home (which includes earning for the%0D%0Afamily) to Sayyidina Ali %7BRA.) while the work pertaining to aspects inside%0D%0Athe home were allotted to the Queen of Jannah, Hazrath Fatima (RA.) (Zaadul%0D%0AMa'aad 2%2F235). Hence it is the man's duty to go out into the world and earn%0D%0Aa Halaal living. Thus in a truly Islamic state where women are not found%0D%0Aworking \"shoulder-to-shoulder\" with men, the root cause of the illicit%0D%0Aliaisons which take place in the working world will be non existent.%0D%0AHowever, when that ideal situation does not exist, the man who goes out to%0D%0Awork must be extra cautious to protect himself. Allah Ta'ala says: \"Say to%0D%0Athe Believing men that they should lower their gazes (An-Noor: 30).\" Also%0D%0Athe Hadith clearly states that 'no person should ever be in seclusion with a%0D%0Astrange woman. When these and other similar injunctions will be violated%0D%0Athen the obvious outcome will be involvement in grievous sins. The solution%0D%0Ais thus to eliminate the cause, not to light the fire and then attempt to%0D%0Acontrol it.%0D%0AIndeed, we are living in difficult times. While numerous women venture out%0D%0Ainto the world merely to maintain a high standard of living, some venture%0D%0Aout only to earn their mere daily bread. Hence if it is necessary, Islam has%0D%0Anot forbidden a woman from earning. However, it is incumbent that All the%0D%0Alaws of the Shari'ah be upheld. Among other aspects, of utmost importance is%0D%0Athat she may not expose herself to non-Mahram males (men to whom marriage is%0D%0Apermissible%7D. She should also have sufficient time for her domestic%0D%0Aactivities and for the caring of her children.%0D%0A%0D%0AINCULCATING DEEN%0D%0A%0D%0AA woman has a great duty to discharge at home. The upbringing of her%0D%0Achildren require her full attention. Unfortunately, \"upbringing\" to a great%0D%0Aextent has come to mean clothing, feeding and attending to the other%0D%0Aphysical necessities of the child. This is however, the necessary but less%0D%0Aimportant part of upbringing. The more important part is the inculcating of%0D%0ADeen in the life of the child and embedding the correct morals, character%0D%0Aand etiquette in that innocent soul. This is more than a full-time job. When%0D%0Amothers fulfilled this duty (obviously with the father also playing his%0D%0Arole), the Imaam Razis and Ghazzalis were constantly produced. The same is%0D%0Apossible today - if we get our priorities in order.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala give us the correct understanding of Deen and enable us to%0D%0Apractice upon ALL His injunctions, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0AAl-Haadi Vol. 3 Issue No. 6%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A"
