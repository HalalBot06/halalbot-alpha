  "question": "Is it permissable to acquire telkom shares??Even if they deal in a permissable product their monies are kept in call accounts which earn a high rate of interest which will be distributed as profit.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible to acquire Telkom shares. However, since part of the dividends is made up of interest, a proportionate percentage of the profit or dividend will be Haraam.
