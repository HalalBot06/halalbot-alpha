  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDear Respected Brother. Is it true that only Muslims will enter Jannah? If so,what about the followers of the previous prophets whom Allah sent before our Nabee-e kareem (S.A.W)? What was their faults? Should they not be rewarded for having been good disciples?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nEvery Prophet (alayhis salam) was a Muslim (submitted to Allah's orders) and their righteous followers were also Muslims - as is clear from the following Quranic verses:\n\n \n\nAnd We sent not before you any messenger except that We revealed to him that:\n\n“There is no deity except Me, so worship Me.”\n\n(Surah al-Anbiya, Verse 25)\n\n \n\nBut when Isa felt [persistence in] disbelief from them, he said, “Who are my supporters for [the cause of] Allah?” The disciples said, “We are supporters for Allah. We have believed in Allah and testify that we are Muslims [submitting to Him].”\n\n(Surah Aal-Imran, Verse 52)\n\n \n\nNuh (alayhis salam) says:\n\nAnd if you turn away [from my advice] then no payment have I asked of you. My reward is only from Allah, and I have been commanded to be of the Muslims.”\n\n(Surah Yunus, Verse 72)\n\n \n\nAnd Musa said, “O my people, if you have believed in Allah, then rely upon Him,\nif you should be Muslims.”\n\n(Surah Yunus, Verse 84)\n\n \n\nAnd Ibrahim instructed his sons [to do the same] and [so did] Yaqub, [saying],\n“O my sons, indeed Allah has chosen for you this religion, so do not die except while you are Muslims.”\nOr were you witnesses when death approached Yaqub, when he said to his sons, “What will you worship after me?” They said, “We will worship your God and the God of your fathers, Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq - one God. And we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.”\n\n(Surah al-Baqarah, Verses 132-133)\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
