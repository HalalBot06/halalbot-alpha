  "answer": "QUESTION\nI realised a couple of months ago that it is Haram to communicate in any form to one's fiancee. I have put myself in a compromising situation because the girl lives in India and i told her i would phone/write to her which i have been doing for several months but now i'm fearful of what her response would be should i tell her what i have found out. My worries are how this will affect our relationship and what her reaction will be. Please advise Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWrite a letter explaining to her the situation in detail. Insha-Allah if she\nis a Deeni lady she will appreciate your concern for your Deen and will\nrespect you further for it. This Insha-Allah will create more love and\nrespect in your marriage.\n\nDo not delay the Nikah unnecessarily.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
