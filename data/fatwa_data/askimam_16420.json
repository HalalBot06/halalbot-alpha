A marriage should be an open matter and announced to at least the members of the community. Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wassalam) said, “Announce the nikah”. If a husband conceals the marriage, the wife is placed in a very uncomfortable situation. She will have to conduct herself as thought she is unmarried while in reality she is. This is unfair to the woman while the husband enjoys the comfort of her companionship. In the circumstances, the wife’s insistence on divorce is understandable.\n\n2)  If the husband issued the divorce unwillingly, then too it is valid.\n\n3&4 )If the wife requested Khula and the husband verbally agreed to the Khula unwillingly, then too it will be valid. That will constitute as one Talaq-e-Bain.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
