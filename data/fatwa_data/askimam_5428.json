  "question": "Is it shameful for an unmarried muslim teenager to be curious about Islam's view on sex ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs salaamu Alaikum Respected Mufti Taking into consideration that sex is a fact of life , is it shameful for an unmarried Muslim teenager to be curious about it and Islam's view on it? Isn't it better to eduacate Muslim teenagers in the Islamic viewpoint rather than they receiving distorted and unislamic infomation from their friends.Isn't it the duty of the parent to impart such knowledge? Jazakallh for the Masha Allah site Was salaam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt will be the duty of a Muslim parent to educate his%2Fher teenage child on%0D%0Amatters pertaining to the child's deen and not necessarily the intimate%0D%0Athings of life. Whe the parent notices that the young teenager is at the age%0D%0Aof maturity then with tact and wisdom the parent should explain the Islaamic%0D%0Ainjunctions and laws which will now apply to the child. For example, the%0D%0Ateenager should be made to understand that the removing of pubic hairs is%0D%0Anecessary and that after a nocturnal emmission, a compulsory bath will have%0D%0Ato be taken and the different rulings applying to young girls who will be%0D%0Aexperiencing menstruation.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis will be sufficient for a parent to explain to his%2Fher teenage child.%0D%0AMore than this is not totally necessary unless the child has to ask or the%0D%0Aparent feels a need to explain such intimate things. Also, one should note%0D%0Athat between parent and child there should exist a certain degree of shame%0D%0Aand modesty. This is desired between a parent and child relationship or else%0D%0Athere will be no sense of respect for the parent which could be detrimental%0D%0Afor the nurturing and imbibement of good qualities and etiquette in the%0D%0Achild. If modesty and shame is prevlent in the parent%2Fshild relationship%0D%0Athen such an explicit discussion will be quiet strange and uncomfortable.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs time goes on in a teenager's life, gradually he%2Fshe will learn the facts%0D%0Aof life as this system prevailed from before till now.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
