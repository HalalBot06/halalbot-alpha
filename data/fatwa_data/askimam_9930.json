  "answer": "QUESTION\nIve read two books by the same author, in the ghusul book he states that whudu does not have to be made after ghusul but in the wudu book he states that wudu must be made after ghusul. Also is there any fathwa regarding fishing (for recreational use) during the month of ramadaan?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is not necessary to make Wudhu after Ghusl. (Hidaaya).\n\n2. It is permissible to fish during Ramadhaan. However, one should use this blessed time in making Ibaadaat and getting closer to Allah Ta?ala.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
