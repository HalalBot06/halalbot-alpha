  "question": "Is it permissible to watch these movies as a stimulant before intercourse?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nÂ have read your fatwa/views on pornography and regarding the use of sex toys between lawfully married couples. However, my wife and I have a different problem. After many years of marriage and a few kids, we no longer feel sexually attracted towards one another (our physical bodies and shapes no longer look attractive). My wife does not like sex toys, neither do I. However, the urge for sex is present and both of us feel very stimulated when we watch softcore erotic movies (not hard pornography). Is it permissible to watch these movies as a stimulant before intercourse? If not, please propose a lawful alternative according to Islamic law and jurisprudence. JazakAllah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is not permissibleto watch movies to stimulate yourselves.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
