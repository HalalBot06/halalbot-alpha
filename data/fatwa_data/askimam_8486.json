  "answer": "QUESTION\nThere have been many politics at our masjid the shuyukh have been fired etc... is it recommended to talk about this with people involved in the masjid not being sure whether it will make a difference or not?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Masjid is the house of Allah and it is everyone?s responsibility to keep it inhabited and free from every type of arguments and fights therefore you should make an effort to end the politics in the Masjid and discuss about the politics in the masjid with the responsible people (Mutawallis).\n\nIf they accept your suggestions then well and good and Allah Ta?ala will reward you. If they do not accept your suggestion then you should still continue making an effort to end it and also advise them time and again. One day, Insha-Allah, Allah will instil the correct thing in their hearts.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf\nDarul Ifta ?
