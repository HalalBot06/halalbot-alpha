  "question": "Did Working in Foreign Development Projects in a Muslim Country is permissible? UNICEF, UNHCR, UNDP, World Bank, USAID etc",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nReference my previous question # 6433. You need more detail. There are several projects funded by UNICEF, UNHCR, UNDP, World Bank, USAID etc. are running in Pakistan. The purpose of these projects is the development of Pakistan. The funds are mainly used in Health, Education, and Social Sector. Most of these projects are under loan agreement and heavy mark up is involved on the Government level. My question is based on the fact that the sources of these funds are unknown. These funds may be generated through interest by the western countries. I hope you can understand the question.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou have raised the issue of 'source of funds' for these projects. From that%0D%0Aangle we do not see any problem. It would be permissible for you to provide%0D%0Aa service, and receive remuneration from any of these organisations. This%0D%0Awill apply even though they may have acquired their funds through interest.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever the aspect which has to be considered is the type of service that%0D%0Ayou are going to provide. There is no hiding the fact that all the%0D%0Aorganisations mentioned by you are involved in projects designed to destroy%0D%0AIslam and the Muslims. They have sinister agendas in even the charitable%0D%0Aworks that they are doing. By you providing them your services, you will be%0D%0Aaiding them in sin. The Qur'aan states: \"And do not assist one another in%0D%0Asin and rebellion\".%0D%0A%0D%0AIf however, the particular service you provide them with does not promote%0D%0Atheir evil objectives, then you may undertake such projects for them. In%0D%0Asuch a case too, it would be better to abstain.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Imraan Vawda%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
