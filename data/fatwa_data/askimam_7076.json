  "question": "Is there any DUA that a wife can recite to make her husband stop visiting prohibited places.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Instead of searching for a Du?aa, why doesn?t the wife determine the underlying cause for her husband visiting prohibited places? Perhaps she is lacking in her duties towards him which subsequently leads him to pursue pleasure elsewhere?\n\n2. Perform 2 Rakaats of Salaatul Haajat and make Du?aa for him after Salaat in any language you prefer.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
