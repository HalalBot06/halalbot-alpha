  "answer": "QUESTION\nI read an article that reading Salaah with glasses may not be permissible. Is there any truth to this article! The reference was with regard to gold and silve frames but also mentioned copper and alloy frames\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nRespected Brother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nAssalamu alaukum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh\n\n \n\nIt is not permissible in Salah or out of Salah for males to wear glasses with gold, silver or copper frames.If the frames are not gold, silver or copper, but are only plated in those colours, then it is permissible.\n\n \n\nIt is permissible for females to wear gold and silver glasses.Copper frames are not permissible for woman as well.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala knows best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\nThe guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\nEducation and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\nIslam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\nWhen one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\nMuslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\nWe have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\nIf you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\nIf that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\nRasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit”.\n\n \n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
