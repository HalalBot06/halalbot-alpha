  "answer": "QUESTION\nCould you find me a hadith which has something about this my uncle says there is a hadith about it but I havnt found 1 so I was hoping you would. Is their a hadith which says you should follow your sense and logic and the country you live in. it is unclear to me.this is an example ?interest is haraam? but if you lived in a country and interest is a big thing their and you cant stop it then you hav to use your common sense and logic on how you are going to use it.could you please find me a hadith which has something about this and also try and make this clearer for me to understand.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe are unable to locate such a Hadith.\n\nThese are the ideologies of one of the deviated sects. They believe whatever in the Shari?ah which conforms with our logic we will accept, and whatever is contrary to our logic we will reject. Interest is prohibited by Allah Ta?ala in the Qur?aan. No one has the authority to overrule the decree of Allah and follow his weak and inconsistent logic.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
