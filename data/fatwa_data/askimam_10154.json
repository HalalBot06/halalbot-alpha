  "question": "In sitting for Sunnat Etikaaf are you allowed to join a congregation for Janaza Namaaz? If not why?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMay Allah reward you for all your good work and sharing your knowledge.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJanaza salah is performed outside the musjid proper. It is not permissible to come out of the musjid during I'tikaf without a human need for example, answering the call of nature. Janaza salah does not fall in this category.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
