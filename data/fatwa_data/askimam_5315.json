  "question": "waht does it mean when two people do istikhaara and one gets a positive answer and one gets a negative answer?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFirstly, let it be known that the results of the Istikhaarah are not Yaqeeni\n(absolute).\n\nTaking this principle into account, it is possible for people to get\nconflicting responses to their respective Istikhaaras. In the case of the\naforementioned question, he may repeat the Istikhaara. Assuming that the\nperson who got a positive answer feels that the other person's Istikhaarais\nmore superior and reliable, he may accept the other person's Istikhaara and\nreject his own. Insha Allah, he will not be held to task for contravening\nhis Istikhaara as this is not based on 'Ilmul Yaqeen' (absolute knowledge).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
