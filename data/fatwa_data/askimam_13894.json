  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf a person smile or laughs with a loud voice in salaat then is that salaat accepted?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf one laughs out loud in Salaat such that the person next to him can hear him, the Salaat is null and void and his Wudhu breaks. One will have to repeat Wudhu and Salaat. If one merely smiles without laughing, then neither does the Wudhu nor Salaat break. (Raddul Muhtaar vol.1 pg.144; HM Saeed)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
