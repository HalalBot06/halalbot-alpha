  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWe are Planning ot start a construction business. While starting that we will have to give a please for bank in our office to provide loans because customer will be interested to buy flats only if they get loans . So i would like to know is it permisible for us to give them a please in our office or to deal with them in this field etc or is there any other options ..\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe general ruling regarding allowing the bank to use one’s property is:\n\nIf the bank is allowed to use the premises for free, then it will not be permissible, as there will be a direct involvement of the property in Haraam.\nIf the bank is allowed to use the premises on rent, then it will be Makrooh (undesirable), because, although the property is not directly involved in Haraam, yet the bank is being assisted by renting the property to them.\nIf one has designed the property to suit the purpose of banking, and his sole object was to facilitate banks, then giving out the property on rent to the bank will be Makrooh Tahrimi (close to Haraam).\n\nJawahirul Fiqh Vol:2 Pg:457-462 (Maktabah Darul Uloom Karachi)\n\nIn the situation mentioned in the query, besides indirectly assisting the bank by providing a place, you are also directly assisting the bank, by providing them customers, etc. In this way the business will play a major role in the Haraam earnings of the bank. This type of assistance to Haraam is not permissible in Shariah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nM. Jawed Iqbal,\n\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
