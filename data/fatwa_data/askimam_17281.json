The nikah has terminated and your cousin and her ex-husband cannot live as husband and will. Your cousin will have to observe her iddat of three menses is she is experiencing menses and she is not conceived. After the iddat she may marry anyone else besides her ex-husband.\n\n \n\nIf she remarries and the marriage is consummated and the second husband divorces her, then only she may remarry after the iddat of the divorce of the second marriage. This is called halalah. It is not permissible to arrange halalah to merely make it permissible for the ex-wife to marry her ex-husband.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
