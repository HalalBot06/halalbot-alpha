  "question": "O Muhammed, through your intermediary do i set my face towards my Lord......\"??? What is this 'O Muhammed' in this supplication? is this not shirk? ... refer Hisn Haseen",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nthere is a dua to recite after 'Salatul Hajaat' included by Allama Jazri(r.h) ..the translation is \"O Allah, while setting my face towards You i beg You through the intermdeiary of Muhammed (sallahu alahai wasallam), ........O Muhammed, through your intermediary do i set my face towards my Lord......\"??? What is this 'O Muhammed' in this supplication? is this not shirk? (refer Hisnul Haseen - Darul Ishaat 1993 ed.)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe abovementioned Du'aa has been misinterpreted.\n\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) himself commanded this Sahaabi\n(Radhiallaahu Anhu) to make the Du'aa and to use the intermediary of himself\n(Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)). This is not Shirk. Nabi\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was alive and the Sahaabi was not asking Nabi\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) directly for any need. The Sahaabi was merely\nusing the blessed name of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) as an\nintermediary.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
