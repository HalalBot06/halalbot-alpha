As a matter of urgency, try to identify some pious people in your vicinity and try to keep their company.\n\nIf there is some pious Aalim close to you, establish contact with him and take guidance from him. This is an emergency, and you need help quick. Delaying may cause the situation to reach a point of no return.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
