  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalum aleikum,\n\nI have been diagnosed with diabetes (Type II) this past year. I am 45 y of age.\n\nMy Doctor recommended to me to have small amounts of food during the day (up to 6 times a day). Small portions spread during the day in order not to give rise to my blood sugar.\n\nThis my first Ramadan that I feel I will not do if I follow my doctor's recommendation (and by the way I didn't follow her advise since I have been fasting for the past 2 days). I am a bit lost and I want to ask you sir what I should do?\n\nI feel I can do it but then I am not sure if I am not going to pay for this later (i.e., bad consequences on my health) by not following my doctor's advise.\n\nJazakum allah khayraa\n\nMT\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nYou should consult your doctor again and explain your religious obligation of fasting. If the doctor feels that you may fast and your medication be adjusted accordingly then well and good.\n\nIf the doctor advises that fasting will be extremely detrimental to your health and there is no adequate alternative, then it will be permissible for you not to fast. You will have to make Qadha of your missed fasts later if you can. If you cannot make Qadha for your missed fasts, then you will have to give Fidya (Compensation) for each missed fast. The amount of Fidya is the amount of Sadaqatul Fitr (Zakatul Fitr) in your area.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
