  "question": "Kindly interpret this dream for me.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIt was Thursday night when I slept and saw this dream where I am looking out of my home balcony facing the garden. And I see a rope that has been tied horizontally where one end meets the terrace and the other end is coming from somewhere beyond the house boundary. I see an elephant cross the rope, and then I see three black coloured animals one behind another also cross and indicate it to one of my relatives who also sees only the black animals. That's all i can remember. I have heard that seeing the rope in a dream holds some significance. Can you please interpret this for me. Jazakallah Khayr.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe rope symbolizes Islam. The elephant, foreigners and non-Muslims who are\ncrossing the boundaries of Islam and the animals are the allies of the\nforeign invaders.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
