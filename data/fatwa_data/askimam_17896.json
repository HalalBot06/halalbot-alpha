  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIt is permissible for a women to wear Kohl in public? Is it also permissible for her to wear little foundation to clear any blemishes on her face when she goes out in public?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nAllah Ta'ala says in the Holy Quran:\n\n \n\nقل للمؤمنين يغضوا من أبصارهم ويحفظوا فروجهم ذلك أزكى لهم إن الله خبير بما يصنعون   وقل للمؤمنات يغضضن من أبصارهن ويحفظن فروجهن ولا يبدين زينتهن إلا ما ظهر منها وليضربن بخمرهن على جيوبهن ولا يبدين زينتهن إلا لبعولتهن أو آبائهن أو آباء بعولتهن أو أبنائهن أو أبناء بعولتهن أو إخوانهن أو بني إخوانهن أو بني أخواتهن أو نسائهن أو ما ملكت أيمانهن أو التابعين غير أولي الإربة من الرجال أو الطفل الذين لم يظهروا على عورات النساء ولا يضربن بأرجلهن ليعلم ما يخفين من زينتهن وتوبوا إلى الله جميعا أيها المؤمنون لعلكم تفلحون\n\n\"Tell the believing men that they must lower their gazes and guard their private parts; it is more decent for them. Surely Allah is All-Aware of what they do. And tell the believing women that they must lower their gazes and guard their private parts, and must not expose their adornment, except that which appears thereof, and must wrap their bosoms with their shawls, and must not expose their adornment, except to their husbands or their fathers or the fathers of their husbands, or to their sons or the sons of their husbands, or to their brothers or the sons of their brothers or the sons of their sisters, or to their women, or to those owned by their right hands, or male attendants having no (sexual) urge, or to the children who are not yet conscious of the shames of women. And let them not stamp their feet in a way that the adornment they conceal is known. And repent to Allah O believers, all of you, so that you may achieve success\". (24:30-31)\n\n \n\nIt is not permissible for a woman to wear kohl or foundation in public places. These are considered a means of adornment. They will only be permissible to be applied for the pleasure of her husband or in front of mahrams as is clearly stated in the abovementioned verse. Moreover, in these times of fitnah, it is necessary for a woman to observe full hijab anyway if she is in any public place.\n\n(Ahsan al-Fatawa, 8/71, HM Saeed)\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
