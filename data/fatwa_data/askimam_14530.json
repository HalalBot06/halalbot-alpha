  "question": "If I wear a t-shirt with a picture of a fantasy cartoon creature that doesn’t exist then it is permissible. Is this correct?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease clarify regarding the subject of moorat. (pictures of animate objects on clothing etc)\n\n1) I have been told that it is only haraam to wear clothes with pictures of animate objects that exist. E.g.  Animals, people etc. If I wear a t-shirt with a picture of a fantasy cartoon creature that doesn’t exist then it is permissible. Is this correct?\n\n2) People also say that it is permissible to wear clothing with pictures where no eyes are visible, i.e. the face or body of an animal or person is visible but the eyes are concealed. Is this correct or is it haraam to wear clothes with any picture irrespective of whether the eyes are visible or not?\n\n3) Is it permissible for us to buy teddy bears, dolls and other stuffed toys for our children? I have heard that Bibi Aisha RA, the wife of Rasulullah SAW had dolls and thus this is evidence of permissibility for us to allow our children to play with stuffed animals and dolls. Is this correct? Please advise.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. It is not permissible to purchase or portray pictures of any animate object, be it images on clothes, on books, newspapers, advertisements, etc. However, where there is a need, for example, pictures of animate objects need to be viewed for educational purposes, then it will be permissible.\n\nThe concept that many people have that if the eyes are removed from the picture of animate object, it no longer remains Moorat, is in fact a misconception. The Fuqahaa (jurists) are unanimous that the entire head of the animate object has to be removed then only will it be permissible. merely removing the eyes is not sufficient. (Raddul Muhtaar vol.1 pg.648; HM Saeed; Fataawa Hindiyyah vol.1 pg.107; Rashidiyyah)\n\n2. There is no difference between images of a fantastical character and a real character. The underlying factor is that it is an image of an animate object which is not permissible.\n\n3. It is not permissible to purchase teddy bears and dolls, etc.\n\n\n4. It is permissible to sell items which have printed animate objects on them. It is also permissible to sell stuffed toys. However, it will not be permissible to sell stuffed animate objects if it used for decorational purposes as this will be resembling idolatry.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
