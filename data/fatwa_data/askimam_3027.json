  "question": "What religion did our Nabi's parents follow?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam. If they were part of the Quraysh, and the Quraysh were mushriks, did this include the parents of our nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) ? What do we know about them? JazakAllah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe era between Eesa (Alayhis salaam) and Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) is known as Fatrat-e-Nubuwwat (era without prophethood).\n\nWhile the majority of the people were idol worshippers, there were also the\nAhlul Kitaab (Christian and Jews). The accepted religion of that time by\nAllah was Christianity which abrogated Judaism. The Christians did not\nfollow the actual orders of Allah Ta'ala and due to the long duration\nbetween Eesa (Alayhis salaam) and Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam),\nthe religion of Allah of that was almost extinct.\n\nThe Ulama have discussed the faith of people (including the parents of\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) living in that era. One of the\nopinions is those who did not commit Shirk, but did not follow the accepted\nreligion of that time, for example, the parents of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu\nAlayhi Wasallam) will be excused and forgiven.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
