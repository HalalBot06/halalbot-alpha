  "question": "Can a couple spend time before the Walima",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know if nikkah was held in April 2007,The bride will only come & live with the groom 6-8 weeks later but they will be meeting & spending time together a week after nikkah.Can the walima be hel 6-8 weeks later\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is sunnah to have the walima after the husband and wife meet for the first time. Walima is sunnah and should be carried out the sunnah way. There is no need to have an elaborate meal. Whatever one can afford at that time may be presented to whoever is present. At times the walima of Rasulullah (SAW) was only wheat and dates. There is barakah in following the sunnah of Rasulullah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
