The Imaam recited to you%0D%0Athree verses from the Noble Qur%E3n:%0D%0A%0D%0ASurah Nissa (4) verse 1%0D%0AO Mankind Fear your guardian Lord who created you from a single soul, and He%0D%0Acreated from it its mate and from them He scattered many men and women.%0D%0ASurah Aale Imraan (3) verse 102%0D%0AO Ye who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared and die not except in a%0D%0Astate of Islam.%0D%0ASurah Ahzaab (33) verse 70%0D%0AO Ye who believe. Fear Allah and make your utterances straight.%0D%0ATAQWA%0D%0AThe common element in each of these verses is the Arabic word 'Taqwa' (God%0D%0AConsciousness). In these verses you are reminded to fear Allah Ta%E3la in the%0D%0Amanner you treat the lady you are taking as your wife. There is no one to%0D%0Asee the way you conduct yourself within your home. Let the fact and belief%0D%0Athat Allah is watching guide you in your treatment of the woman you have%0D%0Amade your wife by granting her the respect and dignity she deserves.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou have brought somebody's daughter into your own home. She left her%0D%0Afamily, her friends, close associates and in many cases even the town that%0D%0Ashe grew up in and she came to a strange environment just to share the rest%0D%0Aof her life with you. Was she handed over to you to be a target of your%0D%0Aphysical and verbal abuse?%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Prophet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) is reported to have said in%0D%0Aconnection with the treatment of animals: 'Fear Allah in your treatment of%0D%0Athese animals who cannot speak.' If this was his concern for the animals,%0D%0Ahow tremendously greater would his concern have been for humans; therefore,%0D%0Acan you imagine what his reaction would have been to the wife battering that%0D%0Atakes place nowadays?%0D%0A%0D%0AWhat then are the most important ingredients of a happy marriage? Allah%0D%0ATa%E3la says in Surah Roum (30) verse 21.%0D%0A'And from amongst His signs is that He created for you from amongst%0D%0Ayourselves partners, that you may live in tranquility with them, and He has%0D%0Acreated love and mercy between you. Verily in that are signs for those who%0D%0Areflect.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is this love and mercy that strengthens the bond of marriage. The ability%0D%0Ato overlook each other's faults goes a long way in cementing the%0D%0Arelationship. Once a man came to Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)%0D%0Aand said, 'O Allah's messenger, how many times should I forgive the wrongs%0D%0Aof my slaves.' The Prophet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) replied, 'Forgive%0D%0Athem seventy times a day.' If a worker is entitled to so much of compassion%0D%0Awhat about your lifelong companion?%0D%0A%0D%0ABEST OF YOU%0D%0AToday, we are very courteous to our clients, appreciative to our colleagues%0D%0Aand cheerful to our friends. Unfortunately this warmth is not extended to%0D%0Athe poor wife who is most deserving of this courtesy and charm. The Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, 'The most complete%0D%0Aof believers in faith are those who are best in character. The best of you%0D%0Aare those who are best to their wives.' (Mishkat)%0D%0A%0D%0AEvery person has shortcomings. It is therefore quite natural to find this in%0D%0Ayour partner. The Prophet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) has advised us to%0D%0Atake pleasure in the good and overlook the bad. Have you ever spared the%0D%0Athought that there may be so many habits which you possess that may be%0D%0Abringing grief to your wife? She may have been patiently bearing it not%0D%0Awanting to hurt your feelings.%0D%0ALet us go back and fulfil the demands of this contract.%0D%0A%0D%0ATREAT YOUR WIFE AS YOU WOULD LIKE YOUR SON-IN-LAW TO TREAT YOUR DAUGHTER.%0D%0A%0D%0ABy: Ml. I Khamissa%0D%0A%0D%0A------------------%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0ANIKAH: Wife's obligation%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A-----------------%0D%0A%0D%0AMany prospective wives seem to have their hopes dashed after they enter into%0D%0Athe contract of marriage. Once the honeymoon is over, suddenly things are%0D%0Anot so rosy any more, and the reality of married life seems to be a far cry%0D%0Afrom the Haraam movies which many have been watching or the novels which end%0D%0Aup with 'and they lived happily ever after'. In a world where it has become%0D%0Afashionable to engage in immoral activities and illicit relationships, it is%0D%0Abecoming increasingly difficult to convince people that marriage is an%0D%0Aimportant component of a pure society.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhat guidelines does the Shari%E1h give the wife to help cement the%0D%0Arelationship between herself and her husband?%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Qur%E3n in Surah Shu%E1raa (v74), describes the prayer of the pious in the%0D%0Afollowing manner: 'Oh our lord! Grant us wives and offspring who will be the%0D%0Ajoy and comfort of our eyes.' The explanation of the above verse is clearly%0D%0Aillustrated in the beautiful words of Nabi (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) (as%0D%0Anarrated by ibn Abbaas) 'The best woman (wife) is the one whom, when you%0D%0Alook at her she pleases you, when you command her she obeys you, when you%0D%0Aare not in her presence she safeguards herself and your belongings.'%0D%0A%0D%0AToday, the wife adorns herself for weddings and other social events,%0D%0Abeautifying herself to attract the attention of everyone else besides the%0D%0Aone who is most important in her life. The husband comes home tired from%0D%0Awork, only to find his wife shabbily dressed, too glued to the drama on TV%0D%0Ato even reply to the Salaam of her husband. Meal times and other household%0D%0Aduties are dictated by the box. The children are sent away to their rooms%0D%0Awith the words 'Go to your room and read your Qur%E3n - or finish up your%0D%0Ahomework.' These words, mind you, are not uttered because of some great%0D%0Aconcern for the child's education; in fact it is only mentioned to get them%0D%0Aout of the way.%0D%0A%0D%0ARemember! Your children may not do what you ask them to do, but they very%0D%0Aoften do what they see you do. What kind of example are we setting for these%0D%0Aimpressionable young minds?%0D%0AUnrealistic demands made by the wife do not help much to strengthen the%0D%0Amarital bond. Being dictated by fashion and the way the people next door are%0D%0Aliving, the wife forces the husband to beg and borrow just to keep up with%0D%0Athe Jones's. 'If your brother's wife can have it, then why can't I?' 'Well%0D%0Ayour sister has it in her house.' Comparing ourselves with those who have%0D%0Amore than us does not help to relieve tension between husband and wife. The%0D%0Awords of Nabi (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) beautifully explain:%0D%0A%0D%0A'Look at those who have less than you, do not look at those who have more%0D%0Athan you, (if you do so) then you are more likely to appreciate Allah's%0D%0Afavours upon you.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIf a man had to choose a wife according to the guidelines given by%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam), what kind of a person was he to%0D%0Alook for? The Hadith states: 'A woman is married for four (things); her%0D%0Awealth, her family status, her beauty and her religion. So choose (marry)%0D%0Athe religious woman, otherwise you will be a loser.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThe most important quality of the wife is consciousness of her Islamic%0D%0Aresponsibilities. How Deeni conscious are you? How supportive are you of%0D%0Ayour husband when he is engaged in Deeni activities? Are you preventing him%0D%0Afrom serving humanity?%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Qur%E3n in Surah Rum (v21) explains the purpose of marriage as a source of%0D%0Acomfort for both partners. No one has married 'Mr Perfect' and no one is%0D%0Aperfect! Are you making the environment in the home conducive to living in%0D%0Apeace and harmony or does your husband feel that he rather be at work than%0D%0Aat home with you?%0D%0A%0D%0AWhat degree of obedience does the Shari%E1h command the wife to have for her%0D%0Ahusband? A Hadith of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) explains, 'If%0D%0AI had to command anyone to prostrate to somebody, I would have commanded the%0D%0Awife to prostrate before her husband.' However, if your husband commands you%0D%0Ato do something against the Shari%E1h you do not have to obey him.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf the objectives of both husband and wife are to please Allah, the couple%0D%0Awill find more common ground on which to build the relationship.%0D%0A%0D%0AMl I Khamisa%0D%0A"
