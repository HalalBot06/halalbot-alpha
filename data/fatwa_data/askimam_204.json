  "question": "I want to become a Muslim but since I was raised as a Christian some of my friends say I will go to hell because if I do convert that means I am denying Jesus. Please help me.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour friends have misguided you. By not accepting Islam, you will be denying\nJesus and his correct position. As a Muslim, belief in Jesus (Eesa - may the\neverlasting peace be upon him) is an integral article of our faith. A person\ncannot be a Muslim without believing in Jesus as one the greatest and\nholiest prophets of God.\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
