  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan you please quote narrations admonishing for standing in a saff alone. Also please explain what a muqtadi should do if he finds that the saff in front of him is full. How should he pull a person back? How many steps can one take while being pulled back and still not void his salah?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWaabisah [radhiallaahu anhu] narrates that a person stood alone in a Saff. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] instructed that person to repeat his Salaat. (Tirmidhi pg.54; HM Saeed)\n\nIf a person does not find space in the row in front, he should stand behind the Saff in line with the Imaam and begin his Salaat. (Shaami pg.647) He should take along with him a person from the front Saff to join him if he does not fear any confrontation in doing so.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
