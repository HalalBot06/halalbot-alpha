  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer below our reply to a similar query.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AShari'ah had not mandated a particular format for Da'wah work. Religious%0D%0Aeducation, Tabligh, Jihaad, etc. are different ways of discharging this%0D%0Acollective responsibility and they are all important in their own right. The%0D%0Apopular format chosen for a given function is an administrastive matter. For%0D%0Aexample, today our religious institutes offer instruction for 10 months a%0D%0Ayear, six days a week, six hours a day. They also have exams at%0D%0Apredetermined intervals. This arrangement has been found useful through%0D%0Aexperience, but it was not used at the time of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) and one cannot find any evidence supporting it in the books of%0D%0AHadith.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, since this arrangement is not considered mandated by the Shari'ah,%0D%0Abut it is only an administrative matter, therefore, it cannot be considered%0D%0Aa Bid'at. The format adopted by the Tablighi Jamaat is also of this nature%0D%0Aand does not need evidence in its favour as long as it is not considered as%0D%0Amandated by the Shari'ah. However, for our understanding, it is sufficient%0D%0Ato note that all prophets (Alayhis salaam), including Nabi (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam), had gone out to invite the people to the greatness of%0D%0AAllah. This is an answer given to a similar question by Mufti Taqi Usmani.%0D%0A%0D%0ATo claim that Tablighi Jamaat accords no importance to Qur'aan is an%0D%0Aerroneous notion reinforced by non-conformance to Usool (principles) and%0D%0Alaxity by some of its members which cannot be used as a basis to come to a%0D%0Ageneral conclusion. In fact, a lot of emphasis is given to the Qur'aan as%0D%0Aregularly mentioned in the Hidaayat (guidance) talks delievered daily in the%0D%0Acentral Markaz Nizaamuddeen that every Haafidh should recite no lesser than%0D%0A1 Juz. Brothers are also encouraged to teach one another, those who know how%0D%0Ato recite, to teach those who don't. In Fadhaail-e-Aamaal itself, is a%0D%0Acomplete chapter dedicated to the virtues of reciting, learning and teaching%0D%0Athe Qur'aan.%0D%0A%0D%0AConcerning the Mehfils of Dhikr in the manner you describe, many Ulama,%0D%0Aregarding it to be nothing more than an exercise to gain concentration, have%0D%0Ataken it to be permissible. It should be noted, however, that many evil%0D%0Apractices accompanying these Mehfils (when held by Barelvis) do in fact%0D%0Aconstitute Bid'at, such as belief that Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is%0D%0Apresent in the gathering, etc.%0D%0A"
