  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ: What does the Shariáh say with regard to dying hair? Is it permissible to dye one?s hair?\n\nA: To apply pure black dye is not permissible. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, \"There will be people who will come later (in my Ummah) and apply black dye. They will not even smell the fragrance of paradise.\" (Abu Daawood). However, it is permissible for a Mujaahid (warrior) to apply black dye in order to give the impression of being young. (Jawahirul Fiqh vol2 pg421) It is also permissible for one to dye his/hair black to beautify himself/herself for one?s marriage partner if he/she is young, and the hair has turned grey due to some sickness, etc.\n\nTo dye the hair any other colour besides black e.g. Mehndi or Katm (type of grass) is permissible. This was the practice of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) and the Sahaaba (Radhiyallaahu Ánhum). (Jawahirul Fiqh vol2 pg421) (Al-Mahmood Vol.1)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim"
