He says, 'through your offspring which were seeking forgiveness for you'\" [Ibn Maajah & Muntakhab Pg 465-Pakistaani R.WCopy]\n\nThat applies evenly to both boys and girls, and indeed Islam has promoted the upbringing of girls, and Allah Ta’ala condemns those that are distressed at the birth of a girl. The Messenger (Sallallaahu ‘alayhi wassallam) came elevating the rank of this gift from Allah Ta’ala by saying:\n\n\"Whoever takes care of two girls until they reach adulthood - he and I will come together o­n the Day of Resurrection (like this) - and he interlaced his two fingers\" [Bukhari Shareef –Hadith 5995]\n\n“Whoever has three daughters or sisters, or two daughters of two sisters, and lives along with them in a good manner, and has patience with them, and fears Allah with regard to them will enter Paradise.” (Abu Dawud & Tirmidhi Shareef) and also mentioned that;\n\n“They will be a shield for him from the Fire.” (Tirmidhi Shareef-Hadith 1914 & 1916)\n\nAllah the Most Compassionate says:\n\n [لِلَّهِ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ يَهَبُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ إِنَـثاً وَيَهَبُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ الذُّكُورَ - أَوْ يُزَوِّجُهُمْ ذُكْرَاناً وَإِنَـثاً وَيَجْعَلُ مَن يَشَآءُ عَقِيماً إِنَّهُ عَلِيمٌ قَدِيرٌ ]\n\nTo Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills. He bestows female upon whom He wills, and bestows male upon whom He wills. Or He bestows both males and females, and He renders barren whom He wills. Verily, He is the All-Knower and is Able (to do all things).\n\nAllah Ta’ala knows in depth why ‘this and not that’, as we facing one of the biggest challenges as parents to get our children to listen. I'm sure every parent has had that situation where no matter what you try to say or do your child \"refuses to listen\". \n\nTackling your query the answer follows hereunder:-\n\nOne of the fundamental principles of Islamic Jurisprudence is that one should avoid imposing upon one's physical body actions that are usually considered to be unnatural and unconventional UNLESS there is a real dire necessity for doing so. For instance, the human body is accustomed to acquiring its food and drink orally through the gullet; but there are times when, due to certain ailments, food cannot be given to a patient orally. In such cases, the patient is then fed intravaneously. Oral feeding is the conventional method whereas the intravaneous one will be considered to be the unconventional one. But because man cannot usually survive without food and drink, Shari'ah (Islamic Law) will permit the intravaneous method due to the dire necessity of the situation.\n\n \n\nIn the case where there is no such necessity, Shari'ah would NOT recommend the usage of unconventional methods of infusing objects into the body. That brings us to your question regarding artificial insemination. As all the modern methods of artificial insemination (GIFT, IVF, IVI and ICSI) are NOT  conventional methods of inducing fertilization and, at the same time, these are NOT procedures upon which one’s life depends (hence the absence of a dire necessity); as such, opting for these procedures would be against the principles of Shari'ah.\n\n \n\nIf a husband, personally artificially extracted eggs from his wife's ovaries and then mixed them with his own sperm before injecting them into his wife's fallopian tubes, OR if the husband himself implanted embryos into her uterus (as in the IVI and ICSI methods) then, provided that the husband does not acquire the sperm through masturbation (which is prohibited), but rather by collecting it in a condom during intercourse or into a container using the coitus interruptus method or in some other way such as by way of extracting it with injection from the testicles; then although these methods would NOT be Haraam, they would still be discouraged and regarded as undesirable and abominable due to them being unnatural and unconventional methods of inducing fertilization.\n\n \n\nHowever, in the case where one has these procedures carried out by a doctor (which will be the likely scenario), there would be many aggravating factors that would render such procedures totally prohibited in Shar'iah:-\n\n \n\nFirst of all, one will probably be required to extract sperm by way of masturbation. As masturbation is a sin and prohibited in Shari'ah, one will NOT be permitted to remove the sperm in this manner.\n\n \n\nSecondly, even if one can provide one’s sperm without having to resort to masturbation, then too there is the stigma of the husband or wife or perhaps both being required to expose the \"satar\" (those parts of the body that one HAS to conceal from strangers) to the doctor. One is only allowed to expose one's \"satar\" to a doctor when there is a life or death situation or in cases of extreme necessity neither of which exists here, as the desire of having children or a male child as in your case is NOT an extreme necessity without which one cannot survive.\n\n \n\nHadhrat Mufti Mahmood Hasan Saheb (Rahmatullahi alayhi) has also strongly condemned these unnatural and artificial insemination procedures, as can be noted from his Fataawaa [Ref: Fataawaa Mahmoodiyya, Vol. 5, Pg. 151 & 162; also Vol.12, Pg. 345].\n\n \n\nOur advice is, keep making Du'aa to Allah Ta'ala for a solution and accept whatever Allah Ta'ala has decreed and destined for you. If acquiring male child has not been destined for you, no amount of treatment is going to make any difference. Of course, one must at least try to do something, but in doing something, one should opt for procedures that are not considered reprehensible and detestable in the eyes of Shari'ah.\n\n \n\nYou should not despair in Allah’s mercy, always be a wise believer struggles to harbour positive expectations of his future. I believe that if Allah has decreed something for you that he does not like, it is good for you - even if you cannot, due to limited knowledge and wisdom - decipher exactly how. Be it marital woes, injury, illness, infertility, or financial stress – we should accept the choices that Allah makes for us, remembering that He is merciful, and that His choices are best.\n\n“\n\n[وَعَسَى أَن تَكْرَهُواْ شَيْئًا وَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ]\n\n(. ..and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you) meaning. Allah continues saying:\n\n[وَعَسَى أَن تُحِبُّواْ شَيْئًا وَهُوَ شَرٌّ لَّكُمْ]\n\n(...and that you like a thing which is bad for you.)\n\nThis Ayah is general in meaning. Hence, one might covet something, yet in reality it is not good or beneficial for him. Then, Allah Ta’ala said:\n\n[وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ]\n\n(Allah knows, but you do not know) meaning, He has better knowledge than you of how things will turn out to be in the end, and of what benefits you in this earthly life and the Hereafter. Hence, obey Him and adhere to His commands, so that you may acquire the true guidance.”\n\n(from Abridged Tafsīr ibn Kathīr)\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl.
