  "question": "Fatwa # 13977 - Isn't black magic and/or dealing with jinns haraam in Islam? If it is indeed haraam then Isn't a person like an Aamil who is doing black magic",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI read in your Fatwa #  13977 regarding and Aamil. You said in it that  \"...However, there are certain Amals which are very complex and deals with Jinns and black magic. There are people who specialise in such issues. This is a special subject...\" Isn't black magic and/or dealing with jinns haraam in Islam? If it is indeed haraam then Isn't a person like an Aamil who is doing black magic or dealing with jinns doing something against Islam? Thus, Is an Aamil a Muslim or non-Muslim and also, how can he treat people if he is involved in haraam practices?\n\nIn a biography I read about Maulana Anwar Shah Kashmiri (Rahimahullah) on http://alashrafia.com/english/anwar.html, it said that \"...Among his notable teachers are Shaykh al-Hind Mawlana Mahmud al-Hasan, Mawlana Khalil Ahmad Saharanpuri, Mawlana Is'haq Amritsari, and Mawlana Ghulam Rasul Hazarwi. He mastered astrology from Mawlana Abdul Jamil Afghani...\" I think that there might be a mistake here because as far as I know astrology is haraam in Islam. How then can Maulana Anwar Shah Kashmiri (Rahimahullah) master astrology?\n\nFinally, Mufti Saab I just wanted to know if going to a graduation ceremony is permissible or not? I am nearing graduation InshaAllah and going to the graduation ceremony will involve wearing the regalia attire and it may or may not also involve taking of photographs. However, these pictures will be taken by assigned photographers and it will be done without my consent\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. If a person is affected with black magic or is possessed by a Jinn, he could seek the assistance of an Aamil to cure him. The Aamil will not be ‘doing black magic’ or leading a Jinn to a person. He will be curing the person from black magic and from being possessed by a Jinn.\n\n2. I will comment on the issue of astrology after going through the biography on the site.\n\n3. In principle, if there is any un-Islamic practice that will take place at the graduation ceremony, it is not permissible to attend.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
