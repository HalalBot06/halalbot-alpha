  "question": "Is it permissible to sell ties? i.e. neck ties and bow ties?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nWith regard to pants and shirt, this mode of dressing has not been adopted by the learned and god-fearing, hence, attiring oneself in this fashion is not desirable. Moreover, a person would be deprived of the reward he would attain by adopting the Sunnah mode of attire. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyyah, vol.17 pg.349; Mahmoodiyyah)\n\nThe necktie, however, is surrounded by a controversy concerning its origins. If it was really a part of Christian religious dress, as argued by some, then its use would be totally Haraam / prohibited, otherwise Makrooh (reprehensible).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
