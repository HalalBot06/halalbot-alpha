  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Here there?s too much dealing with interest. Am I forgiven if I hav no choice but to receive and pay interest in the country I live? I always choose bank accounts which offer the lowest. Is this ok? 2 Is it permissible to use sun block cream whilst in ehram? 3. Me and my wife are in different countries at the moment and im worried abt her. If I want to see a dream to see how she?s getting on is there any dua for this?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is not permissible to engage in any interest bearing deal. If you receive interest from the Bank, you should dispose that money to the poor and needy.\n\n2. It is permissible to use sun block cream only if it is fragrant free.\n\n3. There is no need for you to see a dream about your wife. You may express your concern with her through the phone.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
