  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualikum Wrbh, Is it permissible for a brother to a approach a sister if you see her doing something which is unislamic. For example, from personal experince of one my friend. A goup of sisters with Islamic attire(hijab) were smoking seesha(hukka) in a restaurant. I don''t know how familiar you are with seesha. Its a hukka like thing practiced in the arab world. Anyway, so this friend of mine upon seeing this approached the group and sisters and told them it was islamically wrong to do this kind of thing in a public place. The response from the sisters was that it wasnt his business and Islamically he is not suppose approach the in first place let alone be the problem. So my qustion is if the brother has done anything wrong approaching sisters according to Quran and Sunnah. Jazak''Allah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for writing to the institute about a noble action which you carried out when it mattered most.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs Muslims we have been commanded to invite to good and forbid from evil. When we see a fellow Muslim in a situation which could cause harm to him%2Fher, it is better to try to save them than to just walk away and be puffed up with pride that you are not committing that wrong. A simple corollary is that when we see a fellow Muslim in need of help, be is male or female, we will help because of our brotherhood%2Fsisterhood as Muslims. It is however to remember that when the person is approached, tact, tolerance and wisdom should be applied so that the wrongdoer is not offended or hurt. %0D%0A%0D%0AThe retort from the ladies that your friend should not have been talking to them does not hold water. They were in a public place, out of line in their behaviour thus calling attention to themselves. My hope is that the brother's intentions were pure and his advice was geared towards earning the pleasure of Allah Ta'ala only. I hope too that he forgave them for their response and that he made dua for his and their hidayah. %0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala guide all of us towards the seeratul mustaqueem and keep us off the path of those who have gone astray and of those who earn His anger. Ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A1SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
