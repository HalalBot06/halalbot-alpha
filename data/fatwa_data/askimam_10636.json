  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was doing istikharaa for marriage for particular person (i'm the guy). In my dream I was reciting the following verse of the qur'an: And when you see, there you will see a state of bliss and a great domain. (76:20). I woke up and the verse was in my mind. I hadn't previously memorised this verse. What does this dream mean in relation to the marriage? Should I go ahead with the marriage?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe verse in reference is from Surah Dahr (time).\n\nGenerally, if a person recites Surah Dahr in his dream, it is an indication of the person being generous and also expressing His bounties to Allah. If you feel confident about the girl, and you do not have reservations, then you should send in your proposal.\n\nIt is always advisable to discuss such issues with your seniors as well.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
