  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe Problem from which I am suffering from is my mother wants me to marry a girl whom I dont want to marry...she gives me reasons why this marriage is better for everyone but when I think of it I feel like it would be unbearable for me to live if I will get married to the girl with whom my mother wants me to marry.And the girls also knows this and she thinks the same as I do. The reason of my and that girls thinking is because we consider each other brother and sister and we have also been together as brother and sister. I know that in islam only true brother and sisters are mahram and other are not but I have tried alot and I cant change my thinking about that girl and she is my Khala's daughter. Please help me out in this matter keeping in view that I cant think of marrying that girl and that girls thinks the same as I do... What would be appropiate for us to do according to Islam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFirstly, since the girl is not a Mahram to you, you should observe strict Hijaab (Purdah) with her even though you may have grew up as brother and sister.\n\nPerhaps, this separation will allow you to reflect upon each other and allow you sometime to think over this proposition of your mother. Nonetheless, if you do not wish to marry her, you have all the right to refuse. You should very politely and diplomatically explain to your mother that you are not interested in this girl and that you are not inclined to her.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
