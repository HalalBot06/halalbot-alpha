  "question": "1) I work at a grocery store and they are english songs that are played in a low volume. Is my Salaat valid - no matter how I concentrate on my Salaat, the noise of the song goes into my ear",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nYour help is really helping the muslim Ummah,my questions are:1)I work at a grocery store in United States and as you might know they are english songs that are played in a low volume.I get my breaks at such a time when it is time for Asr namaz and Maghrib namaz,I want to ask you is my Namaz valid because no matter how much I concentrate on my namaz,sometimes the noise of the song goes into my ear.Is it permissible for me to offer namaz at my work place instead of making it Khaza.2)As you might also know that in United States we have attached bathrooms,so there is no other place left to offer Wadhu and we Muslims are suppose to recite the praise of Allah Ta'ala while doing Wadhu,so by doing Wadhu and reciting those words in the bathroom am I doing anything wrong or disrespecting Allah Ta'ala.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. You should endervour to seek an alternate venue in order to perform your\nSalaat. However, if you are unable to make any such arrangements, then you\nshould continue reciting your Salaat in your work place and not make it\nQadhaa.\n2. If a person forgets to read the Du'aa before entering the toilet, then\nthe Du'aa should be read in one's heart, not on the tongue. However, if the\ntoilet and bathroom are combined, then before entering the actual place of\ntoilet, one may read the Du'aa verbally, on condition one is not unclothed.\n(Fathul Bari vol.1 pg.197; Daarul Qur'aan). However, it will be best if the\nDu'aa is read before entering. There is no Du'aa for entering the bathroom\nbefore taking a bath. If one enters to relieve himself, then the following\nDu'aa is recited, 'Allaahumma inniy a'oodhu bika minal khubuth wal\nkhabaa-ith'.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
