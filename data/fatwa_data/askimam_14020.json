Those who take pictures will be sinful. Your duty is to stop it. If after telling them they still desist, then you are not responsible for their actions. However, you should also advise them and tell them what they are doing is wrong and they need to respect the laws of Allah and respect our feelings on the matter.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
