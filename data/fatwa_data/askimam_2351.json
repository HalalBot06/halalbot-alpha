  "question": "What is the order of Islam about the custody of children after Islamic divorce?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am British Muslim, currently in Pakistan. I got divorce from my ex-husband through The Islamic Shariah Council. One year after this, I have married to my first cousin. I have two daughters from the ex-husband. What is the order of Islam about the custody of children? Can I keep them up to the age of maturity (17). My current is very kind to them and my daughters are also very much attached to him.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs a general rule, when a divorce takes place the right of custody in the\ncase of minor children is awarded to the mother first if she does not\nremarry. This is effective in the case of a male upto the age of seven and\nin the case of a female upto the age of nine. If she remarries then her\nright of custody is thereafter passed on to her mother, children's maternal\ngrandmother.\n\nAfter the respective ages of seven and nine, the father has the right of\ncustody. However, both parents have visitation rights when the children are\nnot in his/her custody. Visitation rights should be mutually agreed. Apart\nfrom the general rule, the overwhelming advantage of the children also plays\nan integral part in determining the rights of custody.
