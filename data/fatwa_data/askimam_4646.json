  "question": "Dear Brother Assalmualikim. My problem is - somebody did black majic to me and I am suffering from it for one and a half years. horrible situation. Please read information of my situations below.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI tried to get help from islamic treatment as well as medical help too. I had horrible situation. Thanks to Allah (S.W.T.) that I am better than before. But still I couldn?t recover fully. I feel napak most of the time .( The things around me I feel napak because before I didn?t think of it. But now I understand that I used them before in such a way that some of these are unpure). But I can?t tell this to anyone. Because it will be sort of impossible to wash everything, some things are not even washable. It is again hard to find out which is pak and which is not) Now the problem is if I go to the toilet now it takes 45min. to 1 hour. .I use water all of my body. If I take shower it takes 1 hour to 1 and Â½ hour. I feel more often that 1 to 2 drops of urine are coming out if I bend a little( I am taking medicine for that but still I have that problem). I have another problem of wet dreams. Do I need to wash the bed sheet and comforter for that? For female it is hard to find out which is unpure fluid and which is normal discharge. I can?t bend to wash my feet because of the tendency of urine drops or chance of opening that part. I don?t feel dare to touch Qurun because I know my cloths or my body are not pure. Please Brother if you know any dua or anybody's email no.reagrding to solve the above problems please let me know, if possible send it to my e-mail address. Masalam. Your sister in Islam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is sad to hear of your plight. What do you mean by 'feeling Napaak most%0D%0Aof the time'?%0D%0A%0D%0AThere is no need to wash all over your body after going to the toilet. Why%0D%0Adoes it take you so long to take a shower? Quite often, Shaytaan instills%0D%0Adoubts into the hearts of people. As a result, people continue washing parts%0D%0Aof the body and they still don't feel satisfied about those parts being%0D%0Athoroughly cleansed. This is one of the reasons the Shari'ah has enforced%0D%0Athe rule of washing three times only.%0D%0A%0D%0AOnce you wash thrice, your Ghusl or Wudhu is complete. If you are still not%0D%0Asatisfied about the area being clean after washing thrice, be rest assured%0D%0Athat Shaytaan is trying to instill doubts into your mind. Just leave it at%0D%0Athat and ignore it. Once you continue ignoring these Shaytaani doubts, your%0D%0Acondition will improve after a few days. Don't succumb to the dictates of%0D%0AShaytaan.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs far as your urine problem is concerned, it seems you are a Ma'zoor%0D%0A(excused person). A different set of rules apply to the Paaki and Napaaki of%0D%0Aa Ma'zoor (refer attached).%0D%0A%0D%0AIf any part of the bedding is soiled after a wet dream, it should be washed.%0D%0AIf no part of it is soiled, don't bother.%0D%0A%0D%0AContinue with the recitation of the Qur'aan after making Wudhu. Again, these%0D%0Aare Shaytaani thoughts through which he is trying to make you abandon the%0D%0Arecitation of the Qur'aan.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Kadwa%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
