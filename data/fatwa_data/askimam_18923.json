Since the basis of the relationship is on Haraam, the relation will never prosper to be a source of peace and blessings. It is not surprising that the girl dumped you as woman who are exposed to these type of relationships normally jump from one to another depending on how of much their material greed is satisfied.\n\n \n\nWe are human and we are bound to err. It is unfortunate that you have became a victim of such a relationship. However, this should not deter you from entering into a relationship which is lawful. The benefits of a lawful relation are innumerable. It is natural for you to have feelings for the opposite gender and Islam encourages you to channel these feelings in a lawful manner. Shariah discourages one to abandon the practice of Nikah (marriage) as such practice is unnatural. Your intention to never marry is not in line with the spirit of Islam and Deen. You should therefore put the past to rest and search for a lawful partner with true Islamic ideals, morals and values. Having such a partner will become a source of your comfort and peace in this world and also a means of your situation in Akhirat.\n\n \n\nMay Allah grant you a compatible partner. May Allah grant you peace and solace, Ameen\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n\n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
