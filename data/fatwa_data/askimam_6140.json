  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis Hadith has been recorded by Imaam Tabrani in his Mu'jamul Kabeer. (See%0D%0AMajmauz Zawaaid vol.10 pg.186).%0D%0A%0D%0AImam Tabrani has also narrated this Du'aa through the narration of Sayyiduna%0D%0AAnas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Ataught this Du'aa to Sayyidunaa Mu'aadh (Radhiallaahu Anhu). This is in his%0D%0AMu'jamus sagheer. Imaam Haythami (RA) said regarding it, 'Its narrators are%0D%0Aall reliable.' (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0ATranslation: Say (O Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)): O Allah!%0D%0Apossessor of the kingdom, You give the kingdom to whom You will, and You%0D%0Atake the kingdom from whom You will, and You endue with honour whom You%0D%0Awill. In Your Hand is the good. Verily, You are Able to do all things. You%0D%0Amake the night to enter into the day, and You make the day to enter into the%0D%0Anight (i.e. increase and decrease in the hours of the night and the day%0D%0Aduring witner and summer), You bring the living out of the dead, and You%0D%0Abring the dead out of the living. And You give wealth and sustenance to whom%0D%0AYou will, without limit (measure or account). O You Most Merciful of this%0D%0Aworld and the Hereafter, You give from them whatever You wish and You derive%0D%0Awhomsoever You wish. Shower upon me such a mercy which will make me%0D%0Aindependent from the mercy of those besides You.'%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
