  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu Alaikuum This is regarding the reply to Question 7993 on this website. The reply to this question is as follows on this website: \"If both die with Imaan as husband and wife, they both will be together in Jannat. The husband will still have his maidens (Hoor) in Jannat.\" I want to ask if the husband and wife be together in Jannat and the husband will have his maidens then what will be the reason of husband and wife being together? What benefit will wife have to be with her husband if he already has maidens (Hoor)? What if the husband just wants to be with his wife and not want maidens, can he have some other reward in exchange?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe wife will be made the Queen of all his maidens (hoors) in Jannat. The maidens will be given to him from Allah Ta?ala without him even desiring for them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
