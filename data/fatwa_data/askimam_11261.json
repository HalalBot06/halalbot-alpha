  "question": "can u clarify the length of the beard?...evidence you gave in Answer 9687 regarding the verdicts on the Miqdar (length) of the beard",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe evidence you gave in Answer 9687 regarding the verdicts on the Miqdar (length) of the beard from the various Madhahib does not support the statement in Fathul Qadeer (and your view) that ?nobody has permitted the trimming of the beard upto less than a fist?s length? because the prohibition in most of the statements were not clear (except for the Hanafi) e.g. An-Nawawi (RA) said ?the correct view (according to the Shaafi?ee Madhab) is to leave it upto as long as it grows and it is MAKROOH to trim it whatsoever.? (Al-Majmoo vol.1 pg.290) ? This does not prove prohibition; rather a mere dislike. Phrases like ?the best is? and ?he should not? does not imply prohibition (Haraam). Please clarify from all Madhahib their complete and overall view in light of scholarly texts to support your view. I understand shaving is Haraam but I want to know fully regarding the Miqdar.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazaakumullah for your query.\n\nWe maintain that the quotations cited by us in that article do support our claim. None of the quotations explicitly mention that it is permissible to trim the beard upto less that a fist length. We did not quote those verdicts to prove and prohibit, all we intended was to illustrate that the general books of these schools of thought have not expressly given permission to trim the beard upto less than one fist. We are certain you would agree to this.\n\nBe that as it may, kindly find attached our revised standard answer regarding the length of the beard. We hope you would understand it and Insha Allah you have no doubt about the length of the beard.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH SCIENCES\n\nchecked & approved by: mUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
