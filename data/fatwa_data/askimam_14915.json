  "question": "Cleanliness of half of Faith - What does this mean?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) what is meant by the hadith \"cleanliness is half of faith\" ? Can you please explain what aspects of faith does it cover and what sorts of cleanliness, physical and spiritual, does it mean ?\n\n2) which twelve leaders does the following hadith from Bukhari refers to\nVolume 009, Book 089, Hadith Number 329.\nNarated By Jabir bin Samura : I heard the Prophet saying, \"There will be twelve Muslim rulers (who will rule all the Islamic world).\" He then said a sentence which I did not hear. My father said, \"All of them (those rulers) will be from Quraish.\"\n\n3) What are our duties towards the members of the Holy Prophet pbuh's family as we are told to observe them in the following hadith from Muslim\nBook 031, Hadith Number 5920.\n\"...I am leaving among you two weighty things: the one being the Book of Allah...The second are the members of my household I remind you (of your duties) to the members of my family...\"\n\n4) I was of the opinion that all children who pass away before reaching the age of puberty will go to heaven. However, the following hadith from Muslim gives a different impression. Please explain.\nBook 033, Hadith Number 6436.\n'Aisha, the mother of the believers, said that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) was called to lead the funeral prayer of a child of the Ansar. I said: Allah's Messenger, there is happiness for this child who is a bird from the birds of Paradise for it committed no sin nor has he reached the age when one can commit sin. He said: 'Aisha, per adventure, it may be otherwise, because God created for Paradise those who are fit for it while they were yet in their father's loins and created for Hell those who are to go to Hell. He created them for Hell while they were yet in their father's loins.\n\n5) what is meant by \"everyone is facilitated in that for which he has been created\" in the following hadith from Muslim\nBook 033, Hadith Number 6400.\n'Ali reported that one day Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) was sitting with a wood in his hand and he was scratching the ground. He raised his head and said: There is not one amongst you who has not been allotted his seat in Paradise or Hell. They said: Allah's Messenger, then, why should we perform good deeds, why not depend upon our destiny? Thereupon he said: No, do perform good deeds, for everyone is facilitated in that for which he has been created; then he recited this verse: \"Then, who gives to the needy and guards against evil and accepts the excellent (the truth of Islam and the path of righteousness it prescribes), We shall make easy for him the easy end...\" (xcii. 5-10).\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1) The sholars have interpreted many different meanings to this Hadith. However, the most appropriate meaning is that the word “Iman” in the Hadith refers to Salah as in the Quranic\nverse “وما كان الله ليضيع إيمانكم ”and Wudhu is a condition for Salah, so it is as if though it is half of Salah.\n\nRef: Tuhfatul Ahwazi Vol:7 Pg:66 (Darul Hadith, Cairo)\n\n \n\n2) There is a difference of opinion to the interpretation of this hadith too. Some scholars have even named the twelve leaders from Abu bakr (R.A) till Waleed bin Yazeed bin Abdul Malik. However, the most appropriate interpretation is that it refers to twelve leaders till the day of Qiyaamah, some may have already passed and the others are still to come. Moreover, it is not appropriate to specify any names when Nabi (Sallallahu alaihi Wasallam) himself has not specified them; and wherever the scholars have specified names, they are mere assumptions.\n\nRef: Fathul Bari Vol: 13 Pg: 264 (Daru Ahyait Turaath Alarabi, Beirut)\n\n \n\n3) Our duties towards the members of the family of Nabi SAW are that we should honour them and respect them.\n\nRef: Sahih Muslim bisharhil Imam Muhyuddeen Annawawi Vol: 15 Pg: 174/5 (Darul Ma’rifah, Beirut)\n\n \n\n4) The opinion of majority of the scholars on children passing away before the age of puberty is that they will all go to Jannah. As far as the Hadith mentioned is concerned, the scholars have given two possible answers to it:\n\n         a) The object of Nabi’s (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) statement was to prevent\n\n             Aisha (RA) from making rational decisions without any proof.\n\n         b) Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) said this before he came to know that all \n\n             children passing away before the age of puberty will enter Jannah.\n\nRef: Sahih Muslim bisharhil Imam Muhyuddeen Annawawi Vol: 16 Pg: 421/2 (Darul Ma’rifah, Beirut)\n\n \n\n5) The Statement “everyone is facilitated in that for which he has been created” means that the deeds leading to Jannah will be made easy for the one who has been allotted his seat in Jannah; and the deeds leadind to Hell will be made easy for the one who has been allotted his seat in hell.\n\nRef: Ma’ariful Quran.
