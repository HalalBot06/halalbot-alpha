  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease answer some of my questions: I have been waiting for a long time to post these as i always find your session closed. 1) I have a scar on my chest which is due to the result of an operation that I underwent. the scar appears bad and not that pleasing to see. Now that my parents are looking out for alliances should I say my prospective groom about it. The problem is that if i say they think it to be some serious disease and if i dont they might feel cheated.What should I do? 2) What ever proposals come in for me seem to get struck at one place. everybody wants dowry. They want a house, car etc. How can I convince anybody that it is not something permissible in Islam. 3)As I am working please tell me some shortest dua to get married fast. I feel like a burden on my parents. Please pray that I get a husband who is strong in his deen so that I also make my Imaan strong.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If you feel the prospective groom will be cheated by not informing him about the scar, then it is advisable to disclose that to the prospective groom.\n\n2. Sister, it is unfortunate that such un-Islamic customs have deep roots in many Muslim families. Only a concerted drive by Ulama and seniors of the area can change the ideology of people. It may not be advisable for you to address that as it concerns you directly.\n\n3. Recite 500 Duroods daily.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
