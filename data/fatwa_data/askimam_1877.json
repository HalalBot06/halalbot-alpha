  "question": "Is it true that anyone who believes in soothsayers, their prayer will not be accepted for 7 years?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi wa sallam) said: Whosoever goes to a soothsayer is not from amongst us.\nTo go to a soothsayer is a major sin. We have not come across a Hadith stating that such a person's prayer will not be accepted for seven years.\nHowever, in principle, if a sinful person sincerely repents, his sin will be forgiven.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
