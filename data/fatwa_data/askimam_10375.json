  "question": "I wanted to know that if you end up falling in love with someone who isin't the same religion as you, and you know it will lead to marriage, will the relationship, or the people involved, be haram?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe have no idea whether you are male or female and what is the religion of the ?someone? in reference.\n\nAt the outset, we wish to point out that every type of premarital relationship is strictly prohibited in Shari?ah. Such a relationship falls in the category of adultery and is a major sin. According to the Shari?ah, it is not permissible for a Muslim female to marry a non-Muslim male. The marriage will be invalid. A Muslim male may marry a Christian or Jewish female only if he is able to preserve and practise upon his Deen. If he is unable to preserve and practise on Islam due to marrying a Christian or Jewish female, then it is prohibited to marry her.\n\nIt is not permissible for a Muslim male to marry any other non-Muslim female besides a Christian and Jewish female.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
