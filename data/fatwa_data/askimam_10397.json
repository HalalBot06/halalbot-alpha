  "question": "Is this advisable for a Muslim single girl to go abroad to work for the repayment of debts?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Sahib: I owe money to my bankers for credit cards and personal loans. Of course these are interest bearing. My present earnings are not sufficient to meet the monthly installments along with my domestic expenses any more. Being a single eldest girl of my four members family I am planning to go abroad for earning enough to pay me debts. Is this advisable for a Muslim single girl to go abroad for the repayment of debts? May I defer my marriage unless I am debt free? Is it undesirable in Islam to be in debts (without interest)? Is it an authentic hadith? That Allah will forgive all sins of martyr?s (shaheed) but debt. Did last prophet Muhammad (PBUH) refused to pray Janazah for debtors? I?m sorry for too many questions. Please reply soon as I?m in extreme depression and desperation. Thank you very much for your patience.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou state that you are a Muslim single girl of a four member family. You did%0D%0Anot state who the members of the family are - and if there are adult males,%0D%0Aand why do you have to work.%0D%0A%0D%0ANevertheless, if there is a need for you as a female to support yourself and%0D%0Ayour dependants, you may seek employment on condition you strictly adhere to%0D%0Athe laws of Hijaab. You state you are in debts. We advise that you remain at%0D%0Ahome and make some local arrangements for your debts to be paid. We prefer%0D%0Athat to the extent of being given Zakaat if you are eligible to accept it%0D%0Aover going abroad.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn these times of Fitnah and corruption, we strongly discourage females%0D%0Astaying by themselves abroad. However, if no local arrangements can be made%0D%0Aand you have to adopt your own means to pay off the debts, then you may%0D%0Atravel abroad with a Mahram to earn an added income. While being there, you%0D%0Ashould guard yourself against the tricks of the Shaytaan by being modest,%0D%0Aand strictly adhere to the laws of Hijaab. Once your need is fulfilled, you%0D%0Ashould return home. The Hadith in reference and the practice of Rasulullah%0D%0A[sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] are both authentic.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
