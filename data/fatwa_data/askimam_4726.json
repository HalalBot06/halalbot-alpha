  "question": "Please provide the Hadith that restricts menstruating women from entering the mosques. Also comment on the attached Sahih Hadith where women were ORDERED to come out to the mosques on the Day of Eid.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n>From Sahih Bukhari Volume 2, Book 15, Number 88: Narrated Um 'Atiya (radiallaha anha): We used to be ordered to come out on the Day of 'Id and even bring out the virgin girls from their houses and menstruating women so that they might stand behind the men and say Takbir along with them and invoke Allah along with them and hope for the blessings of that day and for purification from sins.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Hadith requested by yourself is recorded by Imaam Abu Dawud (RA) in his\nSunan (pg.34) and is classified as Hasan by Haafiz ibn-ul-Qattaan and Haafiz\nal-Zayla'ee. (Nasbur Raaya vol.1 pg.194)\n\nOther scholars of Hadith such as al-Munziri (RA) have also attested to its\nauthenticity.\n\nThe Hadith of Sahih Bukhari referred to by you does not contradict the\nabovementioned narration in any way. The Salaat of Eidayn is performed in an\nopen field and not in a Musjid. There is no mention of the Musjid in this\nHadith. (Refer Fathul Baari vol.1 pg.505; Hadith No.: 324 and Umdatul Qaari\nvol.3 pg.305)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
