We suggest you advise the girl that a boyfriend girlfriend relationship is haram (Strictly prohibited) in Islam. She should discuss the issue with her parents and decide with their advice and consultation. Furthermore, both of you are living in different countries. What is the point of getting married now when a woman is abroad?\n\nNevertheless, Nikah by telephone is not valid.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
