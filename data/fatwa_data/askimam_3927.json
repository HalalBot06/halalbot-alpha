  "question": "Can you please provide me with details regarding the intention for tayamum?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti, I am aware that to make intention for tayamum is fardh however will a mental resolve suffice or is a verbal intention necessary? Also, I have been told that if a person makes an intention in Arabic without knowing its meaning then such an intention is invalid. Please can you clarify this for me aswell?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn order for the Niyyat to be valid, the person must know in his heart what\nhe is intending. Therefore, if one did or did not make a verbal intention\nbut is aware in his heart of his intended action, then that is sufficient.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
