  "question": "I kindly request you to clarify us on Hijaab.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nBismillah Hirahmaan Niraheem Dear Alim, One of our brothers said to me: \"In some muslim culture, if everyone is wearing a hijab, and suddenly there is a lady on the street without the hijab, she will draw people's attention, same will happen if in a society like america, where no one wears hijab, if someone wears a hijab, people will be forced to \"notice\" that fact, which in my opinion is drawing more attention to her than if she was wearing just jeans and some modest dress.\" I kindly request you to clarify me his opinion. Jassakkallahu Khairun Khateeran. Warm Regards, Wassalam. Your loving brother.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe difference between drawing the attention of people in a Muslim culture\nand western culture is, modesty and immodesty respectively.\n\nThe attraction towards a female without Hijaab will be towards her form,\nshape and colour which motivates and enhances a male's sexual desires. That\nis not the case in a female donning the Hijaab as her queer appearance will\nnot fulfil men's desires of seeing her form, shape and colour. At most, they\nwill be disgusted, thus, serving the actual purpose of Hijaab.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
