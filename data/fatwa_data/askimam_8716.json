  "answer": "QUESTION\nMeelaad\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is not permissible to celebrate Meelaad and be part of any Meelaad celebration. Refer below\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\nWeekly Hadith - Friday, April 30 2004\n\nHadith\n-------------------\nSayyiduna Abu Qataadah [radhiallaahu anhu] reports that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] was asked as to why he [sallallahu alayhi wasallam] would fast on Mondays. He [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] replied, 'That is the day in which I was born.' (Sahih Muslim].\n\nCommentary\n--------------------\nThere are various opinions regarding the exact date of Rabi-ul-Awwal on which Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] was born. Some scholars said on the 8th; some say on the 10th, etc. Hafiz ibn Rajab al-Hanbaliy [ra] has stated that, 'The famous view and that which is the view of the majority is that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] was born on Monday the 12th of Rabi-ul-Awwal.' (Lataaiful Ma'arif pg.132)\n\nThe Hadith quoted above draws our attention to a very important aspect of our pure religion of Islam, i.e. to observe a fast (or other acts of worship on significant days or dates like is done on the 10th of Muharram (the day of Aashura as well).\n\nOur celebration of such significant events should in no way resemble the manner of the Kuffaar. Muslims observe these acts of worship, i.e. fasting, etc. as a method of Shukr (thanks) to Almighty Allah. How unfortunate will it be if one while celebrating these great events contravene the boundaries of the Shari'ah and thus invokes the wrath of Allah upon himself !!!!\n\nMay Allah Ta'ala grant us all the ability to follow the practise of our beloved Rasul [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] in every aspect of our lives, including the method of sanctifying the day or date of his noble birth, Aameen.\n\nNB. Among other significant events that occured during this blessed month of Rabi-ul-Awwal is:\n\n1. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] was given Nubuwwat (prophethood) in this month.\n2. According to many Ulama, Me'raaj [ascension to the heavens] occured in Rabi-ul-Awwal rather than Rajab.\n3. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] arrived in Madina Munawwarah after Hijrah (migration) in Rabi-ul-Awwal.\n4. Rasulullah's [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] demise was in this blessed month as well. (refer to Lataaiful Ma'arif pgs.135-136)"
