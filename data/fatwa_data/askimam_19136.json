  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. What is the accurate time interval for cutting the hair under the arms and in the pubic region for a woman? 4o days or after every menstruation when fardh ghusl is obligatory? \n\n\n2. Is husband allowed for cutting his wife’s pubic region hair?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nعن أنس بن مالك قال قال أنس وقت لنا فى قص الشارب وتقليم الأظفار ونتف الإبط وحلق العانة أن لا نترك أكثر من أربعين ليلة (صحيح مسلم)\n\n \n\nAnas (Radhiyallahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) stipulated the time for trimming the mustache, clipping the nails, plucking the armpit hair, shaving the private parts, that it should not exceed forty days. (Sahih Muslim)\n\nIt is necessary to remove pubic hair and hair of the underarms within a period that does not exceed forty days. If one does not do so within forty days, it will constitute as a sin.\n\n(Bahishti Zewar, 2/82, Zam Zam Publishers)\n\nAs for your second question, it is permissible but undesirable to do so.\n\n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMuftī Asif Umar\nWashington, DC (USA)\n\nConcurred by:\n\nMuftī Abrar Mirza\nChicago, IL (USA)\n\nUnder the Supervision of Muftī Ebrahim Desai (South Africa)\n\n \n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER – AskImam.org questions\nAskImam.org answers issues pertaining to Sharī’ah.
