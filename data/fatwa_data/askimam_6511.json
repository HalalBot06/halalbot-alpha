  "answer": "QUESTION\nis it true that u can not greet a faasiq? almost whole of my kin have no beard, then how am i supposed to initiate conversations with them? b) what is the similar ruling about biddatis c) what is to be done if a ghair-mahram greets u? d) what about very old women\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If, by not greeting this person, you will be breaking family ties, then\nthe better thing to do will be to greet this person but if this person knows\nyou are not greeting him because he is doing something wrong, then it is not\nnecessary to greet him.\n2. The same ruling will apply to Bidatis.\n3. In today's times due to all the Fitnah, it will not be permissible to\ngreet a Ghayr Mahram.\n4. It will be permissible to greet an old woman, but if there is a fear of\nFitnah then it will not be permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
