  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaams With all the atrocities being commited against muslims around the world, I sense and sometime will for war to break out so that muslims can once again be united, am i right to think this? also, how many more signs are left before we know qiyamaat is upon us and is the day close? thank you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is not correct to hope for war. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) advised the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) to ask Allah for Aafiyah\n(goodness) but if they are faced with war, they should be firm and\nsteadfast.\n2. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) explained the minor and major\nsigns of Qiyaamat. All the major signs, music, dancing girls, abuse of trust\nand power, etc. are common. There are ten major signs of Qiyaamat. Some\nsigns, frequent earthquakes, etc. are already common. The other major signs,\nthe coming of Dajjaal, coming of Eesa (Alayhis salaam), etc. are still to\ntake place.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
