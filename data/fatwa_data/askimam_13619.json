  "question": "I wish to invest in Roshgold investments and want to know if it is permissible",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI wish to invest in Roshgold investments and want to know if it is permissible. I think it is in the property market. Also can I invest in Roshsun. If it is not permissible, do you have  any other alternative halaal investment avenue. I need a reply ASAP.\n\nJazakalla for your time. May Allah reward you’ll abundantly and grant you in steadfastness in Deen.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe have not studied or investigated Roshgold and Roshsun, hence we cannot comment.\n\nAs a general rule, the first factor one should look out for when searching for a Halaal investment would be to ask: Do they have reliable Ulama on board to check and supervise their products. If no, it would best to refrain.\n\nAt present we have not approved any investment scheme.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala knows best.\n\nWas Salaam\n\nMufti E. Vawda\nfor Daarul Iftaa"
