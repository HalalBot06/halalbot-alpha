  "question": "can you point out in which text the Jews call Uzair a son of Allah ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThanks you for your response in Fatwa 13362 . You state that the passage refers to previous nations who bring Imaan. However, if you read the passage, i don't see how you derive such an interpretation : there's no mention of 'previous nations' in the passage, and it refers to Christians and Sabians in the present tense  -\n\nThose who believe [in the Koran] and those who follow the Jewish [Scriptures] and the Christians and the Sabians\n\nSo it seems that these group of people are being addressed together. Otherwise, it would have read something like :\n\nThose who believe [in the Koran] and those [earlier people]] who follow[ed] the Jewish [Scriptures] and the Christians and the Sabians\n\nHowever, be that as it may, can you point out in which text the Jews call Uzair a son of Allah ? - please provide the exact quote \\ reference ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Our interpretation is based on the principles of interpreting the Quran. The basic and fundamental principle of interpreting the Quran is one verse explains the other. Based on this, it is not correct to ignore the other verses pertaining to the same issue when interpreting a verse. The verse in reference should be understood with the following verses: \"Verily the religion that is accepted in the sight of Allah is Islam\". Then another verse states \"And whosoever seeks a religion besides Islam it is not accepted of him.\" It is thus clear that the Christians, Jews, and Sabians referred to are the people of the past when that was the Islam of the time.\n\n2. The Jews refer to Uzayr as the son of God in the literal sense. That is based on the principle of the Quran that the literal meaning be taken.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
