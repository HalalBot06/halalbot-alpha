  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. if a muslim owns a property is he allowed to rent it to someone who sells pork and beer?\n\n2. at present, there is a lot of hunger and muslims go for distribution of zakaat food, etc. and face non-muslims who are in dire need of food, etc. can one give them zakaat?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. It is not permissible to rent out one’s property to a person who sells pork and beer. Allah states, ‘And do not assist in sin.’\n\n2. Zakaat is only for Muslims. Lillah and other funds should be used to feed non-Muslims. We should not distinguish between Muslims and non-Muslims in providing food. All are humans and all feel the pain of hunger.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
