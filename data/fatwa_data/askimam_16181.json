  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know if a nikkah can be performed in the hall (infront of all the guests - except the bride) and can it be recorded onto Video.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nRasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said, “Announce the Nikah and conduct it in the masjid”. (Tirmizi)\n\nNikah is an act of Ibadat and a great sunnah of Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم). The occasion invokes the Rahmah and mercy of Allah. It is important to maintain the spiritual aspect of the Nikah and do it the sunnah way. The hall is void of all the barakah and blessings of a masjid. The atmosphere in a hall is one of partying and entertainment. It is not appropriate to execute such a great Ibadat and sunnah of Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) with such a low level of spirituality. The couple become halal with each other through the laws of Nikah of Shariah. It is highly disrespectful to show complete disregard and disdain for Shariah and to do it in a partying environment, where there will be general intermingling of sexes, photography, videoing etc. which are haram. Such an auspicious occasion must be respected and conducted as Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) advised, conduct the nikah in the musjid.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
