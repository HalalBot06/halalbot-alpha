  "question": "Reciting the HOLY QURAN in traveling vehicle. 2. Reading Quran through computer, does it needs that a person should be \"baa-wazoo\"?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. My office is about an hour drive from my home, and I travel through VAN with 18 other members. During the Holy month of Ramzan I use to recite the HOLY QURAN in the VAN, please tell if if it is allowed to read Quran in VAN, when I am sitting behind other people and the HOLY QURAN is on their back (although the seat's back are fairly high and I keep the Quran low, so that seat's wall is between people's back). Also when crossing HIGH traffic like trucks, the truck driver is sitting above my head. It's the free 2 hours that I can easily recite the Holy Quran. 2. Reading Quran through computer, does it needs that a person should be \"baa-wazoo\"?? as we can't touch the words. 3. Can a person touch The Holy Quran on CD's and cassettes, when he is not \"baa-wazoo\" or is naapaak??\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is permissible to recite the noble Qur?aan while travelling. However, the Adaab (etiquette) of recitation should be maintained. We suggest you try obtain a seat at the front of the vehicle so that there may be no passenger in front of you.\n\n2. It is not necessary to be Ba-wudhu (with Wudhu) when reciting from a computer.\n\n3. It is permissible to hold cassettes in which the Qur?aan is recorded without Wudhu.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
