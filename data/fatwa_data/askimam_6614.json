  "question": "I feel the importance of tableegh work. Women want to go in Jamath 3 or more days. Her children are all from 1 year to eight years age.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe people say leave the children at some friend or relative and go in Jamath. They justify if she had to go to hospital she do the same thing. Is it correct to do so base on this justification, from shariath view.(inviting to islam)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShe should not burden others with the responsibility of looking after her children. They are her responsibility, and take priority over making Tabligh to others.\n\nOne cannot compare with the case of hospitalization, for there one has no other option. In the case of Tabligh, there are other options available. She can attend a brief programme, may be once a week. In that way, she is not neglecting her children and also taking part in Tabligh.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
