  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have joined a road side assistance program - the terms and conditions are as follows.\n\nOur  Plan offers the following Emergency Roadside Assistance coverage and exclusive member benefits:\n\n3 service calls per year for anyone driving the enrolled vehicle\nTowing wherever you choose up to 10 km\nUnlimited tows to Canadian Tire Service Centres (does not count against your call limit)\nFree gas delivery (fuel C.O.D.)\n Battery boosts\nFlat tire service\nLock out service\nEmergency winching/extrication service\n\nWill this be considered as insurance?\nIs it ok to enroll in such a program or should I cancel it?\n\nJazakallah\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe roadside assistance programme as explained by you is actually contracting in a future uncertain event. One does not know if he will be stranded and will require the services of the company or not. This is exactly what insurance is.\n\nAs an alternative, if the company agrees to provide some definite and regular service, then this could fall in the category of Ijaarah (hiring) and the monthly premiums will be the Ujrah (fees). The roadside assistance could then offer all the indefinite services under this definite and regular service fees.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
