  "question": "A while ago I had a very disturbing dream.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy question is that a while ago I had a very disturbing dream. I had a dream of a grave stone with prophet (pbuh) and on it it said the words 'Soothsayer' (Allah forbid!). Can you please explain this dream for me as I'm very upset about it. Obviously it's not true, it could be a subconcious dream or something, especially as only the night before I was reading an article about how the kufaar deliberately write bad (and untrue) things about our beloved Rasul (pbuh). Maybe it's because this very topic was still imprinted in my mind? I would be very grateful if you could help me! Allah Hafiz.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream is true. It indicates that the Kuffaars are liars like\nsoothsayers.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
