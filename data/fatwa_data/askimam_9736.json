  "question": "Wet cloth over painting with Allah's Name...Must we have any particular care towards the objects cleaned with that cloth stained with that colour?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nmy wife has passed a wet cloth to clean a painting carrying the name of God and then used the same cloth to clean lots of other objects in our house. Then I realized that on the cloth there was some colour from God's name and/or from other decorations of the painting. Must we have any particular care towards the objects cleaned with that cloth stained with that colour? I have read that the water that has been used to erase Quranic verses from wooden tablets must not be thrown on the soil, but I do not know whether some particular rule applies to my case... Hoping that you can help me I thank you with all my heart.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nUndoubtedly, all objects which contain ?Allah?s name? are sacred and commands the highest form of respect. However, in your case there is no need to worry. Our religion is moderate and easy. It does not compel one to do something beyond his ability. Therefore, you may continue using that wet cloth on all other objects normally. There is no need to show special respect to the other objects.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
