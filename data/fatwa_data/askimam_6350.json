  "answer": "QUESTION\nA friend of mine who is studying Islam asked me this question. If there is a God then how come there is so much bloodshed, war, poverty, murder, rape, child abuse and many other social injustices in the world and why doesn't God do anything about it? It would be appreciated if you could please give a detailed answer.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe reason for this is very apprent and is found in the Qur'aan. Allah Ta'%0D%0Aala says in the Qur'aan 'Corruption has spread on earth because of the%0D%0Aactions of man, due to the wrongdoings of the wrong doers or the disbelief%0D%0Aof the disbelievers.' If a student is punished for violating a law of the%0D%0Ainstitute, what will be our reaction? We will say simply say 'The student is%0D%0Adeserving of the punishment'. So when man violates the divine law of the%0D%0Ainstitute of Allah, then why do we question, 'Is there a God'. Yes, there is%0D%0AGod and He is the One that has brought this condition unto man because of%0D%0Ahis misdeeds.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe second reason is, when this affliction comes unto those who are god%0D%0Afearing, then this will be a means of reward for them if they are patient at%0D%0Asuch a time. 'Does man think that he will be left alone if he merely says, I%0D%0Aam a believer and he will not be tested.' Most definitely, Allah will test%0D%0Ahim. Allah Ta'ala says, 'Allah will most definitely test you with fear,%0D%0Ahunger, loss of wealth, loss of lives and loss of crop. Glad tidings to%0D%0Athose that are patient.' This is a disguised blessing of Allah. When the%0D%0Asurgeon puts that blade on the body of the patient, even then it would%0D%0Aoutwardly look like mutilation or oppression, but it is the good of the%0D%0Apatient that the surgeon has in his mind.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
