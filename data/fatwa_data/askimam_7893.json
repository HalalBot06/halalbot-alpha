  "answer": "QUESTION\nCould you give me some information from the hadith and the quran that tells you that you should do good,read quran and namaaz follow the prophet,fast,study your denn and act upon what you learn.i want something that tells you what a muslim is not just saying the shahada and think that will get you to paradise you have to do good deeds and have firm belief in allah. being a muslim is something from the heart and the mind which you do with conviction and understanding\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There are numerous Aayaats in the holy Qur?aan that emphasise good actions.\n\n2. Besides being proven from the Qur?aan, logic also accepts the fact that the Shahaadah is like a key and good actions are the teeth of the key. A key without teeth is useless, similarly, Shahaadah without good actions is similarly useless.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
