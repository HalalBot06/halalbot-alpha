What i mean, is that, is the saying \"Difference of opinion in my (Prophet's) Community is a mercy for people\" a correct saying, and is true? What is the meaning of this hadith?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nImaam Suyuti (RA) has mentioned the following Hadith in his ?al-Jaami-us-saghir?: Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?The Ikhtilaaf (disagreement) of my Ummat is a mercy.?%0D%0A%0D%0AImam Suyuti (RA) then mentions: This Hadith has been quoted by Imaam Nasir al-Maqdisi and Imaam Bayhaqi without any mention of its chain of narrators.
