  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI asked u about what i should do knowing everything in my house is obtained through haram means. And u advised me that i should ask my father to stop. As a Muslim that was the very first thing i did after discovering,i tried to stop my father,giving him proofs and evidences from the Quran and sunnah,then telling him about the hell fire etc. But all my efforts went in vain,he is solid as a rock and does not listen(if Allah Wills He can Soften his heart,inshAllah).\n\nIn this attempt he has Scolded me and insulted me enough. It is out of my capacity to go on like this. That is why i asked you what i should do on my part,to save my self from this evil. How can i be pure when the food,shelter,clothing is all haram??? If i refrain from one thing how do i avoid food??? Please advise me something which i am able to carry out and which will kill the gulit and worry inside me.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are two aspects, a) Consuming Haraam and, b) Respect of parents.\n\nIt is absolutely important that you show full respect to your father. Allah has commanded us in the Qur’aan to be respectful to our parents. By him being involved in Haraam, there is no reason for you to compromise on your akhlaaq and character.\n\nThe issue of Haraam could be resolved if you use wisdom and diplomacy in trying to persuade your father. If you cannot achieve this, use the influence of that person whom your father has high regard or respect for. By being hard and rude, it will increase his stubbornness and create more disaster. If your father’s income is not purely Haraam – some Halaal and some Haraam – consider whatever you are using from the Halaal income.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
