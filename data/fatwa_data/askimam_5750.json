  "question": "What is the definition of promise in Islam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is the definition of promise in Islam? Consider two examples. 1.My wife asked me when I am going to finish my Ph.D.I told her Insya Allah by end of 2001.When I have not finished by then,she says I have broken my promise.I told her that she cannot consider it as a promise as it is only my target/estimation.But she insists that I have broken a promise.Is she right? 2.I have told my son he can play the computer with certain conditions.However later on, I feel I need to change/put another condition.My son argued that I cannot do that as I will be breaking my previous promise .Unless he agrees to the change.Is he right? Jazakallahu khairan kathira.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. No, she is not right. When you told her Insha Allah, this further\nindicates that it was not a promise but rather a target.\n2. This is also not a promise. You have the right to add on conditions as\nthis falls under disciplinary rules.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
