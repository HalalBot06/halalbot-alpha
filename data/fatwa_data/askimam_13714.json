I am Hanafi Muslima,Can I read only 8 rikath of Tarawi namaz in Ramazan time I don’t want to read all 20 Rikath of Tarawi namaz\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. If you are a Musaafir (traveler) and you confine yourself to performing only Fardh Salaat, that is correct and valid. You do not have to read the Sunnah Salaats before and after Fardh Salaats. However, the two Rakaats of Fajr Sunnats are greatly emphasized. They should be performed even if you are a Musaafir. If you are a Muqeem (non-traveller), then you have to read the Sunnat-e-Muakkadah Salaats. You cannot leave out the Sunnat-e-Muakkadah Salaats before and after the Dhuhr Salaat. If you are tired, you may shorten your Salaats. If you are tired, you may shorten your Salaats or take a rest and perform your Salaats later.\n\n2. It is necessary to perform 20 Rakaats Taraweeh for males and females.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
