  "answer": "QUESTION\nA)I'm male and follow hanafi school of thought,Please read the below hadith which is from Bukhari Vol.2:No.59 Narrated by Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiallaho anho):Allah's Messenger (sallallaahu 'alaihi wasallam) used to pray two Rakat before the Zuhr prayer and two Rakat after it. He(pbuth) also used to pray two Rakat after the Maghrib prayer in his house, and two Rakat after the 'Isha' prayer. He(pbuth) never prayed after Jumua prayer till he departed (from the Mosque), and then he (sallallaahu 'alaihi wasallam) would pray two Rakat at home.Now Please let me know 1) Whether we need to pray 4 or 2 sunnah before Zuhur,coz as per the above hadith Rasool sallallaahu 'alaihi wasallam used to pray two Rakat before the Zuhr prayer and two Rakat after it. 2) Whether we need to pray 4 sunnah ,2 sunnah and 2 nafil after Jumma or only 2 sunnah after Jumma Coz as per the above hadith Rasool sallallaahu 'alaihi sallam never prayed after Jumua prayer till he departed (from the Mosque),and then he (sallallaahu 'alaihi wasallam) would pray two Rakat at home.Is there any other hadith which confirms Rasool sallallaahu 'alaihi wasallam praying 4 sunnah prayer before Zuhur prayer and praying 4 sunnah ,2 sunnah and 2 nafil after Jumma prayer.Please adivise me on thisB)Also let me know whether its is preferable to offer Sunnah and nafil namaz at home rather than masjid, does that fetch more reward than offering them( Sunnah and nafil) at\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour question of whether one should perform 2 or 4 Rakaats before Dhuhr, it should be borne in mind that whilst the narration referred by yourself states that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to perform 2 Rakaats only, there are numerous other Ahaadith in which Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have performed 4 Rakats. In fact, this was the more habitual practice of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) ? as will be proven later.%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Sayyidatuna Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to perform 4 Rakaats in my house before the Fardh of Dhuhr. Thereafter, he (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) would proceed to the Musjid and lead the people in Salaat. (Sahih Abu Dawud Hadith1245)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Sayyiduna Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu) states that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to perform 4 Rakaats prior to the Fardh of Dhuhr. (Sunan Tirmidhi Hadith424 ? Imaam Tirmidhi has classified this Hadith as Hasan - sound)%0D%0A%0D%0AMuhaddith Zafar Ahmad Uthmaani (RA) while reconciling between the apparent contradiction of these Ahaadith with the one you have referred to states: that possibly Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to perform 2 Rakats at times and most of the times 4 Rakaats. (Ielaa-us-sunan vol.7 pg.3)%0D%0A%0D%0AHafiz ibn Hajar (RA) has quoted Imaam Abu Ja?afar al-Tabari (RA) as saying that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) would, most of the time, perform 4 Rakaats before Dhuhr and sometimes 2 Rakaats only. (Fath al-Baari vol.3 pg.75)%0D%0A%0D%0AThis analysis is supported by the following narrations:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Sayyidatuna Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha) is reported to have said that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) never used to leave out the 4 Rakaats before the Fardh of Dhuhr and the 2 Rakaats before the Fardh of Fajr. (Bukhari Hadith1182)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Sayyidatuna Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha) is also reported to have said that when Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) would miss the 4 Rakats before Dhuhr, he would perform it after Dhuhr. (Sunan Tirmidhi Hadith426 ? Imaam Tirmidhi has classified this narration as sound).%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Sayyidatuna Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha) is again reported to have said that when Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) would miss the 4 Rakaats prior to the Fardh of Dhuhr, he would perform it after the 2 Rakaats that follow the Fardh of Dhuhr. (ibn Majah ? Allaamah Azeezi has classified this narration as sound. Also refer Ielaa-us-sunan vol.7 pg.137)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn fact, in the light of these last 3 narrations, it could be argued that the 4 Rakaats which Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) would perform at home was the actual Sunnah Salaat that preceeded the Fardh of Dhuhr and the 2 Rakaats that Sayyiduna Abdullah ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) has reported Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) to have performed was in fact the Tahiyyatul Masjid that is normally performed upon entry to the Musjid.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllaamah Shawkani (RA) has mentioned a deduction very similar to this one. (refer Naylul Awtaar vol.3 pg.18; also see Fath al-Baari vol.3 pg.75)%0D%0A%0D%0AFurthermore, the above 5 narrations that we have cited discuss the practice of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Besides these, there are other narrations in which Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has encouraged the Ummah to perform 4 Rakaats before the Fardh of Dhuhr Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Sayyidatuna Umm Habeeba (Radhiallaahu Anha) has reported Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) to have said, ?Whoever remains constant with the 4 Rakaats before Dhuhr and the 4 Rakaats after it, will be protected by Almighty Allah from the fire of hell.? (Sunan Tirmidhi Hadith427 ? Imaam Tirmidhi has classified this narration as Hasan ? sound)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is precisely for these reasons that the practise of the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhu) was also to perform 4 Rakaats before the Fardh of Dhuhr. Imaam Tirmidhi states that, ?Most of the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) had chosen to perform 4 Rakaats prior to the Fardh of Dhuhr Salaat.? (Sunan al-Tirmidhi Hadith424)%0D%0A%0D%0AAs for the number of Rakaats to be performed after Jumu?ah Salat:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Sayyiduna Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Whoever performs Jumu?ah Salaat, should perform after it four Rakaats.? (Sahih Muslim Hadith2043)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the light of the above narration and the one referred to by you, the Ulama have ruled that one should perform six Rakaats after Jumu?ah Salaat. In fact, the narrator of the Hadith in which 2 Rakaats have been mentioned (Sayyiduna Abdullah ibn Umar) is also reported to have performed six Rakaats after Jumu?ah Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Imaam Tirmidhi states, Sayyiduna Abdullah ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) is the one who has reported that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) would perform 2 Rakaats after Jumu?ah Salaat, but he himself would reportedly perform six. (Sunan al-Tirmidhi Hadith524)%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore, Imaam Tahawi has said, ?It is possible that Abdullah ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) did so because he knew this to have been the established saying and practice of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).? (Sharh Ma?anil Aathaar vol.1 pg.234)%0D%0A%0D%0APerforming 6 Rakaats after the Fardh of Jumu?ah has been recorded as the practice of Sayyiduna Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu). (refer al-Mu?jamul Kabeer vol.9 pg.359; Musannaf ibn Abi Shaybah vol.2 pg.41; Musannaf Abdul-Razzaaq vol.3 pg.247) and also the practice of Sayyiduna Abu Moosa al-Ash?ari (Radhiallaahu Anhu). (ibn Abi Shaybah vol.2 pg.41) and others.%0D%0A%0D%0ALastly, it is better for one who does not fear being distracted to perform his Sunnah and Nafl Salaats at home. But if he fears that by the time he reaches home, he may get distracted and neglect the Salat, it would be better for him to perform his Sunnah and Nafl Salat ? in this instance ? in the Musjid.
