  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Sahab, As-Salaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. What is the Sharia'h opinion on the second Jamaat in Masajid. Normally here in UAE after the fisrt Jamaat is over, people performs another Jamaat. Should we attend the second Jamaat or pray separately if unfortunately we miss the first Jamaat. Some people say it is better to join the second Jamaat to earn the rewards of Jamaat even if some Faasik (Trimmed beareded, praying with Tie, pants below his ankle, etc.) is an Imam. Whether we should pray behind a permanent Imam with short or trimmed beared. What is the Sharia'h opinion? Jazak Allah. Was Salaam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nMany Fuqahaa (jurists) have stated that it is not permissible to perform a\nsecond Jamaat in the Musjid as that defeats the purpose of the first Jamaat.\nHowever, some Fuqahaa have permitted a second Jamaat out of the Musjid\nproper.\n\nOne should make every with possible effort in performing Salaat with the\noriginal Jamaat, he may join the second Jamaat performed outside the Musjid\nproper behind the Imaam irrespective of his position. Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Perform Salaat behind every Faajir\n(sinful person).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
