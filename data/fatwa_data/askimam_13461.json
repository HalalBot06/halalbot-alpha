  "answer": "QUESTION\nif you are in love with this an she is in love with you isit permissible to ask allah for us getting married?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAt the outset, it is important to understand that it is prohibited to have a love affair. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has cursed such a relationship. If you wish to marry the girl, you may ask your parents to approach the girl's parents. You may make du'aa for them to accept the proposal.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
