  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is the value of divorce filed by the wife in an American court? The husband does not want to divorce and wants to reconcile. If an American court issues a divorce on wife?s request, can husband and wife get together again?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the husband instituted divorce through court and it was granted, it will\nbe regarded as only one Talaaq-e-Raj'ee (revocable divorce). The husband can\nrevoke the divorce within the Iddat period.\n\nIf he did not revoke it, the Talaaq will be changed to Talaaq-e-Baain\n(irrevocable divorce). In such a situation, a reperformance of Nikah will be\nnecessary. If the wife instituted the divorce through Court, it will not\nconstitute Talaaq.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
