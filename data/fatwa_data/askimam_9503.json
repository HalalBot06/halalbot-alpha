  "question": "My husband is verbally abusing me by swearing at me, insulting me and shouting at me whenever something is not done according to his will.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHe is sometimes extremely nasty to me and says very hurtful things. I have asked that we go for counselling, he refuses. He thinks it is normal for a husband to treat a wife like this. I have asked for a divorce, he acted as if nothing happened. I love my husband, I would love for us to work things out, but he says he will not chance his life to accommodate me. What should I do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for writing to the institute regarding your problems. Please\nforgive the delay in responding to your mail. I note that you are in South\nAfrica. According to you, your husband is not prepared to improve the\nsituation in your relationship. Do you think it will be possible for you to\nphone the institute or myself so that we can get more details from you? We\nawait your response.\n\nMay Allah Ta'ala guide and comfort you, ameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n1SOCIAL DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
