  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan you please tell me if the insurance schemes on the website below (particularly the travel insurance) are legitimately shariah compliant.\n \nhttp://www.musliminsurance.com/TravelInsurance.aspx\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n Assalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nWe have browsed the link you have forwarded and cannot comment on the status of the product with certainty.\n\nNevertheless, the name Muslim Insurance is deceptive as the conventional insurance structure, value and purport is in stark contrast with Shariah. We have seen many other Takafol and insurance products with the same purpose as this company and found their products to be completely un-Islamic.\n\nOne should be careful and vigilant when dealings with such products. The world has realized that the Islamic Finance sector is a lucrative window for earning their fortunes. In this regard there are many opportunists in the market who use the name of Islam to enrich themselves and hoodwink simpleminded Muslims who do not understand the technical issues of business and trade.\n\nWe therefore strongly advise that the Muslim public should not fall prey to these artificial “Islamic” branded products. It is therefore imperative for laymen to consult with reliable, Allah fearing scholars who are not paid by these companies and do not fear or favour anyone when declaring Haqq before investing or financing through such companies.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
