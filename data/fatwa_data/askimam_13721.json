  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am facing one wierd problem eversince my childhood, and this is bothering me a lot. I am living now in states. When ever i gaze at the sky in day time i see some arabic letters which are vague, but i know something is written in Arabic, I cannot make out what it reads. I dont know what i am experiencing. also sometimes if i try to go towards commiting some sin i feel some one behind me watching me strictly, which scares me and i turn away. I know this is good, but i dont understand whats wrong with me, I would be obliged if you could help me, altough i guess i sound naive to you\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. We are unable to comment on the Arabic letters you see in the sky.\n\n2. The feeling of someone watching you and because of that you stay away from sins is indeed very good. However, you should stay away from wrong because of Allah who is All-seeing and All-hearing.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
