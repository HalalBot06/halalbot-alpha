  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. If someone masturbates before the age of 15 or before having a wet dream, does that make them baligh?\n2. If someone masturbates while fasting, will his fast break? will kaffarah be necessary?\nPlease provide proof.\nI am aware of the prohibition of masturbating is Islam and have made sincere taubah. I am merely asking these questions for events that have already taken place, and am not exactly sure how to proceed.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIn principle, if someone experiences ejaculation then he will be rendered as baligh, even if it is by way of masturbation. In such a case, his age will not have any effect.\n\n (Fatawa Shami, Vol.6, Pg.153, Saeed)\n\nMasturbation will invalidate his fast and he will have to make qadha for it. However, no kaffara will be required.\n\n(Aap kay Masail, Vol.3, Pg.284, Maktabah Bayyinaat)\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl. Abdur Rahman Shareef,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nConcured by: Ml. Abduz Zaman, Student Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nUnder the guidance of:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai Saheb\nDārul Iftā"
