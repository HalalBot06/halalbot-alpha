  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy sister passed away in a terrible car accident. What happens to Muslims who die in such accidents? How do we cope with such a sudden loss? What duas should I recite for my sister? Is there something charitable, like feeding the poor, which I can do for my sister? Please provide some information regarding Barzakh?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe are very sad to hear of the sudden death of your sister. May Allah Ta?ala grant you Sabr and reward your sister abundantly. She is indeed fortunate as she is a Shaheed. Among those enumerated as Shuhadaa, Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] enumerated a Saahib-e-hadm (a person who dies in an impact). Accidents are also included in this category.%0D%0A%0D%0AYour sister has been chosen by Allah for His special mercy. Indeed, Allah is better for your sister than you are for her. Also, the reward of Allah is better for you than your sister?s life. Whilst we grieve her death, we should be happy that she has reached her final destination as she passed away with imaan. Death is a bridge that meets the lover to the beloved. As Muslims, we should now focus of our condition and our ending. %0D%0A%0D%0ABe conscious of death at all times and strive on Imaan and on the right path. If we die in this condition, we will meet our beloved Allah and other dear ones. Your sister is beloved to you. Send reward for her in the form of doing good deeds, reciting the Qur?aan, giving charity and sponsoring students of Deen. Insha Allah, your sister will get the reward and benefit tremendously.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
