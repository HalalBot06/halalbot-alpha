  "question": "What is the fatwa about selling ebooks on Internet?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Sir, Please consider my entire situation. I have a weight loss info website and I sell a weightloss ebook cum a complete plan which I have written using information from various ebooks and plans (All the info in my ebook is general info that falls in public domain and is not patented so there is no unique information that's 'owned' by someone Plus I have rewritten the content in my words so original writers' copyright is not violated either Plus I mention wherever needed that so and so books were used to write this plan). I tell people that they'll lose weight with it & it's very useful ebook. I get regular sales. Then there are some people who might already know most things in my ebook. Then for some it might not work or some who don't use it properly or honestly. For such people, I offer 100% money back guarantee and stick by it whenever anyone asks for it. (Only 15% ask for refund so most people like it) Is everything OK with this business or should I correct something to make my earning Halal? Pls reply soon. I'm very concerned about this issue..Thanks\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour business is Halaal\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
