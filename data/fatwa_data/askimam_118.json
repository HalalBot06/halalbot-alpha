  "question": "kindly inform me of the correct method of performing the Khutbah for the Jumah Salaat. Is it compulsory for Arabic only on the mimbar?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJumu%E1h Khutbah - unlike ordinary lectures - the Jumu%E1h Khutbah holds a%0D%0Aspecial position in Islam hence the necessity for it being delivered in the%0D%0AArabic language. Its importance is recorded in the books of Fiqh. One such%0D%0Aquotation reads, 'There is no doubt in the fact that the Khutbah in a%0D%0Alanguage other than Arabic is contrary to the Sunnah transmitted from Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) and the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu %C1nhum).%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore, to deliver the Khutbah in any language other than Arabic is%0D%0Astrictly forbidden. (Umdatur Ridaaya, footnote Sharah Wiqaayah vol. 1 p.%0D%0A200)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe question may arise that in many parts of the world (apart from Arab%0D%0Acountries), the congregation for Jumu%E1h do not understand Arabic. It should%0D%0Abe understood that the Khutbah is not a lecture - it is a Dhikr. Allah Ta%E3la%0D%0Asays in the Noble Qur%E3n, '.Hasten towards the Dhikr of Allah.' (Jumu%E1h 9)%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore, the validity of Jumu'ah does not depend upon that audience%0D%0Aunderstanding the Khutbah. Furthermore, the Khutbah is from the Sha%E3ir of%0D%0AIslam (salient features of Islam). Like Hajj, %C9id-ul-Adhaa and the Adhaan,%0D%0Athe Jumu%E1h Khutbah too is from the distiguished symbols of Islam, hence, the%0D%0Aadded emphasis on maintaining it in the manner it was carried out during the%0D%0Alifetime of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam). It is of utmost%0D%0Aimportance to maintain the Sha%E3ir of Islam in their original form so that%0D%0Aits beauty can become manifest throughout the world. Can you imagine the%0D%0AAdhaan called out in any other language? It would not be called Adhaan,%0D%0Aneither would it qualify for Adhaan.%0D%0A%0D%0ASimilarly, the Jumu%E1h Khutbah, if delivered in Arabic - the official%0D%0Alanguage of Islam - will make manifest the essence of Islam. Hereunder is a%0D%0Abrief view of the four Imaams regarding the topic under discussion:%0D%0A1. Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal - the Khutbah is incorrect in any other language%0D%0Abut Arabic, and only if no one present knows Arabic or no one can read it%0D%0Athen only will it be permissible in another language.%0D%0A2. Imaam Muhammad bin Idris Shaaf%E9e - it is a pre-requisite that the%0D%0Abeginnings of both Khutbahs be in Arabic. If a person who knows Arabic%0D%0Acannot be found then at least one Aayat of the Qur%E3n be recited and if this%0D%0Atoo is not possible then some Tasbeeh or Dhikr (in Arabic) be mentioned.%0D%0A3. Imaam Maaliki bin Anas bin Maaliki - it is a condition that the Khutbah%0D%0Abe delivered in Arabic despite the people being non-Arabs. If anyone in the%0D%0Aaudience cannot speak Arabic or read Arabic, then Jumu%E1h will fall off and%0D%0Athey would have to read Dhuhr Salaat instead of Jumu%E1h. (Fiqh %E1lal%0D%0AMadhaahibil Arba')%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0A"
