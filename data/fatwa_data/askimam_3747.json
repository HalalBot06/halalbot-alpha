I want to tell my parents to let me marry her but they will say there will be a problem in my children like defects. I love her because of how religious she is. Help me please and tell me what to tell my parents and can I marry her because of my love for her? I need to know soon please. Jazakallah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the girl in reference is already proposed to another person, it will be\nprohibited for you to interfere in any way. If she is not, then you should\ndiscuss the matter openly with your parents and express your love for her.\n\nWe advise that Istikhaara be also made before deciding further.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
