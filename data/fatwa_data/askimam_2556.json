  "question": "No barakah We do not buy any luxuries just pay for utilities what could we be doing wrong.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nEvery time my husband brings money home the money goes straight out. There is no barakah at all. We do not buy any luxuries just pay for utilities what could we be doing wrong. Its driving us crazy and we're always shouting at each other. I know there is something not right.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt appears from your explanation that the income is sufficient to fulfil the\nbasic requirements of your family. That is the Du'aa that Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) made for his family.\n\nBe grateful to Allah Ta'ala and content for whatever He has granted you.\nYour situatioon is not one devoid of Barakaat as your basic requirements are\nbeing fulfilled. In fact, fighting with one another deprives one of\nBarakaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
