  "question": "I have recently be a victim of sexual harassment. Alhumdulillah it was only an advance that was made. Do I report this to higher authority or leave it in Allah's hands for he is the best judge?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for writing to the institute regarding the sexual harassment you have experienced. You ask if you should report the matter.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt depends by who and where the 'act' was perpetrated. If it was at work, then there is definate legislation which protects your rights against this sort of harassment at work. All you have to do is make sure you are strong enough to approach higher authority. Do not allow yourself to be intimidated or spoken out of restitution. It may just be wise to first consult a lawyer to obtain some guidelines. I think the CCMA will help you to deal with this problem so consult them as to how you should go about dealing with the person concerned. (The important thing is you must have your 'facts' straight and be firm).%0D%0A%0D%0AIf the perpetrator was a family member or a family friend, then do not hesitate to deal with the matter immediately. This sort of action must not lead you to think that silence is best. For too long men have taken advantage of women and little children with either threats or with the idea that the victim will not do anything due to shame and fear. It may just lead him to think that next time he can go a little further. Approach your trusted family elders and tell them about the episode. Under no circumstances should you allow the man to get away without accounting for his actions. He should be brought into line and warned in no uncertain terms that his bad behaviour is known to the family and that he will have to 'behave' in future or else !!%0D%0A%0D%0AI would also like to suggest to you that you should take note of the Islamic injunctions as far as your own modesty and protection is concerned. Women are by and large vulnerable in the South African society. There are daily reports in the media about vicious crimes which are being committed against women and even against little girls. Allah Ta'ala had definate reasons for laying down strict guidelines in the Holy Quran for our protection. %0D%0A%0D%0AI do hope you will think of working in an environment where you do not come into close contact with non-mahram men. That you maintain a strict work ethic and remain aloof from male co-workers. Dress modestly and 'demand' respect from your co-workers. (This includes female co-workers also). You can achieve this by maintaining speech which is devoid of any suggestions or words which can lead to misinterpretation. Abstain from socialising with or intermingling with non-mahram men at social gatherings. It is your right to be respected, honoured and treasured as a woman. In trying to achieve and uphold that right, you have to play your part too.%0D%0A%0D%0AMy dua is that all Muslim women will encourage their families and friends to work towards upholding their honour by observing the beautiful examples set down for us by Nabi (sallaahu alayhi wassallam) and the honourable women of his time. Islam has granted us honour, respect and a high position in society. Insha'allah everyone of us will strive to achieve and maintain that esteemed position by emulating the illustrious women who came before us. Ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou may write again if you wish. May Allah Ta'ala guide and protect you from the evil of shaitaan, ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0ASister Fadila%0D%0ASOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
