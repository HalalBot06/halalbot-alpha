  "question": "My uncle (my mom’s brother ) said he will give it to me and he said that I can pay him back whenever. Is that ok if he pays for my hajj?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) I want to go to hajj this year Inshallah but I do not have enough money to go. My uncle (my mom’s brother ) said he will give it to me and he said that I can pay him back whenever. Is that ok if he pays for my hajj? I also told him what if I happen to die during hajj will he ask my family for the money back and he said he would not. So would it be ok if he paid for it?\n\n2) I heard that muslim women are not allowed to shave their legs. Is that true? I know you’re supposed to shave your under arms and its makruh to leave it long for 40 days. I want to know if its ok if I can shave my legs or any other part of my body, or my whole body. Is there any proof for it in a Hadith or the Quran?\n\n \n\n 3) I would like to know if singing (without music) is haraam. Can you show me evidence of either side? Jazakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. It is permissible for you to perform Hajj with your uncle’s money. However, it is important to clarify if the money is a loan or a gift. It cannot be suspended between the two, gift if you die in Hajj or otherwise a loan. The amount should either be a loan or a gift. If it a loan, your uncle may forfeit his claim on the loan.\n\n2. It is permissible for a woman to shave her legs.\n\n3. Singing without music is permissible on condition the song does not contain anything un-Islamic in it. For example, it must not be a song that is normally played with music, it must not have a tone of a music song. There must not be any immoral contents in the song. Poetry (She’r) and Nazms (songs) are meant to refreshen a person’s Imaan and enhance one’s love for Islam, Allah and His Rasul [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam].\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
