  "question": "if i am looking to get landing in a country can i get married in the legal court without nikah then get a divorce just for my papers?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nquestion?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the conditions and procedures of the legal court marriage are not according to the Shari?ah laws of performing a Nikah. The marriage will not be valid according to Shari?ah, hence, there is no need for divorce.\n\nWe also advise that conducting a legal marriage merely to qualify for any legal status is incorrect.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
