  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalaamu alaykum\n\nmy question has not yey been answered\n\nWhen I was alone with this man in his car, he has me to marry him and I agreed and then I asked him to marry me and he agreed.\n\nA week later he jokingly asked me again infront of two other men.\n\nAre we married islamically?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n\nAs Muslims we are very fortunate to be the followers of such a Deen which is complete and  comprehensive. In our daily lives we should be cautious of how we interact and socialise with people. Intermingling of sexes is not permissible in Islam, One should abstain from the opposite gender (Ghair Mahram) in order to save one’s self from Fitna and Haraam.\nSecondly the act of Nikah should not be taken as a joke, Nikah is a great Sunnah of our Beloved Prophet Sallalahu Allaihi Wassalam. If one takes it to be a joke one would be sinful.\n\nHence there are two issues to your question:\nIn the first instance the Nikah would not take place due to not having any witnesses.\nIn the second instance if you replied in the affirmative in the presence of the two witnesses, he would become your husband and he would have to live with you bearing in mind the Shari obligations of a husband, i.e. to maintain his wife, provide shelter and clothing.\n\nMahr-Mithl (It is that amount of Mahr which women similar to her in her family will receive) will be binding upon the husband.\n\n\n\nولا ينعقد نكاح المسلمين إلا بحضور شاهدين حرين عاقلين بالغين مسلمين رجلين أو رجل وامرأتين عدولا كانوا أو غير عدول أو محدودين في القذف\n(306  ص, 2هداية ج )\n\nويصح النكاح وإن لم يسم فيه مهر  … فلا يحتاج إلى ذكره لصحة النكاح\n ) هداية ج2 ,ص323(\n\nوان تزوجها على أن لا مهر لها فلها مهر مثلها إن دخل بها أو مات عنها\n\n) هداية ج2, ص324(\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
