  "question": "1) If the hanafi time of Asr starts at 6:15p.m., while the Shafi's adhaan take place at 5:10p.m., will the Zuhr Namaz be Qada for a Hanafi at 5:10p.m",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) If the hanafi time of Asr starts at 6:15p.m., while the Shafi's adhaan take place at 5:10p.m., will the Zuhr Namaz be Qada for a Hanafi at 5:10p.m if he/she hasn't prayed due to some reason by that time, or can they still pray till 6:15p.m? 2)Is zakat payable for these situations:(i)To get poor girls married and give them dowry as dowry is very essential in Pakistan. (ii)To get dowry for the girls whose husbands have sent them home threatening to divorce them if they donot get that dowry. (iii) to get a toilet made in children's jail cell where there is not a single toilet and they all use the floor of the jail as toilets. (iv)for the sponsorship of girls in a Quranic educational institue (those girls who are very poor, and even their gown,scarf is sponsored along with the necessary books etc).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If the commencing time for Asr is at 6:15pm according to the Hanafi\nMadhab, the Dhuhr Salaat of that day before 6:15pm will be Adaa (performed\ntimeously).\n2. a) Dowry as we understand is Mahr. That is offered by the husband-to-be\nto his wife-to-be in in exchange of marriage. In view of our understanding\nof dowry, we have difficulty in understanding your query.\nb) It is not permissible to use Zakaat monies to build a toilet. Zakaat must\nbe given to a poor and needy Muslim.\nc) If the student girls of that institute are eligible to accept Zakaat,\nthey may be given Zakaat in cash or in kind in the form of clothing and\nbooks.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
