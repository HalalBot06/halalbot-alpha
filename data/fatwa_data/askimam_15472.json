  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf a Hanafi is going to pray in a Mosque where the imaam is leading a 8 rakaat tarawih in sets of 2 rakat, is it good for the Hanafi to pray after each 2 rakaat set with the imaam togheter, 4 rakaat by himself when the others are resting in between the sets, in order to reach the 20 rakaat?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe hanafi will fulfill his obligation of twenty rakats. However, he will fall short of completing the entire Quran in the entire twenty rakats.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
