  "question": "I would like to know whether i should peroform Istikhaara, or is a dua after prayer valid to make a decision instead of Istikhaara?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalamo Alaikum, I am a Shia girl & I wish to marry a Sunni boy, but I was unsure of converting to Sunni Islam. I performed Istikhaara, but I didn?t get a clear indication as to what decision I should make. A few days ago I prayed (not Istikhaara) that our marriage would work according to Islam, because That night I had a dream, that I was having a meal with the boys family, although I have never met them in person. Can I take that as an indication or must I perform Istikhaara and receive guidance from that? Jazakallah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMarriage is a major step in one?s life. If marriage is not conducted in a correct manner, one could end up sitting with a life long grief and sorrow.\n\nWe suggest you express your feelings to your parents or some senior from your family. Based on their experience, they will advise you. If you are not sure about the Istikhaara, continue making Istikhaara till Allah opens up for you.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
