If there was no water available in the radius of 1.8km, then you would have to make tayamum , with which salah would be saheeh. This tayamum would break as soon as you found water.\n\n2. We are unaware of any medicine. You should consult a hakeem.\n\n3. It is permissible, however gazing at the private parts of one another is not advised.\n\n4. Not only is it permissible, but it would be preferred.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
