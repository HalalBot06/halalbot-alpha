  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have read in the hadith of Bukhari that once Nabi s.a.w. prescribed to drink urine camel as medicine. At the same hadith the told the eyes of those who are murtad to be hooked by a hot metal.. please explain this hadith\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n·        The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) advised the people from the tribe of Urainah to drink the milk and urine of the camels of Sadaqah as a medication and a cure to their sickness, since no other remedy was available for their cure.(Fath Al-Mulhim, vol 2, pg 299)\n\n·        The people from the tribe of Urainah made Muharaba (waged war) with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and caused mischief in the lands of Madina. The Quran mentions divine punishment for such people:\n\nإِنَّمَا جَزَاءُ الَّذِينَ يُحَارِبُونَ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَيَسْعَوْنَ فِي الْأَرْضِ فَسَادًا أَنْ يُقَتَّلُوا أَوْ يُصَلَّبُوا أَوْ تُقَطَّعَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَأَرْجُلُهُمْ مِنْ خِلَافٍ أَوْ يُنْفَوْا مِنَ الْأَرْضِ\n\n“The recompense of those who wage war against Allah and his Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off from opposite sides, or be exiled from the land” (Al-Maaida 33)\n\nThe Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) ordered that the hands and legs of the people from the tribe of Urainah be cut off and also their eyes gouged. He meted out this type of punishment for the following reasons:\n\n·        As an exact retribution and requital for what they had done to the shepherd that belonged to him.(Al-Minhaaj, vol 11, pg155, Al-Ma’rifa)\n\n·        So that in future mischief and war against the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would not repeat itself. This was a political strategy of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). (Takmila Fath Al-Mulhim, vol 2, pg 307, Karachi)\n\nThis incident exposes two perfect qualities of Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) i.e. his kindness and justice. He prescribed medication for the sickness of the people, attended to their needs, allowed them to benefit from the camels of sadaqah. This was a display of his kindness and his executing of a exact retribution was a display of his justice.(Takmila Fath Al-Mulhim, vol 2, pg 307, Karachi)\n\nهذا الحديث أصل في عقوبة المحاربين ، وهو موافق لقول الله تعالى : { إنما جزاء الذين يحاربون الله ورسوله ويسعون في الأرض فسادا أن يقتلوا أو يصلبوا أو تقطع أيديهم وأرجلهم من خلاف أو ينفوا من الأرض } (المنهاج 11\\  153المعرفة)\n\nوفيهم نزلت آية المحاربة وإنما فعل النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم بهم ما فعل قصاصا ؛ لأنهم فعلوا بالرعاة مثل ذلك(المنهاج)     ان شربهم للابوال كان علي سبيل التداوي للضرورة(فتح الملهم ) \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
