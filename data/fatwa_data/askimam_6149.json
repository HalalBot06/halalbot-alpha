  "question": "Is it allowed to make dua in my prayers for the name of the girl I want to marry.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDu'aa is the essence of Ibaadat. We are encouraged to make Du'aa for all our\nneeds. It is also encouraged to make Du'aa for others.\n\nDu'aa is also a means of ones spiritual upliftment. If you are already\nproposed to the girl and is certain to marry her and your making Du'aa for\nher is not just motivated by your passion for the girl, then you may make Du\n'aa for her. If you are not proposed to the girl and you are motivated by\nyour passion for the girl, then that is a shortcoming and detrimental to\nyour spirituality. In such a situation, you should not think or make Du'aa\nfor the girl.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
