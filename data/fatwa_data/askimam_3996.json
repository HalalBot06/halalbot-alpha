  "question": "Is it permissible for my wife to stay over at her aunts (fathers sisters) house ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nas-salaamu 'alaikum, I would like to know whether it is permissible for my wife to stay over at her aunts (fathers sisters) house, there are ghair-mahrams living in the same house. I believe that because she (her aunt) is female she doesn't qualify as a mahram. Is this correct ?. Does having other female relatives in the house make up for this ?. Jazak Allah Khairon.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for your wife to stay at your aunt's house if the\nfollowing are met: a) There is no fear of Fitnah, b) There is no Khalwah,\ni.e. man and woman who are not Mahram being alone, c) Proper Hijaab is\nfollowed at all times.\n\nAll said, it is preferred that she be accompanied by a Mahram.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
