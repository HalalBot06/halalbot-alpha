  "question": "Is it possible to contract hire a car on the bases of PCP (Personal Contract Purchase)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like to contract hire a motor vehicle over three years and to do so via PCP. The manner in which it operates is you select the car and monthly payments are agreed, with the option at the end of the three years to purchase the vehicle, trade in for new or give it back.My concern is that the initial purchasing is based on interest added to the vehicle but can I still contract hire and give the car back after three years?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe would appreciate if you give us more details on the contract. If you have\nany documentation on the contract, please forward it to us.\n\nIf you have the right to trade in, then it appears that you are an owner. On\nthe other hand, you can simply return the car without any return. This\napplies that the car is not yours. There seem to be some contradiction. We\nwould thus like to examine the exact nature of the contract.\n\nDoes one have to decide on these options before the hiring, or at the end of\nthree years? Please provide more details.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
