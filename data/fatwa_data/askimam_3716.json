  "question": "If one was previously married,is it compulsory for one to declare this to any prospective marriage partner or not?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am finding it hard to remarry simply because of the sheer prejudice in the Pakistani community against divorced men with children from a previous marriage so I want to know if it is required by shariah for a man to divulge information about his previous life to one who had no part nor will ever need to involved in its details insha'Allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA person's past plays an integral role in making a major decision like\nmarriage.\n\nIf the prospective marriage partner assumes you to be an unmarried person,\nthen it is essential for you to be honest, transparent and disclose your\npast to her as maintaining silence may create an impression of you being\nunmarried. That may be misleading to her and her decision. Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Whosoever deceives is not from among\nus.'\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
