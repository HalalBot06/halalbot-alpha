  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI lived in USA I know some people who brought their parents here on immigrant visa and now they have a green card. In order to keep green card valid you should stay in the country or if you leave you should come back to the country within a year or else the green card will expire according to the law. (some Muslim have a concept the USA is not a Muslim country so they don't have to follow some law according to the Quran and Sunni). When we leave USA they do not stamp the passport for exiting the country, they only way to know that you left the country the the next entering country will stamp your passport for entering the country. So what we do (specially) going back to Pakistan we bribe the immigration officer in Pakistan so he can not stamp the passport for entering the country. The reason we do this so we don't have to comeback within a year and we can also get the citizenship faster. I think it is a common sense that we are lying to the US government that we left the country on such and such date instead of original dates and we are also commit a sin for bribing the officer for not stamping a passport. I hope you understand my question. I would like to know according to Quran and Sunni that this act is acceptable. I will appreciate it for you response. JAK\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:"
