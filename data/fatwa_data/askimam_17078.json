  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\n \n\nIf we are still fasting, then how will the fast work.. Do we begin when it is the earliest Sehre that we pass through on the flight?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIn principle, it is not compulsory for a person to fast in Ramadan while traveling a distance of 78 Kms or more. If a traveler did not fast in Ramadan, he will have to make up for the missed fast later.\n\nIf one is traveling by air, and wishes to fast, he may rely on the time zone of the area he is flying on. The subah Sadiq (break of dawn) which is the commencing time for fasting and the sunset can be determined from the windows of the aircraft.\n\nOne may also make use of the flight magazine which has time zones of different countries at the back of the magazine.\n\nOne may also download the Subah Sadiq and sunset times from the internet.\n\nwww.saaoac.co.za\n\n \nWasalam\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
