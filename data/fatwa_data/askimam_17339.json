  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am inuk in uk for qurbani cow is around  £6oo and indiia cow is for£60 can i do qurbni anywhere in the world\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is mustahab (preferable) for the one doing qurbani to sacrifice the animal with his own hands. If one is unable to do so, he should try and be present at the place where the sacrifice is being done.\n\nIt is mentioned in Hadith that Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) said to Fatimah (RadiyAllahu Anha),\"Be present in the place where your qurbani is done, for your past sins will be forgiven with each drop of blood of qurbani.\"\n\nRasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) then clarified that this ruling is for all Muslims, not just the people of his household.\n\nIt is also mustahab for one to eat some from the qurbani meat and to have some of the meat as the first meal on the day of Eid if possible.\n\nOne may have an animal slaughtered elsewhere on his behalf as well if he is unable to make qurbani himself.\n\nTherefore, although the price of a cow is more expensive in the than it is in as you have stated in your query, one should make an all-out effort to try and make qurbani himself or at least be present at the place of sacrifice. In this way, one will benefit by gaining the full above mentioned reward InshaAllah.\n\nIf one is unable to do so, then it will be permissible to send money for an animal in and have it slaughtered on your behalf.\n\nقال رحمه الله : ( وندب أن يذبح بيده إن علم ذلك ) ؛ لأن الأولى في القرب أن يتولاها الإنسان بنفسه ، وإن أمر به غيره فلا يضر ؛ لأنه عليه الصلاة والسلام { ساق مائة بدنة فنحر منها بيده نيفا وستين ثم أعطى المدية عليا فنحر الباقي } ، وإن كان لا يحسن ذلك فالأفضل أن يستعين بغيره كي لا يجعلها ميتة ، ولكن ينبغي له أن يشهدها بنفسه { لقوله صلى الله عليه وسلم لفاطمة قومي فاشهدي أضحيتك فإنه يغفر لك بأول قطرة من دمها كل ذنب } .\n\n(Tabyeen al-Haqaaiq, 6/487, Ilmiyya)\n\n(Fatawa Rahimiyya, 10/28, Darul Isha'at)\n\n(Bahshti Zewar, 1/315-316, Zam Zam Publishers)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nMl.
