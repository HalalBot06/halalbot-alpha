  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf interest and insurance is haraam,then how can one buy a house without paying interest on the bond or paying insurance for it?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nInterest and insurance is indeed haram. The prohibition is expressly mentioned in the Quran and any ahadith.\n\nInsurance constitutes as two sins, interest and gambling. Gambling is also expressly prohibited in the Quran.\n\nOne may obtain and interest free loan and purchase a house or purchase a house based on the shari principle of purchasing and selling. An owner of a house may sell a house with profit. A purchaser may pay cash on terms as per mutual agreement.\n\nIf her cannot afford purchasing a house, simply do not do so. one may continue hiring a house and pay rent on that.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
