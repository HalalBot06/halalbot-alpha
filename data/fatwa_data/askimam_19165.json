  "question": "The Imam made me sit in the end row whilst in the Masjid",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDue to a knee injury, I offer my Salāh sitting on a chair. The other day, during Maghrib, I was sitting in the middle of the first row when the Imām came and asked me to sit at the end of the row. There was no space at the end of the first row so I had to go and and take a place in third row.  My question is why did the Imām ask me to sit at the end of the row. Is there any hadīth for this?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nThe Imām's request for you to sit at the end of the row was with a view to avoid inconveniencing others.\n\nThis was a valid request due to a number of reasons:\n\n \n\n*When a chair comes in the middle of the row, it usually causes a gap or extra space for those behind or around the chair.\n\n*Closing the gaps in the saff (row) would become more difficult for those praying next to the one sitting on a chair.\n\n*Should the Imām lose his wudū and need to pull forward a deputy Imām he cannot pull forward a person sitting on a chair. This is because the one sitting on a chair cannot lead those who are standing.\n\n*The Imām as the prayer leader has to ensure the rows are straight and properly aligned. If he believes there will be an issue with the chair in the middle of the row, then it is best to give him the benefit of the doubt.\n\n \n\nInsha-Allah you will receive double the reward for giving up your position in the first row to avoid inconveniencing others. This has been related to us in a hadīth. [i] [ii]\n\n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMl.
