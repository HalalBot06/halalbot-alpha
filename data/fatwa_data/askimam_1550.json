  "answer": "QUESTION\n.but thats the only job i got after so many years as me and my family needed the money. but i work in a different branch in which i only count money for people who request it that go on holiday. thats the job everyone does there, it does not invovle dealing with interest though natwest bank is like a normal bank and has many branches where interest is dealt with though we dont deal with it cos our department is a world travel service. is this still a sin?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta?ala says, ??And do not assist in sin.? (Maaidah)\n\nConventional banks deal in interest. To work in any branch of a conventional bank will be assisting in sin. However, if you are poor and needy and have to support yourself and your dependants, you may work there and make an effort to seek for an alternate Halaal employment.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
