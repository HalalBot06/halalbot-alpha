  "question": "In response to my question you said, to distribute Maulana Maududi’s book “Sunnat Ki A’ini Haisiyyat” for dawah purpose is inappropriate.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAfter your response I read the book once again and tried to see why you voted against it. I could not find any material contained therein that could be considered as inappropriate. On the contrary, I found the book an excellent scholarly response to the lies and fitna of munkir-e-hadith. Maulana Maududi with exceptionally good dalaeel brought the whole edifice of munkir-e-hadith crushing down on the floor I have yet not started giving out the book; I am waiting for you to please tell me why it is inappropriate to distribute Maududi?s\"Sunnat Ki A?ini Haisiyyat?? Thank you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMoulana Maududi did compile some very good books. However, after gaining popularity, he started expounding some views which were not appropriate. Distributing his books will led to promoting his personality and all his works including those that are not appropriate. (Refer attached)\n\nPeople may benefit from his good literature but there is a strong possibility of harms as well. It is important to protect and save the Ummat from the harms and inappropriate beliefs of Maududi. Literature on Munkar e Hadis is also written by many other reputable ulemas which can be distributed, for example \"Authority of Sunnah\" by Mufti Taqi Usmani.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
