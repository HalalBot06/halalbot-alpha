  "question": "Should a person do the istikhara by him/herself or should some other person do it for him/her?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThere is a holy man that i know whom people respect a lot and who is very religious. He has a 'gift' of knowing about the future just by closing his eyes and concentrating or working it out on a piece of paper. My mother trusts him explicitely and sought his help regarding a proposal. He asked the man's and his mother's name and through them he predicted that our marriage would not work out. Even though he is very religious and also has asked me to perform istikhara and read certain ayats but says that our future will remain dark if we go ahead with the marriage and no amount of praying will make it any easier. What should I do? I really love this man and he loves me and we want to get married but we also want to know God's will. We both want to do the istikhara but do not know whether we can trust our own understanding of the outcome the istikhara.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe knowledge of the future is best known to Allah Ta'ala alone. Others,\nbesides Allah Ta'ala, may predict the future based on indications and\ncalculations. That may be correct or incorrect.\n\nIn making major decisions, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised\nus to make Istikhaara (seek divine guidance), not to get the predictions of\npeople. However, Mashwarah may be made with reliable people. It is advisable\nfor one to place his trust in Allah Ta'ala and make Istikhaara himself. He\nmay request others as well to make Istikhaara.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
