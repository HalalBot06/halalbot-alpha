  "question": "What is the Fatwa of using pigs in medical research?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am offered a job in a pharmaceutical company. It involves testing the efficacy and toxic effects of new \"investigational\" or \"potential\" medication on several animal species. Usually, we use rats and mice but sometimes it might be necessary to use pigs and/or dogs. What is the ruling of using pigs in medical research? Jazak Allah Khairan for helping me on this issue. If possible, please include the daleel for the Fatwa. Salam alikum\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf there is a need to use animals, dogs and pigs, etc. for medical research\nand there is no alternative, then it is permissible to do medical research\non animals based on the principle that 'necessity relaxes prohibition'.\n(Ashbah Wan Nazaair; Ibn Nujaym)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
