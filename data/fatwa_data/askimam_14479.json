  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIn regards to the following saying of the holy prophet s.a.w: \"do not write down anything of me except the Quran. whoever writes down other then that should delete it\". (Ahmed, vol.1, pg171...also sahih muslim),\n\nI would like to know the context in which the prophet s.a.w made this statement and is this a justification for saying that the ahadith of the prophet s.a.w are not a part of deen?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is due to total ignorance and desire to follow one’s Nafs that would drive a man to reaching such a conclusion that the Mubaarak Ahaadith of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] are not part of Deen. The reason for the prohibition found in the above Hadith is that this was said by our beloved Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] in the earlier days of Islam where the noble Qur’aan were written on many different things and were kept by many people. The Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhu] at this time had not had that amount of experience with the Qur’aan to understand the style of its Aayaats.\n\nFor the above reason, there was a possibility that if the Ahaadith of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] had to be written down, the Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhu] would accidentally regard the Ahaadith of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] as part of the Qur’aan. Once the Sahaaba got used to the style of the Qur’aan and could distinguish between the Qur’aan and Ahaadith merely by reading them once. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] had permitted them to write down his Ahaadith. Imaam al-Tirmidhi [ra] had compiled a whole chapter of Ahaadith in his famous Tirmidhi in the section ‘Kitaabul Ilm’ regarding the permissibility of writing the Ahaadith of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam].
