  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it  permissible in Islam to have sex chat  with my  long distant fiancee, without risk of pregnancy,  given that  i have accepted her as my  wife and so has she and  i know that, 100% ,  whether I live or die, she will be my beloved wife.   \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThe concept of fiancé and fiancée is not recognized in Islam. It is either one is married or not. Any type of illegal communication with a woman out of marriage is haram in Shariah. It does not matter whether you have merely accepted the woman as your wife. The sex chat with her falls in the category of zina and it is a major sin. If you are certain in marrying that woman, do get married to her and your communication thereafter will be permissible. It is permissible to marry a woman at a distance by proxy. Kindly refer to fatwa http://www.askimam.org/fatwa/fatwa.php?askid=ef6e2081b7ee1f7b3700b0899ce5986f\n\n\nAlso see : http://www.askimam.org/fatwa/fatwa.php?askid=acca62cc714d9a22f6c16c76f139dcc6 \n\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
