  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam Alaikum I have the following two queries please send me the reply asap. 1)In dhuhar Salat after 4 fardh rakat there are 2 compulsory sunnat rakat which has to be prayed after the fardh salat, can we read this 2 sunnat rakat before fardh salat? 2) Sometime what happens due to some busy work I could not offer the 4 compulsory sunnat of dhuhar, which is before 4 fardh salat, I directly joined the fardh salaat immediately. Can I pray this 4 sunnat after the fardh salat? If I left this 4 sunnat is there any sin? Allah hafiz\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The two Rakaats of Sunnat-e-Muakkadah after Dhuhr Salaat cannot be performed before the Fardh Salaat of Dhuhr. They must be performed after the Dhuhr Salaat. (Nurul Iedhaah pg.96; Imdadiyyah)\n\n2. It is necessary to make up for the missed four Rakaats of Sunnat before Dhuhr Salaat after the Fardh of Dhuhr Salaat. (Ahsanul Fataawa vol.3 pg.456, 457; HM Saeed)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
