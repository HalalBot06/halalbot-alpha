  "question": "Is it allowed according to Islam to eat the usual meat which is available in the markets of America?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe Holy Quran mentions to eat the food of the Ahlul-Kitaab. So is it a right practice to consume their meat (i.e. slaughtered by them)? If the answer to the above question is NO, so please give me a detailed explanation to the Fatwa which could be easily explainable to the others.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Taala says in the Noble Quran:%0D%0A%0D%0A'Today I have made permissible for you pure things and the food of those who were given the Book (Ahlul-Kitaab) is also Halal for you'.%0D%0A(Quran Al-Maida 5:4)%0D%0A%0D%0AOvertly the above ayat reads that the Zabeeha of the Ahlul-Kitaab is permissible, but the fundamental principle must be understood in%0D%0Aorder to understand the Quran i.e. 'One part of the Quran explains the other'. Therefore, this verse should be understood in the light of%0D%0Aanother verse relating to the same matter: 'Do not eat unless Allah's name has been taken and this (not taking Allah's name) practice is%0D%0Atransgression' (Quran Al-Ana'am 6:121)%0D%0A%0D%0AWhile the former verse explicitly states that the Zabeeha of the Ahlul-Kitaab is permissible and the latter says, 'Do not eat unless Allah's%0D%0Aname has been mentioned.' In the light of both these verses, it is understood that the Zabeeha of the Ahlul-kitaab is permissible only if%0D%0Athe name of Allah is mentioned at the time of slaughter. The Ahlul-kitaab used to mention Allah's name when slaughtering an animal,%0D%0Atherefore, their Zabeeha was also halal for Muslims. It is for this same reason that an animal slaughtered by the Mushrikeen, etc. is not%0D%0Apermissible. The Ahlul-kitaab of today are recognized by name, less faith. There is no guarantee that they take the name of Allah%2FGod%0D%0Awhen slaughtering an animal. Furthermore, they cannot be trusted anymore in matters pertaining to Halal-Haram.%0D%0A%0D%0ASo there is uncertainty in the above slaughter manner. Also the Jurists are unanimous that it is not permissible to consume meat which%0D%0Ais doubtful. Only if there is certainty that the Ahlul-kitaab read the 'Tasmiyah' i.e. mentioned the name of God when slaughtering an%0D%0Aanimal, will the meat from their slaughter be permissible. %0D%0A%0D%0AWe suggest that the Muslims in the U.S.A. and U.K. slaughter the animals themselves. A committee be appointed and look into ways to%0D%0Afacilitate for Halal meat slaughtered by Muslims. %0D%0A%0D%0AAnother option may be that the meat sold on the market are packed, sealed and stamped by a Muslim organization consisting of reliable%0D%0Ascholars and Ulama who have proper Islamic knowledge of the principles pertaining to Halal%2FHaram of the Shariah.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Taala Knows Best.%0D%0A%0D%0ABy Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0AAlbalagh Note (http:%2F%2Fwww.albalagh.net%2F): A simple and very effective means of guaranteeing halal status of all foods would be to insist on%0D%0AHalal Certification. The Islamic Food And Nutritional Council of America (IFANCA) does have a Halal Certification program and their%0D%0Aapproved items contain the Halal M stamp on the package. Now it is up to the Muslim consumers living in north America to demand this%0D%0Astamp from all the suppliers and put these issue to bed once for all.
