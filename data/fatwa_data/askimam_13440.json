  "question": "How a born non-muslim is supposed to know about the Deen-e-Haq or the Haq baat",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nHow a born non-muslim is supposed to know about the Deen-e-Haq or the Haq baat (or What is right and what is wrong etc.)?\n\n2- Do children remain on the religion of their Parents (forever)?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\na. Allah Ta’ala has created the entire world and its contents out of His power and Might. Every creature, living or non-living, dry or succulent, proves the Greatness and Oneness of Allah. Hadhrat Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) is reported to have said, ‘In every existing creature of the earth is a sign that proves Allah’s Oneness.’ Ibraahim (Alayhis salaam) was not taught by anyone the Deen-e-Haqq. By mere pondering and seeing the signs and creations of Allah, he recognized the truth. He looked at the sun, moon and stars and said, ‘Verily, I supplicate and turn my attention towards the Lord Who created these creations.’\n\nIt is said that Imaam Abu Hanifa (RA) said, ‘If Deen-e-Haqq was not taught by anyone, it is the right of every intelligent person to turn and worship Allah by pondering and seeing His signs and powers.’ Therefore, in our times, when Deen-e-Haqq is exposed by means of literature, lectures and the media, one can easily be channeled to Deen-e-Haqq and the truth.\n\nb. In Bukhari Shareef, a Hadith is mentioned that every new born baby is born on Fitrah (Islam). Thereafter, the parents make him a Jew and Christian.\n\nIn view of the above Hadith, the child (until reaches the age of understanding) remains a Muslim. However, once the child reaches the age of understanding he shall be responsible to recognize the Deen-e-Haqq (true religion) and follow the true religion of Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
