  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. When I am praying with jamaat(e.g fajr prayer) but missed one rakaah, and while I am completing one rakaah, a brother who follows Shafii Madhab joins with me(making me the imam). Do I have to start reciting the Surahs loudly or I should pray as normal. 2. If one goes in Musalla(e.g in our university) at Asr time where we are using the Shafii time for Asr. And people start forcing the person who follows Hanafi madhab to lead. Is it permissible to lead and if not what should be done to avoid such a situation? Please remember me in your Duaas.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is not permissible for a Masbooq (latecomer) to be an Imaam in the Rakaats that have been missed. Hence, your Salaat should be completed as normal, i.e. Qiraat should be read softly. (Shaami vol.1 pg.597; HM Saeed)\n\n2. It is permissible for a Hanafi to perform Asr Salaat at Shaafi?ee time in a place that is dominated by followers of the Shaafi?ee Madhab.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
