  "answer": "QUESTION\nI'm not fasting due to pregnancy and have recently been informed that I have to pay fidyah along with making up the missed days of fasting. Last year I was also pregnant during Ramadaan and didn't pay fidyah. Now that I know; do I have to pay last years fidyah also. Jazaakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf you are a follower of the Hanafi Madhab, you are not required to pay\nFidyah. Only Qadhaa of the missed fasts is required.\n\nHowever, according to the Shaaf'ee Madhab, if one has failed to make up the\nmissed fasts until the next Ramadhaan, he has to pay Fidyah together with\nmaking up the missed fasts.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
