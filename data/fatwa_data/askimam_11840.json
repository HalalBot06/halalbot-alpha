  "question": "Is nikah still valid without sexual intercourse for 6 months.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamulaikum Mufti Sahab, I have been married for the last six months. After marriage I didn't get a chance to live with my wife for long. She joined me after about one and half month. She had absolutely no idea of what sex is all about. Not that she is from a uneducated family. She is from a well educated family and she herself is a Computer Science graduate. I don't know if she really didn't knew or was just trying to avoid me. But I counselled her for a long long time. With a lot of sabar I explained her everything but still I don't think she accepts the fact that it is a natural act and it is for the pleasure of both the partners. Now again for the last one month she is in India with her parents and I don't know when she will be coming back. I heard from somebody that if you do not have sexual intercourse for more than six months after nikah then the nikah is not valid. My question is, is our nikah still valid? We tried to have intercourse a couple of times but never successful as she feels pain and doesn't cooperate with me. I think there is some problem with her as she doesn't get the slightest excitment, so I asked her to consult a doctor but she doesn't care for my word. Please advice me what to do. I am very deppressed now. Jazakallah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour Nikah is valid in spite of your wife not co-operating with you.\n\nYou should discuss the matter with some senior members of her family and request them to intervene in the matter.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
