  "answer": "QUESTION\nA) My family owns a clothes shop, and they sell clothes which are short clothes for women and girls, the women and girls use this clothes which shows the awrah (the parts of the body which must be covered). Is the money which they earn halal?, I also would like to ask, But if its not allowed can people use such clothing under their hijab? Is the money halal then?. B) How many men are required to pray jamaat? C) I heard that when Eesa(as) will come during the time of dajjal people will fight with swords and the 70.000 jews from Isfahan will have black robes and swords. My question is what you think of this, because today people do not use swords very much, instead of swords they use guns.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In principle, if a dealer is certain that a particular item will be used in sin, then it is not permissible for him to sell the item as that is assisting in sin. If the dealer does not know whether the item will be used in sin or not, then he is not responsible. It is not his responsibility to enquire either. The income of such items will be permissible.\n\n2. Two men are sufficient to make a Jamat. In Jumu?ah, four men are required to make a Jamaat.\n\n3. In principle, we should understand the literal meaning of the Hadith. It is possible swords will be used at that time as conventional arms may not be available for whatever reason. If they use guns at that time, then only will we understand swords to be guns meant in the Hadith. There were no guns at the time of Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam]. He advised the Sahaaba [Radhiallaahu anhum] according to their level of understanding.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
