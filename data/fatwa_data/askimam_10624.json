  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have read in a number of places that when a man divorces his wife and then refuses the responsibility of the kids, it is said that she should sacrifice her life for them?Please clarify this for me.Does it mean she cannot get married again?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA divorcee may marry another person after her Iddat (waiting period after divorce) even though she has children. However, the abovementioned principle should be considered in the context of prevailing circumstances. %0D%0A%0D%0AIn a divorce, if the father or other members of the family refuse to accept responsibility of the children, then there will be no one to take care of the children besides the mother. If she remarries, her husband who is not the biological father of her children, there is no guarantee how he will treat her children. If her husband is selfish, that can be very harmful to her children. It is, therefore, important for a divorcee to consider her options very carefully before committing to marriage. She should strongly consider the welfare of her children. %0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has given glad tiding to a widow who sacrifices her life behind her children and do not remarry. He stated that he and such a woman will be like this (Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] indicated towards the forefinger and middle finger) in Jannah. This is an expression of closeness in honour of her sacrifices in upbringing her children.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
