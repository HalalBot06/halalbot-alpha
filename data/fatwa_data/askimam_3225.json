  "question": "Pakistani families follow \"caste\" system, (Kaum), Why is this wrong?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn Pakistan, there is a \"caste\" system for families and many will only marry within caste (e.g. Choudhary, Butt etc). However, this only reflects family heritage. If our Holy Prophet (SAWS) was from the Honorable Tribe of Quresh, which also represents a family heritage, then why are Pakistani people criticised for following their heritage? Awaiting your reply. Jazakallah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not prohibited for a person to marry within his heritage. However, it\nis prohibited for a person of any heritage or caste to regard themselves as\nsuperior and look down upon others.\n\nAllah Ta'ala says, 'Verily the most honoured among you is the most pious among you.'\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
