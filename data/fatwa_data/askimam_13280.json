  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is oyur opinion about sheikh asim from madni mosque montreal ,canada? What is the ajar for praying one salat in masjid ul haram and masjid-e-nabawi?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. I have met Moulana (Sheikh Asim) a few years ago in Regina in the State of Saskatchewan and conducted programmes with him. Moulana Asim is a reliable Aalim of Deen and is primarily engaged in the field of Daâ€™awah and Tabligh. The above is my general opinion about Moulana Asim. I cannot comment on any other specific aspect of Moulana Asim which I do not know of.\n\n2. The reward for performing one Fardh Salaat in Musjidul Haram is equivalent to 100,000 Salaats and the reward for performing one Fardh Salaat in Musjid-Nabawiy is 50,000 Salaats.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
