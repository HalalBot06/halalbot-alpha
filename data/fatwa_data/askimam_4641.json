  "question": "Can a married man masturbate?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a married man with two lovely children with a loving and caring wife. However I haven?t been finding my wife sexually attractive, so I masturbate while thinking of other attractive women. This has been going on for several years now. My wife doesn?t know this. I do have intercourse with her, while thinking of other women. I don?t know what to do, you advised that it?s haram to masturbate. Our marriage was arranged. My wife is kind and very beautiful and recently became deeply religious. May Allah bless you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou stated that your wife is very beautiful but you also stated that she is\nnot sexually attractive and that leads you to fantasise and masturbate.\n\nIt is Haraam (strictly prohibited) for a person to fantasise about other\nwoman and to masturbate. We advise you apply wisdom and communicate your\nfeelings towards your wife being beautiful but not sexually attractive and\nthat she should make necessary adjustments in order to fulfill your desires.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
