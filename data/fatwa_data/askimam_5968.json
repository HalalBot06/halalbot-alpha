  "answer": "QUESTION\nFirsty, I am in love with a girl, and want to marry her for Allah's sake since I think I can sincerely teach her the correct way. Since, we do not have a relationship at all, is that good? Secondly, is there a strong dua to which I can follow so that marriage to the girl is possible, since I love her?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMarriage is a major step in one's life and extreme precaution should be\ntaken in choosing a marriage partner.\n\nOne should not resolve to marry a person simply because he 'loves' her. We\nadvise you discuss your choice with your parents and seniors and seek their\nadvise as well. You should always take the guidance of your seniors in such\nmatters.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
