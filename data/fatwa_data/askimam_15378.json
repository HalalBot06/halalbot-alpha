  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nYou have said in your answers that the jamaat tabligh is a righteous jamaat. Still I find some things that they do against the common sense. For example\na. they do not use speakers for congregational prayers.\nb. they do not use the modern technologies for the propagation of Islam. i.e. the internat etc.\nc. They still keep link with their jamaats in different parts of the world through lettters.\nPlease clarify.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nHow would one account for those engaged in tabligh traveling in planes around the world? Very often their tickets are booked via the internet.\n\n \n\nOur institute is closely associated with Dawah and Tabligh and is named, under the great leader and personality of Dawah and Tabligh, Hazrat Mawlana Inaamul Hasan Saheb Rahmatullahi Alaih. We serve 1000s of people through the internet through this site while also being associated with Dawah and Tabligh.\n\n \n\nIf anyone does not use speakers for congregational salaah or communicates through snail mail, that has nothing to do with Tabligh Jamaat. It is their individual choice and practice.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
