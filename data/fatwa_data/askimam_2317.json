  "question": "What is the procedure for dealing with a person who has left Islam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA person who has turned renegade in an Islamic state should be imprisoned\nfor 3 days by the state. The state will be responsible to dispel all his\ndoubts. If he repents, then he will be released from prison.\n\nIf he still rejects Islam, then he will be beheaded. However, in a\nnon-Islamic state no legal action can be meted out to him, appropriate\nmeasures should be taken to dispel his doubts and convincing him to revert\nto Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
