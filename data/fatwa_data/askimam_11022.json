  "question": "I mentioned the following statement to my wife : \"If you go home don't come back \" My intention was not Divorce , I merely wanted to threaten her. IS IT a Divorce?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMuhammad 073 153 7689\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe statement to your wife, ?If you go home, don?t come back is Kinaayah (indicative and not express)?.\n\nIf you did not have the intention of issuing her divorce at the time of making that statement, then that will not constitute Talaaq. However, it is not appropriate for you to threaten your wife with such a statement.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
