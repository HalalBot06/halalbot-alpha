  "question": "I am a relatively recent revert to Islam and I would like to change my name to an Islamic one. What is an appropriate way to choose a name?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have 2 questions, firstly what is an appropriate way to choose a name, I have a book of Muslim names and their meanings but I do not want to feel as though I have annointed myself with attributes of a name which are undeserved. I also wish to change my surname as I have no desire to keep a name which reflects my parents atheist convictions or western style. How do I choose an appropriate surname?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNAMING THE CHILD%0D%0AIt is the infant's vested right to be honoured with a good name. When%0D%0Achoosing a name for the child, it should be done with the intention that the%0D%0Achild will be blessed with the barakah of that name. Here are some Ahadeeth%0D%0Ato show the importance of selecting a good and correct name:%0D%0A%0D%0AIbne Umar (RA) relates Rasoolullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) as saying:%0D%0A\"Truly, the most loved of your names by Allah are Abdullah and%0D%0AAbdur-Rahmaan.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is also reported in the Aboo Dawood that Rasoolullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam) said: \"Keep the names of prophets. And the most desirable names by%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala are Abdullah and Abdur-Rahmaan. And names that depict honesty%0D%0Aare Haarith (planter) and Hammaam (thoughtful). And the most disliked ones%0D%0Aare Harb (battle) and Murrah (bitter).%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE BARAKAH OF NAMING A CHILD AFTER THE BELOVED NAME OF RASOOLULLAN%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said: \"Whoever is named after me%0D%0Awith the hope of being blessed, he will be blessed and will be in peace till%0D%0Athe day of Qiyaamat.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AHe also said: \"To whomever is born a boy and he names him Muhammad solely%0D%0Afor the love of me and for the blessings of my name, then both he (the%0D%0Afather) and his son will enter Jannah.\"%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING GOOD NAMES%0D%0AHADITH: \"On the Day of Qiyaamah you will be called by your (own) names and%0D%0Athe names of your fathers. Therefore keep good names.\" Aboo Dawood.%0D%0AHADITH: \"To whoever is born a child, the child should be given a good name%0D%0Aand sound education. And when he becomes of age he should be married.\"%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AIt Was Rasoolullah's (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) practice to enquire the%0D%0Anames of persons and villages. If they were pleasant, it became apparent on%0D%0Ahis face. If not, his displeasure could be seen.%0D%0A%0D%0AOnce Rasoolullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) called for a volunteer to%0D%0Amilk a camel. Four persons volunteered: he refused to accept the services of%0D%0Athe first three because their names did not imply pleasantness. The names of%0D%0Athe first two were Murrah (bitter) while Jamrah (burning coal) was the name%0D%0Aof the third person. When the fourth said his name is Yaeesh (long live)%0D%0ARasoolullah sallallaahu-alayhi-wasallam said to him: \"Milk her.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AUNDESIRABLE NAMES SHOULD BE CHANGED%0D%0AAa'ishah (RA) reports that Rasool sallallaahu-alayhi-wasallam used to change%0D%0Adispleasing names replacing them with good names. Abdullah bin Umar (RA)%0D%0Arelates that one of his sisters was named Aasiyah (disobedient).%0D%0ARasoolullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) changed it to Jameelah%0D%0A(beautiful). Zainab (RA) says that I had been named Birrah (pious).%0D%0ARasoolullah sallallaahu-alayhi-wasallam said: \"Do not claim piety for Allah%0D%0Aknows best who amongst you are pious. Name her Zainab!\"%0D%0A%0D%0ANAMES MAY INFLUENCE THE LIVES OF PEOPLE%0D%0ASa'eed ibne Musayib (RA) relates from his father that his grandfather went%0D%0Ato Rasoolullah sallallaahu-alayhi-wasallam and was asked: \"What is your%0D%0Aname?\" He replied: \"Hazn\" (sorrow). Rasoolullah sallallaahu-alayhi-wasallam%0D%0Asaid: \"You are Sahl.\" (contended). He replied: \"I will not change the name%0D%0Amy father had given me.\" The narrator says that thereafter sorrow%0D%0Acontinually remained with them.%0D%0A%0D%0AKEEP AWAY FROM NAMES IMPLYING SHIRK%0D%0AAs Muslims, we should always abstain from keeping names implying any%0D%0Aelements of Shirk, like adjoining the word 'Abd'(servant) to names or%0D%0Aepithets other that those of Allah Ta'ala. Rasoolullah%0D%0Asallallaahu-alayhi-wasallam also forbade keeping pompous and selfglorifying%0D%0Anames, for this reveals arrogance and haughtiness - human elements most%0D%0Aabhorred by Allah Ta'ala.%0D%0A%0D%0ABE PROUD OF YOUR IDENTITY AND FAITH%0D%0AMuslims should always be proud of their identity and faith. Nowadays, to%0D%0Aconceal his identity, it is common practice for a person to 'westernize' his%0D%0Aname, like substituting Yoosuf with Joe or Joseph, Sulaimaan with Solly or%0D%0ASully, Faatimah with Fatli, Sumay-yah with Summi, etc. Efforts to distort%0D%0Asuch beautiful names merely reveal an un-Islamic and sacreligious attitude.%0D%0ARemember, there exists behind each Islamic name an Islamic spirit and%0D%0Ameaning, which, when distorted, is ruined. For example, there is intended%0D%0Alove for the Prophet of Islam, and barakah when naming a child Muhammad. But%0D%0Awhen Muhammad is called Mahmad or Gammat, this spirit of love for%0D%0ARasoolullah sallallaahu-alayhi-wasallam and the acquiring of barakah by such%0D%0Aa name is shattered. Should we not then refrain from such sacreligious%0D%0Apractices?%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala guide us so that we may realize the beauty and uniqueness%0D%0Aof the religion of Islam propounded by no other than the one who is the best%0D%0Aof Allah's creations-May Allah shower His choicest blessings upon him.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala guide us on the Right Path.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay He also grant this humble effort of mine to be a fulfilment of a%0D%0Along-felt need amongst the Muslims-especially the English-speaking Muslims.%0D%0AAmeen.%0D%0A%0D%0ANames for Muslim Children%0D%0ABy M Rafeeq Hathurani%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0ANAMES FOR MUSLIM CHILDREN%0D%0APsychologists now apprehend the wisdom of the effect a person?s name has on his life. But Muhammad (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) had revealed this fact to his followers already 1400 years ago. His teaching to his followers was that children should be given good names, and that meaningless names and those having unsavoury connotations should be avoided. Subsequently, we find many incidents mentioned in the Hadith where Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) changed the names of people with this object.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnother aspect of a person?s name is that it bespeaks a person?s religion. Hence, the name of a Muslim is usually of such a nature that by the mere mention of it, the listener understands that the person so addressed, is a Muslim. It is for this reason that our elders laid great emphasis on keeping good and pleasant names.%0D%0A%0D%0ABut since the widespread of Western culture throughout the world, it has become customary amongst Muslims not to take into cognisance the meaning of the name when naming a child. Many do not even bother to ascertain whether it is permissible for one to keep such a name or not. Often, even if the name is correct and suitable, then by way of abbreviating it, its Islamic connotation is distorted. In fact, at times it even become unlawful to address one by such a name. For example, Abdur-Rahmaan is called Rahmaan; Abdur-Razzaaq, Razaaq; Abdul-Wahhaab, Wahhaab ? whereas Rahmaan, Razzaaq and Wahhaab are the exclusive epithets of Allah Ta?ala. To address any creation by such a name, is therefore unlawful.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhile this disease is rampant in the entire Muslims World, it is more in vogue in South Africa: Sulaymaan is called Solly; Yoosuf is called Joosub, Essop or Joe; Uthman is called Ossy, etc. In this way the blessed names of the Anbiyaa (alayhimus-salaam) and Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) are distorted and needlessly rendered meaningless. Moreover, one may never know whether the one so addressed is a Muslim or not.%0D%0A%0D%0AHence, with regards naming children, there was a need for compiling a book wherein all misconceptions could be eradicated and guidance could be given as to the importance of giving correct and meaningful names. Alhamdulillah, respect Brother, Moulana Qaree Muhammad Rafeeq, teacher at Madrasah Islamia, Lenasia has fulfilled this need proficiently in the pages to follow. The respected compiler has in his introduction explained most ably the Islamic teachings regarding a new-born child. The Masaail pertaining to Tahneek, Adhaan, Du?aas, circumcision, naming a child ? and many more ? have been explained in detail. Apart from having compiled a book on Muslim names in an alphabetic order, he has also rendered their meanings and their literal and historical aspects as well. During my tour of South Africa, I have had a cursory perusal of the book from various portions and found it to be most invaluable. In my opinion it should find its place into the home of every Muslim ? that no family should remain without it.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta?ala grant the compiler the best of rewards in both the worlds for the services rendered by him, and may He also grant this book acceptance and grant him the guidance to render more and greater service of this nature, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0AMuhammad Taqee Uthmaani%0D%0AServant of the Students%0D%0ADarul-Uloom, Karachi%0D%0A%0D%0A"
