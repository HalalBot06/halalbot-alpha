  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf a husband arugues with wife and during the argument says \"i don't need you\" is this a talak, even though no intention was made for talak.\n\nAlso if husband says \"I give you divorce\" and confirms that he has given divorce by saying \"their I have given it \" but was refering to the one divorce he gave does that constitute a second divorce\n\nMy third question is if a discussion was taking place between husband & wife about when divorce takes place and the husband says during the discussion \"if I say for example I divorce you divorce takes place\" even though it was a discussion with no intention whatsoever to divorce does divorce take place\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n1) The statement \"I dont need you\" will only constitute a divorce when the husband makes the intention of divorce. These words are \"KINAYAH\"- ambigous words which will only constitute a divorce when the intention of divorce is made.\n\n \n\n2)This will not constitute a 2nd Divorce.This will be considered as a referal to the 1st Divorce, IKHBAAR(Reconfirming the 1st divorce), NOT INSHAA (Instituting a new divorce).\n\n\n3) The statement of \"if I say for example I divorce you divorce takes place\"  will not constitute a divorce. This is just said by way of example, NOT as the husband is instituting a divorce.\n\n \n\nكتاب الطلاق\n\n قال : لست امرأتي وقع إن نوى و لو زاد : و الله لا و إن نوى لاحتمال الأول الإنشاء و في الثاني تمحض للإخبار\n\nالاشباه و النظائر ص 491 دار الفكر\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
