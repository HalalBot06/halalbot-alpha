  "question": "what is the best of asking dua after salat as i read in hadith that we should not exceed boundries while making dua",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe best manner of making dua after salah is to make a dua on ones own silently, following the etiquettes of dua and asking your needs of Allah from your heart, with full conviction of Allah accepting the Dua.\n\nWhat is meant by not exceeding the boundaries in Dua is that one should not go into unnecessary detail, e.g. asking for a certain type of palace in a certain place in Jannah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
