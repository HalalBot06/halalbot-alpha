  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAlhamdulillah, firstly i would like to thank  ALLAH TAA'LA for selecting u all people for spreading islam. i ask  ALLAH TAA'LA to give u more strength for doing such a good job AAMIN.\n\n1)in islam is it permissable for a women to go to other state & stay there in hostel & complete her P.G?\n\n2)is it permissable to read QURAA'N during the makrooh time?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nJazakallah for your kind words and duas. We cannot do anything without the tawfeeq of Allah.\n\n1. Your question is general and therefore our response will also be general. A woman may travel to another state with her mahram. She cannot travel by herself. She may stay there by herself on condition there is no fear of fitna. If there is a fear of fitna, then it is not permissible for her to stay by herself.\n2. There is no time restriction for reciting the Quran. Quran may be recited during makrooh times of salah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
