  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu alikum. When a Muslim always prays God for getting his blessing to join Jannat. But what he should do for his recreation. The Ulema says I should not watch T.V, moovies and should not go to clubs for my recreation. What is exactly Islam says about the recreation of a Muslim\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nRecreation in Islam is permitted as long as it is within the parameters of\nthe Shariah. Recreation can take different forms, e.g. take walk in the\npark. That is not only relaxing but it gives one the opportunity to ponder\nover the creation of Allah. Going to clubs and watching TV fall out of the\nbounds of the shariah.\n\nKindly refer attached - Poison Box\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
