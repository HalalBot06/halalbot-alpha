  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti.Assalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu. Please detail what I have to do if Imam already Ruku' but I am still not finish recitng Fatiha. Please answer the above question in respect to Syafiee Madhab. Can I continue reciting Fatiha even Iman already make Sujud. Or can I follow the Imam Ruku's without completing my Fatiha reciting. May Allah forgive us all. Was Salaam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOne should try to read Surah Faatiha in a fast pace. If the Imaam is in Ruku or Qawmah or in the first or second Sajdah, one should complete Surah Faatiha and then catch up with him. (Fiqhul Islaam pg.1257)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
