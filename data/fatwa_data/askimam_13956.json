  "question": "can we cut our nails, hairs on thursdays' & at the time or after the time of magrib?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy first question is that can we cut our nails, hairs on thursdays' & at the time or after the time of magrib?\n\nAnd the second Q is with respect to earlier one in which you told that the pants can be and should be folded above the ankles, but here in India a good proportion of Sunni muslims say that you should fold the pants in only one way and not the other i.e they say that you should fold the pants in such a way that the inside cloth should not be seen outside. Is there any such refference in Hadees?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. There is no restriction in Shari’ah for clipping one’s nails and hair on Thursdays at Maghrib time.\n\n2. It is not permissible to wear pants that flow below the ankles. If one wears such pants, it should be folded up. It does not matter which way the pants are folded, inwardly or outwardly. There is no reference in theHadith to fold the pants inwardly.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
