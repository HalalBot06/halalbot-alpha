  "answer": "QUESTION\nplease could you tell me if my nikah is vaild. I was pressured to marry my cousin. i was confused and undecisive and bascially got married to him. whilst the imam asked me if i wanted to him i spoke to Allah swt saying ya Allah i dont accept this nikah in my heart however i verbally have to say yes. does this mean my nikah is invaild.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf you gave verbal consent to performing your Nikah, then your Nikah is valid if it was performed in the presence of, at least, two Muslim males or one Muslim male and two Muslim females.\n\nA responsible person should not commit to something he/she is not sure about, especially, in major issues like Nikah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
