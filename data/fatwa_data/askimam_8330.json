  "question": "If my family is dealing with some interest-related transactions in the family business then will I be eating Haram also?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI'm a 22 year old student and am currently dependant upon my family in terms of expenditure etc. What can I do to prevent them & myself from the evil of interest. Though I know that my father is earnestly trying to get rid of this evil. A few years back we did not deal with interest at all. But once we got into it due to a loan for a new factory, we have been sucked into this evil, due to which there is no barkat in any of our dealings. Please advise me what should I do.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the details of your question, your father is paying interest and not earning interest, while an interest bearing loan is prohibited, the income from the business will not be Haraam. Your eating at hom will be Halaal.\n\nYou state your father is sincerely trying to come out from the burden of paying interest, you should also assist your father in doing so by consulting any senior Mufti in Pakistan, like Mufti Taqi Usmani Saheb and present the situation to him for his advice and guidance. May Allah Ta?ala grant you Barkaat and peace, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
