  "answer": "QUESTION\nI read from your site that when one has a wet dream and some of the sperm comes in contact with the bed then when the sperm drys up then if you then come into contact with it then we will not have to perform ghusl again.what about the clothes if the sperm in the clothes drys up then if someone who does not know that there is sperm in it then washes the clothes then will he/she have to perform ghusl.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBasically, one needs to understand that by any impurity coming in contact with one?s clothing, Ghusl does not necessarily become Waajib.\n\nIn the above case, Ghusl will not become Waajib except if sperm was ejaculated by that very person.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
