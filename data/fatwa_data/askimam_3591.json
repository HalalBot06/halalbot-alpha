  "question": "What is the justification, in Islam, of women wearing black, and men wearing white in some Arab countries?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs salaam wa'alaikum, I don't mean for this question to be provocative. I'd just like to know, what is the reason from Quran or Sunnah, that women should wear black abbayas and men white clothes in Arab countries like Saudi Arabia. Its so hot over there anyway, and black is the colour that absorbs the most sunlight, so its even hotter for the women. Can't they wear white, like the men, as long as it's not see-through? Or is the colour of the clothes just Arabian custom? My second question is about Ghusl. Sometimes, after passing stools, there is a thick white liquid that comes out of my member. Does this necessitate a Ghusl? Jazak Allah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. When a female leaves her home due to necessity, she should cover herself\nby concealing the form and shape of her body. For that, the outer garment\nshould be thick and loose. As regards the colour of the outer garment, there\nis no restriction. That may be any colour as long as it is not attractive.\n2. It is permissible for a male to wear any colour garment on condition the\ncolour is not a feminine. However, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)\nrecommended men wearing white garments.\n3. The secretion of the white liquid does not necessitate Ghusl.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
