  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalam alaikum,\n\nThanks for providing invaluable information about Islam through your website. People are benefited by your noble efforts. I have two questions to ask.\n\n1.       Recently I read an article in Gulf news, about the fatwa issued by a scholar in Saudi Arabia relating to driving license for women in Saudi Arabia. The issue is bit complicated to understand; besides this has been published in news papers without substantiating it. Due to this many people have wrong notion about Islam. Please click the link to read in detail:http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/saudi-women-use-fatwa-in-driving-bid-1.643431.\n\nThe summary of the article is mentioned below incase the link doesn’t work.\n\nRiyadh: Saudi women plan to turn a controversial fatwa (religious ruling) to their advantage and launch a campaign to achieve their long-standing demand to drive in this conservative kingdom.\n\nIf the demand is not met, the women threatened to follow through the fatwa which allows them to breastfeed their drivers and turn them into their sons.\n\nThe campaign will be launched under the slogan: \"We either be allowed to drive or breastfeed foreigners,\" a journalist told Gulf News.\n\nAmal Zahid said that their decision follows a fatwa issued by a renowned scholar which said that Saudi women can breastfeed their foreign drivers for them to become their sons.\n\n\"As every Saudi family needs a driver, our campaign will focus on women's right to drive,\" she said.\n\nThe controversial fatwa, which was regarded as both funny and weird, issued recently by Shaikh Abdul Mohsin Bin Nasser Al Obaikan, member of Saudi Council of Senior Scholars and adviser to the king, has sparked a debate in society.\n\nThe renowned scholar said Saudi women can breastfeed their foreign drivers for them to be become their sons and brothers to their daughters.\n\nUnder this relationship, foreign drivers can mix freely with all members of the family without breaking the Islamic rule which does not allow mixing of genders.\n\nBreast milk kinship is considered to be as good as a blood relationship in Islam.\n\n\"A woman can breastfeed a mature man so that he becomes her son. In this way, he can mix with her and her daughters without violating the teachings of Islam,\" the scholar said.\n\n‘Ridiculous and weird'\n\nAl Obaikan based his fatwa on a Hadith (saying) of the Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) which was narrated by Salim, the servant of Abu Huzaifa.\n\nLater, Al Obaikan clarified that his fatwa was being distorted by the local media which ignored the condition that the milk should be drawn out of the woman and given to the man in a cup to drink.\n\n\nSpeaking to Gulf News, a number of Saudi women condemned the fatwa. Fatima Al Shammary was quoted by the local Arabic daily Al Watan as saying the fatwa was \"ridiculous and weird\".\n\n\"This fatwa has become a hot topic of debate among women. Is this is all that is left to us to do: to give our breasts to the foreign drivers?\" she said.\n\nAnother Saudi woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, questioned: \"Does Islam allow me to breastfeed a foreign man and prevent me from driving my own car?\n\n\"I have not breastfed my own children. How do you expect me to do this with a foreign man? What is this nonsense?\" she said.\n\nAnother woman said the fatwa should also apply to the husbands who should be breastfed by housemaids. By doing so, all will be brothers and sisters,\" she said.\n\nHamid Al Ali, a journalist for an electronic newspaper, recalled that an Egyptian driver who had a crush on a female teacher he drives to school asked her to breastfeed him. When she retorted angrily, he said: \"I want to be your son.\"\n\nSaudi writer Suzan Al Mashhadi sarcastically asked Al Obaikan: \"Do the women have to breastfeed the driver in the presence of their husbands or can they do this alone?\"\n\n\"Who will protect the wife if the husband entered the house unexpectedly and found his wife breastfeeding the driver?\" she asked.\n\nI understand that the fatwa has been clarified, but still I am quite confused & not convinced & I believe people are misleading due to this. What is your opinion, Should women be allowed to get a driving license. Could you please clarify me.\n\n2.     My second question, One of my friend wants to clarify himself regarding the below topics.\n\na)He heard that Moulana Ashraf ali Thanvi (R.A) died in toilet. Which he says is the result/sign of sinful acts done in life (Astaghfirulllah).Coz the person will be raised alive during qiyamah in the same condition in what he dies.\n\nb) Hazrath Junaid Baghdadi(R.A) was crossing a river along with his mureed, the mureed started saying “ ya allah” “ya allah” but he was sinking, then hazrath junaid(R.A) told him, you have not yet reached to my level, how can you get help from allah, so say, “Ya junaid” “Ya junaid” & he was rescued. He doesn’t have the source from which book he has read. He wants to know how far this is authentic. If it is authentic, could you please interpret it?\n\n\nPlease reply to my questions, I will be very thankful to you,\n\n \n\nJazakallah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nShaikh Ubaikān has been refuted on this matter in many articles from other senior Ulama’. Regarding women’s driving issue, we recommend you to contact local Ulama’\n\n \n\nWhat your friend has heard was incorrect. According to our knowledge, Qādyānis leader (Mirza Gulām Ahmad Qādyāni) died in a toilet.\n\n \n\nI have not read this story in any authentic book. However, if you could provide the source of this story, we may reply you accordingly.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum  \n\n \n\nMl.
