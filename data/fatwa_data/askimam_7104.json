  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have heared people say that the Jihad in Chechnya an Palestine are land issues as they have started out as land Issues.2. Is it permissable for Chechens to attack Russia to make the people feel what they are going through ? 3. Please explain this ayat \"wa qaatilul mushrikeena khaaffatan kama yuQatillunakum Kaaffa\"\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The two Jihaads are legitimate Jihaads.\n\n2. The Mujahideen of Chechnya have proven that their aim is to establish Islam, not simply to acquire land. In Palestine, there are many groups. Those fighting to establish Islam are undertaking a correct Shar?ee Jihaad. Those who do not have Islam as their aim are Munafiqeen. Their harm to Islam is even greater than that of Israel.\n\n3. The Aayaat means that when the Kuffaar are hostile to you than fight them completely, just as they fight your completely. You should not hold back anything and put all your resources behind the Jihaad.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
