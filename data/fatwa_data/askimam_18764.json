  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have simple question I was wondering do you have to be in wudu to read the sahih al bukari\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIt is not a pre-requisite to read the Sahīh Al Bukhari in a state of wudhu as opposed to the Holy Qur’ān. However, our Ulema emphasise the importance for one to be in a state of wudhu when reading/handling any Islāmic literature. This is done signifying its importance and portraying the highest amount of respect for Deen. Infact, it is a great act of virtue that one be in a state of wudhu all the time.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\nMl. Ebrahim Desai,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
