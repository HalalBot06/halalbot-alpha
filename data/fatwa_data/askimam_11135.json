  "question": "Time and Circumstance of the applicability of the hadith on the attributes sought in a perspective marriage partner.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nLiving in the west, it is impossibly to avoid looking at pretty women or their pictures even for a second as those are everywhere (schools, malls, media, even on computer pop-up ads). Islam on the other hand commands choosing a pious woman over the other three attributes that a woman may possess. Would that criteria apply in such a situation as well or there can be some flexibility in it for a man in choosing a women with a ltttle more emphasis on looks than on deen? What would be the punishment for doing so?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is no prohibition in the Shari?ah in getting married to a pretty or beautiful woman.\n\nHowever, Shari?ah emphasises on the quality of piety in a wife. One may therefore choose a woman with both qualities ? beauty and piety. Piety will increase and contribute towards fulfilling the aims and objectives of a successful and prosperous marriage. Beauty fades away over a period of time.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
