  "question": "As a sister,how do I make my Hindu family Muslim when they are anti-Islam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a new Muslim and have been Muslim for 8 months. My family are Hindu and as a result of my conversion and my marriage have renounced their love and support for me. My husband had converted me and has been largely responsible for keeping me within the folds of Islam, instilling in me fear for and love of Allah.I miss my family very much and am having a great deal of trouble coming to terms with the fact that we will never truly be together unless Allah(SWT)makes them muslim.They say they cannot allow me to practice Islam.I sometimes sink into depression and my Eman suffers. This is a reflection of my weakness. I love Islam. I love Allah and I love Muhammad(SAW) but I am affected by ties of the womb. When I look around me and see Muslims blessed with family , I yearn for my mother?s love. I have been observing niqab for close to 3 months now, at my husband?s request. Depending on the company of the people I am with, the niqab is an issue. I read your evidences for niqab online. It?s not the evidences that I need but the conviction and an eman-boost.I know I should be grateful that Allah (SWT) is testing me as our Lord only tests the slaves whom he loves. Sometimes, unfortunately, due to my own weaknesses, I fail to see this. Please help in dealing with what I should do about my family, how I should deal with this issue of niqab both internally and externally?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMay Almighty Allah Ta'ala grant you strength in your Imaan, Ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou are fortunate indeed to have been placed in a situation similar to the%0D%0ASahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum). They followed their consciousness and despite%0D%0Aall odds, the greatest being family pressure, they sacrificed and preserved%0D%0Atheir faith. It was due to their great sacrifices that Allah Ta'ala has%0D%0Apromised them great and lofty rewards in this world and the hereafter.%0D%0A%0D%0AAfter having understood the truth, imagine living with falsehood. The uneasy%0D%0Afeeling of grief and agony is a great punishment itself. Be thankful to%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala for having removed you from being trapped between truth and%0D%0Afalsehood. What is the benefit of the mother's love whilst being uneasy%0D%0Ainternally? Furthermore, the reward for sacrificing the mother's love, etc.%0D%0Adue to Islam is beyond our comprehension. It can only be understood after%0D%0Aexperiencing the bounties of Allah Ta'ala in Jannah. The life in this world%0D%0Ais temporary, the difficulties are also temporary. Patience and tolerance%0D%0Awill be of eternal revenue, Insha Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
