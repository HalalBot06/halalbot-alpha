Please advise if this is fine from an Islamic point of view.\n\nAsian Marriage Bureau\n\nThis bureau started in 1997. All enrolmemts are screened and investigated, so no chancers may join, the fees are used for admin costs, and advertising costs, the bulk goes to advertising costs. Memberships are cancelled if any one misuses the services, with the wrong intentions plus a fine\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYou may advertise with the following statement.\n\nIn principle, one may assist unmarried people to get married. Such assistance is offered by the Marriage Bureau. However, in doing so, there should be no un-Islamic acts perpetrated through such assistance. If there is anything un-Islamic committed through such assistance, then that assistance will not be an act of virtue. It will be vice and evil.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
