  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nmy question is weather pictures are haram in islam\ni know drawing eyes is haram but if i use a camera and took pictures with that be considered as haram\nplease can you varifiy weather i am allowed to take pictures or not\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nDuring the time of the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم there existed various ways of producing a picture; e.g. carving, painting, tracing, drawing, etc. The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم prohibited all these different types of pictures. In other words, the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم declared that pictures are prohibited and not the means of taking the photo. The ruling of picture-making does not change by the changing of the tool with which the picture is produced.\n\nThe invention of a camera merely marks yet another method of taking a photo. In order to understand this further it is essential that you understand the definition of a photograph.\n\nThe Oxford Dictionary defines the term ‘photograph’ thus, “a picture taken by means of the chemical action of light on a sensitive film.”\n\nThe American heritage dictionary has defined it as “An image, especially a positive print, recorded by a camera and reproduced on a photosensitive surface.”\n\nThe Websters revised unabridged dictionary, “A picture or likeness obtained by photography.”\n\nThese citations prove that a photograph is a picture (and not a mere reflection). Therefore, they will fall in the ambit of the explicit prohibition which is found in numerous authentic Ahadith.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
