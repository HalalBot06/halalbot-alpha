  "question": "What does one need to do if one gets a job as a customer service representative? Is it alright to speak with female customers with courtesy and politeness?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAlso, there are many education majors like Public Relations that require to be a little outspoken and a good talker whether to males or females. This then raises the question of shaking hands with female clients and other female officials. If one likes meeting people and talking to them, what does one have to do ? - What can be a logical (or a psychological) explanation (besides Quran and Hadith as it can only be true to a muslim) for music being haram in Islam as I get this question from many of my non-muslim friends. Is it alright to be friends with non-muslims ? 4. A friend of mine committed zina and then repented it. The girl also asked for Allah's forgiveness and they are now planning to get married. Would this be alirght ? What else do they need to do for Allah's forgiveness ? - I have a problem with focussing. I cannot focus for some reason and keep getting off the track whether it comes to my education, salat, or anything important. This also makes me lazy which has caused me great harm. What do I do ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) According to Shariah it is Haram (prohibited) for a person to have any communication with a ghair mahram (one permitted to marry) of the opposite gender. The implications of having contact with a strange person of the opposite gender are serious. Nabi (Salla Allahu alayhi wa%0D%0Asalam) is reported to have said, \"No two strangers seclude themselves that the third is shaytan.\" Shaytan is our enemy and his work is to mislead people. Allah Ta'ala has created us weak and we are attracted to temptations. It should not be that shaytan leads us through this contact to a more serious sin. Therefore, you should immediately start looking for an alternate job where you will not be required to communicate with strange women.%0D%0A2) The command of Allah will take precedence over everything. It is impossible for one to sacrifice the command of Allah for his%2Fher job. Being outspoken and a good talker in no way make talking to strange women permissible. However, if you are forced to communicate with strange women consider the following points.1)fear Allah 2)restrict your conversation to the need 3)only necessary talk of work should be discussed 4)try to lower your gaze while speaking 5)no loose conversation should take place. It is prohibited to shake hands with strange women.%0D%0A3) Allah Ta'ala created us and He knows what is harmful and beneficial for the human being. Accordingly He revealed laws and commands. Allah is Al-Hakeem, All Wise. Therefore the wisdom that is hidden in His command cannot be comprehended by our limited understanding. Besides music being expressly prohibited in the Quran and Hadith, present-day psychologists have also concluded that certain music tracks are harmful and affect the human mind. Statistics have proven that the message that is given in the song 5 out of 10 listeners carry it out. You might be aware of the song in which one of the singers says kill your father, kill your mother, satan is your lord. We have been informed through reliable sources that some listeners to this cassette have actually killed their parents. For this reason in some places or countries certain music cassettes are banned as that was having adverse effects on its citizens.%0D%0A4) It is permissible for your friend to marry the girl that he committed zina with. However, he should constantly seek forgiveness and fear Allah. He should also make a firm determination not to repeat the sin. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AFor-Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AChecked and approved: Moulana Emraan Vawda"
