  "question": "regarding movie on the computer are they the same as on the TV??",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Mufti Sahib, Is it permissible to watch cartoons and play games on the computer. Most Ulema say that pictures on the computer are not prohibitted, after hearing this many people who used to abstain from wathing TV have started watching cartoons on the computer as if it were no sin, please elaborate so that we may be saved from this fitnah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe factor which prohibits cartoons, movies and games on computer is not pictures in this case. Instead it falls under the category of Lahw and La?ib (useless forms of amusement).\n\nThere is no doubt that these cartoons and games is an absolute waste of time and energy and there is no benefit. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?It is from the excellence of a man?s Islam that he leaves what does not concern him.? (Tirmidhi). In another Hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) says, ?The involvement of a person in useless and futile issues and talks is a sign of Allah?s anger on him.? (Rabbaani)\n\nMay Allah Ta?ala save us from all Fitnahs, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
