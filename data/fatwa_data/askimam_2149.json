  "question": "I would like to know what are the limitations between a brother and a sister. In other words, what degree of frankness should they share?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThank you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe family is an integral part of an Islamic society and is an anchor for%0D%0Athe rest of one's life. As a wolf devours a lone sheep, so does Shaytaan%0D%0Aseize the one who does not keep family ties. 'He is the one who created man%0D%0Afrom water and gave him ties by lineage and marriage.' (Qur'aan).%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah has created the bond of love and affection between family members in%0D%0Aorder to ease the worldly life with regards to the obedience of Allah, i.e.%0D%0Awhen one experiences a problem which might affect his obedience to the%0D%0Adivine command, his family members are there to assist him through that%0D%0Adifficulty.%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore, there should be no formalities or reservations among family%0D%0Amembers. Each should feel free to discuss any problem with another at all%0D%0Atimes. However, the time we live in is not one of sanity and sobriety. Due%0D%0Ato all kinds of depravity warming their way into even in pious societies,%0D%0Acaution has to be exercised. Care should be taken that behaviour and%0D%0Ainteraction of family members with one another are always in keeping with%0D%0Amodesty. Discussions and involvement with anything of obscene nature should%0D%0Abe avoided as far as possible as this breaks down the natural barriers that%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala has kept between family members. A constant effort should be%0D%0Amade to bring Deen (religious fervour) into the home, thus, making for a%0D%0Ahappy family.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
