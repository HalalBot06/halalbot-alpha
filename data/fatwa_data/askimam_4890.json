  "question": "Pls, help with these dreams that I had sometime ago.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDREAM 1) What is the meaning of tafseer? i wanted to know what I should do{work/study} in this world. Read namaaz and slept. In this dream, the quran was opened and I was writing the word 'tafseer' on a book. Someone called me and i said im busy. DREAM 2...sometime before or after the 1st dream) There was a huge round light {was not blinding nor giving of heat} below that a little back were quawwli singers. In front of that , i was sitting with other men in a house{could be a musjid from the carpets} listening to them. There was also a dislodged door that I may of been sitting on. Is this dream for real or my mind playing tricks on me. Jazakallah Khair, may Allah reward you abundantly.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Tafseer is the commentary of the Qur'aan-e-Kareem. You should obtain a\nreliable commentary of the Qur'aan and study it. We suggest you offer an\nEnglish version of the Qur'aan. We recommend the following English\ntranslations: Muhammad Pickthall (Translation); Muhsin Khan (Translation);\nTafseer-e-Usmani (with commentary); Daryabadi (with commentary); Maariful\nQurãn (with commentary). NB. Any translation of the Noble Qurãn must be\naccompanied with the Arabic text next to the translation.\n2. May Allah Ta'ala grant us the strength to place good deeds in front of us\nand keep evil behind us, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
