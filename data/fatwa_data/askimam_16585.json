  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nRegarding the question under Futwa No. 16539 , the questioner seems to suffer from either BPH (Benign Prostate Hyperplasia) or other related one called Bladder Neck. I too am suffering from the same and found your answer too short to explain. I have been advised by the Doctor to urinate frequently otherwise the accomulated urine will cause kidney stones. So during the duty hours , i feel some drops of urine dribbling and sometimes if i perform ablution immediately before salah, i can feel some drops oozing out even in Sajdah. So i need to know in this condition what we have to do as per Shariah ruling as during the duty hours it is difficult to repeat the Wudhu.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nWhen you relieve yourself, you should conduct Istibraa, that is ensure all the urine comes out in some way or the other, for example coughing etc. It is also advisable to sprinkle water on the undergarment to avoid suspicion of urine drops. If one is certain of experiencing urine drops, then he may make use of a tissue to absorb the urine and discard the tissue and thereafter repeat the wuzu.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
