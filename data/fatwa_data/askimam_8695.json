The Qur?aan is perhaps the only book in human history that has such an outstanding tradition of oral transmission which can be traced back to the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) himself. While in the past memorisation of the Qur?aan used to be the basis of all Muslim education, today there is less emphasis on it due to changes in the educational system of the Muslims.%0D%0A%0D%0ABenefits of Memorisation of the Qur?aan%0D%0A1. Hadhrat Abdullah ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?He in whose heart there is no part of the Qur?aan is like a deserted house.?%0D%0A2. Uthmaan (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?The most superior amongst you is he who learns the Qur?aan and teaches it.?%0D%0A3. ?Verily, Allah Ta?ala has a family amongst man.? The Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) asked, ?Who are they, O Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).? Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) answered, ?The people of the Qur?aan are the family of Allah and his special servants.? (Ibn Majah)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another narration, it is mentioned that he who learns the Qur?aan and practices upon it, on the day of Qiyaamat his parents would be made to wear a crown which will outshine the sun, if the son had to be in our homes of this Dunya. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) then asked that what is your thought concerning the learner himself..? (Abu Dawud)%0D%0A%0D%0AThere are many more Ahaadith regarding the benefits of the memorisation of the Qur?aan which can be extracted from the books of Hadith. However, I would like to mention a few logical reasons and benefits of memorisation.%0D%0A1. Memorisation was the Sunnah of the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and was also observed by the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum), Taabi?een and all pious Muslims.%0D%0A2. Recitation of passages from memory is required for the correct performance of Salaat.%0D%0A3. Passages memorised are useful in practical Da?awah work.%0D%0A4. Memorisation and repetition of the Qur?aan leads to more rememberance and awareness of Allah and His message.%0D%0A5. Memorisation of the Ahkaam passages leads to more consciousness and determination.%0D%0A6. Memorisation leads to a deeper understanding and deeper faith in the message of the Qur?aan.%0D%0A%0D%0AAlthough many Muslims, known as Huffaaz, have memorised the complete Qur?aan, but it is an obligation upon every Muslim (young or old) to memorise as much of the Qur?aan, he is capable of doing.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Age to Start Teaching one?s Child the Qur?aan%0D%0AIn Tafseer-e-Mazhari, a riwaayat is mentioned on the authority of Hadhrat Anas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that amongst the Banu Abdul-Muttalib, when any child used to begin speaking, they used to teach him the last verses of Surah Bani Israaeel. From this, we learn that the Qur?aan should be taught as soon as the child is able to speak.%0D%0A%0D%0APunishment for Neglecting and Forgetting the Qur?aan%0D%0ABecoming a Hafiz is taking on a big responsibility of looking after the Qur?aan. Neglecting recitation of the Qur?aan will lead to earning the wrath and anger of Allah Ta?ala for which we will be punished severely.%0D%0A%0D%0AA famous riwaayat mentioned in Mishkaat of two angels taking Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) on a journey and showing him different incidents. Thereafter, revealing their interpretations. One of the incidents was of a person who was lying on the ground and another picking up a boulder and crushing the head of the person lying on the ground, after which the boulder rolled away. By the time the man goes to pick up the boulder and returns, the crushed person head returns to its original state and he repeats this action and punishment. Allah Ta?ala prescribed this punishment for such a person who was neglectful of reciting the Qur?aan.%0D%0A%0D%0AAlthough the punishment for neglecting and forgetting the Qur?aan is so severe, this does not mean that one should stay away from acts of worship due to its punishments. As Muslims and parents, our responsibility is to educate, teach and propagate Islam. Whether the recipient practices upon it or not, our responsibility is to propagate and their responsibility is to learn and practice upon it.%0D%0A%0D%0AThere is no doubt that the best gift a parent can give his child is the knowledge of the Qur?aan.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Sa?ad ibn Ubaadah (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has mentioned, ?There is not a man who learns the Qur?aan and forgets it, but he will meet Allah without any good.? (Abu Dawud)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Anas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) had mentioned that the rewards of the actions of my Ummah are presented to me, even the reward of that person who removes any dirt from the Masjid. Thereafter, the sins of my Ummah were presented to me. I did not see any sin greater than that of a person who had been given a Surah or Aayat of the Qur?aan, then he forgets it.? (Abu Dawood; Tirmidhi)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AQari Ismail Abdul-Azizi%0D%0AFACULTY OF THE QUR?AANIC SCIENCES%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
