  "question": "Is it haram to go to mixed reunions?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a 12-year-old girl and I am invited to my old school?s reunion. This is mixed, boys and girls. It is at an ice rink to go ice-skating, it is going to be public, not just the people from my old school. If I just stay with girls and avoid the boys can I go, because I just want to go for the benefit of the fun. I have no intension to hang around with the boys, only my girl ? friends. Can I go, if not why?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In the details of your query, you state, that the old schools reunion will be a mixed gathering of boys and girls. Allah Ta?ala says in the Qur?aan, ?Say (O Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)) to the believing men and women that Lower your gazes and protect your chastity. That is more pure for them.? By going to places where there is intermingling of sexes, for no need or necessity will not be permissible even though you may only intend to be with your girlfriends. What prevents the guys from approaching you?%0D%0A%0D%0A2. You also state you want to go for the benefit of the fan. Ice-skating involves a lot of moving around. It is not as if you and your friends can seclude yourselves in one place away from the guys. Whilst skating you are most likely to bump and brush against guys and this is also not permissible. Furthermore, many people performing in an audience do so to impress their spectators ? in the enquired case, the guys will do so for the girls who may be impressed with the performance and bravery of someone.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
