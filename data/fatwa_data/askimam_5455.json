  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalmuAlikum W W B i am going to marry with my AuntiesDaughter(Mother's sister).Due some reasons i am living in my aunties house where my fiancee is also there.Tell me is it permissible to live in a same house with fiancee.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible to have any premarital relationship whatsoever. It is\nalso not healthy for you to live in your aunt's house if the laws of Hijaab\nare not strictly adhered to. It is possible that the free environment in the\nhouse may lead you to communication with your future wife.\n\nThere may be no limit for any progressive relationship thereafter.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
