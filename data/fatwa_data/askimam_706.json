  "question": "Are women allowed to wear pants in Islam? Are women allowed to go to university so that they can become lady doctors?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI want to know if it is permitted for women to wear pants in Islam or if is it considered imitating men.I also wanted to know if it is permitted for women to do work outside because nowadays many situations are coming where it is necessary for the women to work to support their family.Jazak-Allah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) cursed a male who imitates a female and a female who imitates a man. (Mishkaat) Therefore, if a particular clothing is designed for males only and is generally worn by males, then it is not permissible for a female to wear such clothing as she will be imitating a male by her dressing which is prohibited. Shari'ah permits a female to work and earn an income without placing her Imaan and Islamic values at risk. The environment at college and universities is un-Islamic and filled with many immorals that is even evident by obtaining statistics of females having illicit relationships at colleges and universities resulting in many more evils, fornication, rape, abortion, etc. Therefore, in view of the possible need to work in future and preserving one's feminine and Islamic values, a female may consider private tuition in computers and home industry. and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
