  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is the basic concept of marriage, what age is preferable for that, what is the hoqooq (rights) of couple to each other, In Pakistan we live in joint family system how can a person manage his parents & his life partner & how can he balance his parents & bride rights? What is the basic concept of marriage, what age is preferable for that, what is the hoqooq (rights) of couple to each other, In Pakistan we live in joint family system ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The concept of marriage from an Islamic perspective is to attain solace and peace. Allah Ta?ala states, ?And from among His signs is that He created spouses from you and He created between you love and compassion.? (Surah Room) It is clear from the Aayat that the object of Nikah is to attain peace and tranquillity.\n\n2. The huqooq (rights) of the spouses are many. Nikah is a mutual institution. Rather than receiving one?s haqq, one should ensure his/her partner is happy and content. If the spouses start demanding their respective rights, this will harbour enmity and hatred between the spouses.\n\n3. We are unaware of the ?joint family system?, kindly explain.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
