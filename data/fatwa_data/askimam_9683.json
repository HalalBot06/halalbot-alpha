  "question": "Halaal or haram! companies have legal right to change the ingredients at any time without prior notice, in present circumstances they are misinforming about the use of pork and alcohol products",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe are totally confused about halal and haram in USA. In this country by law the food consumer companies have a legal right to change the ingredients at any time without prior notice and especially in the present circumstances they are misinforming about the use of pork and alcohol products. The day-to-day life has become very difficult. What shall we do? Shun everything! what precautions can we take, how do we become confidant that whatever is being said is authentic as lying, cheating, misinformation, fraud is rampant. Please advise us general rules and regulations of sharia that could keep us spiritually alive. We are noticing a general decline in our spirtual endeavors and we tend to go towards evil.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe are inundated with queries of Halaal and Haram of many products from different placesof America.\n\nWe are not in a position to issue Shar?ee decrees with certainty on products in America as we rely on information and not personal inspections. That can be best fulfilled by the local Ulama. It is our humble advise that Muslims in America establish reliable Halaal certifying organisation which must be headed by competent and reliable Ulama. These organisations must not be commercially motivated. Their aim should be to serve the Muslim community.\n\nAlhamdulillah, such organisations are highly successful in South Africa and offering guidance to the Muslim community on Halaal and Haraam. We will assist interested communities in America to establish such organisations to the best of our ability.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
