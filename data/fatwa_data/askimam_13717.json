She says that one day, she happened to masturbate, i told her its a sin and she said tauba, but she asked me a question regarding the masturbation, and i didnt know the answer so i am asking you, she said that after she masturbated, she reach an orgasm but there was no fluid at all, she was completely dry, she said she will wait for 15 mins to half an hour to check if there is any fluid but even then she was dry, not single a drop, she wants to know if she has to take Ghusul or will she be considered clean? Jazakallah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. There are negative aspects in making use of matrimonial sites.\n\n2. Masturbation is Haraam (strictly prohibited) and a major sin. If there was no emission of fluid after masturbating, then the Ghusl will remain valid. There is no need to make Ghusl again. However, the person must make Tawbah and sincerely repent for the sin of masturbation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
