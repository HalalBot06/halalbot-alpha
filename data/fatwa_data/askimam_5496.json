  "question": "Is using satellite signals and not paying for them forbidden?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI realize that watching TV is not encouraged but my question is that if I watch TV and purchase a satellite and don't pay for the service required to use the satellite (I get the signal without paying for it), is it haram? The cable company does not provide good channels via the cable system so we are using the satellite dish. Please advise.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTV in the first place is Haraam. This evil is compounded buy the illegal use of a service. In principle, it is not permissible to make use of a service unless the provider of the service authorizes its use.
