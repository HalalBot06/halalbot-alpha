  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSalam, I want to know what will be the duration of Iddat after khula? As i was not living with my  husband or past 6 months coz he was in abroad before he came i had given my case 2 the court 4 khula and had left that home and living somewhere else the process of khula will take about 3 months. Kindly satisfy me with refrence to hadith and Quran. Thanks. \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nThe duration of Iddat for Khula is the same as for Talaq (Divorce), 3 menstrual cycles. Rasulullah (sallallaho alayhi wasallam) has stated: Khula is a Talaq Baain (Irrevocable Divorce regarding its effect on the marriage and its laws of Iddat etc). HIDAYAH Pg 404/2.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl. Muhammad ibn Hashim Amod\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
