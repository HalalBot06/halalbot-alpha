  "question": "Can I move forward during salat? Sajdah Sahw; My mother wants me to marry my cousin but I do not really want to.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear respected mufti sahib, (i)Whilst leading salat with one person in uni, another joined in making the number three. At first, there were two and I as the imam was slightly ahead. When the third joined in, I stepped ahead thus two behind me. Was this correct? (ii) i have seen a few people in the masjid making one sajda after du'a. is there any basis for this? (iii)my mother wants me to marry my cousin but i do not really want to. Do I still have to make Istikharra about something which I do not want to do? Walaikum salam Mufti saheb. May Almighty Allah reward you for your efforts\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In such a situation, it is better for the Muqtadi (follower) to step\nback. However, if the Imaam stepped forward, there is no problem. (Fathul\nQadeer vol.1 pg.309; Rashidiyya)There is no basis for performing a Sajdah on\nits own as an Ibaadat. However, it is possible that these persons were\ndischarging their Sajda-e-Tilaawat (Sajda that becomes necessary by\nrecitation of an Aayat of Sajdah) at this time out of convenience in which\ncase there is no harm.\n2. If you have decided on the matter, then there is no purpose in making\nIstikhaara. If you are still unsure, it will be very beneficial to make\nIstikhaara.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
