  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe father-in-law is a Mahram (prohibited in marriage) to his\ndaughter-in-law.\n\nIn principle, she does not have to observe Hijaab (Purdah) between her and\nher father-in-law. However, if they both are young, they should display\nmodesty between them especially in these times of corruption and immorality\nwhen incest, rape, etc. are common.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
