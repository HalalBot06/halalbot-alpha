  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs salaam alaikum mufti saheb, What is the correct way to pronounce Divorce?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nDivorce should not be given while the woman is menstruating. It should preferably be in writing and witnessed by 2 witnesses.\n\nIt will be the husband's duty then to maintain her within the Iddat period. He should confer to her a set of clothes upon divorcing her. Rasulullah Â (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has stated, 'The most detested permitted act (by Allah) is divorce.' Hence, divorce should be made the last resort in solving one's dispute.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad Hashim Amod\n\nChecked and Approved by,\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
