  "question": "Regarding Shaykh Nazim al Qubrusi, Shakyh Kabbaani and followers, in reference to \"The Irrefutable Proof that Nazim al-Qubrusi Negates Islam\" by Shaykh Samir Kadi.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMufti Sahib, this is regarding shaykh Naazim. ?The Irrefutable Proof that Nazim al-Qubrusi Negates Islam? by Shaykh Samir Kadi. The link for this is http://www.aicp.org/IslamicInformation/Qubrusi/Nazimal-QubrusiNegatesIslam.htm. Last time it was Dr Palazzi but you mentioned he is no authority in Islam. Could we take Shaykh Samir Kadi (Ash'ariyy in Creed, Shafi'iyy in Madhhab, Rifa'iyy in Tariqah.) As authority? Can we take his judgement as valid upon evidence that he has given and atleast say he is deviant under the grounds laid by shaykh Samir Kadi. Reason for my asking is because there are a lot of muslims who take him as authority in england. So if the ruling by shaykh samir kadir is true and that shaykh nazim negates islam then what about his followers? misguided or they to negate islam? JazakAllah khairan for your reply wslm.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhile we appreciate your concern, it is necessary to understand an important%0D%0Aprinciple before addressing the issue at hand.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Fuqaha are unanimous that one may not declare a person a kaafir until%0D%0Athere is absolute proof to this effect. They have mentioned this principle%0D%0Athat should a person make a statement that is apparently a statement of%0D%0Akufr, and the statement has a hundred possible interpretations, of which 99%0D%0Ahave a clear meaning of kufr, and only one interpretation does not imply%0D%0Akufr, then the person should be given the benefit of the doubt. Hence it%0D%0Awill not be permissible to declare such a person a kaafir.%0D%0A%0D%0ABased on such principles, we say that we must be cautious before declaring%0D%0AQubrisi or Kabbaani as misguided.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn such matters each Aalim is expected to investigate the matter%0D%0Aindependently. It will not suffice to say that Shaykh so and so has%0D%0Ainvestigated the matter and has given a ruling.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf Kabbaani and Qubrisi are in fact deviant, then we will not hesitate in%0D%0Amaking this public. It is our Islamic duty as Ulama to expose all the false%0D%0Asects, in order to save the Imaan of the Muslim public.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, based on the principles set out by the Fuqaha, we find that there%0D%0Aare many issues still outstanding, hence no statement can be made at%0D%0Apresent. Some of these issues are:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. We have not had the opportunity to study the works of Qubrisi directly.%0D%0AWe only have on hand the statements quoted by Shaykh Kadi.%0D%0A2. Is Qubrisi alive? If so he should be given the opportunity to respond and%0D%0Aexplain his statements. Similarly, Kabbaani should also be given such an%0D%0Aopportunity.%0D%0A3. Having gone through some of the statements mentioned by Shaykh Kadi, we%0D%0Afind that he is definitely short sighted and hasty in his conclusions. The%0D%0Amajority of the statements can be quite easily interpreted in a manner in%0D%0Awhich it conforms to the Shariah.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is well known that the men of Tasawwuf have at times made such%0D%0Astatements, which externally convey a meaning that is apparently contrary to%0D%0Athe Shariah. However, the Ulama of Tasawwuf have explained the true intended%0D%0Ameanings of these statements, and have shown that these utterances do not%0D%0Aconstitute blasphemy. By way of example, it is famous that a group of%0D%0Aprominent Ulama branded Shaikh Ibn Arabi a heretic. Not withstanding the%0D%0Aprominence of these Ulama, the Ulama cum Sufis (those Ulama who are experts%0D%0Aat both the external branches of Ilm as well as Tasawwuf) have defended him.%0D%0AIn our opinion, most of the statements quoted in the said article of Shaykh%0D%0AKadi are of this nature.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn brief, we do not have sufficient grounds at present to declare that%0D%0AQubrisi is deviant.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf you have any other information on hand, you may forward it to us.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A"
