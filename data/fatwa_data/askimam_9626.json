  "question": "If some Qadiani says that he has embraced Islam and is no more Qadiani, how should it be verified.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nUsually Qadianis are liers and always pose to be muslims, therefore it cant be simply believed on his just saying that he has become muslim. On the other hand if some Qadiani has really become muslim, then he should be treated like a muslim brother. And if he is not treated like a muslim brother that is also injustice.Therefore some way of verification must have been found out by the Ullema Kiram.I really need help in this regard.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf a Qadiani claims to be a Muslim, then you should ask him about his beliefs regarding Mirza Ghulaam Ahmed Qadiani.\n\nIf he does not accept him as a prophet, Mahdi or a reformer and he also believes that Rasoolullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is the seal of prophethood, then you should accept him to be a Muslim. As you are residing in Pakistan, for further information and consultation, please refer to the Khatme Nubuwwat offices in your country.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf"
