  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy father in law drinks wine. Alot of it sometimes. He invites other Muslim friends over and they all drink together (Astaqfur?Allah). My husband, mother-on-law and I, are then forced to be in the same room with these people, and have dinner. We have forbade him to bring it in the house as we don't want our Salah to be invalid for 40 days. I have recently caught him hiding the wine in his room and drinking it secretly there, Astaqfar?Allah. And when his friends come over, we ask for no drinking, yet my father-in-law still serves it to them! How can we stop him, as the mention of Deen and Islam has not, and how does this affect our salah and du'a? Have they been accepted or would we have to make qaza? Please help...\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMay Allah Ta?ala assist you in your predicament, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0ADrinking wine is Haraam (expressly prohibited). Inviting others to wine is an added sin. It is also strictly prohibited for you and your mother-in-law to be in the company of your father-in-law?s friends as they are Ghayr Mahram (not prohibited in marriage). It is compulsory to maintain Hijaab with Ghayr Mahrams.%0D%0A%0D%0ASister, the family will have to attend to your father-in-law?s problems taking into consideration many things, including his nature and temperament. If being hard on him will be effective in reforming him, then that attitude may be adopted by all the family members as being soft on him will not be a deterrent. He will continue with his habit. It may well be that being hard may also have negative consequences. We advise the family members consult each other on the best course of action to repair the problem.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn brief, the matter must be attended to in the most effective way. Consulting with each other will contribute in coming up with an effective way. May Allah Ta?ala assist you and your family, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
