  "question": "2. What is the dalil to read 41x yasin to achieve our hajat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. I heard Yusuf Qardhawi divides ikhtilaf into 4 categories:1. Those which are condrative, e.g. the oneness of Allah, the prophethood of Nabi s.a.w. Anything contradictive to this is rejected. 2. Comparative, something is better than something else 3. Variative, in terms of ibadat mostly, 4. Complementative, differences which actually complement each other. What is your view? 2. What is the dalil to read 41x yasin to achieve our hajat? 3. Can we make aqiqah eventhough we are old already? What is the preferreed procedure regarding the meat etc?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The Fuqahaa have discussed many denominations of differences, some of which is stated in the details of your question in reference to Sheikh Yusuf Qardhawi.\n\n2. This practise is based on experience and positive results. There is nothing wrong in following such experiences.\n\n3. Aqeeqah is Mustahabb. If Aqeeqah was not done, then it is not necessary to make up for it. However, if one wishes to do Aqeeqah, then he may do so at 7 days interval, for example, if Aqeeqah was not done at 7 days, then he may do it at 14 days or 21 days, etc.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
