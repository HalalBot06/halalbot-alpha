Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said:\n\nإن مما أدرك الناس من كلام النبوة ، إذا لم تستحى فافعل ما شئت\n\n\"Indeed, surely people will come to know the words of prophethood. If you do not have shame, then do as you wish.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 4, P. 183, Dar Al-Fikr)\n\nالحياء من الإيمان والإيمان فى الجنة والبذاء من الجفاء والجفاء فى النار\n\n\"Modesty is from Iman, and Iman leads you to Paradise. Shamelessness is from futile things, and futile things lead you to the fire of Hell. (Sunan Al-Tirmidhi, Vol. 2, P. 21, HM Saeed)  \n\nOne should make sincere tawbah (repentance) and istighfar (seeking of forgiveness) and make a firm resolution that the act will never be committed again. Allah Ta'ala is the Most-Forgiving and surely accepts sincere repentance of His servants as is stated in the Holy Quran:\n\n  ومن يعمل سوءا أو يظلم نفسه ثم يستغفر الله يجد الله غفورا رحيما\n\n\"Whosoever commits a sin or wrongs himself and then seeks Allah’s forgiveness, he will surely find that Allah is most forgiving, most merciful.\" (4:110)\n\n2) There is no specific dua assigned in Shari'ah. However, according to the experience of our pious predecessors, a pregnant woman should read Surah-al-Maryam in its entirety daily during her pregnancy. This will keep the mother and child safe and healthy InshaAllah. Shari'ah does not prohibit from drawing from such experiences.\n\nFor a pious child, the following verse from the Holy Quran should be read:\n\nرب هب لي من لدنك ذرية طيبة إنك سميع الدعاء\n\n“O My Lord! Grant me from your side pleasant children for verily You are very attentive to the prayers (of everyone).\" (3:38)\n\nThis is the dua which the Prophet Zakariyya (Alayhis Salaam) made to Allah Ta'ala to grant him pious children.\n\nGeneral guidelines to help ensure a healthy pregnancy and birth include the following:\n\nPregnant women should eat a variety of foods (e.g., vegetables, fruits, grains) to ensure a sufficient supply of basic nutrients.\nThe diet should include low-fat dairy products and lean meat.\nIf a woman experiences nausea or morning sickness, or if she feels too full too soon in the later stages of pregnancy, it may be helpful to eat several small meals rather than a few large meals.\nPregnant women should limit their consumption of caffeine and excess salt.\nPregnant women should limit fish consumption to 2 servings per week and limit the intake of white or albacore tuna to no more than 6 ounces per week.\nAfter labor, a lactating woman should eat a lot of grapes as they are good for milk production.
