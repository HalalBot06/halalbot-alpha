  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a student at one of the world's best universities but I have been doing very bad in my studies(failing most of my exams). In our home studies come only second in priority to religion. My parents expect a lot from me as I am the eldest. But recently I have been experiencing a lack of concentration. I have been having mood swings due to which sometimes I feel so depressed that I feel like I can never complete my studies but some time later I manage to pull myself together and feel that Allah will definately help me(Mashallah I have been blessed in the sense that He has always heard my prayers whenever it has meant so mush to me). I do not want to disappoint my parents, specially my father. I do not have the guts to tell him that I am doing so terribly in my studies. Please help me as all of this is also affecting my deen. I feel as if I am losing it all. I do not want to become one of those who leave their religion. But I am very scared that I might be walking on that path to hell. I feel that Allah Ta'ala is punishing me for my sins (like lying, back biting, etc). After my prayers I half-heartedly make dua to Him and don't put any effort in it. This is a very big concern for me because making dua has always made me feel good but now that is gone too. Please suggest any wazeefa that would help me get back to my religion.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for writing to the institute. Please excuse the delay in responding to your mail.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou write about the difficulty you are having with your studies at the moment. Do you perhaps have other problems either financial or social, etc which are preventing you from concentrating on your studies? Could it be that you have taken on a course of study which is not really suited to your needs and thus you are having difficulty with your studies? It will be wise to approach your father in an honest way and tell him that you are finding difficulty in coping with your studies at the moment. If you do not tackle this problem now, you may find that as time goes by the pressure on you will increase as your parents will be expecting positive results from you. By not telling htem, you will go on experiencing guilt feelings for not being up-front with them. This will cause you further stress.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou are not a failure as a person if you do not achieve in your studies this year. Sometimes we just make the wrong choices or other factors interfere with one's goals. Do please examine all avenues and take a mature approach to this problem. Although your parents have high hopes, they are after all human and insha'allah they will understand that you are having difficulty. Let them guide and support you in whatever way they can. As you say, this pressure is leading to your stumbling in the your deeni activities too. Do try, however to be totally steadfast with your salaah, zikr, Quranic recitation, istigfaar and avoid those activities which bring on the displeasure of Allah Ta'ala. I enclose some duas for concentration and studying. Insha'allah these will be of some use to you too. May Allah Ta'ala grantyou success in your studies, ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A1SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0ADUAAS FOR STUDYING%0D%0A%0D%0A\"Allahumma infa'nii bimaa 'allamtanii wa'allimnii maa yanfa'uunii.
