  "question": "Should i clear the debt before going for Hajj?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni am working in saudi arabia, i had borrowed amount  by interest  and also my father had borrowed amount from others and i am repaying that  slowly . Can i perform hajj and clear the borrowed amount after hajj.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nInterest is haram. If the person who borrowed you the money is a Muslim, you should discuss the issue with him and explain him not to take the interest. You too are equally sinful as you agreed to pay interest. Paying interest is a big curse. You should try to clear the loan as soon as possible. If you have excess money, use that to pay out the loan instead of going for Hajj.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
