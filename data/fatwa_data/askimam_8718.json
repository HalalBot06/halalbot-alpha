  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am married to a converted muslim who use to follow Islam. But recently, he has come under the influence of his family (especially mom?s). He says he still believes, but I am afraid of him converting back. I am very worried because kids are involved in this marriage. Although the kids are going to Islamic school, I am afraid when they grow up, they'll see the father not being the best follower and they might rebel as well. Is there a dua i can read for him, so his Iman gets stronger and so he becomes A Better Muslim? Please pray for us, so Allah can guide all of us to the right path.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou should perform two Rak?aats Salaatul Haajat and make Du?aa for your husband i.e. that Allah Ta?ala keeps him steadfast on Imaan. You can recite the following Du?aas:%0D%0A%0D%0AAllahumma inni asalooka bi ?izzatika ya ?azeezu wa bi qudratika ya qadeeru wa bi hamdika ya hamidu wa bi hikmatika ya hakeemu wa bi rahmatika ya raheemu wa bi ?azmatika ya ?azeemu wa bi ?afwika ya ?afuwwu wa bi fadhlika ya rahmaanu wa bi mannika ya mannaanu an tahfaza ?alayyhil imaana fi aanaail laili wa atraafin nahaari qaaiman wa qaa?idan raaki?an wa saajidan yaqdhaanan wa naaiman hayyan wa mayyitan wa ?alaa kulli haalin ya arhamar rahimeen%0D%0A%0D%0ATranslation: ?O Allah, I ask you through your honour O Noble One and through your power O Most Powerful and through your praises O Most Praiseworthy and through your wisdom O the most Wise and through your mercy O most Merciful and through your greatness O Great One and through your forgiveness O most Forgiving and through your grace O most Gracious and through your bestowal O Benefactor that You keep him on Imaan during the day and the night, while standing, sitting, in Ruku, Sajdah and while awake and asleep, while alive and dead and during every other condition O most Merciful of the merciful ones.? (Fataawaa Rahimiyyah, Vol. 7, Page 108)%0D%0A%0D%0AYa muqallibal quloob thabbit qalbahu ?ala deenik%0D%0A%0D%0ATranslation: ?O Controller of the hearts let his heart hold fast onto your religion.?
