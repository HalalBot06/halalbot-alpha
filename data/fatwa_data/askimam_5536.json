  "question": "2. Can we proceed with our marriage even if the parents of this divorced woman especially the mother is against our plan ?(salam)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, an adult female may marry herself without the consent of her\nmother. If the Iddat is over, she may marry. It is not necessary for the\ndivorce papers to be finalized to marry.\n\nHowever, it is best in the interest of the matter to discuss the matter with\nthe mother and inform her of her daughter's intention to marry anyway. We\nsuggest you do not hasten in marrying the person. You should make Mashwara\nand Istikhaara if you are unsure, especially if you suspect her having\nrelationship with her ex-husband.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
