SIR PLEASE TELL ME IS IT RIGHT PATH OR CULT OR SHAYTAAN? I READ IN BOOKS \"SAHAABA KARAAM AND TAABAIEN , TABA TABAIEN WAS KASHFUL QABOOR. IS THAT RIGHT OR WRONG? PLEASE GUIDE ME. THANKS.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are two issues regarding your matter; a) Kashf, and b) Guidance\n\nAllah Ta’ala opens up the condition of some inmates of graves to some people. There is no specific rule to determine who has Kashf. It is based on the honesty and trustworthy of the person that claims to have kashf. Generally, the Awliyaa and the very pious have Kashf of the graves. One has to be very careful in accepting the claim of Kashf from just any person. Kashf of the graves is not a requirement of our beliefs. It is also not necessary to believe in the Kashf of the graves of anyone.\n\nAs regards guidance, Kashf is not a proof or basis in Shari’ah. The information through Kashf has no sanction in Shari’ah. Allah Ta’ala has made the Ulama a means of guidance. Why should one leave the guidance of the Ulama and resort to one’s own devised ways of guidance. The way of guidance of Allah is the only accepted way. Allah never instruct us to receive guidance through the Kashf of the graves. This attitude is dangerous and you should immediately distance yourself from such a person. There are many Ulama-e-Haqq. Refer to them and follow their advice. The positive feeling of guidance through Kashf is nothing but a deception of the Shaytaan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
