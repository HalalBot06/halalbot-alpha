  "question": "Q1. Correct way of reading “tashahud”. Q2. Women praying along in masjid. Q3. Dispute between relatives.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. I?m aware that in the prayers we should strictly stick by the word in every step. I?ve always read the ?salatul ibrahim? in tashahud saying in the end ?wa baarik ala mohammad wa ala aali mohammed kama baarakta ala ibrahim wa ala aali ibrahima innaka hameedun majeed? but I?ve been told that I should add in the end ?kama barakta ala ibrahim fil aalameen innaka hameedun majeed?. Please clarify is this a difference between hanafi and hanbali madhab? 2. Is it allowed for a women to join the jamaat prayer in the masjid if she is alone in the ladies section? 3. If 2 relatives or friends are upset with each other their good deeds don?t go up to be presented to the Almighty. Does this apply on both sides even if one of them is trying hard to settle things and end the dispute?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is correct to add \"\"kama barakta ala ibrahim wa ala aali ibraheema fil aalameen innaka hameedun majeed\".(Raddul Muhtar Vol. 1 Pg.512, Bahrur Raiq Vol.1 Pg.347, Al-Hujjah Pg.139) This is narrated in numerous ahadith. This is according to the Hanafi Mazhab. According to the Hambali Mazhab, Ibn Qudama mentions in Al-Mughni Vol.1 Pg.318, that it would be permissible to add this, however it would be preferred not to.\n\n2. Yes, however it is preferred for women to perform salah at home.\n\n3. It applies to the one who insists on breaking the ties, not to the one who is trying to mend them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
