  "answer": "QUESTION\nhe said that if man and women like each othere so he have right to sex because they dont gave any problem to other. so plz gave the answer .\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFirst and foremost, it must be understood that we are the slaves of Allah and we express submission to the orders of Allah without questioning the wisdom behind the orders of Allah. It is sufficient for us that Allah is al-Hakeem ? the All-Wise and every order of Allah is filled with wisdom. Our limited minds may not be able to comprehend the unlimited wisdom of Allah in His orders.%0D%0A%0D%0AIslam is a set of rules and we are not free to do as we like. If a person is free to do as he likes and that is the rationale to permit consensual sex, then that rationale should be applied all round. There should be no restriction in any way whatsoever to restrict any two people to do as they like. Consensual relationship should not be confined to before marriage. It should be extended beyond that. Two married couples should be permitted to have extra marital affairs and the spouse should not object to that as it is a man and woman liking one another. If one?s mother has consented to having affair, the son should not have the right to object.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf two parties of the same gender decide to marry one another, that should be granted. If some unclothed man or woman decide to parade in public, that too should be granted. It is what they and the republic like. The list goes on. Human nature and desire knows no bounds to fulfil their passion. It is this philosophy that has put the whole world into turmoil. The world is suffering the consequences of fulfilling all their passions and desires. There is grief and agony, disputes and displeasure all because people carry out whatever they like. If a boy and girl like each other and have consequential sex, apart from that being a violation of Divine Order, did we consider and evaluate the consequences and harms of the two individuals and the burden caused by the two to society.%0D%0A%0D%0AAre the swelling numbers of teen pregnancies and the burden on society not known to us? Are the swelling of teen abortions and the burden on society not known to us. How many young girls have submitted themselves to their lovers only to be used and dumped sooner or later. The world witnesses with such cases almost everyday. All this because two persons did what they liked! What about depression followed by suicidal cases. Shari?ah is a religion of peace and contentment. Anything that is against peace and contentment and leads to grief and agony is opposed to it. In restriction, there is safety and security to individuals and to the society as accomplishment of one?s desires does not go without burdening the society.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
