  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI got married about an year ago to a doctor with a 6 yrs old son from her previous husband. I also have 2 children living with my ex wife. I pay children support to my children. The son. my wife got from her previous marriage living with us. the sons father has very good job and earns good money but he pays only school expenses for the son. the son has lot other expenses like food residence care taker etc and my wife does not want to pay any of her son's expenses. I am a business man but last 2 yrs i don't have any business and I lost lots of money. Before I married her I told her I need time to recover my business than I will marry but because of her rush I had to marry her. I told her she should at least pay part of the food we buy every months. Can you please tell me in details what sharia says about the situation. Thanks Mohammed\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nSince your spouse’s son is living with you, it is only your moral obligation to provide for him. If you are not financially stable and his expenses are too much for you to take care of, your wife should ask her ex-husband (Tahif’s biological father) to provide additional funds to take care of his expenses. It is the duty of the biological father to maintain and to provide for his child.\n\n(Fatāwā Mahmudiyyah, Vol.13, Pg.466, Fārukiyyah)\n(Ad-Durrul Mukhtār, Vol.3, Pg.612, HM Saeed)\n(Fatāwa Hindiyyah, Vol.1, Pg.560, Rashidiyyah)\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n\nDārul Iftāa"
