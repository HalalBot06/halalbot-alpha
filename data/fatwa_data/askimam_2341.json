  "question": "Is it wrong to not accept my parents wish?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am the eldest female in my family and at the right age to to be married. However, my heart is in studying Islamic Law. Now is it wrong of me to turn down the purposals that my parents have been trying so hard for me to accept. My heart is not happy with that I wish to continue with my studies and only live praying to Allah (swt).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFrom the Shariah point you cannot be forced or coerced into a marriage or\naccepting a proposal. However one looks at the Hadith Nabi\nsallahualaihiwasalam said \" O youth if any of you have the means to marry he\nshould as it lowers the eyesight and protects the private parts. Also The\nProphet of Allah said \" If one whose Deen and character pleases you proposes\nyou should marry him if not there would be tribulations and great evil\".\nMarrying and pursuing your studies could be done simultaneously,as this has\nbeen and is been done by both men and women.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
