  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a married women and i am living with my husband's brother and his wife. but as a muslim women it is my right to have my own home without my husband's in - laws. Can you suggest me any dua'a so i could have my own home without my in-laws.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is definitely your husband?s responsibly to provide shelter for you, however you should note that he does not have to provide a separate house for you.\n\nWhat you are entitled to is a separate room, which can lock and the keys to which you hold. Yes, if you are from a very wealthy family and the norm is that the husband provides a separate house for his wife, then it would be his responsibility to provide a separate house for you.\n\nHowever, I am sure that if it was in your husbands means he would have long ago, acquired a home, thus instead of pressurizing him by constantly demanding a home, you should be patient and make dua to Allah to ease the conditions. Ensure that you observe strict pardah with your husband brother and other ghair mahrams.\n\nYou could read the following dua:Alaahumakhfirlee Zambee wawassi'lee fee daaree wabaariklee fee rizqee.\n\nMake Allah make it easy for you and quickly fulfil your needs\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Be"
