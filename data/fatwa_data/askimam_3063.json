The foremost%0D%0Aqualification of the bride is as the holy Qur'aan which is for all times%0D%0Asays, 'marry such women as seen good to you.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIt appears therefrom that the boy should exercise greatest caution and%0D%0Aconsideration. It is a mere misconception or wrong notion to feel that one%0D%0Acannot find the correct person in today's times. The following points should%0D%0Abe considered in making the correct choice:%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Nabi (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) as saying, \"A woman is married for four things, i.e. her%0D%0Awealth, her family status, her beauty and her religion. So you should marry%0D%0Athe religious woman (otherwise) you will be a loser.\" (Mishkaat)%0D%0A%0D%0ASo, try to get one who is religious and prosper. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) exhorts his followers to make religion piety the first criteria of%0D%0Achoice of woman. And there is no denying the fact that if a Muslim acquires%0D%0Apiety and abstinence, it is mostly due to a virtuous wife who in the words%0D%0Aof Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) again is the best of benefit of the%0D%0Aworld. Conclusively, it is clear that if there exist no piety then generally%0D%0Awealth, beauty and lineage had no worth. In addition, in a situation where%0D%0Athere exists no piety the chastity and modesty of a woman is in danger.%0D%0AChastity and modesty is after all the hallmark of a woman, therefore, the%0D%0Amost important thing to seek in a girl is piety.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe girl should be somewhat learned, she should have a sound knowledge of%0D%0ADeen. She should not be ignorant. Our advise is that a lot of Du'aa should%0D%0Abe made by virtue of which Allah will grant you the perfect partner.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
