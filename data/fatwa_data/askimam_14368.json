  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know why there are a specific number of times that sertain duas should be recited. Eg: why 33 soegaanalah,  33 algamduliela,   34 allahuakbar\n\nI know that our Nabie (PBOH) has said on many occasions that this is what and how many times it must be said. I\n\nwould just like to know the significance of the numbers.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere is no real significance to the numbers 33 and 34. One may make Tasbeeh for any number of times. However, in the Hadith 33, 33 and 34 could be mentioned to complete 100.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
