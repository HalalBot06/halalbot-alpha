  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a serious problem since last few years.Whenever i try to get regular in namaz or want to recite some prayers,i get unwanted bad thoughts about Allah.I know from heart i dont  want to think like that.But these kind of thoughts come repeatedly.And after that  i remain so much depressed and keep asking tauwbah from Allah.Could you tell me some dua to stop this problem and strengthening my imaan.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nGetting such thoughts is a sign of Imān. The Sahābah رضى الله عنهم would also suffer from such thoughts about Allah Ta‘ālā. In one narration it is mentioned that they approached Rasūlullah صلى الله عليه و سلم about these thoughts and said, “O Rasūlullah صلى الله عليه و سلم , we perceive in our hearts certain things (thoughts) which we deem to be too grave to discuss. We would not even love to have the entire world in exchange of discussing it.” Then Rasūlullah صلى الله عليه و سلم said, “Do you really perceive that?” They replied, “Yes.” Rasūlullah صلى الله عليه و سلم then said, “That is evident Imān.”\n\nIn another narration related by Ibn Abbās رضى الله عنه , it is stated that a man came to Rasūlullah صلى الله عليه و سلم and said, “O Rasūlullah, some of us perceive (certain things) in our hearts that it would be more beloved to become ashes than to discuss it.” Rasūlullah صلى الله عليه و سلم then said, “Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar; all praise belongs to that Being who has confined his (Shaytan’s) plot to mere whispers.”\n\n \n\nعن أبى هريرة قال جاءه ناس من أصحابه فقالوا يا رسول الله نجد فى أنفسنا الشىء نعظم أن نتكلم به أو الكلام به ما نحب أن لنا وأنا تكلمنا به. قال « أوقد وجدتموه ». قالوا نعم. قال « ذاك صريح الإيمان ». (سنن ابي داود ج 2 ص 341 ، سعيد)\n\n \n\nعن ابن عباس قال جاء رجل إلى النبى -صلى الله عليه وسلم- فقال يا رسول الله إن أحدنا يجد فى نفسه - يعرض بالشىء - لأن يكون حممة أحب إليه من أن يتكلم به فقال « الله أكبر الله أكبر الله أكبر الحمد لله الذى رد كيده إلى الوسوسة »  (سنن ابي داود ج 2 ص 341 ، سعيد)\n\nIt is the pastime of Shaytān to attempt distracting the obedient servants of Allah from worshipping and remembering Him. You should not worry about such thoughts and merely disregard them. The Shuyūkh of Tasawwuf generally equate such whispers and devilish insinuations to the barking of a dog. The best thing that a person should do in such a situation is to merely disregard the barking and carry on with one’s business. The more attention one pays to the senseless barking, the more incessantly the dog barks. After firmly grounding oneself in disregarding such thoughts and whispers, one will, insha Allah, find peace and tranquility in the heart and mind. Along with this, you should recite Ta‘awwudh (i.e. أعوذ بالله من الشيطان الرجيم ) abundantly.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Yusuf bin Yaqub,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nConcurred by:\n\nMl.
