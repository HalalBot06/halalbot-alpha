  "question": "Is \"Reliance of the Traveller\" a good resource? How does the Shafi'i madhab differ from other ones?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn question 2483 someone stated that the \"Reliance of the Traveller\" states gambling is lawful. I bought the book to give me answers on fiqh questions. I cannot find any reference to gambling as being anything other than haram.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Reliance of the Traveller is a translation of 'Umdat as-Salik by Ibn\nNaqib, a student of Imam Taqiyy ad-Din as-Subki. It presents the mu'tamad\nviews of the Shafi'i madhhab. It was translated by Shaykh Nuh Hamim Keller.\nThe translation is excellent, and the translator has added several\nappendices which enhance the value of the book.\n\nOn the whole, the book is an orthodox presentation of Shafi'i fiqh, while\nthe appendices might contain material that does not strictly fall under the\naegis of fiqh.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nShaykh Taha Karaan\nShaafi'ee Madhab - DARUL ULOOM AL-ARABIYYA AL-ISLAAMIYYA"
