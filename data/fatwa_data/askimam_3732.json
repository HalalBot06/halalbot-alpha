  "question": "My son wants to marry a Catholic girl. Does Islam allow a Muslim Man to marry a Catholic woman ? Under which conditions is it still permissible to marry the 'People of the Book' ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf my son goes ahead and marry's the Catholic girl, without my and his father's permission; should we still keep in touch with him. Is it permissible in Islam to break all contact with your child for taking a step like this without his/her parent's concent ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer below on marriage to the Ahlul Kitaab.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe advise you apply your discretion on determining whether it will be better%0D%0Ato break ties with your sons or not. If he is making an incorrect decision,%0D%0Aespecially, when his Imaan is at risk by marrying such a girl and he will%0D%0Asuccumb to the pressure of the parents, then the decision to break ties with%0D%0Ahim will be appropriate.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf he will not succumb to the pressure, then it will not be appropriate to%0D%0Abreak ties with him. Wisdom and diplomacy should be applied to communicate%0D%0Awith him. If he is insistent on getting married to such a girl, he should be%0D%0Aadvised to give her Da'wah to Islam and convert her.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is not permissible for a Muslim female to marry a non-Muslim male.%0D%0AHowever, a Muslim male may marry only a Christian or Jewish female. It is%0D%0Anot permissible for a Muslim male to marry any other non-Muslim female.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is obvious that there are many things a male can do, which is not easily%0D%0Apossible for a female and vice versa. Islam has taken into consideration the%0D%0Amasculine and feminine strength and weaknesses respectively. There is a%0D%0Apossibility of the non-Muslim male due to his masculine powers convincing%0D%0Ahis Muslim wife into abandoning Islam. Therefore, Islam has considered her%0D%0Afeminine nature and protected her correct beliefs by prohibiting her%0D%0Amarrying a non-Muslim.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Muslim husband is not obliged to pressurise his Christian%2FJewish wife to%0D%0Aaccept Islam. He may apply wisdom and diplomacy and only influence her to%0D%0AIslam.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn Islam, a female is equally respected as a male, however, due to the%0D%0Adifferent masculine and feminine natures, Islam believes in separation of%0D%0Aroles."
