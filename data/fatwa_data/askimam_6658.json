  "answer": "QUESTION\nI stay with my friend and a new muslim brother came to stay with us. Myself and my friend working in day shift and new muslim brother working at night and sleep in day. While we perform 'duha' prayer at home we asked him to wake up for duha salat. He was not happy since we disturbed him and he started telling about his suffers if he wake up in between he cannot work at night and so on... We tried this for first day only and after this incident we don't wake him up for prayer. Is it sin fall on us if we don't wake him up? How can we handle this situation? Please make dua for this brother.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou should be very careful in approaching the new Muslim. His lifestyle and\ndaily schedule before accepting Islam has been completely different. He has\nmade a great sacrifice in accepting Islam. When a person accepts Islam, he\nis bound to all the injunctions of Shari'ah. But naturally he also requires\ntime to adjust. Remember, his families may all be non-Muslims. You have to\nbecome his family. You should honour the new Muslim by showing him care and\naffection as much as possible.\n\nIn order for the non-Muslim to sacrifice his sleep and to perform his\nSalaat, we advise you apply wisdom and diplomacy and gradually explain him\nthe importance of Salaat. Once he understands the importance of Salaat and\nhis mind is made up, he will make the sacrifice. Remember, education and\nlove are the most efficient forces of change and reformation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
