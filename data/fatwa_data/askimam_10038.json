That can never change. Every individual will get married to the person decreed by Allah, not to anyone else. To believe otherwise is futile. We have to adopt means in this world a search for what Allah has decreed for us. If the search is unsuccessful, regard that as the decree of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is compulsory to be content with the decree of Allah. There is nothing wrong in sending a proposal again and requesting the girl to reconsider your proposal provided your dignity and honour is maintained. It does not behove an honourable person to sacrifice his honour. There is also no reason for you to be despondent if the girl rejects your proposal again. You should move on with your life. You cannot allow one person to take control over your life especially when she is not an active partner in your life. You must face reality and accept that girl is not decreed for you. Allah in his infinite wisdom knows better.%0D%0A%0D%0AOur limited understanding may not be able to comprehend the negative factors behind that. Make dua to Allah to grant you a marriage partner who is best for you according to the knowledge of Allah. When you come across the girl that is decreed for you, all will fall in place. InshAllah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
