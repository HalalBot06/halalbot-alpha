  "question": "When I die I would to donate my body organs (whichever organs that are useable) to whoever is in need. Can I do that?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOrgan Transplant%0D%0AMany Islamic scholars and Jurists have written on the subject of organ%0D%0Atransplant. Over the decades, medicine has improved and advanced%0D%0Adramatically, taking medical technology to extreme heights.%0D%0AToday, through the vast medical advancement, almost any transplant of the%0D%0Ahuman body can be performed. Owing to the technological medical changes,%0D%0Aprominent and renowned jurists of the world have carefully analysed the%0D%0Aprocess of organ transplant and upon investigation made the following%0D%0Aobservations:%0D%0A1. When any person's limb or organ becomes unusable and that limb or organ%0D%0Ais needed to function in the future by a suitable replacement then the%0D%0Afollowing conditions must be considered.%0D%0A%0D%0AUse of a non-living component.%0D%0A%0D%0AUse the limb of those animals permissible to eat and slaughtered according%0D%0Ato the Islamic rites of slaughter.%0D%0A%0D%0AThere is almost certain fear of loss of life or danger of losing the%0D%0Alimb%2Forgan and the replacement is only found in Haraam animals or in%0D%0Apermissible animals (which can be eaten) but not slaughtered according to%0D%0AIslamic rites, then use of such a component will be permissible. However, if%0D%0Athere is no imminent danger of loss of life then it will not be permissible%0D%0Ato use anything from the pig.%0D%0A2. Similarly, a transplant of any nature whatsoever is permissible from one%0D%0Apart to another part of the body of the same person when necessary.%0D%0A3. The sale of any part of the human body is Haraam.%0D%0A4. If any ill person reaches a stage that a specific organ becomes unusable%0D%0A(to such an extent) that if a human organ is not replaced into the body then%0D%0Athere is an immediate danger of loss of life -- the human organ is the only%0D%0Asuitable replacement and medical experts are absolutely certain that besides%0D%0Athe human organ, there is no other life-saving substitute and the patients'%0D%0Alife is in danger, and the human organ is easily available to the patient,%0D%0Athen in that dire need a human organ transplant (to save one's life) will be%0D%0Apermissible for the sick.%0D%0A5. When a perfectly healthy person on the advice of an expert physician%0D%0Aconfirms that the removal of one kidney will not harm nor cause ill-health%0D%0Awhatsoever and considering the deteriorating health of his sick immediate%0D%0Afamily member which may cause death and there is no other alternate or%0D%0Asubstitute then this will be permissible with the condition that the kidney%0D%0Abe donated and not sold.%0D%0AThe bequest (Wasiyyat) of a person that after his death, his organs be%0D%0Adonated is forbidden in Shariah.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0A"
