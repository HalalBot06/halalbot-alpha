  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nTIll when does the Fazar time lasts. Or to put it this way till when can I pray my Fazar namaz.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nوقت الفجر ما لم تطلع الشمس (صحيح مسلم)\n\nThe time of Fajr remains until the rising of the Sun. (Sahih Muslim)\n\nThe time of Fajr ends when the sun rises from the horizon.  You may perform your Fajr salah before this time.  It should not be mistaken with the sun rays that emit from the sun as the rays are not the actual sun itself.  It might be difficult to witness the actually sunrise due to many reasons, e.g. the horizon being cloudy, mountainous region, etc, therefore it is advised that one should follow the timetable prepared by the Muslims experts wherein the exact time of sunrise is stated.\n\nBadai al-Sanai\n\nAl-Hidaya\n\nNur al-I’dhah\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Ehzaz Ajmeri,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
