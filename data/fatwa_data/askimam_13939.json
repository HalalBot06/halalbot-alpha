  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni want to start a business,a shop, and put a friend to run it. I want to give him 50% of the profits. How do i do this according to the shariah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are three ways to go about with this:\n\n1. You set up the business with your own money and your friend runs the shop on a 50% profit basis. This implies that if there is no profit, then your friend will not get anything. If there is a loss, only you will be responsible, not your friend.\n\n2. Your friend be employed on a set monthly wage. He will be entitled to the wage irrespective of the business yielding a profit or not.\n\n3. Your friend also contributes to the set up of the business. He could also be actively engaged in the business. In this instance, he will get a share of the profit based on partnership as well as a wage. If there is a loss, he will have to bear that equivalent to his capital contribution.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
