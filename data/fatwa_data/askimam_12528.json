  "question": "I am planning to give my soon-to-be-born baby girl a name - Zareen Sofea. May I know what it means. Also, does \"Zarith\" mean anything in Islam/Arabic?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Zareen ? Urdu ? golden\n\n2. Zaareena: This word is perhaps derived from the Russian word Tzar ? a title is used for addressing a king in old Russia. Thus, Zaareenah or Tzareenah feminine of Zaar or Tzar may have been formed by adding the Taa` of Ta?neeth according to the Arabic grammar.\n\n3. Safiyyah - Pure; righteous; the most valuable portions of the spoils of battle; a palm tree bearing much fruit; name of one of the honorable wives of Rasoolullah sallallaahu-alayhi-wasallam.\n\n4. Zarith ? unable to locate.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
