  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIt is my lifelong dream to travel to see foreign lands and different cultures, but I have been taught from young that if one is by the means Gadj is first priority. Are people allowed to travel to experience life in other lands before one goes on Gadj?\n\nIt is something that weighs heavily on my heart as I try to live my life as a muslim not wanting to displease Allah but I cannot get rid of my desire to travel.\n\nI would appreciate any advice.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf is perfectly permissible in Shari’ah to travel the world and witness the powers of Allah. That does not have to be done through Gusht (going with the Tableegh Jamaat).\n\nAs a female, you will have to be accompanied by a male Mahram. Furthermore, the purpose should not be just a tour and a means of pleasure and entertainment. The purpose should be to see the different creations of Allah and ponder upon His Greatness. If you go through Gusht, that may be more spiritually enlightening as that will serve to interact with Muslim sisters and talk about Allah and His Deen and obedience to Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
