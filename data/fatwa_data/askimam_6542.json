  "answer": "QUESTION\nWould you please give me the detail of SURTH AL_NISSA verse 34.tell me under which circumstances a man can beat his wife according to this verse. In some book I have read that if a husband have that much amount of money that if he gives this money to his parents than nothing is left for his wife and if he gives that money to his wife nothing is left for his parents. Than according to Islamic rules he should gave this money to his wife. Is that is true.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Allah Ta'ala says in the noble Qur'aan: If you fear (with certainty)%0D%0Adisobedience of your wives, then firstly advise them verbally. If after%0D%0Aadvising them on this they still don't listen, then secondly stop relations%0D%0Awith them in the bedroom (by not having marital relations with them or%0D%0Afacing your back to them and sleeping), and if they still don't listen, then%0D%0Ahit them lightly. If they rectify and start obeying you, then treat them%0D%0Awell again. Verily, Allah Almighty is All-Great (this last part is a warning%0D%0Ato the men not to oppress their wives unjustly).%0D%0A%0D%0AHitting is only permissible in extreme cases and as a last option. The%0D%0Ahitting should be light without making wounds or marks. The objective is not%0D%0Ato hit and hurt your wife she is an Amaanat from Allah, but the object is to%0D%0Amerely jolt her to reform herself. (Tafseer Mazhari)%0D%0A2. A woman has rights over her husband, i.e. he must feed her and clothes%0D%0Aher and provide shelter for her in accordance to his means. This is%0D%0Aobligatory upon every married man. A man will only have to provide for his%0D%0Aparents if they are unable to earn care very poor.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
