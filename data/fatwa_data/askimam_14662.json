Your ex husband is the father of your child and he has the right of custody. If he has bad habits and that will be detrimental to the proper upbringing of your child then he does not have the right of custody. If your husband is ill treating you, and hitting you, you should make istikara and if you are guided and feel that you should not live with him, then request for divorse or make khula.\n\nMay Allah assist you aameen.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nThe ask imam site will not process questions from October 23 till October 27.
