  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am a soccer fan. The shirts for the teams that I like are sponsored by beer companies. Is it ever permisable for me to wear these jerseys in support of my teams?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nThere are two issues in your query:\n\n1.       Wearing clothing sponsored by beer companies\n\n2.       Being a fan of sports teams\n\n \n\nRegarding the first issue, since the jerseys have visible logos of the beer company, it is not appropriate for you to wear these clothes in public, as you will be helping the company advertise their harām product.  Allāh Ta’ālā says in the Qur’ān:\n\n \n\nوَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ (المائدة: 2)\n\nAnd assist one another in righteousness and piety, but do not assist one another in sin and transgression (al-Māidah: 2)\n\n \n\nAs for being a soccer fan and supporting sports teams, a few points are noteworthy.  First, many sports involve the exposure of the ‘awrah either due to shorts not covering until (and including) the knees or its tightness, such that the shape of the body is exposed.  Second, often people spend several hours watching or listening to sports, which distract them away from their obligations and priorities.  In numerous cases, this has even lead to marital problems or the delaying of salāh.  Third, some sports in its nature are not conducive to the Sharī’ah, such as boxing.  Moreover, watching and following sports teams very closely leads a person to become infatuated with certain players such that they want to imitate the players in their clothes, shoes, hairstyles, etc.  Taking the above into consideration, one should rather invest his/her time into a more constructive, beneficial activity free of the above harms.  Instead of a jersey in support of your team, if you don attire in support of the sunnah, it would be better and more rewarding.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
