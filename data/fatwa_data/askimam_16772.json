  "question": "Can i undergo Cosmetic Surgery due to the Injury i suffered when i was small?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhen I was about 9 years old or so my nose broke. It was painful and it began to swell. I remember in 4th grade there was an infection on the top of my nose. From then on my nose healed, but a big hump was formed on the top of my nose in the place where it swelled and the infection happened. Right now there is no health problem that I am affected by however it feels really uncomfortable for me with this bump on my nose. I don't like people looking at me from the side because I think that they are just staring at my nose. Also, I had a few children asking and sometimes randomly coming and touching my nose and asking why there is a hump on it. My relative who is a doctor informed me that he knows someone who can fix it. He is a really good Muslim and believes that this is not a sin giving the reason that I was not born with this hump on my nose and this is big hump is kind of abnormal. I wanted to be sure that this is not a sin. So, is it sinful to just undergo surgery basically only to fix the broken nose that happened a long time ago?\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIn principle, it is not permissible to have a cosmetic procedure done for the sake of beautification or if one does not have a valid medical reason to do so. Allah Ta'ala says in the Holy Quran:\n\nولاضلنهم و لامنينهم و لامرنهم فليبتكن آذان الانعام و لامرنهم فليغيرن خلق الله و من يتخذ الشيطان وليا منم دون الله فقد خسر خسرانا مبينا\n\n\"And I will lead them astray and I will tempt them with false hopes and give them my order so they shall slit the ears of cattle and I will give them my order so they shall alter the creation of Allah.  And whoever takes the Satan as friend instead of Allah has incurred an obvious loss.\" (4:119)\n\nCommentators of the Holy Quran have stated that those who permanently change their physical appearance are also included under this ayah. To deface the nature created by Allah is what shaytan desires.\n\nOur bodies are an amanah (trust) given to us by Allah Ta'ala, thus it is unlawful to tamper with them in any way. If one does so, he will be sinful for taghyeer khalq Allah (changing the nature created by Allah).\n\nHowever, if there is a genuine need then Shari'ah has granted permissibility for such procedures under certain such circumstances.\n\nAn example of this can be given in a Hadith. A Sahabi by the name of Arfajah ibn Aswad (RadiyAllahu Anhu) damaged his nose in the Battle of Kulab. He replaced it first with silver, and then with a nose made of gold, with the order and consent of the Messenger of Allah (Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam). (Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i)\n\nIn your case, it will be permissible to undergo a procedure to remove the lump since it was the result of a broken nose and it was not something that is natural.\n\n(Jadid Fiqhi Masa'il, Vol. 1, P. 327, Na'eemiyya)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
