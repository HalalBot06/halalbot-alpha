  "question": "What is the ruling on post mortems (autopy), particularly those requested by the police?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is the ruling on post mortems, particularly those requested by the police? What does the Quran and Hadith say on this matter, besides the saying \"beaking the bones of the dead is like breaking the bones of the living.\" My family is much on debate on this issue. Can you refer me to additional information on this matter? So far I have only two references: Yahya related to me from Malik that he had heard that A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to say, \"Breaking the bone of a muslim when he is dead is like breaking it when he is alive.\" She meant if done in wrong action. - Malik Muwatta, Book 16: Burials,Number: 16.15.45: \"But if one is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits,- then is he guiltless.\" - Al Baqara, Al Qur'an\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nISLAM AND THE AUTOPSY%0D%0AMahomed A. Dada, MB ChB, MMed (Forensic Path), DOM, MMed (Anat Path), DABFE,%0D%0ADABFM, FRIPHH.%0D%0A%0D%0AProfessor and Head of Department of Forensic Medicine, University of Natal.%0D%0A%0D%0AJIMASA-DEC 1998%2FRAMADAAN 1419 VOL4, NO3%0D%0A\"Wherever you may be death will overtake you, though you remain even in%0D%0Alofty towers.\"(Quran 4:78)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe death of a patient can be as devastating to a physician as it is to the%0D%0Afamily of the deceased. A good physician needs to know how to break the news%0D%0Aof such an event to the family and by his knowledge of his patient will be%0D%0Aable to provide information to help the family in their hour of need. In the%0D%0Acase of a death of a Muslim patient it is essential that the doctor%0D%0Aunderstand the religious and cultural aspects of burial and attitudes%0D%0Atowards the autopsy.%0D%0A%0D%0AIgnorance of South African law and myths about the autopsy has led to%0D%0Aprolonging the grief of bereaved families and has prompted us to write this%0D%0Aarticle which we hope will clarify some of the problem issues and be a focus%0D%0Afor further discussion. It is the duty of the medical practitioner to issue%0D%0Aa death certificate (Form BI-1663, previously BI-12) on the death of his%0D%0Apatient. The certificate must be issued immediately. In order to fill in the%0D%0Adeath certificate correctly, the doctor must classify every death according%0D%0Ato its cause; that is, natural or unnatural (see below for discussion). If%0D%0Athe death was due to a notifiable disease then the doctor must immediately%0D%0Anotify the local health authority.1%0D%0A%0D%0AThis differentiation between deaths due to natural or unnatural causes has%0D%0Afar-reaching legal consequences for the deceased's next of kin, for example,%0D%0Awhether there is to be a police inquiry leading to a criminal and%2For civil%0D%0Aaction. This decision may not always be easy, and what may appear as natural%0D%0Acauses may not be so, or vice-versa. An incorrect choice could have major%0D%0Aimpact on the deceased's family in terms of possible exhumation being%0D%0Acarried out or failure of insurance companies to pay out policies on the%0D%0Adeceased's life. Most problems arise because of confusion about the%0D%0Aformulation of the cause of death and the death certificate.%0D%0A%0D%0AWHAT IS UNNATURAL DEATH?%0D%0AThe distinction between natural and unnatural death is difficult and to some%0D%0Aextent based on convention within our society rather than rules of law.%0D%0AThere is no definition of what is natural or unnatural death (\"anaesthetic%0D%0Adeath\" being the one exception) and the doctor or magistrate must use%0D%0Amedical evidence and opinion together with the current values of our society%0D%0Ato make a judgement on the issue. By convention, if the following aspects%0D%0Aare present a death may be classified as unnatural.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"External Factors\"%0D%0ADeaths due to the application of force on the body and physical and chemical%0D%0Afactors. These include:%0D%0A* physical factors - heat, cold, radiation%0D%0A* chemical factors - chemical surface burns%2Fingestion of drugs and poisons%0D%0A* mechanical factors -road traffic accidents, gunshot wounds, assaults%0D%0A%0D%0AThe force applied may be direct or indirect, with or without complications,%0D%0Ae.g. urinary tract infection and septicaemia occurring 13 months after motor%0D%0Avehicle accident in which there was spinal cord damage and paraplegia.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"Anaesthetic Deaths\"%0D%0ADeaths in terms of Section 56 of the Medical, Dental and Supplementary%0D%0AHealth Services Professions Act, 1974, (this is that one exception), which%0D%0Astates:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"If a person dies under the influence of a local or general anaesthetic or%0D%0Awhere the administration of such an anaesthetic may have played a role in%0D%0Athe death of the deceased, such a death is not regarded as natural and must%0D%0Abe reported to a police officer\".%0D%0A%0D%0AIn order to determine whether a death will fall under the above category, it%0D%0Ais necessary to ask the following pertinent questions:%0D%0Aa) Was the patient under the influence of local or general anaesthetic?%0D%0A%0D%0AThe answer will depend on the clinical impression as to whether the patient%0D%0Awas able to act consciously or not. That is, if the patient has recovered%0D%0Aconsciousness, or has been restored to the condition he or she was in prior%0D%0Ato the administration of the anaesthetic, that anaesthesia is not%0D%0Aresponsible for the subsequent death of the patient. However, in some cases,%0D%0Aanaesthesia may contribute to delayed deaths e.g. liver failure induced by%0D%0Athe administration of halothane. As long as a causal relationship exists%0D%0Abetween the administration of the anaesthetic and the death, the death%0D%0Acannot be considered to be due to natural causes.%0D%0A%0D%0Ab) Did the anaesthetic play a contributory role in the death of the patient?%0D%0A%0D%0AIf the patient would not have died had an anaesthetic not been administered,%0D%0Ait must be taken for granted that the anaesthetic contributed to the death.%0D%0ADeaths due to the disease%2Finjury for which the patient originally presented%0D%0Aand deaths due to surgical mishaps, blood transfusion reaction and%0D%0Aidiosyncratic drug reactions are still regarded as \" anaesthetic death\" as%0D%0Along as it is deemed that the patient was still under the influence of the%0D%0Aanaesthetic.%0D%0A%0D%0Ac) Is there a time period for a death to be classified as an \"anaesthetic%0D%0Adeath\"?%0D%0A%0D%0AContrary to popular belief among clinicians, there is no time limit to the%0D%0Adefinition of an anaesthetic death (No 24-hour rule).%0D%0A%0D%0Ad) What about deaths associated with diagnostic and%2For therapeutic%0D%0Aprocedures?%0D%0A%0D%0ADeaths due to diagnostic%2Ftherapeutic procedures are grouped under the%0D%0A\"anaesthetic deaths\"; i.e. unnatural deaths. These deaths may well fall%0D%0Aunder the \"act or omission\" criteria of unnatural deaths described below.%0D%0A%0D%0ASUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED DEATHS%0D%0AWhere a medical practitioner is unable to provide a death certificate of%0D%0Anatural causes; e.g. the practitioner has not treated the deceased whose%0D%0Adeath was not only sudden and unexpected but also unexplained. These deaths%0D%0Aregarded as \"unnatural\" until the pathologist, on the basis of an autopsy or%0D%0Amore information from the police and%2For family, may certify the death as%0D%0Abeing due to a natural cause.%0D%0A%0D%0AACTS OF COMMISSION OR OMISSION%0D%0ADeath, normally considered being due to natural causes, but which in the%0D%0Amedical practitioner's opinion was caused by an act (of commission) or (act%0D%0Aof) omission on the part of a person or persons, e.g. failure of a medical%0D%0Apractitioner to treat a non-fatal condition and where such an omission%0D%0Acontributed to the patient's death. There is no time limit within which an%0D%0Ainjury or incident may only be related to subsequent death. In other words,%0D%0Ano matter what the interval of time elapses between an injury and subsequent%0D%0Adeath, as long as there exists a causal relationship, then the death cannot%0D%0Abe regarded as natural.%0D%0A%0D%0ADeath, in a case where a specific act of omission is suspected, must be%0D%0Aconsidered to be as a result of unnatural causes, and must be reported to%0D%0Athe magistrate. The magistrate, and not the medical practitioner, must then%0D%0Adecide whether the act or omission by the person concerned involved or%0D%0Aamounted to an offence. The above applies most often to deaths under medical%0D%0Atreatment.%0D%0A%0D%0AHere again, the doctor is empowered to use his professional discretion, e.g.%0D%0Ain meconium aspiration following foetal distress, as a result of delayed%0D%0Alabour perhaps because the doctor did not refer the mother timeously to%0D%0Ahospital for expert attention (negligence), may be regarded as unnatural.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE NEW DEATH CERTIFICATE (BI 1663)%0D%0ARecently, the new death certificate was introduced in a two-page format. The%0D%0Afirst page will have demographic details of the patient and will simply%0D%0Astate whether the death was due to natural or unnatural causes.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe second page of the new certificate will contain the complete diagnosis.%0D%0AAt present the 2nd page is placed in an envelope and stapled to the first%0D%0Apage and handed to the person registering the death. This will prevent%0D%0Adisclosure of the cause of death to unauthorised persons. A perceived%0D%0Aadvantage of the new form is that diagnoses such as AIDS can be written on%0D%0Athe death certificate with the assurance that unauthorised disclosure will%0D%0Anot stigmatise the family of the deceased.%0D%0A%0D%0ACAUSE OF DEATH (COD) STATEMENT (Part G, Page 2 of BI-1663)%0D%0AThe Underlying Cause of Death (UCOD) has been defined as \"(a) the disease or%0D%0Ainjury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death,%0D%0Aor (b) the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the%0D%0Afatal injury\".%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is the underlying cause of death that will determine whether a death is%0D%0Anatural or not. Part 1 is formatted so that sequential information is%0D%0Areported with one condition per line, starting with the most recent%0D%0Acondition on the top line and going backward in time on progressively lower%0D%0Alines. Each condition can cause the one on the line above it. It is not%0D%0Aalways necessary to use all of the lines in Part 1. Although rarely needed,%0D%0Aextra lines may be added. The top line (A) should always be used. Part 2 is%0D%0Afor any other significant condition (Contributory cause) that contributed to%0D%0Athe fatal outcome, but was not related to the disease or condition directly%0D%0Acausing death.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above terms must be differentiated from:%0D%0A* manner of death which refers to the circumstances of how the cause of%0D%0Adeath arose (natural, accidental, suicide, homicide, iatrogenic or%0D%0Aundetermined)%0D%0A*mechanism of death which refers to the physiologic derangement or%0D%0Abiochemical disturbance produced by a cause of death e.g. in a stab wound of%0D%0Athe heart (cause of death), the mechanism of death may be cardiac tamponade%0D%0Aor hypovolaemic shock. Many practitioners mistakenly attribute the cause of%0D%0Adeath to the mechanism of death.%0D%0A%0D%0AGUIDELINES TO THE COMPLETION OF THE CAUSE OF DEATH STATEMENT%0D%0A(1) Make every effort to report an etiologically specific underlying cause%0D%0Aof death.%0D%0A(2) Try to use a Sequential Part 1 Format, if possible.%0D%0A(3) Err on the side of reporting too much rather than too little.%0D%0A(4) DO NOT report symptoms or signs.%0D%0A(5) DO NOT report a condition if its existence in the patient is obvious%0D%0Abased on another reported condition.%0D%0A(6) DO NOT oversimplify%0D%0A(7) DO NOT use abbreviations%0D%0A(8) DO NOT report mechanistic terminal events such as:%0D%0A* cardiac arrest%0D%0A* asystole%0D%0A* cardiopulmonary arrest%0D%0A* respiratory arrest%0D%0A* electromechanical dissociation%0D%0A* ventricular fibrillation%0D%0A%0D%0AMATERNAL DEATHS%0D%0AThe World Health Assembly (1990) adopted a recommendation that countries%0D%0Ashould consider the inclusion on the death certificate of questions about%0D%0Athe current pregnancy and pregnancy within one year preceding death. As a%0D%0Aresult legislation was passed on 3rd October 1997 making it mandatory to%0D%0Areport all maternal deaths. A National Committee for the Confidential%0D%0AEnquiry into Maternal Deaths has been established to perform confidential%0D%0Aenquiries into maternal deaths. A detailed questionnaire has been developed%0D%0Aby the Department of Health and is to be filled in by all health care%0D%0Apersonnel involved.%0D%0A%0D%0APROBLEMS WITH EXAMINATION OF THE BODY IN ISLAMIC LAW%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Consent for an autopsy%0D%0AThe Bill of Rights guarantees the right to freedom of conscience, religion,%0D%0Athought, belief and opinion.2 This right is not absolute and may be%0D%0Asuspended for the benefit of the community or for the pursuit of justice. In%0D%0Aunnatural deaths, consent from the family is not required as the autopsy is%0D%0Acarried out on the instruction or order of a legal authority (magistrate)%0D%0Aand the examination is directed towards the public good.3%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the case of natural deaths consent may be given by the deceased%0D%0Ahim%2Fherself before death by way of a will (testament), orally before two%0D%0Awitnesses who must be older than 14 years of age or by the wearing of an%0D%0Aidentification bracelet%2Ftag such as \"Medic-Alert\". Alternatively, the%0D%0Aattending doctor may requests an autopsy to determine more precisely the%0D%0Acause of death or for a specific scientific purpose.4 Authorisation is%0D%0Aobtained from the magistrate, doctor in charge of the mortuary or a person%0D%0Adesignated by him%2Fher, or the superintendent of the hospital%2Finstitution%0D%0Aconcerned. Consent from the family is not a legal prerequisite for an%0D%0Aautopsy in the case of a natural death. It is for ethical reasons that we%0D%0Aapproach the family for permission for a post-mortem examination. In the%0D%0Acase of a Muslim patient permission from the next of kin must be obtained in%0D%0Athe following order of priority:5%0D%0A1. father, son, mother%0D%0A2. siblings, wife, grandfather, grandson%0D%0A3. paternal and maternal uncles cousins%0D%0AAlthough the wife may not be a blood relative she is given a high ranking as%0D%0Aone would logically expect. We must at all times try to respect the%0D%0Afamilies' religious and personal beliefs. \"Overriding\" the family's%0D%0Aobjections is only warranted for the greater good of the community at large%0D%0Aand for statutory and medico-legal reasons. This feeling was echoed by the%0D%0AFatwa Committee at Al-Azhar (January 1982) who concluded that if medical%0D%0Astudents learn from post-mortems, if justice prevails through them and if%0D%0Acontagious diseases can be controlled through them, then benefits indeed%0D%0Aoutnumber damages, provided that these examinations are performed only when%0D%0Anecessary.6%0D%0A2. Are we violating the sanctity of the human body by performing a%0D%0Apost-mortem?%0D%0A\"The breaking of the bone of a dead person is like breaking the bone of a%0D%0Alive person\"(Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal)%0D%0AIn the \"Al-Jawaab\" column in the An-Noor, a bimonthly Islamic publication,%0D%0Aan unnamed author makes a passionate attack on the practice of the autopsy%0D%0Aand describes it as a \"crude, futile and dishonourable practice of%0D%0Amutilating the human body\".7 He goes on to regard the autopsy as part of the%0D%0Aconspiracy on the part of the \"non-Muslims\" against Islam. In the entire%0D%0Adiscourse no attempt is made to refer to any fatwa or other form of%0D%0A%0Areference.%0D%0ASome 'ulama' often confuse muthlah as meaning mutilation occurring with an%0D%0Aautopsy. The autopsy, carried out under the instruction of a legal%0D%0Aauthority, is a scientific examination of the dead body by a medical%0D%0Apractitioner with the aim directed towards the public good. Whereas, the%0D%0Aterm muthlah refers to the malicious desecration of a body because of hatred%0D%0Aas was the case with the body of hadrat Hamza (r.a.) by Hindah; who made a%0D%0Agarland from the nose and ears of his dead body.%0D%0AIn an Islamic judicial system an autopsy is not necessary if the accused%0D%0Aconfesses to murder before the judge. However, most murderers will try to%0D%0Adestroy evidence of their crime to try to make the death appear as suicide.%0D%0AIn these cases it would be necessary to conduct an autopsy to determine the%0D%0Acause and manner of death,8 which under the circumstances, would be%0D%0Apermissible by Islamic Law.%0D%0AIn the South African situation as it is in most countries that are not%0D%0Agoverned by Shariah law, it is mandatory to do a post-mortem examination on%0D%0Aall cases of unnatural deaths and in some cases of natural deaths. This is%0D%0Anot something new, as the Islamic legal maxim, \"necessity permits the%0D%0Aforbidden\" was invoked to investigate crime in the days of Averroes [Ibn%0D%0ARushd], Avicenna [Ibn Sina] and Rhazes [Razi] [10-12 C]. Furthermore,%0D%0Adissection of cadavers in Departments of Anatomy are permitted Islamically,%0D%0Aand the janazah (funeral) salah (prayer) is delayed until the body has%0D%0Ataught the dissector what he%2Fshe needs to know.%0D%0A3. Should the burial be postponed so that an autopsy may be performed?9%0D%0A\"Hasten the burial of the deceased\" (Hadith)%0D%0AIt is commendable that after death of a Muslim his dead body should be%0D%0Aburied as soon as possible. Unfortunately, the performance of an autopsy%0D%0Awill cause a delay in the burial of the deceased and will result in the body%0D%0Abeing transferred from place to place. Sympathetic treatment by the police%0D%0Aand the Department of Health staff has now reduced this delay to a minimum%0D%0Adue to a 7-day a week autopsy service now being in place in most centres.%0D%0AThe Islamic Ruling is to bury the dead as soon as possible, but there is%0D%0Aalways an exception to the rule. Thus, if there is any compelling reason to%0D%0Adelay the burial, it can be done. The neccessity of carrying out an autopsy%0D%0Awould be one of the exceptions to the rule.%0D%0AACKNOWLEGEMENTS%0D%0AThe author wishes to thank the following persons for their assistance: Prof.%0D%0ASS Nadvi, Head of Department of Islamic Studies, University of%0D%0ADurban-Westville, Dr SR Naidoo, Department of Forensic Medicine, University%0D%0Aof Natal, Dr S.
