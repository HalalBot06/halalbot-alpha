  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs there a specific theme on which a person should direct his or her utmost attention to when praying namaaz? What are the kinds of things that one is eligible to think about during prayer?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe theme in Salaat is the greatness of Allah and expressing one’s humility before Allah. During the Qiyaam (standing posture), concentrate on the words of the Qur’aan. That is actually a discussion between the individual and Allah.\n\nWhen going into Ruku and Sajdah, that is an expression of humbleness and submission to Allah. Ponder upon the Tasbihs of Ruku and Sajdah – Subhaana rabbiyal azeem (Pure is my Rabb who is Great), Subhaana rabbiyal a’alaa (Pure is my Rabb who is exalted). When moving from one posture to another, Allaahu Akbar is recited which means Allah is the Greatest. The entire Salaat, from beginning to ending is an expression of submission and slavery to Allah, the Almighty, the Greatest, The Doer, the Most Powerful, the Sustainer, the Cherisher, the Reckoner on the day of Judgment and the Most Merciful.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
