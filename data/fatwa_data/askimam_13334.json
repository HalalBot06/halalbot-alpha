  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nConcerning the Islam of our Nabi's parents\n\nI myself have no doubt on these issues but there is a lot of hassle from the Salafi brothers.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n3. Some say they are Kaafir and Jahannum and some say they are Jannatis. There are 3 opinions,\n\na. They died on Kufr and Shirk but will not be punished because they died before Nubuwwat. Allah Ta’ala says, ‘We don’t punish any group as long as we don’t send a Nabi.’\n\nb. They died on Kufr and Shirk but were given life again and brought Imaan on Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nc. They both refrained from idol worship and Shirk through their intelligence or because of following the Deen of Ibraaheem (Alayhis salaam). They heard about coming of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and waiting for his arrival and made a firm determination that if they are alive at the time of his Nubuwwat, then they will bring Imaan on his. Therefore, although Imaan bil Tafseel is not established but Imaan ijmaaliy is established. (Majmoo’al Fataawa pg.93)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
