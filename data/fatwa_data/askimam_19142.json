  "question": "Is intercourse with one’s wife permissible after the 10th day of menstrual bleeding?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy wife was on her period, but it lasted for more than 10 days. After the ten days she had done ghusl, and by the 12th day it seemed as if it had stopped but after making love she was bleeding again. It is haram during menstruation but I had read somewhere that after ten days it is permissible to offer salah and do everything else after ghusl has been performed. Is it haraam that there was intercourse?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nAccording to the Hanafi position, a woman's Hayd (menstrual period) is a minimum of 3 days and a maximum of 10 days.\n\n \n\nو اقل الحيض ثلاثة ايام و اوسطه خمسة و اكثره عشرة\n\n(Nurul Idaah, p. 48, Al-Misbah)\n\n \n\nIf she continues to bleed after 10 days, it is considered istihaadha (chronic discharge) and she must perform prayer and fast (if it is Ramadan). Intercourse is also permissible while a woman experiences istihaadha.\n\n \n\nوالاستحاضة دم نقص عن ثلاثة ايام او زاد على عشرة في الحيض.......والاستحاضة كرعاف داءم لا يمنع صلاة و لا صوما و لا وطا\n\n(Nurul-Idaah, p. 48, 50. Al-Misbah)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMuftī Asif Umar\nWashington, DC (USA)\n\nConcurred by:\n\nMuftī Abrar Mirza\nChicago, IL (USA)\n\nUnder the Supervision of Muftī Ebrahim Desai (South Africa)\n\n 2011-01-19\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER – AskImam.org questions\nAskImam.org answers issues pertaining to Sharī’ah.
