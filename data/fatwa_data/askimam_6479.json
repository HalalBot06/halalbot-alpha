  "question": "I have been brought up in a community where we have a common problem between the \"sunni\" and \"Thabligh\"?who are the sunni's and who are the thablighs and where did SALAAMI originate from?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nLiterally speaking, a Tableeghi or the word Tabligh, can be attributed to%0D%0Aany person who invites others and conveys the message of Islam. Similarly,%0D%0Athe literal meaning of Sunni is any person who is a follower and practices%0D%0Aon the teachings of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Therefore, in%0D%0Areality, a Tableeghi and a Sunni are both one and the same and in essence%0D%0Arefers to that person who is following the blessed practice of Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), conveys and invites people towards Islam.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, in today's times, lots of people have a misconception with regards%0D%0Ato the above because of which they have formed separate groups and divided%0D%0Athemselves. Those who are affiliated to Tableegh are known as Tableeghis.%0D%0AThey basically convey the message of Islam in accordance to certain%0D%0Aprinciples laid down by Ulama of the past. On the other hand, those who are%0D%0Aaffiliated with Salaami are called Sunni. They claim to have true love for%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Here again, some people who are%0D%0Aaffiliated to the Sunni have deviated due to incorrect beliefs. They believe%0D%0Athat Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is Omnipresent and makes his present%0D%0Aat their Salaami, etc. This is incorrect. However, there are others who have%0D%0Acorrect beliefs and stress on the importance of love for Nabi (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
