  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat should one do if we want to increase our success in this world and the live after. Also if we want success in studies as a student, and increase our wealth for the sake of spending in the name of Allah and making mosques. I love to give charity and make mosques but i'm still a student and don't have the money. How can I pray to Allah to give me lots of money to make big mosques. And how can I get satisfaction\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Adherence to the Sunnah guarantees success in this life as well as the hereafter.\n\n2. The good intention that you have for spending in charity will, insha Allah, enable you to acquire the reward provided your intention is sincere.\n\n3. You donâ€™t have to spend huge amounts of money to gain the pleasure of Allah. Even a single Dollar with sincerity is far more superior that spending huge amounts without that level of sincerity.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
