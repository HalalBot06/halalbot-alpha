  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nI hope that you are doing fine.\n\nRegarding my request at the embassy for a student visa I need a registration document from your madrasah.\n\nThe document you have sent to me many months ago is expired. (March 01 2005)\n\nIf the date of my arrival does not correspond with the date mentionned in the document, they will refuse my student visa appliction. As you can see from the previous email that I have sent you, I would be arriving August 31 at Durban.\n\nDue to the time that is required for this bureaucracy I will be needing the registration document before the 10th of August.\n\nWhen you did sent me the document before, it took too much time for it to arrive, therefor if you could sent it to the fax number 0032/26.44.98.44 (0032 being the country code and 02/644.98.44 the fax number within belgium) then it would make things easier for me.\n\nHowever, I am not certain as they will accept a faxcopy of the official document. Just to be certain, please send it by post also. I will compensate for it if needed.\n\n \n\nDjazakumAllaah Khairun,\n\nKhalil Kevin Johnson,\n\n \n\nBelgium.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Kindly remind us a few days before your arrival in Durban. We will, insha Allah, send someone to pick you up from the airport. I suggest you phone us also from the airport in Johannesburg. \n\n2. Ideally, you should abstain even from the Halaal food prepared by the airlines due to a fear of contamination. Rather carry your own food or order a fruit meal. Alternatively, you may consume the tea, biscuits, etc. served in the plane.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
