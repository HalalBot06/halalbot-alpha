  "answer": "QUESTION\nmy question is the apostles of Esa(A.s) didn't know that Esa(A.S) was lifted upto heaven by the almighty allah,they believed that jesus(Esa)crucified and they preached the same belief to the people and even today the christian believe it.the question is why did allah allow the false belief to be spread till 610 yrs.beacause they quran was revealed atfer 610 years.and those who are born in non-muslim families, is it their fault if they are dammed into hell forever? please give answer according Quran and hadidht .send me verses of quran if any. may Allah bless u...salamallaikum.thankyou\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAllah Taa’la has revealed the Quraan as a guidance for mankind till the last day. The Quraan is the final book of Allah and abrogates all prior revealed heavenly scriptures. Allah explains the incident of Essa (Alayhis Salaam) in the Quraan in much detail. Allah mentions that Essa (Alayhis Salaam) has not been crucified or killed, but Allah has lifted him to the heavens (Surah Baqarah). The book of Allah has signs of Haqq and truth within it. It is the choice of every understanding person to realize the truth of Islam and Deen and accept it. Allah states that the non-Muslims know the truth of Islam but reject out of pride and stubbornness. Allah states, “We have shown them both the paths (good and bad)” (Surah Balad). In another verse of the Quraan Allah exhorts, “Say (Oh! Muhammed) the truth has been revealed from your Rabb (Lord), whoever wishes to accept should do so and whoever wishes to reject should do so, Allah has prepared for those who reject, fire that would engulf them…”(Surah Kahf).  Therefore, it is improper to question why Allah has allowed a false belief to spread. Allah is most forgiving and grants respite to those who rebel against His Divine Law. It is possible that they will repent and turn towards Allah and become His faithful and obedient servants.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best,\n\nWasalam,\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
