  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan I do business with a Shia as a partner? Assalam alaikum I am a sunni muslim alhamdullilah and an old student of mine approached me and wanted me to work with him as a partner in business. I gave my word that I will work with. But later I found that he is a Shia. What is your advice. Should I say no or I start business with him. JazakAllah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo enter into a partnership with a Kaafir is permissible. However, our advise to you would be not to enter into such a partnership. Shi?as are known to be treacherous, and regard it as a virtue to harm Muslims.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
