  "question": "Mufti Saheb can you please tell me whether Imam Abu Hanifa’s ruling on the beard is that, it only becomes haraam (sinful) for shaving the beard if you made the intention to keep it.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat I mean is that you intended to keep the beard, but for some petty reason you trimmed it to less than a fist. Or is the ruling haraam at all times.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n'For Muslim males to grow a beard is Waajib (compulsory), and to let it grow\na fist length is Waajib. Without any Sharée reason to cut or shave is Haraam\n(totally prohibited). He who does so is a Faasiq (sinner) and to shorten it\nless than a fist length is Makruh Tahrimi (near Haraam).' Dari Aur Ambiyaa\nKi Sunnate, Mufti Saeed Palanpuri.\n\nIt is prohibited to shave or trim the beard lesser than the fist of a hand\nat all times. Not only when you intended to keep the beard.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
