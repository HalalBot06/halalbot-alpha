  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamualaikum wa Rehmetullah Is eating of mushrooms allowed? I heard it is not from a Pure/Good Source? Also I would like to suggest that you accept Questions at any time as it is night in some part of world when you open for Fatwa. I am aware about your limitations but I suggest that you Answer to Questions based on Priority/Importance as per your Convenience. I highly Appreciate your Great service to Mankind. It is good to note that even Such Good Informative/Interactive sites are available on Internet where there are so many bad sites. May Allah Give you Best Reward for it. Wassalaam, Adil Ahmed\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Mushroom is from mudn'.\n'Mun' is an Arabic word in the Qur'aan, literally meaning favour.\nContextually, Allah Ta'ala refers to the fruits of paradise (fruits without\nfarming) given to the Jews when they were stranded in a valley for forty\nyears. Similarly, mushroom is a bounty of Allah Ta'ala which grows after\nrains. It is, therefore, permissible to eat mushrooms. However, one must\nexercise precaution as poisonous mushrooms also grow.\n2. Jazaakumullah for your suggestion. We have taken note of it.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
