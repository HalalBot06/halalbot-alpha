  "question": "With ref. to Q6042, Isha and Fajr times further up North of London are 11 pm and 3 am respectively. The old and the young have a tough time staying up late and getting up early.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAny suggestions (other than moving out of here)? Can they during the summer, pray Isha? after a defined interval after Maghrib and go to bed, in these higher latitudes?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPerforming the Isha Salaah any time before 11 PM will never be valid\naccording to all four math-habs.\n\nWe have one suggestion, and this applies specifically to the young, old and\nweak. They may delay their Isha to until a few minutes before 3 AM (Subh\nSaadiq). Then can wait a few minutes and perform Fajr after 3 AM. In this\nway they only have to get up once.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
