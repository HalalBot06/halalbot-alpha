Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] should also read certain Aayaat from%0D%0Athe Qur'aan and then blow on to his right hand, and then rub that hand on%0D%0Athe affected area. However, one must believe that it is Allah who gives the%0D%0Ashifaa cure and not the person or the water%2Foil and the like. It is not%0D%0Apermissible to recite Faatiha on food, etc. as a custom.%0D%0A2. For a woman to beautify herself for her husband by wearing a nose ring is%0D%0Apermissible. If this nose ring is to be worn for the reason of imitating%0D%0Aanother culture, e.g. Hindu, etc. then such an act becomes prohibited. Nabi%0D%0A[Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] said, 'Whosoever imitates a nation is of them'%0D%0A.%0D%0A3. Gous paak is the term widely used in the Indo pak subcontinent referring%0D%0Ato Muhyiddeen Abdul-Qaadir Jilani [ra]. At a young age, he left his home and%0D%0Awent to study in Baghdad under prominent Hanbali Ulama. Throughout his life,%0D%0Apeople were influenced by his style and content of his lectures. Today,%0D%0Aunfortunately, many people do acts of Bid'at and Shirk and attribute it to%0D%0Ahim.%0D%0A4. Pouring of water on the kabr has no Shari'ah basis. It was during the%0D%0Atime of Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] that when passing by two Qabars%0D%0Athat he heard their punishment and then placed two leaves in the two Qabrs%0D%0Aand made du'aa that they be given rest until these leaves dry.%0D%0A5. The singing of a naaths and the like on a specific night, like Thursday,%0D%0Ais a Bid'ah (innovation) in Deen. There is no authentic proof in the Shari'%0D%0Aah that this was the practice of Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam[ or his%0D%0Arighteous companions.%0D%0A6. It was the practise of Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] on the night of%0D%0AJumu'ah should recite Surah al-Kahf. This Surah is the protection against%0D%0Athe Dajjaal.%0D%0A7. The visiting of their Darghas, etc. to make du'aa for the buried is%0D%0Apermissible. However, to ask the buried for help or to intercede for you is%0D%0Anot acceptable in the Shari'ah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
