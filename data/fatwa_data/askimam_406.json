  "question": "Are we faulting by keeping the Nikaah simple i.e. a week night with only the relevant parties present, and then feeding a small circle of friends and family perhaps 2 to 3 days later ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Nikah should be simple. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said,\n'The most blessed Nikah is that in which least expenses are incurred.'\n(Mishkaat vol.2)\n\nIf the feeding referred to is the Walimah, there is no need to delay the\nWalimah by 2 or 3 days. It is Sunnah to have the Walimah the next day after\nthe union between the husband and wife.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
