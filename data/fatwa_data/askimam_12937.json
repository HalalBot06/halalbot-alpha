  "question": "What exactly did RASOLULLAH SAW eat in Ramadan?For Ifthar,Sehri and in between?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe entire year round, it was the practice of Nabi (sallalahu Alaihi wasallam) to eat whatever Allah Ta'ala made available. Nabi (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) would not have a specific menu set for him.\n\nGenerally dates would be consumed with water to drink. If bread was available it would be eaten with some gravy. Thus the salient characteristic of the meals of Nabi (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) was simplicity.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Husain Kadodia\nSTUDENT: Darul Ifta"
