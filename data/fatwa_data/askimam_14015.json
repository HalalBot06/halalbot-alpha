  "question": "Under what conditions, can muslims of a country disobey and rebel against their fasiq and fajir muslim ruler in the Hanafi Fiqh?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) There is a hadith in which it is said that if a person sees an evil and feels bad in his heart, then this is the lowest level of Iman. I want to ask that if a person sees an evil and does not feel bad in his heart, then will he/she be completely devoid of Iman in his heart? Will such a person enter paradise?\n\n(2) Is there any need for Universal (Combined) Khilafah as in times of the Sahaba? (Radiallahu Anhu)\n\n(3) Under what conditions, can muslims of a country disobey and rebel against their fasiq and fajir muslim ruler in the Hanafi Fiqh?\n\nMay Allah (SWT) give you reward for this great service, in the hereafter. (Ameen)\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The slightest hint of such a feeling is sufficient. If he does not even have this degree in his heart, his Imaan in that respect is deficient. This does not mean that he ceases to be a Muslim and will not enter paradise.\n\n2. There is always a need for such Khilaafah.\n\n3. If the very Deen itself is threatened, as a last resort they can rebel against the ruler.\n\nAnd Allah Taâ€™ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
