  "question": "Is it permissible to neuter a cat to prevent it from breeding?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWe purchased a kitten as a pet and don't want that it meet with other cats and reproduce (produce kittens). It is allowed to neuter or spade (alter sexual organs so that they become disfunctional) our cat so that it can not longer reproduce?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nYes, it is permissible to neuter your cat if it is done so for a valid reason (i.e. it is beneficial or prevents a harm).\n\nNeutering your cat to prevent it from breeding is a valid reason.\n\nSee Ask Imam #19124 for further details. \n\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
