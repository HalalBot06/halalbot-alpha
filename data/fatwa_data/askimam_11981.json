  "question": "Do you know anything about “khatam-e-khajgani”?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDo you know anything about ?khatam-e-khajgani?? Its where few people sit together to read zikr on pieces of almond shells or anything to keep count of the number, one says out loud the zikr i.e. subhanallah and then the rest take some pieces and read and throw the pieces in the middle where all the pieces gather then the same person says another type of zikr and so on and in the end a prayer is recited so that Allah would solve a problem occurred or any kind of need. Is this kind of zikr allowed as I heard that once this incedent happened after the prophet?s death where few sahaba were sitting together doing the same thing, and a great sahabi disagreed on this act? Please clarify whether this is allowed or not?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, if there is no prohibition for an act in Shari?ah, that act will be permissible if it does not violate other principles of the Shari?ah. Since there is no prohibition of khatam-e-khajgaan in Shari?ah, the act will be permissible on condition one does not regard the act as compulsory. If the practise of khatm-e-khajgaan is regarded to be compulsory in anyway, by either imposing on people the practice or reproaching those who do not participate in the act, then it will not be permissible and it will be regarded as an act of bid?ah.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe incident in reference is that of Abdullah ibn Mas?ood [Radhiallaahu anhu]. It was the era of the Sahaaba [Radhiallaahu anhum] and establishing Sunnah. It was necessary for a Sahaabi to oppose any act not practised by or in the presence of Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] as the silence of a Sahaabi [Radhiallaahu anhu] will indicate the act to be Sunnah as is the case in taraweeh and many other acts. The opposition of the Sahaabi [Radhiallaahu anhu] does not mean the act was not mubaah (permissible).%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
