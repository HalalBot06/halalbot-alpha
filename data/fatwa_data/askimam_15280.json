  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI know that lottery is haram because it is equal to gambling. But i would like to know whether a lotto in haram in which the participant or winner is not investing any money?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nYour query is not clear. Nevertheless, lottery and lotto are both gambling. If one did not use his own money and another person did so on his behalf, then that too is haram.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
