  "question": "If a person, who is known to earn money from a haraam source (i.e. gambling, insurance, etc.) donates money for building a medressah or masjid",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Mufti,\n\nPlease clarify for the following:\n\nIf a person, who is known to earn money from a haraam source (i.e. gambling, insurance, etc.) donates money for building a medressah or masjid, then it will be wrong for the masjid comittee to utilize that money.\n\nCan you please outline the rulings on this matter.\n\nMay Allah SWT reward you abundantly for your efforts and raise your status in Jannah.\n\nWas salaam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nIf a person’s complete source of income is from Haram, and he donates such money to a Masjid, it cannot be accepted. If the person has another source of Halal income, and he specifically donates the Halal income then such income may be accepted. If one has two sources of income and did not specify from which source he is making a donation, then his major source of income will be considered. If the major source of income is Halal, his donation will be accepted. If his major source of income is from Haram, his donation will be rejected.  \n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
