  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy question is regarding divorce in Islam, if a person says ?Talaq BismiAllah Inshallah can not never ever be heppend? to himself only, his toung may be moves inside his mouth but there is no voice comes from his mouth not even a single word comes out from his mouth. His lips were tighten closed .Will this statement constitute any kind of divorce ? What should be the volume of tone of voice of pronouncement of divorce, if someone suspect or have wasawas when thinking about divorce that may be he said the word ?talaq? may be his toung moves inside his mouth but there is no voice come out from his mouth and his lips were sealed, will divorce be effective.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTalaaq will only be effective if the husband verbally issues the divorce and his statement is heard and understood by another person.\n\nIf the husband repeats the words of divorce to himself, or utters the word of divorce in such a manner that it is not understood, Talaaq will not take place.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
