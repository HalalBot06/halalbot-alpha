  "answer": "QUESTION\ncan i read salah in a train in a sitting posture? if yes should i repeat it afterwards or is it fullyy valid? some muslims when they go for umra or hajj they buy a quran and leave it in the holy mosques thinking they get reward everytime a person will read that quran. is it rue? did our prophet really say that the person who doesnt visit him after hajj or umra has insulted him?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. If a person leaves his Qur’aan in the Harams of Makkah Mukarramah or Madinah Munawwarah, he will get the reward of every one reciting from that Qur’aan. We do not know if the administration of the two holy Mosques permit donating Qur’aans to the Musjids. It is important to respect the rules of the administration of the Harams of Makkah Mukarramah and Madina Munawwarah.\n\n2. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Whosoever performs Hajj and did not visit me, has done injustice to me.’\n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
