  "question": "What are the rights of Umma on us? And how should we fulfil them?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0AYour question is ambiguous. However, one general right is to convey to the%0D%0AUmmah the message of Allah and His Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta%E3la states that one reason for this Ummah being titled as the best%0D%0Aof Ummah, is the practice of commanding good and preventing evil'.%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) states, 'Whosoever from among you%0D%0Awitnesses evil, he should change it with his hands. And if he is unable to%0D%0Ado so then he should change it with his tongue. And if he is unable to do so%0D%0Awith his tongue, then he should at least consider it to be wrong. And this%0D%0Ais the weakest stage of Imaan. (Mishk%E3t)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Nu%FAmaan bin Basheer (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) says that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) gave an example of people sailing on a boat%0D%0Ahaving an upper deck and a lower deck. The people from the lower deck%0D%0Arequire water and request water from the people of the upper deck. The%0D%0Apeople from the upper deck refuse water so the people from the lower deck%0D%0Adecide to make a hole on the floor of the ship and get water from the sea.%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'If the people from the upper%0D%0Adeck don't stop the people at the bottom from making a hole, the ship will%0D%0Asink and all the people travelling will drown. (Mishk%E3t vol. 2 p. 436)%0D%0A%0D%0ASimilarly, if people do not prohibit evil and sin in the society, the entire%0D%0Asociety - innocent and evil - will equally suffer.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) states that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'Command good and prohibit evil or else Allah will%0D%0Asend such a punishment that will destroy everyone'. (Ibid).%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above quotations of the Qur%E3n and Ahaadith of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam) are clear that commanding good and prohibiting evil is an%0D%0Aemphasised injunction of Allah and His Rasul. Every person must carry out%0D%0Athis injunction. All the Prophets (%C1layhimus salaam) followed the footsteps%0D%0Aof their respective Prophets and after the demise of their Prophet, they%0D%0Acarried out the same mission. The Sahaaba of Rasulullah (Radhiallaahu %C1nhum)%0D%0Aspent their entire lives in commanding good and prohibiting evil. Since%0D%0Athere is no Prophet to come, every Ummati of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam) is the deputy of the Prophet and he has to carry on the mission of%0D%0Athe Prophet. The people of Tabligh Jamaat sacrifice their time, wealth and%0D%0Acomforts to undergo difficulty and hardships to go in the path of Allah - to%0D%0Acarry out this Sunnah of the Prophets - commanding good and prohibiting%0D%0Aevil.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs far as the Tabligh Jamaat is concerned, it is our humble view that they%0D%0Aare acting upon this injunction of Allah Ta%E3la and are fulfilling this%0D%0Aobligation of Shari%E1h. the Jamaat advocates strict adherence to the Sunnah%0D%0Aand confirnes itself within the ambit of the Shari%E1h. The purpose of any%0D%0Aindividual taking part in the Noble work of Tabligh is firstly to reform%0D%0Aoneself and dutifully save mankind from the fire of hell. The overwhelming%0D%0Asuccess of the Jamaat is mainly because of the manifestation of the six%0D%0Apoints which involves the purification of the Naffs and the entity of%0D%0ATawheed.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe word, 'Tashkeel', literally means to form. In the terminology of%0D%0ATabligh, it means to urge the people to give time, to come out in the path%0D%0Aof Allah for self reformation and propagating good for a number of days 3,%0D%0A7, 40, 4 months, 1 year, etc. The number of days is also not compulsory, it%0D%0Ais only recommended just as it is recommended that a person studying first%0D%0Aaid, for example, serves one month as practicals. While he will not be an%0D%0Aexpert in medicine, he will know the basic things to do during an emergency.%0D%0ASimilarly, a person going out for 3 days, 40 days, 4 months, etc. does not%0D%0Abecome an expert on Shari%E1h, but he will learn the basic requirements of%0D%0AShari%E1h. The more time he gives, the more he will learn and perfect himself.%0D%0AThe time frame is not a criteria according to Shari%E1h.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
