  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni would like to know whether it is permissible for us to use lotions containing denat alchol. from what i gather, alchol is a chemical and liqour is haraam.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIn principle, alcohol which is derived from grapes or date extracts are impure. However, if the alcohol is synthetic, it is pure and permissible to use.\n\n\nTherefore, the exact source of the alcohol in the lotions has to be determined. As for denat alcohol, it is a generic term for denatured alcohol. Due to the chemicals/addictives (such as methanol, acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, denatonium, aviation gasoline etc) added, the alcohol looses its potential of intoxicating and is rendered unsuitable for drinking. Thus, it will be permissible to apply lotions containing denat alcohol.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nMl.
