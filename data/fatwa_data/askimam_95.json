  "question": "What is the correct Islamic Ruling on mechanical slaughter (for chickens, etc.)? Is it allowed? If not, why?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like this information to post on my web site, Eat-Halal.com. Jazakallah-hu-Khairan.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMechanical slaughter is of three types: %0D%0A%0D%0A1. Chickens are transported to the place of slaughter through a conveyer belt and are manually slaughtered. If there is%0D%0Acertainty that the chicken is alive and the Muslim slaughterer recites the name of Allah upon slaughtering, then the chicken is Halaal. In this case, only the%0D%0Atransportation is mechanical but the slaughtering is manual. This procedure is unanimously permissible and recommended. %0D%0A%0D%0A2. Chickens are transported by%0D%0Ameans of the conveyer belt to the mechanical slaughter blade. Once the mechanical plant comes into operation, the blade also comes into operation and%0D%0Acuts the chicken. This procedure is not permissible. It does not matter if the plant and the blades are controlled together or separately. %0D%0A%0D%0A3. The chickens are%0D%0Atransported by means of the conveyer belt to many slaughter blades and every blade is controlled separately by a Muslim who recites the name of Allah upon%0D%0Aeffecting the mechanical slaughter. This procedure conforms to the principles of Shar%E9e Zabh set out by the Fuqahaa. According to our knowledge, such a%0D%0Aprocedure does not yet exist.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best %0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0A"
