  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\n \n\nSometimes, some mistakes happen in the Salaat. For Example, I am reading a salaat of 2 Rakaat or 4 Rakaat. After reciting 2nd tashud, I stood up (for 3rd or 5th ) and read the Surah Fatiha ( or in the middle),  I realized that I am praying an extra rakaat. How this can be corrected?\n\nShould I make Sajjda Sahoo after completing the extra rakaat or immediately sit down and recite tashud again and make one salaam and do two Sajjdas.\n\nQ.2 Sometimes, it also happens while reading 4 rakaats, I forget that did I sit down after two rakaats or not and even after thinking, I could not decide on one thing (I am still at yes no). What should I do in this situation?\n\nQ.3 In Bahishti Zewar (Urdu Edition), it is written that bones of Murdar animals are Paak if there is no flesh or fats on it.(of course not of pigs). Does it mean, the bones of the beef which is not slaughtered islamically (like in the west by shooting or electric current) are Paak. I am asking this question because of Beef Gelatin Used in food products like Marsh Mellows. Because gelatin is made from bones. Please Clarify it.\n\nQ.4 I am living in with my family. Few Months back, I bought a piece of land in . My brother told me that the price will increase after sometime. I have no other land before this in my name. At the time of buying and also now, I have no clear intention of buying. What I have in mind is that : \" will see, if I have to build the house and live, will do that, otherwise, I may sell it later on high price and may buy a better plot or etc\".\n\nAfter a month or so, I have to calculate my Zakat. Should this plot be taken into account for the calculation of Zakat?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. As long as a person hasn’t made Sajdah in this added Rakaat, i.e. third Rakaat or fifth Rakaat, he should return to the Tashahhud posture by first making the Sajda-e-Sahw and then completing the Salaat as normal. (Bahishti Zewar pg.187)\n\n2. You should read your Salaat as normal and at the end of the 4th Rakaat, Sajda-e-Sahw will be made to compensate for this assumed omittance.\n\n3. We are researching on gelatine from bones.\n\n4. Since this plot of land was bought for personal usage, i.e. building a house for residing, it will fall under the category of personal needs which is exempted from Zakaat. Therefore, the plot will not be invaluded when calculating Zakaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
