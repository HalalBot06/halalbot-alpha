  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMany banks in pakistan offer loan without interest for HAJ. Is this allow in Islam to take loan from bak without interest and give some of the % before and rest in installemnet after HAJ. If no then why Banks like meezan , dubai islamic offering it.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nProviding loans is highly encouraged. Hadhrat Anas radiyallāhu ῾anhu narrates that Rasullullāh sallallāhu ῾alaihe wasallam said“I saw on the night that I was taken for Isrā’ (Me῾rāj). On the door of Jannat was written: the reward of charity is multiplied ten times and the reward of loan eighteen times. I asked Jibrīl ῾alaihe salām why the lender was given more virtue than the one who gave charity. Jibrīl ῾alaihe salām replied that a beggar begs when he has (at least) something by him while the person asking for a loan, only asks when he is in dire need (in other words he is stranded, therefore helping such a person will earn more reward) ”.[1]\n\n(Sunan Ibn Mājah, pg.175)\n\n \n\nWe are researching the issue of interest free loans from Banks in Pakistan. We will revert to you once after research is finalized.\n\n\n\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\nMl. Abduz Zaman,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  1 عَن أَنَسِ بْنِ مَالِكٍ قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ رَأَيْتُ لَيْلَةَ أُسْرِيَ بِي عَلَى بَابِ الْجَنَّةِ مَكْتُوبًا الصَّدَقَةُ بِعَشْرِ أَمْثَالِهَا وَالْقَرْضُ بِثَمَانِيَةَ عَشَرَ فَقُلْتُ يَا جِبْرِيلُ مَا بَالُ الْقَرْضِ أَفْضَلُ مِنْ الصَّدَقَةِ قَالَ لِأَنَّ السَّائِلَ يَسْأَلُ وَعِنْدَهُ وَالْمُسْتَقْرِضُ لَا يَسْتَقْرِضُ إِلَّا مِنْ حَاجَةٍ(سنن ابن ماجه)"
