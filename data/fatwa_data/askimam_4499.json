Thanks!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer below our standard reply to similar queries.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AI want to know something. I'm 22 years old boy and unmarried. I am suffering%0D%0Afrom bad habit. When I saw girls specially girls with nice looks, I feel%0D%0Asomething in me and that compelled me to masturbate. Well this becomes quite%0D%0Adifficult for me to control myself.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou said in this sort of situation a person should perform \"Nikkah\". But it%0D%0Ais impossible for me to perform \"Nikkah\". Because first I have to complete%0D%0Amy studies than I'll marry. Tell me what really the solution of this%0D%0Aproblem. I am looking for prompt reply from you.%0D%0A%0D%0AWassalaam%0D%0AYour brother%0D%0A%0D%0AAnswer:%0D%0A%0D%0ARespected Brother-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AWa alaykumus salaam%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala has created man with innate carnal desires, and has made Nikah%0D%0Aa lawful and dignified avenue to discharge these desires.%0D%0A%0D%0AUnder normal circumstances, Nikah is Sunnah. If a man's sexual desires reach%0D%0Aa stage where there is a strong fear that he will be involved in Zina%0D%0A(fornication), it will then be Waajib (compulsory) for him to make Nikah. At%0D%0Athis juncture, shyness is no excuse. The man will have to approach his%0D%0Aelders and request them to make arrangements for his Nikah.%0D%0A%0D%0ANikah should not be delayed or avoided for fear of poverty and want. In the%0D%0AAhaadith, we are told that Nikah creates Barakah in one's sustenance. Allah%0D%0ATa'ala has taken it upon himself to assist that person who performs Nikah in%0D%0Aorder to protect his chastity. Nikah is a simple and inexpensive affair in%0D%0AIslam. The errant customs of societies have made it difficult for others.%0D%0AThe solution is to abandon all such customs and conduct the Nikah strictly%0D%0Aaccording to the Sunnah. Nikah, then will not be a burden, rather it will%0D%0Arelease one from a burden.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe next step would be to guard the gaze. It is, thus, imperative to%0D%0Astrictly guard the gaze. Where it is practical, avoid all such situations%0D%0Awhere ones gaze may fall on Ghayr Mahram (women not prohibited in Nikah)%0D%0Afemales. TV, books, magazines, internet, newspapers, should be shunned.%0D%0A%0D%0AShould one's gaze accidentally fall on some woman, immediately lower the%0D%0Agaze. This is not difficult. It only requires some courage and training.%0D%0ASome points that may assist in this are:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Consider that this is not a calamity but rather an opportunity to win a%0D%0Abig prize. It is a once in a life opportunity to strike a huge windfall. In%0D%0Athe Hadith, we are told that a person, who, after having been tempted,%0D%0Alowers his gaze, Allah Ta'ala will grant him the sweetness of Imaan. What%0D%0Amore can one ask for? The one who has the sweetness of Imaan has everything.%0D%0AOthers strive their entire life for this very goal of finding the sweetness%0D%0Aof Imaan. Here is the opportunity to acquire this in a split second.%0D%0ATherefore, lower the gaze and in your heart make this transaction with Allah%0D%0ATa'ala that, 'O Allah! I am lowering my gaze for you. So you grant me your%0D%0Ashare of the deal, i.e. the sweetness of Imaan.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. By maintaining the gaze, one is in fact moving to the depths of Jahannum%0D%0A(hell). And by lowering the gaze, one is ascending the highest ranks of%0D%0AJannah.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Consider the reality of the woman at whom one is gazing. If she does not%0D%0Agroom herself or apply perfume for one day, she will look dreadful and%0D%0Astink. For a number of days every month she has impurity pouring out of her.%0D%0AIf one had to just go near such impurity, one will wish to flee. Imagine if%0D%0Ashe went to the toilet and forget to flush and, if you had to enter the%0D%0Atoilet, will you still have the desire to gaze at her? If this woman does%0D%0Anot have Deen, then by raising her arms and exposing her unsightly armpits,%0D%0Ashe will give out the smell of a skunk. These are some thoughts (although%0D%0Aundignified), will assist one in taming the evil desire to look at women.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Try as far as possible to remain in the state of Wudhu. In the Hadith, we%0D%0Aare informed that Wudhu is the weapon of a Mu'min. With this weapon, it is%0D%0Amuch easier for him to thwart the onslaughts of Shaytaan.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Try to remain in the company of the true friends of Allah Ta'ala. The%0D%0Atrue friends are those that, when you sit with them they remind you of Allah%0D%0ATa'ala and their company produces a desire for the Aakhirah (hereafter). The%0D%0Acompany of such people is extremely effacious in imbuing the obedience of%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala, and in cultivating an abhorrence to sin.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. There must surely be somebody who you have a lot of respect for, e.g.%0D%0Ayour mother, father, grand parents, Ustaadh or Shaykh. Consider if that%0D%0Aperson was present, would you indulge in the evil of masturbating. The very%0D%0Afact that the presence of such a person will deter you is sufficient to show%0D%0Athat you do have the strength to abstain from this evil. When the presence%0D%0Aof such a person will be a cause for controlling one's desires, consider%0D%0Athat fact that the Malaaikah (angels) are with you and are watching.%0D%0AProgress and consider that Allah Ta'ala is watching you. Do you not feel%0D%0Aashamed of His presence whereas you feel ashamed of the presence of a human%0D%0Abeing. Is this the degree of respect that Allah Ta'ala deserves?%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala save you and every Ummati from this evil, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
