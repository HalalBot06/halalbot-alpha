  "question": "What is the ruling to bow infront of a martial arts inspector which forms parts of the training process",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBowing is an act reserved for Allah Ta?ala. Martial arts is not confined to simply physical training. It has a spiritual dimension to it, such as meditation and obedience to the teacher. It can be likened in one way to a religion.\n\nThus, there is all the more reason that one should abstain from this type of bowing, which at times even resembles Sajdah. Try and find a Muslim instructor and explain to him that bowing in this manner is against the teachings of Islam, hence, you will not bow.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
