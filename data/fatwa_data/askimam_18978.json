  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs there a difference between Suni and Tableegh and also why is a muslim not allowed to go for a non-muslim funeral\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh  \n\n \n\nThe Sunnīs and Tablīghīs believe in Prophet Muhammad Sallallāhu ῾alaihe Wasallam as a final Messenger. They also acknowledge and accept the reverence of the Sahābah, Tābi῾īn and ‘Aimmah-e-Mujtahidīn. They are passionate followers of Imām Abū Hanīfah rahimahullāh and accept the authority right up to Mujaddid ‘Alfe Thāni and Shāh ῾Abdul ῾Azīz Muhaddith Dehlwi rahimahumullāh. They also accept that being respectful to the ‘Auliyā (friends) of Allāh Ta῾āla is a means of salvation in both the worlds.\n\nHowever, between these two groups there exist the following differences:\n\na. Was Nabi Sallallāhu ῾alaihe Wasallam Noor (celestial light) or a human being?\n\nb. Was Nabi Sallallāhu ῾alaihe Wasallam knower of the unseen or not?\n\nc. Is our Nabi Sallallāhu ῾alaihe Wasallam all-seeing (Hāzir-o-Nāzir) or not?\n\nd. Was Nabi Sallallāhu ῾alaihe Wasallam Mukhtār-e-Kul, that is did Nabi Sallallāhu ῾alaihe Wasallam had a free will and choice in running the affairs of the universe or it is the sole attribute of Allāh Ta῾āla.\n\nBesides these Masā’il which are related to ῾Aqā’id (beliefs) there are some other differences which are discussed in detail, in the light of Qur’ān and Sunnah by Hadhrat Maulāna Yusuf Ludhyānwi rahimahullāh in his book “Differences in Ummat and the Straight Path” (Pg.43, Zam Zam).\n\nIn short, regarding these Masā’il, that group is on Haq (truth) whose beliefs are in conformity with the Qur’ān Majīd, Sunnah of Rasullullāh Sallallāhu ῾alaihe Wasallam, Practices of the Sahābah radhiyallāhu ῾anhum and the Fiqh of Imām Abū Hanifah rahimahullāh. The other group is in error.\n\n \n\n2.       As Muslims, we are required to express submission to Allāh Ta῾āla and His commands, for this is true ῾Abdiyyat (servitude). We submit to all the orders of Allāh Ta῾āla whether we understand them or not. That is to go beyond ones logic and present oneself helpless before the order of Allāh Ta῾āla. We defy our logic and senses in the presence of Allāh Ta῾āla. Our logic cannot comprehend the wisdom of Allāh Ta῾āla. This is because we firmly believe that Allāh Ta῾āla is Al Hākim (All Wise). Hence we simply submit.\n\nNonetheless, according to Shar῾iah, it is not permissible for a Muslim to attend the funeral        of a non muslim.\n\n(Kifāyatul Mufti, Vol.4, Pg.190, Maktabah Haqqāniyah) [1]\n\nHowever, if the non-muslim deceased is one’s relative, then it is important to show the beauty and tolerance of Islam by offering moral support and expressing one’s condolences. Therefore, one should avoid the actual funeral ceremony by diplomatically excusing one self and continue offering one’s moral support, Inshallāh this kind gesture will sever as an invitation to Islām.\n\n(Khairul Fatāwa, Vol.3, Pg.225, Maktabah Imdādiyyah) [2]\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n\nMl. Abduz Zaman,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā\n\n\n\n\nNB : Although Sunni refers to Ahle sunnah Wal Jamā῾at as oppose to Shi῾as, however, In the ῾urf of South Africa “Sunni” refers to Barailwis, while “Tablighi” refers to “Deobandīs”. Since the Questioner is from South Africa the answer is given based on ῾urf.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1لايجوز لاحد يومن با لله ورسوله واليوم الاخر ان يصلى على كافر او مشرك لان الله تعالى نهى نبيه والمومنين عن الاستغفار للمشركين حيث قال ، ماكان للنبى والذين امنوا ان يستغفروا للمشركين ولو كانوا اولى قربى من بعد ما تبين لهم انهم اصحاب الجحيم . والصلاوة علي الميت هى الدعاء والاستغفارله.
