Jazak-allah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPerhaps your father has reached the age of Arzalul-Umur. It is an age of sensitivity where a person tends to act more childish and immature. Consider his age when dealing with him. Regard him as a Mazoor (excused). Overlook his faults and try to indulge him as far as possible. Respect him and honour him and treat him with kindness and affection. Perhaps he needs your attention and this is the only way he gets your attention.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
