  "question": "I humbly invite your scholars to have a public discussion about Shia'ism with actual Shiah scholars.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu Alaikum, After reading many of the answers to questions about Shia'ism on your website, I was amazed at how far off your scholars are from knowing what the Shiah actually believe and teach. It is one thing to know the surface beliefs and another to know the reasoning and true implications of those beliefs. The only way to learn about the Shiah is to actually talk to Shiah scholars who teach the religion of the Ahlul-Bayt. I could arrange a meeting between your honorable ulema and one or more Shiah ulema so we can have a polite, Islamically conducted public discussion. In this way we can clear up any misconceptions that the two schools might have about each other and also to further our knowledge about the diversity of the Muslim ummah. Also those who have questions about this issue can hear answers firsthand from the religious leaders of both schools. This would be beneficial for all who attend, scholars and students alike. Please email me back as soon as possible. Assalamu Alaikum,\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWa `alaykum as-salam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh%0D%0A%0D%0AThe amazement that the writer of this letter expresses is at the perceived%0D%0Adichotomy between what he is led to think the Shi'ah believe, and what we%0D%0Aglean from studying the most essential Shi'i sources of knowledge. A counter%0D%0Asuggestion should be made to him: that instead of arranging a meeting%0D%0Abetween Shi'i and Sunni 'ulama, he should try to get from the Shi'i 'ulama%0D%0Awith whom he is in contact an explanation as to why there is this apparent%0D%0Adisparity between the picture presented by the Shi'i sources, and the views%0D%0Ahe believes the Shi'ah hold.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe meeting he asks for will, for geographic reasons, not be practical. But%0D%0Awe will be prepared to enter into e-correspondence, as our schedules allow.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn my online experience I have come accross many a zealous Shi'i, or Shi'i%0D%0Asympathiser who labours under the notion that \"if only the 'ulama of the Ahl%0D%0Aas-Sunnah could know what the Shi'ah REALLY believe...\" With sympathisers%0D%0Athis is usually on account of having read one or two books in which Shi'ism%0D%0Aputs its best foot forward, or having listened to an expurgated lecture or%0D%0Atwo. As soon as the realisation dawns upon them that there is much more to%0D%0Ait than what they imagined, the venture of a Sunni-Shi'i \"interfaith\"%0D%0Adialogue fizzles out into non-existence.%0D%0A%0D%0ABe that as it may, I suggest that their bluff be called by accepting the%0D%0Asuggestion, and inviting a Shi'i scholar into an exchange of%0D%0Ae-correspondence. However, the parameters of the discussion must be clearly%0D%0Aspelt out. It will strictly deal with \"misconceptions\" Sunnis alegedly have%0D%0Aabout the Shi'ah. These discussions tend to start with a topic that is%0D%0Ainnocent enough, just to end up back with the Hadith Qirtas, the Ayat%0D%0Aat-Tathir, the Hadith al-Kisa or the mathalib of the Sahabah.%0D%0A%0D%0AWas-salam%0D%0A%0D%0AShaykh Taha Karaan%0D%0A"
