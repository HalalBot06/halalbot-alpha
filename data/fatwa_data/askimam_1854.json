The relationship between you and him is Zina. You should make sincere Tawbah (repent) to Allah Ta?ala and make every effort to change your Haraam relationship into a Halaal one by performing Nikah with the person.%0D%0A%0D%0AKindly refer procedure for performing Nikah.%0D%0AA Nikah is performed with a proposal (Iejaab) by the male or female and acceptance (Qubool) by the male or female in the past and%2For present tense in the presence of two male Muslim witnesses (Hidaaya vol. 2).%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is Sunnat that the marriage be announced and performed in the Masjid and the bride be represented by her Mahram (father, brother, etc.). The bride gives consent to her representative (Wakeel) in the presence of two witnesses to perform her marriage at the Masjid. At the Masjid, the Wakeel represents the bride in the presence of the two witnesses who must be trustworthy and pious male Muslims. They should not be from among the girls ascendants e.g. father, etc. nor from her descendants, e.g. son, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
