  "question": "I would like to know the meaning of mahram. Does this only apply to women travelling for Hajj, Umrah, or in everyday life?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat happens to a widow who has no husband, son, uncles, or brother, but has the finance to go for Hajj/Umrah? Is she not allowed to go or can she go using another male who might not be a relative, as a mahram?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMahram is an Arabic word which means avenue of prohibition. Contextually, it refers to the prohibition of marriage of certain males to certain females, for example, brother to sister, etc. Kindly refer to www.jamiat.org.za/isinfo/mahram.html.\n\nAccording to Shari?ah, it is not permissible for a female to undertake a journey of 88 kms. or more without a Mahram. If a female does not have a Mahram, then she cannot go for Umrah and Hajj.\n\n1. The reference for Mahram is in Surah Nisaa, last page of the forth Juz of the Qur?aan\n\n2. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?It is not permissible for a female to travel without her Mahram for three days.? (Mishkaat vol.1) The Jurists have calculated the journey of three days as 88 kms.\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
