  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni would like to know if idat traspires the time immediately after the talaaq\n\nwhich was 16yrs ago but the talaaq was only confirmed by the moulana it was a talaaq 16ysr ago\n\ndoes one perform idat now or has one already performed\n\nwhether or not they were aware\n\nshukran\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe iddat expired at the time when the talaaq was issued. Therefore the iddat is completed. (Bazzaziyah) (Raddul Muhtar, vol 3, pg 520) (Hidayah 1, pg 425) (Fathul Qadeer, vol 4, pg 154-155).\n\nHowever, one should make Taubah and Istighfaar for not observing the laws of iddat at that time\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
