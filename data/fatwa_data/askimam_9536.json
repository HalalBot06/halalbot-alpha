  "question": "Is it backbiting when journalists report honestly on the sins(crimes) of politicians ? Considering that they are fighting evil by exposing it to the voting populace.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have stopped reading news for it seems to be a distraction and constantly focusses on evil. However, there are journalists who have accepted Islam and now face a very difficult dilemma,that of doing their job andr facing up to all these politicians and criminals on qiyamat for expopsing their sins or quitting their job(finding alternative avenues to practice it). What is the responsibility on a muslim when he holds such an office(that of journalist) and how can he best fulfil this? And if he cannot report on these issues can you give guidance as to how to use these skills please? Thank you (please answer in full) Jazakallo Khairun Ibrahim\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for submitting your question to the institute. Please forgive me for the long delay in responding to your interesting question.%0D%0A%0D%0AOur Muslim brothers who are in the field of journalism should take their responsibility seriously. In fact we need more Muslim journalists all over the world to put across the Ummah's point of view.The world knows at the moment that the 'Media are American' and it has been this way for decades. Whichever medium you care to look at is presently convulsing under the influence and control of the Yanks and the Jewish lobby. You need to just think back on what happened in Afghanistan and in Iraq recently. Journalists were 'embedded' indeed. Rosy reports were being sent out ad nauseam about the progress against the occupied people. The plight of the innocent Iraqi civilians just didn't feature on an effective level in any of the 'embedded' correspondents reports. The same can be said about the first attack on Iraq. The world saw events unfolding with the ears, eyes and hearts of the 'Controllers' of the media. Lets face it, they are masterful at what they do.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis brings me to the important role of Muslim journalists. Al-Jazeera has and is literally being hammered and bombed. Their journalists and camera men are being killed and arrested. The American's have called for the editor's and owners to waterdown their reporting during the invasion of Iraq and when Al-Jazeera did not comply, they were bombed. The Americans and their 'cronies', all over the world wish to control and bring into line other journalists so that only their version of the 'truth' be told. You need only think of what happened to Yvonne Ridley whilst she was a prisoner of the Taliban, and now Taysir Alouni of Al-Jazeera languishes in a Spanish prison with the ultimate accusation of being an Al-Qaaida man.%0D%0A%0D%0ALets face it, the situation in the so-called Muslim countries is pathetic. Their 'leaders' have become compliant idiots and control even the Friday khutbah, to the extent that in Egypt only one khutbah, written up by the authorities will be read out in every mosque throughout the country each Friday.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou will experience censorship and intimidation in this country too. Politicians and certain groups with vested interests will try apply pressure where they can. Your duty is to invite to good and forbid from evil. You are correct when you say that Muslims are guided by the principle of \"hiding the wrong' of a fellow human being. A journalist is however the ears and eyes of society and in that capacity you have certain responsibilities towards your community and to your country. If you know and are aware that certain activities and actions of an individual or individuals are potentially harmful, detrimental, dangerous or can cause harm or destroy social institutions or the orderly functing of society, then it is incumbect upon you to reveal these before harm occurs. Research, check and recheck your 'facts' and verify them before you publish your revelations of a public servant or a criminal. Corrupt public officials have to be brought to book as they are servants of the public and accountable to them.%0D%0A%0D%0AYour sincerity and taqwa are important. Whatever and whoever you report on, remember that you will be accountable to your Creator for your acts of ommission and commission. Observe the journalist's Code of Ethics, remain independent, and maintain honesty. Do not put your integrity and credibility on the line by indulging in sleeze or just to get your article on the first page.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou also need to give voice to the Ummah through your work and your responsibility is great towards the general public. There are numerous journalists who pose as Muslims and take pleasure in 'Muslim or Sullah bashing'. It is important to expose these charlatans. As Muslim journalists, bias against non-Muslim individuals and groups should be avoided. If a Muslim or a group of Muslims are out of line, they must be exposed in no uncertain terms. The general public should be informed that the former's behaviour is not in keeping with Islamic teachings, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0ADuring their Caliphate, Umar and Uthman (radhiallahu anhuma) demanded exacting high standards of integrity, honesty and accountability from their public officials. Those who were found wanting were severely dealt with in public. In fact Abu-Bakr and Umar (radiallahu anhu) made it clear to their subjects that they were public servants and as such could be challenged if found to be deficient in discharging their duties. Status did not matter. Young and old, men and women, rich and poor, literate and illiterate were able to take up this promise without fear. They questioned and challenged the Caliphs to gain clarity and justice. The era of Umar (radiallahu anhu) is known as \"The golden age of Islam\". Do forgive me for this short History lesson. My aim was to point out that the Muslims were at their zenith when honesty, integrity and accountability prevailed. %0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala guide Muslims engaged in every profession and field of work to seek His pleasure and to maintain worthy standards, good character and a code of conduct which will uphold the banner of Islam. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0ASister Fadila%0D%0ASOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
