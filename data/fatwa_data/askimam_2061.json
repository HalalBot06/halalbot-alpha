  "question": "Cutting of women's hair",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaikum I was told that it is permissible for a women to have short hair as long as it comes as far as the shoulders as then it would be imitating a man. I therefore complied with my husband's wish that I should cut my hair to a shorter length. It seems now that I have done wrong.Can you please advise. Also since having children my hair is thinner and does not grow as well therefore would it be permissble to retain it at the length it achieves ie up to the shoulders? May Allah reward you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nARE WOMEN ALLOWED TO CUT THEIR HAIR?%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala created the Human being, individually perfect - with no stigma%0D%0Aof sin and in the best shape.%0D%0AIn Surah Teen Allah Ta'ala declares:%0D%0A%0D%0A'Indeed we have created human beings of the best stature.'(At-tin : 4)%0D%0AEvery part of the human body has been placed respectively to serve its%0D%0Apurpose. Some parts, organs and limbs play an important and vital role%0D%0Awhilst others have a minor supporting role. At the outset, looking at the%0D%0Aexternal human appearance its beauty is manifest immediately and, it's at%0D%0Athis juncture that we are most grateful to Allah Ta'ala.%0D%0AConsequently, we are not owners of ourselves i.e. we have been entrusted by%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala with our physical body and internal self. Therefore, as this is%0D%0Aa Trust (Amaanat), it does not belong to us; and as a result, we have to%0D%0Aobey and respect its obligations. If the Maker requires us to fulfil a%0D%0Acertain requirement, e.g. to cover a portion of the body from the navel to%0D%0Athe knee in the case of men then that law is to be obeyed.%0D%0ASimilarly, a woman is required to keep and wear her hair without cutting it%0D%0Ashort.%0D%0AThis latter issue will be highlighted in the following discourse.%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala has concentrated the physical beauty of the human being in the%0D%0Aupper part of the body, i.e. the face. The face is probably the most%0D%0Aimportant feature in the whole external anatomy of the human being. In fact,%0D%0Aevery effect and reaction becomes evident on the face instantly. Hence, the%0D%0Aface is the central part of the whole body exposed entirely and at all%0D%0Atimes.%0D%0AIt is obvious that, what surrounds the face displays an important value and%0D%0Aforms a protective gear. Moreover, it displays the beauty and identity of a%0D%0Aperson. Therefore, the long hair of the woman professes her beauty, the one%0D%0Amost powerful image of a female.%0D%0ADuring Hajj%2FUmrah, in order to come out of the Ihraam, a man can either make%0D%0AHalq (shave) or Qasr (trim) of the hair on the head. For a woman, she has to%0D%0Aclip the size of the small finger (approximately 2cm.)%0D%0A%3EFrom among the restriction imposed on her during Hajj is (as the text%0D%0Aappears in the Fiqh book, Al-Quduri).%0D%0A%0D%0A'She will not shave but trim'%0D%0A%0D%0A'Because Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu layhi Wasallam) forbade women from shaving%0D%0Abut commanded them to trim (the hair).'%0D%0AThe fact that women are only allowed to trim - a short length (2cm) and not%0D%0Amore - explains the issue under discussion.%0D%0AOnce the wife of Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu layhi Wasallam), Hadhrat Umme%0D%0ASalamah (Radhiyallaahu Anha) asked him, 'O Prophet of Allah, I am a woman%0D%0Awho keeps her hair closely plaited; should I unto it when I wash after%0D%0Asexual defilement?' 'No' he replied, 'It is enough for you to throw three%0D%0Ahandfuls over it (your head)'.%0D%0AIn another Hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu layhi Wasallam) replied to a%0D%0Aquestion saying, 'As regards man, he should undo the hair of his head and%0D%0Awash it until the water reach the roots of the hair. But there is no harm if%0D%0Athe woman does not undo it (her hair) and pours three handful of water over%0D%0Aher head.%0D%0AThese traditions clearly indicate that women are allowed, in exceptional%0D%0Acases, to throw water over their heads - which is not the real matter of%0D%0Adiscussion here - but that:%0D%0Aa) the wife of Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu layhi Wasallam), Umme Salamah%0D%0A(Radhiyallaahu nhaa) herself had long hair;%0D%0ANOTE : The Noble Qur'an refers to them (wives) as the (Mothers of the%0D%0ABelievers)%0D%0Ab) no directive was given to cut, trim, clip, or shave the hair in order to%0D%0Asolve the problem ; and ,%0D%0Ac) in many such questions a similar answer was given.%0D%0AIn one of the most popular books of Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence) Hidaayah,%0D%0Athe text reads:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"It is not necessary for a woman to release her plaits when taking a bath,%0D%0Aif the water reaches the root of her hair.\"%0D%0A4) Sheikh Hafiz says in Fathul Qadeer :%0D%0A%0D%0A\"It is not permissible for men to imitate women in clothing and%0D%0Abeautification that are especially associated with women only (and vice%0D%0Aversa).%0D%0A5) Hadith:%0D%0A%0D%0A'Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaahu nhu) reported that Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu layhi%0D%0AWasallam) cursed the hermaphrodite from the men and the like from the%0D%0Awomen.'%0D%0A6) Hadith;%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaaahu layhi Wasallam) said : Glory (to Allah) who%0D%0Abeautified men by the beard and (similarly) women by their lock of hair.%0D%0A(Takmela e Bahr Raiq vol. 3 p. 331)%0D%0A7) By nature, Allah Ta'ala has distinguished men from women respectively in%0D%0Atheir beauty, e.g. externally the masculine beauty of a man is in the beard%0D%0Aand the feminine beauty of a woman is in her long hair.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is reported from Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaahu nhu) that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaaahu layhi Wasallam) prohibited a woman from shaving her hair.%0D%0AHence, for men to shave the beard is like the women shaving their head.%0D%0A8) In their external features Allah Ta'ala created both sexes differently.%0D%0AFor this and other reasons men are strictly prohibited to imitate women and%0D%0Avice versa.%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaaahu layhi Wasallam) cursed men who imitate women and%0D%0Acursed women who imitate men. (%0D%0A9) Hadith%0D%0A%0D%0AGlory (to Allah) who beautified men by their beard and beautified women by%0D%0Atheir plaits and locks of hair. (Takmela e Bahr Raiq vol. 3 p. 331)%0D%0A%0D%0ANOTE: The above is a hymn read by groups of angels as indicted in the%0D%0Ahadith.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn conclusion, we must remember that our perpetual enemy, Shaitaan, will%0D%0Acause us to deviate from the truth and constantly instruct us to follow his%0D%0Adubious ways. Allah Ta'ala says, \"And surely I (Shaitaan) will most%0D%0Adefinitely deviate them, aspire them and order them;hence they will change%0D%0AAllah's creation.\"(Qur'an 4:119)%0D%0A%0D%0A"
