  "question": "Are you permitted to meet and see the prospective person you decide to marry. Is all the information you get about your future wife purely from sources other than your future wife herself.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is advisable to only see the prospective marriage partner. It is not permissible to communicate with her, even regarding herself. This is the time of Fitnah and evils.\n\nMany boys and girls have entered into Haraam relationships in the pretext of knowing one another for marriage purposes. Many girls and boys have even dumped one another that had devastating effects on them. All this is due to not maintaining the rules and limitations of the Shari?ah. One may enquire about a prospective marriage partner from her family and also make Istikhaara. It is also not possible to know all about the girl through communicating with her before marriage. It often happens that there is an attitude change due to change of relationships. A girl may present herself to be the perfect wife before marriage. Her level of tolerance, etc. may not be a true reflection of herself.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
