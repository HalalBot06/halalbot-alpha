  "question": "What is the muslim view of Jews and the Jewish religion?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAre Muslims supposed to hate Jews? Do Muslims believe that the Torah was given to the Jews- and if yes,what changed?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Qur'aan is replete with the descriptions of the Jews. They have%0D%0Arepeatedly violated the orders of Allah Ta'ala. They are also known to%0D%0Amurder many prophets, in particular, Zakariyyah (Alayhis salaam).%0D%0AThereafter, Allah still bestowed them with a great prophet, Moosa (Alayhis%0D%0Asalaam) who liberated them from the oppression of Fir'awn.%0D%0A%0D%0AThey were instructed by Musa (Alayhis salaam) to fight the nation of Amaliqa%0D%0Aand regain their land. They responded to him, 'You and your Allah go and%0D%0Afight, we will remain seated here.' When they were trapped in a valley for%0D%0Aforty years, Allah Ta'ala bestowed them with food and fruits from heaven but%0D%0Athey said, 'That's not enough, they want other foods.' When Moosa (Alayhis%0D%0Asalaam) went to the mount to speak to Allah, the Jews in his absence,%0D%0Acommitted Shirk and started worshipping a calf. All that in total%0D%0Ainconsideration of Allah's favours upon them.%0D%0A%0D%0AMoosa (Alayhis salaam) predicted to them the coming of Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). That was clearly stated in the Tawrah but%0D%0Athey openly denied that. The above are just a few from an infinite list of%0D%0Atheir disobediences and violations of Allah's orders. Due to their%0D%0Adisobedience, Allah Ta'ala said, 'Disgrace and need has been set on them.'%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Verily this (the Jews) are a%0D%0Adirty nation. We do not need them.'%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
