  "question": "Has Allah Taâ€™ala prohibited haram foods and drinks for disbelievers as well as Muslims? Or is it only prohibited for Muslims?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn an Islamic State (Al-Khilafah), are disbelievers allowed to consume alcohol, pork and other haram foods?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe orders of Allah Ta'ala are not only for the believers but they are also\nfor the non-believers. Similarly, the punishments, warnings and prohibitions\nare also directed towards the disbelievers. This means that if they die\nwithout accepting Islam, they will be punished for not submitting to the\norder of accepting Imaan. However, in an Islamic state, disbelievers will be\nallowed to consume alcohol, pork and other Haraam products.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
