  "question": "1. Could I consider IT Project Management within conventional banking / finance without any involvement with interest? 2.Could you advise some lifestyle change to allow me to pray Fajr without having any major effects on sleep and the ability to wake up in the morning for work?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nQuestion 1:\n\nI have been seeking a new job for the last 2 years, but have been very unsuccessful. I have been continuously applying to earn a Halal living, but I do not seem to be making any progress whatsoever. I have been striving to earn a Halal living by applying for roles with industries that are permissible in Islam. However I have been approached numerous times by recruitment companies who have prospective roles within Banking and Finance (conventional banking, investment banking, life insurance etc). The roles that they have approached me for were the likes of Project Management (i.e. working in the IT or project implementation department of banks / investment banks on various projects). I understand that the services provided by these companies are Haram (interest based), but I would be merely involved in managing and delivering projects as my role sits in a different department of the company.\n\nI find that most of the roles in my profession (Project Management) are within Banking & Finance, but I have been refusing to apply for these roles as I feel that I might be doing Haram or even assisting in Haram. In this age of economic crisis and recession, I feel that I am struggling even more because I am rejecting prospective roles because I am unsure whether it is permissible or not in Islam. I would be very grateful if you could advise on whether I could consider Project Management (or other IT and business roles) within conventional banking / finance, although I would not be having any involvement with interest. I am happy to send you job descriptions of the kind of roles that I have been approached for. Please feel free to email me to discuss this matter further and i am more than happy to clarify anything.\n\nQuestion 2:\n\nI am trying my best to perform my salah everyday, but seem to find it extremely difficult to perform Fajr prayer. I am a light-sleeper and cannot fall back to sleep after waking up for Fajr, and I have to get up for work early in the morning. Is there any advise you could give on how I could change my lifestyle to allow me to pray Fajr without having any major effects on sleep and the ability to wake up in the morning for work? Any specific supplications / du’a for this? Jazakallah Khair\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\n1) You may forward to us your job description for our observations and advise.\n\n2) According to your explanation, we gather that you are not fulfilled with your sleep by fajr time. You also cannot cover up your sleep after fajr. There could be a few possibilities for not being able to wake up fajr time. It is possible that you sleep late and your sleep is not fulfilled by fajr time. In this case you should adjust your schedule and sleep early. Do whatever it takes to make the adjustment. If you know the late nights are the cause of you missing your fajr salaah, the late night activity will be a sin if it is not a necessity. Laziness is also a strong possibility of not waking up on time. The only solution to that is to have courage and exert yourself. Fight your sleep and comfort for the pleasure of Allah. The afterthought of the sacrifice of getting out of the warm and comfortable bed is very comforting in relation to the afterthought and guilt of remaining in the bed and missing fajr salaah.The comfort of the thought of the sacrifice is itself rewarding. The guilt of being in bed is too painful for a believer. You may consider getting a loud irritating alarm clock. Put it on for fajr time and keep it at a distance. When it rings you will have to get out of bed to put it off. Read Laa hawla wala quwwata illa billah and proceed to make wudhu.\n\nYou may also consider telling some of your friends to give you a call fajr time and make sure you pick up the phone.\n\nThese are some measures you may adopt. Finally you your self should fear Allah and to be conscious of His orders and exert yourself to wake up in time for fajr salaah.\n\nIf the president of the country gives you the time at Fajr time to meet him and present your needs before him, will you still remain sleeping at that time? Here it is the King of Kings, Allah Ta’ala granting you the opportunity to engage with him. How can one disregard that opportunity!\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best,\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
