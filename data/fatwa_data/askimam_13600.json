  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDuring salaat I try to focus on the words so to keep my concentration in salaat. But how do IÂ keep my concentration during zuhr and asr salaat praying in jamaat when we are supposed to stand silently?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn order to maintain devotion in the silent Salaah, you may look at the place of Sajda and ponder over the greatness of Allah. Ponder over His Power and His Creation. You may also ponder over the sacrifices of Nabi Muhammed. Inshallah this will maintain your devotion in Salaah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
