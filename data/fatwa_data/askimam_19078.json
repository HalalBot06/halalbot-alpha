  "question": "Is the Education referred by Nabi SAW only regarding religious knowledge?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am now doing MSc, I plan to do PhD insha-Allah. I am looking to carry religious motivation into my worldly education. My question is, Nabi SAW has laid strong emphasis on learning education. Can we also treat our worldly education (my PhD and Academic Research) into the education that is mentioned in these hadiths? or is the Education referred by Nabi SAW only regarding religious knowledge?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nAll the Ahadith that have been mentioned in regards to the virtue of knowledge and the importance of seeking it apply to true Islamic sciences that lead people towards their creator and lead them to complying with His commands and refraining from His prohibitions. These Ahadith do not apply to mere secular sciences and information which at times even lead people away from their creator and the religion of Islam. Despite the fact that the secular sciences are not included under the purport of these Ahadith, if one is firmly grounded in Iman and faith, studying and researching the creation of Allah can strengthen a person’s Iman. This is because Allah has instructed mankind to ponder over His signs within His creation. He states in Surah Baqarah,\n\n\nإِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَاخْتِلَافِ اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ وَالْفُلْكِ الَّتِي تَجْرِي فِي الْبَحْرِ بِمَا يَنْفَعُ النَّاسَ وَمَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مِنْ مَاءٍ فَأَحْيَا بِهِ الْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا وَبَثَّ فِيهَا مِنْ كُلِّ دَابَّةٍ وَتَصْرِيفِ الرِّيَاحِ وَالسَّحَابِ الْمُسَخَّرِ بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ لَآيَاتٍ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ\n\nVerily! In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, and the ships which sail through the sea with that which is of use to mankind, and the water (rain) which Allah sends down from the sky and makes the earth alive therewith after its death, and the moving (living) creatures of all kinds that He has scattered therein, and in the veering of winds and clouds which are held between the sky and the earth, are indeed Ayat (proofs, evidences, signs, etc.) for people of understanding.\n\nWhen one engages in such sciences, he or she should redirect his or her intention towards complying with Allah’s injunction in pondering over His creation. One should reflect upon the might, power and perfection of Allah through His immaculate creation. InshaAllah there will be immense benefit to one’s Iman.\n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMuftī Yusuf Ibn Yaqub\nWashington, DC (USA)\n\n\nConcurred by:\n\nMuftī Abrar Mirza\nChicago, IL (USA)\n\n\nUnder the Supervision of Muftī Ebrahim Desai (South Africa)\n\n \n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER – AskImam.org questions\n\nAskImam.org answers issues pertaining to Sharī’ah.
