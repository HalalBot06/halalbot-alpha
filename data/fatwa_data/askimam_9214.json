  "answer": "QUESTION\nDuring Ihram I visited the bathroom in Jeddah airport for urination and I removed both upper and lower piece of ihram for urination as the bathroom was very dirty. Did I made wrong by removing both pieces of ihram. Can we pray Fajar after having intercourse and before making ghusal.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There is no harm in removing both clothes of Ihraam when relieving oneself and there is no Damm for that.\n\n2. After intimate relations with ones wife, Ghusl (bath) becomes necessary. A person in need of a Fardh bath cannot perform Salaat. Therefore, it is necessary to have a bath before performing Fajr Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
