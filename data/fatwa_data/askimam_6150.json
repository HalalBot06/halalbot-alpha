  "question": "How does one handle a situation in which the husband is a strict hanafi (deobandi) and the wife is a \"moderate\" muslim. wife does not want to wear niqaab, etc.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe wife for eg. does not want to wear niqaab, detests her husband wearing shalwar kameez & sunnah (fist-length) beard. How do you deal with conflicts eg.. Banning music, Western dress for children, banning barbie toys and figurative art etc\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe wife is described as a moderate Muslim. A modern or sinful Muslim would\nhave been an appropriate title.\n\nThe husband should continue advising her and strive to steer her away from\nall avenues of sin. If this fails over a person of time, he may employ\nharsher methods, for e.g. he should refrain from sharing the same bed or he\nmay refuse to eat her cooking, etc. If this fails, he may chastise her as a\nlast resort. However, we suggest he does not beat her in any way but the\nchastisement may take on other forms.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
