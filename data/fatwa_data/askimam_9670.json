  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) Through a wet dream or otherwise, a person soils a bed with semen. the mattress may also have been soiled. do both the bedsheets and the mattress need to be washed, or just the bedsheets? if the incident is not recent and the person does not remember the exact portion of the mattress to be washed, what is to be done then, given that the whole mattress cannot be washed on account of it being spoiled by doing this? 2) when sleeping on a couch, a person woke up to find urine on his pants. the person may have turned during the night, due to which the wet portion of the pants may have come into contact with the sofa. does the sofa become impure? how to puify it, given that it cannot be washed? 3) does anyone who comes into contact with this bed and this sofa become impure? both are dry, the bed and the sofa. and does everywhere this person sit become impure as well? is impurity transmitted in this manner? 4) lastly, how do you arrive at answers to these questions? are you answers based on the quran and sunnah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If the semen soiled the bedsheet and the mattress, and the traces of the impurity are visible on the mattress, then that portion of the bedsheet and the mattress should be washed three times and, where possible, after every every wash it should be squeezed. If squeezing is not possible, for example, mattress, etc. wash once and then wait. When the water stops dripping from it, it should be washed a second time. When the water stops dripping, it should be washed a third time. In this way, it will be purified.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. That portion of the sofa which has been soiled with urine becomes impure and the method of purification is like the mattress.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. If the portion of Sofa which was soiled had become completely dry and a person sits on that place, then his clothes will not become impure. However, if that portion did not become dry and a person comes into contact with it,` then he squeezes his clothes and a drop of urine falls off, then in this case his clothes will become impure.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
