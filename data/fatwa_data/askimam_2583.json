  "question": "Is there such a thing as \"Losing One's Mind\" when doing Ibadah? Is it wrong?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\neg a person losing control of his bodily movements when doing dzikir despite being aware of what he is doing (eg his body sways violently in a complete circle, he is aware he is swaying but he cannot stop it until he ceases his dzikir). The person begins to have a dying thirst and longing for \"something\" and don't seem to know what. What is the ruling of the Fiqh on this? Pls advice and help.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nThe form of Dhikr as explained in the details in your question is generally\ndone by a Saalik (person who undergoes a spiritual training) under the\nsupervision of a qualified spiritual guide.\n\nSuch Dhikr should not be done without the supervision of a qualified\nspiritual guide as it may be detrimental to oneself.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
