  "question": "When a majority of relatives follow customs prohibited by Islam and compel others also, am I allowed to dissociate with them?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI've some relatives who are born Muslims but follow strictly to ethnic practices which are against Islamic teachings also. They also force me to follow as such. If I were to tell them that those are against Islam, their reply will always be that our forefathers did so. Do you think you know more than them? They are adamant in their practices.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two aspects here:\n\nOne is I'elaam (to inform) and the other is I'emaal (to make others\npractice). Informing is merely a means of making others practice. The\npurpose (to make others practice) should be placed first and then wisdom\nshould be applied in trying to achieve the purpose.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
