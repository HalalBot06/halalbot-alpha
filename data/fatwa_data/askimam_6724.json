  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu Alaykum, after marriage, I see my husband miss salat quite often. At times through playing games. This angers me too much. I don't know what to do. I have a son, I am worried My son will get his influence.He hardly prays fajr, because he says he can't wake up. I have tried to Approach to him in different ways about missing salat, but failed. I end up making him angry and cause fitnah. He keeps telling me \"inshaAllah after I come from my 4month jamat, I shall change.\" he is a shura of our area, and I am worried his influence will Fall on the ummat of this place too. I worry Allah will blame me for his salat, as I pray fajr but not wake him up, and that I didn't Make him pray although he is in front of me. I can't wake him up, even if he wakes up, cause I woke him up, he becomes stubborn, and doesn't pray so that I don't get the upper hand. He doesn't want me to talk to him about deen, as he thinks it?s bossing him. I worry Allah's anger is with us and if any calamity was to befall him, I too will fall for it. Sometimes I don't even feel like attending to his duties. I am getting Mental pressure through this. I sometimes feel like running away. Please advise me on what is The right thing to do. I also worry that I might get Allah's wrath when he is angry on me. what should I do Jazakallah Hukhair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou are only responsible to guide and advise. You are not liable to ensure that he physically carried out all his Islamic obligations.\n\nPerhaps your attitude when advising him needs to change. Employ wisdom and tact coupled with love and affection when advising him. Continue with this whilst makind Au?aa for him at the same time as well. The fact that he tells you he will change is an indications of his willingness to change. This in itself is a positive sign. Exercise tolerance with him. Win him over with your love and attention.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
