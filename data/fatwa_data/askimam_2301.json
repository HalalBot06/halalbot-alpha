  "question": "I see things whilst praying?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nFrom about four years ago I have been seeing things whilst praying, such as animals or knives. These things scare me and I usually have to repeat my prayer at least three times. I say surahs before I sleep and after each prayer but it they are still there. I say my prayer aloud in hope that it will stop but it has not, what can I do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDo not be concerned about these visions. These are the tricks of Shaytaan\ntrying to distract you.\n\nThe solution is to ignore these visions and concentrate on the Salaat.\nPonder over the words of Salaat, the postures of Salaat (are they correct),\nand the fact that you are communicating with Allah Ta'ala. If you pay\nattention to these visions, you will be diverting your attention away from\nAllah Ta'ala. This is exactly what Shaytaan wants from you. Do not succumb\nto the wish of the Shaytaan.\n\nContinue making Du'aa to Allah Ta'ala to grant you strength to overcome\nthese trials, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
