  "question": "What if a woman believes in all the fundamentals of christianity, but – like in islam – does not think that Eesa (Jesus) is the sun of God. Are you allowed to marry this woman?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI hope you can help me with the following question. In previous answers I?ve read that it?s possible for a Muslim man to marry a christion woman. The idea behind the permissability of this marriage is that the man might be able to convince the woman of becoming a Muslim. However, in a previous answer, I?ve read that one of the conditions of the marriage is that the woman must believe in all the basic fundamentals of her religion. What if a woman believes in all the fundamentals of christianity, but ? like in islam ? does not think that Eesa (Jesus) is the sun of God. Are you allowed to marry this woman? Clearly she does not believe in all the fundamentals of her religion, but in this aspect of her faith she agrees with the islam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, you should understand that if a person is weak in his faith and there is a strong possibility that by marrying a Christian, his Imaan is at stake, it is Haraam (prohibited) for him to marry a Christian. However, if one is strong in his faith and there is a strong possibility that he will be able to influence the woman to Islam, Shari?ah has granted a leeway for him to marry a Christian.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, there are two issues to consider; a) Permissibility and, b) The Practical aspect. According to the Shari?ah, it may be permissible to marry a Christian, but is essential for one to consider the practical aspect as well. It is a known fact that Christians have certain ideologies, values and ethos which are against the spirit of our Deen. If one is not well acquainted with Deen, there is a strong possibility of him being influenced by his wife and Christianity and thereby renounce Islam.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe, therefore, strongly advise besides it being permissible to marry a Christian, one should seriously consider the practical aspect of such a marriage and furthermore ponder over the consequences it could have on oneself and his children.
