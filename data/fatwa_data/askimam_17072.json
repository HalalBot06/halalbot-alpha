  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs a student I have to attend a 3 day trip to a location 190 kms from home during Ramadan. I want to ask if I have to fast during these days. The trip is with aprox. 40 students, I don't know the exact program yet during these days so I don't know wether it is possible for me to fast. Is it haram not to fast during travel when one actually can fast?\n\nThank you very much in advance, may peace be with you Insh'Allah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n \n\nConsidering the fact that the minimum distance for becoming a Musāfir (Shar‘ī traveler) is 78km and that you will be travelling further than that, it will not be compulsory for you to keep he fast. However, despite this concession, we highly recommend you to try to best to keep the fast due to the immense reward and blessing of the fasts of Ramadān. Although it might be somewhat straining for you, if you can manage to keep the fast, you will be rewarded tremendously. If you speak to the persons in charge of the trip and explain your religious practices, they should understand your situation and assist you in your requirements. If you do not think that you will be able to manage keeping the fast, you can make it up after Ramadān.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
