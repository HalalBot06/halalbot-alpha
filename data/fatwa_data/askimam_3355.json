  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nLunar Eclipse%0D%0A%0D%0AOn Thursday, June 21, 2001, there will be a lunar eclipse. Lunar eclipse is%0D%0Awhen the earth is directly between the sun and the moon, and the earth's%0D%0Ashadow blots out the light of the sun resulting in the darkness of the moon,%0D%0Awhich shines through the reflected light of the sun.%0D%0A%0D%0ANo'maan ibn Bashir (Radhiyallahu unhu) narrates that Rasulullah Sallallahu%0D%0Aalayhi wa Sallam said: The people of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic era) used to%0D%0Asay that the solar and lunar eclipse takes place upon the death of a great%0D%0Aperson. (Mishkaat pg. 131 - Qadimi). Rasulullah Sallallahu alayhi wa Sallam%0D%0Acorrected this misconception and said: Solar and lunar eclipse does not take%0D%0Aplace upon the life or death of any person, but they (solar and lunar%0D%0Aeclipse) are creations from His creation. Allah Ta'ala changes in His%0D%0Acreation whatever He wishes. So whichever of the two (sun or moon) eclipse,%0D%0Aperform Salaah until it (sun or moon) brightens up, or Allah Ta'ala brings%0D%0Aforth a big matter (Qiyaamah). (Ibid.)%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen solar or lunar eclipse takes place,%0D%0A1) It should be regarded as a manifestation of Allah Ta'ala's power.%0D%0A2) Ponder upon the Greatness and Majesty of Allah Ta'ala.%0D%0A3) Fear Qiyaamah (the Day of Judgement) being imminent and make Tauba%0D%0A(repent for one's sins).%0D%0A%0D%0AMasaa-il pertaining to Salaatul Kusoof (Salaah of Lunar eclipse)%0D%0A%0D%0A1) It is Mustahab (desirable) to perform Salaatul Kusoof.%0D%0A2) Salaatul Kusoof is performed individually.%0D%0A3) Salaatul Kusoof may be performed in two rakaats or four rakaats, with one%0D%0Asalaam or two salaams. (Raddul Mukhtaar Vol. 2 Pg. 182, H. M. Saeed)%0D%0A4) One should engage in Ibaadah throughout the eclipse by either performing%0D%0Alengthy Salaah with long Ruku and Sajdah, or by making Dua, or by both%0D%0ASalaah and Dua. (Hidayah Vol. 1 pg. 176 - Multan)%0D%0A5) In Salaatul Kusoof one should recite Surahs wherein Allah Ta'ala%0D%0Adescribes the Day of Qiyaamah (ibid.)%0D%0A%0D%0AE.
