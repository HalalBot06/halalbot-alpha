  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nasalamualykum !\n\ni want to know  difference between lillah ,sadkah and zakat according to hanafi masail.\n\nplease reply me..\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIn brief, zakāh is one of the five pillars of Islām and a means to cleanse one’s wealth.  For those who possess nisāb, it is an obligation to pay 2.5% of their wealth, minus any expenses due, at the end of each lunar year.  Zakāh has to be given in the ownership of needy Muslims who are non-Sayyids (those from the Banī Hāshim lineage). \n\nOn the other hand, sadaqah is any amount of money donated for the pleasure of Allāh and intended for the poor.  However, the term sadaqah also applies to money donated for any noble cause, as well.  It is not necessary to give sadaqah in the ownership of the poor and both, Sayyids and non-Sayyids, are valid recipients of it. \n\nAs for lillāh, it simply means “for [the pleasure of] Allāh.”  It is any good act done with the intention of seeking the pleasure of Allāh Ta’ālā.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
