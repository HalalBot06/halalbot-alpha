  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nSubject: How to determine value of gold jewellery for Zakat payment.\n\n \n\nMy wife possesses gold jewellery. Usually gold jewellery is made up of gold mixed with some other metal e.g. copper. In market, per unit cost of pure gold is different from gold jewellery. One method is that we get weighed the jewellery and estimate the cost using per unit cost of gold jewellery. The second method might be to take the jewellery to a jeweler and get estimated the amount of pure gold used in the jewellery. Then calculate the cost using per unit cost of pure gold.\n\n \n\nWhat is the correct method to determine the value of gold jewellery for Zakat payment? Method 1, 2 or else?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nThe amount of nisāb is 87.48 grams of gold or 612.36 grams of silver. If a person owns gold, silver or cash to the value of the nisāb he will have to give zakāh. The most common practice in South Africa is where the woman take the jewellery to a jeweller and have it weighed. The jeweller will tell you exactly how much of gold one possesses and will even tell you what zakā’at you ought to pay. You should find out the price of gold/silver in Pakistan and calculate it to the above given nisāb.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl. Ebrahim Desai,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
