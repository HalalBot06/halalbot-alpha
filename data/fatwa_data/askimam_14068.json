  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1). Is it permissible to rent a house which has a mortgage outstanding on it? The mortgage is the landlord’s liability; I am intending to just pay rent weekly/monthly to the landlord on top of utility bills. I presume the rent money collected will go towards the mortgage so does this change the circumstances in any way?\n\n \n\n2). Renting is the only option left when one decides not to take out a mortgage; I’d rather rent than partake in Ribaa (interest) as I understand that 1penny of interest alone is laden with sin equivalent to a person having sexual intercourse with his/her mother 53 times. Is this correct?\n\n \n\n3). Are the names Haseeb-Ul-Haq; Qayyum-Ul-Haq and Ty acceptable?\n\n \n\n4). Work uniform requires a man to wear a suit therefore my trousers hang below my ankles; I know this is haraam but I am not allowed to wear a jubbaa unless it is dress-down day whereby employees are able to dress as they wish. Is this excuse acceptable? What would you advise\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1) It is permissible to rent a house that was purchased by the landlord on mortgage. The responsibility of being involved in interest is that of the landlord and not the tenant. Therefore the tenant will not be sinful for making use of the house. However, the tenant should build up a relationship with the landlord and advise him not to be involved in interest as it incurs the wrath of Allah.\n\n2) Your understanding is correct. One penny of haraam is far severe than the worldly benefit one will derive from interest. You may not own a house in the world, but surely you will be living with the pleasure of Allah. Allah puts Barakah in that income that is halaal and pure.\n\n3) Fadila means one who is full of virtue and merit.\n\n4) You should try to keep your trousers above your ankles. The uniform does not compel you to flow your trousers below your ankles. We suggest that you keep your trousers above your ankles and wear the same colour socks as your trousers, so that it does not look odd as the colour scheme will be same.\n\n5) Haseebul Haq and Qayyumul Haq are acceptable names. We do not know what Ty means.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai|"
