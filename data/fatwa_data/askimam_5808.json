  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it permissible to marry someone who believes in any of the following a) Muhammed (sallahu alaihai wasallam) is 'Haazir Naazir'? b) He had complete knowledge of the Unseen c) he was Noor d) those who go to graves and say \"Ya Ghouze-Azam\" etc? If someone is married to a burelvi (who believes in all this), what should be done? Should i refuse to attend my aunt's wedding if she is being married to a biddati? Or there is going to be mix-gathering in the wedding?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two aspects to your query; a) Belief, b) Family relationship\n\na) Belief - Haazir and Naazir and complete knowledge of the unseen are the\nsole qualities of Allah Ta'ala. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was\na human being and his guidance and Sunnah is certainly a source of Noor\n(light) in one's life. If one goes to the grave of the pious and make Du'aa\nto them for assistance, that is Shirk. Du'aa for assistance, is made only to\nAllah Ta'ala. The deceased is unable to help. The evils of the un-Islamic\nbeliefs is further compounded with the evil of mix gatherings.\n\nb) We advise, in view of the close family relationship, you apply wisdom and\nexcuse yourself from not attending the wedding.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
