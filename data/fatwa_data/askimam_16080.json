It is almost natural for you to feel in that way as the medical fraternity is vigorously campaigning for people to maintain a healthy diet and a balanced lifestyle. The negative angle of such a campaign is that people suffering from obesity are ridiculed and mocked by those who are slim and slender. The consequence of their ridicule and mocking has resulted in obese people loosing confidence and self esteem which eventually results to depression and the victim becoming suicidal.\n\nAllah has created us in the best of forms. Allah states “Certainly We have created Insaan (human being) in the best of structures” (Surah Teen Verse 5). Allah has created every person with unique features and qualities. Ponder over the wonderful limbs Allah has blessed you with. Do not be fooled by the commercially motivated anti obesity campaigns and loose hope and courage. These campaigns are also a form of Shaytaans ploy to mislead people from concentrating on religion and issues of their Imaan. Whenever a person performs Salaah, Shaytaan perpetuates this thought resulting in the Musali loosing concentration and devotion. The same applies to the various other acts of Ibaadat (worship) that one may do. Furthermore, you state that due to this frustration you are sometimes tempted to shave off your beard. This is a clear indication of Shaytaan’s effort to lure you into committing the sin of removing the Sunnah beard. You should overcome this physiological battle with Shaytaan by ignoring all his whispers and overpower him by increasing your commitment to Allah.\n\nIf you are overweight we suggest that you contact a medical physician or a dietitian who will assist you in loosing weight and regaining your confidence and self esteem. You should also continue with your Tablighi activities and avoid discussing this issue with others. Make Dua to Allah that he grants you a partner who will be compatibile with you and will assist you in the betterment of your Dunya and Aakirah. Ameen.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
