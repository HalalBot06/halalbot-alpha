  "question": "What does the Quran say about the big bang theory?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nwhat does quraan say about the begging of time or the big bang theory\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nConsider the following verse of the Holy Quran:\n\n \n\nأَوَلَمْ يَرَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا أَنَّ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ كَانَتَا رَتْقًا فَفَتَقْنَاهُمَا وَجَعَلْنَا مِنَ الْمَاءِ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ حَيٍّ أَفَلَا يُؤْمِنُونَ\n\nTranslation:\n\nHave the disbelievers not seen that the heavens and the earth were closed, then We opened them? And We created from water every living thing. Would they yet not believe?  (Quran 21:30)\n\nThe verse may also be translated as:\n\nHave the disbelievers not seen that the heavens and the earth were compact, then We separated them?\n\nIn this case the verse will refer to an event of the early creation, meaning thereby that the heavens and the earth were originally a single body. Thereafter Allah separated the earth from the heavens. The contemporary research about the Big Bang is close to this description. But it should always be kept in mind that the Quranic descriptions are independent of any scientific theory and the Quran should not be made subject to ever-changing theories.\n\n(Ma’aariful Quran vol. 6 pg. 188)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
