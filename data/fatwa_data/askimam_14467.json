  "answer": "QUESTION\nI had a question regarding sending salutations to the Prophet (saw). I've heard non-Barelvi Shayouk say this, and have read this elsewhere in some hadith that I am unable to find. But I wanted to ask what I should make of it.\n\nWhat I read was that on certains days, such as Friday, the Prophet (saw) receives our salutations directly.  There is also a hadith which says that he (saw) is presented our deeds. Can you please explain these two hadith for me.\n\nInvoke blessings on me abundantly every Friday, because blessings of my Ummah are\npresented to me every Friday. And the nearest one to me in rank is one who invokes the\ngreatest number of blessings upon me. [ Ahmad bin Husayn Bayhaqî, as-Sunan-ul-kubra, 3: 249]\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAnas [radhiallaahu anhu] reports that Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘The best of days is the day of Friday (Jumu’ah). Hence, increase the salutations upon me on this day, for indeed, your salutation is presented to me.’ Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhu] asked Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], ‘How will our Salaat be presented to you, when you have become dust?’ Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] announced, ‘Allah has forbidden upon the earth the bodies of the Anbiyaa.’ (Abu Dawud)\n\nThere are angels deputed to convey people’s Salaat and Durood to Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. However, if anyone has to send Durood at the grave of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], then he would hear it directly. If a person sends salaam from a distant place, Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] would not hear it directly, but will be presented with it by means of the angels.\n\nIt is recorded in Musnad al-Bazaar that Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘My living is good for you. Your matters can be discussed and you will be kept informed. My death is good for you, for your deeds are presented before me. Whatever I see from good actions, I praise Allah and whatever I see from evil, I seek Allah’s forgiveness on your behalf.’\n\nThe above Hadith mentioned important points:\n\n1. Deeds are presented before Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam];\n\n2. He praises Allah when anyone from his Ummah does any good deed;\n\n3. Forgiveness is sought on behalf of the wrongdoers.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
