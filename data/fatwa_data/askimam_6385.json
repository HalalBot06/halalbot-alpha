  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt present, the Jihaad in Afghanistan and Palestine is Fardh-e-Kifaayah. If the local Muslims are engaged in Jihaad, the entire Ummah will be absolved.\n\nA Sahaabi (Radhiallaahu Anhu) requested permission from Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) to participate in Jihaad. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) enquired from him if he had parents. The person said, ?Yes?. Upon that, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Go and make Jihaad in them (by assisting them).?\n\nThat was the Fardh-e-Kifaayah Jihaad.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
