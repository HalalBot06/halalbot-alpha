  "answer": "QUESTION\nRecently I had a dream about getting married. I was very happy on the wedding day. At the wedding there were some problems and the wedding had to be pushed up a week and done sooner than anticipated. I was very nervous because I felt I wouldn't be ready on time. I am 26 and most proposals have fallen through for one reason or another. I rarely have good dreams, and this is the first positive dream I have had about getting married. Is this good or bad? JazakhAllah for your response. May Allah reward you for your help.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Good dreams are glad\ntidings.'\n\nMay Allah Ta'ala make your dream come true, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
