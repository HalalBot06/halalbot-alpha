  "question": "Qadhaa prayer and recitation of surahs from memory",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat special intention do I have to give for Qadhaa prayer? Is it permisable to make these prayers up by doing them one at a time as in when I usually pray say fajr I offer 2 rakat Qadhaa prayer then 2 rakaat sunnah. and do so the rest of the day and so on? As in I offer the Qadhaa prayer before I offer the real prayer for the day on time If one accidentally breaks someone elses statue (in their house) does one get reward for it since statues and such are not good to keep? How do I add two surahs together during prayer e.g. if I want to pray surrah al-kafiroon and surah maun in one rakat. If one starts the prayer in just the right time but ends it after the prayer time does the prayer count as late or on time? Am I allowed to recite surrahs when I'm in bed and do not have correct atire i.e. shorts and shirt? Am I allowed to recite surrahs while walking down the street (whishpering or in low voice) or running (in my head) Am I allowed to recite surrahs (from memmory) without having Wudu (but having gushl)?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There is no fixed time for offering a missed Salaat, one may offer it at%0D%0Aany time as long as it is not during the forbidden times for Salaat, i.e.%0D%0Asunrise, midday and sunset.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf a person has missed over months and years of Salaat, he should determine%0D%0Athe number, even by estimation, and then start offering them accordingly,%0D%0Anaming the Salaat missed in the intention. One should stipulate in the%0D%0ANiyyat (intention) when making the Qadhaa which Salaat is being made. For%0D%0Aexample, 'I am making Qadhaa of Fajr Salaat.' (Ahsanul Fataawa vol.4 pg.17).%0D%0AIf the intention is not stipulated, the Qadhaa will not be valid. One may%0D%0Agive preference to Qadhaa Salaat in relation to Nafl Salaats. The manner%0D%0Aexplained by you is appropriate.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf the sun rises while performing Fajr Salaat, the Salaat will be nullified%0D%0Aand one has to offer Qadhaa of Fajr Salaat after the sun has completely%0D%0Arises.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. In Salaat, a person may add as many Surahs as he wishes but Surahs should%0D%0Abe recited in the same order as in the Qur'aan. For example, a person%0D%0Arecites Surah al-Kaafiroon and Surah an-Naas in the first Rakaat, in the%0D%0Asecond Rakaat he should recite Surah Lahab, Surah Ikhlaas or Surah al-Falaq.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. It is permissible for a person in the state of Wudhu to recite the Qur'%0D%0Aaan. It is not permissible for a person on whom Ghusl is compulsory to%0D%0Arecite the Qur'aan at all even from memory.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. It will be permissible to recite the Qur'aan while walking and running.%0D%0AOne may recite the Qur'aan in a loud voice as long as it does not disturb%0D%0Aothers.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. The Satr of a male is from his navel to below his knees. This part of the%0D%0Abody must be covered at all time. Whether in public or in the bedroom. One%0D%0Awho is devoid of reverence misses Allah's special favours.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe essence of all the rules of reverence is to consider the Glorious Qur'%0D%0Aaan as the words of Almighty Allah Ta'ala, Whom we Worship, the one whom we%0D%0Alove and seek. Those who have ever experienced love, know how worthy of%0D%0Aadoration is a letter or speech of the beloved.%0D%0A%0D%0ALove itself will teach one the rules of conduct in love. Let us make Du'aa%0D%0Ato Allah Ta'ala that he makes it possible for us to recite the noble Qur'aan%0D%0Aat all times and the rules of Tajweed whereby gaining his pleasure, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. Your question is not clear. However, if something is done accidentally ,%0D%0Ahow can a person receive reward.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
