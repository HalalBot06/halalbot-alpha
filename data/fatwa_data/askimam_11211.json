  "question": "My mother passed away 1.5 years ago and she seldoms comes to my dreams in relation to the rest of the family. Why? Has she forgotten me or has she stopped loving me?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDreams are not in our control or in the control of the deceased. It is the Will of Allah.\n\nNo deceased comes in one?s dream by his/her own wish. There is no reason for you to feel grief for not seeing your mother in your dream. You should perform acts of virtue, for example, recite the Qur?aan, perform Nafl Salaat, offer charity and make the intention of giving the reward to your mother. Be rest assured that she is receiving your reward and loves you very much.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
