  "question": "I have shares in Old Mutual / Sanlam :1.Are these shares halaal or haraam? 2.If I sell them are the proceeds halaal or halaam?3.The dividends that I have received are they halaal or haraam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe shares were acquired when the companies demutulized\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAny form of life insurance is Haraam. Mutual companies are owned by policy\nholders and all reserves are built up through retained profits. However,\nsuch profits primarily arise from income generated through Haraam\ninvestments such as interest on government stock, interest on fixed deposit,\ninvestments, investments on Brewery companies, etc.\n\nAccordingly such accumulated profits are from Haraam sources. On\ndemutualisation, these accumulated profits are utilised to issue free shares\nto policy holders in proportion to their equitable shares. Therefore, such\nshares received are Haraam and the proceeds on sales are Haraam. The\nproceeds should be given away as charity to the poor and needy.
