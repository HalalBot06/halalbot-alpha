  "question": "Is it permissible for me to ask my parents for money?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI really wish to be an actress but sadly i never ever get any roles in anything. so i have decided to have a filmmaking business in which i can fulfill my dreams, and cast out the jerks who have snubbed me and make them jealous. this will be called devashi films, i wish my parents finance it? it it ok for me to convince me. and i dont mind if its haram or not. i am truly devastated,sir. i hope you can see this.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour pursuit of Haraam (i.e. the film industry) will only fuel your\ndevastation. Your depression will only worsen the further you move away from\nDeen. Why don't you steer your dreams in the right direction?\n\nPursue an Islamically legitimate form of business and then, by all means,\nyou may approach your parents for a loan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
