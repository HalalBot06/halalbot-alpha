  "answer": "QUESTION\nDoes one have to recite it when praying Witr with Jamaat? Would it also be possible to provide the Hadith that supports the Shafii way (2+1 rakaat) of performing Witr?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There are many Ahaadith that support the Hanafi method of Witr, for%0D%0Aexample, Hadhrat Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to perform 3 Rakats of Witr, and would%0D%0Aonly make Salam at the end.' (I'elaa-us-Sunan vol.6 pg.30; Karachi)%0D%0A2. Witr Salaat: To perform the Witr Salaat is compulsory. The first and%0D%0Asecond Rakaat of a Witr Salaat is performed in the same manner as the first%0D%0Aand second Rakaat of a Fardh Salaat. But in the third Rakaat of the Witr,%0D%0Aafter reciting Surah Faatiha and a Surah or some verses of the Qur'aan, the%0D%0AMusallee utters, 'Allaahu Akbar' and simultaneously raises both hands in the%0D%0Ausual manner just below the navel. The Musallee now recites Du'aa-e-Qunoot,%0D%0Aand after the Qunoot he goes into Ruku and completes the Salaat in the%0D%0Anormal manner.%0D%0A3. Du'aa-e-Qunoot Translit: Allaahumma innaa nasta'eenuka wa nastaghfiruka%0D%0Awan u-uminu bika wa natawakkal alayka wa nuthniy alaykal khayr wa nashkuruka%0D%0Awalaa nakfuruka wa nakhala'a wa natruk man yafjuruka. Allaahumma iyyaaka na'%0D%0Aabudu wa laka nusalliy wa nasjudu wa ilayka nas'aa wa nahfidu wa narjuw%0D%0Arahmataka wa nakhshaa 'adhaabaha, inna 'adhaabaka bil kuffaar mulhiq.%0D%0A(Trans: O Allah! We besech Your help and we ask Your pardon and we believe%0D%0Ain You and we put our trust in You and we praise You in the best manner and%0D%0Awe thank You and we are not ungrateful to You, and we cast off and leave one%0D%0Awho disobeys You. O Allah! You alone do we serve and to You alone do we pray%0D%0Aand we prostrate and to You do we flee and we are quick in doing so and we%0D%0Ahope for Your mercy and fear Your punishment. Without a doubt You punishment%0D%0Awill overtake the unbelievers)%0D%0A4. One has to recite the Qunoot when making Witr in Jamaat.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Imraan Vawda%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
