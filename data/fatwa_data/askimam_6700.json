You don't need a Du'aa to determine what you like. You very well know\nwhat you like. So, your question seems vague. Look for a woman who you feel\ninclined to but give preference to piety over all other factors.\n2. Haarith means, 'one who tills the land'. The name signifies a person who\ntills the land of this world and hopes to reap the fruit (reward) of the\nhereafter. It is a good name.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
