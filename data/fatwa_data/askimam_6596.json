  "question": "1) wearing taweez? if I wear taweez and go toilet is it not impure as taweez contain ayats from Quran. 2) I urine and donâ€™t find water, etc. reach home, wash my parts. Do I have to change my cloths?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. With reference to your answer for Q.No:6550, you said taweez is permissible in Islam. You have explained me about reciting Quran ayaths and blowing into water or body parts (the parts to be cured, for eg head, hand etc). But how about wearing taweez? Suppose if I wear a taweez and goto toilet is it not impure as taweez contains ayaths from Holy Quran. Also my body may be impure at many times (eg, while sleeping). 2. Suppose if I go for urine and I don?t find water or stone or paper etc. Later reaching home I?m washing my parts. Now, how about my prayer? Do I have to change my cloths? Do I have to take bath? Because sometimes in my office when I go for urine some drops fall into my pants. I used wash that place by water. Then I used to go for prayer. Is it ok? May the Almighty bless you and your team with good health and long life, ameen.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. A Taweez contains Aayaats of the noble Qur'aan. It deserves a great\namount of respect. You should refrain as far as possible from wearing such\nin the toilet and times of impurity. However, if the Taweez is of such a\nnature that it has to remain on you all the time and you have been advised\nto do so, then you may keep it on you properly wrapped up and covered.\n2. One should exercise great precaution in the matters of urine. Nabi\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Exercise caution in the matter of urine\nfor verily a great amount of punishment of grave is attained through it.'\nThe best and most preferred method is to use water and stone or paper. This\nwill alleviate and remove all doubts.\nIf you had urinated and then only later on washed yourself, then it is\nnecessary for you to ensure that your clothes and body is pure before you\nperform Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
