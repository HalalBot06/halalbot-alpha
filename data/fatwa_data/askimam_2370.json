  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalaamu alaikum. In reference to a question answered regarding Jihaad in the Middle East compared to Afghanistan, you stated that the Taliban defeated the Russion communists. The 'Taliban' are a very new group and it was the Mujahideen who fought in the name of Allah (swt) and prevented the Communist takeover. Please clarify the role of the 'Taliban', who seem to be an external force of Pakistani supported intruders with an active role in increased bloodshed in Afghanistan.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe disagree with you. The Taliban government is made up of ministers who actually participated in the Jihaad against Russia.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
