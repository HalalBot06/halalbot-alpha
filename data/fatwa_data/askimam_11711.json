  "question": "Is it haram to marry someone who you know has had sexual intercourse before marriage, but they now regret it, have repented for it and are a better person?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI?ve never had a boyfriend,and have always maintained my chastity for Islamic reasons. However, recently I have met this guy that I like,and I want to introduce him to my parents. But he has in the past had sexual intercourse with another girl.I know this is fortification, & I don?t know whether to consider him anymore for marriage according to Islamic law. He regrets what he?s done, has repented for it, and is trying to change to be a better Muslim ie he is more focused on what is right and wrong according to Islamic law then he was in the past. However, I?ve heard in Islam the sin for fortification can only be repented for if you are lashed. Is that true? I still want to bring him home to my parents as I think he will make a good husband InsahAllah. But I?m worried if I accept this man for marriage, then it may be my sin as well: ie my sin for accepting someone who has committed sexual intercourse before marriage.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMasha Allah it is excellent that you maintained your chastity. Read Sura\nNisa re: An adulterer marrying an adulteress. So sister what is the reason\nto suddenly fall for someone who makes promises. It happened what if the\npossibility of happening again?\n\nNevertheless when one is in search of a good marriage partner look for deen\nin his life, his attitude to parents/family/friends. His dealing with\npeople, the type of friends he keeps, his compatibility level with you not\njust being wooed by an exterior short outlook. One only discovers the true\nnature of a person when living or travelling with them. Then also make\nIstikhaara ask your parents to make Istikhaara. This is important your\nfeelings thereafter if you are unsure be careful.\n\nMay Allah Ta'ala guide you.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n2SOCIAL DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
