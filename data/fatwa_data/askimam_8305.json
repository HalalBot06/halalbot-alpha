  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer below our standard reply to similar queries.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AQ: Is it permissible to engage in a cyber-cafe (Internet Cafe) business? Internet has advantages and disadvantages. Some of the disadvantages are young girls and boys do online chatting with strangers and also go on pornographic sites. There are also other un-Islamic entertainments in the cyber cafe, for example, music, etc.%0D%0AA: Cyber caf%E9 business is analogous to the sale of a radio which may have permissible and prohibited programmes. In principle, it is permissible to sell any item that has dual or multiple purposes, some of which are permissible and others prohibited. The responsibility of the abuse will rest on the purchaser and not on the seller. However, if the service provider is certain that the cyber caf%E9 will be abused, for example, communicating with the opposite gender, checking pornographic sites, etc., then it is not permissible to offer this service to such a person. It may not be possible or practical to restrict the use of a cyber caf%E9 to any person, therefore, if one is certain that his clients will abuse the facility, it is Makrooh to engage in such a business as that will be assisting in sin."
