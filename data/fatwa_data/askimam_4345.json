  "question": "After Fajr, no matter how hard I plan to stay up and memorize Qur?an, sleep takes control, and I get up after couple of hours and offer Ishraq. What?s the best way to solve this problem?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWould I still get the same reward for Ishraq as compared to staying up?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIshraaq salaah is performed at approximately 20 minutes after sunrise. We\nadvise you perform your Fajr salaah just before sunrise and engage in any\nact that may keep you awake till Ishraaq time and thereafter fulfil your\nsleep. If the reason for feeling sleepy is sleeping late at night, then you\nshould also make adjustments in that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT"
