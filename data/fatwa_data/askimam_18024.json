  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalaamu Alaikum\n\nI have a query that I need urgent help with.\n\nI do not have a specific habit for haidh. It is so irregular that sometime I get bleeding less than 7 days while other times it goes on for more than 14 days. For quite sometime I am trying to keep up with the counting of haidh and istihadha, but  I do not know whether I should count 10 days as my habit or change it to less then that for the couple of months that i bleed less. Then sometime my tuhr is less than 15 days as well, making dam matawali. in those months i resort to the ruling of 10 day haidh and 20 tuhr.\n\nIn the last 3 months, it has become extremely confusing. because of all the irregularities i have lost the count of bleeding days and others. I seek you guidance how to establish the habit and what to do with the salaah for the days i might have missed under the impression that I am under haidh?\n\nWassalaamu Alaikum\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIn order for us to answer your question, we kindly request some sort of pattern for your bleeding. Some dates or anything that you may have recorded would help. Kindly reply us so that we may answer as soon as possible.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
