  "answer": "QUESTION\ni'm 17 years old, and im having a lot of health problems. For about 6 years i've been ill, i've been diagnosed with serveral deseases, i've had 3 sugerys, brain surgury, back surgury and stomach surgury. I'm a very week person i can't stand up to pray salat, i sit on a chair, and i can't go down in sijdah because of my head problems. I've also been diagnosed with a ovarian desease, my body does not allow me to have a monthly cycle. I'm always sick, so i can never fast. I also can't eat any food because of my sickness, i only eat one piece of bread everyday. I get very upset and depressed, i always try to remember the sufferings that the prophets and sahabas went through, but recently im just so sad, i dont know what to make dua for anymore, sometimes i just want to ask allah to take me back to him so i can no longer be in pain and suffering. Can you please advice me some duahs that might make me feel better? Im also unable to sleep, i cant seem to fall asleep anymore. please help me. jazakala\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou hold a very lofty position in the sight of Allah. May I request you to make Du?aa for me. Your Du?aas will be very beneficial for me. If I benefit by your Du?aas, you will be greatly rewarded for whatever good I may do.\n\nThere is no reason for you to be sad and hope for death. Your condition invokes the mercy of Allah and your Du?aas for people are accepted. Why would you prefer death if you are an asset for people and a means of invoking Allah?s mercy of earth? You are better off than people with good health, but all that is disguised in your ill-health. Be sure, you are a very valuable person and I once again request you to always make Du?aa for me.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
