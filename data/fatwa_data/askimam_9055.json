  "question": "1) When making up qadhaa prayers is the missed Jummuah salah be made up with 4 fard from Dhur salah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n2) As a follower of the Imam Hanafi madhab please can you advise of some books I can purchase regarding the Imam Hanafi madhab. I have seen a book called THE HEDAYA and this is an excellent book however it does not cover topics such as Salah,Fasting etc. The book generally concentrates on Zakat, Marriage, Divorce, Sales etc. Someone recommended a book called Reliance of the Traveller (although it cocentrates on the Imam Shafi madhab it compares the Imam Shafi madhab with other madhabs) would this be a good book although I follow the Imam Hanafi madhab. 3) Please can you advise why it is not permissable for muslim men to wear a silver chain. 4) I have been advised that eating non halal meat of any animal beside a pig is makruh and not haraam. The only haraam animal is a pig. Please can you advise the ruling on this as my beliefs are that if an animal is not slaugherted in the traditional Islamic manner then it is haraam regardless of the animal being a lamb, sheep or a pig. 5) Please can you advise why some Shia muslim are regarded as non muslims although they believe in the first kalima. My understanding is to be a muslim you must believe in the first kalima. I know that some Shia muslim have very different beliefs to the Ahlus sunnah Wal Jamaa however they still believe in the first kalima; which I thought means you are muslim. Please forgive me if this seems a simple question.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If one missed Jumu?ah Salaat, he must make up for it by performing four Rakaats of Dhuhr Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. We suggest reading Bahishti Zewar (Heavenly Ornaments), Moulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi (RA). A copy of Bahishti Zewar is a must for every household.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Hudhayfa (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?(the use of) Gold and silver is for the non-believers in this world and for the believers in the Aakhirah.? (Bukhari Hadith5831)%0D%0A%0D%0A4. The advice given to you is incorrect. The meat of any animal not slaughtered according to Islamic rights is Haraam. It is equivalent to a pig.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Belief in the first Kalimah ? the oneness of Allah is not the only requirement for a person to be a Muslim. A Muslim must believe in all the prophets and in particular the finality of the prophethood of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), he must believe in the Qur?aan, the angels Jannat (paradise), Jahannum (hell), the Ahaadith and teachings of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), life after death. There are different sects of Shi?as, each having different beliefs. Some Shi?ashave beliefs that are inconsistent with Islam and hence such Shi?as are non-Muslims. Other Shi?as have beliefs that are incorrect but do not render them as non-Muslims. A general ruling cannot be given regarding all Shi?as.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
