  "answer": "QUESTION\nDoes this mean that, it is permissible for a Hanafi to pray his Asr salah before Hanafi Asr salath time sets in but with in the Asr salath time of Shafi (Which starts about an hour before the Hanafi time).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Hanafi scholars have difference of opinion on the terminating time of\nDhuhr and commencing time of Asr. Many hold the same view as Imaam Shaaf'ee\n(RA). Therefore, in a normal situation a Hanafi should perform his Asr\nSalaat after the shadow of any item reaches twice its size excluding the\nsize of the shadow during midday. That is the terminating time of Dhuhr and\ncommencing time for Asr according to Imaam Abu Hanifa. However, in\ncircumstances, for example, Safar, etc. the Imaam being a Shaaf'ee, etc. a\nHanafi may perform his Asr Salaat during the Shaaf'ee time as that is the\nopinion of many Hanafi jurists as well, in particular the students of Imaam\nAbu Hanifa, Imaam Abu Yusuf and Imaam Muhammad.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
