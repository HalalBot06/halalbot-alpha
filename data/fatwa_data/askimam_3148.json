  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0AThere are two aspects here, one celebrating the ten year anniversary and the%0D%0Aother having a Jalsa. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said,%0D%0A'Whosoever imitates a nation is from among them.'%0D%0A%0D%0ACelebrating an anniversary, for, example, wedding, project, etc. is a common%0D%0Aand salient practice of the Kuffaar. As Muslims, we should distance%0D%0Aourselves from every practice commonly practised and attributed to the%0D%0AKuffaar. As regards having a Jalsa, since it is in the context of%0D%0Acelebrating a ten year anniversary, it will have no Deeni benefit as is the%0D%0Apurpose in general Jalsas.%0D%0A%0D%0AFurthermore, such celebrations have many negative factors that is%0D%0Adetrimental to one's spirituality. It creates I'ejaab (ostentatiousness) in%0D%0Aone. Rather, Du'aa should be made to Allah to accept the efforts of the past%0D%0Aand seek forgiveness for the shortcomings. We will celebrate only in Jannah%0D%0Awhen Allah Ta'ala will announce the acceptance of our deeds and grant us His%0D%0Apleasure. Following the ways of the Kuffaar deprives us from the mercy and%0D%0Aassistance of Allah Ta'ala.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
