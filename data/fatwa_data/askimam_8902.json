  "answer": "QUESTION\nAm 24 years old guy student at USA. The problem is in my life. I never success in any thing I do big or small. Now it worst. I get sick and before I get well from illness I get new problem in my health now am having back problem and I will have to do surgery and the doctors said it is very strange this problem I have because it comes to old people and am 24. In six months I lost my job and I can't find any, health and school because of my health. I would say my God punish me but no way because I never did something unlawful. And I never hurt any body and I always help people around me when I can. And I would say my God examine me but God don't destroy people and the strange thing here all my friends that do every thing bad God hate and they live batter life than me. Some people told me that am begrudged and I think that someone mad AMAL(black magic) to me because it not normal what is going on to me. No one from my family has this problem. When I had 17 years. Old woman told me am begrudged after reading Quran on me she was gaping a lot and having hard time reading Quran on me and she didn't say this to any one from my mothers sisters sons and my mother having hard time reading Quran on me. She keeps gaping and her eyes tern red and watering. In the a few days a go my little sister t had a dream that she saw me sleeping and someone looking at me and begrudging me. What do you think of this? Do what my other friends doMaybe they are right and am wrong\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for the question which you have submitted to the institute.%0D%0A%0D%0AI would like to point out to you that Allah Ta'ala has given you ten fingers and they are all not the same size, thickness, shape and strength. Most probably your facial features are not symmetrical, you may find that your limbs are not symmetrical either. Likewise, Allah Ta'ala has placed human beings in this world who are of different races, creed, colour, hair texture, language, religion, nationality etc. If you look further, you will note that more than three quarters of the world's population are living below the poverty line, with little access to fresh water, food, and natural resources. Take it one step further and you find that these people do not have access to proper health care and that in most of these areas health care services are totally lacking. Few of them have adequate housing, education or opportunities to improve their lot. Go hundreds of leaps further and you find that some people are so rich that they could feed all those poor people for a whole year and it won't make a dent on their wealth.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala has given each human being different gifts and shortcomings. Some are blessed with exceptional memories to the extent that they memorize the whole Quran and thousands of Hadith and much more without any difficulty. Some have excellent intellectual abilities and they invent, create and excel in the most intellectually challenging tasks with the greatest of ease. Some have a tremendous ability to endure physical pain and discomfort. They accept it all with a great deal of sabr. Some people are physically unattractive and yet they are thankful to their Creator for they think things could have been worse. Some people are born without an adequate immune system that they have to live their short life in a bubble where they can have no human contact. Some people meet with calamity after calamity and still go down onto their prayer mat and thank Allah Ta'ala for HIS blessings, rahma and love.%0D%0A%0D%0ABrother, where do you think you fit in Allah Ta'ala's plans? Do you really think that Allah Ta'ala didn't have plans for you too? You have heard of the Prophet, Ayoob (Alayhis salaam). He was the one man who lost his whole family, all his wealth and belongings and his servants in a calamity. He went down on his knees in sajdah and thanked Allah Ta'ala. Later he had the most unsightly and nasty skin disease where maggots were crawling out of his sores and feeding on his skin. Did he complain and think he was being punished? No, he did not. Instead, if a worm fell off from where it was feeding, he would pick it up and let it feed again. As far as he was concerned Allah Ta'ala had placed that worm's nourishment right there, on his skin and he was satisfied with Allah Ta'ala's will. He thanked Allah Ta'ala for this affliction. He often thanked his Creator by going down in Sajda. Later, Ayoob (AS's) skin condition improved, Allah Ta'ala restored his wealth and health to him. This Prophet is an example to us as to what sabr and gratitude can achieve. Our own Nabi (salallaahu alayhi wassallam) suffered a great deal of torment, hardship and loss with sabr just so that Deen could come into our lives. We should accept that all good and bad comes from Allah Ta'ala. We should not ask for calamity or difficulties. However, when these come to us, we should bear them with sabr and seek Allah Ta'ala's pleasure by asking for HIS assistance in overcoming that calamity. How do we seek from Allah Ta'ala? By resorting to increased dua, salaah and zikr, giving sadqa in abundance, obeying HIS commandments, fulfilling our duties as HIS obedient servants and in making sabr.%0D%0A%0D%0AMy suggestion to you is to consider how fortunate you are. You have some difficulties but you have remained steadfast. You have avoided sinning as your more (bodily) healthy friends sin. But are they really healthy or are you healthier than them? Would you really like to incur Allah Ta'ala's wrath by being as ungrateful as they are? You are actually aware that they sin and do as they please although they have \"everything\". Imagine, you have little, you struggle, you get sick, you lose your job, you struggle, but YOU ARE CLOSER TO ALLAH TA'ALA. You may not realize it at the moment, you have much more than the sinners. You have a clean life! Are you really prepared to swoop places with the sinners? Would you really like to have the ease and comfort of this world which will last for a short while only? Or would you prefer to sacrifice the temporary pleasures if this filthy world to enjoy your Creator's promises of the hereafter? Allah Tamale has promised everlasting joy to those who obey and abstain from sin in this world.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou strike me as an intelligent person. Let an Aalim help you with the spiritual difficulties you have and carry out the amal he prescribes for you. Put your complete and total faith in Allah Ta'ala only. As far as employment is concerned, try to upgrade your qualifications by studying further via correspondence courses if that is what will suffice for you at the moment. Make the extra effort with Allah Ta'ala's guidance to do the best you can. Don't loose faith and courage. Believe that with Allah Ta'ala's help you can achieve what you set out to do. You can only be defeated if you give up. This will make shaitaan happy. Keep up your faith firm and ask Allah Ta'ala for help daily.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala guide you and protect you from shaitaan's whisperings and plans. Ameen.
