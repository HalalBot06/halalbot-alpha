  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Brother In Islam.assalamualaikum.my cousin got Nikah'd to a girl in Pakistan in June 1998. Then the rukhsatitook place in April 2001. The girl came to the U.S to live with him. Now heclaims the girl isn't his type and wants to divorce her and marry an americangirl (she's going to convert insha'Allah) my question is..should the marriagebe tried to salvaged or should the family let him go ahead with the divorce.please reply soon insha'Allahwassalam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNikah is a sacred bond. Among many virtues of Nikah, one is that Nikah is a%0D%0Ameans of an extended family. In view of major implications of a Nikah, the%0D%0Aconsequences of a divorce are equally grave.%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'The most%0D%0Adetestable thing in the sight of Allah is Talaaq.' Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) also said that the Shaytaan is most pleased when there is a%0D%0Aseparation between the husband and wife.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen one searches for a marriage partner, his purpose ought to be to choose%0D%0Aa life partner, to share with one another everything in life, happiness,%0D%0Agrief, etc. Compatibility as well as suitability between the husband and%0D%0Awife is of paramount importance. It is for that reason, Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised that the boy and girl see one another%0D%0Abefore marriage. If there is no compatibility between the spouses, for%0D%0Awhatever reason, it is irresponsible to proceed with the Nikah and%0D%0Asubsequently break it. That attitude may have a permanent and devastating%0D%0Aeffect on the girl. It also leads to having a bad impression about the girl.%0D%0ANot being 'his type' is a weak basis for breaking a marriage. That should%0D%0Ahave been ascertained before marriage. Furthermore, what is the limit of%0D%0Abeing 'his type'? It is irresponsible for a person to marry and thereafter%0D%0Asimply divorce her because she is not 'his type'.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
