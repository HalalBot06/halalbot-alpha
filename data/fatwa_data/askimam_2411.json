  "question": "What is the ruling of staying in Madinah for 8 days (40 salaah) when one isgoing for his first Hajj? Is this staying period absolutely necessary or waajib?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMadinah has many virtues e.g. the Mubarak grave of our Nabi and Khalifa?s,\nthe Raudah, Al Baqei, so to visit these places when one embarks on the\njourney of Hajj is important because to many this maybe the only time they\nget to visit these Holy Sites. But this does not mean if for some reason one\ncannot visit these sites then their Haj is incomplete. This perception is\nincorrect.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
