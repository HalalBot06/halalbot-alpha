  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan you please tell me if there are such beings as guardian angels? May Allah reward you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala has appointed guardian angels to protect man. Allah Ta'ala\nsays, 'For each person, there are angels in succession, before and behind\nhim. They guard him by the order of Allah.' (13:11)\n\nIt has been narrated on the authority of Hadhrat Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu)\nthat 'Every person has angels to protect him in the way, that no wall should\nfall on him, nor should he fall in a hole and no stray and wild animal\nshould harm him. However, if it is the command of Allah that this person be\nafflicted with some calamity, then these angels distance themselves from\nhim.' (Abu Dawud)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
