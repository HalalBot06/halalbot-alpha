  "question": "It was during Quran's tafseer that I knew of this sin as one of the most hated by Allah and I heard of its punishment... Now i want to know what should I do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI, with my few friends, committed sodomy for a few times. It started when I was not mature and I matured during the time...We did it for just pleasure; At that time, I knew it was a sin, but never knew that it is such a big sin. At that time, I hardly used to go for Jumma prayers.... but Alhamdu Lillah, I have repented from this and left the bat habbit long ago; I now pray five times a day, recite Quran daily and also take classes of \"Tajweed-e-Quran\" and Mas'ail.... It was during Quran's tafseer that I knew of this sin as one of the most hated by Allah and I heard of its punishment... Now i want to know what should I do?... I am really confused since I have heard of the punishment for a person commiting sodomy... Please reply in as much detail as possible...\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is mentioned in a Hadith, Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Everyone of you is a sinner and the best of sinners are those who repent.’\n\nYou committed a wrong and Allah guided you and made you realise the wrong. Alhamdulillah, you also made Tawbah and do righteous deeds. That is the sign of your sincerity and Insha Allah you should regard your Tawbah as accepted by Allah. Do not think of the past and continue the righteous way of life.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
