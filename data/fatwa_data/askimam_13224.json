It is without a shadow of doubt that these may be the most difficult days in your mother’s life. Use this opportunity to strengthen the bond between your mother and yourself. Be tolerant towards her and ignore all her shortcomings. It is unfortunate that a\n\nWoman in whom your mother had confidence, played this deceit on her. This is even more heartbreaking. It is natural for any wife to feel in this way when the husband remarries. Even the wives of Nabi (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) had their differences among themselves. Since the matter is fresh, the effect is strong. As time progresses your mother will become immune and gradually accept it.\n\nAs far you as a child is concerned, you should understand that your father still remains your father. Therefore, you should not compromise on your character and service to him. Diplomacy, wisdom and tolerance are vital. There could be situations where you (children) will become in between your parents. At that point, be careful and do not be hasty to comment or do anything. The slip of the tongue will land you to eternal regret and remorse.\n\nIn conclusion, consider the following two Ahadith. Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, \"Jannah lies beneath the feet of the mother\". In another Hadith Rasulullah () said, \"The pleasure of Allah lies in the pleasure of the father\". Keeping the above two Ahadith in mind, endeavour to please both parents in a manner that does not harm the other.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
