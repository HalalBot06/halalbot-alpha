  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAlhamdulillah I have been reading salaah regularly for about a year now but always break my wudhu. I am having to do wudhu 2,3, or 4 and sometime even more times to complete my Fard and Sunnah Mukkada. The doctor has told me I have IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) and this cannot be cured only managed through diet. I have tried different foods but at the moment cannot seem to relieve myself from the symptoms (constipation, bloating etc.)\n\nMy question is in this case where I am having to repeat wudhu regularly (I hardly ever complete a salaah in one wudhu) do I qualify as a Mazoor. If so can you please explain with evidence from Quran or Hadeeth relating to Mazoor. Also, an important point is although this is taking up a lot of time I am managing to read my salaah before the next salaah starts. This is stopping me from attending Jamaat at the Masjid as I always end up breaking my wudhu.\n\nIf this does qualify me as a Mazoor can I ask if it is better Taqwa to carryon repeating my wudhu until I complete my salaah without breaking.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIn principle, if you are unable to keep your wuzu for at least two rakats salah and this state remains for at least one entire salah duration, for example between Asr and Maghrib, then you are a ma’zoor.\n\nFrom your query, it appears you are a ma’zoor as you sometimes perform wuzu more than four times for fardh and sunnah salats. As a ma’zoor, you should perform your wuzu, when the salah time commences. That wuzu will remain valid for an entire salah time. For example, when Asr time sets it, you make wuzu. That will remain valid until Asr time passes by. The passing of wind for example (if that is the cause of you being a ma’zoor) will not invalidate the wuzu. You should attend jamaat and perform salah with congregation.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
