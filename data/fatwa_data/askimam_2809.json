  "question": "What is glycerine? And is it permisible to use a cream/lotion that contains glycerine? Also what types of alcohol can be used in creams and lotions?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nGenerally, glycerine is extracted from animal fat. If there is no adequate\nalternative, as a last resort, one may use glycerine or products which\ncontain glycerine for external use only.\n\nIt is not permissible to use deodorants that contain alcohol from grapes or\ndate extracts. Such perfumes are impure and Salaat with it is invalid.\nHowever, if the alcohol is synthetic, it is pure and permissible to use.\nSalaat without washing off such perfumes will be valid. Sometimes, it\nbecomes difficult to differentiate between genuine and synthetic alcohol.\nThus, to be on the safe side, one should rather prefer using deodorants and\nperfumes that are labelled as 'alcohol-free', especially when such perfumes\nare easily available.
