  "question": "In ramzaan, when you have menses, you check to see if it stopped or not at night, but it hasnâ€™t and you know that it will stop by morning. Can you still keep sawm",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. In ramzaan, when you have menses, you check to see if it stopped or not at night, but it hasn?t and you know that it will stop by morning. Can you still keep roza and take a shower after sehri time ended but before fajar time ends? Antoher words after roza has started. Or is it better to bath before fajr time starts? 2. Similar situation to above, but menses stop a little AFTER sehri time (subha saadiq), can you fast on that day? Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a woman becomes pure from her Haydh during the night or in the morning before dawn, she should fast even if she did not have a bath at night.\n\nIf a woman becomes pure after dawn, it will not be permissible for her to make the intention of fasting. In addition to this, it will not be permissible for her to eat or drink anything. She will have to spend her entire day like a normal fasting person.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
