  "question": "1. Can a person who owns hotels selling pork and alcohol be a president of Muslim Orgnanization? 2. Can a boy who was adopted as a hindu but nourished and grown up like a muslim be the leader for the muslim organization?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. A person is the managing director of a company which is operating number of hotels in a country. In the hotels they sell liquor, wine, spirits, cigarettes, etc. They also provide haram foods and cook pig meats and provide in the restaurants to the locals and the tourists.\nThe managing director is a muslim and he has major shares in the chain of hotels.\nCan such person be the national president of a Muslim organization.\n\n2. A child was born out of wed lock from a hindu (mushrik) drunkard father and Muslim mother but they have not been legally married or had nikah. The father abandons the child and the mother after birth. A muslim family adopts the child and gives him Muslim name.\n\nCan that child lead prayers in a mosque and also become an official of a muslim organization.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nI pray that you are well, and in the best of health.\n\nIt is the general policy of the Darul Iftaa not to issue a fatwa unilaterally in a specific allegation without having conducted a personal investigation on the issue.  The person in reference maybe obviously renown.  An unbalanced approach to the issue maybe to the unjust detriment of the person in reference.   \n\nAs for your second query, having a relationship with someone of the opposite gender out of wedlock is a heinous act.  Consider the following:\n\n“And do not go close to adultery; surely it is an indecency and an evil way.” (Surah Israa verse 32).\n\nThe abundance of illicit relationships and adultery is a sign of the imminence of the day of judgement.  Anas ibn Malik narrates that the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace said), \n\n“From amongst the signs of the imminence of the day of judgement are the uplifting of knowledge, the prevalence of ignorance, the consumption of wine and the abundance of adultery.”  (Sahih al-Bukhari)\n\nA child born from such a relationship is termed as walad az-zina (illegitimate offspring).  Before mentioning the ruling related to the imaamat such a child, know that it is forbidden to mock and ridicule such a person.  Allah the Almighty says,\n\n“And do not insult one another and do not call each other by [offensive] nicknames. Wretched is the name of disobedience after [one's] faith. And whoever does not repent - then it is those who are the wrongdoers.” (Surah Hujaraat verse 11)\n\nWhat fault has he done? He isn’t responsible for the actions of his biological parents, nor will he be judged accordingly in the sight of Allah the Almighty.  It is mentioned five times in the Quran, “None shall be burdened with the load of another.”\n\nThe great Hanafi jurist Mufti Rasheed Ahmed (Allah have mercy on him) mentions,\n\n“Usually the absence of a father in the life of illegitimate children, results in them not being nurtured correctly.  This creates disinclination in the hearts of those around them.  This is the sole reason why their imamah in salaah is somewhat disliked (makruh tanzihan).  However, if this reason is not found within them, and they are pious and knowledgeable, there will not be any dislike whatsoever.  Instead, their leadership will be superior to others.  This is the same ruling for all roles and positions occupied by such individuals.” (Ahsan al-fataawa 3/295)\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
