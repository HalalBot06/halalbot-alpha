  "answer": "QUESTION\nHope you are in the best of health InshAllah. I just wanted to ask a question regarding tassawuf- i wish to do bayt with a shaykh- is there anyone you can refer to help me? Also please make dua for me that i keep steadfast on the deen ond the sunnah and as i have just done my aalima exams i am in need of duas.  Also i once had a dream where i saw the prophet s.a.w giving me money. The person did not look like the prophet but i believed(in my dreams)for him to be the prophet. I did not take the money but my dad took it. what does this mean? I have posted this question before and the reply was that this is a fiqhi website and to try an alternative. I am aware that this website is a fiqhi website but i do not know any alternatives to this website.so please answer my question. jazakhallah for your help may Allah reward you abundantly. wasalam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nMay Allah Taala grant you your heart’s will and desire to get close to Him, Aameen.\n\nYou should discuss your wish to take bai’at with your father and seek his advice. Your father is your guardian and he is there to safeguard your interests. This is also the interpretation of your dream.\n\nWassalam\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa, Madrassah In'aamiyyah"
