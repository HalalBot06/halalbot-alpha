  "question": "is it a Sunnah to cut nails on friday or thursday?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Mustahabb (commendable and desirable) to pair the finger nails every%0D%0AFriday. Only a Mujahid is exempted from this and it is preferrable that he%0D%0Alenghtens his nails because it can be used as a weapon to attack the enemy.%0D%0AIt was aso the blessed habit of Nabi alaihis salaam that he would pair his%0D%0Anails and not let them grow long. It is also noted in the books on%0D%0AJurisprudence that he who lengthens his nails, his sustenance and income%0D%0Abecomes straitened and restricted. (Shaami vol. 6 pg. 405, H.M. Saeed).%0D%0A%0D%0AAlso, one should remember that at the time of wudhu it is necessary for the%0D%0Avalidity of the wudhu that water reaches below the nails if the nails are%0D%0Alonger than normal. Many a times women are busy in their choirs of the%0D%0Akitchen wherein different types of ingredients tend to stick under the nails%0D%0Aand if not removed, Wudhu will be invalid if it does reach the bottom of the%0D%0Anails. Therefore it will not be permissible to keep long nails%0D%0Aunnecessarily.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
