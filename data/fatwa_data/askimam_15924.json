  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan Jumma be praied in a Hall where regular salah doesnot take place?\nAs i understand the basic idea to eat Meat from the Alh Al-Kitaab shouldnot be necessary..\nIs it preferred to get married as soon as possible?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1.\nIt is better to pray Jum’a in the Ja’mi Masjid. (Raddul Muhtaar Pg 33 vol 3)\n\n2.\nYour question is not clear. Please rephrase\n\n3.\nThe Shariah has not specified an age for marriage.  Nikaah is fardh if one is certain he/she will be engaged in sin if not married.  If there is fear that one will engage in sin if not married, then marriage is wajib.  If there is no fear, then marriage is not wajib at anytime.  However, to keep one pure, it is virtuous to get married. (Dur Mukhtaar & Fatawaa Khawaateen vol.2 pg.4)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai (F1)\nDarul Iftaa"
