  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease urgently advise if there is any duaa that will help me with the above or if there is anything else that I can do. I was previously in a relationship with a man I thought I would marry. I am sincerely repentant of my past and would do anything to change it. I do not want to hurt this wonderful man who I'm about to marry. I absolutely cannot tell him the truth and I'm terrified he will find out on our wedding night.

Be punctual with all your salaah and read abundant nafl salaah too.Read the Quran with greater understanding and bring your lifestyle onto the Sunnah and the Quran.
