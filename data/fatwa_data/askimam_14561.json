  "question": "During Ramadan are you allowed to talk to your fiancé, or significant other?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDuring Ramadan are you allowed to talk to your fiancé, or significant other?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to the Shari’ah, the relationship of fiance/fiancee is prohibited. It is not permissible for a Ghayr Mahram (not a blood relative and with whim marriage is permissible) male and female to have a free and friendly relationship with each other. This prohibition is at all times and not only during Ramadhaan.\n\nHowever, this sinful act will be regarded as more evil during Ramadhaan and deprive one of attaining Taqwa which is the main purpose of Ramadhaan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
