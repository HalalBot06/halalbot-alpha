  "question": "If Tawaf is done incorrectly in ihraam then does one need to repeat the tawaf or penelty alone suffices?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf someone perform tawaf e ziyara with pollution, menses and returned home, then of course she will  have  to offer a badana (camel/ cow). I want to know beside offering badana , does she still require to go Holy Mecca and repeat tawaf e ziyara ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nIn principle, once a person pays penalty for a wrong committed in ihram (jinaayat) and the penalty (dam) has been paid, that is sufficient. The tawaaf does not have to be repeated.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best,\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
