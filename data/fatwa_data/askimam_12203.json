  "question": "1) illegitimate child - Can't he become a hafiz or an alim and lead a respectable and pious life? 2) removing under-arm hair by laser treatment.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) I read some previous questions asked relating an illegitmate child. I want to know that why does the illegitimate suffer the sin of his parents. He doesnt get a part in inheritance and is disliked to lead in prayers but why??? Can't he become a hafiz or an alim and lead a respectable and pious life? Does he has to suufer just because his parents comitted a sin? 2) Can we remove remove under-arm and/or below-navel hair permanantly via laser treatment (both male/female)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. A point that should be understood is that in this life every person has been put into a different situation as a test for him. Allah Ta'ala says: \"We gave some status over others, so that they may take them as subordinates\". Thus we find some born into a poor family, while others into a very rich one. One is blessed with a sharp intellect, while another is born \"slow\". Some are granted beauty while others are deprived of it. If all were equal ie. wealthy, intelligent, beautiful and powerful, then who would do the work? Who would scrub the floors and sweep the streets?%0D%0A%0D%0AThus we should realize that Allah Ta'ala in His infinite wisdom has placed every one of us in a certain position for a certain reason. Allah has not charged us with gaining wealth, power or beauty, instead he has deputed us to gain his pleasure by obeying Him. This is our responsibility which we have to carry out.%0D%0A%0D%0ASimilarly in this life, the actions of each person affects others. Some murder others, others harm them etc. If your philosophy was to be adopted, the murdered would be saying that Allah is unjust as he caused me to suffer for another wrong, the oppressed would say the same etc etc. Thus we should realize well, that we have to subdue our defect intellects to the Infinite wisdom of Allah Ta'ala. Allah Ta'ala gives opportunities to whom he wishes and cannot be questioned for His actions%0D%0A%0D%0AIt should also be noted that Islam recognises an illegitimate child as a normal Muslim and does not deny him any rights. He enjoys the same privileges and status as any other person. Yes, he doesn't inherit a share from his \"father\", yet he inherits from his other relatives. His father may make a bequest for him, of up to one third of the estate. Similarly, his leading the salah, is only disliked if the congregation dislike him. If he is an aalim or haafiz and holds a respectable standing in society, then it would be perfectly okay for him to lead the prayers. A possible wisdom behind not allowing him to inherit would be to discourage the parents from engaging in Zina, as they risk conceiving a child with a stigma on his head.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Removal of hair via laser treatment would be permissible as long as the process is not harmful and does not lead to any part of the Awrah (Private parts) being exposed to a person who is not allowed to look at them.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMl.
