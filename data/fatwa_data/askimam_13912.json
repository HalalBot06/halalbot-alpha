  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni am having a shariah beard and my collegues force me to lead salat b/c none of them is having a shariah beard, my problem is that after passing urine drops keep coming out for atleast 10 min. so i use tissue paper after doing istanja and try to go to rest room half an hour before the salat time and remove the tissue when doing wadu for salat. Is this ok ? can i lead the salat?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is permissible for you to lead the Salaat after you have completely relieved yourself.\n\n \n\n \n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
