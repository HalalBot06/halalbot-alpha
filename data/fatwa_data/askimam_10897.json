  "question": "May I know if there is any Duâ€™a for anxiety or phobia?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaikum..I think I have either social anxiety or phobia and it seems to disturb me from doing the everyday things like to go to school , to meet people even when it is my own relatives. I have read that this is a mental health disease, and is not controllable with self treatment..I want to inform my family about this, as I would like them to know what I have been going through for years but I also am afraid if they will not understand me. They might think this is something I made myself.. I would like to get treatment, which is only possible with my family?s help . Should I just tell them the truth or should I go ahead to seek help without informing them? Secondly, is there any Du?a for these kinds of mental health diseases (phobias, anxiety, panic attacks, depression)..What does Islam say about these kinds of diseases? Thank you very much. Assalamualaikum -SIti Halimah-\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) We suggest you discuss this issue with a senior member of your\nfamily before going for any kind of treatment. However, if you feel that they will not take heed of your problem, you may go ahead without informing them.\n2) Recite Ayatul kursi after every Fardh Salaah. To alleviate\ndepression the following is prescribed\n*ponder over the bounties of Jannah.\n*focus on what you have rather than on what you do not have. *look at the positive side of life. *recite the following dua abundantly La Ilaha Ila Anta Subhanaka Ini Kuntu Minaz Zalimeen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI"
