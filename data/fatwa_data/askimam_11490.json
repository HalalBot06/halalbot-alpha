  "question": "What's the longest period of time that a husband and wife can be communicating,but physically separated? Is there a specific dua for halal earning?and what if there's no alternative to haram income?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan you please elaborate on the secretions from a female that invalidate wudhu and/or bath, and that don?t? Jazakallahu khairan for your much required and appreciated time and effort Mufti sahab. I have to let you know that it is extremely difficult to ask a question in the given period of time!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Your question regarding communication between husband and wife is unclear, kindly elaborate.\n\n2. You may make Du?aa in any language for Halaal earnings. Also recite the following Du?aa, ?Allaahummak finee bi halaalila an haraamika?.\n\n3. There has to be a Halaal alternative. Allah does not compel us to do something beyond our capabilities. You are required to search for Halaal avenues of income.\n\n4. All secretions from the private parts invalidate the Wudhu. The blood of Haydh (menses) and Nifaas (post natal bleeding) invalidates Ghusl (bath). Furthermore, secretions experienced in a wet dream also invalidate the Ghusl.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI"
