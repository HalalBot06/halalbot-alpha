I knew it whould start to chase me so ran to my house. I saw my younger brother and my cousin who is the age of my younger brother looked at me and i think they noticed the dog chasing me, ran inside with me. when i was outside the entrence my house (my brother and my cousin were waiting at the door) when the dog was about the jump on me a man came out of the middle of know where and tackled the dog to the ground. the dog was over the man and picked it up by the mans thigh in its mouth and slamed it to the ground and started killing him. I watched for a second and immedatly went inside the house with by brother and my cousin who watching with me. When we entered the house they talked about how cool that was and i remember thinking that their crazy because i am very afarid of dogs.
