  "answer": "QUESTION\nRegarding pictures. I do know that angels don't enter the house in which animal resides or pictures are contained. But in todays times, it is so difficult not to have pictures at home. School books have pictures, passport, identity cards. How do we deal with this. What if the room in which we are praying doesn't have any picture, would angels then come there?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Hadith of Bukhari Shareef which explains that the angels will not enter\na home in which pictures are found only refers to such pictures which are\nkept with respect, honour and are displayed as idols. Therefore, pictures\nwhich are found in newspapers, textbooks, passport, etc. are not kept out of\nrespect, but rather kept our of necessity. Therefore, the angels will\ndefinately enter such a house. (Fathul Baari vol.10 pg.475; Qadeemi)\n\nHowever, those pictures which are unnecessary should be disposed off as\nquick as possible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
