  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf contact lenses are prescribed by an Optometrist due to medical reasons, it is permissible. It is permissible for a female to beautify herself only for her husband with contact lenses. If there is a possibility of any deception by wearing contact lenses, for example, a boy seeing a girl with the intention of marriage, then she cannot wear coloured contact lenses. It is not permissible for a male to beautify himself with coloured contact lenses. and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai FATWA DEPT."
