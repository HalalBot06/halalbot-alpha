  "question": "Parents donot allow to follow some Sunnat practices? should we follow the Sunnat or listen to the demands of our parents?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf parents donot allow to follow some sunnat practices,eg; covering head or not wearing clothes that resemble the kuffar; should we follow the Sunnat or listen to the demands of our parents? I am 18 years old.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, a child is bound to follow the instructions of his/her parents until they do not conflict with the Shari?ah.\n\nTherefore, you should advise your parents with love and wisdom that certain practise is against Islamic values and principles. We suggest you do not argue as this will increase the animosity for Deen. You continue carrying out the practices of Deen with the hope and intention of changing your parents. However, you should respect your parents at all times.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
