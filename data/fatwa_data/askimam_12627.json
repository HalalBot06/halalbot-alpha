  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have read that in Jannah a man will be blessed with maidens (Hoors) and if his wife joins him in Jannat she will be Queen of all maidens. I am steadfast in my deen and have so much love for Allah (SWT) and our Rasool (SAW) and hope if my veiw is errored I will be forgiven. But how can this be fair? A man gets Hoors and a wife for his good deeds and a woman for hers gets to share her husband openly with other beings. What about woman who do not marry or husbands are not pious what happens to them in jannat. What if a woman does not love her husband but lives a life of peity with him simply for Allahs pleasure not her own. In jannah does she once again have to be assigned to her husband. I know that Allah is the most Just and I have tears in my eyes that I am even questioning this please advise on the situation.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJannah and the condition of Jannah vastly differs from the conditions of the Dunya. It is incorrect to look at the prevailing conditions of the Dunya and then form an analogy of the Aakhira.\n\nSuffice to say that Allah Ta?ala mentions in the Qur?aan, ?You will have there (Aakhira) all that you could wish for, and you will have there everything you demand.? Thus, her every desire and wish will be fulfilled and she will live in eternal happiness.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
