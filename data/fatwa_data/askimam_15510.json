(ر, ض, خ). Khidr was a wali of Allah and a contemporary of Musa (SAW). Allah Taala bestowed him with a special type of knowledge known as Ilmul-Ladunni. His meeting with Musa (AS) and an exposition of his type of knowledge is mentioned in the Quran in Surah Kahf.\n\n2.We as human beings being Ashraful maklookat (the noblest of creations) is purely by the grace and choice of Allah Taala.\n\n3. It is not fardh upon a person to get married if one is able to control his desires in spite of him having the financial means to marry. In such situations, it is sunnah to marry. A sunnah should not be disregarded on the grounds that it is not a fardh act. The Quran and Ahadith are replete with emphasis on following the sunnah of Rasulullah (SAW). Rasulullah (SAW) said, “Nikah is my sunnah.” In another narration, Rasulullah (SAW) is reported to have said, “Whoever turns away from my sunnah is not from among me.”\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai \n\nDarul Iftaa"
