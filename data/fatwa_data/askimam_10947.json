Allah Ta?ala says indeed We created man weak. It is natural for a, man to be tempted in his%2Fher desires. However, fulfilling one?s desire in a manner you have done is indeed unnatural and inhumane. Despite knowing the gravity of the sin, you still commit the sin. There are numerous Ahadith relating to the worldly punishment of a homosexual in a Muslim country, the lightest being throwing him from a mountain. The punishment of the hereafter may well be imagined. You state you have made taubah previously. Certainly making taubah and committing the sin again displays no sincerity in one?s taubah. We suggest that you immediately sever relationship with your friend. He is not your friend but your enemy. A friend is he who will lead you to eternal success & happiness. Do not even discuss the matter with him. Ignore him totally. %0D%0A%0D%0A2)Speak to a reliable Aalim and discuss your matter with him. Insha-Allah, he will guide you according to Shariah.%0D%0A%0D%0A3)Continue making taubah for your sin. Insha-Allah, Allah will surely accept your taubah. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
