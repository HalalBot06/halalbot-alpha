  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know what are the signs both physical and emotional on a person approaching death.  Jazakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nWhen one is on the throes of death, he starts taking quick breaths, the limbs get loose, he is unable to stand, the nose becomes crooked, and the temples begin to cave in.\n\nThis is the time when death has approached and those around the person should start reciting the Kalimah in a loud voice as a reminder.\n\nAlso, to reduce the severity of death, Surah Yaseen should be recited whilst sitting near the dying person.\n\n(Bahishti Zewar, P. 196, Maktabah Makkiyah)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl. Asif Umar,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
