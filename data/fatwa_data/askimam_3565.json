  "answer": "QUESTION\nAre barelvi beleifs of Imam Ahmed Raza Khan wrong?? im sunni muslim barelvi. how can u say the barelvis are corrupt when they are the majority on the world??\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is our view that Ahmad Raza Khan held many views inconsistent with the\nShari'ah. The Barelwis are certainly not in majority.\n\nHowever, assuming they are in majority, that is no criteria of being on the\nright path. If that criteria is accepted and applied, it will imply that the\nKuffaar who exceed the number of Muslims (four times in number) are on the\nright path.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
