  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIjust want to know if mawlid is part of the sunnah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nMawlood refers to the birth of Nabi (sallahu alayhi wa sallam).  The birth of Nabi (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) was miraculous and the greatest bounty to mankind, However neither did Nabi (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) celebrate his own birth nor did the sahaba celebrated the birth of Nabi (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam).   \n\nThe common practice of celebrating mawlood in our times is neither established from Nabi (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) the sahaba, tabieen, tabe tabieen, and fuqaha. Therefore it should not be practiced, however lectures on the biography of Nabi (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) is an integral part of our deen. That should form part of our everyday life.\n\n(Fatawa Rahimiya, Vol.2. Pg.73. Darul-Ishat).\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Safraz Mohammed,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n\n\nPS.  Else where on this site much has been written on mawlood. Conduct a search on that."
