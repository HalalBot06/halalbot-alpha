  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamu Alaikum\nThanks a lot for your kind reply. I had a concern about the following product whether this could be HALAL for male hair/beard.\nBrand Name: Nurani Brown Henna (for hair)\nOn the label it says (R) & (C)\nIn other words, is any blown mehendi / color is permitted for men to be used in beard?\nIf any blown color is used in beard, would that make Salat unacceptable?\nWas Salam.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIt is permissible to dye ones hair/beard with brown mehendi, however one should avoid using black dye/mehendi as its usage is prohibited.\nThe usage of brown mehendi will not have any effect on one’s salaah.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl. Ebrahim Desai,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
