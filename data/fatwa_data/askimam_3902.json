  "question": "Please interpret a dream that I had twice",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n: I had a dream that we had big gathering in our house, then I opened the door to outside and I saw the moon and the sun both in front of me. The moon was on the right, the sun was on my left, both round. Then I saw another round object in between them. It was big orange and red ball getting bigger and bigger. I shut the door and I ran inside informing everyone that day of judgment was coming. I was trying to get everyone to say the Shahada. Then I opened the door again and the big round object was even bigger, dark clouds were everywhere. There is this Kafir lady that I know and she was there. I ran to her and kept trying to have her say the Shahada. Then I ran to the door, opened it again and it was all black dark clouds everywhere, but where the big round object was before, now I could see white bright clouds? it looked like it was a hole that would take you to somewhere. Please tell me what this could mean and what should I try to do in response to it. I had this dream two night within the same week. Same exact dream.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream is clear that the day of judgment is certain to come. However,\nthat will be when there won't be a single person to make the Dhikr of Allah\nTa'ala on earth.\n\nIt is the Barkaat of the Dhikr of Allah Ta'ala, Shahaadah, etc. that\nQiyaamat will not come sooner.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
