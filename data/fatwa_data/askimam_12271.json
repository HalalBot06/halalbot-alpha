The Fuqahaa (jurist) have mentioned that if anybody is blessed with a sibling son/daughter then it is Mustahab (preferred) to name the child on the seventh day and shave its head and give its equivalent of gold or silver as Sadaqah (charity). He should then slaughter 2 animals for a son and 1 animal for a daughter, however if only 1 animal is slaughtered for the son then too it will suffice. It is Mustahab (preferable) to distribute one third of the meat to the poor and destitute and the remaining two thirds to other relatives.
