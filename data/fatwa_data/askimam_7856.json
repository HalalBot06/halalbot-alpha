  "question": "Interpretation of dream regarding hifz...it had to do with qutting hifz), but i remember that when i awoke, i felt depressed and didnt feel like doing hifz anymore",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAlhudillah, i'm currently doing hifz. But recently, i had a dream. i dont remember what happened (it had to do with qutting hifz), but i remember that when i awoke, i felt depressed and didnt feel like doing hifz anymore. I've been in hifz for a while now, and sometimes i dont feel like reading. But when i force myself and begin reading i feel like continuing reading. But even after i started reading, after i had the dream, my mood was off. It slowly wore off in a few of days, but yesterday i had another dream. I remember i was put back into secular school and wasnt shure if i was hafiz or stopped memorizing, but now that i think about it i think i quit hifz. I still feel like reading, unlike last time, but i remember during my dream i was depressed. What do these dreams mean?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream has no significance. These are the whispers of Shaytaan stopping you from becoming a Hafiz. The virtue of a Haafiz can never be comprehended. Continue doing your Hifz with commitment and dedication and pay no attention to these dreams.\n\nMay Allah Ta?ala make you a good Haafiz whose intercession will be accepted on the day of Qiyaamat, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
