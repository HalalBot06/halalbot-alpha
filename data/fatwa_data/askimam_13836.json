You are allowed to keep dogs for security purposes provided they do not enter the house. Also, be extremely cautious about their Najaasat. If they are not within the actual house, the angels of mercy will still come.\n\n2. Life insurance is prohibited in Islam. Your trust should lie solely in Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
