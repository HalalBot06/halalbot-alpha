  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni have recently met a female who is married for the last 2 years but unhappy, her husband use to beat her up in the first 10months however that has stoped now, occationally he swears at her alot and her dead mother, we have become very close via email and telephone, i have feelings for her and i think she does aswel however while talking to her yesterday i realised as much as she wants to be with me she cant as she is married is there anything that can be done in this situation? i am 25 and she is 29\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nIn principle it is incorrect and haram for you to communicate with a married woman.\n\nYour involvement with this woman gives her more support to break up her home. Woman by nature is created weak with a very sensitive feeling, and when issues do arise in her life she would be inclined to any support, no matter whom the support is gained from.\n\n\nHowever, now that you in contact with her, you should use your influence in advising the woman to make up her home especially if she has children from her husband. You should refer both of them to an Ulama council for marriage counselling. After you have given her this advice you should completely cut of all communications with her in order for her to think for her self in making decisions.\n\n\nIf you would follow our approach, it would be for the betterment and wellbeing of the woman and not a self-centered one.\n\n\nIf her home does end up breaking without any of your involvement, that will be purely based on taqdeer, and you will not be accounted for.\n\n\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
