  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy wife does not whish to be with me any more and wants talaaq. I undertand her, she is very young and im about 9 years older than her. she says that our thinking and understanding will never match therefore the best thing is to seperate. \nMy question is that, is it ok to divorce each other if you think you will be happier without each other?   Also if a girl wanted a divorce from her husband because she was still in love with her ex fiance, would she get gunnah for doing this?  As it is very difficult for her to take her ex fiance out of her mind.  Thank you.......\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIf the husband and wife agree that they will not be able to fulfill the marital rights of each other, then they should separate amicably. Severe the Nikah through talaq. They will not be sinful for being married and not fulfilling each others rights in future.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
