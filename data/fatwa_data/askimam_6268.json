  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe jews call their state \"Israel\",the Quraan refered to the jews as children of \"Israel\" 1400 years ago.Why have they named there state after the exact Quraanic reference ? Please give detailed explanation.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIsrael is a Hebrew word, the equivalent of Abdullah in Arabic, which means\nthe 'servant of Allah'.\n\nThis was the title given to Hadhrat Ya'coob (Alayhis salaam) by the Jews. He\nhad 12 sons by which the Qur'aan makes reference to as 'al-Asbaat' (12 sons\nof Ya'coob) (Baqar Aayat136). The 12 tribes of Israel emerged from the\nprogeny of these 12 sons. Hence, they are addressed in the Qur'aan as 'Banu\nIsraaeel' (children of Israel, i.e. Ya'coob (Alayhis salaam)). So, it is\nclear that the Jews have been synonymous with the name Israel since before\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), thus, before the revelation of the Qur'\naan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
