  "question": "Is it correct that if some portion of jewelery is set a side for the daughter to be used in future when she grows up",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nZakat:\n\n \n\n \n\nAssalam Alykum wa Rahmatullahu wa Barakatu,\n\n \n\n \n\n1. Is it correct that if some portion of jewelery is set a side for the daughter to be used in future when she grows up, then Zakat on this portion of jewelery does not apply?\n\nSalaat\n\n \n\n \n\n1. I come to know from a Mufti Saheb that a Namaz is valid when prayed either on earth or anything intact with earth. As the aeroplane while flying does not fulfill this condition, the Namaz prayed on it whether in standing or sitting position must be repeated later on the ground. But in different answers to similar question on your website, I found that the Namaz prayed in standing position need not be repeated. Does any such condition exist that Namaz is valid on earth only?\n\n2. Would it be OK if I pay the Namaz in aeroplan in sitting position and then repeat it later on ground?\n\n3. I heard great rewards for making Wudho at home and going to Masjid. But the problem in most western countries is that on the way there is a great chance of a look on either almost naked picture or some person in the same way. This is more in summer time. Would the Wudho be still valid if a look goes onto such a picture or a person? Would you recommend to make Wudho in Masjid instead of home anyway?\n\n4. Sometime there is doubt after Wudho if its still valid or not due to the suspicion of urine drop. If i check it in the toilet and find that the Wudho is OK, would my Wudho be broken by looking at the private parts for sake of examining if there is some drop?\n\nFasting\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.I started fasting on 23rd of September. If I go to for celeberating Eid, my fasts may count upto either 31 or 32 depending on the moon sight. I heard that the maximum number of fasts may count upto 30. What should be done in this situation?\n\n \n\n2. In case of a journey, the destination time is back from the time of origin (3 hours difference). This means if fasting starts at the origin and ends at the destination, the fast duration would be 3 hours shorter in relation with the time of origin. Should the fast ending time be always with respect to the destination?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMisc:\n\n \n\n \n\n1.  Are there any Mazaars of the pioused people (like famous for Hazrat Karchi Rahmatullah Aliye) where the Duas are specially accepted by Allah Subhanawataala? \n\n2. Is it true that someone who dies in the month of Ramadhan would be freed from the questioning of the grave or his questioning would be postponed?\n\n \n\n \n\n3. I read in one of your ruling that it is not permissible to take a mobile phone with Quran copied on it to the toilet. Is it also valid when some Tilawat of Quran is recorded on the mobile phone\n\nJazakallahu khaira,\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nZakaat\n\n1.a) What is meant by set aside? If it is merely ones intention to give the jewelry to ones daughter in the future and have not given it to her now, then the jewelry will still belong to the parent. The parent will be responsible to pay the Zakat on the jewelry.\n\nIf the parent has given her the jewelry to the daughter as an outright gift then if the daughter is a minor and has not attained puberty, then she does not have to pay Zakat on the jewelry. The parent too will not pay Zakat on the jewelry as the jewelry does not belong to him/her.\n\n \n\n1.b) The Salah performed in an airplane with all its conditions will be valid. The Salah will not have to repeated.\n\n \n\nSalah\n\n2.) The Salah in the aero plane must be performed if one can stand and perform the Salah in the standing posture. Generally, flight attendants facilitate for the Muslim passengers to stand and perform Salah.\n\n \n\n3.) There is a great reward for performing Wudhu at home. One should keep his sight away from evil and nude pictures to the best of his ability. That dirties the heart. However the sight of such pictures do not invalidate ones Wudhu. It is advisable to repeat ones Wudhu after doing any sins.\n\n \n\n4.) The Wudhu will be valid. The looking at the private parts does not invalidate the Wudhu.\n\n \n\nFasting\n\n1) Your question is not clear. However, if you started fasting with Saudi, then that is incorrect. The one day early fast will be nafl fast and not the Ramadhan fast.\n\n \n\n2) The ending time for the fast of the point of destination will be considered\n\n \n\nMisc\n\n1)      Allah is closer to us than our jugular vain. He knows all our conditions. He listens to our Duas wherever we are.\n\n \n\n2)      If a person passes away on a Friday of Ramadhan or out of Ramadhan, he will be absolved from the questioning of the grave. The month of Ramadhan invokes the special mercy of Allah. He may absolve a person who passes away in Ramadhan from being questioned in the grave.\n\n \n\n3) The same ruling of the reciting the Quran will apply.   \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nThe ask imam site will not process questions from October 23 till October 27. You may forward your observations about the site.\n\n \n\nContact the Imam of Croydon Masjid and Islamic Centre for all the talks of Mufti Ebrahim Desai conducted through radio Ramadhan Croydon and Croydon Masjid and Islamic Centre 525 London road, Thornton Heath Croydon, Surry, CR7 6AR\n\n \n\nHappy Eid Mubarak to you\n\n \n\nMay Allah accept your ibadat in Ramadhan and grant us all His pleasure and Jannah (Aameen)"
