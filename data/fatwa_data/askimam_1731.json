  "question": "Have we done anything against the Shariah? The Masjid here runs under a fee system. It was requested that all parents whose children attend the madrasa should pay fees by a due date.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nNone of the parents paid the money. Constantly ther were asked for it. The committee members of the Masjid decided to put up the names of the persons who did not pay their children fees so as to remind them. Within a week of doing so 80% of the fees were paid and the rest 20% came in soon after. Have we done anything wrong? Jazakhullah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nFrom the details of the question and similar correspondence in the past, it appears that there are differences of opinion in the procedure adopted by the Masjid. If so, it will be appropriate to have the dissenting views as well on the matter in order for us to comment.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
