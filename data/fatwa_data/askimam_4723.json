  "question": "non-muqallid labelling others as 'mushrik' is himself a faasiq/kaafir?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMajority of our population is hanafi but a non-muqallid built a mosque here and then started labelling others as 'mushrik'. What we want to know is that because of this act 1) is he a faasiq or himself has become kaafir? 2) is it allowed to pray behind him? socialize with him? 3) what to do of prayers which we already have prayed behind him? ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSuch a person will not become a Kaafir. (Sahih Muslim with Sharh of Imaam\nNawawiy vol.1 pg.57)\n\nHowever, such an act has been despised severely in a Hadith recorded by\nImaam Muslim (RA) on authority of Abdullah ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) mentioned, 'If any person declares\nhis brother a Kaafir, then one of the two will return with that statement of\nKufr. If the accused is not guilty of Kufr, then the Kufr will return upon\nthe one who made such a statement.' (Ibid)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
