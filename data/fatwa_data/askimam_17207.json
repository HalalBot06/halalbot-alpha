If yes, please let me know the references of those Ahadeeth and please issue your Fatwa regarding this fact, whether it is true or not\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh  \n\nIt is recorded in the books of Tafseer and Hadith that Aasiyah (the wife of Fir’own) and Maryam (the mother of Isa- alayhis salaam-) will be amongst the wives of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in Jannah.\n\nHafidh Ibn Katheer (Rahimahullah) has stated that Aasiyah and Maryam will be the wives of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in Jannah, under the commentary of the verse:\n\n \n\nعَسَى رَبُّهُ إِنْ طَلَّقَكُنَّ أَنْ يُبْدِلَهُ أَزْوَاجًا خَيْرًا مِنْكُنَّ مُسْلِمَاتٍ مُؤْمِنَاتٍ قَانِتَاتٍ تَائِبَاتٍ عَابِدَاتٍ سَائِحَاتٍ ثَيِّبَاتٍ وَأَبْكَارًا\n\nIt is hoped that, if he divorces you, Allah will give him in your place wives better than you, submissive to Allah, believing, devout, penitent, steadfast in worship, fasting, previously married and virgins. (Sura Tahreem: 5)\n\n \n\nThe word (ثَيِّبَاتٍ- previously married) refers to Aasiyah and the word (وَأَبْكَارًا- virgins) refers to Maryam (Alayhimas salaam). (Tafseer Ibni Katheer, vol 4, pg 501 & 507, Idara Al-Masajid)\n\nAllamah Ali bin Abi Bakr Al-Haythami (Rahimahullah) has recorded the following Hadith:\n\nوعن أبي أمامة قال : سمعت النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم يقول لعائشة :  أشعرت أن الله قد زوجني في الجنة مريم بنت عمران وكلثم أخت موسى وامرأة فرعون  رواه الطبراني وفيه خالد بن يوسف السمتي وهو ضعيف\n\n“Abu Umamah (Radiyallahu anhu) reports: I heard Rasulullah (Sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying to Ayisha (Radiyallaahu anha): Did you know that Allah Ta’ala has married me in Jannah to Maryam (the daughter of Imran), Kulthum (the sister of Musa) and the wife of Fir’own (Asiyah)” (Majma’ Al-Zawaaid, vol 9, pg 218, Maktaba Al-Qudsi)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
