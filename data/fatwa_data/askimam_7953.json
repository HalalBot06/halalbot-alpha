  "question": "Aadam (Alayhi-Salaam) ate the forbidden fruit, but the Qur'an explains all the Ambiya were sinless was this not a sin?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. All of the Ambiya (Alayhimas Salaam) were sinless, but what about Aadam (Alayhi-Salaam) when he ate the forbidden fruit, was this not a sin? 2. If Iblis was expelled from Paradise, how did he enter to trick Aadam & Hawa (Alayhimas Salaam) to eat the fruit? 3. In your description of the Dajjal you advised Muslims to memorise the last ten verses of surah kahf, I thought it was the first ten? Hadith narrated by Abu' d-Darda' - \"If anyone learns by heart the ten ayats at the beginning of Surat al-Kahf, he will be protected from Dajjal\"\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Imaam Abu Bakr ibn Furak has stated that this mistake from Adam (Alayhis salaam) had taken place before he was chosen by Almighty Allah as a Nabi. The proof for this view is that Allah Ta?ala says in the Qur?aan, ?Thereafter, his Lord chose him (Aadam), he turned to him and greanted him guidance.? (Taha 122)%0D%0A%0D%0AThis indicates that Aadam (Alayhis salaam) was only chosen by Allah Ta?ala as a prophet later on. Imaam Qurtubi (RA), after quoting this view of Imaam Furak, says, ?And this view is good.? (Tafseer Qurtubi vol.11 pg.274)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Haafiz ibn Kathir (RA) has mentioned a few answers to this common objection. Some of them are:%0D%0A%0D%0Aa. Shaytaan was expelled from entering paradise with honour and respect. This does not necessitate that he could not enter in a disgraceful manner. Imaam Qurtubi (RA) has mentioned a narration when where there is a mention of Shaytaan entering Jannah in the form of a snake. %0D%0A%0D%0Ab. He was banned from staying in Jannat, not from passing though which could have been the case here.%0D%0A%0D%0Ac. Some also state that this was a Waswasah (a whisper into the mind) from Shaytaan which could have been done from outside paradise. (refer Tafseer ibn Kathir vol.1 pg.111 and Tafseer Qurtubi vol.1 pg.324)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. There are a few narrations of this Hadith. Some mention the first 10 Aayaats and the other the last 10. Both have been recorded by Imaam Muslim in his Sahih (Hadith1880, 1881). In fact, in the narration of Nasaaie, there is no specification of the first 10 or last 10.
