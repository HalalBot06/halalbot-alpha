If after subtracting the amount of your debt, you still possess wealth equivalent to or more than the Nisab, Zakah would be compulsory on you. On the contrary, if after subtracting the amount of your debt, your wealth does not reach the Nisab, you would not be liable to pay any Zakah. Thus, if the debt exceed Rs 80000, zakah will not be compulsory.\n\n \n\n \n\nدين العبد مانع من وجوبها (الفتاوي أنقروية 1؟9 مكتبة قاسمية)\n\n \n\nالفتاوى الهندية - (ج 1 / ص 172)\n\nومنها الفراغ عن الدين قال أصحابنا رحمهم الله تعالى كل دين له مطالب من جهة العباد يمنع وجوب الزكاة سواء كان الدين للعباد كالقرض وثمن البيع وضمان المتلفات وأرش الجراحة وسواء كان الدين من النقود أو المكيل أو الموزون أو الثياب أو الحيوان وجب بخلع أو صلح عن دم عمد وهو حال أو مؤجل\n\n \n\nبداية المبتدي - (ج 1 / ص 32 مكتبة ومطبعة محمد علي صبحخ)\n\nومن كان عليه دين يحيط بماله فلا زكاة عليه وإن كان ماله أكثر من دينه زكى الفاضل إذا بلغ نصابا\n\n \n\nفتاوي محمودية - (ج  9 / ص 322 فاروقية)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Ismail Moosa,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa\n\n \n\n \n\nWe have reproduced below an article which was published in the monthly periodical of the Darul iftaa. This article will facilitate in giving a better understanding to the query which was asked.\n\n \n\n  \n\nAllah Ta‘ālā states in the Holy Quran,\n\nوَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآَتُوا الزَّكَاةَ وَمَا تُقَدِّمُوا لِأَنْفُسِكُمْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ تَجِدُوهُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ\n\n“And establish Salāh and pay Zakāh; whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will find it with Allah. Certainly, Allah is watchful of what you do.”\n\n \n\nZakāh has two denotations in Arabic, namely growth and purification. Zakāh is paid as a means of purifying one’s wealth and fulfilling the obligation will be a means of increase and growth in the remainder of one’s wealth.\n\n \n\nCalculating Zakah:\n\nZakāh will become compulsory on a sane and mature Muslim when his / her wealth exceeds the Nisāb and this amount of wealth is maintained for the duration of one entire lunar year. The Nisāb is 20 Mithqals (87.479 g) for gold and 200 Dirhams (612.35 g) for silver. Any currency equal to the amount of any of these Nisābs will also render Zakāh binding. For example, if the price of silver is quoted at R4.40 per gram then the Nisāb will equal approximately R2, 702. If one’s wealth decreases below the Nisāb during the year but before the expiry of the year, it reaches the Nisāb, Zakāh will be binding contrary to the case of the wealth not rebounding to amount of Nisāb upon the expiry of the year. However, if one loses his entire wealth, a new lunar cycle will begin after reaching the Nisāb for the second time. All debts and liabilities will be deducted from his wealth before calculating his estate. Only that particular year’s liabilities will be deducted from long-term debts such as car / home financing. Loans given and other receivables into one’s estate will be accounted for even if the person is not paid by his debtor for several years. Any gold or silver items such as jewelry, ornaments etc will also form part of Zakatable assets as long as the percentage of gold or silver in the item is more than the metal alloy with which it is amalgamated. Similarly, any items purchased for trade will be subject to Zakat and must be accounted for in the calculation. A person should add his / her cash savings, values of gold and/or silver, value of the merchandise of trade and any receivables from debts etc. Thereafter, he / she should deduct the amount of debts owed to others. If the value of the net total equals the Nisāb of gold or silver, he / she will have to pay 2.5% of the amount in Zakāh. Hereunder is a brief chart illustrating the calculation of Zakāh.\n\n \n\n \n\nPersonal Wealth\n\n\t\n\nAmounts:\n\n\n\n\n1.   Amount of Cash and Savings at home or in the bank\n\n\t\n\nR 10,000\n\n\n\n\n2.   Current value of any gold and silver jewelry, coins, utensils etc\n\n\t\n\nR 5,000\n\n\n\n\n3.   Value of  assets and merchandise for trade\n\n\t\n\nR 20,000\n\n\n\n\n4.   Receivables and loaned amounts to others\n\n\t\n\nR 5,000\n\n\n\n\nTotal these amounts here:\n\n\t\n\nR 40,000\n\n\n\n\nAmount Debts to be paid:\n\n\t\n\nR 20,000\n\n\n\n\nSubtract the total amount of debts for the year from the above amount.\n\n\t\n\n\nNett Total of Zakatable Wealth\n\n\t\n\nR 20,000\n\n\n\n\nif the net total of Zakatable Wealth is more than the Nisab amount then…\n\n\t\n\n\nMultiply the nett total by 2.5% (nett amount x 0.025)\n\n\t\n\nR 500"
