  "answer": "QUESTION\nA woman delivered a baby about a month ago through a ceassarean operation. The doctor said that the operation wound may take upto 6 months to recover. She is also breast-feeding the baby. She has been adviced to keep herself healthy with proper intake of food. Since Ramadan is commencing after 1 month, is it permissible for her to miss her fasts in the month of Ramadan and make up for it later. Please advice.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta?ala says in the Qur?aan, ?If a person is sick (whilst in Ramadhaan) or on a journey, then complete fast on other days (besides Ramadhaan).\n\nIf by not eating there is harm feared to either the woman or her childn, it will be permissible for her to continue eating and keep Qadhaa of Ramadhaan whenever she is able to.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
