You can find all the details you are looking for in any of the following books: Aadaabul Mu?aasharah and Islaahi Nisaab. Both are by Hadhrat Moulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi [ra] and are very detailed and reliable. They are available in Pakistan ? both in English and Urdu.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. A person will never really know whether he has done his deeds with Ikhlaas. Only once he goes before Allah will he realise the condition of his deed. Thus, a person should constantly fear that his deeds will be rejected for being insincere. Some Ulama have mentioned that a person repeating a good deed is an indication that his previous deed was accepted, thus he was given tawfeeq (ability) to repeat it.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. You will not be sinful for a mistake.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Being constant on the usage of Miswaak and reading the du?aa after Adhaan aree ways to get khatana or imaan.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. This is the opinion of certain Ulama, however, caution would demand that we refrain from photographs as our senior Ulama were all of the opinion that they are not permissible under all conditions.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
