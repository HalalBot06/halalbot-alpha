  "question": "1)husband says that after marriage wife should give 1st preference/love/affection to husband and then to her mom and others. Is he right ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) I told & argued with my husband that he and my mom are like my eyes & I give the same level of respect to both of them. My husband says that after marriage wife should give 1st preference/love/affection to husband and then to her mom and others. Is he right or I m right? (2) Can i do Taimum and read my farz and other salats, cause when I do the wudhu with normal water (not warm/boiled) I easily catchup cold & that sometimes leads to headache/fever. please reply..\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. At the outset, there are different types of love; love for the husband is vastly different to the love and affection a woman has to her mother. So, in terms of love, you should love both of them although the type of love would differ. As far as respect goes, you should respect both of them ? your husband as well as your mother. However, where there is a clash between the obedience of your husband to that of your mother, your husband should be given preference provided it does not constitute disobedience to the Shari?ah.\n\n2. We suggest you use warm water to make Wudhu. We are certain that you have the facilities to warm the water at your disposal. If you are unable to warm the water, you may make Tayammum as a last resort and if you are certain that you will get sick by using ordinary water.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
