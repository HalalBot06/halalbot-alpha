  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nRespected Mufti Asalaamualikum\n\nIn our business we design logos, catalogues and websites. What is the Islamic ruling on Intellectual Property I understand that if a client supplies his pictures we should not uses his designs, pictures etc for another client. But what is the ruling when a client says that we should not design a logo or catalogue or website for a company similar to his (i.e his competition) for 2 years or even for a very long time ? Should we take on work like this or should we rather say that we do not agree with their terms if Shariah doesn’t allow this ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\n \n\nYour clients may register the logos, catalogues and websites you designed for them. You will then be regulated by the terms and conditions of such registration. If your clients did not register the work you did for them, then you cannot make an identical logo, catalogue or website for another client as these designs are ment to be the exclusive right of an individual or company. You may design a similar logo etc. on condition it does not lead to deception to client.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
