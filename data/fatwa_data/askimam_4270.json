  "question": "Cousins inappropriate behaviour. PLEASE HELP!",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu Alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh I found out that my cousin is spreading rumours about me behind my back, saying i wanted to marry him eventhough it was the other way around. Now when i am in a gathering, the other lady cousins take glances at me and whisper something in each others ears and laugh at me at times. I have been patient, and even told them it is the other way around, but they dont believe me. Sometimes i feel like making negative dua against them. What should I do in this situation? JazakAllah Khair Wassalamu Alaikum\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf what you say is true then your cousins are guilty of committing geebat\n(back biting) which is a major sin. That for you is a recompense for your\nsins and a means of your position being elevated in the sight of Allah. You\nshould continue to exercise restraint and turn your gaze to Allah. You\nshould not respond in any way including making negative dua, as Allah is All\nKnowing. He will deal with the matter in the most appropriate way.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
