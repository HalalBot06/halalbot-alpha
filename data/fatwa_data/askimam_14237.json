  "question": "what is the ruling, must he make nikaah before expiry of iddat. or can he take her back smilingly",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nA person uttered to his wife \"i am giving you one talaaq\" Subsequently he wrote a letter the next day stating \"i (persons name) hereby give you my wife one talaaq baain\n\nIf he wants her back, what is the ruling, must he make nikaah before expiry of iddat. or can he take her back smilingly\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf a man gives his wife a Talaaq-e-Baain, it will not be permissible for him to take her back without renewing the Nikah.\n\nIt will also be important to note that 2 divorces have fallen. If another divorce is issued, he will not be able to take his wife back at all unless she consummates a marriage with another man after her iddah and sits in iddah once again after the second man divorces her.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
