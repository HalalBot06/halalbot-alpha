  "question": "What is the ruling on passing on material against Islam, such as web sites and flyers, etc?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRecently I recieved an e-mail containing a christian comic. The comic tries to convince the reader that Allah is the moon god (astaghfirullah). The brother passed it onto to many muslims with the intention of letting them know what missionaries ar doing to fight Islam. I was wondering if it is appropriate to pass on such material to the laymen?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are positive as well as negative factors in passing on such\nliterature.\n\nThe positive being creating an awareness to abstain and save others from the\nwrong information contained therein. The negative being, a person with weak\nfaith may believe the information and lose his Imaan. Since the negative\nfactor is more injurious, the positive factor should not be considered and\ntherefore such material should not be circulated. The above is our humble\nopinion.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
