  "answer": "QUESTION\nAccording to reply to question 7254, i found the following lines \"As you may know that you can marry a woman for 4 things but that what would satify us is the Deen. So there is everything right in marrying an Alima and nothing wrong.\" Please give me the related hadith or any related quranic verses. Jazakallahu khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?A woman is normally sought in marriage for four reasons; a) For her wealth, b) For her lineage, c) For her beauty, and d) For her Deen. (You should) become successful (by choosing one because) of her Deen. (If you do not choose on the basis of Deen, then) you will regret (lit. your hands will be rubbed in sand).? (Mirqaat vol.6 pg.188)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
