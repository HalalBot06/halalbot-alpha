  "question": "Is Emulsifier 471 haram or halal? I have heard that it is haram.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOur investigations at the local laboratory confirmed that there are around\n1000+ emulsifiers and half are plant based and half are animal based. In\norder to determine the respective animal/plant base will be a mammoth task -\neach product containing emulsifier will need to be analysed individually.\nMore importantly, companies are constantly experimenting ingredients of\nproducts each day and therefore, the change in case of one type of\nemulsifier coud be changed the next day.
