  "question": "Is Salaah not valid if both feet do not touch the ground at any point during the Salaah? If one foot touches the ground at all times - then the Salaah is valid?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If both your feet are above the ground in Sajdah for the duration of ?three Tasbeehs?, then the Salaat is invalid. If only one foot is on the ground, the Salaat will be valid, but Makrooh. (Shaami vol.1 pg.449)\n\n2. If only one foot touches the ground in the standing position, it would be Makrooh. However, the Salaat is valid. (Hindiyah vol.1 pg.68)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
