  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPreferred (Mustahabb) way of carrying the Janazah (Hearse)%0D%0A%0D%0AOur beloved Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has said, 'that when a%0D%0Aperson who goes with a 'Janaaza', dies then the Angels will walk behind his%0D%0AJanaaza and Allah Ta'ala will descend His mercy upon his soul.' After%0D%0Aputting the deceased in the coffin, it should be carried on the 'shoulders'%0D%0Afrom all four sides and everyone must keep changing so that everyone has the%0D%0Aopportunity to help in carrying the deceased to the graveyard. You should%0D%0Awalk quickly while carrying the Janaaza but not too quickly, so that the%0D%0AJanaazah will start moving. (Hidaaya 162)%0D%0A%0D%0AWhile carrying the coffin, the deceased head must be towards the front, this%0D%0Ais the Sunnat method. It is 'Makrooh' (undesirable) to stand up as a sign of%0D%0Arespect on seeing a Janaazah.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Sunnat method of carrying a Jansaaza is to lift the coffin from the%0D%0Afront right side of the deceased, and carry on our right shoulder and walk%0D%0Aat least ten steps. Then hold the rear side of the same side, and walk at%0D%0Aleast ten steps carrying the coffin on your right shoulder. After this hold%0D%0Athe left side of the deceased, starting at the front of the coffin and carry%0D%0Ait on your left shoulder for at least ten steps. Then hold the rear side of%0D%0Athe same side, and carry on your left shoulder for at least ten steps. After%0D%0Athis also keep carrying the Janazah in the same manner changing shoulders.%0D%0AIt is better to walk behind the Janazah, but owing to the crowd or%0D%0Aconsidering the facility of the people it is permissible to walk in front of%0D%0Athe Janazah or the right or left of the Janazah.%0D%0A%0D%0AGuidance:%0D%0A1. It is permissible to carry the corpse of a deceased child (an INFANT or%0D%0ASMALL CHILD) in ones ARMS, individually by different person.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The people escorting the Janazah should remain silent (DO NOT ENGAGE IN%0D%0AWORLD TALK or AFFAIRS). It is MAKRUH to recite any Dua or Aayat of the%0D%0AQuraan aloud. But it is Mustahab (preferred) for them to recite La illaha%0D%0AIllallah softly and to worry in their HEARTS about what will happen to the%0D%0Adeceased in the grave. (Bahar 192%2F2, Tahtavi 332)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. It is Makruh to sit down before putting the Janazah down.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. When praying the Janazah Salah, the corpse's head should be at the right%0D%0Aside and the feet towards the left side when facing the Qiblah.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. If the Janazah is of a neighbour, relative or some pious (religious)%0D%0Aperson then it is better to go with the Janazah than to engage in Nafil%0D%0ASalah. (Alamgiri 162).%0D%0A%0D%0AJanazah Salah%0D%0AOur beloved Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has said, \"that one who%0D%0Aprays the Janazah Salah, will earn the reward of one \"Qeeraat\" (one Qeeraat%0D%0Ais equal to the mountain of UHUD) Sawaab, and when he goes to the graveyard%0D%0Aand stays there until the burial is completed, he will earn the reward of%0D%0Atwo \"Qeeraat\" of Sawaab.\" (Abu Dawood 451).%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Janazah Salah is \"FARDH KIFAAYAH on all Muslims present. It consists of%0D%0AFOUR TAKBEERS, THANA, DUROOD, and a MASNOON DUA for the deceased and TWO%0D%0ASALAAMS, all these are said SILENTLY by both the Imam and the Muqtadis (the%0D%0Apeople behind the Imam in Salah). Just the Imam should call out the TAKBEERS%0D%0Aand SALAAM aloud.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHERE ARE TWO FARZ IN JANAZAH SALAH%0D%0A1. To Stand and perform the Salah.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. To recite all the FOUR TAKBEERS.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE MASNOON MANNER OF PERFORMING THE JANAZAH SALAH%0D%0A1. The body of the deceased should be placed with the head on the Right side%0D%0Aof the Imam, who will face the Qiblah.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The Imam should stand in line with the CHEST of the deceased whilst%0D%0Aperforming the Salah.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. It is MUSTAHAB to make an odd number of SAFS (rows). The Safs for Janazah%0D%0ASalah should be close to one another, because there are no Sajdahs to be%0D%0Amade.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. After the Safs are straightened the NIYYAT should be made thus: \"I AM%0D%0APERFORMING THIS JANAZAH SALAH FOR ALLAH BEHIND THIS IMAM\". (The Janazah%0D%0ASalah being a Dua for the deceased). After the Niyyah the hands should be%0D%0Araised upto the EARS, and the Imam should say \"ALLAHU AKBAR\" loudly, and the%0D%0AMuqtadis softly, then fold them under the navel similar to all daily Salah.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Then recite THANA softly:%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0ASubhaanaka allaahumma wa bihamdika wa tabaaraka ismuka wa ta'aala jadduka wa%0D%0Ajalla thanaa-uka wa laal ilaaha ghayruka%0D%0A%0D%0ATrans: Glory be to You Oh Allah, and praise be to You, and blessed is Your%0D%0Aname, and exalted is Your Majesty, and there is none to be served besides%0D%0AYou.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. The Imam will then recite the Takbeer aloud and the Muqtadis softly for%0D%0Athe second time. The hands should \"Not\" be raised when saying this and all%0D%0Asubsequent Takbeers. The Duroode Ibrahim should now be recited:%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AAllaahumma salli alaa muhammadin wa alaa aali muhammadin kamaa sallayta alaa%0D%0Aibraaheema wa 'alaa aali ibraaheema innaka hameedun majeed. Allaahumma%0D%0Abaarik 'alaa muhammadin wa 'alaa aali muhammadin kamaa baarakta 'alaa%0D%0Aibraaheema wa 'alaa aali ibraaheema innaka hameedun majeedun.%0D%0A%0D%0ATrans: Oh Allah! Shower Your mercy upon Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) and the followers of Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), as%0D%0AYou showered Your mercy upon Ibrahim (Alayhis salaam) and the followers of%0D%0AIbrahim (Alaihis Salaam.) Behold You are Praise worthy, Glorious. Oh Allah!%0D%0AShower Your blessings upon Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, as You%0D%0Ashowered Your blessings upon Ibrahim (Alaihis Salaam) and the followers of%0D%0AIbrahim (Alaihis Salaam). Behold You are Praise worthy, Glorious.%0D%0A%0D%0A7. Thereafter the Takbeer should be said for the THIRD time, and the%0D%0Afollowing Dua be recited for an adult male or female:%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AAllaahumma ighfir lihayyinaa, wa mayyitinaa, wa shaahidinaa, wa ghaa-ibinaa,%0D%0Awa sagheerinaa, wa kabeerinaa, wa dhakarinaa wa unthaanaa. Allaahumma man%0D%0Aahyaytahoo minnaa fa ahyihee 'alal islaam wa man tawaffaytahoo minnaa%0D%0Afatawaffahoo 'alal iemaan%0D%0A%0D%0ATrans: Oh Allah! Forgive those of us that are alive and those of us that are%0D%0Adead; those of us that are present, and those of us who are absent; those of%0D%0Aus that are young, and those of us that are adults; our males and our%0D%0Afemales. Oh Allah! Whomsoever of us You keep alive, let him live as a%0D%0Afollower of Islam, and whomsoever You cause to die, let him die as a%0D%0ABeliever.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AFor a child who has not reached the age of puberty the following Dua should%0D%0Abe recited after the THIRD Takbeer:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Duaa for Boy%0D%0A%0D%0AAllaahumma ij'alhu lanaa faratan, wa j'alhu lanaa ajran wa dhukhran wa j'%0D%0Aalhu lanaa shaafi'an wa mushaffa'an.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Duaa for Girl%0D%0A%0D%0AAllaahumma ij'alhu lanaa faratan, wa j'alhaa lanaa ajran wa dhukhran wa j'%0D%0Aalhaa lanaa shaafi'atan wa mushaffa'atan%0D%0A%0D%0ATrans: Oh Allah, make him%2Fher (this child) a source for our salvation; and%0D%0Amake him%2Fher a source of reward and treasure for us; and make him%2Fher an%0D%0Aintercessor for us, and one whose intercession is accepted.%0D%0A%0D%0A8. The Imam should say the FOURTH Takbeer and there after recite the Salaam%0D%0Aaloud TWICE, while turning his face first towards the Right shoulder and%0D%0Athen once again while turning his face towards the left shoulder. The%0D%0AMuqtadis should follow by saying the Takbeer and Salaam SOFRLY.%0D%0A%0D%0ALATE COMERS TO THE JANAZAH SALAH%0D%0AWhen a LATE COMER FEARS that if he engages himself in WUDHU, he will miss%0D%0Athe Janazah Salah, then ONLY is it permissible for him to make TAYAMMUM and%0D%0Ajoin the Jama'at. This applies to the Janazah Salah only.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhomsoever arrived for the Janazah Salah after the Imam has recited ONE or%0D%0Amore Takbeers; he should wait and join the Imam when he says the next%0D%0ATakbeer. After the Salaam he should complete the missed Takbeers by merely%0D%0Asaying \"Allahu Akbar\" once for every Takbeer missed. NO Dua should be read.%0D%0AIf the Imam has completed the FOURTH Takbeer then too, the late comer should%0D%0Ajoin and complete all the missed Takbeers, (before the Imaam says the%0D%0ASalaam).%0D%0A%0D%0AGuidance%0D%0A1. If a child makes sound after the birth, or any part of the body moves,%0D%0Aand then dies, a name should be given to the child and buried after Ghusal,%0D%0AKafn and performing Janazah Salah, (Shami, Alamgiri).%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Where the Janazah (Salah) Jama'at is held in the Masjid it is%0D%0AMakruh-e-tahrimi (not permissible) to pray Janazah Salah in the Masjid. Our%0D%0Abeloved Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam has said, \"that whoever will pray%0D%0AJanazah Salah in the Masjid will not get any reward. (Hidayah 161, Alamgiri%0D%0A165).%0D%0A%0D%0A3. There are TWO FARZ (compulsory) obligations in Janazah Salah only.%0D%0A%0D%0A(a) Four Takbeers, and%0D%0A%0D%0A(b) Pray Salah standing. i.e. Salah will be \"VALID\" if four Takbeers are%0D%0Arecited in a standing state, but if any Takbeer is missed then the Salah%0D%0Awill be \"VOID\". The Duaa's that are recited in Janazah Salah are \"SUNNAT\".%0D%0AHence one must commit the Du'aas to memory as soon as possible if you have%0D%0Anot already done so. Alas it is a pity that some Muslim Brothers who perform%0D%0Atheir DAILY FIVE FARZ Salah, do not perform the Janazah Salah saying \"THEY%0D%0ADO NOT KNOW HOW TO PERFORM JANAZAH SALAH). Do we not recite THANA and DUROOD%0D%0AIBRAHIM in every Salah therefore there is only the THIRD Takbeer's Dua%0D%0Aremaining, and this can be easily memorised with ALLAH SUBHANA WATALLAH'S%0D%0Ahelp. So every Muslim Brother must pay heed to this, otherwise it will be%0D%0Aregarded as if you have not fulfilled the right of your Muslim%0D%0ABrother%2FSister by not performing the Janazah Salah for him%2Fher.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. If one has been buried without performing the Janazah Salah, then Janazah%0D%0ASalah \"MUST BE PERFORMED BY THE DECEASED GRAVE WITHIN 3 DAYS\". (Sahih Qaul).%0D%0AIt is said that one must perform the Janazah Salah besides the deceased%0D%0Agrave at least before the stomach of the deceased has burst. (Shami 826%2F1).%0D%0A%0D%0A5. If you anticipate the danger of missing the Janazah Salah by performing%0D%0AWUDHU then in spite of water being available it is permissible to make%0D%0A\"TAYAMMUM\" but only for the Janazah Salah and not the DAILY FIVE FARZ Salah."
