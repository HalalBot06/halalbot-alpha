  "question": "If we enter the masjid when the Jummah Khutbah is in progress should we pray 2 rakat nafil before sitting?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome brothers keep quoting the hadith that the Prophet Sallahu Alaihi Wassalam asked a man get up and pray 2 rakat. Is this a special case? If so can you please quote the full hadith and give a detailed answer since it causes a lot of confusion to many of us. Jazakallah Khairan\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Taala commands us in the Holy Quraan: \"When the Quraan is read, listen%0D%0Ato it with attention and hold your peace: that ye may receive mercy.\" (Verse%0D%0A204, Surah Al-A'araaf)%0D%0A%0D%0AMany commentators like of Mujaahid, Ibn Juraij and Saeed ibnul Musayib%0D%0A(R.A) are of the opinion that the above verse also refers to the period of%0D%0Athe Jumuah Khutba and Salaat. ( Tafseer Ibn Katheer - vol 2)%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah Sallallaahu-alaihi-wasallam has also mentioned: \"When one of you%0D%0Aenters the masjid whilst the imaam is on the pulpit (delivering the khutba)%0D%0Athen he should not perform any salaat nor should he speak until the imaam%0D%0Acompletes (the sermon).\" (Tabrani)%0D%0A%0D%0AA hadith in Musnad Ahmad also suggests that when one enters the Musjid for%0D%0ASalaatul-Jumua and the imaam has already commenced the sermon, then one%0D%0Ashould sit down and listen attentively to the sermon and not perform any%0D%0Asalaat. ( Musnad Ahmad pg. 75, vol 5)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above has been the practise of many eminent Sahaba (R.A.) and Tabi'een%0D%0Asuch as Hazrat Umar (R.A), Uthman (R.A), Ali (R.A), Ibn Abbas (R.A), Imam%0D%0AMalik, Laith, Abu-Hanifa,Thawri, Ibn Sireen (R.A). ( Sharh Muslim -Pg 287,%0D%0Avol 1 %2F Musannaf ibn abi Shaiba Pg.20, vol 2 )%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, Imaam Shafie and Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal (R.A), are of the opinion%0D%0Athat it is mustahab (preferable) for one who arrives after the imaam has%0D%0Acommenced his sermon to perform his Tahiyyatul-musjid. (Sharh-Muslim- Nawawi%0D%0Ap.g 287) They have based their view on the strength of an incident that%0D%0Aoccurred with Hazrat Sulaik Al-Ghatfani (R.A). Hazrat Jabir R.A narrates%0D%0Athat Sulaik Al - Ghatfani entered whilst Rasulullah%0D%0ASallallaahu-alaihia -wasallam was delivering the Friday sermon and sat%0D%0Adown. Rasulullah Sallallaahu-alaihi wasallam enquired of him if he had%0D%0Aperformed his salaat.When he replied in the negative, Rasulullah%0D%0ASallallaahu-alaihi wasallam then ordered him with the following: a) to%0D%0Astand up b) perform 2 rakaats( nafl-salaat) c) keep the salaat brief%0D%0AKitaabul-Jumuah - Sahih Muslim P.g 287, Vol-1)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe majority of the scholars who do not hold the same view as Imaam Shafie &%0D%0AAhmad bin Hanbal (R.A ), explain the above hadith to be a special case%0D%0Aconcerning Hazrat Sulaik (R.A.) only. This line of reasoning has been%0D%0Asupported by a narration of Hazrat Abu Saeed Al-Khudri R.A that Rasulullah%0D%0ASallallaahu-alaihi wasallam had ordered him to offer his 2 rakaats of%0D%0Asalaat. He (Sallallaahu-alaihi wasallam) encouraged the sahaaba to be%0D%0Acharitable towards him, upon seeing his down-trodden condition. ( Kitaabul-%0D%0AJumua, Nasaai -Pg.208, vol 1) Hence the deduction of these scholars%0D%0Aindicates that the reason for Rasulullah Sallallaahu-alaihi wasallam's%0D%0Aordering him to perform his salaat was for the sahaaba to notice his%0D%0Apitiable, poor and downtrodden condition. In this way Rasulullah%0D%0ASallallaahu-alaihi wasallam encouraged charity towards him.%0D%0A%0D%0ANotwithstanding the above incident, Rasulullah Sallallaahu-alaihi wasallam%0D%0Anever commanded any other latecomer to stand up and perform his%0D%0Atahiyyatul-musjid, as he commanded Hazrat Sulaik (R.A). There are many%0D%0Aincidents which substantiate this view, where a late comer was not commanded%0D%0Aby Rasulullah Sallallaahu-alaihi wasallam to offer his salaat. To the%0D%0Acontrary he was instructed to sit down and not cause any inconvenience to%0D%0Aothers. (Nasaai- p.g 207 ) Some narrations also mention that Rasulullah%0D%0ASallallaahu-alaihi wasallam stopped his sermon, waited for Hazrat Sulaik%0D%0A(R.A) and resumed his sermon after he had completed his salaat.( Musannaf%0D%0Aibn Abi Shaiba-pg.20-vol2) This clearly indicates that Hazrat Sulaik (R.A)%0D%0Adid not perform his 2 rakaats during the sermon. Rasulullah%0D%0ASallallaahu-alaihi wasallam had also asked him to make his salaat brief%0D%0A(whilst he waited for him).This also emphasizes the importance of listening%0D%0Ato the sermon. Infact Rasulullah Sallallaahu-alaihi wasallam prohibited any%0D%0Aother activity during the sermon, so that one listens to the advices of the%0D%0Asermon. Even commanding someone with good during the sermon was prohibited,%0D%0Aalthough it is normally wajib act. Hence, if a wajib act was not permitted,%0D%0Athen how will a nafl act be given preference over it? (Al bahruraaiq p.g 271%0D%0Avol 2)%0D%0A%0D%0A%3EFrom the above, it can be concluded that it is advisable for the latecomer%0D%0Ato sit down and listen to the Friday Sermon and not to engage in any nafl%0D%0Asalaat. This viewpoint is strongly supported by the majority of the eminent%0D%0Aand pious predecessors.Even, great scholars like Imaam Shafie & Imaam Ahmad%0D%0Abin Hambal are of the opinion that at the most, it is sunnat (and not%0D%0Acompulsory) for the latecomer to perform the tahiyyatul-musjid , during the%0D%0Asermon.
