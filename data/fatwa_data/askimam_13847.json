  "answer": "QUESTION\nQuestion 1: Can you tell me a bit more about Tafseer-e Jalalain? Info like : who it's written by, when it was written, how authentic and indepth it is, etc.\n\nQuestion 2:\nThis question is about inheritence. Here is the scenario:\nA father has 3 sons, among which the first two are married. The father passes away. The mother is alive. At the time of father's death, the inheritence issue wasn't taken care of (ie. the wealth wasn't divided).\nOneday, the eldest son of the family passes away, leaving his wife behind, with no children. The family now wants to divide up father's wealth. How should it be divided according to the Shari'ah?\nThe alive persons are :\n-mother\n-first son's wife (no kids)\n-second son, his wife (no kids)\n-third son (no wife).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Tafseer Jalaalayn was initiated by Allaamah Jalaluddin al-Mahalli and was completed by his student Allaamah Jalaluddin Suyuti, a Shaafi’ee scholars of Egyptian descent who passed away in 911AH. Their Tafseer enjoys unanimous acceptance and is an integral part of every Darul Uloom syllabus in the world.\n\n2.
