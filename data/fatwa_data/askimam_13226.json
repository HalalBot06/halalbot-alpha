  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is happening in the world today, is any of it pointing towards the coming of dajjal.\n\nAsalamualaikum I wanted to ask if there is any hadith or anything which tells us that any of the things happeneing today point towards the coming of the great liar, dajjal.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere is no incident specifically indicating the coming of Dajjaal. However, the minor signs of Qiyaamat (day of judgment) are already apparent and ever increasing.\n\nRasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] stated in many Ahaadith that before Qiyaamat there will be widespread ignorance (of Deen), ac of (Islamic) education, drinking of wine and music. He also stated that people who were once poor will compete with another in wealth. The children will be disobedient to their parents. Wrong and unqualified people holding positions of trust is also one of the signs of Qiyaamat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
