  "question": "The question is was the work of daawah part of Prophet Easaâ€™s a.s. syariat? Or is the current Christian missionary work of the Christians an invented phenomenon?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe know that the virtues of this ummat over the previous ones lie in the work of daawah. But we know that the Christians also do preach their religion.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nEvery single prophet was sent into this world for the guidance of man.\nTherefore, the work of Da'awah was the actual object behind the deputation\nof prophets onto the earth. However, unlike our Ummah, the people of the\nprevious nations never did the work of Da'wah as widely as possible.\n\nNevertheless, even if missionary work took place previously as it takes\nplace presently, this will in no way whatsoever, give them superiority or\nmake them equal to our Ummah for the simple reason that Christianity has\nbeen abrogated by Islam. Our Ummah being the best of all nations is based on\nits responsibility - the work of Da'awah - although the Christians are aldo\ndoing missionary work. It is of no use at all, neither will they be rewarded\nfor it - in fact they will be taken to task, simply because Christianity has\nbeen abrogated by Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
