Allah jalla jalāluhu loves those who repent from their sins . Such a person becomes as pure from sins as if he never committed sin.\n\nAllah jalla jalāluhu says, Verily, Allah love those who repents (Al Qur’an)\n\nIn one hadith Nabi kareem sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam mentioned that if a person were to sin so much that it fills the space between the earth and the sky, and thereafter repents then Allah jalla jalāluhu will most certainly forgive him.\n\nMake excessive Ibadah in the last ten days of Ramadhan to compensate for your mistakes. Do not despair due to your dream.  However, while you try to rectify your shortcoming, this should not stop you from tabligh. You can preach islam under the guidance of Ulama’. While you do your tabligh, make it a habit to make constant istighfaar for your sins everyday.\n\nThose who preach good but fail to practice themselves will be punished on the day of judgment. Therefore, one should practice and preach good in order to attain the help and bounties of Allah jalla jalāluhu.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl. Abdur Rahman Shareef,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
