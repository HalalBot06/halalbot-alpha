  "question": "says that since they had sex they HAVE TO get married or Allah Taa'la will never forgive them",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am in urgent need of ur advice. My friend and her boyfriend broke up after a year and a half of going out. Unfortunately they had sex, which SHE regrets very much and has repented alot and is continuing to do so. The problem is, the guy wont let it go. He wants to stay with her no matter what. He says that since they had sex they HAVE TO get married or Allah Taa'la will never forgive them and they are bond to go to hell. Im not sure that is correct. I thought that as long as the two people ask for forgiveness, Inshallah Allah Taa'la will forgive them and they can move on. My friend does not want to marry him. While she was with him, she started thinking like him. Doing wrong things wasnt a big deal for her. But she realized her mistake and now only wants to do the right thing. The guy on the other hand, he doesnt pray or read the qur'an and worst of all, he has no fear of Allah Taa'la. She does not want to marry that guy. Inshallah she wants to marry a pious guy. Plz help us Imam Sahib. What can she do so she can move on? Is it true that they HAVE TO get married just because they had sex. Plz help us.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is encouraging to note that the girl has realised her wrong and wishes to change her life. Insha Allah, Allah will accept her repentance and keep her firm, Aameen.\n\nIf the girl does not want to marry the boy, she does not have to even though she engaged in a sinful and immoral act with the boy. She should be strong and keep away from the boy. He is like a vulture that wishes to feed on her. She shouldn’t submit to his bad and evil demands. She knows what is right and do just that. Don’t fear the boy, fear Allah. Allah will protect her, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
