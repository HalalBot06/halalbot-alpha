  "question": "Kindly explain the procedure of performing Istikhaara for a female duringmenses as she cannot perform Salaat in that state.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe performing of two Rakaats Nafl Salaat with the intention of Istikhaara is desirable, it is not a prerequisite for the validity of the Istikhaara. It would suffice to perform Wudhu and recite the Dua of Istikhaara on her Musalla (prayer mat) before sleeping without performing the Salaat for Istikhaara.\n\nFrom Al Mahmood 10\n\n\n\n\n27 Aug 2000"
