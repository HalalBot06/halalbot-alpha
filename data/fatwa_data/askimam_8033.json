  "question": "my marriage with my ex-wife was very traumatic for me and I donâ€™t feel like I can trust any woman enough to get married ever again. What can I do to change that?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was married and divorced. My ex-wife was emotionally abusive to me and to our children and she had an affair with another man. I know that as a Muslim, I cannot renounce marriage and I want to marry again, Insha Allah. The problem is that my marriage with my ex-wife was very traumatic for me and I don?t feel like I can trust any woman enough to get married ever again. What can I do to change that?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn your matter, there are two parties; a) the sincere one (yourself), and b) The insincere one (your wife).\n\nThere are many sincere and insincere people besides you and your wife. While it is natural for you to fear every woman being insincere, in reality, every one is not insincere. There are also many sincere people like yourself. We cannot comment on your background of choosing your wife, but in general, if proper procedures are not followed in choosing an appropriate marital partner or conducting a proper marriage, then there will be negative consequences. We advise if you intend remarrying, you should not fear. You should consult responsible people and request them to identify for you a sincere person. Enquire about the person and also make Istikhaara (seek Divine guidance) and you will be guided by Allah ? the Ultimate Guide ? Who guides to the best.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
