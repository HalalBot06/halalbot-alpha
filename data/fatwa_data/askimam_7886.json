  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFirst and foremost, we should bear in mind that all conditions are from Allah Ta?ala. Allah in His infinite wisdom knows best the reason for doing certain things. He is ultimately the Controller of all affairs. In an Aayat of the Holy Qur?aan, Allah Ta?ala says, ?He (Allah) grants whomsoever he wishes female (children) and He (Allah) grants whomsoever he wishes male (children) or he bestows both males and females and he renders barren whom he wills. Verily He is the All-knower and is able to do all things.? (Surah Shura Aayat50)\n\nAfter understanding the above and having firm conviction in it, we should continue in our efforts to get children. Continuously, make Du?aa to Allah Ta?ala to grant you offspring. Also, you may consult with a physician or specialist who may be able to assist you.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
