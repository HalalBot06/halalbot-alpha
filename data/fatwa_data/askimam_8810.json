  "answer": "QUESTION\nI want to broke the relation with my own big brother because he killed a man who was having 3 children with the help of killed person?s wife, I am in Saudi Arabia but still my big brother living in our home with my parents in India, I don?t want to talk to him, don?t want to keep any relation with him so please help me what I am going to do is right? as per ?Sharia? Please let me know early - thanks\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two issues to your query; a) Maintaining family ties, b) Murder.%0D%0A%0D%0ATo maintain family ties is an express order of Allah and His Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). To break family ties without a valid Shar?ee reason is a major sin. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?That person who breaks family ties will not enter paradise.? In another Hadith, he said, ?Allah?s mercy does not descend upon those people among whom there is a person who breaks family ties.?%0D%0A%0D%0AThe second issue is your brother?s act of committing murder which is indeed a major sin. In principle, if a person has committed a sin, he must seek repentance from Allah. If the sin is pertaining to the rights of human beings, which is the situation in enquired case, then he should seek the forgiveness of the people affected by the act, In this case, the relatives and children of the deceased. If the relatives claim their Shar?ee right for the deliberate murder, then he should fulfil that claim.%0D%0A%0D%0AShari?ah has granted the relatives of the person who was deliberately murdered Qisaas (take away the life of the murderer) in an Islamic country. You should use your influence on your brother and advise him of death, life after death and accountability in the court of Allah. Advise him to make Tawbah and fulfil the rights of the relatives of the murdered person. The punishment in the hereafter is far more serious and ghastly than the earthly punishment. You can only advise your brother by maintaining ties with him and not by breaking ties with him. If you are concerned for your brother for the pleasure of Allah and not for personal reasons, you should now endervour to save him from the wrath and anger of Allah in the hereafter.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
