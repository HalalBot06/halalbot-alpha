  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have heard from a person that who ever uses the razor to shave his beard he his using the razor on the chest of our prophet. I was told that this is a hadith. Please verify the authenticity of this hadith. Also i wanted to know that if we donot follow the Sunnahs then will we be punishable for this. I heard that if you dont offer the sunnah prayer(sunnah moaqqida) then it is not a sin because only 5 times of fard prayers were given to our prophet on miraaj. Please give a detailed answer on this. also what is the ruling if we dont follow the wajib(eg. witr namaz) and nafl. Many Thanks\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We are unable to locate any reference for such a quotation.\n\n2. Perpetual omission of Sunnat-e-Muakkadah constitutes a sin. (Shaami vol.1 pg.104; HM Saeed)\n\n3. It is necessary to perform Witr Salaat according to the Hanafi Madhab. To discard the Witr Salaat is a sin. If the Witr Salaat is not performed, Qadhaa is necessary.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
