  "question": "it's impermissble to trim beard below one fist - what is the opinion about those who want to pursue careers e.g. Law, Accounts, Doctors where it is required to dress professionally & clean shave",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI realize that it's impermissble to trim the beard below one fist and I also know that Islam does not prohibit, in fact encourages Muslims to go into different professions for the sake of dawah. Considering all of this, what is the opinion of the Ulama about Muslims who want to pursue professional careers such as being Lawyers, Accountants, Doctors, and Senior Management positions in various companies where it is generally required that everyone dresses professionally and clean shave is one of the major factors when it comes to looks? If not directly, at least indirectly they will discriminate those with unprofessional looks. It's much easier for brothers in countries such as Pakistan, but not here in Canada.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari?ah, it is compulsory to keep a beard and it is prohibited to trim it lesser than the length of one?s fist or shave it. Apart from the compulsion, keeping a beard is the Sunnah of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0AHe condemned the custom of shaving the beard which was common among the Romans and Persians. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) had a full beard almost covering his chest. He advised us, ?Go against the Christians and Jews, lengthen your beards and shorten your moustache.? It is clear from the abovementioned that it is not permissible for one to follow any trend which is un-Islamic.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe are an Ummah with different values and ideals. What may seem professional to others may be unacceptable to us. We should be firm in our Deen and Sunnah and do not be deterred by being discriminated in any way. Meet your associates with an expression of confidence in the Islamic way of life and attire. That attitude will have an impact on your associates. Ask yourself the question, who does my allegiance belong to, to Allah Ta?ala and His Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) or to the trend of time. Furthermore, there is a growing trend in the international world, Muslims and non-Muslims, keeping beard without any hindrance, especially in Canada where there is a zero tolerance policy against religious discrimination. I am well aware of many professionals in Canada wearing a Sunnah beard and Sunnah attire and go to work.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
