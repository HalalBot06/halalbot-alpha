  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nHi what type of clothes can women wear inside their homes. Also what clothes did the wives of the Prophet Mohammed (Salallahu alayhi) wasalam wear? \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nA woman in her home does not have to observe hijab as she would when she exits her home or when she is in the presence of a ghair mahram. She could remove her outer garment (jilbaab) that conceals her form and shape and she could remove her face veil (niqaab)\n\nApart from the jilbaab and niqaab, and woman may wear any clothing in her home on condition she does not wear clothing that is generally worn by evil and immoral people and she dresses with modesty.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
