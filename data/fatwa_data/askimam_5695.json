  "answer": "QUESTION\nSurah Haj 40 says worshipping places sh be protected. This favours shirk?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs Muslims, we should firstly try as far as possible to spend our wealth in%0D%0Athose avenues which could benefit the Muslims. In the different parts of the%0D%0Aworld, by us giving money to Hindu festivals, etc. we are, in fact, helping%0D%0Athem in propagating their religion. Instead of us giving our hard earned%0D%0Amoney to such avenues, which would not benefit us in this world nor in the%0D%0Ahereafter, it would be advisable that we ensure our wealth be spent in those%0D%0Aavenues which could benefit Islam, and by us giving money to Hindus we are,%0D%0Ain fact, helping the upliftment of their religion.%0D%0A%0D%0ASo, it would not be permissible for us as Muslims to give our money to%0D%0Aassist in Hindu festivals, etc. As you had mentioned they use this money for%0D%0AShirk practices. Shirk is the greatest sin on the surface of the earth. If%0D%0Awe spend our money in assisting Shirk, we are assisting the enemies of Allah%0D%0ATa'ala, which in turn causes the anger of Allah to dawn upon us.%0D%0A%0D%0AWith regarding to Nabi's (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) Salaat towards the%0D%0Aidols. This was due to certain circumstances, Islam was still in its initial%0D%0Astages and Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) had to firstly win the people'%0D%0As hearts over to Islam and once Islam was firmly rooted, the idols were%0D%0Aremoved.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
