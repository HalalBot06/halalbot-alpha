  "question": "I live in Denmark where I do not hear Adhaan. Are Adhaan and Iqamah (or one of them) obligatory for each prayer?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person offers his Salaat at home whether alone or in congregation, then both Adhaan and the Iqaamat will be Mustahabb for him on condition that\nthe Adhaan and Iqaamat of the Musjid of that area or town has already been called out. This is so because the Adhaan and Iqaamat which is Sunnat-e-Muakkadah for the area is sufficient for all the residents of that area.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
