  "question": "If one forgets to read Qanoot in the 3rd rakat of witar, how can the witar be corrected?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nQ.1: If one forgets to read Qanoot in the 3rd rakat of witar, how can the witar be corrected?\n\nQ.2: I am living in Saudi Arabia in Eastern Province. Once I went to some company's branch in Jeddah (of course passed Meeqat without Ihram) for the installion/training of a software. That company paid everything for me, like air ticket, hotel and meals etc. They booked hotel for 2 days. My intention was, in the evening when I will be free, I will take taxi and go for umrah and return by mid night, but in these couple of days, I was working almost from 7:30 AM to 9-10PM and of course tired. So I could not get time and could not perform umrah and came back. What is the ruling? This may happen in the future too. What should I do?\n\nQ.3: When, one goes from Madinah to Makkah for Umrah. The meeqat here is very close to city. Can One take ghusal and wear Ihram at hotel or home and then go to Meeqat and pray two rakats and make intention and say Labaik? Or he has to do all these things at meeqat?\n\nQ.4: We (I and my wife) perfomed umrah this Ramadan by bus (2 day trip) from Jubail City. On the return from Madinah, the driver told to pray Asar prayer after juma prayer and come to bus so that they can reach by Sat morning to the destination.(The distance between Madinah/Makkah to Eastern Province is about 1300-1400KM). We prayed two rakats of Aser prayer with the khuff of missing salat at all if he did not stop in the way. Also, we made intention that if stoped, we will pray but he actually stoped even after 30 minutes of sunset. Also one of fact is that in about 480 KM of new road from Madinah to Riyadh has no gas station to stop. They have to go outside of the highway to do a stop. What should we have done and What can we do now for that Aser salat?\n\nQ.5: Can one perform umrah before Hajj and come back or one must perform Hajj also if goes for umrah after Ramadan?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. He should just perform Sajda-e-Sahw.\n\n2. If you had intention of going to Makkah before crossing the Meeqaat, it is Waajib to tie Ihraam and perform Umrah. If you did not tie Ihraam, you have to slaughter one sheep. In future, make intention that you will go for Umrah if there is time. Then tie the Ihraam before leaving Jeddah for Makkah. (Aalamgiri pg.244)\n\n3. The actual style of Ihraam only applies once a person recites ‘labbayk’ with the intention of Ihraam, he can do any of the above things before the Meeqaat.\n\n4. Please explain this question in detail. Where did you perform this Asr Salaat?\n\n5. If Hajj is Fardh on him and he has the means to stay, then Hajj becomes Fardh on him. He can leave Makkah and come back for Hajj that year. (Ahsanul Fataawa vol.4 pg.529)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
