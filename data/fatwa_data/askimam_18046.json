  "question": "Who are the Awliyas and why do Barelwis believe they are alive in the grave?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI want to know who are the awliya and brelivis believe that they are alive in the grave??   1. can u give me proofs from quran and hadith that they arn't alive in the grave.  2. also are only nabis alive in their grave?? wht abt the truthfuls (siddiqu) and martys (shuhada) ??\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\nThe anbiyā, martyrs and close servants of Allah Ta’ala are alive in their graves. However, their life is different from the life of the living.  It is incorrect to believe that the awliyā (friends of Allah Ta’ala) have the ability to accept people’s prayers etc. It is also incorrect to ask ones needs directly from the deceased.\n\nFatāwa Mahmoodiyyah 1/539 Jamia Fārooqiyyah Karachi\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
