However, I still maintain relation with City A as follows:\n\nI still retain some of my belongings and living place there.\nMy parents are still residing at that place.\nMy wives parents live there.\n\n \n\nCan I make both cites as my watan-e-asliy?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nAnswer\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nNow city B is your Watan-e-Asli, and since you don’t have the intention of relocating to City A, it no longer remains as your Watan-e-Asli.\n\n(Fatāwa Uthmāni, Vol.1, Pg.544, Ma῾āriful Qur’ān)\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl.
