  "question": "Can you please tell me how to make a proper duwa?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n 1) Can you please tell me how to make a proper duwa?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nDuaa is a great act of Ibaadah (worship), which Allah has granted to the ummah (followers) of Nabi (S.A.W.). It is an act of Ibaadah which creates a direct link between a person and Allah. It makes a person realize that Allah is the only One who can fulfill his needs. It is for these reasons that Nabi (S.A.W.) refers to duaa as “the essence of Ibaadah” (Bukhari Shareef). Some muhaditheen explain that since duaa carries such great reward, therefore it is referred to “the essence of Ibaadah”.\n\nThe fact that Allah has made mention of duaa in the Quran is sufficient and clear evidence to prove the lofty status of duaa in our deen (religion).\n\nThe following are a few ayaat of the Quran pertaining to duaa.\n\n“And your Lord says: Make duaa (supplicate) unto me, and I will respond and accept your duaa”. (Surah Ghaafir: Ayat 60)\n\n“I respond and accept the duaa of the one who supplicates unto me”. (Surah Al Baqarah: Ayat 186)\n\n“Make duaa unto Allah with humility and secret”. (Surah Ale Imraan: Ayat 55)\n\nThere are numerous ahadith advising the ummah to engage in duaa.\n\nHereunder are a few ahadith related to the virtue and importance of duaa.\n\n“Ask Allah of His grace, because Allah loves that He be asked (i.e. that duaa be made to him)” (Tirmizhi)\n\n“There isn’t anything nobler to Allah than duaa” (Adabul-Mufrad)\n\n“Verily, Allah is modest and noble. He feels ashamed that a servant lifts up his hand in supplication and he is returned empty handed”. (Abu Dawood)\n\n“Duaa is the weapon of a believer, pillar and support of deen (Islaam) and an illumination of the skies and earth”. (Haakim)\n\n“Allah becomes angry upon the one who does not make duaa”. (Ahmed)\n\nIt is clear from the above quotes of the Quran and ahadith of Rasulullah (S.A.W.)that duaa holds a very esteemed position in Islam.\n\nFaqeeh Abu Lais Samarqandi (R.A.), a renowned scholar of fiqh of the Hanafi mazhab, has recorded a hadith with the chain of narrators leading up to Hazrat Abu Hurairah (R.A.) that the one who does five things would not be deprived of five things.\n\nThe one who expresses gratitude (shukr) to Allah for His blessings would not be deprived of increase in his blessings.\nThe one who exercises patience would not be deprived of reward.\nThe one who repents for his sins would not be deprived of the acceptance of his repentance.\nThe one who seeks forgiveness would not be deprived of forgiveness.\nThe one who makes duaa (supplicates) would not be deprived of the acceptance of his duaa.\n\nFaqeeh Abu Lais (R.A.) has recorded another hadith on the authority of Hazrat Abu Hurairah (R.A.) that Nabi (S.A.W.) has said, “There is no believer who supplicates to Allah except that his duaa is accepted, either\n\nHe is given the benefit of his duaa in this world or\nThe benefit of his duaa is kept aside for the hereafter or\nHis sins are forgiven in proportionate to the degree of his duaa.\n\nThe hadith further states that his duaa is readily accepted, as long as he leaves sinning and severing ties.\n\nIt is also necessary to know the etiquettes, manners and accepted times for duaas.\n\nConditions for acceptance of Duaa\n\nA person should make duaa with total devotion and concentration. (Musnad Ahmed- Ibn Umar (R.A.))\nHe should have certainty and conviction that Allah will accept his duaa. (Tirmizi- Abu Hurairah (R.A.))\nHe should not consume haraam. (Muslim- Abu Hurairah (R.A.))\nHe can only make duaa for those things which are permitted and acceptable in Islam. (Tirmizi- Ubaadah ibn Saamit (R.A.))\nHe should not be hasty in his duaa i.e. he shouldn’t say, “Why is Allah not accepting my duaa?” (Muslim- Abu Hurairah (R.A.))\nThe person making the duaa should be a person who is steadfast on deen (laws of Allah) or a person who has made a firm intention to rectify himself and become obedient to the commands of Allah (Surah Baqarah, Ayat 286)\nMake sure the niyyat is correct. Duaa should be solely for the pleasure of Allah.\n\nA person complained to a wise person regarding duaa. He tells the wise person, “I make duaa, but my duaa is not accepted, whereas Allah in the Quran mentions, ‘Make duaa unto me and I will accept your duaa’”. The wise person replies that there are some actions which prevent the acceptance of duaa.\n\nTo do such actions which bring about the anger of Allah, but one is not remorseful.\nTo claim to be the servant of Allah, but one does not carry out the actions of a true servant of Allah.\nOne recites the Quran, but does not practice on the injunctions of the Quran.\nOne claims to be the followers of Muhammad (S.A.W.), but does not practice on his sunnahs (teachings).\nOne claims that the world is of no value, but attaches himself to this world\nOne claims that this world will come to an end, yet his preparations seem to be forever.\nOne claims that the life of Jannah is beautiful, yet he does not strive for it.\n\nTimes when duaas are most readily accepted:\n\nDuaa at the time of Sehri (Surah Ale Imraan, Ayat 17)\nDuaa between azaan and iqaamah (Tirmizi- Anas ibn Maalik (R.A.))\nDuaa made after azaan (Abu Dawood- Sahl ibn Saad (R.A.))\nDuaa after fardh salaat (Tirmizi- Abu Umaamah Al Baahili (R.A.))\nDuaa at the time of Zawaal (midday) (Musnad Bazaar- Ayesha (R.A.))\nDuaa on the day of Arafat (Tirmizi- Abdullah ibn Amr (R.A.))\nDuaa in the month of Ramadhaan (Tabraani- Ubaada ibn Saamil (R.A.))\nDuaa on the 15th of Sha`baan (Sahih ibn Hibbaan- Mu`aaz ibn Sahal)\nDuaa upon completion of Quran (Tabraani- Irbaad ibn Saariyah)\nDuaa at the time of drinking Zam-Zam water (Haakim/Darul Qutni- Ibn Abbas (R.A.))\nDuaa on Wednesday between Zuhr and Asr (Musnad Ahmed- Jaabir (R.A.))\nDuaa on Friday at the following times:\nWhen the Imaam ascends a mimbar for the khutbah till he completes the Jummah Salaah.\nTime between Asr and Maghrib\nThe last few moments before maghrib (Sahih Muslim – Abu Hurrairah (R.A))\n\nWhose duaas are readily accepted?\n\nDuaa of an oppressed person (Tirmizi – Abu Hurrairah (R.A))\nDuaa of a fasting person at the time of Iftaar (breaking fast) (Tirmizi – Abu Hurrairah (R.A))\nDuaa of an upright and just leader. (Tirmizi – Abu Hurrairah (R.A))\nDuaa of a musaafir(Tirmizi – Abu Hurrairah (R.A))\nDuaa for your muslim brouther in his absence. (Muslim – Abu Darda (R.A))\nDuaa of a father for his child(Tirmizi – Abu Hurrairah (R.A))\nDuaa of a haji (one who has performed hajj) (Baihaqi/Haithami – Ibn Abbaas (R.A))\nDuaa of a sick person(Ibn Majah – Umar(R.A))\nDuaa of a person striving in the path of Allah. (Hakim – Ibn Abbaas (R.A))\nDuaa of a distressed person (such a person whom none can help but Allah)  (Hakim – Ayesha (R.A))\n\nEtiquettes of Duaa:\n\nMake wudhu before commencing a duaa.(Sheikh Fawaz Ahmed Zamarli)\nPerform nafl Salaah, or any act of good deed before commencing with duaa. (Sheikh Fawaz Ahmed Zamarli)\nFace the qibla at the time of making duaa.(Tirmizi – Umar (R.A))\nRaise the hands upto the chest while making duaa.(Ibn Majah – Salmaan; Musnad Ahmed – Abu Saeed (R.A))\nBegin the duaa by praising and glorifying Allah and thereafter send peace and salutations upon Rasul Allah (sallallahu alayhi wassalam). (Abu Dawood – Fudhail (R.A))\nMention the different names of Allah. (Sheikh Fawaz Ahmed Zamarli)\nMake duaa for oneself first and then for others. (Tabrani – Abu Ayub (R.A))\nWe understand from various ahadith that Rasul Allah (sallallahu alayhi wassalam) encouraged making duaa for:\nOne’s parents.\nMuslims at large.\nGaining ability to do good deeds and portray good character.\nGaining the love of Allah.\nAttaining the best of this world and hereafter.\nIncreasing one’s beneficial knowledge.\nForgiveness of all types of sins.\nSeeking refuge\n\n                                                               i.      from treachery\n\n                                                             ii.      from sickness\n\n                                                            iii.      from trials, tribulations and difficult times\n\n                                                           iv.      from an evil neighbor\n\n                                                             v.      from the plots of the enemies\n\n                                                           vi.      misguidance\n\n                                                          vii.      from all types of evils\n\nRecite “Ameen” at the end of the duaa.(Abu Misbaah – Abu Dawood)\nWipe hands over the face ant the completion of the duaa.(Bullughul Maraam – Ibn Hajr)\n\nWe make duaa that Allah makes us amongst those who remember Him abundantly and make duaa unto Him in all conditions, whether favorable or unfavorable. May Allah save us from being amongst those who only remember Him in difficulty, as Allah mentions in the Quran, “And when some affliction touches man, he cries to his lord turning to him in repentance, but when He bestows a favor upon him from himself he forgets that for which he cried for before” (Surah Zumr Verse 8)\n\nA wise person once said, “Duaa is part of piety like salt being part of food. Therefore, if we want to become close and beloved servants of Allah, it is necessary that we have the quality of making duaa in all conditions. Our focus should be towards praising Allah. Remember well! “Duaa is a weapon of a believer” (Al-Hakim)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
