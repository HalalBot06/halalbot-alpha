  "question": "salam giving salam during khutbah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe heard that we are not allowed to talk anything during khutbah. How about : 1. Replying the salam of the imam after the enter the mimbar 2. Saying amin to the dua of the imam ... 3. Between the two khutbahs?? Are these allowed ?? Will we break the jum'ah if we said these words???\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1)It is prohibited to talk, perform Salaah or read any Zikr, etc. the moment the Imaam ascends the mimbar (pulpit) to deliver the Khutba. However you may reply to the Salaam of the Imaam.\n\n2)You may say Ameen in your heart without forming any words with your lips.\n\n3)The same rule applies during the period between the two Khutbas. You should remain silent. You may make dua within the heart without movement of the lips.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
