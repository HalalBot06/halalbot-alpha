  "question": "Are there any shafi alims at darul ifta, and are there any shafi madrasas in south Africa?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI follow the shafi madhab and I was wondering are there any shafi alims at darul ifta to answer shafi fiqh questions and are there any shafi madrasas in south Africa. If so could you pleases tell me how to contact them. I also have another question, I want to become an alim but the tabligh brothers that Allah ta ala has blessed me to be with, want me to go for four months and I feel that me going out to become an alim is going to take a lot of time and a lot of study. So I want to start as soon as possible. What is your opinion ,also where should the hands be placed in salat according to shafi and should you raise your hands in the third rakat?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe refer questions relating to the Shaaf?ee Madhab to Moulana Taha Karaan. He is the Principal of Darul Uloom al-Arabiyya al-Islaamiyyah, Western Cape ? SA.\n\nTo study as well as doing Tabligh, both are important. However, Tabligh will be more effective if one has the proper Islamic education. It is our opinion that you sacrifice your time to become an Aalim. That will be beneficial for you and the Ummah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
