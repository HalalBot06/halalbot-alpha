  "question": "What can person \"A\" get punishment for in this scenario?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nwhat can person \"A\" get punishment for in this scenario?\n\n\"A\" stole money of \"B\" and died. After his death \"B\" died. Kindly U suppose that \"B\" died due to the stolen money by \"A\"(neeyat of \"A\" was not to kill \"B\").when \"B\" died at that time \"A\" was not alive. If \"B\" died due to the stolen money by \"A\" then God definitely knows that \"B\" has died due to the stolen money by \"A\" and as \"A\" is not alive so in the court of Allah( in akhirat)except the punishment of theft what other punishment \"A\" can get. For example can \"A\" also get the punishment of killing \"B\" or punishment of negligence or punishment of any other thing OR \"A\" will get only the punishment of theft? please give me your answer in detail with reason, I will be very thankful.(neeyat of \"A\" was only to steal money, his neeyat was not to kill \"B\").\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt has not been clarified in the query as to how the stealing of money was the cause of death. Therefore, a definite ruling cannot be made.\n\n \n\nHowever, hereunder is a principle:\n\nA person digs a deep hole in another’s property and someone falls into it and dies. This person will be sinful for digging a hole in another’s property; but will not get the sin of killing another person.\n\n \n\nDiyat (equivalent of ten thousand silver coins) will be compulsory upon his family.\n\n \n\nFathul Qadeer (Kitabul Jinaayaat) Vol:9 Pg:148 (Maktabah Rasheediyah)\n\nوأما القتل بسبب كحافر البئر وواضع الحجر في غير ملكه ، وموجبه إذا تلف فيه آدمي الدية على العاقلة ) ؛ لأنه سبب التلف وهو متعد فيه فأنزل موقعا دافعا فوجبت الدية ( ولا كفارة فيه ولا يتعلق به حرمان الميراث ) وقال الشافعي : يلحق بالخطإ في أحكامه ؛ لأن الشرع أنزله قاتلا ولنا أن القتل معدوم منه حقيقة فألحق به في حق الضمان فبقي في حق غيره على الأصل ، وهو إن كان يأثم بالحفر في غير ملكه لا يأثم بالموت على ما قالوا ، وهذه كفارة ذنب القتل وكذا الحرمان بسببه\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
