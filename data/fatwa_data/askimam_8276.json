  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy job is asking me to cut short my beard and lengthen my trouser (izar) below my ankle They actually don?t like the practice of such sunnah and most of the people of my country does not like the practice of most of the sunnah? Also my mom is asking me to cut short my beard and I am very worried about this tell me what do I have to do ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo trim the beard lesser that the length of one?s palm and to lower the trousers below one?s ankles is prohibited.\n\nYou should request your management to facilitate your religious beliefs. If they disagree, you should place your trust in Allah and search for an alternate employment. Be firm on the Sunnah and set an example for other Muslims to adhere to the Sunnah. If all Muslims succumb to the un-Islamic demands of employment and don?t sacrifice to adhere to the Sunnah, then who will do so?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
