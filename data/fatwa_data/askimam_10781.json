  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have 2 girls, I wish to have a baby boy, is it haram if I try the new medicals ways like splitting the sperms? And if it is a third girl at least I did my best?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala alone knows what's best for you. Accept whatever He bestows upon you with open arms. There are numerous glad tidings in the Ahadith for raising daughters. It is not permissible for you to pursue any form of treatment that may or may not offer you a chance at conceiving a male child. Such treatments are unnatural and tantamount to tampering with the creation of Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nChecked and approved:\nMl. Imran Vawda"
