  "question": "Bossa (Kiss) our parents and elders hands on eid or big days as a sign of respect?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalaam Walaikum, I wanted to ask u that can give Bossa (Kiss) our parents and elders hands on eid or big days as a sign of respect?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible to kiss ones parents out of respect.\n\nThe same rule applies for elders on condition they are Mahrams ( permantly prohibited in marriage) and there is no fear of passion and desire. It is important for us to mention this condition due to the many cases of incest common in todays society. It is also important to point out that kissing hands etc. should not be associated as part of Deen as that is Bidah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
