  "question": "I have heard in speeches that it is Sunnah with great reward if we eat our meals sitting on the floor versus a dining table. Please provide the directives of Prophet s.a.w.s. in regards to this.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn the Bayaans multiple it is generally mentioned that there are multiple Sunnahs that can be observed when one sits on the floor and eats, please list these with proper references in terms of Ahadith. It is also mentioned that there are medicinal benefits for this, please identify these with any available references.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Sunnah to sit on the floor and eat. To sit on a dinning table will be\ncontrary to Sunnah. It is narrated in a Hadith, 'Whenever food was brough to\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), he would place it on the ground.'\n(Ahmad) This is closer to humility.\n\nIt is also narrated that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) never ate\nfrom a table. (Bukhari). There are Sunnat methods of sitting on the floor.\nIt is narrated that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) should\nsometimes squat on his knees or raise his right leg and sit on his left leg\nor sit in Tashahhud position and eat. (Abu Dawud). So, this was the practice\nof Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and it is sufficient for us.\n(Ihya-ul-Uloom vol.3 pg.6)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
