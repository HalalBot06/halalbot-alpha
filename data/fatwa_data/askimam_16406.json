  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nsir i was married only for 7 months and in all that time my wife stayed with me for only 4 and half months during which time i kept her like a princess adn never treated her bad but as her parents were asking me to move to usa and live in their house with them where my wife will work and i will work too but i was not in favour of it as i live in hong kong and had a very good income and also i didnt wanted my wife to work.\n\nas a result my wife left me and when i told her that if you leave me then we may end up in divorce and she said she prefer to be diovrced that staying with me in hong kong away from her parents.\n\nshe gave birth to a premature child in usa and then she called me and first she swear at me that i was born not from my fatehr but from some other man she mentioned by name and also her father and mother said the same thing to me that my mother is a characret less woman and that she has been sleeping with other people, that time if her father was in front of me i swear on Allah that i would have killed him right away but as it was on telephone and also he said to me that i will have to give divorce to their daughter so i told him that i will give her divorce and give teh phone to her.\n\nhe said the phone is on speaker and she is listening and i said to my wife that i will gie you divorce three times but i didnt have a NIYAT for it and i didnt give her teh time when i will give her and i said three times as her father told me that you have to say three times.\n\ni know he wanted to get divorce but i told her that i will give her divorce i never said to her that i divorce her or have given to her.\n\nno she is calling and telling people taht she is divorced and her parents are gatting her married to someone else and our son is only 4 months old and i dont even know his name or anything.\n\nplease tell me if teh divorce is done or she is still my wife and since her parents only do what they say then what should i do to get my child if tehy are marrying her to someone else.\n\nan earliest reply would be very much appreciated.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\n·          The Sharée ruling herein given is specifically based on the question posed and should be read in conjunction with the question.\n\n·          The Darul Ifta bears no responsibility to any party who may or may not act on this answer. The Darul Ifta being hereby exempted from loss or damage howsoever caused.\n\n·          This answer may not be used as evidence in any Court of Law without prior written consent of the Darul Ifta.\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\nIf you said to your wife, “I will give you divorce three times” then that does not constitute divorce as it is in the future sense. If you would have uttered the words of divorce in the past or present tense, then the divorce would be valid.\n\nYour marriage with your wife is intact. She cannot get married elsewhere. If she does, that will be Zina.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
