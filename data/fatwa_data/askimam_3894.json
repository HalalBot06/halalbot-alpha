  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am so unhappy,and I believe that Allah doesnt care for me.All I want is to be happily married.Ive been making so much of dua,whenever I come across a new dua or zikr for marriage I read it.Nothing works,I dont feel like reading anymore,there is no point.These past few nights Ive been making dua for death,I know its a sin,but I cant take anymore.This loneliness is killing me.Im embarrassed to go out,all my cousins and friends are married.My parents are also embarrased by this.Why is Allah so cruel?Please help me\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs Mu'mins (believers), our Imaan (faith) is on Taqdeer. Taqdeer refers to%0D%0Athe Divine measure by Allah Ta'ala in which every creation's life is%0D%0Adesigned according to His (Allah's) infinite wisdom. The wisdom of Allah Ta'%0D%0Aala's decrees may not be comprehended by our limited understanding.%0D%0A%0D%0AThere are many who are wealthy (having the means of peace) yet at grief.%0D%0AThere are many who have children (to be the coolness of their eyes) yet at%0D%0Aagony. There are married couples (to show peace and contentment) yet leading%0D%0Amarital life of distress regretting their marriage commitment. At this stage%0D%0Aof your life, you should do two things;%0D%0Aa) Maintain your gaze on Allah Ta'ala and never despair as despondency is a%0D%0Asign of Kufr. It is possible a person makes unbecoming statements in the%0D%0Astate of despondence,%0D%0Ab) Ponder upon the lesser privileged. There are those who were married and%0D%0Adivorced after becoming victims of abuse which is common today. Listen to%0D%0Atheir agonizing incidents and that will enhance your instinct to thank Allah%0D%0ATa'ala for your condition. Our community is filled with such people.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe also advise you recite Surah Dahr in the 29 Juz as well as recite 500%0D%0Atimes Durood Shareef everyday. Our responsibility is to continue making Du'%0D%0Aaa and await Allah's decision. Despondency is certainly not a solution to%0D%0Ayour grief. May Allah Ta'ala grant you a prosperous future, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
