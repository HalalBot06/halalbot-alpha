  "question": "My cousin gave talaaq to his wife three times in succession at 1 sitting. Is this talaaq valid or does it have to be in 1 month interval. Please advice. Jazaak Allah Khair",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen a man gives his wife (conceived or not) three Talaaqs (verbally or in%0D%0Awriting) it is classified as Talaaq Mughallazah (literally meaning three%0D%0ATalaaqs; whether these Talaaqs were issued in one sitting or on different%0D%0Aoccasions), they are still valid and regarded as three.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHREE TALAAQS%0D%0A%0D%0AA Nikah is meant to last a lifetime. However at times when the marriage has, despite all efforts to save it reached a point of no return, the Shariah has permitted the dissolution of the Nikah by means of Talaaq. Nevertheless, this is the very last resort. Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) is reported to have said: \"The most detested of all permissible things is Talaaq.?%0D%0AThe most severe form of Talaaq is the issuing of three Talaaqs. This irrevocably severs the marriage, whether such Talaaq was issued over a period of time or whether in one sitting and in one breath. This is the clear ruling established from the Qur%E3n and Hadith.%0D%0A%0D%0ASome 'scholars' consider the giving of three Talaaqs in one sitting as 'one Talaaq'. As a result of this ruling, some couples that have divorced are using this 'view' to re-unite and reconcile in marriage.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt must be remembered that the Jamiat has a standing policy always to 'make a marriage - never to break it'. This depends entirely on the couple's situation and decision in their marriage. In the case where a husband confronts his wife saying, 'I divorce you, I divorce you, I divorce you', whether in one sitting or even in one breath, according to the Shari'ah three Talaaqs have taken place and the marriage is totally severed. %0D%0ABased on the Noble Qur'an and Hadith of Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam), the four most respected and distinguished scholars, viz. Imaam Shaaf'ee, Imaam Abu Hanifa, Imaam Maalik, Imaam Ahmed bin Hambal (RA) hold the view that three Talaaqs occur even when they are issued simultaneously. The discussion hereunder elaborates on this question in detail%0D%0A%0D%0A1- Allah Ta%E3la says in the Noble Qur'an: %0D%0A'Divorce is twice'. (Qur'an 2:229)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn Jalaalain Shareef, a widely accepted commentary of the Noble Qur'an, the explanation of the above verse is given as follows:%0D%0A'The divorce after which it is permissible to revoke is two (divorce)'%0D%0AIt is further stated that:%0D%0A'If the husband divorces (his wife) after two divorces then she is not Halaal for him after the third divorce'. (Jalaalain p.34)%0D%0A%0D%0A2- Explaining the above verse, Abu Bakr Jassas Razi (Rahmatullaahi %C1laihi), an expert Jurist, states in Ahkaamul Qur'an:%0D%0AIf both Talaaqs are given together, both will be effective and this is clearly indicated in the Qur'an. (Vol.1 p.387)%0D%0A%0D%0AAbu Bakr Jassas Razi (Rahmatullaahi %C1laihi) further explains: %0D%0A'(Upon issuing the third divorce), she will not be permissible for him (the husband). There is no difference whether the (divorces) were given in one Tuhr (clean period) or two different Tuhr (clean periods). The ruling will apply with regard to the issuing of all three divorces in whichever way the husband had issued them. (ibid.)%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AWhile a detailed explanation from authentic Tafaaseer could be given pertaining to three Talaaqs being effective in one sitting, in the interest of brevity, we will substantiate the same from the Ahaadith of Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)%0D%0A1- Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu)reports that when Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) heard one person giving his wife three divorces, Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) became angry and said:%0D%0A'You are making a mockery of the verses of Allah and the Deen of Allah. Whosoever gives his wife a terminating divorce, we will make three binding on him. His wife will not be Halaal for him until she does not marry another husband.'(reference)%0D%0A%0D%0AIf three Talaaqs given together were regarded as one then the Prophet (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) would not have got angry. He would not have said, 'We impose three Talaaqs on him'. He did not even ask if the Talaaqs were given in one sitting. This Hadith is clear in that three divorces given together will be three divorces and not one.%0D%0A'It is reported from Mahmood Ibn Labid that Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) was told of a person who had given his wife three divorces at once. Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) stood up in the state of anger and said, 'Are you playing with the Aayats of Allah and His Kitaab whilst I am among you.' A person stood up and said, 'Oh Rasulullah! Should I not kill him?'(reference)%0D%0A%0D%0AThis Hadith too is explicit that three Talaaqs were given together; therefore Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) got angry. If three Talaaqs were one, Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) would not have become angry. The Sahaaba also understood from Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) that three Talaaqs were valid and that is why one Sahaabi even asked for permission to kill the person who gave his wife three Talaaqs.%0D%0A%0D%0A'Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) was asked about a person who gave Talaaq three times. He remarked, 'If he had given her one or two divorces for which Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) ordered me the same. But if he had given her three Talaaqs then she is Haraam upon him until she marries another man.'REFERNCE%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the incident of Lia'an, Hadhrat Uwaymir said to the Prophet (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam), 'I have spoken a lie on her if I kept her (as my wife). Hence divorced her three times.'(reference)%0D%0A%0D%0AAbu Bakr Jassas Razi (RA) also quotes this Hadith to substantiate that three divorces in one sitting are three. This was done in the presence of Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam). The Prophet (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) acknowledged its validity as three.%0D%0A%0D%0A5- Once Imaam Hassan (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) told his wife: 'Go away, for you are divorced thrice'%0D%0AWhen he was grieved at the separation of his wife, he said:%0D%0A%0D%0A'If I had not heard my grandfather (Rasulullah) (or if my father did not tell me that he heard my grandfather) saying, 'Whosoever gives his wife three Talaaqs in the state of Tuhr (cleanliness) or three Talaaqs together, she is not Halaal for him until she does not marry another man, I would have taken her back.? (reference)%0D%0A%0D%0AThis incident reiterates the fact that three Talaaqs in one sitting is three and not one. If anyone who was worthy of any exception to the Law, it would be the illustrious grandson of Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam), Hadhrat Hassan bin Ali (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu). However, this was not the case. The rule of three Talaaqs in one sitting was binding on him too.%0D%0A%0A%0D%0ALet us now look at the view of some of the great scholars of Deen on the issue of three Talaaqs being regarded as three in one sitting.%0D%0A%0D%0A1- Imaam Bukhari's (RA) expertise in the field of Hadith is unanimously accepted. His research in the matter of three Talaaqs concludes that three Talaaqs in one sitting is three and not one. In his Sahih he titled a chapter with the following heading: 'The chapter of he who permits three Talaaqs.' He supports this title with the following Hadith: %0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Ayesha (Radhiyallaahu %C1nha) narrates that a man gave his wife three divorces. The wife remarried and (incidentally) her (second) husband divorced her. It was then asked of Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam), 'Is she Halaal for the first husband?' He (Rasulullah) replied, 'No, not until he tastes her sweetness (consummates the marriage) like how the first husband tasted her sweetness.' (Vol. 2 page 791)%0D%0A%0D%0AWith regard to the above incident Hafiz Ibn Hajar explains that the husband had given his wife three Talaaqs together. He says:%0D%0A%0D%0A'His words ?divorced thrice? explicitly indicates that (the Talaaqs) were given together.'(reference)%0D%0A%0D%0A2- Imaam Muslim (RA) (a famous student of Imaam Bukhari) also holds the same view as Imaam Bukhari (RA).%0D%0A%0D%0AImaam Nawawi (RA) writes: %0D%0A'Imaam Shaaf'ee, Imaam Maaliki, Imaam Abu Hanifa, Imaam Ahmad and all the Ulama of the past say that three Talaaqs in one sitting is three?.(reference)%0D%0A%0D%0ASome people attempt to justify their claims that three talaaqs in one sitting constitutes only one Talaaq, by citing the Hadith of Hadhrat Rukana (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu). It is claimed that Hadhrat Rukaana ibn Yazid (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) pronounced three Talaaqs in one sitting, but Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) declared that it constituted only one talaaq. However, this Hadith does not contain any clear indication that three talaaqs were issued. %0D%0A%0D%0AIn an explanation to this Hadith, Imaam Muslim quotes many narrations, which mention that Rukana (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) pronounced Talaaq Al-Battat. The word 'Al-Battat' could mean one Talaaq or three Talaaqs. This is dependent on the intention. Therefore Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) did not ask him, 'How did you pronounce the divorces?' but instead, he asked him, 'What did you intend with that?' Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)) did not even ask if he pronounced it in one sitting. The complete text of this Hadith is as follows:%0D%0A%0D%0A'Abdullah ibn Yazid ibn Rukana (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhum) reports from his father who reported from his grandfather saying: 'I came to Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) and said, \"Oh` Prophet of Allah! I pronounced Talaaq Al-Battat to my wife\". Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) asked him, \"What did you intend with that (Al-battat)\", I said, \"One (divorce)\". The Prophet (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said, \"By Allah (do you swear)?\" I said, \"By Allah (I swear).\" Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said, \"Then it is according to what you intend.\"(Muslim Shareef, Chapter on Talaaq; Tirmidhi Vol.1 p.140; Abu Daawood Vol. 1 p. 306.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf we suppose that it was a general rule that three divorces in one sitting constitutes one divorce, then why did the Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) ask him his intention. This questioning in itself indicates that there is a possibility that it could be one or three. The purpose of the questioning was definitely not to ask whether it was in one sitting or not because there is no mention of this in any Sahih Hadith.%0D%0A%0D%0AEven the great Sahaabi Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhuma) declared three talaaqs to be three. This is clearly ascertained from the following narrations.%0D%0A%0D%0AMujahid reports, 'I was in the company of Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhuma) when a man came and informed him that he had given his wife three Talaaqs. Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhuma) remained silent and we thought that he would send her back to him. Then he said; 'You walk and ride on stupidity, then you say: \"Oh` Ibn Abbaas! Oh` Ibn Abbaas!\" Allah says, \"Talaaq (after which revoking is permissible) is twice...\" You have disobeyed your Rabb and your wife is separated from you.'(Abu Daud)%0D%0A%0D%0AImaam Maalik (RA) in his Muwatta'a quotes the Fatwa of Ibn Abbaas (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhuma) as follows; %0D%0A'It has reached me (Maalik) that one person said to Ibn Abbaas, \"I divorced my wife a hundred times, what will you rule on me?\" Ibn Abbaas said, \"She is divorced from you with the first three Divorces and for the ninety-seven, you have taken the Aayats of Allah as a mockery.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the above quotation it is clear that Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhuma) gave the verdict of three Talaaqs without enquiring the manner i.e. whether given in one Majlis (sitting) and without asking about the intention of the number of Talaaqs. Hence it is absolutely clear that three divorces issued simultaneously will be effective and they will irrevocably sever the Nikah.%0D%0A%0D%0AHence Talaaq should not be treated lightly. It is a serious matter with extremely serious consequences. %0D%0A%0D%0A"
