  "question": "Between two menses, what is the minimum days between the first and second cycle when we can pray Salaat with or without bleeding?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI reviewed your questions and answers from which I found that we do not pray Salaat in the first 10 days of menses if we have more than 10 days of bleeding. My problem is that I have menstruation for 10 days, then I ghusul and then after a week, there was discharge with blood for more days. Now what should I do? Should I continue praying or does this second time count for another menses cycle not to pray Salaat? Between two menses, what is the minimum days between the first and second cycle when we can pray Salaat with or without bleeding? Do the days between menses begin as the first day of bleeding or at the end of the bleeding cycle? Sometimes I have 22 days between menses and lately I have had only 7 days and then more discharge bleeding. Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe minimum period between two menses is 15 days.\n\nAny discharge between the two menses will be regarded as Istihaadhah, which nullifies Wudhu only. In such a situation, wash, make Wudhu and perform Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
