  "question": "Now a days Jihad is Farz or what on the Muslim Ummah and Is working regularly for the State of Khilafa is necessary or what",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy Question to the Mufti Sahib is about Jihad, Now a days Jihad is Farz or what on the Muslim Ummah and Is working regularly for the State of Khilafa is necessary or what, If it is necessary then what did the rule of those People who are not Working, Plz Answer my Question on the rules of Fiqh Hanfi?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is important to take note of the following points before we answer your questions.\n\n1) The respect and dignity of the Ummah is based on correct beliefs and practices. If there is a discrepancy in correct beliefs and practices then this Ummah can never achieve the desired respect and dignity.\n\n2) Every Ummati must use his energies in exerting himself in the right direction. To exert one’s energies in the wrong direction for right cause is futile.\n\n3) What is point in working towards a Khalifah when an effort in reforming the Ummah is not conducted as required? Who will then respect the Khalifah? Who will the Khalifah control?\n\n4) One should be practical and revive a world wide reformation process of the Ummah. That can only commence if every individual reforms himself, his family and friends. Allah says \"Oh you who believe, hold firm to yourself. The deviation of others will not harm you if you’re guided.\"\n\n5) The success of this Ummah is in carrying out the basic duties of Islam, 5 daily salaah, women maintaining their chastity and good character to all Muslims and non-Muslims. This Ummah will achieve through this what is expected and desired through Khilafah. We will then be respected even by non-Muslims as was the condition of the Ummah of the past.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
