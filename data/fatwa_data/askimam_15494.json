If so, why is it necessary for you to be with them?\n\n \n\nWas it your decision to get married  and did you choose your wife yourself or was she chosen by your parents?\n\n \n\nHow old are you, your parents and your wife?\n\n \n\nIt is sad when the family gets unnecessarily tied up in knots like this. This must be a very difficult situation for you and I make dua that Allah Ta'ala makes it easy for you and the whole family. Ameen.\n\n \n\nPlease write and tell me more about your family, how many siblings you have and what work you and your parents are engaged in.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nSister Fadila\nSocial Dept.\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
