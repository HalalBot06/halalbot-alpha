  "question": "I heard it is Sunnah to keep a cat",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n over the years i often heard, that keeping a cat as a pet is sunat. is this true? my question is. .\n Is keeping a cat as a pet sunat? did Prophet Mohammed *may peace be upon him* had any pets or had a cat as a pet?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nHazrat Abu Hurairah (radiallahu anhu) is a famous Sahabi. His name Hurairah is derived from the Arabic word “Hirrah” which means cat. He was known as the “the kitten man,” literally “the father of a kitten” because he was fond of cats and since his childhood often had a cat to play with.\n\nIt is permissible to keep a cat as a pet, but this should not be considered a sunnat.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
