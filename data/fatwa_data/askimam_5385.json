  "question": "About mouth freshener and slaughtering of cow.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-O-Alaikum Warakhmatullah Respectable Mufti Sahib. I want to ask 2 questions. (1) Is the use of mouth freshener that is used to spray inside the moth to generate fragrance in the mouth is valid (legal)? (2) What is the proper method of slaughtering a cow according to sharia? Is it not like other animals e.g. goat, sheep etc? I seen a question on your site in which person is asking ?I own a leather jacket and a leather wallet. Both of these things are from the skin of a cow that was probably not slaughtered according to Sharia?. JazakAllah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The use of mouth freshners is permitted if it does not contain any\ningredient which is Haraam, e.g. alcohol, etc. To the best of our knowledge,\nmost mouth freshners or sprays do contain alcohol. It is, therefore,\nadvisable to exercise precaution when using such products.\n2. There is no difference between slaughtering a goat or a cow. Both are\nslaughtered in the same way. The method of slaughtering a cow or goat is\nthat the following has to be cut, a) throat, b) aesophagus, c) jugular vein.\n(Hidaaya vol.4 pg.437; Ashrafiyya)\n3. In principle, any skin/hide which goes through a tanning process is\nconsidered as clean and pure, even though the animal is not slaughtered\naccording to the Islamic Law of Slaughtering. (Hidaaya vol.1 pg.40; Shirka\nIlmiyya)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
