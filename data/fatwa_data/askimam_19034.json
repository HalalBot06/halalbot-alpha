This net wealth is calculated  by taking ones Gross Zakatable Wealth that has been in ones possession for a whole lunear year and deducting liabilities and debts from it. The nisab for zakat is  20 Mithqals (87.479 g) for gold and 200 Dirhams (612.35 g) for silver. In the case of long-term loans , only a year’s payment will be considered as debt.\n\n1.                  You will add your 2 lakhs on your credit card and one year’s payment on car loan. Now subtract these two amounts from 3 lakhs which is your cash in hand. If this amount is equal or more than Nisab of Zakat then 2.5% zakat will be calculated on this final amount.\n\n2.                  You should pay zakat on  (700gms of  gold 3 Lakhs – One year payment on your 25 lakhs Home Loan).\n\nIf the amount reaches the Nisab then you will calculate 2.5% of that figure and expiate that as Zakat. However if the amount is lesser than Nisab then no zakat will be liable on you.\n\n3.                  There is no zakat on land itself. Zakat has to be paid on crops whether you made profit or loss. For more details on as to how zakat on crops will be discharged, please read the 3rd part of Bahashti Zewar.\n\n(Fatawa Darul Uloom Deoband, Vol.6, Pg.57, Darul Isha’at)\n\nIn principle, the person who is discharging zakat from his wealth is liable to deduct his debt from the wealth. If you personally are responsible for that outstanding balance on the credit card then you may deduct it from your wealth. If your father was responsible for that debt, then it is the debt owed by the state. In such case, you may not deduct it from your zakatable assets.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl.
