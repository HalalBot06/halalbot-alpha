  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI want to know if I like any male person that is right or wrong? May I pray for him, Would I like to marry with him should I pray to him to Allah or not.\nEvery day I belive on Allah but I dont know why he recall on my mind.\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nAlhamdullilah, we are very pleased to see your great enthusiasm and quest to learn from the Ulama. This is a sign of Taqwa (Allah consciousness) which you perceive within yourself. We make dua to Allah Ta’ala that he increases you in Taqwa and grant you steadfastness on Deen. Ameen\n\nIt is a natural instinct of man to be inclined towards the opposite gender. When Allah Ta’ala had created Hadhrat Adam Allaihi Salaam, he was alone and he felt emptiness in his life so he asked Allah Ta’ala to create a partner for him through which he could gain peace and solace.\n\nThere is no harm in having inclination towards a male for purposes of marring him. However any type of contact with him is not permissible.\n\nWe make Dua to Allah Ta’ala that He saves you from the evils of shaitaan, and He accepts you for the service of his Deen and grants you a pious (Allah Conscious) husband, who would be the coolness of your eyes. Ameen\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl. Luqman Hansrot,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
