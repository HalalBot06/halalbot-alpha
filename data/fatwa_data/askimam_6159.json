  "answer": "QUESTION\nInshAllah once i complete matric i intend on doing Islamic Studies, not only to increase my own knowledge about Islam but also so that i can spread my knowledge to the rest of the Ummah inshAllah. Would you advise me to study at a university or at a Darul Uloom for girls or what other institute is there? the Rand Afrikaans University and UNISA offer Islamic Studies. In your opinion would you recommend i do Islamic studies at these institutes? What problems or difficulties could i face if i do Islamic Studies? Please could you comment on the Darul Ulooms for girls in general and could please provide me with a list of the Darul Ulooms and telephone numbers inshAllah. Which Darul Uloom is the best?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIslamic studies at South African universities is limited and a student is%0D%0Anot exposed to many aspects of Islamic studies that could help him%2Fher to%0D%0Aprogress in the field. However, as these institutes may teach one many%0D%0Askills but their content is limited. For content and Tarbiyah, one needs to%0D%0Alook at a Darul Uloom for Girls and a further suggestion is that while you%0D%0Aare studying at the Darul Uloom, you can register for courses at the%0D%0Auniversity via correspondence, if you are seeking an academic qualification.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe following are the list of the Darul Ulooms for Girls in South Africa:%0D%0A1.
