  "question": "Me and my wife are planning to go for hajj this year........",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1.  Me and my wife are planning to go for hajj this year, however we still have a mortgage outstanding on our home.  Is it permissable for us to go to hajj even though we will carry on paying interest on our return?\n\n2.  We are in the process of making a will in the event of our death.  We have two young children, a girl and a boy, are we allowed under islamic law to leave them equal parts of our estate? \n\n3.  We follow the hanafi madhab, can you please clarify for us whether calamari, crab, lobster and prawns are halaal or haraam.  If haraam can you please explain the reason why?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1.It is permissible to go for hajj in that state.\n\n2.According to the Islamic Law of Inheritance and Succession, a son will receive double share in relation to a daughter. It is incorrect to stipulate equal shares for a son and daughter.\n\n3.According to the Hanafi Madhab, crab is not permissible. Only fish is permissible. There are differences of opinion among the Ulama about prawns being a fish or not. In view of that, there is a leeway to eat prawns. It is Taqwa to abstain from eating anything doubtful. It is not permissible to eat lobsters and calamari as they are not considered as fish.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
