  "question": "Gambling without risking personal money.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nGambling companies sometimes send free offers (to allure) to participate in the game and get a chance to win. Absolutely no money is required for this advertisement offer. From Islamic point of view, is there any arm in participating in such offers?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two aspects to your query: a) Is it gambling or not? b) Is it\npermissible to participate in such a game?\n\nIn principle, that is not gambling. However, participating in the game, that\ndepends on the nature of the game. If there is anything un-Islamic in the\ngame, it will be prohibited even though it may not be gambling.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
