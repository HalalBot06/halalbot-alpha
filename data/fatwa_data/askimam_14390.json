  "question": "read the Holy Qur’an or the name of Allah before start any works or program which does not allow by Islam such as dance, music party, music award, cinema etc",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it allowable to read the Holy Qur’an or the name of Allah before start any works or program which does not allow by Islam such as dance, music party, music award, cinema etc.\n\nExample: Many places there is dance, there is music party and award celebration giving to the best singers female and male. I saw several TV CHANNEL or some organization they arrange annual party or celebration & before starting the program they read Holy Qur’an and after immediately they start dancing, songs, drama where ladies wearing short cloths as well as male which I believe not allowed by Islam. So why they are reading the Quran before they start that type of program. What is the punishment if it is not permissible? Thanks and Regards to All. Conclusion: If my answer is \"not permissible\" then my request to all Muslim Brother/Sister \"Pls..Don’t misguide the Islam and don’t mix the Islam in the Business which Islam does not allow at all\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is Haraam to use the Quraan for entertainment. The Quraan is the word of our Creator and Sustainer-Allah. How the word of Allah could be used as a curtain razor or some type of convenience to attract the less religious-liberal individual. The Quraan is not a story book or novel of some Kaafir author. Those who use these dubious tactics to attract audience must ponder and reflect that the Quraan is not an advertising tool for their Haraam and filthy agendas. Such practice is common at wedding ceremonies were the host of the function tries to decorate his Haraam agenda by putting a little Islamic flavour in the form of inviting an Alim/Qari to recite at the occasion. They then justify their Haraam with the recitation of the Quraan,- Al-Iyazubillah.\n\nThese are those who the Quraan curses and would argue against on the day of Judgement.\n\nThe public is hereby implored to abstain from such gatherings and never to host such functions. These gatherings invite the anger and wrath of Allah which will never yield any Barakah and blessing in the occasion.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
