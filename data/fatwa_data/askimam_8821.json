What a priceless treasure you have been granted! The entire world together with all its wealth and riches cannot match even one verse of the Qur?aan you possess in your heart. You are now becoming a special servant of Allah and a member of Allah?s family.%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, ?Verily, Allah Ta?ala, has family members among the people?, ?Who are his family?? Asked the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum). Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?The people of the Qur?aan, they are the family of Allah and His special people.? (Targhib)%0D%0A%0D%0AYou are also among the best servants of Allah. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has mentioned, ?The best amongst you is he who learns the Qur?aan and teaches it.?%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, you should remember that the higher the rank, the greater the responsibility. It is very easy to become a Haafiz but it is very difficult to remain a Haafiz. Shaytaan has taken an oath that he will lead man astray and turn them away from Allah. He, sometimes, uses evil thoughts and sometimes good thoughts to turn one away from Allah, for example, he might tempt one to steal, commit adultery, etc. and fulfil his goal and sometimes while one is involved in good, he uses good thoughts to turn him away from Allah Ta?ala. As in the case of a Haafiz, while doing Hifz, Shaytaan creates such thoughts within his mind. For example, I will not be able to uphold the title of a Haafiz or I might forget the Qur?aan for which I will be severely punished, etc. Such thoughts should be ignored and one should constantly remember the benefits and virtues of becoming a Haafiz.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs a Hafiz, one should make sure that he constantly makes Dhor. A Haafiz?s responsibility is to recite excessive Qur?aan. Thereafter, we leave it upon Allah to keep it in our hearts and minds.%0D%0A%0D%0AHow To Memorise the Qur?aan%0D%0A1. Firstly, one should make Hifz part of his daily routine. Do a little at a time but do it regularly.%0D%0A2. Choose the portion which one intends to memorise.%0D%0A3. Ask someone to read it to you from the Qur?aan.%0D%0A4. Read that portion aloud a few times.%0D%0A5. Memorise it.%0D%0A6. Read it to someone from memory.%0D%0A7. Recite the portion in your Salaat.%0D%0A8. After you have memorised it, repeat it on many occasions which will engrave it into your heart and memory.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AQari Ismail Abdul-Aziz%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN QUR?AANIC SCIENCES%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
