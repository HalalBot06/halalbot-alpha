  "question": "Is it permissable to use a toothbrush and toothpaste as well as a miswak, or is it better to use just a miswak?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was told if we use toothpaste, it means we do not have firm belief that the miswak also does the job, so I stopped using toothpaste, but I dont think I was using the miswak properly, and I felt my teeth were getting stained, so Ive started using both toothpaste and miswak. I would like to know what is more closer to taqwa. If we use toothpaste, are we defeating the purpose of the miswak?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not prohibited to use the toothbrush, toothpaste as well as the\nMiswaak.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
