  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1)  i wish to find out: if female women are allowed to cut/trim their hair to enhance growth. i'd like to grow it but it has long thin ends at bottom. are we allowed.\n 2) i have a 9 year old daughter, she is getting hair under her arms. should she remove them now or not yet but after her periods.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\nIt is permissible to trim the thin ends of the hair. However, it is not permissible to cut the hair with the intention of shortening it even though it may enhance the hair growth.\n\n \n\nIf hair has appeared under the arms, she may remove it. It is not necessary for her to wait for her periods.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
