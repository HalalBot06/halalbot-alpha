  "question": "Why is there a difference of opinion in Ulema in considering Jihad as farz-e-aein or farz-e-kifaya these days?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nJihad as farz-e-aein or farz-e-kifaya these days? In Pakistan there are many Ulema like Moulana masood azher, Mufti Rasheed Ahmed, according to whom, it is fardh-e-aein. If people or Pakistan are insufficient for Afghanistan or kashmir, of people of Palestine are insufficient or not acting for liberation, then wouldnt it be fard-e-aein on the neighboring countries?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe classification of Jihaad as Fardh-e-Ain and Fardh-e-Kifaayah is a delicate issue with major implications.\n\nSuch an issue must be discussed by a panel of leading Ulama. It is, thus, not appropriate for one person to issue a ruling by himself.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
