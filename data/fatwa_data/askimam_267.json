  "question": "The example given from Sura 59 does not mean covering the face - a cloak only covers the head/body. Correct?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe above question is in response to one of your answers about veiling the face. I have never heard of any command which says the face must be covered. One can still achieve modesty and a reduction in vanity if the face, hands and feet are permitted to be uncovered.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta√£la mentions in the Noble Qur'an, '(O Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), tell the believing males to lower their gazes? tell the believing females to lower their gazes ...' (Quran 24:29-30). The injunction of lowering the gaze is clear that it is not permissible for strange males and females to look at one another. Due to the immorality of times and weakness of resistance, it is compulsory for a female to cover her face which is the focus of her beauty. The covering of the face conveniently facilitates the accomplishment of the purpose of lowering the gaze. By Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
