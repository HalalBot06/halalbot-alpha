  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI had to inevitably take a 4 yr Bank Loan to find an accomodation in my home town. I am also working at a Software Company. My question is, since I am already paying high interest rates for my Personal Loan that I had taken, can I keep the interest earned from my Provident Fund which is comparatively low than the Interest that I have given for repayment of my loan? I completely realize that it is haram to take/give Interest(Riba). And I am sincerely working towards eliminating this haram element from my life, by not going for any more Loans. Please advise.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nAs you have correctly stated, interest is prohibited in Islam. It will not be permissible for you to utilise the interest money accrued from the provident fund in any way.  It is compulsory to distribute the interest in charity without the intention of Thawwaab.  \n\nالمحيط البرهاني للإمام برهان الدين ابن مازة - (6 / 542(\n\n والعقد الفاسد واجب الرد\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
