If is it so then can u tell me more about yoga..\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\nYoga, according to the World Book lexicon is, 'A system of Hindu religious philosophy that requires intense mental and physical discipline as a means of attaining with the universal spirit.' (World Book p. 2421). Hence even though Yoga is used only as a fitness programme, it is not permissible due to its close links with the Hindu religion.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa\n\nImportant Posts and Links\n\n \n\nShar'ii stance on Shares and Stocks|Have you prepared your WILL??|Moonsighting - Its that time to sight the moon"
