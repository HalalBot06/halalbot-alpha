  "question": "1. brothers doing masah on cotton socks and then leading the prayer - pray behind them with the intention of Nafl, but later on I repeat my salat. Is this OK ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. I have seen some brothers doing masah on cotton socks and then leading the prayer. I pray behind them with the intention of Nafl, but later on I repeat my salat. Is this OK and is it good if I inform other brothers of this person so they also repeat their prayers. 2. What do you think of Jamaat Tableegh? Shall all Muslims participate in it because for some people(even scholars), this work is bidah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is not permissible to make Masah on regular socks. The Wudhu will not be valid. This is a unanimous view of all the four Imaams, viz. Hanafi, Maaliki, Shaafi?ee, Hanbaliy ? find attached. You should discuss the matter with some brothers sharing the same view as you and form a delegation to discuss the matter with the Imaam or the Musjid Admin directly to request the Imaam to wash his feet in Salaat in order to facilitate for you and maintain unity in the community.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The fruits and results of the effort of the Tablighi brothers can be witnessed throughout the world. Indeed, it has made a tremendous impact and has changed the lives of thousands and millions of people across the globe. This can only be the results of an effort that is on Haqq (truth). This effort is in fact a revival of the efforts of the Anbiyaa (Alayhis salaam), Sahaaba Kiraam (Radhiallaahu Anhum) and our pious predecessors. We, therefore, urge and encourage every one of our Muslim brothers to spend maximum times involving ourselves in the efforts of Da?awah and Tabligh.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
