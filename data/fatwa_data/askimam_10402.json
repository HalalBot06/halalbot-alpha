  "question": "Is this shirk if someone thinks there is more than one god for one second but really its just a thought that comes to their mind and they actually believe in one allah swt. How does one repent.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaam Alikum. I have a question that is really bothering me. The other night I was listening to the 99 names of allah swt, and out of no where i had a really bad thought. It was shirk. For a split second, i thought the other gods dont like this. Even though i believe in one god. These come to me all the time, even during prayer. I quickly realized what i had thought. I got really scared so i just cried. Please tell me how I can repent and ask forgivness for Allah swt. Thanks a lot.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA believer is he/she who believes in the absolute Oneness of Allah. If one ponders upon the Powers, Greatness and Grandeur of Allah, one can never have a thought of another Allah.\n\nThe Mushrikeen did regard idols as their God and worshipped them. They were false Gods. If the thought of such false gods come to mind, and one abhors the thought of another God, then that is not Shirk. It is, in fact, a sign of one's strong Imaan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
