My wedding consisted of many celebratiosn that most Pakistani wedding nowadays consist of. Loud music, dancing, dhol playing, mehndi, manya... so many things that i am sure you know were traditions of the hindu people. Although The actual Nikkah was as is supposed to be in Islam. whitnesses and a wali. reciting from the quran e.t.c,\n\nDoes this mean that my Marriage is not valid? My father also wrote an haq mer of £500 on my behalf and my wife has still not been given this to this day. i  only recently learned that this was tha haq mer. Please advise me what i should do and if my marriage is valid?\n\nI have now been married for three years and i have a daughter who is almost 2years old\n\nJazak'Allah. May Allah (s.w.t) grant you success in this world and in the hereafter.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe guilt that is eating you for not practicing deen and not performing salah is a good sign. That is tawfeeq from Allah. Many people don’t practice on deen and do not even feel guilty. Your nafs is presently experiencing a condition of Lawwamah (reproach). It is on this condition of the nafs that Allah takes an oath on. That guilty feeling will lead you to a breaking point to exit from your sins and make tawba. Make shukr to Allah for that feeling and capitalize on that to change your life. Never lose courage. If you love yourself, you will pick yourself up and make tawba and bring a change in your life. You may consider befriending a good and pious person to inspire you to bring about a change in your life. You could also consider taking ba’yt on the hands of some spiritual guide near you. You could refer to him for spiritual guidance and motivation. Do not feel ashamed of yourself. Allah loves those who seek forgiveness and turn to Him. Your past will be non-existent in the sight of Allah with his Forgiveness.\n\nYour nikah is intact. The un-Islamic practices at the time of the nikah do not invalidate the nikah. If you did not give your wife her mehr, you should do so now. However, that to does not invalidate nikah.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalam\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
