  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaam. Recently I was having a conversation with a friend, and the issue of Afghanistan came up. In the discussion, my friend related some ahadith about signs of The Last Day. One thing he mentioned was the group of muslims who will wage a jihad, out of whom 1/3 will run away, 1/3 will become shaheed, and 1/3 will gain victory. I was wondering if the 1/3 that ran away are the current Northern Alliance (who split off after defeating the Russians) and if the 1/3 that will gain victory are the Taliban? Also, is there a hadith that says more or less that the religious leader of the time will become shaheed. Is this referring to Mullah Omar? Is it true that the Muslims will present the leaders of India in chains to Imam Mehdi? And lastly, some people predict that Imam Mehdi will appear in the Hajj of 2003. What is your opi\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Hadith in reference is authentic.\n\nHowever, we cannot comment whether the present war is being referred to in\nthe Hadith. We will have to wait until the unfolding of events before making\nany comments on the Hadith being referred to the present situation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
