  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nVarious banks offer incentives when swiping their credit cards in the form of e-bucks, air rewards, voyager miles, points that convert to cash etc. Kindly enlighten me on the permissibility of benefiting from such schemes offered.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe points earned on voyager miles etc upon swiping a credit card is in essence an incentive and bonus from the credit card company, persuading the holder to increase his usage of the credit facility. It is similar to any other bonus or incentive one may receive. We do not find anything that is un-Islamic in these schemes that are offered.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nÂ \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
