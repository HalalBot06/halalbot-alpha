  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs'salemolikum\n\n1.Please give me dua'a to get rid of bad inpure thoughts that come on very strong even when I start salaat sometimes. Most of the time it resorts back to jealousy because my Ex has remarried while I am not  divorced from him here in the USA court system yet.  Also, Islamically he never divorced me. I waited three months to file.  This has been going on since January 06.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram\n\n \n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\n \n\nThere are two types of thoughts\n\n \n\nA)    Voluntary B) involuntary\n\n \n\nOne is not responsible for involuntary thoughts. A human being experiences many things in his life. All that is stored in his mind and his heart also gets effected. These thoughts and feelings replay themselves. It is natural and one is not held responsible for thoughts beyond ones control. When one experiences such thoughts, if they are painful ones based on bad past experiences, recite Inna Lillahi Wa Inna Ilayhi Raajioon. One will get the same reward of the pain you experienced in the past. If ones evil thoughts are based on some bad habit, make Islah (reform) and understand the gravity of bad and evil habits. It distracts ones pure mind. Nevertheless, do not harbour and facilitate bad thoughts. Simply ignore such thoughts and don’t give Shaytaan an opportunity and excuse to rule you. Consider an evil and involuntary thought as an unwanted guest. If you pay attention to such a guest he will come again. If you ignore him he will disappear.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
