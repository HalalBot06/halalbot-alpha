  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan Zakat be prepaid in the sense that If a needy person wants money and I give him 4-5 times more than my year's zakat. Can I count the excess amount as my zakat for the next year and so on.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to Shariah, it is permissible to pay Zakaat in advance. However, it is important that you calculate the amount given in advance and the Zakaat due. If the amount paid in advance is less than the Zakaat due, you will have to fill in the difference.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
