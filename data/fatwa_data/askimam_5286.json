  "answer": "QUESTION\nRequest to please provide the Ahadith and other proper references from Prophet?s life. Also people recite something at the grave, and then step away about 40 ft. and recite some other supplications. Please provide all the Du?aas that need to be recited, along with the translations. Also, please point out how these orders differ for males, females, and children, and how the Du?aas differ.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe SHAR'EE method of DAFN (BURIAL).%0D%0AAfter the Janazah Salah has been performed the deceased should be buried as%0D%0Asoon as possible. The Janazah should be carried and placed at the Qiblah%0D%0Aside of the grave. The head of the deceased should be on the RIGHT side of%0D%0Athe grave if one faces the Qiblah. It is desirable that MAHRAMS or close%0D%0Arelatives (of a deceased female) should enter the grave to lower the body%0D%0Ainto it. The HUSBAND of the deceased female should not enter the grave to%0D%0Abury his WIFE. It is NOT MASNOON (Sunnat) that there be an ODD number. All%0D%0Athose who enter the grave should face the Qiblah.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is MUSTAHAB to hold a sheet over the grave while lowering and burying a%0D%0Adeceased female. If there is fear of her Kafn opening then it is WAJIB%0D%0A(compulsory) to do so.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen you lower the deceased into the grave, hold the head side and the feet%0D%0Aside, and support the back of the deceased so that the deceased does not%0D%0Abend in the middle. Pass the deceased to the people in the grave so that%0D%0Athey can lower the body to the floor of the grave. First the feet side%0D%0Ashould be laid on the ground and then the rest of the body. When lowering%0D%0Athe deceased into the grave the following Du'aa should be recited:%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0ABismillaahi wa 'alaa millat rasoolillah%0D%0A%0D%0ATrans: In the name of Allah and on the creed, religion and faith of%0D%0ARasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.%0D%0A%0D%0AAfter the deceased has been laid in the grave it is Masnoon to turn it onto%0D%0Ait's RIGHT side to face the Qiblah, put some earth below the left side of%0D%0Athe deceased body. The Strips of cloth tied at the head side, chest and feet%0D%0Aside should now be untied. The recess should be covered with unbaked bricks,%0D%0Abamboo or timber.%0D%0A%0D%0AHow the Kabr (grave) should be covered and shaped%0D%0A1. It is MUSTAHAB to begin closing the recess or trench from the LEG side%0D%0Afor MEN and from the HEAD side for WOMEN. All the remaining little openings%0D%0Ashould be closed with mud or grass. The use of any FABRIC or BLANKETS is%0D%0Aunnecessary and wasteful. All those present should participate to fill the%0D%0AKABR with at least THREE handful's of soil. When throwing the FIRST handful%0D%0Ain the KABR recite:%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0Aminhaa khalaqnaahum%0D%0A%0D%0ATrans : From the (earth) did We create you.%0D%0A%0D%0ADuring the SECOND handful:%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AWa minhaa nu'eedukum%0D%0A%0D%0ATrans: and into it shall We return you.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd the time of the THIRD handful:%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AWa minhaa nukhrijukum taaratan ukhraa%0D%0A%0D%0ATrans: and from it shall We bring you out once again.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. It is MAKROOH to add more soil to the KABR than that which was dug out%0D%0Afrom it.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. The shape of the KABR when filled should be like the HUMP of a CAMEL. The%0D%0Aheight should be approximately one and a half fist high so that it is%0D%0Alowering from the sides and leave it a little high from the middle like the%0D%0Ahump of a camel. All types of buildings and enclosures on and around the%0D%0AKabr are NOT permissible. Buildings on Kabrs have been emphatically%0D%0Adenounced in the Hadith of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. It is MUSTAHAB to sprinkle water on the Kabr from the head to feet side%0D%0Athrice after the Kabr has been filled and shaped.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. To recite the Quraan and make Dua for the deceased at his Kabr side,%0D%0Aafter the Kabr has been filled and shaped is also MUSTAHABB.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. It has been related by Hazrat UTHMAN (R.A.) that after Rasulullah%0D%0ASallallahu Alaihi Wasallam buried the dead, he paused and said; \"Beseech%0D%0Aforgiveness from Allah for your brother and make Du'aa for his steadfastness%0D%0Abecause he is going to be questioned now by the MUNKAR and NAKEER.\"%0D%0A%0D%0A7. After the burial the first Ruku of \"Suratul Bakarah\", (Alif Laam Meem%0D%0AZaalikal Kitaab to Humul Muflihoon), Should be recited at the head side of%0D%0Athe Kabr, and the last Ruku of \"Suratul Bakarah\", (Aamannar Rasoolu, till%0D%0Athe end of the Surah, Fansurna alal qaumil kaafireen), should be recited at%0D%0Athe leg side of the Kabr.%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0ASurah, Fansurna alai qaumil kaafireen), should be recited at the leg side of%0D%0Athe Kabr.%0D%0A%0D%0AGuidance:%0D%0A1. It is not permissible to leave Qur'aan Sharif, Ahadnama (book of Oath),%0D%0AGanjul Arsh or any other Dua because it contains the names of ALLAH SUBHANA%0D%0AWATALLAH and the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and owing to the dirt of%0D%0Athe deceased's body there will be disrespect. (Shami 847%2F1)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. A woman's corpse should be taken into the grave by her MAHRAM, i.e.%0D%0Agrandfather, father, father's milk-partner, brother, paternal uncle, son,%0D%0Anephew, real maternal uncle, etc. If no such person is available then either%0D%0Aany relative or any pious (religious) person may lower her into the grave.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Women must be lowered into the grave under cover. Note: Some persons try%0D%0Ato peep into the grave although there is a cover over it, this MUST NOT%0D%0AHAPPEN as it is not permissible to look at a NON-MAHRAM after death as it is%0D%0Awhen they are alive!%0D%0A%0D%0A4. It is Mustahab to sprinkle water over the Kabr once it has been filled%0D%0Awith earth. The Kabr of our beloved Prophet Sallallahu alaihi wasallam's son%0D%0AHazrat Ibrahim was watered, by our beloved Prophet Sallallahu alaihi%0D%0Awasallam. (Mishkat).%0D%0A%0D%0A5. It is Mustahab to plant a green branch of a tree on the Kabr. (Shami%0D%0A846%2F1).%0D%0A%0D%0A6. If one wants to convey the reward of one's recital of Quraan Sharif,%0D%0Acharity, Nafil Salah (Non Obligatory), fasts and good deeds, etc., then one%0D%0Ashould convey it to the virtuous soul of our beloved Prophet Sallallahu%0D%0Aalaihi wasallam, one's relatives, and all the Muslim men and women. All of%0D%0Athem will receive the same reward without any deduction; the one who has%0D%0Acarried this out will also receive the same reward without any loss. It is%0D%0Aalso valid to convey the reward to the living persons and not the dead.%0D%0A(Shami 845 part 1).%0D%0A%0D%0A7. After finishing the burial process of the deceased, it is Mustahab to%0D%0Astay there for a short while and recite a little bit of Quraan Sharif,%0D%0ADUROOD Sharif and present it to the deceased and make Dua for it's%0D%0Aforgiveness.%0D%0A%0D%0A8. It has been narrated by Hazrat Abdullah Bin Umar (R.A.) that our beloved%0D%0AProphet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam has said, \"that if anyone dies amongst%0D%0Ayou then do not keep it, send it towards the Kabr, and after burying it,%0D%0AStand before its head side and recite the first Ruku of \"Suratul Bakarah\",%0D%0Ai.e. from Alif Laam Meem Zaalikal Kitaab to Humul Muflihoon; and recite by%0D%0Ait's feet side the last Ruku of \"Suratul Bakarah\", i.e. From Aamanar rasoolu%0D%0Atill the end of the Surah, Fansuma alal qumil kaafireen. (Miskat).%0D%0A%0D%0ANote: Every brother must invocate (make Dua), with the authentic Du'aas of%0D%0AHadith Sharif after burial in order to try to convey the maximum benefit to%0D%0Athe deceased. Supplicate for the pardon of the deceased and go home and talk%0D%0Aabout patience to the deceased relatives and explain the rewards of patience%0D%0Ato them and do not let anything happen against the SHARI'AT. \"O\" ALLAH%0D%0ATALLAH bestow thy favours upon all of us to act upon thy orders and%0D%0Acommandments according to the ways of our beloved Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi%0D%0AWasallam, Amin.\""
