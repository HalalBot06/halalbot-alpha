Thereafter, all assets form part of the Nett Estate and will have\nto be distributed according to the Islamic Law of Succession and\nInheritance.\n\nYour mother's estate had to be distributed as follows: one-quarter to your\nfather, the remaining three-quarters to be distributed as: 2 shares to each\nson, 1 share to each daughter. Thereafter, when your father dies, one-eighth\nfor his new wife and the remaining seven-eighth is between you all. 2 shares\nfor the sons and 1 share for the daughters.\n\nWhatever share your father inherited from your mother will also be included\nin his estate.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
