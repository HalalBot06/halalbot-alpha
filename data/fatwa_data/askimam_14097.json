  "question": "Where I work, there is a church directly in the way of the Qiblah. How can a person get fear of Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'Ala?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhere I work, there is a church directly in the way of the Qiblah. It has big crosses on it, however it can not be seen from the room in which I pray. Is it permissible to make salaat, even the building with the crosses is in my way?\n\nHow can a person get fear of Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'Ala?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf the church comes in line with the Qiblah, the Salaat will still be valid. The intention is to face the Qibla and not the church.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
