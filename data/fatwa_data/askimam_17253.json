  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni would like to know how to pay zakaat on jewellery. Is it on the whole value of the jewellery ( workmanship etc)or only on weight of the gold/silver which is normally less in value? i have asked some Imaam in my area but i was given different views. so what mufti saheb can advise me on.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nZakaat is calculated on the weight of the gold and silver of the jewellery. The value of the workmanship is not considered in calculation of Zakat.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\nWassalam\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
