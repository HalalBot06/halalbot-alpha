  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs-salaam-alaikum Mufti-Saheb 1. What are the pre-requisites of making Dua( In the terms of Wudhu etc.) 2. I have read on the web-site that the ideal way of making Dua is while in Sajdah of a Naf'l Salaat. i have also read that it is not advisable to make dua while in sajdah of is Fardh, Waajib or Sunnat Salah. Would making Dua while in Sajdah of the Fardh, Sunnat and Waajib Salaat invalidate the salaat or should one perform Sajdah Saw to correct it. 3. I was told that one needs to have Halaal earnings to make Dua. Is this a pre-requisite for making dua ? 4. I was told that according to a ahadith the Dua of a person making Haraam income will not eb accepted is this true ? If true will the supplications of the wife, parents and children of such a person be accepted. 5. If this person who is making Haraam income is performing salaat and is a person of faith. If he stops making income from Haraam sources and repents will he be forgiven and will his dua made during the time when he was sinful be accepted. 6. I read on the website that Allah will forgive all the sins of man even if they are like the sand in the desert will the sin of Riba and Haraam earnings be forgiven too. Please reply to the questions in the numeric order. May Allah Subhannahu Taa'la increase your knowledge so that you can guide people like us (ameen). Jazak Allah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There is no stipulated prerequisite for Du'aa. It can be made at any%0D%0Atime, condition or place. However, to be in the state of Wudhu, face the%0D%0AQiblah, etc. are more likely to attract the mercy of Allah. Hence, these are%0D%0Apreferable.%0D%0A2. The Du'aas are confined to Nafl Salaats only. Refer below%0D%0A3. Yes, Halaal earning do have a direct effect on the acceptance of Du'aa.%0D%0AHence, extreme caution should be taken that only Halaal is consumed.%0D%0A4. In principle, whoever consumes such earnings, his supplication will be%0D%0Adeprived of acceptance.%0D%0A5. For this sin to be forgiven, firstly, all the Haraam wealth which was%0D%0Aaccumulated has to be taken out and returned to the rightful owner. However,%0D%0Athis is Haraam wealth accrued from interest, hence, it has to be discharged%0D%0Ain charity without any anticipation of reward.%0D%0A6. Kindly refer below.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0Afor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda %2F Mufti Muhammad Kadwa%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah is Most Gracious and Most Merciful. He says in the Noble Qur'aan, 'Oh%0D%0AMy Slaves! Do not despair. Verily Allah will forgive all sins.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIn one Hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have%0D%0Asaid, 'If a person has sins equivalent to the foams of the sea and pebbles%0D%0Aon a desert, Allah's mercy is so encompassing that He will forgive every%0D%0Asin.' In another narration, it is mentioned that Allah will speak secretly%0D%0Ato one of His slaves on the day of Qiyaamat and remind him of all his sins.%0D%0AAfter the person will confess his sins, Allah will say to him, 'I concealed%0D%0Ayour faults in the world, today too, I will conceal your faults. Go in%0D%0AJannah, I have forgiven you.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above mentioned are few of many Ahaadith explaining the extent of%0D%0AAllah's Mercy. However, Allah says, 'Verily Allah will not forgive a person%0D%0Awho ascribe partners (commit Shirk) with Him.' The only sin that is%0D%0Aunforgivable is Kufr (disbelief) and Shirk (ascribing partners). Accepting%0D%0AIslam is the only atonement for the sin of Kufr and Shirk.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf one fulfils the conditions of repentance, i.e. regret and make firm%0D%0Aintention to reform, then surely Allah Ta'ala is Tawwaab (Most Forgiving)%0D%0A"
