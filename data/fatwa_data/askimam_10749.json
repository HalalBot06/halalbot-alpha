  "answer": "QUESTION\nwhat is takbeer-e-tashreeq? whom is it compulsory upon? when and how should it be recited? please explain ASAP. Jazak'Allah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTakbeer Tashreeq is the recitation of Allahu akbar, La ilaha illa hu Wallahu akbar, Allahu akbar wa lillahil hamd after every fardh salaah commencing from the Fajr of the 9th of Dhul Hijah until after Asr of the 13th of Dhul Hijjah. (Shami vol. 1 pg. 406) When Ibrahim (AS) began moving the knife on his beloved son, Ismaeel (AS), the angels sent by Allah with a ram exclaimed. Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar (Allah is the greatest, Allah is the greatest). Ibrahim\n(AS) heard the voice of the angels and replied, La illah illa Allahu Wallahu akbar (There is no god besides Allah, and Allah is the greatest). His son Ismaeel (AS) heard this conversation and understood that Allah had relieved him from this great rial, thus he replied, Allahu Akbar Walillahil hamd (Allah is the greatest, and to Allah belongs all praise)(Ibid).\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
