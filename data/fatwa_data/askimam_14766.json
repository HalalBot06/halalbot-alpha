  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am a new muslim but before I came to islam I did a lot of bad stuff including taking money from people,I am so ashamed of my life before I became a muslim ,I ask allah to help me forget my past and bring me closer to islam.I know that Allah forgives us for our sins when we convert but am I still responsible for all the money I had taken in my past? will allah forgive me for these sins before I came to islam I cannot go to these people it will cause bad problems for me and my family and I don’t know where half these people are today please help me and let me know what I should do.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAlhamdulillah, we are very encouraged with your e-mail.  It is only honest non-Muslims who revert to Islam after knowing the truth.  You are also one of the many truthful and honest persons to embrace Islam and the truth.  You are well aware of your high and lofty status in the sight of Allah.  All your previous sins pertaining to the rights of Allah are forgiven.  Your were like a new born baby on the day you reverted to Islam.  For every act you do in Islam, you will get double reward in relation to a born muslim.  This is for your sacrifice in reverting to Islam.  You can only truly appreciate your proximity to Allah when you stand before Him on the day of Judgement. \n\nThank Allah for this great bounty of Islam and for guiding you to the truth.  To remain steadfast on Islam and fulfil the dictates of Islam is an expression of that thanks.  If you do this, Allah will make you even closer to Him and grant you from His Divine powers.  Islam places a lot of emphasis on rights.  Generally there are two types of rights in Islam. \n\nThe rights of Allah\nThe rights of the creation of Allah. \n\nThat includes human beings, animals, birds, fish etc. Every creation has a right and Islam teaches us to respect all those creations and deal with them as Allah instructed us.  Allah is powerful.  He is not in need of anyone.  If all of mankind do not fulfil the rights of Allah, that will not decrease the power of Allah in any way.  He will remain powerful as He is and was.  It is we who benefit in fulfilling the rights of Allah.  Allah bestows His mercy upon his obedient servants. \n\nAs regards the rights of the creation of Allah, if their rights are not fulfilled, they suffer a loss.  They are not like Allah.  Allah is merciful and does not bear the loss of the rights of His creation.  He emphasises on the rights of his creation.  This is a reflection of the justice of Allah and which is exemplified in Islam.  If a person does not fulfil the rights of Allah, Allah may forgive such a person but if a person usurps the rights of others. Allah will not forgive until the oppressed person himself forgives.\n\nNow, reverting to your query, if you took away peoples money, if you know where they are, you could send the money to them as a gift.  You do not have to disclose the actual reason for sending the money.  If you do not know where some people are, then give the equivalent amount in charity to the poor and needy.  That could be done over a period of time.  In this, you will be truly practising on Islam and fulfilling the monetary rights of human beings.  In this regard, all human beings are equal-Muslims and non Muslims. This exemplifies the truthfulness of Islam and the peace it stands for.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
