  "question": "Is name Hamd Bari (read as Hamd-e-Bari) a good name for a baby girl?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Sahib, Assalamu Allaikum Allah Almighty has gifted us a beautiful baby girl on Jan 28,2002 and she is now being treated for some infection right now in Neotantal ICU. First of all, we request for your prays for her health. Secondly, We have named her Hamd Bari (read as Hamd-e-Bari). Some people have mentioned to us that this can be heavy name for her, and that this may be one reason that she is in hospital right now. We wanted to ask for your wise opinion weather this seems to be a right name for a girl? Jazak Allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOne does not get ill or experience trial because of one's name. She is in\nhospital since Allah Ta'ala, in His infinite wisdom, has decided so.\n\nThis name may be kept. However, it would be better to keep a more simply\nname.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
