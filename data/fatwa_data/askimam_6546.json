  "question": "what is the purpose of iddat?why is there no iddat period for a man/husband.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIddat has a two-fold benefit, it is sanctioned to ensure that the womb is\nclear, hence, she waits for three menstrual cycles before remarrying. The\nsecond benefit is that she observes Iddat out of honour of her husband as in\nthe case of death where she observes the Iddat of 4 months and ten days.\n\nThese are just benefits or points of wisdom. The true reason only Allah\nknows.\n\nAs Muslims our commitment is submission to the orders of Allah, whether we\nunderstand the wisdom behind the order or not.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
