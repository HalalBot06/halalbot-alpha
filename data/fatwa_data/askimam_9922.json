  "question": "Is it permissible to wear a pain patch while fasting? 2)What is the term required for breastfeedingâ€¦..is it 2 years or 2 and half?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nOne of my friends has to wear a pain patch always because without the patch, she would be in a lot of pain. This patch helps her and reduces her pain because once she was attacked and because of that incident she had to take 2 operations and now the doctors have told her to wear this pain patch. She is confused about the fact that wether or not it is permissible to wear it while fasting? Some people said yes to her and some no. Could you plz answer soon because ramazan is coming and she needs to know urgent. 2)What is the term required for breastfeeding?..is it 2 years or 2 and half? And will a mother get any sin if she stops breastfeeding her child before the term appointed in Quran for no good reason (such as illness etc) but just because she simply wants to stop?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. A pain patch is used externally, hence, will not invalidate the fast. Your friend may fast in the month of Ramadhaan while using the pain patch.\n\n2. The maximum period for breastfeeding is two years. (Shaami vol.1 pg.209). There is no stipulation for the minimum. According to our understanding, mothers feed their babies solids so that the child may adapt to eating normal food. There is no harm if she stops feeding with this intention.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
