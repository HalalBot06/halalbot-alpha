How are we protected from dangers by Allah? Is it throghh angels? Or even though there are no angels in our house Allah will still protect me from dangers if He want to?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. To sell idols is not permissible, therefore you must break them just as Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) had broken the idols around the Ka?bah at the time of the Conquest of Makkah. You should not believe such suspicions that the Jinn will kill you if you break the idols. %0D%0A%0D%0A2. If there are pictures or figurines in the room or such objects are visible without any difficulty in the room, then it will be Makrooh to read Salaat in such a place. If they are small or not clearly visible, then it will be permissible to read Salaat in that place. If the carpet has pictures of inanimate objects on it then it will not be permissible to make Sajdah on it or perform Salaat on it but if you place your feet on the picture in order to disgrace such pictures, then it will be permissible. (Fataawaa ?Aalamgeeriyyah, Vol. 1, Page 107) %0D%0A%0D%0A3. The Angels of Rahmat (mercy) will not enter such a house in which there are dogs, pictures of animate objects and idols. It does not matter whether the pictures, etc small or big. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has said that no Angel will enter such a house in which there are dogs or pictures of animate objects. (Mishkaat, Babut Tasaaweer). By this we understand that only the Angels of Rahmat will not enter the house but the other Angels such as those for protection, etc will enter the house. These Angels will be everywhere, no matter where you are, be it in a good place or an evil place. Those dogs that are kept for security purposes or for hunting are not included in this Hadith. (Mazaahir-e-Haqq, Vol. 4, Page 244)%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Allah Ta?ala is the sole Protector of everyone. Everything else be they Angels, locks, etc are only a means that is used for protection purposes. This is Allah Ta?ala?s secret arrangement. Whenever he wishes to send the Angels he will do so and whenever he wishes not to, He will not send them. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Ashraf%0D%0ADarul Ifta ?
