  "question": "1. If there is a Quran in a room, should one keep their feet below that level in respect of the Quran? Or is it just prohibited to keep ones feet from facing it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n2. I usually have a back pain if standing for a while or walking too much. So if I stand really straight and walk like that to straighten my back, my chest comes out. Even though I have my scarf over it, but one can tell the shape. Should I still walk like that so my back feels good but chest comes out or should I walk slouched? 3. Tell me some zikr that I can do daily? 4. If a girl started her periods when she was 13 years of age. She didn?t punctually start reading namaaz then but started when she was 14. Does she have to make up for the missed nammaz (qazaii umri nammaz) for 1 year or 4 years, since one should start reading namaaz when 10 years old? Please clarify. 5. We usually get Urdu language newspaper and that means it might have name of muslim people with the name of Allah attached to it, like Abdallah, etc. Sometime it has articles that might have name of Allah or Muhammed (sallalahu alaihi wasallam) or Urdu translations of Qurani ayats. It is really hard to go through each page and each article to find name of Allah and cut it out. So how should you dispose these newspapers? 6. I am confused about this: Is it a biddat to do zikr or wazeefas that are not proven from hadees. Some ulamaas after Hazrat Mohammed (sallalahu alaihi wasallam) prescribe some stuff like this. Then why do some people say it is biddat to recite these duas, wazeefas, etc? Like may be, if you read this so many time something will happen or one will be safe from something.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Yes, the feet should be kept below the level of the Qur'aan as to raise%0D%0Athem above that level is disrespectful to the Qur'aan. Why don't you keep%0D%0Athe Qur'aan on a higher place instead?%0D%0A2. You may walk with your chest out. However, since the shape of your body%0D%0Ais revealed, wear a looser scarf or covering over that area. This will%0D%0Aeliminate the problem you are concerned about.%0D%0A3. Constant recitation of Istighfaar and first Kalimah. You may also recite%0D%0ADurood Shareef daily. Allocate a fixed time and start off by reciting a few%0D%0Atimes and increase daily if possible. It is better to do something little%0D%0Aconstantly instead of doing a lot occasionally.%0D%0A4. Since she became Baaligh at 13, Salaat was obligatory at 13 and not at%0D%0A10. Therefore, she should make Qadhaa of one year only and not for 4 years.%0D%0A5. You may burn them.%0D%0A6. Dhikrs and Wazeefas not mentioned in the Ahaadith are not necessarily Bid%0D%0A'at. Some Ulama prescribe the recitation of Wazeefas, etc. for certain%0D%0Abenefits based on their experiences. There is nothing wrong with reciting%0D%0Athese as they contain Du'aas, etc. addressed to Allah. You are actually%0D%0Aseeking help from Allah Ta'ala with these Du'aas. These can be likened to%0D%0Amaking Du'aa in another language.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Kadwa%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
