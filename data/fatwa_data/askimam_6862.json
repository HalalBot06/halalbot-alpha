  "question": "Taraweeh Valid with Imam reading from quran in hand?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nUnfortunatly in my community the masjid is run by the Salafies. As the month of Ramadan is quickly approaching us I have a question. In my mosque for taraweeh salat the Imam opens up the quran and reads out of the quran in his hands to lead taraweeh salat. Many of my Tablghi brothers have told me that such salat is void and that I should pray the Isha salat and go home and pray the 20 rakats of taraweeh individually. What should I do and is taraweeh really void if the imam reads out of the quran in his hand while in taraweeh salat. I feel as if I am being stripped of the reward of taraweeh due to situation in my mosque of only 8 rakats being prayed and imam reading out of the quran in his hand. May allah reward you for your help and guidance\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, it is not permissible to look into the Qur?aan and recite in Salaat.
