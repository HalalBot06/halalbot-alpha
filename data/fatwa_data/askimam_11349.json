  "question": "plz tell me if foreplay with vagina but no penetration held.can gushal compulsory",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n(1) Muftis Saab plz tell me if no thing is penetrated in vagina but only foreplay externally.can gushal make compulsory. (2) It is bidet to say Yah Rasuallah (sallahlaho alhi Wally wasalam) but my believe is that Prophet (PBUH) alive in our heart and being as a Muslim it is our first duty to love prophet (PBUH). And we say Yah Mohammed.and Yah Rasuallah (SA). Because I think Prophet (PBUH) alive in our Hearst?s, I need your supervisions belong to Al sanah wal jamat. And I thing any procedure depend on our niyat and Allah knows best who?s act is good.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If mani (semen) was emitted from her body, then Ghusl would be fard upon her, regardless of whether penetration took place or not. (Shaami Vol.1 Pg.159)\n\n2. Saying Ya Rasululah is not a bidah, however holding the belief that Nabi (sallalahu Alaihi wasallam) is omnipresent, is incorrect. Thus in principle it would be permissible to say Ya Rasululah, without the belief that Nabi (sallalahu Alaihi wasallam) is omnipresent, however on account of this being a characteristic of the Ahlul Bidah, one should refrain from it in situations were the incorrect impression could be taken. (Fatawa Rahimiyyah Vol.2 Pg. 108 to111- Jadeed)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
