  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSoldiers perform Wudhu like everyone else, there is no special method for%0D%0Asoldiers. Kindly refer attached.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE METHOD OF WUDHU%0D%0AN.B.: The person making Wudhu will be referred to as mutawad-dhi.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe mutawad-dhi should endeavour to face the qiblah while making Wudhu. It is best to sit on a raised or high place when making Wudbu in order to be out of reach of water splashing. It is far nobler and meritorious to make Wudhu by pouring water from some container, e.g. a jug. Use of a tap in Wudhu entails great waste of water, and Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) has warned against wasting water even at the river bank.%0D%0A%0D%0AMaking niyyat (intention) of Wudhu, recite (BISMILLA-HIR RAHMANIR-RAHIM). In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.%0D%0A%0D%0AFirst of all, wash both hands as far as the wrists, thrice, beginning with the right hand.%0D%0A%0D%0AThereafter rinse the mouth thrice and use a Miswaak. In the absence of a Miswaak use a coarse cloth to clean the teeth. Remember that a toothbrush is not an adequate substitute for a Miswaak. However, since the use of a cloth is in the Sunnah when a Miswaak is not available, it (cloth) could be regarded as an adequate substitute. If the toothbrush is made of bristles (pig's hairs), its use will be haraam.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf one is not fasting then gargle as well. Thereafter apply water thrice into the nostrils with the right hand and clean the nose with the little finger of the left hand. If the mutawad-dhi is fasting, water should not be drawn higher than the soft or fleshy part of the nostrils.%0D%0A%0D%0AWash then the entire face thrice. The limits of the face for Wudhu purpose is from the limits of the hair at the forehead until below the chin, and from ear to ear. Water must reach below the eyebrows as well. This is followed by making khilaal of the beard.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe right hand, including the arm and elbow, should then be washed thrice. Then wash the left hand in exactly the same manner.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis is followed by making masah of the whole head; masah of the ears; masah of the nape (i.e. back of the neck); and khilaaal of the fingers of both hands.%0D%0A%0D%0AThereafter wash the right foot, including the ankles, thrice; then wash the left foot in the same way. Make khilaal of the toes.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe perfect Wudhu requires that all the Sunnat duaa be recited at the appropriate times during Wudhu and after Wudhu. %0D%0A%0D%0AHOW TO MAKE GHUSL%0D%0AThe following is the Sunnat method of taking Ghusl. Proceed with the Ghusl, step by step, as enumerated hereunder:%0D%0A1. First wash both hands as far as the wrists. The hands should not be dipped in the basin of water for washing. Water should either run from the tap on to the hands or poured from a container.%0D%0A2. Wash the parts of istinja (the private parts and surrounding area). This should be washed whether there is najaasat (impurity) or not. %0D%0A3. Wash the part of the body wherever there be some impurity. %0D%0A4. Make a full Wudhu now. However, if Ghusl is being taken in a place where the water pools around the feet, then delay the washing of the feet until the end of the Ghusl. %0D%0A5. After Wudhu, pour water thrice over the head.%0D%0A6. Thereafter, pour water thrice over the right shoulder. %0D%0A7. Then, pour water thrice over the left shoulder. The water should be poured in such a way that the entire body is thoroughly drenched.%0D%0A8. If the feet were not washed at the time of Wudhu, wash them now. %0D%0AWhile pouring the water, rub well on the body to ensure that no spot remains dry. %0D%0A%0D%0A'A Perfect Wudhu wards off rewards from you' (Umar bin Khattab (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu))%0D%0A%0D%0AKitaabut Tahaarah%0D%0AYoung Men's Muslim Association%0D%0AActonville"
