  "question": "Does this constitute Hurmat Musaharat",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy father is aging around 85 years with weak health and average mind. He often comes across different nightmares during sleep & sometimes starts shouting. One night he entered my wife’s room in my absence and touched her on one of her thighs, room lights were on at that time. With this touch my wife waked up in shock immediately and got separated from my father without any further contact or touch.\n\n\nWhen I asked my father he said he was called in room by a woman who was seen by him in the room with 2 other women with 1 child in their lap. One of them indicated my father to touch my wife while she was sleeping. My father set aside my wife’s bed and touched her on her one thigh. Father is saying he didn’t know if it was his daughter-in-law or my wife. Neither he touched my wife considering his wife. He entered in my wife room in curiosity about those women in room which were seen by him.\n\n\nAt the time of touch, my wife was putting on cotton shalwar. She didn’t feel any Shahwat whereas I don’t know about my father Shahwat.\n\n\nSince father is very aged so he initially was saying that he didn’t have any bad intention while touching her but after 3 months he said he might have had bad intention. He is also saying that he slightly touched my wife and it was not a full touch whereas my wife is claiming of full hand touch. Father is also saying he didn’t feel any strong sexual feelings while touching; he merely touched to know who this lady might be.\n\nPlease reply in the light of Shariah if this has proved the Hurmat-e-Musaharat??\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nConsidering the fact that your father has aged and is weak, he touched your wife out of curiosity because of the vision he had seen, she was wearing a “Shalwar” at the time when he touched her, so there was no skin contact and he at first, confessed that he did not touch her having any evil intentions. Considering the above, Hurmat ul Musaaharah will not be established and your Nikaah is intact.\n\nأما الشيخ والعنين فحدها تحرك قلبه أو زيادة تحركه إن كان متحركا لا مجرد ميلان النفس فإنه يوجد فيمن لا شهوة له أصلا كالشيخ الفاني ، والمراهق كالبالغ ، حتى لو مس وأقر أنه بشهوة تثبت الحرمة عليه .\n(Fathul Qadeer vol.3 pg.129,Rasheediyyah)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
