  "answer": "QUESTION\n.Muslim man marrying a catholic woman\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for a Muslim female to marry a non-Muslim male. However, a Muslim male may marry only a Christian or Jewish female. It is not permissible for a Muslim male to marry any other non-Muslim female.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is obvious that there are many things a male can do, which is not easily possible for a female and vice versa. Islam has taken into consideration the masculine and feminine strength and weaknesses respectively. There is a possibility of the non-Muslim male due to his masculine powers convincing his Muslim wife into abandoning Islam. Therefore, Islam has considered her feminine nature and protected her correct beliefs by prohibiting her marrying a non-Muslim.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Muslim husband is not obliged to pressurise his Christian%2FJewish wife to accept Islam. He may apply wisdom and diplomacy and only influence her to Islam. %0D%0A%0D%0AIn Islam, a female is equally respected as a male, however, due to the different masculine and feminine natures, Islam believes in separation of roles.%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
