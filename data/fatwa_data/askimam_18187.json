  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. What is the estate distribution of 2 brothers and sisters?\n2. If two people went to India to wind up a property belonging to the estate, can they claim re-imbursement from the estate for their travelling expenses. They had only informed one member from each family before they left for India to resolve that property.  \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n1.)    The wealth will be divided into six equal portions and each of the two brothers will take two portions each and the two sisters will take one portion each.\n\n2.)    The two people cannot claim reimbursement from the inheritance money unless every one of the inheritors had authorized the travel for this specific purpose. If there are any individuals that are not baligh (mature) yet then even if they give permission it cannot be accepted.\n\nIf the permission is granted by all the inheritors then each inheritor will have money deducted in proportion to their specific amounts.   \n\n \n\n(Fatawa Mahmoodiya, 2/ 508, Farooqiyah)\n\n(Ahsan ul-Fatawa, 9/ 316, Saeed)\n\n(Fatawa Rahimiya, 10/ 275, 281, Isha’at)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
