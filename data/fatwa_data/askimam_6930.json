  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have been asked to explain why, since television is haraam, there is such a thing as al-Jazeera. Also, why would a wise leader like Usama bin-Laden utilize the evil tool of video tapes and television to spread his message and to train people for jihad?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTelevision will remain prohibited irrespective of who employs it as a tool of dissemination.\n\nShaykh Usaamah is not an authority of Deen as far as the laws of Deen are concerned. His actions are no proof for the validity of something. Our sources of proof are the Qur?aan and Hadith, and not the actions of leaders.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
