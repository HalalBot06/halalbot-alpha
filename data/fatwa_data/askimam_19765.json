  "question": "Was it wrong for the store manager to take the promotional items which come in various magazines?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam Walaikum,\n\n\n \nMy husband works in a company(Company A) as a Store Supervisor which sells magazines and many other things. But he does the job of the manager as the manager supervises another store and doesnot overlook the running of this one.\nSometimes the magazines haves gifts in them for the buyer (customers of company A) from advertisers. Some of the gifts are expensive or branded which normal people wouldnot be able to buy as usual. They might be hand creams, face creams, make up, nail polishes, slippers, purses etc.\n \nIf the magazine is not sold, then company A returns them to the magazine producing company (Company B) which destroys them and the gifts and provides its new issue to be sold.\n \nMy husband used to take these gifts out because they would be destroyed any ways or thrown away and give them to me. I would then use some and give others to my family and friends as gifts. I would not be able to buy these products for my self or my family/ friends if i ever had to.\n \nI have suddenly started feeling extremely worried that this might be wrong. Please tell me if it is. \n \nWhen I used to give them away, I never used to tell anyone that I had gotten these things were for free. I used to give them away as my gifts. Also another point is that Humdullilah I never used any haram products. All of these things that I used were done while in hijab. I never used to flaunt myself and I never even used to tell anyone that I used branded products. It was just that the products are better than the ones that I can afford at this time.\n \nTherefore, please tell, if these products are haram for me or not. Will this be considered as stealing? If yes what should my husband and I do now. My husband always used to get them just for my happiness. Also, What should I do with the products if they are haram for me.If I am not allowed to use these products, then what should I do with the remaining ones that I have with me. Currently, i have told my husband to stop bringing these gifts until I am clear on this. Should I throw them away? Or should i give them to charity?\n \nJazakAllah. I pray that you answer my question and may Allah always give you a reward for your efforts.\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nAsk your husband to contact the magazine company and enquire if it is alright for him to take the complimentary items.  If they agree, then you may keep the items and use them.  If they disagree, then seek the forgiveness of Allah for taking these items.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Faraz ibn Adam,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nLeicester, United Kingdom\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
