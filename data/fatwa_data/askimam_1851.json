  "question": "Tell me about undershave for men and women? and having girl friend in Islam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe area of shaving for a person (male/female) is above and around the\nprivate parts. The area immediately under the navel is not to be shaven. If\npossible, it is commendable to shave around the hind private part as well.\n(Al-Kaamil, commentary of Muslim, Imaam Nawawi, vol. 1, pg. 128)\nIslam strictly enforces the separation of sexes. All extra-marital\nrelationships are prohibited, including so called \"friendship\". Allah Ta'ala\nhas created the pure and wholesome institute of nikah to fulfill the natural\ninstincts which He has created in man and women.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best.\n\nMufti E. Desai"
