  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI alarm for Fajr Prayers but most of the time i could not wake up and i don't hear the alarm because im in deep sleep so when i wake up about 8 a.m in the morning and i know i didn't wake up for Fajr Prayer but at 10 a.m i feel active so can i offer my Fajr Prayer at 10 a.m or whenever i'm feeling active before 10 a.m.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nShariah has emphasized on performing salah on time. Allah Taala says, “Preserve your salats and (in particular) the middle salah (Asr salah)”. Preserving salah includes performing salah on time. To delay performing salah on time is a major sin.\n\nYou should endeavour to wake up on time for Fajr salah. Allah Taala does not charge us with a responsibility that we cannot execute. You should consider getting a very loud alarm clock and keep it at a distance from your bed. When it rings and disturbs you, you are forced to wake up to put it off. You should also request other members of your household to wake you up. Your friends could also telephone you and let the phone ring until you answer the phone. In essence, do whatever it takes you to wake up on time and perform your salah. If you do not reform yourself now, this habit will get worse and more difficult to change.\n\nNevertheless, if you did not perform Fajr salah on time, you should perform it as soon as you wake up provided it is not during sunrise. To perform salah during sunrise in prohibited.\n\nWassalam\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
