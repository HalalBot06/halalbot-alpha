  "question": "Is it permissible to use interest money to repair public roads?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nInterest is strictly prohibited as expressly mentioned in the Qur'aan and Ahaadith.\n\nHowever, if one uses the bank facility to keep his money, he will receive\ninterest. That amount should be disposed off by giving it away to the poor\nand needy. It is not permissible to use interest money to repair public roads.\n\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
