  "question": "1: Is a person considered sinful if he/she fails to recite/read the Qur'an at least twice every year?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nQ1: Is a person considered sinful if he/she fails to recite/read the Qur'an at least twice every year? What if a person doesn't even manage to read it once every year? Is such a person considered sinful? Q2: Will a person's fast be considered valid if he fails to abstain from sinful activities whilst fasting (such as watching TV, etc.)?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. According to Imaam Abu Hanifa [ra], it is the right of the Qur'aan to complete it twice a year - once in Ramadhaan and once in the remaining months. However, if one is unable to complete this amount, he/she will not be sinful.\n\n2. It is Makrooh to engage in any un-Islamic activity whilst fasting. Therefore, the fast will become Makrooh, not invalidated.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
