  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni want to ask that what is islams orders for taharat of muslim women after their menstrual cycle and what is the right procedure also if a women gets wet just by having some sexual thought or by seeing some explicit material or due to any reason which is beyond her control then should she take full ghusal(shower) again to get paak and the clothes she is wearing can she offer prayers in the same.because in todays environment this thing is frequent and is not under control of any women,here i would like to make this thing clear that when i say wet it does not mean having an orgasm its just they funny and tingling feeling that comes on the female.this is a very social problem and is causing lots of confusion and problems for me i hope you try to answer my question as quickly as possible\n\nthank you\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nKindly refer below our standard reply to similar queries\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nThere are two things that need to be classified.\n\na) Discharge during menses:\n\nHereunder are the different Madhaahib:\n\nMaaliki Madhab: If the discharge is pure red, yellow or brown, then the discharge will be Haydh and all the laws of Haydh will apply. Any other colour will be Istihaadha, not Haydh.\n\nShaafi’ee Madhab: If it is any one of the following five colours, pure black, red, brown, yellow and a blondish colour, then it will be Haydh. Any other other will be Istihaadha.\n\nHambali Madhab: If it is black, red, and brown, then only it will be Haydh.\n\nHanafi Madhab: If the discharge is any one of the following six colours, it will be Haydh: red, brown, green, yellow, black and a sandy colour.\n\nb) Discharge out of the menses period.\n\nIn this case, in principle, it will only nullify one’s Wudhu, irrespective of colour.\n\nWith regards to the difficulty in keeping one’s clothes clean and preventing stains, then one may simply use thin liners in order to prevent the stains as the stains are impure. Under all circumstances, one’s clothes must be clean when performing Salaat. Therefore, if this is a continuous problem and it is difficult to continuously change one’s clothes or ascertain when the discharge occurred, then a woman may use tampons. When the tampon is inserted, it will help to block off the discharge. Since the discharge will not flow out or appear on the outside but will merely be on the inner portion of the tampon, it will not nullify one’s Wudhu and not make one’s undergarment impure."
