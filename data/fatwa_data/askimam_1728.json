  "question": "What are the clearly defined functions/job descriptions of: 1) Rasools (Messengers)Nabis (Prophets).",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIt has been our learning in Madressa that every Rasul HAD to be a Nabi (Prophet) but every Nabi (Prophet) was not necessarily a Rasul (Messenger). If that learning/teaching is true then are we to understand that all Nabis (Prophets) did not have to play the role of Rasuls (Messengers)?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA rasool is a prophet who was given a new scripture. A nabi is a prophet who\nhad to follow the scripture of the previous prophet. Therefore, every rasool\nwas a nabi, but every nabi was not a rasul.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
