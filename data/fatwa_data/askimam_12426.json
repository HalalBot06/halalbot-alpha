  "question": "i have feelings for 1 of my friends and i think he has them also is there a dua i can read to make him open up and like me,i would like to marry him.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are different categories of feelings and likings. A Muslim?s feelings for another Muslim, male or female, should be based on Islamic values.\n\nIt is not appropriate for a Muslim, male or female, to have immoral and intimate feelings for another Muslim. It is also not appropriate for you as a female to have a male ?friend?. It is natural that a friend from the opposite gender will generate more than general feelings for each other that leads one to the thought of marriage and the like. Nevertheless, if you wish to marry the person, consult your family members, make Istikhaara and if all is positive, then propose to him through your senior family members. If the person is meant for you, then that will be it with the order of Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
