  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf someone while in salah gets hurt (like ankles somehow gets twisted or got hurt in any other way), what should he or she do?  Break the salah and restart after feeling at ease or should he or she continue with the hardship?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n \nIf a person suffers an injury whilst in Salah, he or she can continue the Salah in such a position that will be comfortable e.g. continuing the Salah in the sitting position (or lying position if sitting is not possible) as opposed to standing and completing the remainder of the Salah. It is more preferable for the person performing Salah to attempt completing that Salah in which he commenced in the standing position even though he completed it in the sitting position than breaking the Salah and thereafter commencing a new Salah from the sitting position.\n\n \n\n( وإن ) افتتح صلاته صحيحا و ( عرض له مرض ) فيها ( يتمها بما قدر ولو ) أتمها ( بالإيماء في المشهور ) وهو الصحيح لأن أداء بعضها بالركوع والسجود أولى من الإبطال وأدائها كلها بعده بالإيماء (مراقي الفلاح مع حاشية الطحطاوي ص 435 العلمية )\n\nHowever, if the pain is excruciating and he is forced to break the Salah, he can repeat the Salah in a sitting position or in a lying position if he cannot sit comfortably.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Yusuf bin Yaqub,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nConcurred by:\n\nMl. Ehzaz Ajmeri,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nDarul Iftaa"
