  "question": "The Ummah really needs a COMPLETE fatwa on tv so that thereafter no one can complain:",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThe Ummah really needs a COMPLETE fatwa on tv so that thereafter no one can complain:\n\n1. The issue of watching kafir tv: I know that is completely haram\n\n2. Issue of 'Muslim' tv - like a sword, it can be used for good or bad - is it same with tv?\n\n3. Is tv really picture making? I heard a fatwa of Mufti Taqi Usmani that digital camera pics are ok as long as no really hard copy pictures are printed - i.e there thus hasn't been picture 'making'. so with an image of tv - this isn't a hard copy tangible image becuase it goes away when tv off? This is the most important point in making a fatwa of tv.\n\n4. even if tv isn't picture making and thus haram in that sense, what about Allahs verse -tell believers to lower their gaze. How can people watch tv by lowering gaze? you cant control men watching only men and women watching only women. Must women equally lower their gaze to men?\n\n5. Use of tv systems for benefit - e.g security and revealing of diffuclt state of Muslims round world etc.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is totally Haraam (forbidden) to watch ‘Kafir TV’ or ‘Muslim TV’. The reason for ‘Kaafir TV’ being Haraam is obvious. Pictures of nude males and females are portrayed, music is played in the background, immoral acts are viewed and countless of other immoral acts are displayed, let alone an ordinary Muslim. Even the Kuffaar of today admit to the harms of TV and the filth that is displayed on it.\n\nMuslim TV is also Haraam because strange [non-Mahram] men and women are viewed as well as Muslim TV contains pictures of animate objects. Allah Ta’ala has commanded the men and women to lower their gazes and prohibited us from looking at the opposite gender. Allah Ta’ala states in the Qur’aan, ‘Say, O Muhammad, to the believing men that they should lower their gazes.’ Thereafter, in the next Aayat, Allah Ta’ala states, ‘Say, O Muhammad, to the believing women that they should lower their gazes.\n\nTogether with that, to produce pictures or images, be it digital or hard copy is Haraam. There is no difference regarding pictures or images portrayed on TV, digital camera or hard copy pictures. To produce such pictures and to view such pictures is totally Haraam. The argument used that the image goes away when the TV is switched off therefore, it should not be Haraam is baseless. The fact that it is an image or picture makes it Haraam. There are extremely severe warnings in the Hadith regarding picture-making.\n\n1. It is narrated on the authority of Abu Talha [radhiallaahu anhu] that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘The Malaaikah [angels] do not enter a house wherein pictures are displayed.’\n\n2. It is narrated on the authority of ibn Umar [radhiallaahu anhu] that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Those who create pictures will be punished on the day of judgment. They will be ordered to bring to life those pictures which they created.’ (Muslim Hadith5501)\n\n3. It is narrated on the authority of ibn Abbaas [radhiallaahu anhu] that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Every person who is involved in picture making will be thrown in Jahannam (hell) and each picture which he created will be brought to life and will torment this person in Jahannum.’ (Ibid)\n\n4. It is narrated on the authority of ibn Abbaas [radhiallaahu anhu] that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Whoever creates a picture of animate object in this world, he will be ordered to bring it to life whereas he will not be able to do so.’ (Ibid)\n\n5. It is narrated on the authority of ibn Mas’ood [radhiallaahu anhu] that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘People who will be given the most severe punishment on the day of judgment will be those who were involved in picture making.’ (Ibid)\n\nFrom the abovementioned narrations, the severity of the sin of picture making is clear. One should stay far away as possible from anything related to pictures. Although it may be argued that ‘Muslim TV’ holds a lot of good in it, for example, recitation of the Qur’aan, Islamic discourses and prayers being broadcasted from the holy Musjids, etc. nevertheless, there is more evil and wrong in it than good. The first evil in it is viewing pictures of animate objects which is impermissible in the Shari’ah.\n\nThe Qur’aan has laid down the general principle that that item which holds good and bad or benefit and harm and the bad is more than the good, then that item will be declared Haraam in the Shari’ah. This is the very same reason why wine was made Haraam. Wine in itself holds many benefits as well as many harms because of wine holding more evil and harm than the good it contains, it was declared Haraam in the Shari’ah.\n\nThe same law applies to ‘Muslim TV’ apparently it may seem good as it contains the recitation of the Qur’aan and Islamic discourses, etc. However, the evil of it exceeds the good by far. The first and most vile evil is the viewing of the pictures and looking at non-Mahram men and women which is flouting the commands of Allah Ta’ala. Hence, Muslim TV, which is in reality also a Kaafir TV, is prohibited in the Shari’ah.\n\nTo use TV systems for security purposes only is permissible if there is a dire need. Shari’ah relaxes the law for such necessities. As for using TV merely to learn the difficult state around the world, then this is not permissible since there is no need for a TV to learn about the difficult state of the Muslims. One can obtain information from many other sources like the internet, radio, newspaper, etc.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
