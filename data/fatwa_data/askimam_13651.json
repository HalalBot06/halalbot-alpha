  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question is related with the issue of hijab. I want to ask that in islam looking at non mehram women is either gunah-e-kabirah or saghirah as according to my little knowledge there are several ahadiths that forbade a man or woman to look at non mehram. Is it really as zina of eyes? secondly is this rule becomes more hard  when a person is dwelling in a non muslim country as in such countries women are dressed very shortly that hardly cover their private parts or even if their dress cover them is covering in the manner to show their all figures, ofcourse looking at such women could have any other result other than sexual lust ,attraction and sexual appeal  and if it is so then how can it be said that it is gunahe saghirah because it is said that gunahe saghirahs are washed only by praying five times so does this mean we don't need to have great care for avoiding such looks as they are minor sins? please clearify the issue I am greatly confused as I am living in a non muslim country.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe lowering of the gazes and not looking at the Ghayr Marham of the opposite gender is expressly mentioned in the Qur’aan. Allah Ta’ala states, ‘Say to the believing males to lower their gazes… Say to the believing females to lower their gazes.’ Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘The two eyes commit Zina and the Zina of the eyes is to cast a lustful glance.’\n\nIn principle, if one violates an express order of the Qur’aan and Hadith, it is regarded to be a major sin for which a person must make Tawbah and reform himself.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
