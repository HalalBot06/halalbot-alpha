  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am an American revert from about 3 years back. Al-Hamdulillah, Allah Subhannahu wa Ta'Ala has brought me into this deen and into the effort of deen.\n\nI am 22 years old and, insha'a Allah, am completing an IT degree here in my (smallish) home town of Fort Smith, Arkansas. I have lived here my entire life, currently living at my mom's house. My mother is also Muslim, al-Hamdulillah. There is a Masjid here, al-Hamdulillah, there are no other Tablighi brothers here. One of the most pious men I know, along with other Tablighi brothers live about an hour away in another town, completing their college degrees.\n\nWhen I converted to Islam, I became very particular in regards to deen. Different factors have contributed to my becoming very lax, fear of my family hating me (hating Islam) mostly, so I tried to 'tone it down' for their sake, now I am not as particular, may Allah forgive me and give me the highest imaan.\n\nThere are issues that, through the Rahmah of Allah Subhannahu wa Ta'Ala, I overcame when becoming Muslim, but they are creeping back into my mind. Keep me in your duas and your advice is greatly appreciated.\n\nThe condition of my imaan is terrible. My nufs is out of control and I need guidance. I would like to get in touch with a real Sufi to give me some guidance in these matters as soon as possible. Please keep me in your duas.\n\nJazakAllahu khairan\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nFirstly, you should be thankful to Allah that He gifted you Imaan. Secondly, you should be thankful that Allah has linked you to the effort of Deen. There are many people who after accepting Islam do not know how to enhance their Deeni condition. You are also very fortunate to have a Musjid in your locality. You may be the only one involved in the Tablighi activities but do not become despondent. Perhaps, Allah wants to use you to establish the A’amaal of Da’wat in your locality. There are many people who started of the same way as you and through time with steadfastness and determination, they became a means for many others to enter into the work.\n\nImaan is something which most definitely fluctuates. The ‘five Aamaal’ that have been prescribed by the elders of Da’awah is extremely important for you to keep your Imaan in check. The breakup of the five Aamaal is as follows:\n\n1. Daily, you should do three things. Firstly, Mashwarah, secondly have Ta’leem in the Musjid and at home and thirdly try to take out time to go and meet brothers in your locality.\n\n2. Weekly: the in-Ghust and the Ghust in a neighbouring locality.\n\n3. Monthly – three days.\n\n4. Annually – to go out for forty days.\n\nOver and above this, the six qualities that are spoken of, you should try to bring it into your life practically. Each point has an objective, virtue and the way to acquire it. Keeping in mind the virtue, ask yourself that are you acquiring the objective. Try to do this daily before sleeping.\n\nIt is also of vital importance that you keep in contact with the other Tablighi brothers, if not directly then telephonically. It is also of equal importance that you get into contact with a local reliable Aalim. He too will be able to assist you in your spiritual problems. Remain strong, focused, steadfast and determined and remember that after every adversity, Allah will open many roads of ease, Insha Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
