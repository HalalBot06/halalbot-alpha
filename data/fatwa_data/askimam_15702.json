  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThere is a beautiful building built; the trustees call it a jamaat khana, however Jumuah salaah takes place here. What is the difference between a Musjid and a Jamaat Khana?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThere are several differences. A Musjid has to be compulsorily Waqf, not a Jamaat Khaanah. A Jamaat Khaanah may be Waqf or private property. The space below a Musjid, as far as it goes down into the bowels of the earth, is also the Musjid. In the same way, the space above the Musjid as far as the heaven is the Musjid. The Masnoon Dua is recited when entering a Musjid, not a Jamaat Khaanah. Tahiyyatul Musjid Salaat is performed only in a Musjid, not in a Jamaat Khaanah. Entering the Musjid without ghusl is not permissible whereas this is permissible in a Jamaat Khaanah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Moosa Salie\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
