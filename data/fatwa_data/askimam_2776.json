  "question": "Must we qadha Subuh prayer though we were sleeping because we didn't realize of the azan? and if we qadha, is it accepted?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Whosoever overslept and\nmissed Salaat, should perform (the missed Salaat) when he remembers.'\n(Mishkaat)\n\nOne should make every possible effort to wake up on time to perform Fajr\nSalaat. However, if one overslept, then in view of the above mentioned\nHadith, he/she should make Qadhaa of the missed Fajr Salaat as soon as\npossible. The Qadhaa Salaat will be valid and hope to be accepted by Allah\nTa'ala.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
