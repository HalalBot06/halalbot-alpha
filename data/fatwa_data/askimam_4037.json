  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala says in the noble Qur'aan, 'And they did not kill him (Eesa -\nAlayhis salaam), neither did they place him on the cross but rather they\nwere put into a doubt.'\n\nIt is clear from the above that Eesa (Alayhis salaam) was never crucified.\nWe are aware of Ahmad Deedat opposing the concept of crucifixion.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
