  "question": "Please can u explain the following massla regarding sleepâ€¦",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti, it is stated in Nur al-Idaah that your wudu is not nullified if you sleep in such a position in which your buttocks remain firmly established on the earth. I am also aware of the ruling which states that if a person is asleep whilst leaning against an object which, if removed, would cause him to fall then this invalidates his wudu. I understand this, however further on in Nur al-Idaah it says : (under the chapter explaining those situations which do not nullify wudu) , \" One whose buttocks are established upon the earth even though he is leaning upon an object which, if removed, would cause him to fall.\" I would like to know the meaning of this because to me this sentence means that even if I am sleeping quite comfortably in a sitting position on a settee/ reclining chair my wudu is still intact. Yet I am v. sure that my understanding is quite deficient. The ref for the above quotation is: Mahmood. Z. (2000) The Book Of Tahara, Leicester, Inter-Islam Publishing company. (p.36)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person is sleeping while reclining and his buttocks are firm on the\nground, then there are two opinions regarding his Wudhu.\n\nThe correct opinion is that his Wudhu does not break as also indicated in\nNurul Idhaah with the words 'Alaz zaahir feehima.' The preferred view is\nexpressly stated in the Haashia (footnotes) of Nurul Idhaah pg.36, Qadeemi.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
