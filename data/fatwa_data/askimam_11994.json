Allah knows they are innocent but we family at back home is so helpless and don?t know what to do anymore , on every hearing they give them further remand , we are trying our level best to dua for their safety inside and get them out from that misery/jail asap but Hukum of their release isn?t coming from Allah. On every hearing we are so hopeful of Allaahs mercy but we get very discorraged and disappointed when we hear their further remand though a month has been passed they r not able to bringup any evidence against them in court and judge himself said manytimes if by not brought any proof by next hearing will b release but judge keep giving further remand dono why, in a weeks time their hearing is coming again. Allaah is the only one who can make this happen but all says its very very difficult but my yaqeen in Allaah He is able to do anything anytime if He wills but so far my dua has not been accepted and I don?t know what to do anymore? Pls Dua for us DESPERATLY NEEDED IT that Allah may grant us relief this time and relase my family members from their custody on this hearing and bring them back home safely inshallaah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nContinuously read \"Allaahummaa innaa Najaluka fi Nuhoorihim Wa Na'oozubika Min Shuroorihim\" (Abu Dawud Hadith No.1537)\n\nRemember that conditions come from Allah to test us and to see if these conditions will make us turn to Allah, repent and resolve to bring our lives onto the obedience of Allah and onto following the sunnah of Nabi (sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) May Allah make it easy for you and clear up your sorrow and rescue your loved ones.Amin\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
