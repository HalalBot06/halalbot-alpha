  "question": "If there is ijma on fistful length beard,why do many contemporary Shafi and Maliki ulema have very short beards and have also given fatwa on the permissibility of such?JazaakAllahu Khair",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe rulings of contempory Ulama do not effect the ijma (consensus) of the\nillustrious Fuqaha. Imam Malik (RA), Imam Shafi (RA), Imam Ahmed ibn Hambal\n(RA), and Imam Abu Hanifa (RA) on keeping a fistful length beard.\nFurthermore, it is the responsibility of the Ulama to encourage people\ntowards the sunnah of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), as well as every prophet of Allah had a full\nbeard. To issue a fatwa contrary to the practise and sunnah of Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) contravenes the prime responsibility of the\nUlama - practising and promoting the mubarak sunnah of Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
