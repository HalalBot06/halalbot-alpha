  "question": "When there is clear evidence from another madhabs can someone follow that opinion if it is not an opinion of your own madhab?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen there is clear evidence from another madhabs can someone follow that opinion if it is not an opinion of your own madhab? (example) If some one following the hanafi madhab recited fatiha behind an imam in zuhr salat and asr salat would his salat be invalid even though evidence shows that it is correct? Or if someone wanted to make extra takbirs in salat could they ? and if not what did the four imams say about only following the evidence of their madhabs? If it is all sunnah and the ulama all agrees that all schools of fiqh are correct why cant hanafis do any of them. If you could elaborate on these questions that would be great. What kind of talim did they have in masjid nabi ( SAW) What is the best way to develop khusu and khudu in salah? Can a hanafi perform witr more than one way like make salams in second rakat and make the last rakat with qunoot and could you give me a hadith with evidence that rasulullah (saw) placed his hands back under his navel while reciting qunoot?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. All the Madhabs are based on solid proofs from the Qur?aan and Ahadith. It is not permissible for a follower of one Madhab to leave his Madhab and follow an opinion of another Madhab even if he is aware of the proof of the other Madhab and cannot find evidence for his Madhab. (Durrul Muhtaar vol.3 pg.210)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Ta?leem in the Musjid of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was not restricted to any specific topic. The laws of Islam, Qur?aan and Ahaadith, virtues of actions, etc. were all taught. A number of different groups were formed, each allocated to their respective teacher. (See Hayaatus-sahaabah vol.3 pg.153-228; Darul Qalaam)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. To develop concentration in Salaat, one should keep one?s gaze at the place of Sajdah whilst in the standing position, between the feet whilst in Ruku, on one?s nose whilst in Sajdah and on the thighs while in the Tashahhud position.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. It is not correct for a Hanafi to make Salaam after 2 Rakaats of Witr Salaat. (Fataawa Raheemiyyah vol.6 pg.415)%0D%0A%0D%0A5. It has been narrated by Waail ibn Hujr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) that would grasp his left hand with his right hand below his navel. Allaamah Qaasim ibn Qutloobugha (RA) comments on this Hadith saying, ?It?s chain of narrators is good.? (refer Dishamus Suraah pg.40; Idaratul Quraan)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
