  "question": "If someone has non Muslim parents are the rules the same as having Muslim parents in regards to being obedient to them?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI know that one should love and respect there parents but most often non Muslim parents do not know enough about deen to really know what is best for you. Could you please tell me how someone can be respectful of to ones non Muslim parents without sacrificing what?s good for your iman and good for your deen, and how can one balance the two? And what takes precedence , doing good amals and spending time in the company of good Muslim and making salat with jammat or 100% obedience to parents even when it prevents you from making salat in jammat. Should someone take advice from a pious muslim over the advice of non Muslims parents. Could you please elaborate on all the questions asked. Also will it be permissible to visit and make salat in kufah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Qur?aan and Ahaadith are replete with orders and advices of being obedient to one?s parents. Allah Ta?ala states, ?And worship Allah and do not ascribe any partner to Him and be favourable to parents.? (Banu Israaeel)%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Paradise lies under the feet of the mothers.? Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?The pleasure of Allah lies in the pleasure of the father and the displeasure of Allah lies in the displeasure of the father.? It is clear from the above quotations that one should respect their parents and be favourable to them. The ruling is general. It includes parents who are Muslims as well as non-Muslims. Hadhrat Asma (Radhiallaahu Anha) states that her mother was a non-Muslim and came to visit her, she enquired from Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) if she can enjoin ties with her non-Muslim mother. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) replied, ?Yes?. (Bukhari vol.2)%0D%0A%0D%0AMaintaining ties with non-Muslim parents or relatives presents one with an ideal situation to convey the etiquettes of Islam in a practical way. That is the most effective way of Da?awah. If one wins the confidence of a person, generally, he can make whatever he wants of the person. It is also important to point out that in dealing with non-Muslim parents or relatives, one must not compromise in one?s Islamic values and principles. %0D%0A%0D%0AIt is incorrect to obey anyone against the orders of Allah Ta?ala. To perform Salaat with Jamaat is compulsory. It is not appropriate to discard that to be with one?s parents. However, circumstances of need are different which grant leniency and leeways. One may also seek advice from one?s non-Muslim parents relating to worldly issues. Obviously, their advices will be motivated with love for their child. There is no specific virtue to travel to Kufa and perform Salaat there.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
