  "question": "Is it true that the deobandis believe that the Prophet(saws) used to visit Mulla Qasim Nanatowi to learn urdu and to check the accounts of the madrasah? (Haqaiq-o-Maarif, Deoband May 1975)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamau alaikum Mufti sahib. please comment on the above taken from a deobandi source. Also please comment, if possible on http://www.allaahuakbar.net/tableegi_jamaat/exposition.htm and http://www.allaahuakbar.net/tableegi_jamaat/see_the_truth_with_your_own_eyes.htm. JazakAllahu khairan. Wa Assalamu alaikum.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe do not have a copy of the book, Haqaaiq-o-Maarif. If our memory serves us well, the incident refers to a dream.\n\nMoulana Qasim Nanotwi (RA) saw in a dream that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) had visited the Madrasah. One is not responsible for one?s dreams, nor can a ruling be given on the basis of dreams. Even if a person sees the worst of scenarios in a dream, we cannot say that such a person is evil. Similarly, if an evil person sees a pious dream, it does not make him pious.\n\nDo excuse us, but we do not have the time to visit the said website. Time only allows us to give brief answers to questions. If you have confidence in these mischief makers, then you are at liberty to take them as your guides. The loss will be yours.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
