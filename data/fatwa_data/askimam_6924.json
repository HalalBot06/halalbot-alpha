The above three Tasbeehaat should be read in isolation and concentration.%0D%0A%0D%0Ad. Always display good character even in front of one?s enemies. %0D%0A%0D%0Ae. Avoid intermingling with the opposite gender and lower one?s gaze. Do not let the mind and heart be polluted with the form and shape of the opposite gender.
