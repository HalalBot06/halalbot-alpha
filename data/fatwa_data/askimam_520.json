  "answer": "QUESTION\nOn a number of occaisions a man has said this 'Aahge rarr hosain ya parr' (ie: 'today you will be either on this side or the other') to his wife, when he has been angry. When questioned, after his anger had subsided, as to what he meant by this, he said 'you know'.He has since left his wife (has been over a year). Their baby daughter has been very ill at times, and he has not bothered to contact his wife.What is the ruling to this situation?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe statement, 'I might divorce you .' does not constitute a divorce. We\nsuggest the wife request the assistance of some senior and influential\npeople to discuss the matter with her husband and amicably resolve the\nproblem.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
