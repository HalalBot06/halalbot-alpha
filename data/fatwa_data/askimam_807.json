  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat if one muslim only believes in Allah and his messenger,regularly thinks about Allah, reads namaz, gives zakat, fasts, introduces others to Islam, always talks about Islam to non-muslims about how it is the one and only Religion and passes on Knowledge,influences others to stop doing bad but does not drink or smoke, or backbite but listens to english or urdu music. Will he/she still have a bad punishment and enter hell? If yes what type of punishment is it?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Sister-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Álaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nListening to Music is a sin. In principle, one should make Tawbah (repent) from the sin.\n\nIf a person did not make Tawbah, if Allah wills, he will forgive the person or may punish the person. We have not come across any specific punishment on the day of Qiyaamat for the sin of listening to music.\n\nAnd Allah Taãla Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
