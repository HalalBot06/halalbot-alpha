  "question": "Please give me the meaning of the name Hafsa? What is the natural way to avoid pregnancy?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Hafsa was the name of the wife of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]\n\n2. It will not be permissible to avoid pregnancy because of fear of poverty. Children and pregnancy are a great favour and bounty of Allah Ta?ala. Many people desire for pregnancy and children but Allah Ta?ala does not intend that for them. It will be allowed to avoid pregnancy in certain circumstances, e.g. mother fears death or severe sickness if she falls pregnant. In this instance, she can use contraceptives or any other method, but it should be understood that if Allah wills, the woman will still fall pregnant.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
