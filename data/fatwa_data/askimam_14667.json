  "question": "Ramazan and Eid-ul-Fitr are celebrated on different days even in the same town",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsslamoalikum! We live in a small town of England.I've 2 questions (1) First is about the way Holy Ramazan and Eid-ul-Fitr are celebrated on different days even in the same town.We have two groups of thoughts \"Deoband\" and \"Brailevi\" in our town.Both groups start ramazan on different days, one group follows Saudi Arabia and other say we are too far from Saudi Arabia so they start one day later, they claim we see moon here in uk.Now some people started Ramadan on 23 sep06 and others started on 24th sep06. Now PLEASE can you explain who is doing RIGHT and who is WRONG? Definately one group is wrong, because in the same town it is impossible to have so big difference of one day. if its wrong, then is the whole responsibilty comes on our \"Imamas\" of the masjids and masjid-committee?because we follow our masjids in which we usually read nimaaz, and we are confused who is right or wrong? We will have Eid on different day.We are having different ODD nights of last Ashra of Ramadan, even we are confused about LAILA-TUL-QADAR both groups having on different days. Is all this right or wrong?Imam Sahib,could you please take a bit long time and explain this matter in depth, may ALLAH gives us the HIDAYAT (aamine). Second question is, Can one person touch his own wife's body and kiss her breasts during Fast? Does fast break if one do so? My third question is about `Keena`.There is no doubt that to have keena or Bughz about any muslim is not acceptable in Islam. I want to ask if parents of somebody have not good relations with any of their relative,and they don’t want their sons to speak to them people, then what sort of behaviour should sons show to that relative? Should they obey their parennts in this situation and stop meeting and talking to the person? as if parents ask sons to do so? Thank you very much\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\n \n\n1)      Unfortunately the Saudi’s have grievously erred in their commencement of Ramadhan. Their criteria of moon sighting and commencement of the lunar month is incorrect. If it not correct for the people outside , to follow Saudi’s announcement of the beginning of the month, Eid Ul Fitr and Eid Ul Adha. There has been a significant change in the . Many Masjid’s and committee’s have realized the wrong of following Saudi Arabia and have changed to local sighting or following countries close to them that decide based on the sighting of the crescent. I urge all imams, trustees of their Masjid to do the correct thing. You are the leaders and you will be sinful if you are silent in such a blatant wrong or you lead the people to the wrong path. Fear Allah and not your members and constituencies. A detailed article on the wrongs of Saudi sighting is pasted elsewhere on this site and on the link site. Many Masjids in South London have united by following local sighting and this is well appreciated by their masses.\n\n \n\n2)      If the person is young and he will not be able to contain his passion and desires, then it will be prohibited for such a person to kiss or play intimately with his wife during fasting.\n\n \n\n3)      The children should not obey their parents in this regard. Family ties is Fardh as is the express order of Allah. The parents cannot advice their children to break family ties. They should in fact encourage family ties and lead by example.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nThe ask imam site will not process questions from October 23 till October 27. You may forward your observations about the site.\n\n \n\nContact the Imam of Croydon Masjid and Islamic Centre for all the talks of Mufti Ebrahim Desai conducted through radio Ramadhan Croydon and Croydon Masjid and Islamic Centre 525 London road, Thornton Heath Croydon, Surry, CR7 6AR\n\n \n\nHappy Eid Mubarak to you\n\n \n\nMay Allah accept your ibadat in Ramadhan and grant us all His pleasure and Jannah (Aameen)"
