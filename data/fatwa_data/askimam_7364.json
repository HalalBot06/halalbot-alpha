  "question": "Could you kindly inform me of the significance of salaatul Jummah and why it is held only on fridays.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Salaatul Jumu?ah is referred to as Jaamiul-Jamaat (gatherer of all the various Jamaats). It brings about more closeness and unity within the ranks of the Muslims. It is a great day, a day of Eid and a great day deserves a special form of Ibaadah. Hence, the Salaat of Jumu?ah. (refer attached)\n\n2. It is held on Fridays because this is how it has been transcribed to us by our Deen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
