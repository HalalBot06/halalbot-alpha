  "question": "When making Duâ€™aa to Allah S.W.T., is it preferred to go in Sajda? If allowed, can the palms face up, or does one have to follow the Faraid of Sajda? What are the obligations of Sajda?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease quote the related Ahadith, and the Faraid (obligations) of Sajda.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo fulfil an act according to the Sunnah is the most effective way of\nQubooliyyah (acceptance) of the act in the sight of Allah. Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to make Du'aa in the Sajda of the Nafl\nSalaat. The palms would be on the ground in line with the ears. The back of\nthe palm will be faced towards the sky only in Salaatul Istisqaa (when\nseeking rain).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
