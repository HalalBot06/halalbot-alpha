  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)What is the difference between a Molana, Molvi, Ulama and a Mufti? 2)Are there any other religious scholars which I haven?t stated if so please state? 3)What is the order of their status? 4)I know that reward in Paradise will be much greater so is there any method which I could read/perform to get divine virgins to serve me in paradise? 5)Can you tell me something to read which is easy to utter but weighty in reward? Jazakallahu Khairun\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1-3. Moulana and molvi are titles given to an ?Aalim (plural of which is Ulama), a learned person. There is no difference in their specialities. The words moulana and molvi are derived from the word Moulaa which means master or leader. A Mufti however is of a higher status who has the authority to deliver Shari legal opinion.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. There is no specific action or Du?aa that can be recited in order to attain the services of the Hoors (divine virgins) in Paradise. When a person dies with Imaan and righteous deeds he will be admitted into Paradise in which whatever he desires will be presented to him, which includes the Hoors. %0D%0A%0D%0A5. Abu Hurairah (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said: ?There are two statements that are light on the tongue (to remember), weighty on the scales and are dear to the Most Merciful, (they are) Subhaanallahi wa bi hamdihi, Subhaanallahil ?Azeem.
