  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIts been almost 2 years that i have been facing these problems:\n\n1.after passing urine i press my stomach and the underside so that all the remaining urine drops will go out, but when i come out and while making wudoo or while making sujood they come out.\n\n2.and even during the rest of the day small quantities keep coming out so i put a tissue paper to absorb it that keeps my clothes clean but the rest of my organ becomes dirty(the penis and the ball sack).and so wash my whole penis and ball sack before making wudoo before every Salah and it is very tiresome.\n\n3.it takes me about 25 to30 min to make my self pure and make wudoo.\n\n4.most of the time i dont even feel anything comming out of my penis but before wudoo when check my underwear i find a very small amount of impurity there.\n\nsir this problem has been haunting me for a very long time now and i sometimes get very depressed i keep thinking if Allah is accepting my Salah.\n\nthe most agonising thing about it is that i have to wash my self 5 to 6 times daily sir plz give me a practical solution because i am also a university student and my studies are being effected by my deppression.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThe discharge of droplets of urine after urination is usually due to not performing proper Istibra. Istibra is a process that ensures that all of the droplets of urine are purged from the urethra. There are several practices that will assist a person in relieving himself of this problem. The first practice is to urinate in the crouched sitting position and not while standing. Secondly, once the urination has ended, the remaining drops in the urethra have to be purged out. This can be done by forcing yourself to cough whereby the convulsions of your body force out the remaining drops. Another way is to place toilet paper on your private part and take several steps whereby the urine drops leak out onto the toilet paper. However, the best and the most tried and tested method is as follows:\n\nAfter urinating from the sitting position, use the middle finger and / or index finger of your left hand and press upon the urethra starting from between the scrotum and the anus moving forward towards the penis orifice purging any urine drops. After repeating this process several times, wash the private part as you would normally do whilst making Istinja and thereafter make sure to dry the private part with toilet paper.\n\nAs an extra precautionary method, one can place a wad of toilet paper in his underpants to absorb any leftover droplets of urine. One should only commence performing Wudhu after feeling assured that no more drops of urine will come out. Before, performing Salah the toilet paper should be removed or replaced with clean toilet paper.\n\nBy applying the above mentioned methods of Istibra, insha-Allah, your problem would be solved\n\n( كما ) ينقض ( لو حشا إحليله بقطنة وابتل الطرف الظاهر ) هذا لو القطنة عالية أو محاذية لرأس الإحليل وإن متسفلة عنه لا ينقض وكذا الحكم في الدبر والفرج الداخل ( وإن ابتل ) الطرف الداخل لا  ينقض\n\n(Al Durul Mukhtar Vol1, Pg 148)\n\n(Fatawa Mahmoodiya Vol7, Pg 564)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
