  "question": "What is meant by Ma'rifat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is meant by marifat? i was told by my friend that there are other stages in islam above shariat, is that true if so can you briefly tell us what are they and also refer some websites where we can read and know about them\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nShariah refers to the laws of Islam which are primarily based on the Quran and Hadith. \n\nMa’rifat means the recognition and consciousness of Allah Taala. If a person is conscious of Allah Taala, he will abide by the laws of Shariah.\n\nOne can strengthen his ma’rifat through tazkiyah, that is, purifying ones soul from evils. To stay in the company of a pious person is an effective way of gaining Ma’rifat of Allah Taala.\n\nYou may read further on the topic at :\n\nhttp://tasawwuf.daralmahmood.org/ \n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
