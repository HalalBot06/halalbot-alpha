  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam U Aalaikum. (i) I have been regularly visiting your site. In many cases where either of the spouses have committed zina you have advised them to seek forgiveness but not to disclose the same to the other partner. Don?t you think that hiding such a big truth is itself a big vice. (2) In many Islamic countries where corrupt governments rule the land like that of Pakistan and when one knows that the contribution of one's zakat will go to finance the wines and women for the government officials is it not better to avoid giving them any zakat and pay the same amount to some one else directly who really deserves it. (3) In Pakistan medical students are shown pictures of body parts, movies and are also asked to dissect the dead bodies. Is learning through all these permissible (4) males and females jointly see other sex?s dead body parts, and (4) how will their income be characterized from this (halal?)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. This is based on the following: Firstly, Shariah has commanded us to hide sins, to such an extent that Allah Ta'ala hates one who commits a sin in secret and then informs others of it. Secondly, Nikah is extremly sacred and important, while divorce is absolutely detested, thus we do our utmost to preserve the nikah and avoid divorce.%0D%0A%0D%0AYes, we realize that zina is a severe breach of trust and that the husband should be informed under normal conditions, as his right has been trampled upon. However where fear exists of the husband divorcing the wife or even resorting to more severe measures, we have advised the wife to hide the zina, thus preventing the terrible outcome. Proof for it can be found in the practice of Hazrat Umar (Radhiallahu anhu) where he prevented the wife's family from informing the husbands family of fornication committed by the wife.(Hayaatus Sahabah Vol.3 Pg.157-Salafiyyah)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. If the zakaat is not being distributed correctly, then a person should distribute it himself.%0D%0A%0D%0A3 & 4. Seeing the awrah (private parts) of another person is not permissible neither is it permissible to dissect dead bodies. The income earned by a doctor who studied in this manner would be permissible.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMl.
