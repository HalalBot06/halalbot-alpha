  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. Can we store childrens cloths to show them when they grow up? ....\n\n2. Can we watch old movies, series from chanels?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf parents have purchased the clothing with their money, they can do as they wish with the clothing. If the clothing have been purchased with the children’s money which was given to them as gifts etc, then the parents may purchase the clothing and keep them. The money of the clothing should be used for the children.\nIt is not permissible to watch any movies.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
