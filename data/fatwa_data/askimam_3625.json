  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Sahib, I am in a crisis. Atleast it is a crisis for me. I am a woman who tries her level best to stay away from family gossips etc. It makes me upset, depressed and disturbed. Apparantly, my husband's older sister, has caused utmost problems by being extrememly nosy and by arguing with my parents-in-law, which in turn, makes my husband upset and which basically ends up making me feel disturbed as well. My in-laws live with us therefore, whenever there is an argument over the phone when my sister-in-law calls, it makes my family's atmosphere sour. I have a toddler and I hate to see that my child has to see her grandparents getting all upset with their daughter's problems.. petty problems. I do not want to get involved in their affairs nor do I want my child seeing this. Mufti Sahib, could you please offer me some sort of guidance, in light of our Islamic teachings, on how to handle this situation?? I would really appreciate your help. I would hate to interfere in my in-laws and my sister-in-law's problems. PLEASE HELP.

Apart from the above%0D%0Aadvise, in view of your situation, we offer the following advices:%0D%0A1. Since you are living with your in-laws, try not to get involved in their%0D%0Apersonal matters.
