  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am going to be married to a muslim man who is already married.  What i want to know and shy to ask him, is ,if three of us will get involved. What i mean by that is, can he ask us  both to be in bed with him. Is that one of his rights?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nThe laws of Satar (exposing of private parts) are relaxed between a man and his wives however, such laws are not relaxed between the co-wives. Hence, it is not permissible to have intercourse with more than one wife at the same time, due to the satar being exposed between the co-wives. Furthermore, the husband cannot argue this as one of his right’s nor do the wives’ need to obey him on this aspect.\n\n \n\n(Raddul Muhtaar, Vol.6, Pg.371, HM Saeed)[1]\n\n(Bahishti Zewar, Pg.347, Zam Zam)\n\n(Ftaawa Mahmudiyyah, Vol.19, Pg.239, Faruqiyah)\n\n(Al Hindiyyah, Vol.5, Pg.327, Rasheediyah)\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\nMl.
