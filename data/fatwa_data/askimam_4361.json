  "question": "Will Allah forgive one who apostatizes from and blasphemes Islam, and then repents? What must happen for such a person to rejoin the ummah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAbout a year ago I, being young and arrogant, declared myself an atheist. I became involved with a group of atheists online, and I shamelessly blasphemed Allah (swt), Islam, the holy Qur'an, Muhammad (saw), and his companions (ra) in the most disgusting and perverse manner. I did everything I could think of to ridicule Islam in their and my own eyes. I wish only to forget the abominable things I wrote. I can blame nobody but myself for it. Nobody led me astray. It was I who sought out evil books and ideas and unbelieving friends, and I who decided to pursue them to my ruin. Yes, blasphemy against all religions is extremely widespread in this country (the United States), but I have no excuse. I know that such things render one a riddah and a kafir, which deserve death. I know I deserve nothing better than hellfire, and in fact I am terrified at the prospect, yet I pray earnestly that Allah will forgive me my apostasy. I do not deserve to be called a Muslim sister; I do not deserve to be greeted with \"Asalaamu alaikum.\" I am too ashamed to go to the masjid, even though nobody else knows of my deeds. I say Shahada with my whole heart every day, and I pray and fast, but I do not know if Allah (swt) will accept these things from me. What shall I do to repent?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah is Most Gracious and Most Merciful. He says in the Noble Qur'aan, 'Oh%0D%0AMy Slaves! Do not despair. Verily Allah will forgive all sins.'%0D%0AIn one Hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have%0D%0Asaid, 'If a person has sins equivalent to the foams of the sea and pebbles%0D%0Aon a desert, Allah's mercy is so encompassing that He will forgive every%0D%0Asin.' In another narration, it is mentioned that Allah will speak secretly%0D%0Ato one of His slaves on the day of Qiyaamat and remind him of all his sins.%0D%0AAfter the person will confess his sins, Allah will say to him, 'I concealed%0D%0Ayour faults in the world, today too, I will conceal your faults. Go in%0D%0AJannah, I have forgiven you.'%0D%0AThe above mentioned are few of many Ahaadith explaining the extent of%0D%0AAllah's Mercy. However, Allah says, 'Verily Allah will not forgive a person%0D%0Awho ascribe partners (commit Shirk) with Him.' The only sin that is%0D%0Aunforgivable is Kufr (disbelief) and Shirk (ascribing partners). Accepting%0D%0AIslam is the only atonement for the sin of Kufr and Shirk.%0D%0AIf one fulfils the conditions of repentance, i.e. regret and make firm%0D%0Aintention to reform, then surely Allah Ta'ala is Tawwaab (Most Forgiving)%0D%0A%0D%0ASister your regret is a sincere sign of your repentance. There were many%0D%0Apeople, men and women, who made derogative statements against Islam and the%0D%0AProphet during the time of the Prophet. When they repented they were%0D%0Aforgiven. The Quran says, Do not despair, I (Allah) will forgive every sin%0D%0Abesides shirk.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
