  "answer": "QUESTION\nI believe that da'wah is a responsibility of every muslim, and I encounter many non-muslims on campus. My quesion is about making da'wah to women(I'm a guy). I speak to women all the time, just like most brothers (even those who don't come to varsity and work in their parents' shops instead). Is this in line with shariah? Just about all of these women are deemed to be very decent and modest by western standards, but obviously do not wear hijaab.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two aspects to this query; Da'awah to non-Muslims and Da'awah to%0D%0Athe opposite gender.%0D%0A%0D%0AAt the outset, you should understand well that Da'awah is the responsibility%0D%0Aof every single Muslim. It is one of the most effective tools of inviting to%0D%0ADeen. Nevertheless, nowadays, it is a known fact that generally Muslims have%0D%0Adrifted far away from Deen. Muslims have changed their priorities of Deen to%0D%0Amaterial glitters of their temporary life. Therefore, in order to first%0D%0Aequip us with Islamic values and principles, the Ulama have looked into the%0D%0Alife of Rasulullah [Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam] and concluded that Da'awah%0D%0Ato Muslims was always a priority over non-Muslims.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the opening verses of Surah Abasa, Allah Ta'ala emphasised to Nabi%0D%0A[Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] that you should always give preference to%0D%0AMuslims over non-Muslims. We should not be deceived by Shaytaan in giving Da%0D%0A'awah to the opposite gender. According to the Shari'ah, it is Haraam%0D%0A(prohibited) to have any contact with strange (non-Mahram) women, even%0D%0Athough it may be for Da'awah purposes. There are many women in South Africa%0D%0Awho are well versed in the Shari'ah. You should use a Mahram to refer them%0D%0Ato these people.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
