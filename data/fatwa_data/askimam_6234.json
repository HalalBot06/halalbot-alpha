  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs It permissble TO Keep Dogs Not Inside the House But at the Back of The House.Is cats permissible ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAll creatures are the creation of Almighty Allah and deserve the recognition of being a creation of the Almighty. As much as Muslims detest even the sight of a pig, it is nonetheless the creation of Allah; and because Allah has placed life into it, we cannot inflict pain nor torture a pig. Similarly Almighty Allah has created the dog from among His creations. This does not mean that we should have love for the dog. It is perhaps the indoctrination of the Western culture that ‘the dog is a man’s best friend’. Also, the theory that dogs are very dependent on human affection is a myth, again aided by culture and custom to develop this unnatural behavior. Almighty Allah - the Creator of the Universe - having created the dog would surely have known that the dog requires human affection and love in order to exist in this world. The Prophet of Allah salallahu ῾alayhi wasallam would have advised us Muslims to keep dogs as pets. On the contrary we are instructed not to keep dogs as pets and not to have love for them.  Remember our life is structured and bounded by the Shari‘ah i.e., the Noble Qur’ān and the beautiful example of the Prophet salallahu ῾alayhi wasallam. Consider the following narrations of the Prophet salallahu ῾alayhi wasallam:\n\n•    Sayyidunā Abū Talha radiallahu anhu reports that The Prophet of Allah salallahu ῾alayhi wasallam said, “Angels do not enter a house wherein there is a dog or an animate picture.” - Sahīh Bukhārī, hadīth no. 2986\n\n•    Sayyidunā Ibn ‘Abbas radiallahu anhu reports from Sayyidunā Maymūnah radiallahu anha that once The Prophet of Allah salallahu ῾alayhi wasallam became sad and said, “Jibra’īl alayhi salam promised to meet me at night but did not come. By Allah what has kept him back.” He then realized a puppy was under his bed. He ordered that the puppy be removed and the area be sprinkled with water. In the afternoon when Jibra’īl alayhi salam came, The Prophet alayhi salam enquired as to the delay. Jibra’īl alayhi salam replied, “we, the group of Angels, do not enter a house wherein there is a dog or pictures.” Sahīh Muslim, Hadīth no.3928    \n\nIn the light of these narrations and other narrations it is not permissible to keep dogs as pets. The household is deprived of the Mercy of Almighty Allah. However Jurists have stated that it is permissible to keep a dog for security purposes, farming, and hunting.\n\nIt should also be noted, that the saliva of a dog is considered to be impure. If it touches the clothes or body that portion also becomes impure and must be washed."
