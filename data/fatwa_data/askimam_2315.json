  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have small \"Cactus Tree's\" in my garden, I am told that I should remove them immediately. The reason for this is the Jews will hide behind these tree's and therefore we should nor grow these trees. May the Almighty Allah reward you and all organisations and individuals working towards Deen.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not necessary to remove the cactus trees from your garden. The Hadith\nrefers to a thorny tree that will assist the Jews. It does not specify which\nthorny tree.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
