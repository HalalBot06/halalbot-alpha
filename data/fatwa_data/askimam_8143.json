  "question": "I am a graduate of an Islamic seminary and a great admirer of Maulana Maududi’s scholarship. Why don’t you accord him the same courtesy that you extend to Imam Taymiyah ...?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have following question to ask you: Your group opposses Maulana Maududi with tooth and nail. However, I have come across many learned men from different parts of the Muslim world, including several Deobandi scholars, who consider Maulana Maududi as an eminent ?Alim and Mujaddid of his time. Why don?t you accord him the same courtesy that you extend to Imam Taymiyah in these words? ?Shaykh Taqi-u-ddin Ahmad ibn Taymiyah was a prominent Aalim (scholar) of Deen. Shaykh Taqi-u-ddin had his independent views on many matters based on his vast knowledge and research. It is incorrect for non-scholars and non-academics to pass a judgment especially on such learned people. They should fear Allah and abstain from engaging themselves in such discussions. Differences of opinion is a salient feature among the Ulama-e-Haqq (true scholars).? What you say about Imam Taymiyah is hundred percent true for Imam Maududi as well. I look forward to your response.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou compare Maududi to Shaykh Taqi-u-ddin Ahmad ibn Taymiyah (RA).\n\nSurely, you must have some basis for your comparison, probably, their academic achievements, etc. Kindly forward that for me to consider your 100% claim to be of any merit.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
