  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)I read somewhere that we are not allowed to marry our first cousins(or that it should be avoided), does this have any basis in the Shariah? 2)If someone is fasting and eats something unintentionally, should the onlooker tell him that he's fasting or should the onlooker just remain quite?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. You are allowed to marry your first cousin. There is absolutely nothing wrong in this.\n\n2. If the fasting person is weak and you feel that he won?t be able to manage the remainder of the fast, you may remain silent otherwise you should tell him that he is fasting.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
