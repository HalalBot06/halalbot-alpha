  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe are planning to construct a house, we got three plans for it, many engineers are non Muslims at our place. They have a terminology called \"vastu\" when we approached three of the engineers they have similar kind of plan. But I don't want to believe as it is non-muslim act. I would like to know what is the correct ways according to Quran to plan and construct a house. The engineers are also telling that not to construct house on a cross land(mean not perfectly square) advising us to give it free to others. It would be helpful for us, As we have not started the construction yet and looking for a right answer in light of islam. Jazakallah Mohammed Azeemuddin.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is nothing wrong in seeking the service and advice of the non-Muslim engineers. Their advice is based on their skills and profession, not on religion.\n\nIf you are doubtful, you should make Mashwara (consult) with your seniors and also make Istikhaara before deciding.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
