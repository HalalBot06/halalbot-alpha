  "question": "What are the steps for a newly converted person for marrying a Muslim girl?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWe have a man who got converted lately to Islam, and now he wants to marry a muslim girl who works with him, what are the steps for a newly converted person for marrying a muslim girl, will she just trust him and accept him, he is showing lots of sincerity but what to do?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe Islam of the man is encouraging. However, the girl should exercise precaution in marriage. She could consult her seniors and discuss the issue of trust, marriage etc with them. She should also make Istikhara. The simple guideline is, never commit if you have sound reservations.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
