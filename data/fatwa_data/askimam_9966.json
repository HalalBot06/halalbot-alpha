  "question": "Why are there so many forbidden times of Salat? What happens if we happen to read salat in these times? Does it get accepted?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe forbidden times of Salaat are stipulated by Rasulullah (Sallallaahu\nAlayhi Wasallam) himself. According to the Hanafi Madhab, if any present\nFardh Salaat is performed during the forbidden times, it will be discharged\nbut Makrooh.\n\nIf a person performs Qadhaa Salaat during Makrooh times, it will not be\ndischarged.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
