  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know looks or thinks about a women and as a result a substance is released from his privart part is this substance regatrded in the shaiat as mazi or mani and does the person have to take a bath after this\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe liquid emission is mazi. It is impure. The private part and the area soiled with mazi will have to be washed. The soiled portion of the undergarment will have to be washed. Mazi invalidates wudhu and not the ghusal.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
