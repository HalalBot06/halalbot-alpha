  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-u-alaikum Mufti Sahib Thank you for your last answer about praying behind someone already praying. The answer was actually was not complete because I asked that if we are allowed to pray behind someone praying nawafil or vice versa. Please clarify that and also another question is about sadaqa. If we don't give some sadaqa from our pay, what is the punishment? Do we lose barakat in our money?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi school of thought, it is incorrect for a person\nperforming Fardh salaah to follow a person performing Nafl salaah. That is\nhowever permissible according to the majority schools of thought.\nIf Zakaat is compulsory upon a person, that has to be discharged. IF it is\nnot discharged, the wealth is not in the protection of Allah. If the Zakaat\nis not compulsory, then it is advisable to give charity according to ones\nfinancial situation. That increases the barakah in ones health and life.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
