  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like to find out if you have washing on the line (clothes, blankets, etc) and you don't bring it inside before maghrib do you have to wash the cloths again.\n\nMy mother used to say that washing mustn't be on the line maghrib time.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nIt is not necessary to bring the clothing hanging on the line inside the house before Maghrib. If the clothing are left on the light overnight, they don’t have to be rewashed.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\n \n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
