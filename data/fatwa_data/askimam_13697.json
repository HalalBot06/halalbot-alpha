  "question": "whether it is permitted to donate whole or a part of a persons Zakaath to a fund solely engaged in Tsunami reconstruction activities of Muslims",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. Pls let me know whether it is permitted to donate whole or a part of a persons Zakaath to a fund solely engaged in Tsunami reconstruction activities of Muslims. This question is asked due to numerous Islamic organizations requesting for contribution of Zakaath towards Tsunami reconstruction of Muslims.\n\n2. I am a follower of Shafee madhab. In a recent Jummua bayaan it was stated that followers of Shafee madhab should disregard the monetary liabilities in computing Zakaat and pay zakaat for total value of assets. I have always being computing based on Net Worth (adding the recivables and deducting my liabilities). Is the position of disregarding liabilities correct ? Is there a difference between the Madhabs on the basis of computing Zakaat.\n\n3 Could you please enlight me on the Fidiya on missed Salaat of a deceased person (a person who has been performing his salaat until he became gravely ill / unconscious prior to his death). What is the Fidiya per salaat? (what to give, how much to give, to whom to give).\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The fundamental requirement for the fulfillment of Zakaat is Tamleek. That is to give the Zakaat in the possession and ownership of a recipient of Zakaat being a poor and needy Muslim. Zakaat will not be discharged if Tamleek does not take place. If Zakaat monies is used for reconstruction of Tsunami activities without Tamleek to the poor and needy Muslims, then the Zakaat will not be discharged. It is our advise that individuals should be very careful who they appoint to discharge their Zakaat. We recommend appointing such an organization who has Ulama to discharge Zakaat. There is a fear that an organization without Ulama may not discharge the Zakaat according to the Shari’ah.\n\n2. You may refer your query to Moulana Shaykh Taha Karaan of Cape Town. He is a reliable Aalim of the Shaafi’ee Madhab.\n\n3. If a person was unconscious for more than 5 Salaats, he does not have to make Qadhaa for the missed Salaats. If he was ill or unconscious for 5 and less Salaats, he will have to make Qadhaa for those Salaats. If he passed away, then the Fidya for each Salaat should be given which is the equivalent of the Sadaqatul Fitr amount for each missed Salaats.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
