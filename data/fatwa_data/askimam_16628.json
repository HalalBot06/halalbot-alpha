  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am living in Italy and my wife and one daughter is also with me.\nI want to ask about the HAQOOQs of parents and wife. I am earning enough to full fill all rights of wife e,g Shelter , Food and cloths.\nAbove this my behavior is very good my wife. I helped her in all aspects e,g House cleaning , cooking, taking care of baby.\nI got married when I was not doing job. All marriage expenditures were bearded by my parents.\nMy parents were not financially good about 10 years back. But inspite of this they taught me in good schools , universities.\nBut now my parents are financially ok. And I am not giving any thing (money) to my parents. Now after this bachground my qustion is that :\n1- What are the rights of wife and Parents?\n2- As I am living abroad so when I am going to Pakistan Can i purchase gifts for my parents , brothers even if my wife is against this thing?\n3- If I want to give some money to my parents but wife is not happy for this , what I have to do? I mean I should not give money to parents or I can give them?\n\nI am very confused and mentally disturbed with this situation. Kindly guide me with Quran and Hadith.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAccording to Shariah, you are at liberty to spend your surplus money as you wish within the confines of Shariah. Your wife cannot stop you from that. You are duty bound to make ihsaan to your parents as they made ihsaan on you when you were small. Allah says, “And make ihsaan on parents”. It is incorrect of you wife to stop you from fulfilling this Shari obligation. You are also duty bound to maintain family ties with other family members, for example your brothers etc. Exchanging gifts is one way of maintaining a healthy family relationship.\n\nYou should discuss this issue with your wife and enquire from her what is really bothering her. Try to understand her and address her concerns. Perhaps you are overlooking something that is of concern to her. It is best that both of you come to some common ground and understand each other.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
