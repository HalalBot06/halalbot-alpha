  "question": "Berelvis response to 10756...Rasoolullah’s knowledge is nothing compared to Allah because Allah’s knowledge in unlimited whereas the former’s is only till Qiyamah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nBerelvis response to 10756:Bukhari it?s mentioned that once a Munafiq accused Rasoolullah of being ignorant. He confronted the congregation and said ?Ask of me? Munafiq asked ?Will I be in hell or heaven?? He said ?hell? Another man asked ?Who is my father? He responded correctly. This means that he must have knowledge of the unseen as Allah had taught him this knowledge. In hadith he mentioned where people would die in Badr-he knew where people would die and when. This goes against the concept that nobody has knowledge of the five except Allah. It?s true that the knowledge is only with Allah but it is also possible that he can teach such knowledge to those he wills. Those who claim to have the knowledge without Allah?s aid this is wrong. Ibn Jarir explained that the verse ?And taught you what you knew not? as ?What is before and after?. You gave a particular commentary on this verse?where did you get it from? The verses implying only Allah has the knowledge?this is correct; but Allah can teach that knowledge which is only with him. IbnAbbas said Khidr ?kana rajulan ya?lamu ilmal ghaib? which shows the term ?Ilmul Ghaib? can be applied. Rasoolullah?s knowledge is nothing compared to Allah because Allah?s knowledge in unlimited whereas the former?s is only till Qiyamah. Those incidents where Rasoolullah seemed he didn?t know ? he remained silent either for justice or for fear of people making him like they did Isa (AS) (+I didn?t receive the ?revised attachment? from Q. 11261)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe also believe that Allah informed Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] about the future.\n\nRasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] did not have independent knowledge of the future. That is also the case with Khidhr [Alayhis salaam]. Ilmul ghayb refers to the independent knowledge of the future. That is the sole quality of Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
