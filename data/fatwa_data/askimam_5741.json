  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaum O Alaikum brother Mufti, Some of my husbands muslim friends drink alcohol.When they talk they try to say its ok, that they only drink a little. They ask him to back what he says up with true examples and hadiths. could you please give me strong things for him to tell them about why it is haram. Thank you so much. Assalaum O Alaikum\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nO ye who believe! Strong drinks and games of chance and idols and divining%0D%0Aof arrows are only an infamy of Satan's handiwork. Leave it aside in order%0D%0Athat ye may succeed. Satan seeketh only to cast among you enmity and hatred%0D%0Aby means of strong drink and games of chance, and turn you from rememberance%0D%0Aof Allah and from (His) worship. So will ye not then abstain. (Qur'aan%0D%0A5:90-91)%0D%0A%0D%0AIbn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reported the Messenger of Allah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) as saying, 'Every intoxicant is Khamr and every intoxicant%0D%0Ais Haraam (forbidden)' (Bukhari and Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0AAaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha) said that when Allah's messenger was asked about%0D%0Abit which is the nabidh (drink made from dates, raisins, honey), from honey,%0D%0Ahe replied, 'Every liquor which intoxicates is forbidden.' (Bukhari and%0D%0AMuslim)%0D%0A%0D%0AJaabir (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reported the messenger of Allah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) as saying, 'If a large amount of anything causes%0D%0Aintoxication, a small amount of it is prohibited.' (Abu Dawud)%0D%0A%0D%0AAaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha) reported Allah's messenger as saying, 'If a faraq%0D%0A(faraq is about eight kilograms) of anything causes intoxication, a handful%0D%0Aof it is forbidden.' (Abu Dawud)%0D%0A%0D%0AUmar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates, 'I heard from the Prophet (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam), 'He who believes in Allah and the last day should not sit%0D%0Aat a table at which people drink.' (ibn Maajah)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
