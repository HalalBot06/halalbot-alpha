  "question": "If someone has an oppertunity to live in the so called Islamic country....where should he decide to live?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf someone has an oppertunity to live in  the so called Islamic country(as there is no true islamic state) but  he lives in a so called secular state(just for worldly benefits and advatages) which is not really a secular state ,where he has a lot of problems like performing his salat in time with jamat or having masajds most of the places , where should he decide to live?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAbu Saeed Khudri (Radiallahu Anhu) relates that Nabi (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) is reported to have said; “Verily the encounters of migration are severe”.\n\n(Bukhari, Vol.1. Pg.195. Rashidiya)\n\nMigrating from one country to another country is a very big step in a person’s life.  Therefore it is important to consider the following;\n\n1)  Leaving a place he is already accustomed to.\n\n2)  Change of environment for him and his family.  Which may be difficult to cope with.\n\n3)  New living styles will have to be adopted.\n\n4)  No guarantee of proper housing, schooling, and occupation etc.\n\nTherefore if there is freedom of religion in ones country of residence and there is no problem from the side of the government on religious matters, then it is not necessary to migrate from there. Especially if one has a descent job and is earning a moderate amount to see to the needs of his family.\n\nIf a masjid is close to ones home / job then all out efforts should be made to perform salat with jamat.  However, in a case where ones home / job is a distance from the masjid then an effort should be made to perform salat with jamat.  However if this is not possible, one will be excused from salatul jama’at. If a person is lazy in performing salat that same habit will remain even after migrating.  Therefore migrating will not solve the problem. Mugahadah of the nafs is necessary. Ta’ala says;\n\n“As for those who strive hard in Our paths, We will certainly guide them unto Our paths, And indeed Allah Ta’ala is with the good doers”.
