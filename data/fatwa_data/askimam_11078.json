  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy son is 26yr old he is disobident and disrespectful so can i kick him out of the house?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for your mail to the institute.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt will be appreciated if you could forward more details about his behaviour. However, it has to be remembered that when adult offspring live with their parents, they are expected to follow the rules of the house and to accord their parents full respect, kindness, love and support in every way possible. At no stage of their lives are offspring expected to be hurtful or disrespectful to their parents. Kindness and care for parents is closest to love for Allah Ta'ala. In fact the love and care for parents is mentioned many times in the Quran.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou should make it quite clear to your son that as long as he is prepared to live under your roof, he has to abide by your rules and respect the sanctity of your household. I await more information on the matter. May Allah Ta'ala make your children the coolness of your eyes and may He grant them the tawfeeq to earn His pleasure by being obedient and kind to their parents. Ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best.%0D%0A%0D%0AWassalaam.%0D%0A%0D%0A1Social department%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
