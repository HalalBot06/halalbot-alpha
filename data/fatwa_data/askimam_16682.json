  "question": "Imitating the Non Muslims",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf a person carries out the fundaentals of islam, lives his life according to the shariah and practices the sunans of the prophet s.a.w.,however his dressing is like the non muslims i.e.top and trousers then would he stil be raised amongst those people whom he imitated,meaing the jews and the christians because of his clothing?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAllah Ta'ala states:\n\n لَقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِي رَسُولِ اللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ لِمَنْ كَانَ يَرْجُو اللَّهَ وَالْيَوْمَ الْآَخِرَ وَذَكَرَ اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا\n\n\"Verily, in the Messenger of Allah is the most beautiful example to follow for those of you who desire Allah and the Last Day and remember Allah excessively.\"\n\nThe Prophet also advised and ordered the Muslims to differ from the disbelievers in their habits and manners. He himself used to be very particular and precautious in following their ways. In one Hadith narrated in Abu Dawud Sharīf, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaiyhi Wasallam) stated, \"Whoever imitates a nation is considered amongst them.\"\n\nمن تشبه بقوم فهو منهم\n\nIt is a known fact that imitating a person creates a link of affinity and admiration for that person. In the beginning, the imitation is merely external whereby a person will imitate another person's dress and mannerisms. However, over a period of time the eternal imitation transforms into internal imitation whereby a person adopts his ethos and philosophy. If a person develops a great affinity and attachment to the ways and tenets of the non-Muslims, he will eventually drift away from the dogma and doctrine of Islam (may Allah protect us from that) which is the greatest loss.\n\nIn reference to your question, if a person is carrying out all of the religious obligations upon him and following the Sunan to the best of his ability, he should be encouraged to follow the Sunnah manner of dress as well. However, if a person, due to his own weakness and inability to adopt the Sunnah garb wears the western shirts and trousers, it will not necessarily mean that he has reneged from the fold of Islam. Unfortunately, so many Muslims have adopted this style of dress that it no longer remains a salient symbol or feature of the non-Muslims. Therefore, merely adopting such attire, despite it being disliked, will not cause a person to be raised up as a jew or christian.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
