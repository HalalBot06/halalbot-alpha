JazakAllah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) In order for us to advise, kindly inform on the following: a) Is the%0D%0AImaam an Aalim, b) Are you an Aalim. We also wish to advise that if a person%0D%0Ahas prejudice, it may not be useful to talk to him. Only sincere seekers of%0D%0Athe truth are guided.%0D%0A%0D%0A2) Kindly refer attached - Taqleed%0D%0A%0D%0A6) Refer below - Taweez%0D%0A%0D%0A7) It is possible that a person has a formula to enhance love between the%0D%0Ahusband and wife. However, the effect in the formula is only by the order of%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala. One must also be very careful of the person who makes such a%0D%0Aclaim as many such people have ulterior motives and devious motives in such%0D%0Apractices.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ATAWEEZ%0D%0AAllah Ta%E3la says in the Noble Qur%E3n, 'In the Qur%E3n is (spiritual, physical)%0D%0Acure for people.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThe opening chapter of the Noble Qur%E3n, Surah Faatiha is also called the%0D%0Achapter of Shifaa. It is recorded in the Bukhari Shareef vol. 1 p. , 'A%0D%0Aruler of a certain clan was stung by a creature, the people of the area%0D%0Arequested the Sahaaba to cure him, one Sahaabi read Surah Faatiha and blew%0D%0Aon the affected area and cured the ruler. The Prophet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam) even praised the Sahaabi for doing so.%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the above quotations, it is clear that the verses of the Noble Qur%E3n is%0D%0Aa means of cure. Treating oneself with Taweez containing verses of the Qur%E3n%0D%0Ais similar to treating oneself with medication. By using medication, one%0D%0Amerely places his trust in Allah Ta%E3la and use the medication as a means of%0D%0Acure. The effect in the means is with the Will of Allah Ta%E3la so, too is the%0D%0Ausage of the Taweez.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe art of making Taweez is a science independent to other known sciences.%0D%0APeople who have studied this science are most knowledgeable to explain its%0D%0Avast understanding. One thing must be outlined at the outset is that anyone%0D%0Apractising the making of Taweez cannot ascribe (in his method and%0D%0Aapplication) partners with Allah Ta%E3la. Any act of Kufr is unacceptable in%0D%0AIslam.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe people during the time of Jaahiliyya had an incorrect belief that the%0D%0Astars and planets cause rainfall, but the Prophet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam) dismissed that. The drawings and illustrations used in Taweez are%0D%0Alike the concepts used in geometry, etc. to arrive at a solution.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn conclusion, consider the following Hadith: Abu Khuzaymah (Radhiallaahu%0D%0A%C1nhu) narrates from his father that he asked Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam), 'Inform me about Rukan (blowing in water and Taweez), medication,%0D%0Aand means of security, does it change Taqdeer (predestination)? He replied,%0D%0A'They (all the above) are within Taqdeer. (Mishk%E3t pg. 22)%0D%0A%0D%0ATAQLEED%0D%0AThe concept of Taqlid simplified%0D%0A%0D%0ATaqlid refers to the practice of an unqualified, lay person (in a specific field of specialization) submitting to and accepting the authority of an expert in that field, without demanding proof and justification for every view, opinion or verdict expressed by such an expert authority.%0D%0A%0D%0AImitation is a natural tendency of human existence, practiced by millions of people worldwide in every facet of life. The simplest and most tangible example of Taqlid is that of a child learning his basic alphabets at school. Every child learning his alphabets is unconsciously practicing Taqlid. A learner driver taking instructions from a driving instructor is practicing Taqlid. People going to a specialist doctor for medical treatment and following his instructions is another example of Taqlid. A lay person soliciting a legal opinion from an advocate or following the advice of a tax consultant is another common case of Taqlid. A client at an engineering firm, asking for the engineer's advice on complex engineering calculations is yet another instance of Taqlid in action. The millions of 'facts' in the myriad of sciences such as astronomy, archaeology, etc. are all distinct examples of Taqlid. Who ever questions the 'fact' that the sun is really 93 million miles away from the earth! It is taken for granted that this is the findings of the 'experts' in these fields and everyone simply accepts it as such. School teachers teach these to their pupils as 'gospel truth' and children learn and memorize these 'facts' with the hope of succeeding in their exams. There are countless such examples of Taqlid in everyday existence.%0D%0A%0D%0ABy way of extension, Taqlid is the easy option for ordinary people In the context of Islamic Fiqh or Law too. Taqlid in Islam simply refers to accepting and following the verdicts of expert scholars of Islamic Fiqh in their exposition and interpretation of Islamic Law, without demanding from them an in-depth explanation of the intricate processes (Ijtihad) required in arriving at such a verdict. It simply means that ordinary folk do not have to do Ijtihad. The duty of ordinary people is to trustingly accept the authority of the learned scholars in this matter and act upon their verdicts.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn this sense, Taqlid is a great blessing for common people, for it is beyond the capacity of everyone to understand the extremely complex and complicated mechanics of Ijtihad. The ability to do Ijtihad requires many long years of study and erudition and a great deal of exertion in acquiring a mastery of various Islamic sciences.%0D%0A%0D%0AKhalid Dhorat (Mawlana)"
