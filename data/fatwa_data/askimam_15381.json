  "question": "Why has part twelve been expunged from Behisti Zehwar?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThe wahabis allege that an essay by Imdadullah Muhajir Makki has been compiled in the English translation of ‘Bahishti Zewar by the name, ‘Unity in Islam’ and its subject is the Deobandi-Barelawi Dispute. In this essay, Imdadullah Muhajir Makki comments upon the Milaad gatherings, which are held to commemorate the birth of Allah’s Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam). In these gatherings, poetry in praise of Allah’s Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) is read and when the crowd is signaled, everybody stands (to greet the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam). Imdadullah Muhajir Makki, the esteemed Shaikh of the Deobandi scholars, says about the Milaad gatherings... “…you should not hate someone who does not perform ‘Qiyaam’ (standing) in Milaad because this is not Wajib (desirable) or Fardh (obligatory)… If you know someone, who considers the Qiyaam as Wajib (obligatory), then Qiyaam will be an innovation for him alone. However, to call all those who perform Qiyaam in Milaad, as innovators, is exceeding the limit. It is quiet possible that the holy Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) stays in his abode in Paradiseand our activities are shown to him as on T.V. or somehow through other means; through Angels or without them…” He further adds, “Consider these differences as trivial (unimportant), like the differences between Imam Abu Haneefah and Imam ash-Shafi’ee”. He says: “Do not oppose these ceremonies, where they are customary… If those who oppose Qiyaam are also invited in a general meeting, then it is better to drop the Qiyaam. However, if it is not possible to do so, then if they (those opposed to Qiyaam) wish to continue then they should also join the rest in Qiyaam and Salaam.”\n\n1.Is this true?\n2.Why has part twelve been expunged from Behisti Zehwar? \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nBehishti Zewar is compiled by Hazrath Moulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi (RA) and not . Hajee Imdaadullah Muhajir Makki (RA). We are not aware of such an essay in Behishti Zewar. If you have seen such an essay, kindly forward that to us.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
