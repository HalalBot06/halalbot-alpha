  "question": "What is the criteria for halal/haram food in Canada? Is there a Mufti here?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam I live in Canada and am having trouble eating halal. There are strict opinions (eg: for cheese, it is haram if the bacteria used were cloned/synthesized from bacteria obtained from pork) or very lenient (eg: unless it explicitly says pork, alcohol, etc., everything is halal). I have also heard of something called principle of transformation which makes certain chemicals obtained from pork halal. Please help me, I'm a very confused Hanafi. Wassalam, Omar\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe advise you contact Mufti Aslam in Toronto. He is a teacher in Hadith at\nAjax Darul Uloom.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
