  "question": "Im feeling guilty i touched her while helping her",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nRecently I was faced with a difficult situation. I was walking down the road and from the opposite side, a yound girl came on a scooter, skidded and fell on the road. She was flat on the road and in pain. I helped her to a sitting position and after 30 minutes, she was able to somehow move on. While helping her, I had to hold her arm and to lift her, I had to put my arm around her. Now I am feeling very guilty that I have done a big sin. But what else could I have done. There was no other person around and I could not leave a person in pain. Please advise. \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIn principle, it is strictly forbidden for a male to touch any non-mehram (with whom marriage is allowed) female. However, in certain cases, such as the case of a Muslim doctor who has to treat a female patient, Shari'ah has granted permissibility for the doctor to treat the effected area due to necessity. Similarly, in this particular case you mention that no other person was around to help the young girl and she was lying flat in pain. In both of these cases, the following Fiqhi Principle would come into effect:\n\nالضرورات تبيح المحظورات\n\n\"Cases of need are restricted to the actual need\"\n\nThis means that only whatever is necessary to be done to help her should be done and if there is an absolute necessity for any contact to be made, it should be kept at a minimum. Similarly, any speaking should also be kept to a minimum and the gaze should be kept lowered. One should always have taqwa (fear of Allah Ta'ala) in his heart.\n\nIt was commendable for you to help this person who was in urgent need, especially since no other person was around. However, if you feel as though you had wrong intentions when helping her, or more contact than necessary was made, or if you felt any desires or lust while helping her, then sincere repentance must be made to Allah Ta'ala. Even if you do feel as though your intention was proper, it will still be rewarding for you to do istighfaar in case of any wrongdoing. Allah Ta'ala is the Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.\n\n(Al-Ashbah wa-Nazaair, P. 87, Qadimi Kutub Khana)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
