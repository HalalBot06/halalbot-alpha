To follow the fashion of another culture like the west goes against the Shariah as the Prophet ((Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)) said \"Whosoever imitates a nation is of them.\" If your fashion is according to the Shariah and you are not imitating another nation or culture then only it will be permissible..%0D%0A%0D%0A2. According to the Shariah your action will be based according to your intention. Nabi (saw) said \"Verily your deeds are judged by your intention....\" So if you steal you may be punished by the law of the country but according to the shariah you would be judged by the intention.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. To answer this question I refer you to the above mentioned Hadith that your deed is judged by your intention and being a pillar of Islam you have no excuse to leave your Salaah and your father is fulfilling his part of the Shariah which is \"Order your children at the age of 7 and beat them at the age of ten.\" Again you would be rewarded by your intention.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. All praise be to Allah that you have put Allah before your friend and this the requirement of the Shariah that you put Allah and his Rasool (saw) before everything else. You need not keep your friend away from your home you may show him the correct path and invite him to the correct Deen. But be very careful there are differences between the Shia And the Ahl-Sunnah Refer to our reponces to the Shia.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Refer 1 above.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. The size of your hair is not a condition for the acceptance of the Salaah but if you are unable to put on a hat for Salaah then the Hair style is not permissible or if you are following a fashion of another culture or nation.%0D%0A%0D%0A7. You need to visit a doctor to find out what could be the cause like to rule out infections or even anxiety makes one visit the bathroom frequently once this is established there duas that one can Read For now you can make the Dua O Allah there is no ease except in that which you have made easy, and You make the difficulty,if You wish it easy .%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AShaykh Irshaad Amod%0D%0AAL-FALAAH COLLEGE%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
