  "question": "Can the witnesses of Nikah be Christian, especially if you are marrying a Christian girl and what if you are at place where there are no Muslims around.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n2. How many times did Hadrat Hasan married (please do answer this question because i have asked so many Alims this question and no body want to answer it) 3. Do you agree with following and why: (I talked to 2 Aalims regarging Hadrat Hasan, they did't answer me at all.(b/c big Ulamas does't discuss such matters with non-Aalims; they said,\"ask us your problem, we'll answer u but dont ask us DALIL because u r not Aalim).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nUnanswered1. If a Muslim male marries a Christian girl in the presence of 2 non-Muslim\nwitnesses, the Nikah will be correct. (Shaami vol.3 pg.23; HM Sa'eed).\nHowever, due to possible problems in the future, both, Nikah to a Christian\nfemale as well as witness of non-Muslims should be avoided.\n2. According to historical narration, Hadhrat Hasan (Radhiallaahu Anhu)\nmarried 90 women. (Taarikhul Khulafaa). If that is correct, then obviously\nHadhrat Hasan (Radhiallaahu Anhu) must have had a maximum of 4 wives at\nonce.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
