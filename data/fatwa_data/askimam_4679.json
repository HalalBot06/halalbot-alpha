  "question": "I need to know if my marriage is valid. Q1: My husband and I have been under the effect of sihr (magic) done by his ex-wife, we have proof, she also admitted it.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nW. Once in her house(to visit his children)we had a huge fight and he gave me talak upon my repetitive requestse care for each other so much and need each other's support in tabligh work. We reconciled but everytime we have a big fight even for no valid reason,I end up asking for talak,when I calm down I can't believe my crazy request. A few months later I went hysterical asking him for talak to the point of hurting myself physically;as he couldn't calm me down he prononced talak against his will again just to calm me. We reconciled again alhamdulillah. I never intended to get divorced from my him neither did he,it was the sihr affecting us so much. Are these two talaks valid? We are so afraid of loosing each other. Q2: I was married before at a young age.I got a divorce by him saying talak after a few months. He tried to make up with me after; we got intimate,but I realized I was making a mistake and cut ties with him. Being so ignorant about islam, we both didn't know about Iddat period and don't remember if the intercourse happened during iddat or after. I then filed for a legal divorce which he agreed to sign. Is it valid?Jazakallahkhair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\na) We regret to inform you that the two Talaaqs issued by your husband are\nvalid. We advise in future you exercise restraint and avoid asking divorce.\nIf your husband issues you one more divorce, your Nikah will be permanently\nsevered.\nb) Your question is not clear. You stated you were married before and got\ndivorced by him. Who is 'him', your ex-husband or present husband? In\nprinciple, if a husband files for a legal divorce or agrees to sign a legal\ndivorce, it will constitute a Shar'ee Talaaq.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
