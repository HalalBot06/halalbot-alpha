  "question": "Is it permissible to start the Naamaz with Allah-u-Kareem instead of the takbir Allah-u-Akbar?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo recite the Takbeer-e-Tahrima with Allaahu Akbar was the sunnah of our\nbeloved Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Therefore, to commence Salaat\nwith Allaahu Kareem will be contrary to the Sunnah. However, the Salaat\ncommenced with Allaahu Kareem will be valid.\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
