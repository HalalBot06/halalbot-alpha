  "question": "(1) Can the Holy Quran be given to the kuffar?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n(1) Can the Holy Quran be given to the kuffar?\n\nIf yes then: Can only the translation of the Quran be given to them (not the original Arabic one), or; Can the original Arabic Quran be given to them also?\n\nIf your answer is that only translation of Quran can be given to the kuffar and not the original Arabic one, then what about the Arab Christians – what do we give them?\n\nIf your answer is that we can give the kuffar the Quran whether translation or the original Arabic, then what does this verse mean:” None shall touch it save the purified ones.” (56:79), and the verse that says that the mushrikeen are impure (9:28).\n\n Isn’t it based on the former verse that our scholars say that Quran can’t be touched without wudhu or ghusl?\n\nIf your answer is that the kuffar can’t be given the Quran at all, then why has Allah directly addressed mankind (O ye people, O mankind) in nearly 20 verses. Aren’t the kuffar amongst mankind?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe Qur’aan (together with its Arabic text) can be given to non-Muslims if one is hopeful that by reading it, they will be guided to Islam. However, a prerequisite is that they are clean before touching it. If one is certain or has reason to believe that he/she will show disprespect to the Qur’aan, it is not permissible to give them the Qur’aan.\n\nNon-Muslims are not under obligation to accept the subsidiary commandments and therefore, the verse of the Qur’aan that you have quoted (56:79) refers only to believers. Also, the verse referring to the impurity of the disbelievers refer to the impurity of their hearts because of their disbelief.
