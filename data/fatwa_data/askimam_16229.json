  "question": "According to our Aqeedah, only person Masoom (sinless) are only the Imbhiyah (Prophets)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAccording to our Aqeedah, only person Masoom (sinless) are only the Imbhiyah (Prophets). The reference is also present on this site.\n\nReference: http://www.alinaam.org.za/library/aqeedah/aqaaid204.htm\n\nHowever, some one brought to my attention 4:59, and similar verses from the same chapter, claim that the Massomiyat also extends to \"the people who have authority\" (as reference in verse 4:59, and through out the chapter).\n\nKindly, if possible, can you please explain the verse? I would be very obliged.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThe verse in question,\n\nيَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آَمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ وَأُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْكُمْ فَإِنْ تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآَخِرِ ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلًا\n\n“O you who believe, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. Then, if you quarrel about something, revert it back to Allah and the Messenger, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is good, and the best at the end.”\n\nThe above verse does not even remotely suggest that the people in authority are sinless. The commentators of the Holy Quran mention that this verse refers to obedience to the Muslim rulers in general or specifically to Muslim commanders during military expeditions. They do not mention anything in regards to such leaders being sinless. (Ruh al-Ma’ani, vol. 3 pgs.64-65)\n\nFurthermore, it is the belief of the Ahlus Sunnah wa al-Jama’ah that the Ambiya are sinless as opposed to the Auliya and other general believers. Allamah Taftazani رحمه الله mentions that a Wali (saint) can never reach the status of a Nabi and among one of the stated reasons for this is the fact that Ambiya are Masoom (sinless) as opposed to the Auliya. (Sharh al-Aqa’id, pg. 164, Imdadiya)\n\n(ولا يبلغ الولي درجة الأنبياء) لأن الأنبياء معصومون مأمونون عن خوف الخاتمة (شرح العقائد)\n\nThe claim that the people of authority are sinless extending from the purport of the above-mentioned verse is easily repelled by the fact that Abu Bakr رضى الله عنه was appointed as the first Khalifa of the Muslim Ummah by consensus of all the Sahaba رضى الله عنهم despite the fact that he was not Masoom. (Sharh al-Aqa’id, pg. 156, Imdadiya)\n\nIn conclusion, Mufti Mahmood Hasan Gangohi رحمه الله , the grand Mufti of Dar al-Uloom Deoband, states that being sinless applies to three, namely, Prophets, Angels, and small children. (Fatawa Mahmoodiya, vol. 1 pg. 411-412, Jamia Farooqiya)\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Yusuf bin Yaqub,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
