  "question": "Is it right if I got a little bit upset that My older brother got a new baby",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy older brother got a new baby, that?s fine and Alhamdulillah but the reason why I?m upset is 1) I live in another country and I didn?t even know about my sister in law?s pregnancy and I knew only when I phoned and got surprised (3 days after the birth of the baby) 2) My older brother was finding it difficult to satisfy the needs of his 4 four children and I asked my self why adding another one? Was I right to be upset? I know that ??.When Allah Ta√£la intends creating a child, nothing can stop him? but it was for me like he?s making life difficult for himself\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou know that every child that comes in this world is with the order of Allah. It is, therefore, incorrect for you to feel upset. Probably, your brother knows how you feel and had reservations in informing you about their new born.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
