  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n        I got married a year ago and, i would like to know if there is any different dua or niyaat to be read or intended during the ghusul after have intercourse with wife. Also, i would like to know if the ghusul procedure is same as we do in the normal days..Kindly guide me. Because my wife said there is niyaat for ladies to be read during ghusul after intercourse. waiting for your reply......\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nGhusl after intercourse is wajib. The procedure for every wajib ghusl is the same. There is no specific dua or intention for this ghusl.\n\n \n\nProcedure For Performing GHUSL\n\n1. Wash both hands including the wrists.\n2. Wash the private parts. The hands and private parts should be washed even if one is not in the state of JANAABAT or NAJAASAT.\n3. If there is NAJAASAT elsewhere on the body, it should now be washed off.\n4. Perform Wudhu. If one is making Ghusl on a stool or platform where water will rapidly flow away, then perform the complete Wudhu. If there is a fear of the feet being dipped in waste water during the Ghusl then postpone the washing of the feet to the end of the Ghusl. Ensure that the mouth and nostrils are thoroughly rinsed THRICE.\n5. After performing Wudhu pour water over the head thrice.\n6. Thereafter pour water thrice over the right shoulder and thrice over the left shoulder.\n7. Then pour water over the entire body and rub.\n8. If the hair of the head is not plaited, it is compulsory to wet all the hair upto the very base.\n\nIf a single hair is left DRY, Ghusl will NOT be VALID.\nIf the hair of a woman are plaited, she is excused from loosening her plaited hair but it is COMPULSORY for her to wet the base of each and every hair, If she fails to do so then the Ghusl will NOT be VALID.\nAs for men who grow long hair and plait them, they are NOT EXCUSED from leaving their hair DRY.\nIf a woman experiences difficulty or is unable to wet the very bottom of her plaited hair, then it is necessary for her to unplait her hair and wash her entire hair.\n\n9. It is MUSTAHAB (preferable) to clean the body by rubbing it.\nAll parts of the body should be rubbed with the hands to ensure that water has reached all parts of the body and no portion is left dry.\n10. Rings, earrings, etc. should be removed to ensure that no portion covered by them is left dry. Ensure that the navel and ears are all wet. If they are not wet Ghusl will be incomplete.\n11. On completion one should confine oneself to a clean place. If, while performing Wudhu the feet had been washed, it is not necessary to wash them again. Dry the body with a clean towel and dress as hastily as possible.\n12. If after Ghusl one recalls that a certain portion of the body is left dry.\nIt is not necessary to repeat the Ghusl. Merely wash the dry portion.\nIt is not sufficient to pass a wet hand over the dry place. If one has forgotten to rinse the mouth or the nostrils, these too must be rinsed when recalled after Ghusl has been performed.\n\n \n\n(Extracted from Talimul Haq, Part 4)\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl.
