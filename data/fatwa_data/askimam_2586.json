  "question": "Is the Valima (Walima, Reception) which is given after Nikah, haram if the husband does not have intercourse with his wife after marriage.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWALIMA%0D%0A%0D%0AThe religion of Islam accommodates and facilitates the nature of man to%0D%0Aexpress his happiness during happy achievements and developments. A person%0D%0Awho intends to marry endeavours to choose a compatible partner for life. A%0D%0Apartner who will be like the heart of the body sharing every happy and glad%0D%0Aoccasion with him. In fact the wife's attitude towards her husband, her%0D%0Aservices and-her level of sincerity will actually determine his happiness or%0D%0Amisery. Therefore the choice of a partner in reality is his choice of%0D%0Ahappiness and misery. After much efforts in searching he chooses his partner%0D%0Aand proposes. The suspense of a positive or negative answer is in itself a%0D%0Apainful situation. After undergoing this painful situation, he at last gets%0D%0Aa favourable reply. What a happy achievement!%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever his anticipation continues since the day of the Nikah is still far%0D%0Aaway and anything can happen. Finally after the long and arduous process the%0D%0Aday of the Nikah has arrived and he takes a major step towards determining%0D%0Ahis future happiness or sadness. He has taken on a partner for life. The%0D%0Asame applies to his wife also who is also making a major commitment. The%0D%0AShariat has created a mode of expressing and celebrating this great%0D%0Aachievement and this is the Waleema.%0D%0A1. Waleema is to express ones happiness for the happy and important%0D%0Adevelopment of Nikah in ones life. Since Walima in essence is an expression%0D%0Aof happiness at being married therefore it may take place before or after%0D%0Aconsummation.%0D%0A2. Walima is a sunnat of Rasulullah and accepting a walima invitation is%0D%0Aalso a sunnat.%0D%0A%0D%0AConditions for acceptance of a Walima invitation%0D%0A* The invited person must not fear any harm or disgrace in religious matters.%0D%0A* There is nothing unIslamic in the invitation.%0D%0A* There are no photographers or cameras at the gathering.%0D%0A* There is no mixed gathering between males and females.%0D%0A%0D%0ASome other pertinent Masaail regarding to Walima%0D%0ATo delay and procrastinate the walima is against the sunnat. Rasulullah%0D%0A(SAW) had his Walima even on journey with whoever was present.%0D%0AThe walima should be done according to the financial position of the husband%0D%0Aand extravagance etc. should not be found. It is against the sunnat to take%0D%0Aloans and put oneself into a fancily constraint in order to perform this%0D%0Asunnat. Rasulullah (SAW) mentioned that the worst walima is wherein only the%0D%0Arich are invited and the poor are left out. (Mishkaat)%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah knows best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFatwa Department%0D%0AMadrasah In'aamiyyah, Camperdown%0D%0A"
