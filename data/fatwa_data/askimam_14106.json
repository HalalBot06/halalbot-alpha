  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am the Imam at a Masjid in USA. I would like to know if it is permissible for the Imam to start the Salah few minutes before the stipulated time of the Masjid for some important reason.\n\nThere was a lecture of guest Aalim after Maghrib Salah at our Masjid. He drove for 4 hours to come to our Masjid. There was dinner after his Speech. The arrangements for dinner were made in the Parking Lot of the Masjid. The speech finished at 7:25. The time of Isha starts at 7:28. The time of Jamaat was at 7:45. Since it was very cold that night and people had to eat in the cold, and also because the guest Aalim had to drive back after Isha for 4 hours, and also because most of the regular Musalli of our Masjid were present at the Masjid plus over 150 more Muslims came to listen to the speech, I took Mashwara from the Musalli's whether we should pray Isha Salah right after the Azan. The people said yes. But when I when I was about to start the Salah a person started yelling in the Masjid that we must wait till 7:45.That person also made some derogatory comments for the Imam.\n\nIn the circumstances mentioned above, do I have the right to what I did after taking Mashwara from the Musalli’s.Is yelling allowed in the Masjid? Can a Musalli insult the Imam, like this and later pray behind the Imam?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nShari’ah has stipulated the commencing and ending times for the different Salaats. It did not stipulate a specific time to congregate. Therefore, the time specification for the different Salaats is not an absolute Shar’ee issue. It is also an administrative issue.\n\nThe times for congregation could be adjusted according to circumstances. Since people are sensitive to time, that should also be taken into consideration and adjustment should be made with consultation. In the instance referred by you, you have acted appropriately. You took into consideration the visiting Imaam, the cold weather and the Musallees also approved the adjustment. The person who was yelling and made derogatory remarks has not acted appropriately. He should extend an apology.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
