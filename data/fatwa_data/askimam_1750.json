  "question": "Please explain Al Qadaa wul Qadar in reference to the Hanafi view?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nJazak Allah Khairun!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAl-Qadhaa literally means that which is decreed and Al-Qadr means that which is measured. According to the Shariah it refers to the absolute and perfect knowledge of Allah having knowledge of everything ahead of time. It does not that we as human beings have no choice of performing good deeds and abstaining from wrong and sinful deeds.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E.Desai"
