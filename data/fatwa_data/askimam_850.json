  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe women being talked here was 13 years of age when she was engaged and now she is 18 years old, and instead of marrying the person she was engaged to at an early age, she wants to marry someone else. Is she allowed to break the engagment and marry the man she wants to?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAn engagement is a confirmation to get married. If one (boy or girl) does not want to qualify the engagement by marriage, they reserve the right to\nwithdraw. However, as a female, we advise she consult with her parents in making a decision.\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
