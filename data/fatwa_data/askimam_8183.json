  "question": "Can women use a cream to make her breasts \"normal?\"",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen I was young (from 5th grade to 10th grade) I ran a lot; I was in gym class, track and cross-country. At that young age, I was developing; being so young and at a developing age, I was very shy about talking about the type of sports bra that I needed. I didn't ask my mom for a good bra until the 10th grade. For about 5 years I didn't get a good, supporting bra. As a result, my breasts sagged a lot pre-maturely. Currently, I am 17. I would like to know if I can use a supplement(pills)/cream/surgery(augmentation) to make them look normal again as I am afraid my husband will be disgusted by my breasts. It's a very touchy issue with me and I'm sorry if I disgusted or offended you in talking about them. Jazakallakharum. You are a very good man and I always TRY to follow your answers to questions because you use correct sources and your answers are not corrupt (alhamdullilah). Jazakallakharum again.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible to use medication to normalize your breasts.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
