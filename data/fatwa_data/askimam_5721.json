  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo be a means of one accepting Islam is indeed an act of virtue. However,%0D%0Athat should be without any ulterior motive, for example, marriage.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe have noticed that many people accepted Islam for marriage convenience and%0D%0Areverted to their old religion if the marriage did not work out. If the girl%0D%0Asincerely wishes to accept Islam and marriage is not the reason, then refer%0D%0Abelow on 'How to convert'.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AQ. \"What is the procedure for a Christian to convert to Islam in order to%0D%0Amarry a Sunni Muslim girl?%0D%0A%0D%0AA. It is not correct practice to embrace Islam for the sake of marrying a%0D%0AMuslim girl only. Islam is a composition of certain beliefs and acts. It is%0D%0Aa way of life. It is a matter of faith and conviction. In order to become a%0D%0AMuslim, it is necessary to accept all its basic teachings with one's heart%0D%0Aand soul. If one's real purpose is only to marry a Muslim girl, and he wants%0D%0Ato register himself as a Muslim only because he cannot marry that girl%0D%0Awithout it, while he does not have faith in the basic beliefs of Islam, he%0D%0Acannot be a Muslim in reality.%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore, one should know at the first instance that conversion to Islam is%0D%0Anot meant for marrying Muslim girls. One should, first, study the basic%0D%0AIslamic beliefs and teachings, and if he is convinced that they are worth%0D%0Aaccepting, he should accept Islam for its inherent rightfulness and its%0D%0Aintrinsic merits, and not only because he wants to marry a girl.%0D%0A%0D%0ANow, the basic beliefs one is required to accept while entering into Islam%0D%0Aare the following :%0D%0A%0D%0A(i) God is one. He has neither a partner, nor a son or daughter. He is one%0D%0Ain the true sense of the word which has no room for the concept of Trinity,%0D%0Aor for any other form of camoufaged monotheism or a disguised polytheism.%0D%0A%0D%0A(ii) The Holy Prophet Muhammad ( Sallaho Alaihai Wasallam ) is the last%0D%0AMessenger of Allah after whom no messanger or Prophet of Allah (in any sense%0D%0Aof the word) will come.%0D%0A%0D%0A(iii) The Holy Quran is the last of the divine books revealed on the Holy%0D%0AProphet ( Sallaho Alaihai Wasallam ) and all its contents are true.%0D%0A%0D%0A(iv) The life Hereafter is the eternal life one has to live after his death%0D%0Awhere he will have to face the fate of his good and evil deeds.%0D%0A%0D%0A(v) All the teachings given by the Holy Quran or by the Holy Prophet (%0D%0ASallaho Alaihai Wasallam ) in absolute and unambiguous terms are true and%0D%0Aacceptable.%0D%0A%0D%0AOnce a person accepts all these fundamental beliefs as true, both verbally%0D%0Aand with his heart, he becomes a Muslim.%0D%0A%0D%0AConversion to Islam has no particular procedure, like baptism etc. As soon%0D%0Aas a person accepts the aforementioned bel- iefs with his heart and soul and%0D%0Aprofesses them verbally, he enters the fold of Islam. It is not necessary%0D%0Athat he seeks the mediation of a saint or priest, nor is it a prerequiste to%0D%0Ago to mosque or to an institution for accepting Islam. One can acc- ept%0D%0AIslam on his own. However, it is advisable to go to a learned Muslim who can%0D%0Ainform him about the basic beliefs of Islam and can teach him the concise%0D%0Aand comprehensive words to express his acceptance to those beliefs.%0D%0A%0D%0ANormally following sentences are used for that purpose :%0D%0A%0D%0AAsh-hadu an laa ilaaha illallaahu wa ash-hadu anna muhammadan rasoolullah%0D%0AI bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I bear witness that%0D%0AMuhammad (S.A.W.) is His slave and messenger.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AAamantu billaahi wa malaaikatihi wa kutubihi wa rusulihi wal yawmal aakhir%0D%0Awal qadar khayrihi wa sharrihi minallaahi ta'aala wal ba'ath ba'adal mawt%0D%0A\"I have believed in Allah and His Angels and His Books (as they were%0D%0Aoriginally revealed on His Prophets) and in His messengers and in the Last%0D%0ADay and in the fact that all the good and bad destinies come from Allah and%0D%0Ain being raised alive after death.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AA further requirement for a convert Muslim is to free himself from those%0D%0Abeliefs of his former faith or religion which are not in line with the%0D%0AIslamic beliefs. For example, a Christian must proclaim that he does no more%0D%0Abelieve Jesus Christ as the Son of God or a part of the Godhead. Instead, he%0D%0Aaccepts that he was a revered messenger of Allah, and was no more than a%0D%0Amessenger, having all the human attributes. There is a large number of%0D%0AMuslim institutes in karachi which can help a non-Muslim to do the needful%0D%0Afor accepting Islam. Here are the addresses of some of them :%0D%0A%0D%0AContemporary Fataawa - Mufti Taqi Usmani"
