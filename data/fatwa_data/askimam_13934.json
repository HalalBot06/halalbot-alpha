  "question": "If one utters talaq once will this end the marriage or is it necessary to utter talaq three times?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf one utters talaq once will this end the marriage or is it necessary to utter talaq three times?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf one utters an explicit Talaaq, a ‘Talaaq-e-Raj’ee’ (revocable divorce) takes place. He may take her back during the iddah period. Once the iddah expires without him taking her back, the Nikah has terminated and he may not take her back without a renewal of the Nikah. Therefore, to answer your question, this type of Talaaq does not terminate the Nikah immediately.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
