  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissible to give blood sample for analysis during fasting by a syringe, also there is a test in which a pin is pricked on the finger tip and 1 or 2 drops of blood comes out which is then taken for analysis. please specify are these both blood tests allowed during fasting?  Will it invalidate the rozah ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf a person becomes extremely weak due to the blood test, it will be disliked for him to do so whilst fasting. If he is not weakened by it, there will be no detestability in doing so. In either scenario, the fast will be valid.\n\n(Hashiyah al-Tahtāwi ‘alā al-Marāqil Falāh, pg. 680, Ilmiyyah)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
