  "answer": "QUESTION\ni promised my fiance that i will keep beard after two years of marriage,atleast.then i became active the work of dawah.now i want to keep beard.i told my wish to my wife to be,but she says that i will be breaking my promise.and if i want to keep beard keep it till i am in australia but once i go back to pakistan she wants me to cut the beard.If i dont she says she will cut her hair,which i dont want her to do. tell me what should i do? how can i keep beard in such a situation?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for the question which you have presented to the institute.%0D%0A%0D%0AAt the outset, we must point out that the concept of fianc%E9 and fianc%E9e has no basis in Islam. Every form of pre-marital relationship is strictly prohibited. Furthermore, one should seek a wife who is compatible and pious. A wife who does not respect the Sunnah of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) may well not respect her husband. That will lead to grief and agony for him. It is not up to you to decide what you want.%0D%0A%0D%0AI find it strange that if you are not married yet, why is it that a simple \"non-issue\" about a beard on your face has led to a dispute. A beard is part of a Muslim man's face so I cannot understand how it forms part of a marriage contract. I also do not understand the point of having a beard in Australia and not in Pakistan. I would have thought it would be the other way round due to the present persecution of Muslims in Australia.%0D%0A%0D%0AA Taab?iee, Abdullah Daylami (rahmatullah Alayh) said, \"From the early saintly elders the saying has reached me that the disappearance of Deen from this world commences with the omission of the Sunnah. One by one the Sunnats will be discarded just like the coils of the rope are removed one by one.\" (Daramy).%0D%0A%0D%0AI quote from a little book titled \"The beard....a humorous sketch. * A duel between The Body and Satan.\" The book was written by a South African years ago but it has relevance today too. A hajee begins to pack his bags to return home after completing his hajj.............Shaitaan intrudes......\"Home sweet home, by next Friday, you will be home.\" Body feels shattered and reminds Shaitaan that he had promised never to interfere with it in the future...........%0D%0A%0D%0AShaitaan responds, \" It is useless for a sheep to pass a resolution on vegetarianism whilst the wolf remains of a different opinion. You are a sheep, what about wolves in your town? Though most of the elders and youth believe we do not exist, which makes our labour easier, but we are friends to all, and not foes. In your case my chief's orders are not to interfere with your future activities, and I promise to abide\", said the accursed Shaitaan in a voice that sounded like a challenge. \"I came to issue a final warning. That grey beard you have kept, it looks ugly, shave it off, before you reach home. Your friends will mock at you, and call you a holy harpooner. Besides, beards are not compulsory in Islam, and your hadj is now completed,\" said shaitaan.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Body said, \"You may be right, but I have no intention to remove it.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AShaitaan said, \" In the olden days the razors were unobtainable and people kept beards under those circumstances. A man like Abu Jahel kept an eight inch beard and many other personalities of high ranking unbelievers also kept beards. Since the invention of the razors, the greatest poets, most of the five time Namaazies, and the Intellectuals of the world shave off their beards (clean). You, an uneducated, obstinate, orthodox simpleton do you know more of Islam than those learned ones? Are they fools as you are? Listen, a monkey is an organised sarcasm upon the human race, Why look like one?\" said Shaitaan the accursed.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"To be seventy years young is sometimes far more cheerful and hopeful than to be forty years old. Shave off the beards clean, dye the hair black, wear a smart suit, a shirt and a lovely tie with continental shoes and you will look eleven years younger. You wife looks younger and Islam is an elastic bag, many innovations could be added.\"%0D%0A%0D%0ABody said, \" I must admit, there are two sorts of doctors, one who practices with the brain, the other with the tongue but you are a combination of both, truly exceptional. Why should I allow my colleagues and others to mock at me or call me a pretending holy man........... My wife looks younger, besides beards are not compulsory. Thanks for your timely reminder.\"%0D%0A%0D%0ABody commanded the hands, \" Please take a razor from the bag and shave off this beard.\" The hands obeyed and the beard came off. \"Ah!, that's better, I feel fresh and young\", said the Body and then turned to a mirror, saying, \"Do you know that I have always considered my face a convenience, rather than an ornament, but with a clean shave, it shines like a sixpence. Thank you indeed, for your efforts\", said Body to the hands.%0D%0A%0D%0AShaitaan said, \"Young men think old men are fools, but old men know that young men are fools\".......Shaitaan was satisfied with his success. The pious men and women of the world know his auspicious insinuations, his perpetual dictates and sweet murmuring have converted many a learned person to his school of law and thought.%0D%0A%0D%0AShaitaan continued, \"Flatterers make cream-cheese from chalk, but we don't. There are three things people in future will clamour for. Novelty, novelty, novelty.%0D%0A%0D%0AOne needs to ponder over the above as I move on to a later stage in this duel. The Soul has now entered the fray and explains why Muslims have reached the present stage of degradation and slavery. \"................. for centuries we influenced the world not only in politics but in the domains of science, art and culture. This prestige and leadership was achieved by those pious bearded gentlemen with the assistance of their pious women. One had the strength to defy six to ten, but presently it is vice versa. We abandoned the Islamic virtues, and precepts\" ...........\"..We discarded moderation and indulged in extremes. Men and women lost love and peace, so vices, shamelessness, hatred and jealousy entered in our present lives\"........\"Muslims surrendered themselves mentally to the rising force of Europe because Muslims stopped living as Muslims............both men and women indulged themselves in lavish splendour and vices, brushing aside the Basic principles of Islam.....\"%0D%0A%0D%0ABody interrupted, saying, \"Can you please narrate to us some of the advantages of the beard.\" Soul said, \" When Shaitaan said that razors were not obtainable therefore people kept beards, he is a liar. During the time of Prophet Lot (AS) people used to shave and razors were obtainable. For their unnatural practices, they were wiped out....\"%0D%0A%0D%0AProphets Moosa and Isa (AS) and Nabi (sallallaahu alayhi wassallam) introduced beards again. But at the turn of the 19th century, shaving restarted and people in Europe were taxed for keeping beards for financial gains.%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi (sallallaahu alayhi wassallam) advised that beards must be kept proportionate and equal on all sides. The beard brightens the eye-sight and doubles the physical strength and increases courage in youths. The beards should be kept clean and oiled. The beards without side-whiskers are not recommended in Islam...............The beard enhances the beauty of a male and lends respect and gravity to the appearance....very fine beards are not acceptable.%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi (sallaallaahu alayhi wassallam) is reported to have said that \" The best of the youths are those who imitate their old men. And the worst of the old men are those who imitate their youths.\" (Tibrani)%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen Shaitaan told Body that beards gave the appearance of a monkey, he is a notorious liar. In fact the beard gives an appearance of a lion to the males, and without it they appear as Springboks,\" said the Soul.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala guide you to follow the Sunnahs, ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A1SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
