  "question": "What is the symbolic meaning of the different postures during Prayer?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nI have heard a few theories in this subject, one of being that the postures\nRepresent the servitude of the different creations of Allah. Thus Qiyaam\nRepresents the trees, Rukoo, the four legged animals, Sajdah, those animals\nwho crawl and Jalsah, the mountains. However, I have been unable to document\nthis from authentic sources due to lack of reference\n\nMaterial. Primarily, salaat is as it is because it has been taught to us in\nThis way. Nabi (saw) stated \"Perform salaah as you see me do so''\n(mishkaat). Trying to grasp the symbolic meaning of salaah, although\nunderstandable , can have no impact on ones imaan, therefore not\ndeserving of great concern.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
