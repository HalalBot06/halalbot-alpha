  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni wanted to know wat i can do. when ever i start tp pray all these thoughts come to my mind and i forget where i am in my prayer. and i gets really annoying. because i want to pray with all my attention but cant. please tell me wat i can to.\n\nsalaams.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nA person experiences two types of thoughts; voluntary and involuntary.\n\nVoluntary thoughts in Salaat are bad and defeats the spirituality in Salaat. If you are experiencing involuntary thoughts, that is natural and at most could be controlled with paying attention in Salaat. You cannot remove the involuntary thoughts. Such thoughts will come and you should not be annoyed with that. That is another way of Shaytaan distracting you. You should simply ignore such thoughts.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
