  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a very general question. I was recently fined AD$500 for not wearing a seatbelt. I felt very bad that i lost so much money due to my carelessness. I cried so much. Is it right of me to have done so?We should always believe in Allah, right?and not cry for such things? we shouldnt feel for all these things?\n\nAlso for other loses in my Life i also have a weak feeling in my heart. Am i doing wrong?What should i do?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nFeeling sad, being depressed and crying are all natural qualities of a human being. Each and every human being experiences these emotions despite knowing that Allah Ta’ala controls all affairs. Tears that come at the time of difficulty is not due to disbelief in Taqdeer (decree) of Almighty Allah, instead it is due to one’s natural disposition and emotion.\n\nThe greatest of Allah’s creation, Rasululah عليه و سلم صلى الله, also becomes emotional at the demise of his grandchild.\n\n\nعن أسامة بن زيد أن ابنة لرسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أرسلت إليه وأنا معه وسعد وأحسب أبيا أن ابنى أو بنتى قد حضر فاشهدنا فأرسل يقرئ السلام فقال  قل لله ما أخذ وما أعطى وكل شىء عنده إلى أجل  فأرسلت تقسم عليه فأتاها فوضع الصبى فى حجر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ونفسه تقعقع ففاضت عينا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال له سعد ما هذا قال  إنها رحمة وضعها الله فى قلوب من يشاء وإنما يرحم الله من عباده الرحماء\n\nNarrated from Usama bin Zaid رضي الله عنهthat the daughter of Rasululahصلى الله عليه و سلم sent for him whilst I, Sa’dرضي الله عنه and I think Ubaiرضي الله عنه were with him. She said my son (or daughter) is indeed in the throes of death so hurry to us. (Rasululah عليه و سلم صلى الله) sent the messenger back, conveying Salaams to her and instructed her to say, “For Allah is that which He takes and that which He gives and everything by Him has an appointed time.” She sent a message back urging him to come. He comes to her and the child is placed in Rasululah’s عليه و سلم صلى الله lap whilst he (the child) was breathing his last. Tears flowed from the eyes of Rasululah عليه و سلم صلى الله. So Sa’dرضي الله عنه said to him “what is this?” He said “Indeed it is a Rahma (mercy) Allah places in the heart of whoever He wishes and definitely Allah has mercy on His servants who has mercy.” (Abu Dawud)\n\nAllah Ta’ala states in the Holy Quran:\n\nوَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُمْ بِشَيْءٍ مِنَ الْخَوْفِ وَالْجُوعِ وَنَقْصٍ مِنَ الْأَمْوَالِ وَالْأَنْفُسِ وَالثَّمَرَاتِ وَبَشِّرِ الصَّابِرِينَ\n\n“And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and loss of wealth and lives and fruit and give glad tidings to the patient.” (Surah Baqarah v.155)\n\nTherefore, you should not feel weak in your heart, always bear in mind that this is a test from Allah and experienced by all. And glad tidings are for those who are patient.\n\nAlso be cautious; try to abstain from those things that incur loss. We live in a world of Asbaab (means). That is, Allah has given us free will, the right to do as we please and has also laid down rules to be followed. As humans, for example, we either choose to share or be stingy; we choose to love or hate; we choose to give benefit or cause harm; we choose to do good or evil. Therefore, we should adopt such means which will benefit us, and protect ourselves from that which will cause harm. And at the same time, we should place our trust in Almighty Allah and not in the means we have adopted.\n\nعن عوف بن مالك  أنه حدثهم أن النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم قضى بين رجلين فقال المقضي عليه لما أدبر  حسبي الله و نعم الوكيل فقال النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم \n\n إن الله عز و جل يلوم على العجز و لكن عليك بالكيس فإن غلبك أمر فقل حسبي الله و نعم الوكيل\n\n \n\nNarrated by Auf ibni Maalik, he said to them that Nabiصلى الله عليه و سلم decided judicially between two men. The one who lost the case, when turning away said “Allah is sufficient for me and a good guardian.” Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلمsaid “Indeed Allah will blame you for your incapability. Instead you should be intelligent! When a matter overpowers you; then says “Allah is sufficient for me and a good guardian.” (Shu’bul Iman)\n\nIt is clear from the above example that we have to adopt means before placing our trust in Almighty Allah. Merely expecting things to happen in our favour without effort is inadequate. Therefore, we should always adopt the correct means to protect ourselves from losses and then place our trust in Allah Ta’ala.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
