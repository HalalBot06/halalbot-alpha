  "question": "i am belgian converted women since 6 months, can i celebrate christmas with family or not?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour reversion to Islam is encouraging. May Allah Ta'ala accept it and keep you steadfast, Aameen.\n\nAccording to the Shari'ah (Islamic Law), it is not permissible to celebrate Christmas or any occasion which is a salient feature of the non-Muslims. You know your family well and you should apply your discretion in dealing with them. We suggest you have to practise on Islam and maintain family ties without compromising on your Islamic values. This attitude and conduct should be presented to the family with wisdom as soon possible so that you do not be burdened in future.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
