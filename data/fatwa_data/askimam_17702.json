  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMufti sab iam now in very bad condition of Imaan due to shaitaan acts , i dont know why it has happen , last month i went Jamath and i was very much focused on the Allah's order following Nabi Saw sunnats now suddenly my mind is diverting towrads the shaitaan acts like seeing non mehrams & watching television thinking bad thinks .so pls advise me what i have to do to stop and focus towrds ALLAH\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is very encouraging to know that you went out in Jamaat and you were focused in fulfilling the commands of Allah and his Rasool salallahu alayhi wasallam. It is obvious that the shaytaan efforts on you will be even greater. That is an indication that your Jamaat work and your intention was accepted. That is why the shaytaan has increased his pressure on you. You should defy the shaytaan and go out in Jamaat more often.\n\nWhen you are not in Jamaat, stay in the company of pious people. Such an environment will keep you away from wrong and evil. Ultimately you yourself will have to fight your nafs. That is the greatest Jihad. Allah will never make you do something that you cannot do. Most definitely you can go against your nafs and defy your shaytaan. DO it a few times and you will get used to it. You will also enjoy the sweetness of Imaan in your heart. All that is required is a little courage and firm determination.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
