  "question": "Should a woman pray with face covered if men are around?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen a woman is in the state of ehraam, if she covers her face in such a way that the cloth does not touch her face, (1)does she have to keep the veil down during the tawaaf and sai? (2) If she is praying salaah in an open area, and there are na-mehrams present, should she lift her face veil up? (3)can she pray salaah with her veil down? Will the salaah be valid? JazakAllah kair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'The Ihraam of a female is\nher face (keep the face uncovered) and the Ihraam of a male is her head\n(keep the head uncovered).' However, it is advisable for a female to cover\nher face during Ihraam in such a way that the cloth does not touch her face.\nThat is generally practiced by drawing the veil from the petruding front\npart of a sun cap.\n\nA female may perform her Tawaaf and Sa'ee with the veil down as explained\nabove. When performing Salaat with the veil, it (the veil) will touch her\nface during Sajdah. Furthermore, it may be difficult to perform Sajdah with\nthe sun cap, therefore, it is advisable that a female perform her Salaat in\nher room or in the female section of the Haram.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
