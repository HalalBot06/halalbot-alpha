  "question": "Is NOOR or NUR one of Allah s.w.t’s names? I couldn’t find NOOR in the 99 names of Allah s.w.t. Also, are Angels made of Noor, which is Allah s.w.t.’s attribute? How exactly?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease explain each of the above.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Noor or Nur is one name. the difference is only in the spelling . both mean light.\n\n2. This is in the sole knowledge of Allah. We cannot express our opinions as to how Allah created angels from light. The Ulama state conceal those things that Allah has concealed. Those issues that Allah kept ambiguous, do not try to delve into them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
