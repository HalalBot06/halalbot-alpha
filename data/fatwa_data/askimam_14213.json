  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissable to undergo OTOPLASTY (pinning prominent ears back)? I do not even wear a toppee as I feel uncomfortable; socially it is embarrasing too. I believe the undergoing of Otoplasty will give me more confidence and facilitate the marriage process for me. I realise we are created as Allah has willed, but it is a day to day problem for me and I cannot accept it especially as there is a cure there for me. Finally I have tried to overcome this for 20 years but I seriously am considering Otoplasty. Please advise\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn principle, it is not permissible to alter any limb of one’s body as this will tantamount to altering the creation of Allah. (Qur’aan). However, if any limb of one’s body is positioned unnaturally, then one may undergo a surgery to restore its natural state on condition thee is no fear of causing more harm to the body through surgery.\n\nIt should be noted that one’s personal opinion will not be considered regarding the abnormality of one’s limbs. One should consult at least 3 upright fairminded scholars/elders of one’s area and should adopt the view of the majority, i.e. if the majority say one’s ears are unnatural, then one should undergo surgery and if majority say one’s ears are natural, then one should abstain from surgery.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
