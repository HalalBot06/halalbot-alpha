  "question": "Urine drops come out due to sneezing. Do i have to do Ghusl?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhile Iam at office it happens some time that some drop of urine comes out during sneezing is this makes Gusul obligatory or it is oky to change the cloths later in home as it is not immedietly possible to chane cloths or perform Gusul.\n\nPleas answer this question asÂ due to this I have missed my Sallaths.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nUrine drops coming out does not invalidate ghusal. Urine is impure and it invalidates wuzu. If urine soils your undergarment, then your clothing will become impure. For example, Salah with impure clothing will be invalid. You could avoid your undergarments from becoming impure by placing a tissue that will absorb the urine. At the time of salah, you should remove the soiled tissue and make wuzu and perform salah. If your undergarment gets soiled with urine, you should wash the soiled portion three times and squeeze it out each time and perform salah. You should not miss any salah or let any salah become qaza.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
