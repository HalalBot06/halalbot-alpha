  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Can we read quran at makrooh times? (i.e while sun-rise, sun-set and mid-day). 2. In our country 'Sahar' ends at 5:20 and Fajr starts at 5:30 (for Shafee). My question is, can we pray tahajjud and witr between 5:20 and 5:30 or they should be prayed before 5:20? Are we allow to read quran at this time? If I prayed witr in this time Do i Need to repeat it as Qada?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Yes, it is permissible to recite the Qur?aan at these times.\n\n2. You should determine at which time is the exact Subh-e-Saadiq. Usually the time of Sahr is given a few minutes before the exact Subh-e-Saadiq. This is done for precaution. Similarly, the beginning time of Fajr is given as a few minutes after the actual Subh-e-Saadiq. One can pray the Witr and Tahajjud anytime before the actual Subh-e-Saadiq. The Witr read during or after the Subh-e-Saadiq does not have to be repeated. However, it is wrong to delay until after Subh-e-Saadiq. One may recite the Qur?aan during this time.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
