  "question": "My question regards the payment of Zakaat. I understand that if you have assets",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSlmz\nMy question regards the payment of Zakaat. I understand that if you have assets\nit is subject to zakaat. I have cash on hand, in a bank account and invested in\nunit trusts. The source of the money is gifts and as provided by family, I have\nno income yet as I am still studying. Is the money and investments I have\nsubject to Zakaat?\n\nLooking forward to your response,\nShukran, Wassalaam\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nIf a person possesses 612.35 grams of silver or 87.479 grams of gold or any currency that equals the value of this amount of gold or silver, and this wealth remains in his possession for a complete year, then on the expiry of this year it will be Wajib on him to give Zakat.  If his wealth is less than this, Zakat will not be Wajib.  If it is more than this, Zakat will still be Wajib. Therefore if the cash on hand, the amount in the bank and shares are equivalent or more than the minimum Zakatable amount and you do not have liabilities, then you should pay 2 ½ % on the full amount as explained above.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
