  "question": "What is allowed after Nikah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy question is in regard to Nikah. In a year the Nikah is to take place but marriage won't take place for a few years afterward. Both will finish their education. I was wondering what is and what is not allowed after the actual Nikah in Islam (though both will be separate for some period of time)?????\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari'ah, once a Nikah (Islamic marriage contract) takes\nplace, both husband and wife may communicate with one another freely. There\nis no restrictions after the Nikah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
