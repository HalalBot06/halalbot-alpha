  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n\nFor a woman to take the husband's name after marraige, is it based on shareeah? If not, then what is the right way please?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\n \n\nIslam is a religion that emphasises on ethics and social conduct. Every sphere of Muslims life is governed by the above. Addressing the husband with respect is social conduct and forms part of Shari’ah. It is disrespectful for a wife to address her husband with his first name. Our illustrious Fuqahaa (Jurists) have stated that it is Makruh (disliked) for the wife to address her husband with his first name. Rather, she should address him with some word of respect.\n\n(Radd Al-Muhtar, vol 6, pg 418, HM Sa’eed)\n\n \n\nA son is responsible to address his father with respect, as the father has a greater right over his child. Similarly, a wife is responsible to address her husband with respect, as the husband has a greater right over her.\n\n \n\n \n\n( ويكره أن يدعو الرجل أباه وأن تدعو المرأة زوجها باسمه )(الدر المختار)\n\n( قوله ويكره أن يدعو إلخ ) بل لا بد من لفظ يفيد التعظيم كيا سيدي ونحوه لمزيد حقهما على الولد والزوجة ، وليس هذا من التزكية ، لأنها راجعة إلى المدعو بأن يصف نفسه  يفيدها لا إلى الداعي المطلوب منه التأدب مع من هو فوقه .(رد المحتار)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
