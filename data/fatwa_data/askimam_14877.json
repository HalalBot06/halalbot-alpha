  "question": "Is it permissible for husband and wife to perform salah standing next to each other? How is it permissible for them to pray together?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissible for husband and wife to perform salah standing next to each other? How is it permissible for them to pray together?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nIf the husband and wife are performing their own and independent salah, they may stand as they wish, next to each other or apart from each other. If they are performing salah jointly, then the wife must be behind the husband. She cannot stand next to him or that will invalidate his salah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
