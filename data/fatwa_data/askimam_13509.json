Brother, do not despair, nor give up hope in Allah Ta'ala. It has been noted increasingly that many Muslims who have settled in the western world have given up on their deen. Instead of remaining the vicegerents of Allah Ta'ala as they have been appointed by their Creator, they choose to follow the ways of the Kuffar and they abandon the task which was appointed for them. Allah Ta'ala does not need us, we need Him. He cannot be abandoned. In fact we abandon ourselves into shaitaan's arms and we know it not.\n\nClearly Allah Ta'ala tells us that there are none so 'blind, deaf and dumb' as those who aware of all the signs that exist out there there and still we will not 'look', 'hear' and 'accept/comprehend'. It is as if they have become totally senseless. The loss is not Allah Ta'ala's for He can suffer no loss. The loss is to the person who abandons his deen. He proudly struts about the earth claiming victory and freedom. What a loss this person will be in when he needs his Creator the most on 'that day' when no other help will be available.. But then, Allah Ta'ala will have already turned away from the deviated person.\n\nÂ \n\nIt is understandable that you are experiencing dissonance considering that your father is/was your role model. We all like to believe that our parents are the ones who will never do wrong or go astray. You have had a rude shock and awakening. Do not blame yourself nor think that this is your fault. Only Allah Ta'ala grants hidayah, so do accept that this is your parent's test in life. They have to make their choices and bear the consequences.\n\nYou have to remember that your father is an adult and so are you.\n\nYou are well versed with the Quran and you fully understand what you have read and learnt. You understand that on the day of Qiyamah each one of us will look out for ourselves only. We will abandon our own parents and parents will abandon their children whilst trying to save themselves from Allah Ta'ala's wrath. You will not be held accountable for the actions of any other person. You will have to account for your own deeds and words. Your dad will carry his burden and you will carry yours. Let me remind you that you are an adult and expected to make your choices and decisions. You do not have to allow anybody to influence you nor force you to give up what you know to be the truth.\n\nIt would appear that your father (parents) are now your test in life. This is also not unexpected. Think of Ebrahim (alayhis salaam). His father was a pagan and he refused to accept the truth. By all means, try to convince your father with wisdom and tact. He was born a Muslim and that although he has freedom of choice, he needs to 'revisit' his origins. I know it must be painful for you but try to convince him and leave the rest to Allah Ta'ala. Please do turn to your Creator as you did in the past. Allah Ta'ala will not turn away from you unless you do so first.You know this only too well. You are faced with many challenges and obstacles in the west. This is perhaps the worst and the strongest challenge you have ever faced. You ask how you can get your faith back. I do not think you have lost it. It has just had a severe jolt and perhaps a 'wake up' call. Insha'allah, with perseverance, firm faith, consistent dua, salaah, istigfar and sincerity, you will overcome this overture from shaitaan to mislead you. Please write again if you feel the need to do so. May Allah Ta'ala protect your imaan and return your parents to \"Haq\". Ameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nSister Fadila\nSOCIAL DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
