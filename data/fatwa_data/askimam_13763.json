  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nRecently we have informed the Muslim Public that the use of paint brushes made from pig hair is not allowed. What would be the position of people who had pirchased these brushes before the notice and would like to use them to paint their houses etc.\n\nAlternative synthetic / nylon brushes are not readily available in Malawi currently.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nBenefit may not be derived from any part of the pig. Hence, the paint brushes must be disposed off. The Muslim community should be mobilized to create alternatives. (Shaami vol.5 pg.71; HM Saeed)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
