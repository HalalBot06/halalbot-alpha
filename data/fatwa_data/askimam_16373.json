  "question": "Working as an IT manager in the asset management company",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am working as a Project Manager in an Islamic Bank in Dubai and going through some unavoidable situation since I have been given different responsibility which is not as per my original conversation with my management and also not my core competencies and when I somehow managed to handle it but still struggling with my senior management on daily basis. I have requested to change my responsibility many a times with my core competencies but they are ignoring it by making false promises from past 2 years. Due to rise in living expenses in Dubai and responsibility to look after my family, it is really hard to make it as I am not getting any raise as well.\n\nRecently I got an opportunity to work in Saudi Arabia as IT Manager in an Asset management company which is recently got shaped up. My main responsibility is to manage project for asset management application from IT side and also look after / build IT infrastructure setup completely which includes Server setup, LAN / WAN setup, Email Servers, etc.. This company has been formed by two major banks as an Asset Management Company.  \n\n By accepting to work here, I will be back to my core work and hopeful (Insha Allah) could gain much experience and going forward want to part of fully Shariah complaint companies.\n\nI don’t have much idea about the process of the company(Asset Management) and how it manages the core business, therefore humble request with you to kindly advise me under my current circumstances if it is permissible to work in Asset Management Company and are there any acceptable roles such where my responsibility revolves around IT domain \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is permissible for you to work as an IT manager in the asset management company and fulfill all the roles explained in your query.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
