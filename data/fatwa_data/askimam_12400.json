  "answer": "QUESTION\ni am a girl and i love a boy.we both love each other a lot and cannot think of living without eachother.we never met.we have just seen each others photos. we only talk on phone and chat on internet.we haven't told our parents about this.Q1)should we tell our parents that we love each other and want to marry?Q2)if they disagree what should be done? Because islam also says that a girl should not be forced to marry a boy whom she does not like so i dont want to think of any one to marry except him.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFirstly, you should know that your relationship with this boy is Haraam. Allah Ta?ala states, ?Do not come close to adultery?? (Sura17 Aayat32).\n\nYou must immediately terminate all correspondence with him. You then must inform your parents your feelings regarding the boy and your intentions to marry. If they disagree then you should listen marriage is not just the union of boy and girl, it is the joining of 2 families. Your parents will see whether you are a suitable match and compatible. Once Hadhrat Umar [Radhiallaahu anhu] commanded his son, Abdullah ibn Umar [Radhiallaahu anhu] to divorce his wife. Abdullah did not want to do this and was reprimanded by Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam]\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
