  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI got married recently and cook for my husband now,but whatever i cook it will turn out to be bad to eat.and my husband dont like tht.i want to win his heart by making good food. Plz suggest me any dua so that  the food should become delicious.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nMake dua to Allah Ta’ala that He makes you a good cook. Recite Bismillah before cooking. Whilst cooking try to be in the state of wudhu. Try to recite as much as Durood as possible. You could also ask some relatives or friends to show you how to cook good food. Practice makes perfect. Enquire from your husband his preferences of food and perhaps discussing the issue with his mother may be useful.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl. Ishaq E.
