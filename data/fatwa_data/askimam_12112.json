  "question": "If I miss my fazr prayer, do I have to make up my 2 rakat sunnah prayer and the 2 rakat faraj prayer or do I just make up the 2 rakat faraj prayer?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, there is no Qada for missed Sunnah Salaah. However, the Sunnats of Fajr are emphasized in the Hadith. Rasulullah (SAW) said ?do not leave out the two rakaats of Fajr (Sunnats) even though the horses trample upon you?.\n\nTherefore according to Shariah, the sunnats of Fajr will be read only if it has been missed together with the Fardh. If the sunnats were left out due to joining the farz jamaat, the sunnats will not be read (Tahtaawi, Shaami)\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
