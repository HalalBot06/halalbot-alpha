  "question": "Can a person who has comitted apostasy many times, and has done tawbah each time he committed apostasy, still do tawbah for having committed apostasy (again)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nQ1 : Can a person who has comitted apostasy many times, and has done tawbah each time he committed apostasy, still do tawbah (sincere) for having committed apostasy (again)? Will it be accepted by Allah, even though he did it many times, and did tawbah for it almost each time? Will Allah forgive him? Are the doors of repentance still open for this person? Q2 : If the person, mentioned in Q1, does tawbah for apostasy, but, thereafter, leads a sinful life (pornography, etc.), but doesn't indulge in apostasy, will he be considered Muslim or kaafir? Q3 : Does this person have to repeat all his past prayers and fasts? What else does he have to do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Allah Ta?ala, our Nourisher and Sustainer, has created us in the most excellent creations. Allah always wishes good for his bondsmen and women. Therefore, He constantly sent messengers and prophets to guide mankind to the straight path. Allah Ta?ala says in the noble Qur?aan, ?Verily for every nation we sent a guide.?%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore, there is absolutely nothing to feel despondent of. Allah Ta?ala says in Surah Yusuf, ?Verily no one is despondent of the mercy of Allah except the polytheists.? Allah Ta?ala further explains that He shall forgive every sin except that sin of ascribing partners to him.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Shirk (ascribing partners to Allah) is untolerable by Allah Ta?ala, but His mercy knows no bounds. If a person ascribes partners to Allah and thereafter makes ?sincere? Tawbah (repentance), Allah out of His sheer grace and mercy forgives this person. (Shaami vol.4 pg.231; HM Saeed). However, it is definitely not the sign of sincerity for a person to repeat this wrong doing again.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Yes, a person shall still be considered a Muslim. However, it is unbecoming of a Muslim to get involved in such evils. It is totally forbidden in Islam to look at pictures. (Shaami vol.4 pg.252; HM Saeed)%0D%0A%0D%0A4. No, it is not necessary to repeat your past prayers and fast. However, the Amal of Hajj (pilgrimage) has to be repeated. (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
