  "question": "Why do people pray ahead of Imam during Taraweeh prayer in the Haram in Makkah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1.I have seen that during Taraweeh prayer the Imam in the Holy Mosque in Makkah prayers under the roofed area while theree are about 20-30 rows in the open who are much closer to the Kabah although not directly in front of the Imam, does this not invalidate their prayer because shouldnt they be level or behind the Imam? 2.Does either cutting your hair or clipping nails break your Wudhu. If not is it preferable to do either of these things with Wudhu or without?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If the Imam is not in the same direction as you are i.e. he is facing a different wall of the kaa'bah, then you could perform salah in front of him and it will be perfectly correct, as you are only classified as being in front of him if both of you are facing the same direction. (Imdaadul Fattah Pg. 463, Tahtaawi Pg. 418)\n\n2. Neither cutting your hairs nor clipping your nails breaks wudhu. It is preferable not to be in a state of Janabat ( ie. not requiring Ghusl) when removing hair or nails. (Ahsanul Fatawa Vol.2 pg. 38)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
