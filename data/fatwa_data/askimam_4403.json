  "question": "As-Salaam-u-Alaikum. My question concerns the Iqaamah of Salaat. I also have a question on the dress that can be used. Please read the details concerning these two questions.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nQuestion 1) I have been told that when the Iqaamah is given for the commencement of the Fard prayer in Jamaat, you should abandon any other Sunnah or Nafl without saying salaam. There is also an exeption to this(I think if you have already read 2 or more rakaats). Please correct any inaccuracies and give evidence about this ruling. 2) It is prohibited in Islam to wear red clothes. Are we allowed to have eg) white clothes with red writing or designs. Also, I remember reading that the prophet dressed his 2 grandsons(Imam Hassan and Hussain) in red and green for Eid. Does this mean that children can wear red clothes? Jazakallahu-khair. As-Salaam-u-Alaikum\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA person should not commence any Nafil or Sunnah salaah if the congregation\nfor fard salaah is about to commence. That excludes the Sunnats of Fajr\nsalaat, which must be performed even though the Fajr salaah has commenced.\nIf one commenced any other Sunnah or Nafil Salaah before any Fard\ncongregational prayer, he should not terminate it, rather complete it as\nsoon as possible and join the congregation.\nIt is makrooh for males to wear pure red. If the red is mixed with another\ncolour, then it is not makrooh.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
