So can you please send me the procedure that how to offer the kaffarah... I request you to please answer my question as soon an possible...\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nThere is no doubt that Allah Ta’ala is Merciful, Compassionate,  Gracious and  Forgiving. There is no comparison to Allah Ta’ala in His mercy, compassion, forgiveness and acceptance of repentance.\n\nHazrat Saeed bin Jubair (Radiallahu Anhu) reports from Ibn Abbaas (Radiallahu Anhuma) that there were some people who had killed a number of people unjustly and had committed a lot of shameful acts. They came to Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallalm) and submitted to him, “The religion you invite us to, is no doubt very good, but we have a problem. We are continuosly reminded  about all those sins we have already comitted.  If we become Muslims, is there hope that our repentance will be accepted. Thereupon Allah Ta’ala revealed this verse :-\n\nSay (on My behalf), ―O servants of Mine who have acted recklessly against their own selves, do not despair of Allah‘s mercy. Surely, Allah will forgive all sins. Surely, He is the One who is the Most-Forgiving, the Very-Merciful. [39:53]\n\nThe outcome of this verse comes to be that, well before death arrives, the repentance made from sins, no matter how serious, even from kufr-(disbelief) and shirk-(ascribing of partners) to Allah Ta’ala readily gets accepted.\n\n(Ma’ariful Qur’an Pg 574)\n\nIn another verse Allah Ta’ala makes mention of a simple solution, yet dynamic in its outcome i.e.\n\nإِنَّ الْحَسَنَاتِ يُذْهِبْنَ السَّيِّئَاتِ ذَلِكَ ذِكْرَى لِلذَّاكِرِينَ\n\n Surely, good deeds erase bad deeds. That is a reminder for the mindful. [11:114]\n\n \n\nAnother aspect to consider about forgiveness is that doing good deeds such as giving your time and money to charity, is a way for Allah Ta’ala to automatically blot out your sins without you even asking.\n\nHazrat Abu Bakr (Radiallahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said, if a Muslim regrettably falls into some sin, he should make wudhu and offer two raka’ats of nafl salaah, that sin will be forgiven. This is known as salaatul taubah. (prayer of repentance)\n\n (Musnad Ahmad & Ibn Kathir)\n\n \n\nThe act of fornication is a major sin. In order for major sins to be expiated and forgiven, sincere repentance is a condition. First, you need to recognize that what you have done is wrong.Second, you need to be remorseful of the action. Third, you need to acquire a firm determination that you will sincerely try hard never to do the act again, and finally, you need to beseech Allah Ta’ala for forgiveness.\n\n \n\nThere is no kaffarah to be given for zina in order for the marriage to be valid.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
