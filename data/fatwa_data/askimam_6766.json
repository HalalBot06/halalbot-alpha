  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have been praying istekharah about this matter and so far I don't know what do i get so that I know for sure I should continue with this or I shouldn't. Please let me know what are the signs of istekharah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly find attached, ?How to Make Istikhaara?.\n\nIf you are uncertain, you should continue with the Istikhaara. You should also distinguish between natural fear and substantial reservation for the uncertainty. If you do not have any substantial reservation, but only have natural fear, then you should place your trust in Allah and proceed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
