  "question": "What is there in Islam for Woman? Is wrong not to believe in the Haddith's but only in the Quran?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI reverted 1 year ago and have received no help from my husband or other's with regards to learning the religion. I therefore resorted to trying to teach myself via internet and books. From my extensive research I have discovered to my horror that Woman in Islam are nothing but \"slaves\" to men and in particular to their Husbands! And that our fate lays in man's hands and not in our own! Is the \"pretty picture\" that books like \"What Islam is!\" paint of the religion just a smoke screen to the true nature of Islam? Please help me, am I being brainwashed by propaganda or is their really nothing in Islam for woman? If their is please tell me! Also is it wrong for me NOT to believe in the \"teachings\" of the Haddith's as I believe that the authenticity of the Haddith's is no better than that of the Christian Bible! Is it wrong for me to only believe in the Quran? I am so confused! Wa Salaam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is everything for women in Islam. No code of life gives more dignity to women than Islam. It is sad to hear that you have not found support from your husband or others. Communicate with the true and authentic Ulama, and you will find your doubts will be answered. The true value of what Islam has to offer will only be appreciated when you truly adopt Islam as your way of life. Please find attached an article that may dispel your doubts.%0D%0A%0D%0AIs there is a single teaching of Christianity that can be traced upto Nabi Eesa (Alayhis salaam). On the other hand, the minutest action of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) can be traced right from the contemporary Ulama upto Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), for example, we can describe how Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) drank water. We can give you a complete chain of narrators who informed us thereof. We can even provide a detail biography of each narrator, which will satisfy you that he%2Fshe was a reliable person, whose word can be accepted. This is what is meant by Ahaadith, the actions and statements of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) being transmitted to us via reliable sources.%0D%0A%0D%0ATake away the Hadith and you have no Islam left. The Qur?aan cannot be understood without the Hadith. Your comparison with the bible is far out. Is there even one verse of the bible that has a complete chain of narrators to prove that it is in fact the words of Nabi Eesa (Alayhis salaam). Find attached an article on the ?Authority of the Sunnah?. %0D%0A%0D%0AIf you have any further doubts, please feel free to write to us.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Imraan Vawda%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
