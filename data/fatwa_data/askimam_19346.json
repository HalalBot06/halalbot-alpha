  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf someone talks to their wife on the phone they argue and then it calms down but the husband says I don't wanna be with you anymore (but he does not intend divorce at all he just says it and he knows that saying Talaq counts as divorce so he does not mean it in a divorce way at all) and then when he asks her the next day if she heard what he says she says that she didnt.\n\nMy question is that even if she did hear it does that count as a divorce (well I have no knowledge and I just keep getting satanic whispers so I had to ask) ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nThe statement I don’t want to be with you does not constitute divorce.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Ishaaq E. Moosa\nBenoni.\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
