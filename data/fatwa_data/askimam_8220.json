  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamAlaikum, I live away from my parents with my husband. Alhumdulillah we are both trying to practice Islam completely. We believe in not take taking pictures as it is Haraam. I would like to know if I can see my parents on a WebCamera? They are also missing us ,and want us to get one too so that they can see us.We think its not allowed in Islam. But is it ok if we are watching only our mehrams? Please explain if not. JazakAllah!!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly find below information on the actual operation of a webcamera from an electric engineer.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn view of the abovementioned procedure, it is not permissible to use a webcamera.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AThe way a webcam (camera used with a computer on the%0D%0AWeb) is as follows:%0D%0A%0D%0A1) The camera takes a still image snapshot every few%0D%0Aseconds. This is a digital camera so the data can be%0D%0Atransferred to a computer.%0D%0A%0D%0A2) A software program extracts the picture in digital format and generates a file on the PC.%0D%0A%0D%0A3) The file is then transmitted over the internet%0D%0Ausing a FIle Transfer protocol (FTP) program.%0D%0ADepending on the software capability the image on the recepients side can be automatically updated, so looks like real live transmission. The update rate is programmable and can be made fast enough that the image looks live.%0D%0A%0D%0ASo based on the above three principles, the image is a still image taken every few seconds, it is also%0D%0Astored, not by hand but by the software and then is%0D%0Atransferred over the internet using a File Transfer%0D%0AProgram.%0D%0A%0D%0ABy the time the image is gone to the recepient, it%0D%0Aseems that its live as all the data capture if fast%0D%0Aand automated, processing and storage and transfer is done by the software.%0D%0A"
