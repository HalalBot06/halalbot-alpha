  "answer": "QUESTION\nIsmail Jhazbhai Hunt Lascaris Advertising Private Bag X6 Westville 3630\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe are unable to locate an entry for 'Mishka' in our dictionaries. A few\nclose matches are as follows:\n1. Mishq (fem. Mishqah - Arabic): tall and thin\n2. Misk or Miskah (Arabic): musk\n3. Mushk (Urdu): musk\n\nMishka is common female name among non-Muslim Russians whose meaning we are\nnot aware of this. It is, thus, doubtful that Mishka is a Muslim name.\nMuslim names should proclaim their bearers religious identity without doubt.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
