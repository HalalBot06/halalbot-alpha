  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) It is said that your dua is accept during jumma. When is it u make your dua if any action made during the khutbah voids your jumma.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are many opinions regarding the actual time when du’aa is accepted on a Friday.\n\nOne opinion is during Jumu’ah time when the Imaam comes to deliver the Khutbah until the end of Salaat. It is not permissible to make verbal du’aa during the Khutbah. That is the time to listen attentively to the Khutbah. One may make du’aa between the two Khutbahs or between the Khutbah and Jumu’ah Salaat or after Jumu’ah Salaat. Another opinion regarding the time of acceptance of du’aa on a Friday is after Asr Salaat till before sunset. This opinion is also supported by Hadith.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
