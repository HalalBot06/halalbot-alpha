On the fourth day, owing to extreme thirst - as he saw%0D%0Adeath - he sat down facing the Qiblah.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs he sat there, sleep overtook him and in a dream he saw a man coming%0D%0Atowards him with his hands stretched out to him saying, 'Here take my hand.'%0D%0AThen he spoke, 'I have come to give you glad tidings; you shall perform Hajj%0D%0Aand return home safe and sound, and you shall also visit the grave of%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).'%0D%0A%0D%0AThe sheikh said, 'Who are you?' He replied, 'I am Khidhr.' The Shaykh said,%0D%0A'Pray for me.' Hadhrat Khidhr advised, 'Recite these words thrice, 'Yaa%0D%0Alateefan bi khalqihi. Yaa 'aleeman bikhaliqihi. Yaa khabeeran bikhalqihi.%0D%0AUltuf biy yaa lateef, yaa 'aleem yaa khabeer.' ()%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen the Shaykh heard this, he woke up and saw someone on a camel. Then he%0D%0Amade Hajj.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Shaykh says whenever he met any distress or difficulty, he recited the%0D%0ADu'aa taught by Hadhrat Khidhr (Alayhis salaam). It proved to be very%0D%0Abeneficial and for all this he is most grateful to Allah.
