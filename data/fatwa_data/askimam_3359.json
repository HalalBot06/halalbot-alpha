  "question": "I have heard that the reason for iddat is to see if any softness will come into the hearts of the husband and wife. Is this true?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAnd what if the wife is performing her iddat at her parents home? I have also heard that iddat should be performed at the husbands home.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In principle, a female in Iddat is still regarded as a wife in terms of\nmaintenance, shelter and not being able to marry another person. Therefore,\nshe must observe Iddat at her husband's residence.\n\n2. The laws of Iddat is a divine order which requires submission without\nquestioning its wisdom. However, if issuing a divorce to soften the wife is\nthe only alternative to achieve one's purpose of a happy matrimonial home,\nit may be considered. Another wisdom is to clear the womb from any possible\nconception.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
