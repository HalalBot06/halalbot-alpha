  "question": "Whose duty is it to support a widow's children?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a widow with 3 children. My son is studying at the Technikon, and both my daughters are still at school. I know it is not right for me to work, but I have no alternative but to do so. Please tell me whose responsibility is it to support the children. Is it the paternal grandparents or the mother's brothers. Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the family members of your late husband do not maintain your children,\nand you have no other source of income, you will be excused for seeking\nemployment to support yourself and your children.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
