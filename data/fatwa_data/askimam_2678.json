  "question": "Should I grow a beard when I have the right intention and know that i will be fully committed to keeping it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalamalaikum. I understand that keeping the beard is required, but sometimes it is very difficult to do so in the west. Sometimes i grow it, then shave it off and then grow it again and then shave it off...is what I'm doing more haram than not keeping a beard at all? Also, Should i decide not to keep a beard until i think im ready to make the commitment 100%? JazakAllah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has stated, 'A time is approaching when a%0D%0Apractiser upon my Sunnah will be like holding onto an ember.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is obvious that in such an environment due to the difficulty, one%0D%0Apractising upon the Sunnah will attain greater rewards. You should,%0D%0Atherefore, continue to try and be practical. The more one tries, the more%0D%0Ahope there is that he will gain the help of Allah Ta'ala. Therefore, we%0D%0Aadvise you to allow your beard to grow and continue making Du'aa to Allah Ta%0D%0A'ala to grant you Tawfeeq (ability) and Istiqaamah (steadfastness) to let it%0D%0Aremain. With constant Du'aas, Insha Allah, you will find the strength to%0D%0Apractise on this Sunnah of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Before%0D%0Ashaving off your beard, you should ponder on what you are about to do. If,%0D%0Adespite deliberation, you shave it off, you should make repentance (Tawbah)%0D%0Ato Allah and make a firm intention to keep it thereafter.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala grant you and ourselves the strength and ability to%0D%0Apractise on our beloved Deen of Islam.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
