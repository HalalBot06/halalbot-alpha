  "question": "Will men and women be allowed to be friends in Jannah? will we be able to be friends in Jannah if we are both good muslims and given our books in our right hands on the day of judgement?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a new revert man and the girl who helped me revert and is a dear friend has said she must cut off our friendship because she is marrying now and her fiance's family is quite strict. will we be able to be friends in Jannah if we are both good muslims and given our books in our right hands on the day of judgement? Insha'allah. I thought i had heard of a Haddith of a women asking the Prophet(pbuh) if could be friends in Jannah and he said yes. is this a haddith and what is it exactly if so?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is encouraging to note that you have accepted Islam. May Allah Ta?ala keep you steadfast, Aameen.\n\nThe girl who helped you to accept Islam has done you a great favour for which she will be immensely rewarded by Allah Ta?ala. In appreciation, you too should make Du?aa to Allah for her.\n\nIn Islam, friendship with the opposite gender in this world is confined to that only. The western concept of friendship with the opposite gender has no place in Islam. Regarding Jannah, it suffices to state that believers in Jannah will be united and fulfilled.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
