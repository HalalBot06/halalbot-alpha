  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have a question about working in a medical clinic in USA.As majority in USA has medical insurance.Whenever somebody visit the doctor he/she does not pay but insurance company pay on behalf of him/her to the doctor.Is it allowed to work in doctor?s office?Because there is no other choice here if someone wants to work in a medical field,as medical field has always a connection with insurance.And also does it mean that no muslim doctor can practice his work here in USA?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for a Muslim to practise medicine in USA. It is also permissible to work in a doctor?s office.\n\nThe doctor provides a valid service and charges a fee. The patients pay through medical aid insurance. That does not affect the Halaal status of the doctor?s income.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
