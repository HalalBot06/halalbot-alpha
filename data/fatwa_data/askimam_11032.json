Is this Talaaq valid because I knew they want to take her so I let her go Make Duaa Inshallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou mention that you said to your uncle that if you take her, then she will be divorced thrice. If that uncle took her, then she will be divorced, regardless of whether she knew of it or not and regardless of whether you knew they were going to take her or not.\n\nTalaaq is not a thing to play with and once uttered, the damage is done.\n\nYour wife is now haraam for you and you cannot remarry her, unless she happens to get married to someone else and he consummates the marriage and then divorces her.\n\nYou should inform her of the divorce, so that she can begin her iddat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
