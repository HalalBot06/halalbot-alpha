  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy brother has changed alot in past few years. Earlier he used to pray & listen to religious talks but now he dont pray & think that people pray to only show off. Infact alhamdulillah he does fasting but no salath. He wants to get maried soon but wont respond well to the girls relatives when some allaiance comes for him. Please tell some dua so that he can change & pls do pray for him. JazakaAllah for ur reply.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe wish to advise that reading Du?aas to solve such problems is not the solution. The solution is proper upbringing by the parents.\n\nGenerally, parents leave their children to do as they wish. Thereafter, they sit with big worries. Nevertheless, your parents should advise your brother with a lot of wisdom and kindness about Salaat, etc. Any attitude that will turn him away should not be used. Rather, you as a brother, should give him more attention and show him more love so that he may change.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
