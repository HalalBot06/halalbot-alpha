  "question": "Replying Azan...1. When there are Adzhans from more than one Mosque at the same time?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nOne should reply to Adzhan (prayer call). However, I little bit confused how to reply under certain condition as mentioned below: 1. When there are Adzhans from more than one Mosque at the same time? 2. When we know that there is Adzhan but we do not comprehend words exactly due to distance? 3. We are travelling and only hear part of Adzhan?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. While it would be best to reply to all the azaans, it is necessary to reply to the first one. (Shaami Vol.1 Pg.397-H.M.Saeed, Ahsanul Fatawa, Fatawa Rahimiyyah Vol.3 Pg.98-Jadeed, Tahtaawi alal maraqi Pg.236)\n\n2. One could approximate what the muazzin is saying and reply accordingly. If you cannot hear it at all, then there would be no need to reply.(Shaami Vol.1 Pg.396-H.M.Saeed)\n\n3. When one hears part of the azan, he should reply right from the beginning eg. he heard azan from hayya alas salah, he should say \"Allahu akbar \" 4 times, then the 2 thahadas, then \"Laahawlaa wa laa..\". (Shaami Vol.1 Pg.396-H.M.Saeed, Malfoozaat faqeehul ummah)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Husain Kadodia\nFATWA DEPT."
