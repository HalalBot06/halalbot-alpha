If so, under what%0D%0Acircumstances?%0D%0A%0D%0AAnswer%0D%0AContraception is permissible on a limited scale for valid reasons - reasons%0D%0Aconsidered by the Shari%E1h to be valid. The circumstances which will permit%0D%0Areversible and permanent contraception differ.%0D%0A%0D%0AREVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTION%0D%0AAmong the reasons accepted by the Shari%E1h as valid for practising reversible%0D%0Acontraception are:%0D%0A(A) Physical weakness.%0D%0A(B) Sickness.%0D%0A(C) The wife maintaining her beauty or figure for the sake of her husband.%0D%0A(D) The couple being on a journey or in a distant land.%0D%0A(E) Adverse political conditions, e.g. children are forcibly separated from%0D%0Atheir parents as is advocated by communism; etc.%0D%0A(F) The couple decide to separate in the near future.%0D%0A(G) The wife is an immoral person.%0D%0A%0D%0AThere are valid grounds for practising reversible contraception. Poverty or%0D%0Athe fear of poverty are not valid reasons for contraception.

If practised for any reason which is%0D%0Aunlawful in Islam, then contraception will likewise be unlawful, e.g. for%0D%0Aindulgence in illicit sex.%0D%0A%0D%0APERMANENT CONTRACEPTION%0D%0APermanent contraception is permissible only if the woman's life is in danger%0D%0Aor her health is seriously threatened.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
