  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know the story of a pious man who commited zina. He was from the sahabi or tabeen or tabe tbeen. There were 3 mujahid brothers who leaves their sister to him for her protection. First, the pious man was very shy and then he gradually gets attracted to her and then he commits zina. At the end, he makes sujood to shaytan and dies in that state. I have heard that story in one jumuah khutbah but don't know the complete story and the source. I will be happy if u can research little bit and provide me with the answers. Jazakallah khairun.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThis story can be found in many books of Tafseer like Jaami li Ahkaamil Qur’aan of Allamah Qurtubi, Durrul Manthoor of Jalaaluddin Suyuti in Surah Hashr, Aayat16.\n\nThere are many narrations regarding this story. The name of the great worshipper was ‘Barseesa’. He was from amongst the Banu Israaeel. After having made Zina with her, it was soon that she had become pregnant. He was afraid that upon the return of her brothers, his sin would be publicised amongst the people and his dignity and respect would be lost. Shaytaan had insighted him to kill this girl and it was not long when this pious man had killed the girl. When her brothers had returned, he informed them that their sister has passed away fue to sickness. They were shown in a vision that in actual fact it was the pious man who had killed her and buried her under a certain tree. The brother got hold of this pious man to avenge the death of their sister and it was again at this crucial moment that Shaytaan came to him and said, ‘If you obey me one more time, I will save you.’\n\nShaytaan told the man to prostrate before him. The pious man prostrated before Shaytaan and Shaytaan had deserted him. Eventually, he was killed. Therefore, this story can be intended under the Aayat in Surah Hashr which states, ‘like the example of Shaytaan when he says to man ‘commit kufr’. But when he commit kufr, Shaytaan says, ‘I have dothing to do with you.’\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
