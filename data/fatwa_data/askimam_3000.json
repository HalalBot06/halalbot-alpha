  "question": "What madzhabs did imaam Muslim, Abu Dawud, Trimizi, Bukhari,and Ibn Majah follow?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. According to Hafiz ibn Hajar (RA), Imaam Bukhari was a Shaaf'ee. Ibn\nal-Qayyim is of the opinion that he was a Hanbali. The preferred view seems\nto be that he was a Mujtahid (one qualified to make independent deductions\nfrom the sources of Islamic law). (Zafarul Muhassireen pg.108; Mir Muhammad)\n2. The author of Zafarul Muhassileen has stated that the Madhab of these\nAimmah (plural of Imaam) Muslim (RA), Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah (RA) is not\nknown. However, research of their works have shown them to be inclined to\nthe Madhab of the people of Hijaaz. It is most likely that they were\nMujtahids in their own right. (Ibid pg.140; 118)\n3. Allaamah Anwar Shah Kashmiri (RA) with reference to Ibn Taymiyah has\nregarded Imaam Abu Dawud among the Jurists of Hanbaliy Madhab. Research of\nhis work attests to this. (Ibid pg.126)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
