  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)  I am asking this question on behalf of my friend. Its regarding the matter of zina. He is a muslim and had a muslim girlfirend.\nThey used to have oral sex and but not sexual intercourse. Now the two have broken up as the girl prayed istikhara upon the boy and she saw a dream of her parents not wanting her to marry from outside the community as the boy is not from her community.\nBoth the parties have realised their mistakes and are repenting to Allah (s.w). \nThe guy really loves the girl wants to get married to her. But the girl is reluctant since her parents wont agree the guy because he is from a different community.The question is should the boy take a proposal for the girl to get married to her and if by Gods will the parents agree, will that marriage be right? would they live happy life? is der any verse for the Holy Quran or Hadith that say when these two people get married will not live a happy life? and  if there is anything you can provide regarding the parents not agree for the marriage since he from a different community.\n\n2)  I stay with my brother and sister in law. if they do not pray and not do things according to sharia is it ok to tell my parents about their behaviuor and ask them(my parents) to talk to them or will i be FITNA as i cannot confess my brother directly as he is elder than me???\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n1. If your friend has decided that he would like to marry this girl, then he should pray salāt al-istikhārah and seek the help of Allāh Ta’ālā.  Thereafter, he should propose to the girl’s family.  If they agree, then you may proceed with the marriage and continue to make du’ā to Allāh Ta’ālā to put blessings in it.  However, if they reject the proposal, then he should be content that this was the best outcome and Allāh Ta’ālā prevented him from some harm in the future.\n\n \n\nAs for the girl’s family, they should not reject the proposal solely based on him being from a different community.  Allāh Ta’ālā says,\n\n \n\nيَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ مِنْ ذَكَرٍ وَأُنْثَى وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ شُعُوبًا وَقَبَائِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوا إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ أَتْقَاكُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ خَبِيرٌ (الحجرات: 13)\n\nO Mankind!  We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes that you may know one another.  Verily, the most honorable of you with Allāh is he who has the most taqwā (God-consciousness).  Verily, Allāh is All-Knowing, All-Wise (Qur’ān 49:13)\n\n \n\n2. With the intention of getting your brother and sister-in-law to follow the laws of the Sharī’ah, you may seek the assistance of someone who you believe could convince them, such as an elder family member or the local imām.  However, you may not disclose their shortcomings to anyone else who is not actively helping your brother and sister-in-law in this matter.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
