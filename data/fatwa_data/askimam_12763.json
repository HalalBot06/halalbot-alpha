  "answer": "QUESTION\nYour reply was comprehensive and logical Alhamdulillah. I want two more clarifications for myself. 1. If the bait is not made , will the person be committing a sin. 2. If the bait is made and the person to whom the bait is made, he stops from going with Jammat by giving reasons like, first you learn yourself and be able to go and preach other etc. Then what are orders of Shariah for the person who has made bait.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If a person does not take bay?at, he will not be sinful.\n\n2. The Shaykh will offer advise to his follower (mureed) that is in the best interest of the mureed. The mureed should understand that and follow the guidance.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
