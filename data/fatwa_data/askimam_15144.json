  "question": "Dua for Sultanul Aadil in the khutbah of Jumuah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhy do some Ulama STILL make dua for Sultanul-Adil (Just Muslim King) in the 2nd part of Jummah Khutbah? Ignore Haramain (Makki & Madani) in this query because that is just government ruled Khutbah (through & through)!\n\nAre Ulama in UK & elsewhere simply reading Khutbahs written over 100 years ago (parrot fashion) without realising it and don't want to change it; or is there is a reason for doing it in UK?\n\nI understand that this will not have an impact on the validity of the Khutbah or Jummuah; but shouldn't this practise be discontinued?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh.\n\nTo make dua for Sultanul Aadil in the khutbah of Jumuah is Mabah (permissible) according to Shariah; and the ruling for something permissible is that if it regarded as compulsory, then one should refrain from it.\n\nSimilarly, if the people regard making dua for Sultanul Aadil as compulsory, then the Ulama should refrain from it.\n\nMoreover, the essence of a khutbah is to educate the public on Islamic matters; and this is lost when the khutbas are rendered in parrot fashion.\n\nHowever, it is not a matter of Halaal and Haram and should not be the cause of dispute amongst the scholars, but should rather be dealt with a lot of wisdom. Moreover, if it is a cause of disarray amongst the Muslim Ummah, then one should not refer to such matters in public.\n\nKifayatul Mufti Vol:4 Pgs: 213 and 233-236 Maktabah Haqqaniyah\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nM.
