  "question": "What is the correct procedure of Sajda Tilawat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI need to know what is the correct  way of offering sajda-i-tilawat  when it comes during the qiyam. Are we supposed to wait and offer it after the completion of Salah or @ real time during the salah. In case of later one how we will offer it if it comes at the end of qiyam like Surah - Najm. Further waht is differnce between Tawfeeq & Irshad?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1) If a person recites a sajda verse in salah he should make the sajda in salah. It is best for him to immediately go in prostration and thereafter come back up in the standing position. If a person recites a verse of sajda and thereafter immediately goes into ruku this would also suffice on condition that he has intention for the sajda to be included with his ruku. However, if a person recites more than three verses after the sajda verse then ruku would not suffice. If person went into sajda then upon standing up it is preferred that he recites two or three verses before going into ruku. If the verse of sajda is the last verse of the sura, as in Sura Najm, one should start another sura and then go into ruku. It is a sin to leave out the sajda, however, there is no compensation for it after the salah but it would be necessary to make istighfar.\n\n قوله: (وتؤدي بركوع وسجود) الواو بمعنى أو.\n\nقال في الحلية: والاصل في أدائها السجود وهو أفضل، ولو ركع لها على الفور جاز، وإلالا ا ه: أي وإن فات الفور ولا يصح أن يركع لها ولو في حرمة الصلاة.\n\nثم إذا سجد أو ركع لها على حدة فورا يعود إلى القيام، ويستحب أن لا يعقبه بالركوع بل يقرأ آيتين أو ثلاثا فصاعدا ثم يركع ا ه.\n\nقوله: (وإذا لم يسجد أثم الخ) أفاد أنه لا يقضيها.\n\nحاشية ابن عابدين 2/1-110 سعيد\n\n2) Tawfeeq refers to the ability given by Allah Ta'ala to carry out any good deed whereas irshad means to guide or point out to what is good.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMl.
