  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaikum I @ times have sex chat/phone sex with a friend . Is it considered a form of adultery/fornication even though i DONT touch myself or get excited . Your response is appreciated .\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the understanding of one Hadith, the two eyes commit adultery, and the adultery of the eyes is to look at a Ghayr Mahram (not prohibited in marriage) women with lust. The two hands commit adultery and that is to touch a Ghayr Mahram woman. The two feet commit adultery and that is walking towards a Ghayr Mahram woman. The two ears commit adultery and that is hearing and deriving enjoyment from the voice of a Ghayr Mahram.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn principle, every means of adultery is regarded as adultery itself. Allah Ta?ala says in the noble Qur?aan, ?And do not get close to adultery.? The reason for not getting close to adultery is clear.%0D%0A%0D%0AThat will tempt the individual to go even further and finally he%2Fshe will commit adultery. Which human being can trust his soul especially when the soul is always in the close watch of the Shaytaan. Sex chat and phone sex is clearly adultery and a major sin. It is also death to one?s spirituality. Many people have also become addicts to this evil and find themselves trapped in the permanent net of the Shaytaan.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
