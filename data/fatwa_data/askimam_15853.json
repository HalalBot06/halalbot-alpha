  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1)  Is it permitable to watch a adult  movie together to to bring more excitement in our life.\n2) These day in medical store we get  some tablets, which can instead inside vegina before having sex, these tablets than wont let women    become pragnenet. is allowed to use such tablets? for  family planning ( forfew months) is it harmful for women's health?\n\n\n3) We heard that one week before and  one week after period women's body  create spurms, if we have sex during that period , is it guarnteed  that we will not have baby\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1. It is haram to watch adult movies. Shariah emphasizes on shame and modesty. Rasulullah (SAW) said, “Shame is an integral branch of Ieman”. Adult movies have immoral and evil contents in them. This is against shame and modesty. Furthermore, the excitement creates through watching these movies leads a person to think and feel evil. It leads a person to fulfill his passion in the immoral way as in the movies. The issue becomes worse if the person is not married. It will lead him to committing zina or other evil and immoral acts like masturbation etc.\n\nThe excitement created in one through watching such movies creates a want and demand within a person to watch more. That leads him to be an addict to watching such movies. In many instances, married people are more inclined to such movies in fulfilling their passions and desires which results in marital breakdown. The spiritual harms of watching such movies are too many to enumerate. Such a person’s heart and mind filled with evil pictures and positions derives enjoyment through that. How does one expect to then enjoy the spirituality of salah, zikr and tilawat of the Quran?\n\nIf one is involved in this evil habit, he should fear Allah and have the courage to abandon the bad habit. Remove all those things around him that leads him to see such movies. Remove the computer, TV, magazines, DVDs etc. There will be withdrawal symptoms in doing but one will have to go through that to kick the bad and evil habits.\n\n2. S/A Birth Control\n\n3. We answer only Shari related queries. This is not a Shari question. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa\n\nCONTRACEPTION\n\nReversible\n\nChemical - the pill which is taken orally spermicidal jellies used locally. Mechanical - use of condom intra-uterine device Physical - coitus interruptus rhythm method Permanent - sterilization operation - tubal ligations - vasectomies.\n\nQuestion 1\n\nIs the Practice of contraception allowed in Islam? If so, under what circumstances?\n\nAnswer\n\nContraception is permissible on a limited scale for valid reasons - reasons considered by the Shariلh to be valid. The circumstances which will permit reversible and permanent contraception differ.\n\nREVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTION\n\nAmong the reasons accepted by the Shariلh as valid for practising reversible contraception are:\n\n(A) Physical weakness.\n(B) Sickness.\n(C) The wife maintaining her beauty or figure for the sake of her husband.\n(D) The couple being on a journey or in a distant land.\n(E) Adverse political conditions, e.g. children are forcibly separated from their parents as is advocated by communism; etc.\n(F) The couple decide to separate in the near future.\n(G) The wife is an immoral person.\n\nThere are valid grounds for practising reversible contraception. Poverty or the fear of poverty are not valid reasons for contraception. It is not permissible to practice contraception on account of a fear of not being able to provide for a large family. Such a fear is an attribute of non-Muslims. According to the Qurمn Shareef: 'There is not a living creature, but its sustenance is the responsibility of Allah.'\n\nSimilarly desire to curb sexual desire which may stem out of piety is not a lawful ground for contraception. If practised for any reason which is unlawful in Islam, then contraception will likewise be unlawful, e.g. for indulgence in illicit sex.\n\nPERMANENT CONTRACEPTION\n\nPermanent contraception is permissible only if the woman's life is in danger or her health is seriously threatened.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
