  "question": "There are children out there whose parents, for example, are dealing in riba and who are fed with meat attained through this money. What should the children do in this case?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIt is mentioned that if someone eats food that is earned through haraam, it will be detrimental to the salvation of that individual in the Hereafter.\n \nDoes this apply to one who eats halaal meat gained through haraam money?\n \nThere are children out there whose parents, for example, are dealing in riba and who are fed with meat attained through this money. What should the children do in this case?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhatever is Halaal cannot be declared Haraam and whatever is Haram cannot be declared Halal. Therefore, Halaal meat bought with Haraam (impure) money is also Haraam.\n\n \n\n \n\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ‘A person who was nourished with Haraam will not enter Jannah.’ Secondly, in the case of the children, the parents are responsible to sustain them with Halal and pure earnings. Children will not be responsible.\n\n \n\n \n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
