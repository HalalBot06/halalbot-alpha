  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSalaam Alakium,\n\nI have a question about my children. When a child is on punishment (like grounded for getting in trouble at school for bad behaviour or for bad behaviour at home), should the child be allowed to have extra things like dessert, candy, or treats?\n\nThank you kindy for your help.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nIt is compulsory upon parents to discipline their children and raise them with good habits. There is no specific method of disciplining children for bad behavior and conduct. Whatever reasonable method proves effective may be adopted.\n\nTo deprive children of the luxuries referred to in your email to discipline them is reasonable. Apart from adopting these measures, make d῾uā’for the good conduct and piety of one’s children is very effective. The parent’s du῾ā’sfor one’s children are accepted.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
