  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nif a divorce occurs and the husband tries to give the Haq mehr to his ex-wife but the wife and her family refuse to take the Haq Mehr, would the Husband be sinful in this case? What should the husband do in this case so that in the day of Judgement, he is not held responsible for not paying the Haq Mehr.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to the Shariâ€™ah, Mahr remains a debt on the husband until he pays it. However, if the wife forfeits her rights in the debt, the husband will no longer be responsible. The same will apply if the couple is married or divorced. The ex-wife will be rewarded for absolving the ex-husband of his debt.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
