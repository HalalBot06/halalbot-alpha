  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow Should I Pay ZAKATH I earn RS. 38,000 a month as a monthly salary from my job. After fulfilling my basic needs and spending for my sister?s family needs (because her husband has left her with 2 children), I save a few rupees every month . My question is; I must pay Zakath on my monthly salary OR on the amount I save every month?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nZakaat is calculated from the excess wealth, i.e. after the needs of your family have been discharged. So, in your case, the Zakaat should be calculated yearly by deducting 2.5% of your excess wealth.\n\nZakaat should be calculated on the amounts saved every month. If those add up to the Nisaab of Zakaat at the end of the year, then the Zakaat should be paid by deducting 2.5% of the wealth.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
