  "answer": "QUESTION\nKindly let me know whether hair transplantation for baldness is allowed or not. The procedure involves transplanting hair from back of the head to the balded area. JazakAllah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHadhrat Abdullah ibn Mas'ood (Radhiallaahu Anhu) said, 'Allah Ta'ala curses\nthose ladies who practise tattooing, those who have themselves tattooed,\nthose ladies who remove the hair from their faces and those who make\nartificial spaces between their teeth in order to look more beautiful\nwhereby they change Allah's creation.' (Bukhari).\n\nIn view of the abovementioned Hadith, it is also not permissible for you to\ntransplant hair for beautification purposes as that is also changing one's\nnatural appearance.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
