  "question": "haraam products - I use Nurpur Butter and Cheese which is manufactured in Pakistan. Am I allowed to eat these?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI read in an article about haraam things that as 'Renet' is used in all the cheeses, it is prohibited to use cheese. I use Nurpur Butter and Cheese which is manufactured in Pakistan. Am I allowed to eat these? Apart from that some people say that as 'pepsin' is used in Pepsi and other cola bottles, it is haraam to drink them. Pepsin, they say is made from young pig blood. Is this true? Also, is pig fat used in lipsticks? Please help. Jazakallah!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe are based in South Africa.\n\nWe advise you consult your local Ulama or any reliable Halaal organization\nin Pakistan to advise you on local Halaal/Haraam products.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
