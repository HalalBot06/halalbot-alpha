  "question": "It is permissible to use alcohol which is not derived from grapes or dates with the following conditions",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease can you verify whether alcohol can be consumed? because as I understand it Alcohol is haraam but yet in March you responded to a question by saying the following and I quote \"\n\n1.   It is permissible to use alcohol which is not derived from grapes or dates with the following conditions:\n\na.    It is not used as an intoxicant or to an amount which intoxicates\n\nb.    It is not used in vain\n\n2.  The permissibility and impermissibility will differ from person to person as each person’s level to bear the alcohol without getting intoxicated differs.  One should avoid using excessive amounts of Alcohol in cooking if there is a doubt of it intoxicating.  If there are alternatives available, then they should be adopted to avoid the chances of alcohol leading to intoxication.\n\nSo now this is really confusing, does this mean that we are actually allowed to consume alcohol just not to the point of intoxication. please can you clarify this. because i have always been taught that alcohol is haraam and if you consume alcohol you cannot read quraan or your salaah for 40 days. So I would really appreciate some clarity on this.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAs stated in our previous fatwa, alcohol which is derived from grapes and dates cannot be consumed. A single drop of it will be unlawful for consumption and considered impure.\n\nAlcohol made from other sources other than dates and grapes are permissible ONLY with the following conditions.\n\nIt is not used as an intoxicant or to an amount which intoxicates\nIt is not used in vain.\n\nAlcoholic beverages fall in the category of vain, thus will not be lawful to consume. A small amount from it will also be unlawful and the person drinking it will be committing a sinful act.\n\nProducts which contain alcohol as an ingredient for intoxication will fall in the same ruling as alcoholic beverages.\n\nThose products which have the capability to intoxicate will also be unlawful, even if a small amount of consumption does not intoxicate the consumer.\n\nIf the alcohol is derived from a source other than grapes and dates and it is not used in vain or as an intoxicant such as the alcohol found in medicines and perfumes, then it will not be unlawful or impure. One may recite the Qur’an and perform salat after using such products. We hope the above clarifies the issue.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl.
