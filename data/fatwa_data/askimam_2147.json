  "question": "Is it allowed to eat sweets which are purchased from shops which are run by Hindus.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nShop which are Run by Hindus do not contain any items which are non-veg. So is it allowed to purchase sweets from them, if they are of better quality and price.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf one is certain that the confectionery, sweets, etc. as well as the\nutensils used in their preparation are pure, then it will be permissible to\nconsume them. If one has no knowledge whether the sweets and the untensils\nare pure or not, then it will be Makrooh (reprehensible) to consume such\nconfectionery and sweets. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyah vol.8 pg.262; Maktaba\nMahmoodiyya)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
