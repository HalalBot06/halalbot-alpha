  "question": "Is is part of the PURE and original usool of Moulana Ilyaas that the Tabligh Jamaat's activities are only concerned with amr-bil-ma'roof and not nahi-anil-munkar ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Saheb, Muslims are supposed to be doing amr-bil-ma'roof and nahi-anil-munkar as part of our duty. We have forgotten this responsibility. Moulana Iyaas was inspired to revive deen and hence he started the tabligh movement. It is difficult in todays time to go around pointing out the ummats evil what with our sorry and weak state. Hence, I've heard that it was part of his original usool of the jamaat that they only do amr-bil-ma'roof and not nahi-anil-munkar. Is it actually part of the pure original ussool in the writings of Hazrat Moulana Ilyaas saheb (R.A.)or not ? Jazaakallah-fid-darain.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe desire of Hadhrat Moulana Ilyaas Saheb (RA) was to revive the pure Deen%0D%0Aof Allah Ta'ala. For this, he had laid down certain principles (Usools)%0D%0Awhich were based on Qur'aan and Hadith. In order to achieve this, he%0D%0Aconstantly reminded the people about the responsibility of Amr bil Ma'roof%0D%0Aand Nahy anil munkar.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe actual problem today is that we have misinterpreted the real meaning of%0D%0ANahy anil munkar. Nahy anil munkar does not refer to being hard, rough,%0D%0Apower, strength, weapons and the likes thereof. A simple example will show%0D%0Aus exactly what is Nahy anil munkar. A villager during the time of Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) entered Musjid-un-nabawiy and began urinating%0D%0Ain one corner of the Musjid. Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) immediately wanted%0D%0Ato take action but were prevented by Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) let the villager relieve himself%0D%0Acomfortably and thereafter called him aside and with love, compassion and%0D%0Akindness made him understand that this is the house of Allah which is clean%0D%0Aand pure, etc. Look at the level of the evil that this villager had caused.%0D%0AUrinating in front of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) inside%0D%0AMusjid-un-Nabawiy. Yet, look at how Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Acarried out the duty of Nahy anil munkar.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis is exactly what was the desire of Moulana Ilyas Saheb (RA). In doing%0D%0AAmr bil Ma'roof as done by the brothers of the Tablighi Jamaat, they%0D%0Aencourage us to spend time in the path of Allah Ta'ala, so that once we are%0D%0Ain a pure environment, the Musjid, we will automatically realize the%0D%0Aimportance of making an effort for Deen and understand the harms of leading%0D%0Aa life full of disobedience.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
