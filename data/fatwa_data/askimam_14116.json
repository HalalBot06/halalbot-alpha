  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nYou recently discussed financing college education by having someone purchase books for the student.  Please elaborate on how this works.  Keep in mind that tuition for a professional college often costs tens of thousands of dollars per year while books will only cost a few hundred dollars per year.  Also, these are usually two separate costs since the books are usually purchased from a separate bookstore.  Please inform us of some Islamically acceptable method for financing college education whereby the financer can seek to profit from financing the education.  People are generally not willing to simply give an interest free loan of $200,000 which is often the total cost for a person to attend a professional school.  Also, education is extremely important if Muslims wish to not only empower themselves, but even to just earn a halal income.  If you look at the jobs that non-educated Muslims are engaged in, many of them include assisting their employers in selling haram goods.  And often times they don't have a choice since many stores will have at least some percentage of their goods being haram.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe will gladly assist in devising a Shari’ah compliant method of financing education. In order to do that, we require a detailed explanation of the education costs, books, tuition, etc. You or anyone from the United States could call me at 031-7851239 / 084 2998390 to discuss the issue.\n\nSouth Africa is approximately 7 to 9 hours ahead in time than United States. 8am to 11am United States time is suitable.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
