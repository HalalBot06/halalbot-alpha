  "question": "have quite often seen people covering all the mirrors in their houses if there is a janaazah in the house",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalaamu alakum.\n\nI have quite often seen people covering all the mirrors in their houses if there is a janaazah in the house. The explanation i got from my elders is that \"The malaaika dont like seeing their own reflection so they wont enter your house if you dont cover the mirrors.\" I dont believe this, but would like to know if there is any islamic basis for doing this or if it is just an indian culture / 'old wives tale?' as some people cover it for the entire 40 day period (which another issue I am unsure about regarding its islamic basis).\n\nShukran, Wassalaamu alaykum\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nThere is no basis in Shariah for covering the mirrors during janazah or for 40 days. \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
