  "question": "Are we allowed to examine female patients?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamu Aleikum, We are medical students in the West and are starting to see patients as part of our training. Are we allowed to examine female patients? Please bear in mind the following : We will try our utmost to respect the dignity of the patient and expose the minimum possible. We will never be alone in a room with a female patient. We have 3 major clinical exams before we can qualify as doctors and If in an exam we are asked to examine a female, not having practiced may put us at a disadvantage. Also, in the future if we are faced with an emergency where we need to examine a female patient, not having the experience may leave us in a poorer position to diagnose the problem / treat the patient/ save their life. Jazakumullahu Khairal-Jazaa' for your humble efforts.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, it is permissible for a doctor to treat a patient of the opposite gender. It is obvious, he/she has to qualify for that. It is, therefore, permissible for you to examine female patients as part of your training and qualifying process.\n\nThe Fuqahaa have advised that it is preferable for a patient to consult a doctor of the same gender.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
