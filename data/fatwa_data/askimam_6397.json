  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like to goto Jihad in Palestine to free MAshid Al-Aqsa, without my mothers permission is allowed?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is the wish and desire of every Muslim for Musjidul Aqsa to be freed from\nZionist rule and oppression.\n\nThe Palestinian people are making every possible effort to do that but are\nfaced with many obstacles. From the apparent situation there, it is unlikely\nthat your physical presence there may make any signification difference. We,\ntherefore, advise you assist in any other way. Most importantly, make Du'aa\nfor the liberation of the victims of oppression.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
