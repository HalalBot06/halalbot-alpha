  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs alamualikum. I am working in a buying house. Based on the price of accessories we quoted a rate for a item to the buyer but once the the buyer placed the order the price of accessories decreased little bit. Now my company is enjoining the profit due to the decreasing of the accessories price. Supplier also offering me individually a portion from this profit or the money which occurring from the accessories price discount. Pls let me know whether this money will be halal or haram for me.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIf your company has quoted a customer an inflated price for certain goods/accessories, thereafter the cost of the items decrease, it will be permissible for your company to sell the items to the customer at the price initially agreed upon without disclosing the fact that they have received the goods/accessories for cheaper. The profit acquired will be Halaal.\n\nIn order for us to comment on the money receivable from the supplier, kindly clarify in what context are they offering you a portion of the profit they making?\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\nMl.
