  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam u alaikum Can you tell me something about jinns. When I work midnight shift, I hear noises and whistles. Do they harm you in anyway? Do they do physical harm to humans because humans can't see them? kindly explain in details\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJinns are also like human beings, obedient and disobedient.\n\nIt is possible that the disobedient Jinns cause harm to human beings. In\norder to protect oneself from the mischief and harms of Jinns one should\nstay in the state of Wudhu, perform all the Salaat, recite Aayaatul Kursi\nafter every Salaat and the four Quls before sleeping.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
