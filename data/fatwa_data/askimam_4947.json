  "question": "scientific discoveries and about prophets",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nsalams mufti desai, here are some questions i need some help on: 1) there are nowadays in the light of modern science many things that are contained in the quran which can be explained by modern science. Is it safe to interpret some ayats of quran in the light of new scientific discoveries or must a person stick to the 'classical interpretations' , one example is the ayah in surah zariyat which ends in ' la moosi'oon' , the classical interpretion of the ayah is that moosi'oon is connected with allahs power, but the interpretion in the light of modern science is that 'we are expanding the universe' referring to astrophysical calculations that the universe is expanding. what is your view? 2) i am very interested in knowing where some of the prophets are buried eg hazrat yusuf , ibrahim , isma'il , yunus , yahya (a.s)? , where can one find reliable information about their places of burial? could you please provide the places of burials for as many of the prophets in the quran as possible? 3) what was the language of hazrat adam (a.s)?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Before discussing the answer, it is important to differentiate between%0D%0Ascientific fact and scientific theory.Since scientific theory is susceptible%0D%0Ato change, it would be incorrect to interpret any Aayah of the Quran, which%0D%0Ais Muhkam (absolute), in the light of something indefinite and non concrete.%0D%0ARegarding concrete scientific fact, if interpretation in the light of these%0D%0Ais endorsed and has the approval of reliable Ulama who fulfill the%0D%0Acriterion of a Mufassir (excegete)as required by the Usool (Principles) of%0D%0ATafseer (excegis) , then such interpretation is acceptable.%0D%0A2. We are not aware of any works listing the burial places of Anbiyaa%0D%0A(Alayhis salaam) in the contemporary context. Reliable works on Taareekh%0D%0A(Islamic History) such as Al Bidaayah Wan Nihaayah of Imam Ibn Katheer(R.A)%0D%0Amay provide valuble information. Regrettably, due to lack of resources, we%0D%0Ado not have detailed compilations of Taareekh in our posession so are unable%0D%0Ato comply with your request.%0D%0A3. Commentating on Ayah no.31 of Suratul Baqarah(And We taught him(Adam) all%0D%0Athe Asmaa'...), Allaamah Aaloosi (R.A) has has narrated, among other views,%0D%0Aa view of Ibn Abbaas (R.A) that 'Asmaa'' in the Aayah means Languages i.e%0D%0Aall languages. (Roohul Ma'aani Vol 1 Pg 355 Haqqaaniyya).Furthermore, during%0D%0Ahis residence in Jannah, it is safe to conclude that he spoke Arabic, since%0D%0Athe language of Jannah is Arabic.Allaamah Ibn Katheer has related a%0D%0Astatement of Imaam Sufyaan As Sauri to the effect that all Wahy (revelation)%0D%0Awas in the Arabic language and that the language of Jannah is Arabic.%0D%0A(Tafseer Ibn Katheer Vol3 Pg 463 Darus Salaam)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Bilaal Cassim%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
