  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy moms been offered a job. Its a halaal food stall at an entertainment center, where movies are shown, concerts held and music played. She does not have to go there if she doesn't want to, just supply the food. It pays well, but will this income be halaal? Will the food encourage Muslims to frequent this place? Can we sell food to another person, who in turn can supply the center? We don't know what to do.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe food being supplied by your mother is Halaal and in order. However, it will be discouraged to supply at such a place.\n\nAnd Allah Ta?ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
