  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf we yawn does this invalidate our wudoo. Also, if we yawn whilst performing salaat, does this invalidate our salaat and do we have to repeat it after doing fresh wudoo. I heard the when we yawn shataan is laughing at us or he is doing urine in our mouth. Please explain why yawning is a sinn in Islam. Thank you.  \nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Yawning does not invalidate a person’s Wudhu nor does it invalidate the Salaat.\n\n2. It is narrated on the authority of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri [radhiallaahu anhu] that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘When anyone of you yawns, he should place his hand over his mouth, for verily if you do not do so Shaytaan enters your mouth.’ (Muslim Hadith7416). In another Hadith narrated on the authority of Abu Hurayra [radhiallaahu anhu] that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Yawning is from Saytaan. When one of you yawns, he should cover his mouth with his hand as Shaytaan laughs at a person when he yawns.’ (Bukhari vol.8 pg.50).\n\n3. We are unable to locate a Hadith wherein it is mentioned that Shaytaan urinates in a person’s mouth when he yawns.\n\n4. Yawning is not a sin in Islam. However, it is something disliked in Islam as it is an indication of laziness and being unhealthy. (Minhaaj part18 pg.322)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
