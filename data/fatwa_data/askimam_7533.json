  "question": "is eloping allowed in islam so as long as both guy and girl are ready? what are the restrictions of eloping if any?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\ndoes the girl need a guardian? both guy and girl feel they are ready to get married at the point and time. Can they elope or get nikkah without girls parents/guardians consent?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe concept of boy and girl eloping before marriage has no basis in Islam and is not permissible.\n\nIt is a grave sin and against the teachings of Shari?ah. It is also necessary for the girl to gain consent from her parents to get married. There is great blessings and goodness in this. Our beloved Master, Nabi Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) had given his daughter Faatima (Radhiallaahu Anha) over in marriage to Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
