You should not be overpowered by your emotions. Your parents will never desire evil and harm for you. Perhaps their vision of life is different and feel you will excel in a certain field. Their decision may be based on external factors which are unknown to you. Take up the courage to have an open discussion with your parents. Explain to them the revolution that has taken place within you, the reasons why you oppose studying in the university and your inclination towards studying the knowledge of Deen. In this manner, you will have a better understanding why they are opposed to you studying Deen and they will also realise your determination to study Deen.\n\nIf the university is as evil as you have described and you fear your Imān being at stake if you attend such a university, then placing your life and Imān before you, you should not attend such a university.\n\nRasulullah (sallallāhu alaihi wasallam) has mentioned:\n\n“There is no obedience for any creation (which entails) in the disobedience of the creator i.e. Allah”\n\n(Al-Mu’jamul Kabīr)[1]\n\nIt is not obligatory upon every individual to study and become an Alim. However, it is obligatory upon every individual to acquire that amount of knowledge which will grant him the ability to differentiate between Halāl and Harām and to practise on the injunctions of Deen. In the same light, it is also not obligatory to pursue a circular degree.\n\nAfter discussing the issue with your parents, if they insist that you should pursue a circular degree, in order to keep them happy and to fulfil your wonderful dream of becoming an Alim, suggest to study the Alim course which you are happy with and continue your circular studies via correspondence.\n\nPlease Allah and also keep your parents happy, Allah will grant you Barakah (blessings) in all that you do, Ameen.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n\n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftāa\n\n\n\n\n[1] عن عمران بن حصين قال : قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم  لا طاعة لمخلوق في معصية الخالق"
