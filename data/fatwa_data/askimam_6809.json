  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am trying to make up my qada fasts of ramadaan of the past years. I also suffer from Urinary bladder infection. I have to drink lot of water. Sometimes due to being busy or not rmembering to drink I feel a bit burning on the urinary part. Normally I make the intention of fasting at night, sometimes when I wake up in the morning I feel that I wouldn't be able to fast because of my problem. So, then I change my mind and drink something. When I was fasting that time the sun was setting between 21:30-22:00 and the fajr was at 1:41am. I want to know whether this was a sin and whether I have to make a kuffaraa of this.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSince you had a valid excuse for breaking your fast, you would not be sinful and Kaffaarah also would not apply.\n\nMere Qadhaa will suffice.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
