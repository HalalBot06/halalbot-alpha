  "question": "I have a female relative who openly admits that she commited adultery, is it acceptable for me to cut ties with her?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nshe is currently going through a divorce and might need emotional and financial assistance, am i obligated to help her?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA Muslim should not expose his/her sins. The sins should be concealed and one should seek repentance from Allah for the sins.\n\nIt is a sin to expose one?s sins. You should apply wisdom and diplomacy in communicating this to your relative. Show love and care and win her confidence in order for her to accept your advice. You may also do that by rendering her the financial and moral support she requires.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
