  "question": "1. Is it permitted for a woman with severe eczema to travel to the dead sea",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nassalamu alaykum wr wb. 1. Is it permitted for a woman with severe eczema to travel to the dead sea (Jordan) for treatment there as she has read that the natural minerals and water are a good cure? Someone told her that maybe she can't go because the area is the place where the people of Lut were destroyed and one cannot go there. 2. Please could you tell me how one should purify clothes which the wet part of a dog touches. Is it the same as washing dishes i.e. 7 times one of which is with soil or can you put them in the washing machine with other clothes? If one put them in the washing machine in the past does that mean they are still impure as well as the clothes they came into contact with? Jazak Allah Khir. ws wr wb.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] was returning from Tabuk to%0D%0AMadinah Munawwarah, he passed Hijr (the ruins of the nation of Thamud).%0D%0ARasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, 'Do not enter the houses of%0D%0Athose who have oppressed themselves but in the state of crying, perchance%0D%0Ayou will be afflicted with what they have been afflicted with (the%0D%0Apunishment of Allah).' Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] then covered%0D%0Ahis head and passed the valley as quick as possible. (Bukhari vol.2 pg.637;%0D%0AQadeemi)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Muhadditheen have stated that it is not advisable to go to places which%0D%0Awere afflicted with the punishment of Allah. If there is a need, then one%0D%0Awill be excused. (Hashiya Bukhari; Ibid).%0D%0A%0D%0AA person suffering from eczema may treat him%2Fherself through the dead sea if%0D%0Athere is no other form of cure. Going to the dead sea will be due to need%0D%0Aand necessity and not form mere tourism and entertainment.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe saliva of a dog is Najis (impure). The area of the clothing soiled with%0D%0Athe saliva of a dog must be washed. If the area is not known, the entire%0D%0Agarment must be washed. It will suffice to wash the garment in a domestic%0D%0Awashing machine with other clothing.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
