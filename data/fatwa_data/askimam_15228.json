He will not be regarded a Muslim even though he claims to be one.\n\nJawahirul Fiqh Vol:1 Pg:23 (Maktabah Darul Uloom Karachi)\n\nSecondly, although the Shias claim that they are Muslims, most of them have beliefs that negate the clear cut principles of Islam. Some of these beliefs are listed below:\n\n1.      They regard the Quran to be incomplete, and say that most of the Quran has been changed.\n\n2.      They regard most of the senior Sahabah (Radiyallahu Anhum), including the first three Khalifas, as murtads (those who have left the fold of Islam).\n\n3.      They regard the status of their twelve Imams to be higher than the status of the Ambiya (Alaihim Assalaatu Wassalaam).\n\nAaapke Masaail aur Unka Hal Vol:1 Pg:188 (Maktabah Bayyinat)\n\nThereafter, Shias are categorised into three groups in regards to the ruling they fall under:\n\n1.      Those about whom it is certain that they negate the principles of Islam. Such Shias will be regarded as non-Muslims even if they do claim otherwise. Shias have the habit of taqiyyah (i.e. they regard it virtuous to lie in order to safeguard their beliefs); therefore, their word will not be accepted, if reliable sources prove otherwise.\n\nIt is not permissible to have inter-marriages with such Shias, Janazah Salaah will not be performed upon their deceased, the meat from the animals slaughtered by them will not be halaal and all other laws confined to Muslims will not apply to them.  \n\n2.      Those who do not negate any principles of Islam, but have a difference of opinion with the Muslims on saying that Ali (Radiyallahu Anhu) was the most superior amongst all the Sahabah (Radiyallahu Anhum). Such Shias will not be regarded as non-Muslims, but they will still be regarded as fasiqs (those who transgress the laws of Islam openly).\n\nThe laws confined to Muslims will apply on them, but it will not be advisable to have inter-marriages with them. \n\n3.      Those whose beliefs cannot be confirmed. They will not be regarded as Muslims nor will they be regarded as non-Muslims.\n\nAs a matter of precaution, inter-marriages with them will not be permissible and the meat from the animals slaughtered by them will not be halaal.\n\nJawaahirul Fiqh Vol:1 Pg:59-63 (Maktabah Darul Uloom Karachi)\n\nAs far as ties with Shias are concerned, it is not permissible to have close friendship with them. However, Islam encourages Muslims to have good conduct with them, and show good character.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nM.
