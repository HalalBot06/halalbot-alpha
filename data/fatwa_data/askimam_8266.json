Can she remain a virgin till death or adopt children alone? 4) Can a person do the lottery (gamble) but then donate ALL the winnings- every single penny to charity?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. No, it will not break.\n\n2. The rewards of reading the Qur?aan will only be received if it is read in Arabic. (Contemporary Fataawa pg.225)\n\n3. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has said, ?Nikah is my Sunnah. Whosoever turns away from my Sunnah, then he is not from my followers.? This Hadith shows the importance of Nikah and especially in these times of Fitnah, Nikah is more emphasised to save a person from falling into many evils such as Zina, etc.\n\n4. No, it will not be permissible to do lottery in any circumstances even if you have a good intention.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
