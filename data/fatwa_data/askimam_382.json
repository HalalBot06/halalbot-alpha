  "question": "Is it permissible to say Khuda Haafiz when departing from a friend?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe word, 'Khuda Haafiz' is a Du'aa literally meaning 'May Allah protect'.\n\nThere is no prohibition in mentioning 'Khuda Haafiz' before departing from\none another. However, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) taught us the\nfollowing Du'aa before departing, 'Astawdi-u Allaaha Deenakum, Wa\nAmaanatikum Wa khawaatim a'amaalikum' (Trans: I entrust Allah your\nsteadfastness in religion and Deeni actions till death).\n\nIt was also a habit of two Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) to recite Surah\nal-Asr to one another before departing in order to remind one another the\nimportance of time.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
