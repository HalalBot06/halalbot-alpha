It will not be permissible to use a third person’s sperm under any circumstance. (Jaami’ul Fatawa, Pg: 469, Vol: 1)\n\nIf there is a genuine fear of the child inheriting some sickness or disease from the genes of either of the parents, it will be permissible for the couple to opt for PGD as this is a form of treating a sickness. Shari’ah encourages that one undergoes treatment for sickness and disease.\n\nIt is not permissible to opt for PGD to determine the gender of the child as this will be tantamount to interfering with the system of Allah Ta’ala. One should be content with the decree of Allah Ta’ala. Allah is the wisest and chooses what is best for His servants. Allah Ta’ala mentions in the Holy Qur’aan, “He (Allah) grants female offspring to whomsoever he wishes and grants male offspring to whomsoever he wishes.” (Al Shura, Verse: 49)\n\nيهب لمن يشاء إناثا ويهب لمن يشاء الذكور\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
