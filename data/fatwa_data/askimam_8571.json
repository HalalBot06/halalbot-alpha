  "question": "During the 40 days of Nifaas (post-natal bleeding), is it permissible to remove hair from the body, to cut ones nails or to have a bath/shower?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Makrooh to trim or cut the unwanted hair or nails in the state of\nimpurity. (Bahishti Zewar vol.2 pg.83 ZamZam)\n\nThis would refer to the period of Nifaas as well. However, it is also\nMakrooh to allow the unwanted hair and nails to grow for more than 40 days\nor so long that water does not flow freely over the skin under the nails and\nthat dirt does not accumulate under it.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
