  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-o-alaikum Mufti saab, I have a few questions. These questions are from different areas but the reason I'm writing them in one mail is that the daily question quota fills up pretty fast on your website. So please be patient with me. I'll really appreciate your reply. 1) In the Fajr salaat, sometimes due to my weakness I wake up a little late and I dont have the time to perform the sunnah, as soon as i reach the mosque, the iqamah starts. What should I do then? Should I join the Fardh salaat or perform the sunnah separately and join the salaat? If I join the Fardh salaat, which is the best time to perform the sunnah that is due? 2) What are the etiquettes and sunnah way of sleeping? 3) Can we read just the Ayat-ul Kursi in the salaat? My neighbor told me that its one ayat and we have to read minimum 3 Ayats in a rakaat after the Surah Fateha. 4) What things should be done after a new muslim takes shahadah? like asking him to do ghusl, taharah, teaching salaat and so on. Can you please describe these in sequence? Please make dua for me and my family and for the whole Muslim Ummah. Jazakallah Khair. Arshad Ahmed.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If you are confident that you will get at least one Rakaat with the Jamaat, perform your Sunnah first and thereafter join the Jamaat. If you miss your Sunnah and join the Fardh Jamaat, you cannot perform the Sunnah according to the Hanafi Madhab. According to the Shaafi?ee Madhab, one may perform the Sunnah after the Fardh Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The following are the etiquette of sleeping:%0D%0A%0D%0Aa. Go to bed with Wudhu.%0D%0Ab.
