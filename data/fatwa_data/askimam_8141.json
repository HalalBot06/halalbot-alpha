  "answer": "QUESTION\nI came to USA to do PhD, after finishing I went back to my Muslim country but I did not find an appropriate job so I came back and now I have started working here. I had a contract with my govt. that I will serve them for 5 years or otherwise I pay back whatever was spent on me. What shall I do I feel guilty. There is no job for me back home and I cannot pay back what was spent on me. Please advise me what shall I do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs a Muslim, you are required to fulfil your commitments. If you have not served the government of your country, you are required to repay the money spent on you by the government.\n\nSince you have found an alternate job in the US, you are now liable to repay the government of your country. If you are unable to repay your government, you should communicate that to them and request for a waiver.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
