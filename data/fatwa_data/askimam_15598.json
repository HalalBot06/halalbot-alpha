  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n Will the human being will have their original form when they will enter in the Jannath? And will they have the fifth sense what they have now in this world? Will they have the desire for sex or not?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nNabi (صلى الله عليه و سلّم ) is reported to have said, “Verily the people of Jannah (Paradise) will be young, beardless and hairless (i.e. they will have no hair under the arms and below the navel). They will be the height of Adam (AS), the age of Eesaa (AS) (i.e. 33 years), they will be fair in colour and will wear green clothes…” (Tambeehul Ghafileen, pg 37)\n\n \n\nJannah is a place of enjoyment and pleasure, one who suppresses his desire in this world will enjoy the bounties of Jannah. Nabi (صلى الله عليه و سلّم) is reported to have said that a Jannati (a person of Jannah) will be given so much and so much of strength to have intercourse. (Tirmizi)\n\n \n\nIn another hadith, Nabi (صلى الله عليه و سلّم) has mentioned that, “A person in Jannah will enjoy in one day hundred virgin maidens. (Hoors)”.\n\n \n\nHowever Jannah is a pure place and therefore there will be intercourse without semen ejaculation. Furthermore, the women of Jannah will not become pregnant. (Ibid)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
