  "answer": "QUESTION\nQ3. Is it permissible to have a job as an armed security guard at an airport in the UK? If so: Will it be permissible for me to arrest, or maybe shoot at hijackers that may be ?Muslims??\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is important to understand a few principles before issuing a ruling on a Muslim joining a police force in the UK.\n\n1. In principle, a Muslim residing in a non-Muslim country must abide by all the rules of that country that are not un-Islamic.\n\n2. It is not permissible for a Muslim to put himself in an embarrassing and disgraceful situation.\n\n3. Safety and security is an integral part of any country, Muslim or non-Muslim. Even Muslims residing in a non-Muslim country are in need of protection by the state.\n\nIn view of the above mentioned principles, it is permissible for a Muslim to join the police force / armed force in the UK. It will also be in order to arrest Muslims who violate the safety and security measures of a country that threaten the lives of law abiding citizens, Muslims and non-Muslims.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
