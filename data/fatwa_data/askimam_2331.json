  "question": "Is it permissible for a girl to chat to her elder (male) cousins on net ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nActually my cousins lives in U.K. and they are just like my brothers but the thing is that they don?t know much about Islam so we usually discuss on different topics and make things clear to each other . We don?t chat to each other everyday but once in a week and sometimes once in a month . So is it permissible to chat to your family members not for the sake of fun or enjoyment but in order to tell them something which help them .\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for you to chat with your male cousins in UK. You may\nrefer them to reliable Islamic sites or advise them to refer to their local\nUlama in the UK.\n\nWe have come across many incidents where boys and girls have 'sincere' chat\nsessions that lead to a promiscuis relationship.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
