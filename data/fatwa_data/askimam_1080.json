  "question": "What is the Islamic view on a life of celibacy? What are your views on my position and marriage?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is the Islamic view on a life of celibacy? I am a young Muslim man with homosexual tendencies, which I have acted on in the past. I now recognise that acting upon my desires is a great sin in Islam and I?ve sworn never to repeat it, because I understand that this one of many tests I must overcome. I have now managed to stay clear of such sin for over a year now and was wondering how do I go about repenting for sins committed in the past? What can I do to overcome my sexual desires? That keeps surfacing because I now, also understand that masturbation is a sin in Islam. I would like to know what Islam says about celibacy, because I am at the age now, were most young men marry in order to subdue their sexual feelings. As I have no true desires towards the opposite sex this solution is ineffective to me. Please tell me your views on my position and marriage. Could you please answer all my questions and email me back if possible, please.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Kindly ref our reply to a similar query below%0D%0A2. Probably, your non attraction to the opposite sex is due to your past%0D%0Ahabit. We suggest that the feeling of the past be subdued through marriage.%0D%0AThe experience of marriage will enhance your feeling to the opposite sex.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah is Most Gracious and Most Merciful. He says in the Noble Qur'aan, 'Oh%0D%0AMy Slaves! Do not despair. Verily Allah will forgive all sins.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIn one Hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have%0D%0Asaid, 'If a person has sins equivalent to the foams of the sea and pebbles%0D%0Aon a desert, Allah's mercy is so encompassing that He will forgive every%0D%0Asin.' In another narration, it is mentioned that Allah will speak secretly%0D%0Ato one of His slaves on the day of Qiyaamat and remind him of all his sins.%0D%0AAfter the person will confess his sins, Allah will say to him, 'I concealed%0D%0Ayour faults in the world, today too, I will conceal your faults. Go in%0D%0AJannah, I have forgiven you.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above mentioned are few of many Ahaadith explaining the extent of%0D%0AAllah's Mercy. However, Allah says, 'Verily Allah will not forgive a person%0D%0Awho ascribe partners (commit Shirk) with Him.' The only sin that is%0D%0Aunforgivable is Kufr (disbelief) and Shirk (ascribing partners). Accepting%0D%0AIslam is the only atonement for the sin of Kufr and Shirk.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
