  "question": "Can a girl or a women work, if yes than in what circumstances.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMaulana saheb, I  came across a situation where a separation occurred in a family as the husband and his family were very possessive to asking the wife to pay for house bills and give her full pay for daily running of the family.\n\nthis is a story of a newly wed, just married for about five months and the family started to have some problems.  During reconciliation where I was involved, I came across a situation where the girls family demanded that if the girl intends to come back into this house she will have to give her full wages to run the family house.  (the family has this couple, his parents, husbands brother and a yateem cousin of theirs- a total of about 6 in the house)\n\nThe girl, in this case is nearing completion of her degree in accounting after completion of this final unit she is studying.  Know the issue-\n\nI)  Can a girl or a women work, if yes than in what circumstances.\n\n        Take 's scenario, we have a lot of Muslim sisters working-  What is the role of her husband when your wife works.\n\nIs it proper for the in-laws to demand all wages from the daughter-in law for the running of the house when they are capable of running it without her wages?\n\nCan you please share some light in this.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThere are three issues that need to be discussed regarding the query:\n\n1)      It is the duty of the husband to provide the wife with food clothing and shelter; and the duty of the wife is to do the domestic work of the house, not to earn a living for the husband and his family. Moreover, it is the husband’s duty to look to the needs of his parents, his brother, etc.\n\n            Bahishti Zewar (English Translation) Vol:1 Pg:413-416 (ZamZam Publishers)\n\n2)      It is not permissible for a woman to work in such a place where she has to interact with men and the Shari’ purdah is not adhered to. However, if she takes up a job that does not require the intermingling of sexes, and the Sahri’ purdah is not violated while travelling for work, then it would be permissible.\n\n            Aapke Masaail aur Unka Hal Vol:8 Pgs:69 & 91 (Maktabah Ludhyanwi)\n\n           Fatawa Mahmoodiyyah Vol:17 Pg:305 (Kutub Khana Mazhari)\n\n3)      Even if the wife does a job that is permissible, it is a shameful act for the husband to expect the wife to earn a living for him, let alone asking her to earn for his family.\n\n        Fatawa Mahmoodiyyah Vol:3 Pg:265 & Vol:17 Pg:305 (Kutub Khana Mazhari)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
