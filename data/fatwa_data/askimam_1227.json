  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am separated and was told that someone has practiced witchcraft (Jadu) on my wife and she'd left me for that. What can I do, any duas that can be read from Quran for that. Please help me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is incorrect to jump to conclusions without supporting proof.\n\nWe suggest the dispute between you and your wife be mediated by\nrepresentatives from both sides as is the injunction of the Qur'aan. You\nshould sincerely make Du'aa to Allah to assist you in the cause. We advise\nyou also recite 'Yaa Lateef' abundantly.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
