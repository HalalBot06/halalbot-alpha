  "question": "I want to get married again because wife doesnt want anymore children. Do i need her consent.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs Salamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Dear Shaykh.I am happily married considering most marriages where people are from different countries. But i have a problem with my wife as regards to her not wanting anymore children and i do. The reason i do is because i want the muslim ummah to grow. But she doesnt understand. Can i on these grounds get myself another wife? Do i need her consent for this? I have a candidate already who is willing to marry me and have children, may i communicate with her as regards to wedding arrangements?.Jazzak Allah Khairah thank you for your time.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTechnically, for the Nikah to be valid, you do not require her permission.\n\nGiven our society, and women's frame of mind, how do you think she will feel\nonce she hears about it? You will definitely not be able to hide it forever.\nShe will be shattered and heartsore. The mutual confidence will be broken\nand your marriage will be in turmoil. From dealing with such cases, we can\nsay that you will be living in misery.\n\nThe honourable and correct method would be that you discuss the matter with\nher. Even if she does not totally agree, which is obviously rare, at least,\nthere will be some degree of mutual understanding. Like in the case of all\nmarriages, arrangements with the prospective bride should be conducted in a\ndignified manner, preferably, via her elders.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
