  "question": "what should be done if the wife is afraid of having sexual intercourse?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsallam o Alaikum 1) What should be done if the wife is afraid of having sexual intercourse for the first time? This is because of the fear of blood coming out. 2) I had a wet dream and the bed sheets became dry with semen stains. I changed into new clothes after making wudu and had a ghusl. Normally if I have a wet dream I probably end up washing the bed linen after 2 or 3 weeks. Can I continue to sleep on the same unwashed bed sheet without committing a sin, or do I have to wash it? 3) After having sexual intercourse, do we have to wash the bedsheets and quilt cover? Or can the impurities dry up and we can sleep within the same bedsheets and quilt cover? 4) When a women gets excited during foreplay and she releases a fluid, does she have to have a bath or does istinga suffice? Please answer the questions as full as possible.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is only natural for a woman to suffer some form of anxiety at her\nfirst sexual encounter. Every woman goes through this phase. However, the\nlove for her partner or her willingness to please him or her passion\novercomes this fear, thus, enabling her to succumb. The husband should be\nvery gentle and understanding of her anxiety. He should attempt to allay her\nfears and attempt penetration only after extensive foreplay. The key word\nhere is, 'gentle.'\n2. It is better to wash the affected area. However, it is not a sin to sleep\non it.\n3. Yes, you may sleep on it. However, it is best to change the sheets.\n4. Ghusl only becomes compulsory if she reached orgasm. In the case you\nmention, this is pre-coital fluid. Hence, Istinjaa will become will suffice.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
