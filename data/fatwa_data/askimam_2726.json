  "question": "Salaam Aleikum. I work with a brother who is a member of the Nation of Islam here in the US. How do I approach him as a Muslim? Or is he not considered one? How may I bring him closer to Islam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAlthough he says he believes in the Noble Qur'an and the Hadith, he completely ignores and denies some of the messages revealed in the Noble Qur'an. He's converted 10 years ago and has never read the Qur'an (at least in Arabic, but he disagrees?\"the Quran doesn't have to be in Arabic only\"). His entire knowledge of the Islam is based on the principles of what his leader preaches. He reads the Bible to find answers that pleases him better than the Words of Allah in the Noble Qur'an. For example, he believes that Jesus was the son of Mary AND Joseph; hence not the son of virgin Mary solely. He asked me, \"Why would Allah go against His own rule and have a woman give birth to a child without a man in the scene?\" May Allah forgive him for questioning His Will. Therefore, in this case he denies the Bible for believing that Jesus was not the son of god, and he also denies the Noble Qur'an, \"We breathed into (the sleeves of) her (shirt or garment) through our Ruh (Gibril), and We made her and her son 'Isa?\" He completely denies this! I have also observed that he constantly quotes, \"Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us?\". And based on one of their Priciples of Belief, \" WE BELIEVE that Allah (God) appeared in the Person of Master W. Fard Muhammad, July, 1930; the long-awaited \"Messiah\" of the Christians and the \"Mahdi\" of the Muslims. How do you comment on all this, Imam? Allah Ta'ala Knows Best. Jazakallah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nBased on the details of your question you need to approach this friend with\na lot of wisdom because at the moment he is being misguided by the message\nof the nation of Islam. Firstly you need to engage him in discussions on the\nHoly Quraan and the importance of reading it in Arabic because of the Salaah\nand other aspects of the Ibadah. Also you need to take him to someone\neducated in the Deen to explain to him the concept of the power that Allah\ncan do whatever He pleases by just saying \"Be at it will be.\" You need also\ntake him to the talks that you attend and give him litrature that would\nassist him in his beliefs. The one thing you need to show is patience in\nyour dawah to this friend and not forgetting to make dua for him.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
