  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIMAM ABU HANIFA (R.A.H.). %0D%0A1. No`man bin Thabit ibn Zauti,- well known in Islamic History as IMAM ABU%0D%0AHANIFA and IMAM AZAM - was the son of a Persian merchant.%0D%0A%0D%0AHe was born in Kufa, Iraq - in the Year 80 A.H.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. His father -THABIT - was privileged to meet Hazrat ALI%0D%0A(RAD) who had at the time, made KUFA his capital.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Kufa was founded in 17 A.H. by Hazrat Umar ibn Khattab (RAD) the 2nd Khalif.%0D%0A%0D%0AKufa had become the THIRD most important centre of learning during the Hazrat%0D%0AUmar's Khilafat.%0D%0A%0D%0AA large number of SAHABA (RAD) were sent to this new city%0D%0Ato settle here by Umar (RAD). These included HAZRAT%0D%0AAbdulla ibn Ma'sood, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, Ammar, Huzaifa%0D%0A& Abu Moosa etc. (RAD).%0D%0A%0D%0ARecords indicate the presence of 1050 Sahaba in Kufa of%0D%0Awhom 24 were the participants of BADR.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. At the age of twenty, Imam Abu Hanifa turned his%0D%0Aattention towards the pursuit of advancing his Islamic%0D%0AKnowledge.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Among his FIRST and the most important TUTORS was Imam%0D%0AHammad (Died 120 A.H.) whose educational lineage is%0D%0Alinked with Hazrat Abdulla Ibn Mas`ood (RAD).%0D%0A%0D%0A6. Imam Abu Hanifa is also a TABI-EE = One who saw and%0D%0ABenefited from atleast ONE SAHABI.%0D%0A%0D%0A7. Imam Abu Hanifa benefited from nearly 4,000 Shaikhs.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn those days, the Hajj season was the best means of%0D%0Aspreading and deriving Islamic knowledge as Muslims from%0D%0Aevery corner of the Islamic world assembled in Makka.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn his lifetime Imam Abu Hanifa is reputed to have%0D%0Aperformed fifty Hajj.%0D%0A%0D%0A8. Imam Abu Hanifa (Rah) had joined his father's business%0D%0Awherein he showed scrupulous honesty and fairness.%0D%0A%0D%0AOnce his agent had sold a consignment of silk cloth on%0D%0Ahis behalf but forgot to mention a slight defect to the%0D%0Acustomers. When Abu Hanifa learnt of this, he was greatly%0D%0Adistressed because he had no means of the refunding the%0D%0Acustomers; so he immediately ordered the entire proceeds%0D%0Aof the sale ( 30,000 Dirhams ) to be given in charity.%0D%0A%0D%0AIMAM ABU HANIFA (R.A.H.). PAGE TWO%0D%0A9. The Imam was also keenly interested in education.%0D%0A%0D%0AHe established a school at Kufa, which later became a%0D%0Afamous College of Theology. Here he delivered Lectures on%0D%0AIslamic Law and related subjects.%0D%0A%0D%0A10. FIQAH or Islamic Law was systematically studied by his%0D%0Astudents under his expert guidance.%0D%0A%0D%0AA large number of his devoted and highly intelligent%0D%0Astudents worked under him for THIRTY years, and it is the%0D%0ALabour of these students that gave us the HANAFI SCHOOL%0D%0Aof thought.%0D%0A%0D%0A11. Imam Abu Hanifa was the first of the IMAMS to advocate%0D%0Athe use of \"REASON\" in the consideration of Religious%0D%0AQuestions based on the QURAN & SUNNAH.%0D%0A%0D%0A12. He was also the FIRST Imam to Arrange all the subjects of%0D%0AISLAMIC LAW SYSTEMATICALLY.%0D%0A%0D%0A13. His most important work is the KITAAB-UL-AASAAR which%0D%0Awas compiled by his students - Imam ABU YUSUF & IMAM%0D%0AMUHAMMAD.%0D%0A%0D%0A14. In %7B164 A.H.%7D 763 A.C. AL-MANSOOR - the Banu Abbas%0D%0AKhalifa of the Muslim Empire at Baghdad whose capital%0D%0Awas BAGHDAD - offered Imam Sahib the POST of CHIEF QAZI%0D%0Aof the state, but the Imam declined to accept the post%0D%0Aand chose to remain independent In his reply to AL-%0D%0AMansoor, the Imam excused himself by saying that he did%0D%0Anot regard himself fit for the post offered. Al-Mansoor,%0D%0Awho had his own ideas and reasons for offering the post,%0D%0Alost his temper and accused the IMAM of lying.%0D%0A%0D%0A\" IF I AM LYING\" the Imam said, \"THEN MY STATEMENT IS%0D%0ADOUBLY CORRECT\".%0D%0A%0D%0A\"HOW CAN YOU APPOINT A LIAR TO THE EXALTED POST OF A%0D%0AChief Qazi ?\".%0D%0A%0D%0AIncensed by this reply, AL Mansoor charged the Imam%0D%0Awith contempt, had him arrested and locked in prison.%0D%0A%0D%0A15. Even in prison, the Imam continued to teach those who%0D%0Awere permitted to come to him.%0D%0A%0D%0AIMAM ABU HANIFA (R.A.H.). PAGE THREE%0D%0A%0D%0A16. It was here in prison that the Imam was administered a%0D%0Adose of poison in 150 A.H.%0D%0A%0D%0ARealizing that the end was near, the Imam prostrated in%0D%0Aprayer and PASSED AWAY in this condition in the month of%0D%0ARAJAB, 150 A.H.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe news of his death soon spread throughout Baghdad%0D%0A%0D%0A17. The whole town came out to pay their last homage to the%0D%0Agreatest Imam of Islamic LAW.%0D%0A%0D%0AMore than 50,000 people participated in the first Janaza%0D%0ASalaat.%0D%0A%0D%0APeople continued to flock and before the Janaza could be%0D%0Afinally taken for burial, the Salaatul Janaza was offered%0D%0ASIX TIMES in all.%0D%0AFor days, people came in large numbers to pay their%0D%0Arespects at the grave side.%0D%0A%0D%0A18. Among the FOUR Imams, Abu Hanifa has the largest number%0D%0Aof followers even today in all parts of the world%0D%0A%7BM.A.R.K.%7D%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AIMAM MAALIK ibn ANAS. (Rah). PAGE ONE%0D%0A%0D%0A1. ABU ABDULLAH Malik ibn Anas ibn Malik ibn Abi Aamir (Rah)%0D%0A%0D%0Awas born in Madina in the year 93 A.H. (714 A.C)%0D%0AHe came from a respectable family.%0D%0A%0D%0A2 His ancestral home was in Yemen, but his great - Aamir -%0D%0Agrandfather settled in Madina after embracing Islam.%0D%0A%0D%0A3 His grandfather - Maalik - was an important Taabi-ee and%0D%0Aa famous reporter of Ahadith.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. He was greatly attracted to the study of Islamic Law and%0D%0Adevoted his entire interest to the subject after%0D%0Acompleting his primary education.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Madina was the most important seat of Islamic learning as%0D%0Athe immediate descendants of the Sahaba-e-Kiraam were%0D%0Ainhabitants of the City.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. For the purpose of his study, he sought out over THREE%0D%0AHUNDRED \"TA-BI-EEN\" = those who saw the Sahaba %2F%0D%0ACompanions of the Holy Prophet (SAW), and acquired from%0D%0Athem the knowledge of the Holy Prophet's (SAW)%0D%0AAhadith and Sunnah.%0D%0A%0D%0A7. He spent his entire life in Madina where he studied FIQAH%0D%0Afrom NINE FIVE SHAIKHS. It is from these Shaikhs from%0D%0Awhom he recorded the Ahadith in his Kitaab-ul-Muatta.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis Kitab contains 1725 Ahadith of Rasulullah (SAW).%0D%0A%0D%0A8. He studied QIRA`AT & Hadith for nearly ten years under%0D%0AHazrat NAAFE` the slave of Hazrat Abdullah ibn Umar%0D%0A(RAD). Hazrat Naafe` had served his master for nearly 30%0D%0Ayears.%0D%0A%0D%0ANaafe` was once sent by UMAR ibn ABDUL AZIZ (Rah) to%0D%0Aimpart knowledge in Egypt.%0D%0A%0D%0A9. Although he is the author of numerous books, his most%0D%0Aimportant work is the KITAB-UL-MUATTA, which deals with%0D%0Athe subject of Islamic Law based on Ahadith and Sunnah.%0D%0AThe Kitab-ul-Muatta is the earliest surviving Book of%0D%0Ait's kind %7B WRITTEN around 150 A.H. %7D and it is used in%0D%0Aall Islamic Institutions as one of the TEXT Books in the%0D%0Afinal year studies by Graduating ULAMA.%0D%0A%0D%0A10. Imam Malik had the highest regard for the Holy Prophet%0D%0A(SAW) as well as for his Ahadith. He never tolerated%0D%0Aindiscipline whilst Hadith-e-Rasul was under discussion.%0D%0A%0D%0AHe even rebuked Al-Mansoor for talking LOUDLY when%0D%0Asome Ahadith were being discussed.%0D%0A%0D%0AIMAM MAALIK ibn ANAS. (Rah). PAGE TWO%0D%0A%0D%0A11. The Imam always made Wudu or Ghusal, wore fresh clean%0D%0Aattire and applied perfume before conducting lessons on%0D%0AAhadith.%0D%0A%0D%0A12. He delivered lectures on Islamic Law, & issued Fatwas (%0D%0AIslamic Rulings) for nearly 62 years. Approx. 1,300%0D%0Apeople have reported Ahadith from him.%0D%0A%0D%0A13. He had the honour of occupying the home of Hazrat%0D%0AAbdullah ibn MAS`UD (Rad) and conducting lessons from the%0D%0Asame spot where Rasulullah (SAW) spent his time for%0D%0AI'tikaaf, in the Masjid-un-Nabi.%0D%0A%0D%0A14. Imam Malik was famous for his PIETY, and INTEGRITY and%0D%0Acourageously stood up, and was prepared to suffer for his%0D%0Aconviction.%0D%0A%0D%0AFor example, in 135 A.H., When the governor of Madina%0D%0Ademanded and forced people to \"TAKE THE OATH of%0D%0AALLEGIANCE in favour of Khalifa Al-Mansoor, the Imam%0D%0Aissued a Fatwa that such an oath was not binding because%0D%0Ait was given under duress.%0D%0A%0D%0A15. Since this FATWA was not in the interest of the Ruler,%0D%0Athe governor arrested the Imam and had him publicly%0D%0Aflogged for the \" CRIME \".%0D%0A%0D%0AAl Mansoor learning of this outrage, apologized to the%0D%0AImam and dismissed the errant governor.%0D%0A%0D%0A16. Imam Malik (Rah), was offered 3,000 gold coins (DINARS)%0D%0Aby Mansoor, as travelling expenses to Baghdad and%0D%0Asubsequent residence in the Capital, but the Imam%0D%0Apolitely refused the offer saying that he prefered to%0D%0Alive in Madina near Rasulullah (SAW)%0D%0A%0D%0A17. Imam Malik never intended the formation of a SCHOOL OF%0D%0ATHOUGHT bearing his Name. It was his disciples &%0D%0Afollowers who later developed a FIQAH SCHOOL based on%0D%0AImam Malik's rulings.%0D%0A%0D%0A18. Malikis are found mostly in North & West Africa - Tunis,%0D%0AAlgeria, Morrocco and Egypt.%0D%0A%0D%0A19. This Great Leader of Islamic Law died in Madina on the 11%0D%0Ath Rabi-ul-Akhir 179 A.H. at the age 86 years. He lies%0D%0ABuried in the Jannatul Baqi in Madina.

It was due to the recommendation of IMAM%0D%0AMUHAMMAD -the state QAZI and student of%0D%0AImam Abu Hanifa that Imam Shafiee was discharged. He was%0D%0Athen 34 years old.%0D%0A%0D%0A9. Imam Shafi-ee remained in Baghdad as a student of Imam%0D%0AMuhammad for over%0D%0Athree years to add further to his knowledge of Islamic%0D%0ALaw.%0D%0A%0D%0A10. He returned to Makka where he stayed for NINE YEARS%0D%0Adelivering lectures%0D%0Aon Islamic Law. It was during this period that Imam%0D%0AAhmad ibn Hambal came%0D%0Ainto contact with Imam Shafi-ee.%0D%0A%0D%0A11. In 199 A.H., he went to Egypt where he was received with%0D%0Amuch honour and respect.%0D%0A%0D%0A12.

(RAH). Page One%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Abu Abdullah Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Hambal Shaibani Al-%0D%0AMaruzi was of pure Arab descent whose ancestery joins%0D%0AHazrat Ebrahim A.S.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. He was born in BAGHDAD in the month of Rabi-ul-Awwal, 164%0D%0AA.H. He lost his father when he was only three years old.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Baghdad being the Capital of the Muslim State was an%0D%0Aimportant centre of learning during the Banu Abbas Era.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Imam Ahmad Hambal (RAH) completed Hifz of the Quran at an%0D%0Aearly age.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. In 180 A.H.,when he was SIXTEEN years old, he began to%0D%0Apersue the Knowledge of Ahadith under the Imam ABU YUSUF%0D%0A( the most important pupil of Imam ABU HANIFA (RAH).%0D%0A%0D%0A6. He stayed with him for Three years, during which time he%0D%0Arecorded so much information, that the volumes filled%0D%0Athree book shelves.%0D%0A%0D%0A7. Later he also attended the classes of Imam Muhammad (%0D%0Aanother prominent pupil of Imam Abu Hanifa (RAH).%0D%0A%0D%0A8. After accumlating knowledge from numerous scholars in%0D%0ABaghdad, he journeyed to KUFA, BASRA, MAKKA, MADINA,%0D%0AYEMEN, SYRIA, JAZIRA in order to increase his knowledge%0D%0Aof Ahadith.%0D%0A%0D%0A9. After meeting with over a hundred SHAIKHS, he is reputed%0D%0Ato have made a collection of over a million Ahadith.%0D%0A%0D%0A10. It was in 187 A.H., that he met IMAM SHAFI-EE (RAH) in%0D%0AMakka for the first time. Later when Imam Shafi-ee came%0D%0Ato Baghdad, Imam Hambal also joined him during the Imam's%0D%0Aresidence here and mastered from him FIQAH.%0D%0A%0D%0A11. Imam Shafi-ee (RAH) too on the other hand relied very%0D%0Amuch on the knowledge of Ahadith & Sunnah which Imam%0D%0AAhmad Hambal (RAH) possessed.%0D%0A%0D%0A12. It was in 204 A.H., only after he had reached the age of%0D%0Aforty, that Imam Ahmad Hambal (RAH) started conducting%0D%0Alessons and delivering lectures.%0D%0A%0D%0A13. Being a prominent figure, his lectures attracted a huge%0D%0Agathering of atleast FIVE THOUSAND students among whom%0D%0Anearly five hundred took down notes daily.%0D%0A%0D%0ALesson Four.%0D%0AIMAM AHMAD IBN MUHAMMAD HAMBAL.

The MU`TAZILA controversy regarding the \"IMMORTALITY &%0D%0ACREATION of the QURAN\" was the cause of much trial in the%0D%0Alife of the Imam, who suffered much over a period of%0D%0Anearly fifteen years.%0D%0A%0D%0A16. The Banu Abbas rulers - AL-MA`MOON & AL-MU`TASIM who were%0D%0Ainfluenced by the Mu`tazila - tried to force the the%0D%0AUlama to accept the Mu`tazila doctrine.%0D%0A%0D%0A17. Being a devotee of the SUNNAH, and an OPPOSER of BID`AT%0D%0Ait fell upon the shoulders of Imam Hambal (RAH) to%0D%0Aoppose this doctrine vigorously.%0D%0A%0D%0A18. AL-MU`TASIM even ordered the flogging & imprisonment of%0D%0Athe Imam for several months.%0D%0A%0D%0AImam Hambal succumbed to the sufferings rather than%0D%0Adeviate from the Beliefs and practices of the Sunnah.%0D%0A%0D%0A19. The sufferings of Imam Hambal ended when AL-MUTAWAKKIL%0D%0Atook over as ruler, restored the traditional teachings of%0D%0AIslam and accorded the Imam the honour befitting the%0D%0Agreat scholar.%0D%0A%0D%0A20. Among his several works, is the ENCYCLOPAEDIA of AHADITH%0D%0Acalled MASNAD, compiled by his son - Abdulla, from his%0D%0Alectures and amplified by references to over twenty eight%0D%0Athousand Ahadith.%0D%0A%0D%0A21. His other important works include a Collection of his%0D%0AFATWAS %7B Islamic rulings on Religious Matters.%7D -%0D%0Acovering over TWENTY VOLUMES.%0D%0A%0D%0AThese FATWAS form the basis of the HAMBALI SCHOOL of%0D%0ATHOUGHT.%0D%0A%0D%0A22.
