  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAsalaam aleykum\n\nCould you please let me know if:\n\n1. Christians who believe in the Trinity is it the same as associating partners with Allah Subhana Watahla and is it an unforgivable sin.\n\n2.  If it true that only Muslims will go to Paradise?\n\n3. If yes, does it mean that Christians have no chance of going to Paradise?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAllah regards the concept of trinity as kufr and shirk. The only forgiveness for this sin is to negate the concept of trinity and believe in the Oneness of Allah and believe in Him as explained and lived by Rasulullah (SAW).\nIt is true that only Muslims will enter Jannah (Paradise).\nAllah says, “Verily the religion (accepted) by Allah is Islam. In another place, Allah says, “And whosoever seeks (a religion) besides Islam, it will not be accepted from him. The above verses are clear that no person believing in any religion besides Islam is accepted by Allah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
