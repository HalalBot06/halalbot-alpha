  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a qestion regarding ,If my earning is halal or not\n\nI have been working in the present company for the past 6 years. This is also my first company after my education. In the Final semester of my M.asters Degree this company has came to our college to recruit the final year students and conducted an examination. I came to know the question paper from my friend of other college, and I was First in the exam. This company had used the same question paper what they used in my friends college before coming to my college. It is common that most of the times , companies use the same question paper in different colleges, and the students tries to find out the question papers from other colleges with the reasons like it could be the same paper or to know the model of the exam. In my case it was the same paper.\n\nAll along these 6 years, some where in my heart it was hurting. 6 months before I wrote everything in an email to the CEO of the company . In the email I also wrote that the only reason I am confessing now, with out thinking about the consequences ,is that I have to face God Almighty, even if I escape here.\n\nI got a replay saying to meet him , when I have a chance. So I met him, he just asked how I came to know the question paper and other things, but he did said any other thing. Infront of him I treid to apologize verbally, but I could not able to do.\n\nWhile writing the email with emotions I also mentioned that , I got 3 awards from the company for good work in this 5 year span , and also I was 2nd in the class, but later ,I realised that I was 4th or 5th in the class. It was a mistake but not my intention which I have not discussed again with CEO.\n\nNow My question is a) Is what I am earning is Halal b) If I change to another company with current position and experience will it be still Halal c) what else I can do to earn in a halal way\n\n\nPlease Let me know answer and relive me from the Burden.\n\nJazakaAllah\n\nFarhaan.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n At the outset, we commend you on your honesty and course of action in this day and age of corporate lies and moral degeneration.\n\nIt is known, normal, and accepted for students to prepare for such exams by seeking help from others who might have already taken them.  Many times, one can find preparation books for these exams in the library with sample questions.  For this reason, companies and examination boards generally have slightly different exam questions each time.  Technically, your company should have also had a different exam for your college if they were concerned about students knowing the exact questions.  Since they did not do this nor did you go against the normal preparation steps with an intention of cheating, your income is halāl.  Furthermore, you even informed the CEO of the company and he did not object to that.\n\nBut as a matter of precaution, we advice you to also make tawbah and istighfār. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
