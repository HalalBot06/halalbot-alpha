  "question": "Is it a sunnah or bidah to shake hands, after the completion of fardh salaat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Sahaab: As-Salaam-O-Alaykum. In our community it is a common practice of mainly arabic speaking musaalee's, to shake hands upon the completion of FARAAD salaat. Many of the folks from the sub-continent have adopted this practice, mainly due to subtule influence(s) of these individuals. A short while ago, I read either in a book or at a web-site, that this paratice is an innovation(BIDAAH) in DEEN, but can't seem to locate the article any more. Would appreciate your explanation regarding this matter in light of the four schools of thought. Jazaa-Allah-O-Khairan. Wa-As-Salaam-O-Alaykum. Regards, Syed Abdul-Wajid\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllamah Shaami (RA) states, 'To practise Musafaha after discharging Salaat\nis Makrooh (detestable) in all conditions since the Sahaaba (companions) had\nnot engaged in this practice after Salaat and also due to this being a\ncustom of the Rawaafidh (Shi'ah). Furthermore, it is narrated from Allaamah\nibn Hajr (RA) of the Shaaf'ee Madhab that this is a detestable Bid'at\n(innovation) without basis in the Shari'ah. Musafahah in the Shari'ah is\nonly when a Muslim meets his (Muslim) brother. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyyah, vol.1\npg.231; Mahmoodiyah)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
