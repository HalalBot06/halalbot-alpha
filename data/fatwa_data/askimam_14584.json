  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAsalamualaikum Mufti,\n\nIf the masjid where i went to join taraweeh prayer does only 8 rakats, is it ok for me to finish 12 rakaats and witr at home.\n\n \n\nThe imam also leads witr with 2 rakaats and 1 rakaat.  Most of my brothers are now performing only 8 rakaats and witr with them no matter how we explain to them that it should be 20 rakaats.  Is it permissible to join witr since it is not 3 rakaats.  Half of my brothers in the family are now doing only 8 rakaats and will not finish the others 12, please advise.\n\n \n\nHow many rakaats of taraweeh performing in Mecca ?  If it’s 8 what should I do because if they do witr directly I would not be able to finish 12 rakaats.\n\n \n\nIf chicken is slaughtered mechanically with the name of Allah (as i was told), is it halal?\nI have a halal restaurant in .  I used chicken breast imported from .  It has a halal certificate.  The brand is Perdix.  Do you know if it’s halal?\nDuring ramadan can we use miswak with lime and mint flavour?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nJazakumullah khairan\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nQuestion 18\n\n \n\n \n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\n1)     You should perform the remaining 12 Rakats Taraweeh and Witr by yourself.\n\n \n\n2)     According to the Hanafi Madhab, Witr is three Rakats with one salaam at the end. If a Hanafi joins the Shafi Imam for example and reads 2 Rakats and one Rakat, then the 2 Rakats will be Nafl. The follower may not read the remaining one Rakat. If he does then he should add another one Rakat and make it another set of Nafl Salah. The Witr will still have to be performed thereafter.\n\n \n\n3)     In Makkah Mukarramah and Madina Munawwarah, 20 Rakats Taraweeh is performed.\n\n \n\n4)     Electronically slaughtered chickens are not Halal.\n\n \n\n5)     We do not know.\n\n \n\n6)     It is Makhrooh (undesirable) to use flavored Miswaak during Fasting.              \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\n Mufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
