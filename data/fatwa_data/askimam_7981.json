  "question": "Is suspicion/spying allowed when the fruits of such efforts prove to be true in reality?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nBy looking through my wife's journals, cell phone,etc I found out that she has been having \"improper communications\" with a \"first love\" both before and during our marriage. I believe this has hurt our marriage. Am I still wrong for spying/suspicion even though what I suspected was actually true? Can you give some daleel in your response?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a husband suspects his wife having improper communication with a stranger, he has the right to investigate, as that attitude will have implications on his marital life.\n\nThe husband has to protect himself and his rights from external and outside interference. If the wife is found guilty after investigating the matter, he has the right to address his wife?s improper communication with the stranger. He cannot leave her free to continue the un-Islamic and Haraam practice.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
