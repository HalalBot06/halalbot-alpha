  "question": "I pray Salaat-ul-Tasbeeh at the time of new year’s eve. The idea is when the disobedience of Allah s.w.t. is at it’s peak in my city, I want to be in a state of Salaat. Anything wrong with this?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nzone are lost in welcoming the new year. I am trying to prove to Allah s.w.t. that I am not one of them, even though I am living among them, and also to thank him for everything he has bestowed upon me, and to ask forgiveness for all my sins.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe commend you for your dedication.\n\nThe rewards of Salaat al-Tasbeeh are enormous. However, by us practicing Deen on our own and not advising those who are far from Deen does not solve the problem. Together with our worship, encourage others on Deen also, hence, the society will become Islamic and all the un-Islamic rituals and norms will disappear.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
