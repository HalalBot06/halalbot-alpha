  "question": "If performing salaat at home, is salaat performed without azaan and iqamah valid? Is the ruling the same for both adhaa and qazah salaat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf there is a Musjid in the locality, then only Iqaamat will suffice. If there is no Musjid in the locality and Adhaan is not called then Adhaan should also be called. There is no Iqaamat and Adhaan for Qadhaa Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
