My friend has been missing since Saturday morning 5 a.m, and we have not been able to find him. He got into a car accident and their car fell in the water. Please get back to me as soon as possible as this involves someone's life.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAllah does whatever He wants according to His infinite wisdom. In such a situation focus on taqdeer and place ones trust in Allah and make dua. May Allah grant all of you courage.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai \n\nDarul Iftaa"
