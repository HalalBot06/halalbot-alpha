  "question": "Am I living in sin? My husband divorced me 3 times in front of two witnesses. We got back together. I have found in many places that if your husband divorces you 3 times you are not halal for him.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy husband divorced me 3 times in front of two witnesses. During the three month iddah period he brought a Fatwa from the London Islamic Mosque stating that 3 talaaqs are counted as one. We got back together. After further research I have found in many places that if your husband divorces you 3 times you are not halal for him.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWhen a man gives his wife (conceived or not) three Talaaqs (verbally or in\nwriting) it is classified as Talaaq Mughallazah (literally meaning three\nTalaaqs; whether these Talaaqs were issued in one sitting or on different\noccasions), they are still valid and regarded as three. They cannot live together as husband and wife.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
