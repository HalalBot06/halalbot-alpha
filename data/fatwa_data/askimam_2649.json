  "question": "Salaam. I am writing because of some confusion about the authenticity of bohris and shias and aga-khanis as muslims. Are these sects to be considered muslims, and why not?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf you could direct me to some literature on the subject. (online or off) it would be greatly appreciated thank you\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0AKindly refer attached%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Bohri community is an off-shoot of the Ismaili sect - part of the Shi'a sect. Shi'as are not Muslims.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ADear Brothers-Sisters%0D%0A%0D%0AAs-Salaamu Alaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0AMay I for the sake of Allah (swt), His Deen and the Muslim Ummaah, request you to please consider the following facts very carefully and decide on your responsibility before Allah (swt) in this matter.%0D%0A%0D%0AI am a revert to Islam. I was an Ismaili before - a follower of the Aga Khan. And I perceive an important Da'wah responsibility which the majority of Muslims are for some reason or other are ignoring. I am not getting you into petty sectarian issues, but a very important matter - please judge for yourself:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. The Ismailis (followers of the Aga Khan) all professedly believe that the Qur'an was time bound and was not meant to be a Universal message for all times. They believe that their spiritual leader, Karim Aga Khan, is the \"walking - talking Qur'an\" and his \"religious pronouncements\", whatever they may be, are the \"guidance\" for the present times. The fundamental article of faith that there will not be any NEW revelations or \"wahy\" after the Qur'an, is being completely violated by the Ismailis.%0D%0A2. The Aga Khan has officially Declared himself, before his followers, as the \"Mazhar of Allah on earth\". The word \"mazhar\" means \"copy\" or \"manifest\". Consequently, these Ismailis who call themselves Muslims do \"sujood\" before him. So even the primary axiomatic principle of Tawheed is being fundamentally and formally violated by them. %0D%0A3. The Ismailis are not instructed to offer the Islamic Salaah, observe Saum or perform Hajj. They have replaced Salaah with certain shirk-infested Dua'as (thrice a day). They are told that their Hajj is a personal \"Glimpse\" (Deedaar) of Karim Aga Khan.%0D%0A4. The Aga Khan and his appointees 'forgive the sins' of the followers on regular basis. Ismailis are misled into believing that they will not be questioned on the Day of Judgment for the sins that are already forgiven in their Jamatkhanas (community centers). Forgiving of sins is the exclusive prerogative and privilege of Allah (swt) alone. Qur'an 3:135.%0D%0A5. Against this backdrop, most of the poor (spiritually poor) Ismailis who are not introduced to al-Furqan are confused and misguided. Hence, Ismailis are very easy prey to missionary efforts by various Christian groups and Baha'is. I have known a couple of young ex-Ismailis who are today preaching \"Pauline Christianity\" to Ismailis as evangelical missionaries. %0D%0A6. Karim Aga Khan's own daughter Zahra having married a practising Christian has opened the gates for young Ismailis girls to follow the footsteps of a family member of their beloved Imam-e-Zaman. The parents of the Ismaili girls who wish to marry outside of Islam have no recourse but to let them go. %0D%0A7. The Aga Khan has made Halaal for the Ismailis that which Allah has made Haraam for the humans. Taking of interest (usury) is not forbidden by the religious instruction classes run by the \"Tariqaah\" board of the Ismailis. As a matter of fact, the much publicized \"Venture Capital\" program (details on the website of FORBES Magazine - search under \"Aga Khan\"), of loaning funds on interest by the AKFED (Aga Khan Fund & Economic Development), has been a great success. Similar entrepreneurial projects are now being actively promoted and introduced to poor Muslims of Tajikistan and neighboring areas.%0D%0A8. The Muslim Ummaah and the various Muslim leaders are not fully aware of these Un-Islamic acts and beliefs of this community of less than two million members, who claim to be the Ismaili Muslims. Surprisingly, their leader Aga Khan claims himself to be a spiritual leader of 15 million Muslims and a Direct Descendant of Prophet Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). %0D%0A9. Earlier, one did not have authentic books on Ismailism, but it is not so anymore. There are two authentic books as well as one comprehensive web site exposing the inner practices of the Ismailis and the Proclamations (Farmans) of the Aga Khans. Hence, now you have no \"hujjah\" argument or excuse left before Allah (swt) for not taking up the task of inviting the misguided \"Ismaili Muslims\" towards the Deen of Allah (swt) and not safeguarding them from committing unpardonable sin of Shirk.%0D%0A10. The Aga Khan in collaboration with so many Western powers and aid, has set up the world-wide Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) which runs several institutions and service companies both in the profit and not for profit sectors. This network is very actively operating in Pakistan, India, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya and Bangladesh, and has now started concentrating its efforts in Tajikistan and the neighbouring areas where there is a concentration of Muslims who have not known or openly practised Islam for the decades. By taking up economical, social, educational and rural development efforts through NGOs (Non-Govt. Organizations) within the AKDN, the Ismailis and the Aga Khan have gained wide acceptance amongst these countries and masses. Hence this urgent appeal. %0D%0A11. Now all these beneficiaries are \"obliged and grateful\" to the Aga Khan and his followers and his organizations for the much-needed schools, medical centers, hospitals, various projects and programmes. In this manner they are penetrating and infiltrating the support system - and one fine day, the Muslim Ummaah will wake up to the unexpected realization that they have a community of so called Muslims, practicing the Un-Islamic Tariqaah, in charge of all core and support activities. Each of these much-needed projects will have the photos of Aga Khan decorating the walls.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the name of Allah (swt) and Islam, kindly urge our Brothers and Sisters to do Da'wah to the Ismailis, who otherwise will, on the day of judgement, hold us responsible for not conveying the Revealed Truth to them. Dear Brother%2FSister, you know much more on the subject than what little I have learnt since reverting to the Deen of Allah (swt). It hurts to see the misguided simple minded people die on SHIRK because we did not amply warn them before their deaths.%0D%0A%0D%0AI am aware of your stature as a religious leader of repute, respectability and acceptance among Muslim Masses, and hence have sought to put this appeal to you. I request you to seriously consider this request and initiate all steps that you consider Wajib and appropriate. To spread the \"Truth\" and eradicate \"Tagoot\" is a significant, major Sunnah of the prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0AMay I also request you to please forward this e-mail to at least five (if not all) of your Muslim friends and activists so that greater awareness of this issue is created, and this request reaches a wider audience. Please do so. JazakAllah.\" %0D%0A%0D%0AIn case you wish to seek any further clarification please feel free to e-mail a message. I will Insh'allah respond. I apologize in advance, if this happens to be a repeat message. %0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah (swt) shower His Choicest Blessings on the entire Muslim Ummah. May Almighty Allah bless you and keep you in the service of Islam and Muslims. Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0AJazak'Allah and Was Salaam,%0D%0A%0D%0AYours in the Service of Islam,%0D%0A%0D%0AAkbarally Meherally%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A"
