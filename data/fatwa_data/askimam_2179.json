  "question": "How come only Hadrat Mariam (Alayhas salaam)'s name is mentioned in the Quran from all the other women?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Qur'aan tells us, 'When the angels said, O Maryam! Indeed you have been\nselected by Allah, He has made you pure and chosen you over the women of the\nworlds.' (Qur'aan)\n\nBeing a mother to the noble Messenger, Eesa (Alayhis salaam) who holds a\ndistinguished position among the Anbiyaa (Alayhimus salaam), it is no wonder\nthat Allah Ta'ala chooses to honour her over other women in this way by\ngiving her name eternal remembrance in His noble Qur'aan.\n\nOne of the reasons for explicitly mentioning the name of Maryam (Alayhas\nsalaam)'s name as the mother of Eesa (Alayhis salaam) is to refute the\nclaims of the Christians that Eesa (Alayhis salaam) is the son of Allah\n(Allah save us) and of some Christians that Maryam (Alayhas salaam) is the\nwife of Allah. 'Neither has He taken a wife nor fathered a son.' (Qur'aan)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n_____________\n<"
