  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a cat and I feed it food that I know is haram. I have heard that buying haram food, even for a pet is a haram transaction. What is your opinion? Is this true? Do I have to start buying hallal food for my cat as it is available but far more expensive? (Note: it is not that I cannot purchase the halal food for my pet. It is simply that it is more expensive and a lot more hassle for me to prepare). Please advice.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nThe information is true.
