  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nASSALAMUYALAYKUM IMAM SAHAB, I would like to know if study accounting is haram because we also calculate  interest when doing the journals.  I also want know if it is lawful for me to drop school and start raising money to do  business because i have lost interest in school and i don't know what to study . I don't  want  to have a career in a company .\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\n1)     Accounting is not Haram. The accountant merely records information. He is not party to the interest deal.\n\n \n\n2)     You should discuss your study issues with your parents and elders. Our advice is Muslims should study and adopt strategic positions to advance the cause of Islam.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
