  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI ll asked how about opinion in Mazhab Hanafi for divorce women when she will married again should be attend by Wali & 2 witness or not?...How Iman Abu Hanidah said regardless?...If not attend by wali & 2 witness that marriege was legal by Islam or not?   Please explain accordingly...Jazakalah Khairan Khatsira\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAccording to Shariah, it is necessary to have two witnesses for the validity of the marriage. If there are two witnesses to the proposal and acceptance of the boy and girl, the Nikah is valid. The presence of the Wali is not a requirement for the validity of the marriage. The same ruling applies to the Nikah of a divorcee.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
