  "question": "I would like to know what the niyat should be of the two rakat nuafl namaz that we were instructed to pray by our beloved Habib Rasulullah (S.A.W)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know what the niyat should be of the two rakat nuafl namaz that we were instructed to pray by our beloved Habib Rasulullah (S.A.W) at times of great loss (for e.g. the expiration of a child or family member etc). “seek patience through salah”, so what is the niyat of this salah suppose to be? Recently a my friends only son died after great suffering, she is new to the rightly guided dawah Tabligh. Her husband is well involved in this work for many years, but she after marriage came to this work, before she was a brelwee. She went to masturat jammat two times leaving this ill son in hospital, and made a lot of dua too. So after the death, when we went to visit her in hospital, we told her to be patient through salah. She wanted to know what niyat to make and what surah’s to read in each rakat. Also in general, when someone’s close relative dies like the mother, father, sister etc. what do you say to them to comfort them, in deeni terms? What do you say to people who cry loudly, loudly saying stuff like “you were my star in the sky…….my dear loved daughter…oh why you die and leave me……why Allah take you from me…..” etc. and pinching the dead’s nose soflty, or shrugging as if trying to wake them up, etc. What do you say to such people? Because our outward dressing and our effort of trying to practice to upon complete deen, they usually ask us stuff like, he was soo nice or small, why Allah make him suffer soo much, or why Allah take him from us etc? what do we say in reply to console them??  jazakallah hukhair for your effort of spreading the haqq deen and your struggle against batil. may Allah except your effort and reawrd you greatly and give us the ability of taking the advantage of benifitting from your board of ullama and their knowledge.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nTo say the following things out of grief on the death of one’s children or close ones: \"Allah had to kill him only\", \"He was the only one left in the world for Allah to kil\", \"Allah should not have done this\" etc. are customs and habits of the disbelievers and they lead to kufr. According to the Shari’ah, the period of mourning is only three days. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'None should mourn the death of a person but for three days.' (Bukhari) One may console and express condolences to the bereaved family. It is advisable for people close to the deceased, friends and relatives to read for the deceased and send the reward for him. There is more ikhlaas and sincerity in that. One should offer du’aas for the bereaved family and deceased, for example: May Allah Ta’ala grant you Sabr, may Allah forgive the deceased, may Allah grant the deceased high stages in Jannah, etc. There is no specific prayer to be performed during the mourning period. One may engage in any prayer without regarding that as compulsory. Allah Ta'ala states, 'O you who believe! Seek assistance through patience and Salaat. Verily, Allah is with the patient ones'.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
