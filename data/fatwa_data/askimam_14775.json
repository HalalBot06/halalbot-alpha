  "question": "I've been thinking very strongly lately that I want wilayah........",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) I've been thinking very strongly lately that I want wilayah. I really want to be closer to Allah(swt) but I'm not sure how to do this. Is it necessary to have the companionship of shaykh? Since I am a woman, how would that work? I really want to work on my spiritual shortcomings but 1) I don't know who there is to follow in Chicago, IL 2) I don't know how it works with shaykhs and female murids. Are there any female shaykhs?\n\n2) When I get my period, usually when it starts and usually when it ends there is no blood flow, I just get blood flakes when I go to the bathroom. Does dry blood like this also count as part of my period? My period only lasts for about 3.5 days total every month, so if this does not count as haydh than I when it starts should I bother to stop praying since it's unlikely it will last a full 3 days (usually the last day and a half is dry blood)?\n\nJazakumullah Khair\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nÂ \n\nThe purpose of life is to recognize Almighty Allah and get close to Him. The recognition of Allah and closeness to Him is the essence and spirit of life. There is no enjoyment of life without the closeness and consciousness of Allah. After all, He created our hearts and minds. It is only when we return our hearts and minds to Allah, will we expirence peace and contentment of life. Otherwise, the heart and mind elsewhere is like fish out of water struggling for survival. Unfortunately, this is the condition of most people. Their hearts and minds are consumed by materialism that can never give peace and contentment to a person as they are mere means. Allah is the Creator of peace and contentment. It is unfair to offer the heart to anything else besides Allah. We come from Allah and return to Allah. The intelligent thing to do is also live with the pleasure, recognition and closeness to Allah. Everything else including our family, parents, children and friends do not deserve our hearts as it is the right of Allah. May our hearts burn away in the flame of the love of Allah, Ameen. You could refer to Shaykh Kamil, Hadrath Mufti Nawalur Rahman Saheb of Devon in Chicago . He is a great spiritual guide and very learned. He is well known in Chicago and all around the . Many people, men and women have benefited from his discourses and advises. He is an Alim of great Taqwa and piety. You will benefit from him Inshallah.\n\nThe blood flakes will be regarded as Haidh. It is not necessary to have a continuous flow of blood during Haidh.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
