  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question is that inssurance policy is allowed according to shariah or not. Secondly now a days as banks give  vehicles on lease(installment) for specific period of time is it right to take benifit or not?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nConventional insurance schemes are not permissible. If by lease you mean hiring, then it is permissible. That will be governed by the Shariah Laws of Ijarah.\n\n \n\nIf by lease you mean installments, then that is ambiguous. It could also mean Murabaha. Please clarify.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
