  "question": "Why scholars have such a conflicting opinion about Maulana Maududi’s scholarship? It’s confusing for a common Muslim like myself.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nA 70-year old Indian scholar, graduate of Deoband and Madinah University, very pious and firebrand preacher, imam in a local Islamic center, often quotes Maulana Maududi in his Friday khutba. He?s of the opinion that Maududi was a great Islamic scholar of all times and a mujaddid of the 20th century. Another scholar in the same town, also a graduate of Deoband, decries Maulana Maududi erudition and belittles his contribution for the revival of Islam. The former considers Tafheemul Quran as an authentic and intellectually written tafseer while the latter disagrees with that claim. Why such a conflicting opinion among Islamic scholars?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly find below our standard response to similar queries.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AA BRIEF HISTORY OF THE MAWDUDI CALAMITY%0D%0A%0D%0AIn order to master any subject, it is incumbent that one remain in the company and benefit from the master of that subject. It is an accepted fact that for any simple or artistic occupation a teacher or even a guide is necessary. Without these even an intelligent and genius cannot reach the desired stage, be it in the fields of engineering, medicine, or any other subject for that matter. For every occupation or trade it is necessary and incumbent that one should at least earn the basics from a teacher. In this manner, when it is necessary to seek knowledge and guidance in materialistic fields, how can it be possible to attain the Uloom of Nubuwwat - teachings of the Ambiyaa (Alayhis salaam) - and the intricacies of the Shari'ah without the guidance of a tutor? The sciences of this nature are beyond the grasp of human intelligence. They have reached the Ummah through the Wahi (revelation) of the Almighty, and continues through heavenly training, rearing, divine commands, instructions and guidance. Then in these Divine Sciences the attention and considerations of the tutor and guide; and the practical participation in his company has a more important bearing than words. The attaining of correct thinking, understanding and practical Tarbiyah (rearing#) is more important than only attaining knowledge. On that ground, the longer the companionship of a master, the more benefit and experience one will reap. The more perfect the tutor, the more benefit and excellence will be attained. As the purpose of the Uloom-e-Nubuwwat is the guidance of the creation of Allah, in its understanding, there is a strong probability, through the enmity of the accursed Shaytaan, to be led astray. The Shaytaan does not interfere where one strives to attain perfection in material aspects. The Shaytaan sits in comfort. He does not need to interfere, nor is it necessary for him to show his enmity. However, where the hereafter and religion are concerned, the Shaytaan becomes restless in creating mischief. He uses his strength in every possible manner, where success and Hidaayat may be turned into ruin and to cause deviation from the straight path. The greatest asset of the accursed Iblis is 'Talbis', that is to mix the truth with falsehood in such a manner, that where a thing outwardly appears to be beneficial, in reality it becomes a source of wrong doing and detriment. Then too, bearing in mind that the tricks of the human Nafs supercedes this, it is human nature to be arrogant, haughty, deceptive, show-off and have love for rank and high status. These are such diseases that it is difficult to eradicate them even after lengthy training and discipline.%0D%0A%0D%0AFor this reason, it is incumbent to remain in the companionship of a master for quite some time, in order to save oneself from the effects of the Shaytaan.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf Allah's grace and mercy are present, then surely one reforms, otherwise, the human just wanders around in the desert of knowledge and intellectualism. After studying the Educational History of the world, this point becomes very clear that all the mischief and chaos that were created, were all at the hands of intellectuals and geniuses. During the period of Ilm (knowledge) a greater portion of Fitna (mischief) appeared by the way of Ilm. Even among the Ulama-e-Haqq, many geniuses due to their sharp intelligence ad accentricity became victims of their wrong thoughts and ideas. This fact became evident that by completely relying on their own acuteness and flowing intellect, they became entangled in Ilm Kibr (educational arrogance), and self-conceited of their own views. They were not fortunate enough to undergo a beneficial amount of spiritual training. As a result, this led them to great lengths. In our times, there exist many such examples. Since thy possess Ilmi acumen and, as many a time they say or write excellently, they become a cause for additional Fitnah. Those individuals who were not fortunate enough to attain a deep knowledge or a spiritual training, easily become their adherents and quickly begin supporting and endorsing their new ideologies. The Shaytaan is always busy in his occupation. A personality that may be of use to guide and direct the Ummah, becomes a means of deviation and ruin for the Ummah. There are examples of these in every era. Imaam Ghazzaaliy (Rahmatullaah Alayhi) has written in his 'Maqaasidul Falaasifah' that after observing the correctness in the elementary and mathematical sciences of the Greeks, the people began to accept all their teachings as correct. They accepted the teachings of the Greeks even in the subjects of Theology and natural philosophy, which led they astray. These words of Imaam Ghazzaaly are very suprising and true. The Shaytaan finds in these situations an ideal opportunity to lead people astray. Well, when the very learned, geniuses and capable can become entangled in such Fitnahs, then those personalities who possess very little Ilmi capabilities and have a tremendous ability to write, and are quick witted and intelligent, but void of a spiritual training under an accomplished master they very quickly become engulfed in self-counceitedness and begin to degrade the Ummah. All the scholarly researches of the Ummah are despised; all the great deeds of the Salafus-Saaliheen are made a joke of and a laughing stock; and by criticising every personality from beginning till the end, falls in deep and dangerous pit, becoming a means of leading all humanity into destruction. Among such people today is a famous personality by the name of Janab Abul-A'ala Maududi Saheb, who was acute and quick witted since childhood, but was troubled by economic difficulties. In the beginning he was employed by the Medina Periodical at Bijnor. Thereafter, he was attached to the 'Muslim', a magazine of the Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind. After a few years, he was employed by the 'Al-Jamiat', Delhi, a journal of the Hamiat Ulama-e-Hind, which was then probably published every third day. His articles captioned, 'Tarikh ke Jawaahir Paaro' appeared with great lustre. In this manner, Maududi Saheb was trained as a writer by Mawlana Ahmad Saeed Saheb. After the death of his father, Maududi Saheb was unable to complete his studies, but had to leave studies during the early Arabic primary stages, nor was he fortunate enough to attain a secular education. He later studied English and attained some competence in it. He greatly benefited from the books, magazines and writings of reputable authors of those days. His writing ability increased by the day. Unfortunately, he was unable to benefit from any religious institution, neither became a graduate of modern education, nor did he gain the company of an experienced and proficient Aalim of the Deen. He has admitted this in an article published during the era of United India in reply to some question posed to him by Mawlana Abdul-Haq Madani Muradabadi. He was unfortunate to experience the company of Niyaaz Fatehpuri, an atheist and infidel.%0D%0A%0D%0ABy this association and friendship many incorrect tendencies and inclinations were adopted. In 1933 he began publishing the 'Tarjumanul Quraan' fro Hyderabad, Dacan, wherein he published spending articles. Some Ilmi and literary things began to appear using the best style and methods. At that time, the political situation in the country was very shaky. The movement to free India was in its decisive stages. The best intellectuals of the country were involved in the freedom struggle of India from the British. Mawdudi Saheb adopted a different stand from the rest and engendered the cry of 'Iqaamat Deen' and 'Hukumate Ilaahiyya'.%0D%0A%0D%0AHe strongly and forcefully criticised all the factions involved in seeking the freedom of India. His simple and innocent pnygyrists thought that Mawdudi Saheb was the last straw for the valuable Deen. As a result, very quickly praises began to be showered upon him from the pens of Mawlana Sayyid Sulaymaan Nadwi, Mawlana Manaazir Ahsan Gilani and Mawlana Abdul-Majid Daryabadi. Evidently, at that time Mawdudi Saheb was only a name of an individual. As yet, he had no missionary aim, nor an association or movement. Due to his forceful writings and statements, some among the Ahle Haqq began having great hopes in him. By virtue of his preparedness and through the encouragement of Chaudri Muhammad Niyaaz, the foundation of Darul Islam was laid in Pathankot. The Muslim League and Congress began to be degraded.%0D%0A%0D%0ASuch articles were written by him, as well as book on the political turmoil of the time appeared whereby he began receiving praises from his followers. The political causes stimulated its acceptance. A meeting was held in Lahore, and the foundation of his Imaarat was formally laid. A speech prepared by him was read out, wherein the duties of a present-day Ameer were outlined. Among the participants were also such famous personalities as Janab Mawlana Manzoor Nu?maani, Mawlana Abul-Hassan Ali Nadwi, Mawlana Amin Ahsan Islaahi and Mawlana Mas?ud Aalam Nadwi. Mawdudi Saheb was elected the Chief Ameer and the abovementioned four personalities were elected deputy Ameers. The Jamaat Islami formally came into existence. Its constitution and charter were published. The public looked forward to it, and from every side hopes began to be attached. Six months had not passed by when Mawlana (Manzoor) Nu?maani Saheb and Mawlana Ali Mia Saheb (Abdul Hasan) resigned.%0D%0A%0D%0AThey had observed his Ilmi deficiencies and lack of sincerity. They were unable to continue their relationship. These gentlemen kept silent and did not inform the Ummah openly and clearly about their reason for disassociating themselves. I was at that time teaching at Jamia Islamia Dabhel. I enquired from these two personalities about their reason for quitting. They said many things, but no satisfactory clarification was given. I understood the view of Marhum Mawlana Mas?ud Aalam and Mawlana Amin Ahsan Islaahi were quire similar as far as beliefs and conduct were concerned. Hence, they remained for some time as Mawdudi Saheb?s right hand men. Mawlana Mas?ud Aalam assisted through the medium of Arabic literary writings and magnificently translated into Arabic the writings of Mawdudi Saheb. He also trained a few pupils in this field. Mawlana Islaahi through his special style and way assisted the Mawdudi moveent, a few excellent books were written on communism and a few other subjects, i.e. interest, alcohol, Purdah, etc. A few good books were also written for the modern youth. Some worthy articles were published in the ?Tafheemaat and Tanqeehaat?. Ways and means were adopted to impress the Arabs, especially the Shaykhs of Saudia Arabia.%0D%0A%0D%0ASuccessful strategies were adopted. All those writings that were contributed by Mawdudi Saheb?s associates were published in such a manner as if all these writers were indebted to him. As a result, the personality of Mawdudi Saheb gained fame. He reaped fame from the writings of his associates. He is incapable of composing in Arabic or English. The names of translators do not appear on his books that are translated in other languages. It is not mentioned that this book is translated by Ma?ud Aalam or Aasim Haddaad. People get the notion that this literally intellectual of the Urdu language, is also an Imaam of the Arabic language. A short period has passed when Mawlana Gilani Saheb and Sayyid Sulaymaan Nadwi Saheb became aware and foresaw its detrimental effect; that these writings were a means of creating a new Fitnah. He (Mawlana Gilani) ceased to address him by the titles conferred on him, such as ?Mutakallim e Islam?, etc. Mawlana Gilani Saheb wrote critical articles under the headings of ?Khaarijiyyate Jadidah? in Mawlana Daryabadi?s ?Sidqe Jadid?. Mawlana Sayyid Husain Ahmed Madani Saheb was perhaps the first among the Ulama who pinpointed this Fitnah in his correspondence. Gradually, other Ulama began to air their views. Shaykhul Hadith Mawlana Muhammad Zakariyyah Saheb studied all the available printed Mawdudi literature and wrote a valuable booklet on this subject. It is regretted that this booklet has not been printed yet. In this connection, an Ustaadh of Madrasah Mazaahirul Uloom, Saharanpuri, Mawlana Zakariyya Quddusi Saheb became inclined towards Mawdudi Saheb. Taking this into view and trying to correct him, Shaykhul Hadith Saheb wrote a letter to him, explaining all Mawdudi Saheb?s errors and incorrect interpretations of the Deen.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis letter has been published in a booklet form titled, ?Fitnah Mawdudiyyat? (It is now reprinted under the title ?Jamaat Islamiyyah, ek lamanah Fikriyyah?).%0D%0A%0D%0AI admired many things about Mawdudi Saheb and detested many. For a long time I did not wish to degrade him. I felt that from his innovated style of presentation, the modern generation could benefit. Although at times such compositions appeared from his that it was not possible to endure it, but taking into consideration the Deeni well-being, I tolerated it and kept silent. I did not forsee that this Fitnah would spread worldwide and have a detrimental effect on the Arab world; that every day from his master pen new bud would keep on blossoming and indecent words would be used regarding the Sahaaba Kiraam (Radhiallaahu Anhum) and the Anbiyaa (Alayhimus salaam). Later on, such things appeared daily in the ?Tafhimul Qur?aan?.%0D%0A%0D%0ANow it has become known without doubt that his writings and publications are the greatest Fitnah of the present time, notwithstanding a few beneficial treatises that have appeared, it is the case of ?and the sin of them is greater than their usefulness.? (Surah Baqarah 219). Now that stage has been reached where to keep silent seems to be a great crime. It is regretted that for forty years an offensive silence was kept. Now the time has dawned, where without fear of rebuttal and censure all his writings from A to Z should be thoroughly studied with a view to fulfil the demands for the preservation of the Deen with Haqq and justice.%0D%0A%0D%0AWallaahu Waliyyut Tawfeeq%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad Yusuf Binnori"
