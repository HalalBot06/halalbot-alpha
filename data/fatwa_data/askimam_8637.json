  "question": "Salaah of a Musafir Muqtadi",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf the Muqtadi was a Musafir and he stopped at a Masjid on a highway where normal daily five prayers do not take place. Only travellers pray there. Please comment on each situation\n\n(1) If the Muqtadi saw a Jamaat taking place there & incorrectly thought that the person leading the Salaat is also a Musaafir. When the Imam completed the whole four Rakaats of Ishaa only then he realized his mistake. Would his Salaat still be invalid? (2) If under the same circumstances as above\n\n(1), the Muqtadi makes the intention of saying either 2 or 4 Rakaats according to what the Imam's intention is. Under this situation, would the Muqtadi's Salaat be valid, regardless of whether the Imam was a Musafir or a Muqeem?\n\n(3) If the Muqtadi (Musafir) saw a Jamaat & was not sure of the Niyaat of the Imam. Hence he made the intention of whatever the Imam's intention is. Would his Salaat be valid under this circumstance, regardless of whether the Imam was a Musafir or a Muqeem?\n\n(4) At times I have to rush home right after Farz Salaat from the Masjid to take care of domestic affairs. After sometime when I find time to complete my salaat (the usual Sunnat and Nafl Rakaaats which I would perform inside the Masjid), I become lazy and cannot really perform those Nafl Rakaats. If I am granted the Taufiq to perform those Nafl Rakaats or recite the Quran I do not really have the same enthusiasm as I would have inside the masjid. Would I be considered a Riyaa Kaar or a show-off?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1,2 & 3. In all three situations that you have stated, the Salaat of the Musaafir Muqtadi will be valid. (1. Bahrur Raaiq, Vol. 2, Page 135, Bahishti Zewar, Page 902 (Part 11), 2 & 3. Raddul Muhtaar, Vol. 1, Page 309)\n\n4. Being a show-off (riyaa kaar) depends on the intention of a person. If the intention is to show people, then it will be termed as riyaa, otherwise not. You should try to perform the Sunnah and Nafl Salaat at home with the same enthusiasm as you would do in a Masjid. If this is not possible then you should rather perform your Sunnah and Nafl Salaat in the Masjid before rushing home to care of your domestic affairs.\n\nAnd Allah Taala knows best,\n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf"
