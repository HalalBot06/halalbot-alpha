  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am thinking of doing nikah over telephone, my Insha'Allah going to be wife and her parents knows me very well. I would like to know that can i do nikah again when i personally go for marriage as i like to do the nikah again in mosque or the nikah that is done before is sufficient. Also tell me what should one do when someone is leading prayers and his ablution nullifies, if the imam goes for renewing his ablution then what will the muqtadi's do?. Can i use pins to hold the upper ihram from falling while performing umrah or hajj.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Nikah over the telephone is not correct as your presence in the same gathering is a condition. If Nikah is conducted once, then there is no need to conduct it again however it should be borne in mind that it is very important for your nikah to be announced and done publicly.\n\n2. If the Imaans wudhu breaks then he should appoint another person to take over the salah, however it will be better to stop the salah and restart it.\n\n3. It is mukruh to use pins to hold the ihram.
