  "question": "Is it allowed to marry a divorcee?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI want to know is it allowed in Islam for a man who is already married to marry another woman (she is not a divorcee , neither a widow)...he likes her , she likes him and they want to get married. Does shariah only allow a man to marry a divorcee or a widow or he can marry someone because he likes her and doesn't want to sin, so he wants to marry her? Is this allowed?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThere is no restriction in Shariah in choosing a marriage partner. A person may marry an unmarried women, divorcee, widow or whomsoever he wishes to marry. However, it is important that a man chooses a partner who is compatible with him.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
