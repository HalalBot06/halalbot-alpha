  "answer": "QUESTION\nin pakistan, we have a sect known as pervaizi who don't accept hadith as a source of islamic knowledge.. can this sect be regarded as muslims?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPrimarily, there are two types of Ahaadith; Mutawaatir and Ahad.\n\nMutawatir Ahaadith are narrated by innumerable number of narrators. It is\nimpossible that such a large number of people will unite on speaking a lie.\nIt is similar to a verse of the Qur'aan in its authenticity. To reject a\nHadith Mutawaatir is Kufr. To reject Hadith Aahaad (which has many branches\nin relation to the standard of its authenticity) is Fisq (transgression).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
