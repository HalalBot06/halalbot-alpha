  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1)my friend has told me it is sunnah to wear watch in right hand..is it true? 2)is it sunnah to wear the silver ring?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1. Ali رضى الله عنه narrates that Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم used to wear his ring on his right hand.\n\n \n\nعن علي بن أبي طالب : أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم كان يلبس خاتمه في يمينه\n\nالشمائل المحمدية للترمذي – ص 6 سعيد\n\nOther narrations suggest that Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم should wear his ring on his left hand. Imam Muslim narrates on the authority of Anas رضى الله عنه that Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم should wear his ring on his small finger of the left hand.\n\nأنس قال كان خاتم النبى -صلى الله عليه وسلم- فى هذه. وأشار إلى الخنصر من يده اليسرى.\n\n صحيح مسلم – 2/197رشيدية\n\nTherefore, one could wear his watch on whichever hand he wish to. According to our akabir (pious predecessors), it is advisable to wear the watch on the right hand as it is a means of observing salah times etc. Anything which is apparently good should be done from the right.\n\n2. Our illustrious Jurists mention that if there is no need to wear a ring, one should abstain from wearing it.\n\nقاضيخان 4/371 حقانية\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Ishaq E.
