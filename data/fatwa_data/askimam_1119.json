  "answer": "QUESTION\nI want to keep my daughter name is \"Juveria\". But I don't know what it means. Please can you help me. Remember in dua. Jazaka Allah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe name should be spelled and pronounced as Juwayriyya and not Juveria.\n\nJuwayriyya was also the name of one of the blessed wives of our beloved\nProphet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Juwayriyya is derived from the root\nword Jaar which means 'to pull'. It also means a small boat and a small\ngirl.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
