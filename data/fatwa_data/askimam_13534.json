  "question": "During the 5 days of Hajj, do I have to spend the whole night in Muzadalifa until Fajr the following morning",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy husband and I are going for Hajj at the end of this year, Insha Allah. I am Hanafi & he is Shaafi. During the 5 days of Hajj, do I have to spend the whole night in Muzadalifa until Fajr the following morning according to the Hanafi ruling, or can I move on to Mina after midnight like the Shaafis do. Shukran Salaams\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, there is concession for women, the elderly and the ill not to stay the entire night in Muzdalifah. If it is difficult for you to stay in Muzdalifah the entire night based on your husband being a Shafi and he does not want to stay the entire night in Muzdalifah then there is leeway for you to proceed to Mina with your husband after midnight as the Shafees do.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
