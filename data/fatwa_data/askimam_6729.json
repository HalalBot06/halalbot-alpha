  "question": "1. I realize that I recited Alhamdu surah alone and not an additional surah. 2. Which mad-hub follows in Masjid al-Haram and masjidun-nabawi?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. When I perform 4th raka'at of sunnah prayer, I release my hands and kept in sides. Then I realize that I recited Alhamdu surah alone and not an additional surah. Again I tied my hands and recited a surah and did Sajda-Sahu. Is it okay? If not ok how one should do at this situation 2. Which mad-hub follows in Masjid al-Haram and masjidun-nabawi? Is it okay to join with the Jama'at (for prayer) which leads by a Wahhabi?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If you left your hands on the sides after reciting Surah Faatiha and then\ntied them before reciting a Surah, then there is no need to make\nSajdah-e-Sahw.\n2. There are different Imaams in both Harams of Makkah Mukarramah and\nMadinah Munawwarah. To the best of our knowledge, they do not make Taqleed\nof any one specific Madhab. If our understanding is correct, then we\ndisagree with that as following one particular Imaam's Madhab is compulsory.\n3. What is your understanding of Wahhaabi?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
