  "question": "if my husband is allowed to spend time with his ex-wife without my knowledge and must he support her financially as he does support his children.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nif my husband is allowed to spend time with his ex-wife without my knowledge and must he support her financially as he does support his children.\n\nShe continuously makes demands which he always fulfill so that he does not make her angry. He lies to me alot about her, and never tells me the truth. He says that I cant go with him to her when he picks up his kids as she will get angry with him even if I sit in car outside of her house.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe apologise for the delay in responding.\n\nIt is not permissible for your husband to have any contact with his ex wife. She is considered as a stranger to him. He is not obliged to support her as well. According to Shariah a husband will only support his divorced wife during the Iddah (waiting period). However, he will be responsible to support his children at all times.\n\nWe suggest that you talk to him and explain him the seriousness of his actions. Show him more love and compassion and seize the correct time when he will listen to you. Ask him for time where you could pour the sentiments of your heart out to him. End of the day he is your husband and you share one bed. There must be a time when he will melt and listen to you. However, if this does not yield any benefit, you could involve the seniors of the family or some influential people in whom you and your husband have confidence and request them to assist you in your predicament. It is possible that the love for his ex wife is still within him. This is the plight that he could be faced with. Assist him to overcome this difficulty and your problem could be solved. Alternatively he could seek counseling and overcome this predicament of his.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
