  "answer": "QUESTION\nAre we allowed to miss salaat with Jamaat in the masjid if we have important exams (as far as the world is concerned) scheduled for the next day?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe reading of Salaat with Jamat is very important. Some jurists say it is Waajib and some say Sunnat-e-Muakkadah.%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), on numerous occasions stressed on the importance of Jamaat Salaat. On one occasion, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Salaat with Jamaat is 25 times superior that Salaat read alone.? Also by Muslims meeting 5 times a day, it creates love and unity. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?When a person makes Wudhu and leaves to read Salaat with Jamaat in the Musjid, for every step he takes, his status will be raised and one sin will be decreased.? Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) also said, ?I would like to tell a group of youngsters to gather firewood and go around to all those people who are reading Salaat without Jamat and burn their homes.? From here, we can see the importance of Salaat with Jamaat.%0D%0A%0D%0AInsha Allah, if you take out time from your studies and go for Salaat with Jamat, Allah will make you successful in your exams.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
