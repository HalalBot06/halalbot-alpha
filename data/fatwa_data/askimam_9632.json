  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy husband and I have a 5 year son. We have been trying to conceive another child for about 4 years. They have found no problem with either of us. I also underwent IVF with my husbands sperm but this did not yeild any positive results. However during the IVF I got really sick with pretty unusal symptons. My doctor said she had not seen any such cases and extensive reading on the internet did not show any similar case. We believe we are under the influence of magic by my husbands sister in law. However we have no evidence only suspicion. His sister in law is barren for 18 years. She never got her periods but this was kept a secret from my husbands brother (her husband) and his family. This women wanted her sister to marry my husband before we got married. Our first child was conceived and born before we met this women. She is in Pakistan and we are in the USA. Please assist with any specific duas to enable us have another baby and also how we may find out if our suspicions are trua. If that is the case how can the magic be reversed.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou may recite the following Du?aa, ?Rabbi hab liy min ladunka dhurriyyatan tayyiba?.\n\nAlso, we should refrain from harbouring any bad thoughts regarding anyone, more especially, if this is pure speculation and without proof. Allah Ta?ala states, ?O you who believe! Avoid much suspicions, indeed some suspicions are sins. And spy not, neither backbite one another. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother?? you would hate it (so hate backbiting), and fear Allah, verily, Allah is the one who accepts repentance, most Merciful.? (al-Hujuraat vol.12 part26)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
