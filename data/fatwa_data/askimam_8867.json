  "question": "How to clean up car contaminated with dog carcass. If we drove over a dog carcass, how should we clean up?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf our pants touched the car wheels before we clean the car, should we wash the pants? What if the pants have touched other things(eg. the car seat),should we wash them too? (The dog carcass was broken to pieces due to road accident. )\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The washing of the wheels of the car is sufficient to clean the wheels\nfrom the impurities of the dog.\n2. If the pants touched the carcass of the dog and no impurities of the dog\ncame on the pants, the pants will be pure. There is no need to wash the car\nseat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
