  "question": "Is it permissable for a muslim doctor to perform post-mortems to earn a living? will this be regarded as a halaal source of income? please clarify.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe human body is sacred and cutting it is contrary to its sanctity. In addition to the cutting and mutilation of the body, a post-mortem also results in the private parts of a human being, albeit a dead one, being exposed, which is a shameless act.\n\nOn account of legal requirements, Muslims are compelled to undergo post-mortems and in light of the fact that it is a legal requirement, there could be some leeway for a doctor to perform a post-mortem, especially if he will be able to aid in the quick release of the body and minimise mutilation to the corpse.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
