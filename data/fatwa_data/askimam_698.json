  "question": "Is working for a financial institute haraam or does the law of necessity apply in South Africa and therefore dependant on the situation?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have been working for a fin institute for 2 years and have always regarded my earnings to lack barakah and blessings. I have opted to become a contractor in my current position i.e. I have signed a contract with a recruitment agency who in turn signs a contract with the fin institute to employ me for a year. My salary is thus paid by the recruitment agent. Does this make it halaal or was it halaal to begin with due to the law of necessity. I work in the computer field which has a greater percentage of jobs in the financial institutes due to technology used.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nGenerally, the major source of income of conventional financial institutes is interest and other un-Islamic avenues. Therefore, in principle it is not permissible to be employed by such institutes as the major portion of salaries will be from interest and un-Islamic avenues.\n\nHowever, if one has to support his dependants and does not have an alternate adequate income, he may continue his employment and search for an adequate\nHalaal alternative.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
