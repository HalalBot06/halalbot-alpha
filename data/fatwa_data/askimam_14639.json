  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalaamualikum.\n\nMoulana plse could you advise me re Nikkah. i was was once told that it is advisable to first marry within your family, then outside... sticking as far as possible within your culture & ofcourse within your religion, for compatibilty reasons.\n\nis there any truth in this?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nCompatibility in marriage is of paramount importance for a stable marriage, there are different angles of compatibility. One angle is compatibility in family. In this angle it is not always necessary that the spouses are compatible in their natures. It is often noticed that 2 persons from one family have completely opposite natures. Therefore, the laws of compatibility in marriage should be on the nature of the spouses, even though they may be out of ones family and culture. If the spouses are from one family and culture, and also compatible in nature, then that is ideal.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
