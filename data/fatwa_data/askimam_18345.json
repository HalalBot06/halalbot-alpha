Please help. may Allah reward you\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nKindly find the attached article regarding the usage of temporary and permanent contraceptives.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa\n\n\n\n\nCONTRACEPTION\n\nContraception is permissible on a limited scale for valid reasons - reasons considered by the Shariah to be valid. The circumstances which will permit reversible and permanent contraception differ.\n\nREVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTION\n\nAmong the reasons accepted by the Shariah as valid for practicing reversible contraception are:\n\n(A) Physical weakness.\n\n(B) Sickness.\n\n(C) The wife maintaining her beauty or figure for the sake of her husband.\n\n(D) The couple being on a journey or in a distant land.\n\n(E) Adverse political conditions, e.g. children are forcibly separated from their parents as is advocated by communism; etc.\n\n(F) The couple decides to separate in the near future.\n\n(G) The wife is an immoral person.\n\nThere are valid grounds for practicing reversible contraception. Poverty or the fear of poverty are not valid reasons for contraception. It is not permissible to practice contraception on account of a fear of not being able to provide for a large family. Such a fear is an attribute of non-Muslims. According to the Quran Shareef: 'There is no living creature, but its sustenance is the responsibility of Allah.'\n\nSimilarly desire to curb sexual desire which may stem out of piety is not a lawful ground for contraception. If practiced for any reason which is unlawful in Islam, then contraception will likewise be unlawful, e.g. for indulgence in illicit sex.\n\nPERMANENT CONTRACEPTION\n\nPermanent contraception is permissible only if the woman's life is in danger or her health is seriously threatened.\n\nTherefore, it will not be permissible for you to use permanent contraceptives. However, you may use temporary contraceptives."
