Should I request that guy to accept islam because that's the only way left with me. Please answer with reference as your answer wil determine where my life goes.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nAlhamdulillahi Mashallah, it gives us extreme delight to receive your email. We commend you greatly for your wonderful and correct choice of selecting Islam, the perfect way of life, as your guide through this dark world and your ticket to eternal bliss in the life to come (hereafter). May Allah increase our level of belief and conviction in Him at every moment, Ameen.\n\nIslam, by nature is more than just a Religion rather; it is a way of life providing guidance in all aspects of one’s life. Islam promotes kindness, compassion to all, Allah consciousness, and discourages any sort of harmful and evil practices. It is due to this beauty in its teachings that Islam has always had a natural magnetic pull to all people irrespective of their ethnic background, creed, race or nationality; you may have realized this in your secretive study of Islam and study of those who have embraced it. Once a person realises the clearness, transparency and logic in its beliefs, mainly the belief in there being only One God, Allah, some people make their belief public whilst others for various legitimate reasons conceal it. In fact, even the maternal uncle of our beloved Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) embraced Islam (secretly, only telling the Prophet of Allah) about 7 years prior to making his choice public; due to legitimate reasons. In the interim, he nonetheless, continued to practice on Islam secretively and was firm on it. What is required of you now is also to remain firm on Islam and its practices.\n\n(Ma’ariful Quran of Mufti Shafee Sahb Vol. 4, Pg. 283)\n\nOnce, a Sahabi, a companion approached our beloved Rasul (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) and requested, “Please tell me something so comprehensive about Islam that I need not ask anyone anything after you.” Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) replied, “Say, I believe in Allah. Then, stand firm (remain steadfast) on it (Islam and its dictates).”\n\nThe Sahabah (Radiyallahu Anhum) because of this, would give priority to their Deen over anything else; as in your case, where you have stood firm and correctly told your parents that you cannot marry the Hindu man. In fact, marrying a Hindu is not merely Haram, it would even cast one out if the fold of Islam.\n\n( http://www.askimam.org/fatwa/fatwa.php?askid=d6ce37e31b7a093fbdd8afb81e6650f0 )\n\nHence, not wanting to offend Allah by marring the Hindu and, not wanting to offend your parents, more so, when being the elder in the family is surely sensible thinking. You have realized that your rights to Allah are more important and you cannot sacrifice this.\n\nAs you have suggested, you could request the person to accept Islam. Present to him the beauty of Islam through which you were personally inspired to accept it and, communicate to him the other pearls of Islam that you studied. This may seemingly be tough but remember that Hidayat (Guidance to choose Islam) is only from Allah; so together your mortal communication, you will have to create a Divine communication as well, by begging earnestly to Allah (engage in Dua) for Allah alone can make this a reality. Remember, if the person accepts Islam, you would have achieved even more, in that you will be saving yourself and another person from the consequences of not accepting belief in One Divine Allah and the other requirements. Explain to him the simple, easy and logical beliefs and practices of Islam. He will Inshallah be touched by this. We will certainly make Dua for you that you succeed. As an alternative, using your discretion, you could even consider talking to the boy’s parents and family and explain to them that you are a Muslim.\n\nAllah make your task an easy one. We will certainly be in our Duas. Please feel free to contact the Darul Iftaa at anytime.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
