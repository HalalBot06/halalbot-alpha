  "question": "Rent commission on lease referral",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAA Mufti Sb 1] If the apartment complex we live in has a referral scheme in which if I (who is a current tenant ) refer some one else , then if that person signs the lease , I get half a months rent credit. My first question is that whether this money is halaal ? 2] My second question is - Someone approached me and told me that if he while signing the lease would mention my name , the credit I would get - I give it to him. I said yes to him without thinking much. Later I thought that it will be fair to share the money and went back to him ( after he had already signed the lease) asking whether we share the money. He seemed to agree to this option. My question is - does this qualify as breaking the promise if he now agrees to share the money? If it doesn't qualify as breaking the promise, then can I keep half of the money ? Please kindly answer the 3 questions I had above. May Allah reward you Allah Hafiz\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is permissible to accept this credit.\n\n2. If he freely, without pressure, agreed to share the money, then it would not be counted as you have broken your promise. Rather, he has absolved you of your promise.\n\n3. You may keep half the money.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
