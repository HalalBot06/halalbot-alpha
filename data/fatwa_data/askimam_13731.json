If you are a Saahib-e-Nisaab, then you will have to perform your Eid Qurbaani. That could be done in Makkah Mukarramah or in Pakistan.\n\nSince you will be doing Tamattu Hajj, you will have to make Damm-e-Shukr. Slaughter a goat or sheep or 1/7 of a camel in the Haram. If you cannot do this, you must keep ten fasts. At least, three of the fasts should be before the 10th of Dhul Hijjah. The remaining 7 could be anytime thereafter.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
