  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaam Aleikum dear Mufti. Please give fatwa on the following: Is it permissbale to have two pieces of najaz on differrent parts of clothes during salaat?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf there are two pieces of Najis on different parts of the clothes, but when one adds the two together it is more than the hollow of the palm, then Salaat is not valid.\n\nIf it is less that the hollow of the palm, the Salaat will be valid, but will be Makrooh.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
