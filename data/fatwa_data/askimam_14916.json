People ask many questions about Rasulullah (S.A.W.)’s marriages in general and in particular his marriage to Aysha (R.A.). These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere on this site.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nA Female Iftaa Student\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
