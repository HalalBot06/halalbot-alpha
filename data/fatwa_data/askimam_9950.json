  "question": "What do I tell a non-muslim who has told me that Islam is outdated?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe suggest firstly that you determine whether the non-Muslim made this statement as a criticism or merely as a personal opinion based upon misinformation gleaned from the media and other sources.\n\nIn the case of the former, the best is silence if you feel that no amount of convincing proofs will get you anywhere. In the case of the latter, ascertain which part of Islam he is referring to and respond accordingly.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
