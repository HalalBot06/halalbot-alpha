  "question": "I am from the Hanafi Madhab and I wanted to know how me and a muslim girl can engage in Nikah. What is the proper procedure?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam U Alayqum brother. I am a 20 year old boy and I want to engage in a Nikah with an 18 year old girl who is muslim and like me she also follows the Hanafi Madhab. By the questions posted on the website we know that a Nikah is valid without our parents concent. But there is nothing there that tells us how the actual process can be carried out. We already know we need 2 male witnesses. Can you please tell us what else we need to do. How do I propose, how does she accept, what documents are needed and what do these documents include? I know the answer to my question could be very lengthy so if you can tell me about a website that can answer my question that would be great. If not I would be very thankful if you posetd the answer to my question on your website. Jazakallah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) The nikah can be simply performed. If there is a trusworthy Aalim in your\ncommunity, approach him and explain the situation. He can conduct the nikah\nin privacy, in the presence of two witnesses.\n2) If this is not possible, get the help of two Muslim males to stand as\nwitness. Take them home, in in their presence address your future wife with\nthese words: \"I present myself to you in Nikah. Do you accept\". If she\nreplies: \"I accept\", the nikah will be valid. It is not necessary to put the\nNikah down in writing, but it would be better to do so.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
