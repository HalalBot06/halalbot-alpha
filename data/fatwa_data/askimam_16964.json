  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSometimes we buy product from a store e.g. at a price of 20 and after sometime the same product reduced to 10. Is it allowed to to refund or exchange the product that we bought (i.e. still new) in 20 to save the difference of 10. And then buy it again for 10.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nAs a principle it will be permissible to return the item you purchased at 20 if the seller agrees. You are then at liberty to purchase the item again at 10.However to conduct oneself with such selfishness in our transactions is unethical.       (Al Mausoo atul Fiqhiyah V4 Baabul Iqaalah)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
