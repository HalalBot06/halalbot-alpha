  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI was asked by one of my collegues who is a non muslim the following question : Allah is omniscient so he knows what has happened and what is going to happen. Allah has given all the human beings free will that is he has given them a choice of selection. Both of them seem to be contradictory statements. How do u justify them?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nBoth the beliefs as mentioned by you are correct. Allah knows what has happened and what will happen in future as the knowledge of Allah is absolute. He even knows what every individual will do out of his own choice.\n\nThe choice of an individual is not contrary to the absolute knowledge of Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
