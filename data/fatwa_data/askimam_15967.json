However, when she leaves home or the women’s gathering, she should cover herself with a simple outer garment (jilbaab) and she should also cover her face. The purpose of covering herself and her face is to conceal her beauty, form and shape.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
