  "question": "Is Qibla direction from USA northeast or southeast?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs Qibla direction from USA northeast or southeast? an issue that has been grappling the muslims of north america is the Qibla. Now those that say its Southeast say is because the Qu'ran says simply to turn opposite..and which the sahabas did a well....which was just turn opposite..this is true if the world is flat. Those that make the case for northeast state that the world is round and if makkah is the center of the earth, the obvious qibla becomes Northeast from places like new york city and so forth. Second question is what about the Masjids that have been already been built facing a specific way and its suppose to be the other way? I really appreciate your response jazak allah masalaama\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nBased on our research, the direction of Qibla in North America is in a North%0D%0AEasterly direction. This is based on the fact that the earth is spherical in%0D%0Ashape and by facing in the North Easterly direction it would be the shortest%0D%0Adistance between him and Makkah.%0D%0A%0D%0AFind hereunder a reply to a similar question.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta%E3la Knows Best.%0D%0A%0D%0AWas salaam%0D%0A%0D%0AYours faithfully%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A13 August, 1996%0D%0A28 Rabi ul Awwal, 1417%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Moulana A. S. Desai Saheb %0D%0A'By Fax' (041)413566%0D%0AMujlisul Ulama of SA%0D%0APORT ELIZABETH%0D%0A%0D%0ARespected Moulana Saheb%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0AQibla in America%0D%0AAfter extensive research in the direction of the Qibla in America, it is the%0D%0Aview of this humble servant of Islam that the Qibla direction in America is%0D%0ANorth East and not South East as pointed out in your fax of 95%2F05%2F07 and the%0D%0Alast issue of \"The Majlis\".%0D%0A%0D%0ADirection is determined by using the North Pole as the focal point. The%0D%0ANorth Pole is the center of direction and it is used as a reference in order%0D%0Ato relate direction. However, in order to determine the direction of the%0D%0AKa'bah, there will be a drastic change between the earth being a surface and%0D%0Athe earth being spherical and oblate. Consider the following illustration of%0D%0Aan orange peel. When a visible mark is made on the orange peel and the%0D%0Aorange is carefully peeled and flattened, the mark will not remain at the%0D%0Asame point. The earth is a sphere and expressing directions of this sphere%0D%0Aas a surface creates great distortions. In short distances, this may be%0D%0Ainsignificant but in long distances it will matter. Our concern here is the%0D%0Adirection of facing Makkah and not the direction one would take to reach%0D%0AMakkah. Whilst the direction to reach Makkah may be many but the direction%0D%0Aof facing Makkah from any point will only be one. Not withstanding the%0D%0Aarguments of the modernists in their decision, the underlying principle of%0D%0Athe Fuqahaa (for those who cannot see the Ka'bah) is to face the direction%0D%0Aof the Ka'bah. The direction of travelling (i.e. shortest route along the%0D%0Agreat circles) undoubtedly cannot be a blanket rule in determining the%0D%0Adirection of the Ka'bah due to the constant change of directions.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is not necessary that the great circle route will always (NOT) be the%0D%0Adirection of facing your destination neither will the rhumb line route%0D%0Aalways be the method of facing your destination. However, the rising and%0D%0Asetting of the sun will determine East and West, and the movement of the sun%0D%0Ais according to the spherical shape of the earth. Therefore, when%0D%0Adetermining direction on earth, the spherical shape of the earth cannot be%0D%0Aignored.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf the earth is regarded to be a surface in determining the Qibla, then the%0D%0Avarying degrees of the movement of the sun in different seasons would not%0D%0Ahave been decisive in ascertaining the direction of Qibla. This itself is%0D%0Aindicative in considering the oblate sphere of the earth in determining the%0D%0AQibla. Similarly, the North and South will be determined according to the%0D%0Aspherical shape of the earth - and not just any North or South. (Ref. 1%0D%0AJawaahirul Fiqh pg. 236 also see illustration on pg. 280 and 296, Ref. 2%0D%0AIrshaadul Aabid, Ahsanul Fataawa, Vol. 2). In the light of the above%0D%0Aexplanation, my suggestion would be that the direction of facing Makkah from%0D%0AAmerica would be North East and not South East. If a person faces in the%0D%0ASouth East direction, according to the spherical shape of the earth, he will%0D%0Anot face Makkah. On the other hand, if he faces North East he will%0D%0Adefinitely be facing Makkah.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is not necessary that by regarding the earth as a globe there will be two%0D%0AQibla's. Makkah is 21o North of Equator. In a case when a person travels 21o%0D%0AWest of Makkah and halts in the Pacific opposite Makkah, although there will%0D%0Abe two routes to reach Makkah (the Westerly and Easterly), but, the question%0D%0Ahere is facing Makkah and not reaching Makkah. Furthermore, if it is assumed%0D%0Athat a person is on the North Pole then the direction of Qibla will not be%0D%0Atoward all directions that are equidistant of Makkah. The question is not of%0D%0Adistance but it is of direction of facing Makkah. In such a situation the%0D%0AQibla from the North pole would be South along the longitude of 39o50'. It%0D%0Awill not be in all directions.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe quotations of geographers mentioned in your article is in conflict with%0D%0Athe views of local geographers and land surveyors. Therefore, the matter is%0D%0Aof dispute between themselves. Find attached some information from Chief%0D%0ADirectorate: Surveys and Land Information.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Mufti Rashid Saheb is also of the opinion that the Qibla in America%0D%0Ais in the N. Easterly direction. Ahsanul Fatwa Volume 2 Pages 313, 314, 315,%0D%0A316 and 317).%0D%0A%0D%0AWas salaam%0D%0A%0D%0AYours faithfully%0D%0A%0D%0A(Signed)%0D%0AMufti E. Desai%0D%0AMl. Y.
