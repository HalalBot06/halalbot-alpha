  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1)  Is it true the Khalid Bin Waleed (RA) kept a hair of the prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in his hat, and that at one time he had lost his hat and he started to worry until he found the hat. Isn't this relying on the Prophets hair and not relying on Allah (swt).\n\n 2)  Does Eid-ul Adha have to be the next day after Hajj, as one maulvi said that it does not have to be and that you can celebrate eid 2 days after Hajj.\n\n3)  Saudi Arabia started fast on Tuesday as did the majority of mosques in England, however the Barelvi's in our community started on Wednesday, Is it permissable for me to start the fast on Wednesday, as the people in my community did and this would also be good for the unity of our community.\n\n4) Did the prophet (PBUH) see Allah when he went on Meraj, and did he do the journey physically or was it a dream. What is the view of Ahle-Sunnat-Wal-Jamaat.\n\n5) I am doing Qazaa for my missed Farz. I do the following Niyaat,\n\nI am praying 85th Qazaa for my 2 rakaat  farz fajr, is this the correct way. Also when I have finished 360 (one year) I start from 1 qazaa again for the next year, is this correct or do I have to do niyaat for 361, 362 and so on. If this is wrong, would I have to repeat all the Qazaa that I have done.\n\n6)  If the imam has started Fajr  salaat, do I join the imam, or do I first read the 2 sunnat rakaats.\n\n7)  What do you read in the DUA when a muslim dies.\n\n8) Could you recommend me a good book in English on Tawheed. \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. This incident has been recorded by several Muhadditheen, viz. Imaams al-Tabrani [ra], al-Haakim [ra], Abu Nu’aym [ra] and Abu Ya’laa [ra]. Hafiz Haythami [ra] states that all the narrators are reliable and authentic. (Majmauz-zawaaid vol.9 pg.349). Such incidents are not rare among the Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhu]. In fact, Allah Ta’ala has recorded the incident of Sayyiduna Yusuf (alayhimus salaam) in the noble Qur’aan in which the mention of Sayyiduna Ya’coob (alayhimus salaam’s sight being restored through the shirt of Sayyiduna Yusuf (alayhimus salaam)is mentioned. Obviously, it is only Allah that causes such effects in these items, and for one to believe otherwise is extremely detrimental for one’s Imaan.\n\n2. Eidul Adha can be observed on the 10th, 11th, and 12th of Dhul Hijjah. This is reported from several Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhum] and Khulafaa-e-Raashideen (see al-Muwatta of Imaam Maalik; also refer to al-Istizkar of ibn Abdil-Barr vol.4 pg.246). Note: The Salaat should not be unnecessarily delayed. However, if it is delayed, it could only be performed upto the time of Zawaal on the 12th of Dhul Hijjah. (Tahtawi pg.538)\n\n3. Generally, those around you will not be aware of your fast as fasting is an act that is naturally concealed.\n\n4. The belief of the Ahlus sunnah is that Me’raaj (ascension) to the heavens took place with the physical self of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. (Aqidah Tahawiyyah pg.75; Maidani).\n\n5. The manner you have implemented is fine.
