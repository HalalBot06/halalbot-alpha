  "question": "Who are the Khawarij and who are the Wahabis?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease state any Ahadith regarding these.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Khawarij%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Khawarij - people described as overtly pious, having impressions of%0D%0Aprayer on their knees, palms and forheads - initially had three grievances%0D%0Aagainst 'Ali.%0D%0A%0D%0A1. 'Ali had submitted to the arbitration of men when reaching a political%0D%0Astalemate with Amir Mu'awiyah at Siffin whereas Allah said: \"Judgment lies%0D%0Aonly with Allah.\"%0D%0A2. In the battle of Jamal, 'Ali did not seize any booty nor captured any%0D%0Aslaves. If the party of 'A'ishah were Believers, it was permissible to%0D%0Aengage them in battle in the first place. If they were non-Believers, it was%0D%0Apermissible to seize their possessions and capture their men.%0D%0A3. 'Ali resigned his position as the Commander of the Faithful. The Khawarij%0D%0Apromised to retract from their views if 'Ali convinced them as to the%0D%0Afallacy of their arguments in the light of the Qur'an and the Prophet%0D%0Atraditions.%0D%0A%0D%0A'Ali replied in the following way:%0D%0A1. \"Regarding your saying \"A man has arbitrated in the matter of Allah,\"%0D%0AAllah says in the Qur'an: \"O you who believe, do not hunt while in a state%0D%0Aof ritual consecration (Hurum). Whoever intentionally hunts amongst you, on%0D%0Ahim is a recompense similar to that on sheep to be judged by two just people%0D%0Aamongst you.\" Allah says regarding a husband and his wife: \"If you fear%0D%0Aseparation betwee them, appoint an arbitrator from his side and her side.\"%0D%0AIn these two cases, Allah had left the matter in the hands of people. I take%0D%0Aan oath of Allah before you, Is not the arbitration in the matter of blood%0D%0Abetween Muslims better than arbitration between a husband and a wife or%0D%0Aregarding a hunted rabbit whose price does not exceed four dirhams.\" They%0D%0Areplied: \"Surely, this matter is superior.\"%0D%0A2. 'Ali continued: \" Regarding your saying \"You fought them, but did not%0D%0Aseize their booty nor captivatred them,\" can you capture your Mother%0D%0A'A'ishah? If you say that she can be captured and treated like any of the%0D%0Aother female slaves, you have surely comitted infidelity. If you say that%0D%0Ashe is not our mother than you have also comitted infidelity. You are thus%0D%0Ahovering between two deviaions.\"%0D%0A3. Addressing the third query, 'Ali answered: \"Regarding your saying that I%0D%0Aobliterated my name as the Commander of the Faithful, I was present on the%0D%0Aday of Hudaybiyyah when the treaty was being drafted. The Holy Prophet said:%0D%0A\"Write O 'Ali, this is what has been agreed upon by Muhammad, the Messenger%0D%0Aof Allah.\" Abu Sufyan and Suahil ibn 'Amr objected to this saying: \"We do%0D%0Anot know that you are the Messenger of Allah. If we knew that you were the%0D%0AMessenger of Allah, we would not have opposed you.\" Upon this, the Holy%0D%0AProphet said: \"O Lord, you know that I am your Messenger. O 'Ali, write:%0D%0A\"This is what Muhammad ibn 'Abdullah and Abu Sufyan and Suhail ibn 'Amr has%0D%0Aagreed upon.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AAfter this, 2000 of the Khawarij changed their position and the rest of them%0D%0Astill opposed 'Ali.%0D%0A%0D%0AKhalid Dhorat%0D%0A%0D%0A"
