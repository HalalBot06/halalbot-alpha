  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI live in germany and I have a problem. I know i musnt kill people but I did in games. Is it allowed?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nThe concept of video games has no worldly or religious benefit. Rather, such games are harmful to ones mental and physical health. Also, hours at a time are wasted in playing video games so much so that even the prayers are missed.  Therefore, it will not be permissible to play video games, especially, of this kind.\n\n(Al-MAhmood, 74, Darul Ifta, )\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
