  "question": "My boyfriend is scared of tellin his parents abt us coz he is surtie and im memon. his parents might not accept me. any dua that i can read so that they approve of us geting married?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDu?aa, in essence, refers to that which emanates from the heart. Hence, one may ask from the bottom of his heart in whichever language he may desire. Allah Ta?ala, who is the fulfiller of all needs, is All-Hearing and All-Understanding. However, you may read the Du?aa, ?Rabb Inniy lima anzalta ilayya min khayrin faqeer?. Also, recite Salaatul Haajat and make Istikhaara.\n\nWe would like to emphasise that boyfriend/girlfriend relationship is totally un-Islamic and is nothing but Zina (adultery). Hence, we advise that all the relevant parties meet as soon as possible and get the marriage done.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
