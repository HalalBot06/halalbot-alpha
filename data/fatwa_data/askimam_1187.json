  "question": "Where in koran does it say that boyfriend-girlfriend relationship is forbidden,including that they do nothing wrong?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n.I mean by nothing wrong that there is no kind of any contact like sex or even holding hands,not even love words.By the way I asked this question to a sheikh and he told me \"verse 25,in surat elnessaa\"I read its tafseer and it means\"adultry in public or in secret\" please tell me something else from koran not from hadith.Thank you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nConsider the following injunctions of the noble Qur'aan:\n1. Lowering the gaze\n2. Hijaab\n3. Women staying in the confines of her home\n4. Prohibiting women speaking in an alluring tone\n\nThe above injunctions from the noble Qur'aan are sufficient to explain the prohibition of boyfriend/girlfriend relationship.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
