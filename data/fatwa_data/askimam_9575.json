  "answer": "QUESTION\nTwo weeks ago, i dreamt i was reading namaaz in madina and then went to the roza mubarak and kissed it.. What does this mean??? 2. A friend of mines has been having repeated dreams about snakes and someone strangling her, and then when she woke up, the very same person smsed her on her cellphone, and she is really freaking out. Does this have any meaning... and what must she do??\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Alhamdulillah, that is a very Mubaarak and blessed dream. You should endervour to follow the Sunnats as much as possible and also increase your Durood (salaat/Salaam) upon Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\n2. Your friend should ignore the dream. The Shaytaan is trying its deceptive ways and methods of creating worry and fear in your friend?s heart. Advise your friend to give some Sadaqaat and not to worry.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
