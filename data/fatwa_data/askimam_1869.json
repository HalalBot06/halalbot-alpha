  "question": "Why was the Prophet's (s.a.w) heart taken out by angels before going to Isra and a part taken out refered to as that of satans? I do not understand this when Prophet's are said to be masoom.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe incident of removing the heart and washing it should be understood in\nthe context of Isra (physical ascension to the skies).\n\nIt was a journey to a pure and sacred place filled with spirituality. The\nheart had to be prepared accordingly for such a journey. Just as taking a\nbath and preparing, for example, for Jummu'ah does not affect the Ismat of\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), so too, the washing of the heart\nfrom any possible contamination does not affect the Ismat as well.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
