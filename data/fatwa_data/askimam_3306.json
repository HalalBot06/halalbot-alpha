  "question": "Do we say Prophets were sinless?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have heard people disagreeing. What is the truth? JazkAllah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAll the scholars, of Ilmul Kalaam (experts in the field of Aqaaid and\nbeliefs) are unanimous that every prophet was free from Shirk (ascribing\npartnership with Allah), Kufr (disbelief) and sins. (Shahul Aqaaid)\n\nAllah Ta'ala has mentioned incidents of some prophets who were rebuked by\nAllah for making decisions that were not contextually appropriate (judgment\nby error). That is not a sin. However, due to their lofty status in the\nsight of Allah Ta'ala, they were rebuked. An example of that is Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) granting freedom to the captives of the battle\nof Badr. Allah Ta'ala rebuked Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) for\nthat. Granting freedom to captives was not a sin but an error in judgment.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
