  "question": "Can we in anyway Call the Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) Alive?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSince we know that Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) receives and answers the salutations of His Ummah , and that He also gets provisions , so can we in anyway call Him alive? Jazak-Allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHaazir (Omnipresent) and Naazir (Omniseeing) are the sole attributes of\nAllah.\n\nNo human being including our Nabiy (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) can be\nHaazir and Naazir. Our beloved Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is\nresting in Madinah Munawwarah. He informed us that when anyone sends Salaams\nto him, the angels convey the Salaam to him there.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
