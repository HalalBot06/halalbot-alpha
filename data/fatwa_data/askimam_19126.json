  "question": "Is it a sin to make an unintentional mistake while reading the Quran?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhenever I read Quran, I try my best not to make any mistakes. Arabic is not my native language and I am (still) learning to read Quran. If I make (unintentional) mistake while reading Quran, will it be considered a sin?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nMay Allah reward you for learning to read the Quran.\n\nYou will get double the reward for continuing to improve your recitation and trying to do your best to pronounce the words correctly. [i]\n\nTo prevent mistakes, it would be best for you to approach a teacher in your locality who is proficient in reading the Quran, and can assist you in learning tajweed.\n\nYou should also listen to tilaawah (recitation) of the Quran on tapes or CDs to increase your familiarity with how the words are pronounced.\n\n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMl.
