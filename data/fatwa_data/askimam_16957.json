  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have 2 questions about Zakaat. One is that jewellery that I am saving for my daughters 5 tolas for each of them. Should I pay Zakaat on that? They are young so I cannot hand that over to them until they will be grown ups. Second question is that I have a plot that my father has given me as gift. I want to make a house on that in the future. Should I pay Zakaat on that.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1.      There are two situations pertaining to Zakat on the jewellery.\n\na.       If the jewellery belongs to you and you have not given the jewellery to your daughters, then you are liable for the Zakat on the jewellery as you are the owner.\n\nb.      If you have given the jewellery to your daughters or the jewellery does belong to them and you are looking after their jewellery, then there is no Zakat on the jewellery, if your daughters are minors. If your daughters are adult, that is they have attained puberty or is 15 years of age, then they are adults and Zakat of the jewellery will be compulsory on them.\n\n2.      There is no Zakat on the plot.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
