  "question": "They are ready to give her in marriage to me but they don't want her to relocate immediately with me unless I agree to provide her with university education over here",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat should I do in the following case: I am going to be 25 this year and my mom has chosen her niece for me as potential bride and she told me that this is one of hes dreams . Alumdulillah the bride is very religious, regular in prayer, persistent in wearing hijab and obedient to elder's and very modest. I think it could be great for me. But, I have some problems. The girl wants to to become a medical professional. It will take me 7 more years of waiting. I am working overseas and the environment here is very tough to lower down my gaze . Moreover, I don't think the wanton display in the universities here and inetrmingling is good for the muslims. Ofcourse, for practsing muslimah it's the toughest as they are the target of non-muslim males as the practising muslimah's are perfectly fresh . Moreover, after the recent incidents, in our locality a lot of muslimah lost their honor in the hand of non-muslim males. So, I don't think it's a good environment for her to pursue an undergraduate degree. But, then even if she pursue any other degree other than madicine in back home, I have to wait 6 more years atleast. The girl along with her mother is very persistent in her ambition of becoming a doctor. They are ready to give her in marriage to me but they don't want her to relocate immediately with me unless I agree to provide her with university education over here. What do you suggest me to do in this situation.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt all depends on how you feel about her. If you really want to marry her,\nyou should try to convince her family not to send her to such an un-Islamic\nenvironment and that you are not prepared to wait for such a long period of\ntime.\n\nIt seems that they want to rule the 'marriage' from now already, what do you\nthink it would be like after you marry? Why don't you look for another pious\nwoman who doesn't cherish such ambitions.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
