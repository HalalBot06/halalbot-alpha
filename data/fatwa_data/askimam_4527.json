  "question": "My friend's husband has been having open and flagerant adulturous relationship with another married woman for more than a year.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHe openly admits to it, and had refused to stop. My friend finally kicked him out of the house three months ago. She does not want to go thru the court for immediate divorce since it requires reliving the experience thru testimonies, etc.. So, she is going thru the no fault divorce. In this state, the husband can take upto two years to sign the papers. Then 90 days must elapse until the divorce is final. Under Allah's law and in his site is she still considered married to him? Thank you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn order for a divorce to take place, the husband must issue divorce to his\nwife. This could be\nby saying the words divorce or writing it down. The wife throwing the\nhusband out of the house does not constitute a divorce.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
