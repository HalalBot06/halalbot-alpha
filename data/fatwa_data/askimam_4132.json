  "answer": "QUESTION\nBissmilla ir Rehmaan er Raheem, Assalaam o alaikum I was told by my parents that we are from the sons (lineage) of sayidena Ali(ra), from sayidena Abbas(ra). It is clear that we are not sayed, because we are not from sayidena Fatima(ra) [but another wife of sayidena Ali(ra)]. In Pakistan our clan/tribe (qawm) is known as Awan. I would like to know is there any way to substantiate (prove) this? If this is the case then are we Hasshemi? And if so can I not give Zakah to my close relatives?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSince your parents say that you are from the lineage of Sayyiduna Ali\n(Radhiallaahu Anhu), your are effectively a Haashimi. The children of Abu\nTalib and Abbaas are all Haashimi.\n\nThere is really no way to prove your lineage but the claim of your family\nover the generations is sufficient for you in this aspect. Therefore, regard\nyourself as Haashimi - on the basis of your parents claims. Haashimis cannot\nbe given Zakaat. Therefore, if your close relatives are Haashimi or Sayyids,\nyou cannot give them Zakaat. You may give them if they are not Haashimi or\nSayyid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
