  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it halal for me to create a website for intoducing people with the intention of marriage(muslim and non-muslim)? Is it ok to earn a living this way?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, the income from creating a website being Halaal or Haraam depends on the purpose and services provided by the website. If the services are according to the Shari?ah, the income will be Halaal. If the services are Haraam, the income will be Haraam. If the services are contaminated, it will be Makrooh.\n\nTo introduce interested parties in marriage to one another is Mubaah (permissible) if there is nothing un-Islamic in the procedure, for example, free talking, dating, etc. If the introduction leads to anything un-Islamic, then the very act of introducing will be prohibited. Therefore, one has to exercise precaution before introducing the interested parties in marriage to one another. That is not generally possible through the website as we have many reports of abuse through such services.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
