  "question": "What does one say to a sister who is selling food in the Masjid during Jum'ah congregation?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe smell permeates the masjid during Jum'ah which takes the peoples concentration off of the Khutba. Then, when the jummah is over, the men are hanging over the dividers passing their money and blocking the sisters path to the doorway to get the children either back to school, put their shoes on or leave, whichever the case may be. Some times there are men, who come through the curtain that dividesthe doorway access and block the sisters from leaving and refuse to move.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is not permissible to buy and sell food in the Musjid.\n\nIt is against the honour and respect of the Musjid to do so. The trustees of the Musjid should stop the practise.\n\nAnd Allah Taãla Knows Best.\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
