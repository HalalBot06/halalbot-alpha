  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nwhat procedure should be done or what kaffara should be given if a person breaks his fast willingly or due to some problem?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf one willingly breaks a Ramadhaan fast without a valid Shar’ee reason, e.g. illness, etc. then one must keep a Qadhaa fast in lieu thereof. Furthermore, as Kaffaarah, 60 consecutive fasts will have to be kept. If one willingly breaks a fast out of Ramadhaan, then only Qadhaa should be kept without Kaffaarah. However, if one breaks a fast due to a valid Shar’ee reason, then only Qadhaa should be kept without Kaffaarah. This is irrespective of whether the fast was a Ramadhaan fast or not.
