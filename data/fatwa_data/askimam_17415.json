  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf and when space travel does become a possibility for mankind and Muslims may travel into space as part of research or for travel, what is the correct way to pray? Should it be toward the most general direction to the kaba anywhere in the Universe? Or say they are on the surface of the moon and it is fajr time, but they are not on the right side of the moon and they are in the opposite side, what is the prescribed method to pray?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYour curiosity and interest in the Shariah is praiseworthy. However, it would be an exercise of futility on our behalf to answer an irrelative and hypothetical question. If and when the time comes when Muslims travel into space, we will delve into the possible answers.  \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nMl.
