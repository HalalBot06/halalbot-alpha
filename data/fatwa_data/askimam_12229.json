  "question": "A Deobandi Aalim working in a Brelvi masjid! could you please enlighten me on what the Deobandi Akaabireen thought about the Ulama of Brelv?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWith your du'aas I'm a Deobandi Aalim working in a Brelvi Masjid (unity is important!) Mufti Sahib, could you please enlighten me on what the Deobandi Akaabireen thought about the Ulama of Brelv? I, myself lead prayers and have Al-Hamdu Lillaah, with your prayers, got a lot of youngsters on my side.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlhamdulillah, it is very pleasing and encouraging to note that you as a Deobandi Aalim are an Imaam in a Barelvi Musjid. Very few Deobandi Ulama are granted such an opportunity to guide the people on the right path through your position.%0D%0A%0D%0AUnity is important on condition it is based on Qur?aan, Hadith and Shari?ah. You should not compromise on correct beliefs in order to bring about unity. Educate your congregation with wisdom. It is the outstanding feature of the Ulama of Deoband to hold firm on to their beliefs and propagate them to the best of their ability. It is also very pleasing to note that you have influenced many youths on your side. May Allah increase that bounty, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Ulama of Barelvi generally believe in Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] having ilmul ghayb kulli (all the knowledge about the future), and Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] being Haazir and Naazir (omnipotent and omnipresent). Such beliefs are obviously incorrect. It is our observation that many present day Barelvi Ulama do not even know the beliefs of their school of thought. It is, therefore, not advisable to discuss such issues with them or in public.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
