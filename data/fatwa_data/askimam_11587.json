  "question": "Mahdi Dream Assalam 3alykom, This was a very blurry dream with confusing images.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn my dream, I saw big crowds of people fighting. Afterwards I realized that we were the army of the promised mahdi, and I was among those people. I did not see who we were fighting. But what is confusing me is that it all seemed like a part of a big science-fiction movie, such as star-wars. There were also some unknown small creatures on our side, and they using some magic like we see on the television, they had long magician poles, and they issued x-rays out of them. Then, at the end of my dream, I heard someone yelling that rasul allah Muhammad (salla allah 3alyhi wa sallam) is coming, I remember looking back and seeing a camel, but I do not remember seeing him. I am confused, I don?t know if my dream has any significance or if it was just another dream! What are your thoughts? Thank you, jazakom llah khayran\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe world is filled with evil and corruption. Imaam Mahdi (AS) will come\nbefore the final hour.
