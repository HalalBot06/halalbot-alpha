  "question": "Now we know which Hadith is Saheh, Hasan and Zaeef. Why not all the four Matahib can be unite to one taking from four matahib which is nearest to Quran and Saheh Hadith.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe base of Matahib was Quran and Hadith. Perhaps in past not all the Hadith were known to each Imam that is why they concluded the different rules for same topics. Now so much work on hadith has been performed that we know which hadith is Saheh, Hasan or Zaeef. Now why cannot all the matahib can be converted in one. If it is not possible then tell me that what Matahab will the Imam Mehdi and Hazrat Easa Alleh Salam follows or they going to merge the four Matahib in one.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, we wish to point out any ruling in the Qur'aan or Hadith%0D%0Awhich is Qatiyyus-suboot (expressly proven) and Qatiyyud-Dalaalah (expressly%0D%0Aindicative) cannot be debated. There can be no differences of opinion on%0D%0Asuch a matter. All the Fuqahaa are unanimous on that. If there is a ruling%0D%0Awhich is either Qatiyyus-Suboot but not Qatiyyud-Dalaalah or vice versa,%0D%0Athen only there will be differences of opinions among the Fuqahaa based on%0D%0Athe juridical ideologies and principles of interpretation.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe same applies with any ruling in a Hadith. The Fuqahaa were oceans of%0D%0Aknowledge. They were experts in Tafsir, Hadith, Ilmul Kalaam, Usul-e-Tafsir,%0D%0AUsul-e-Hadith (principles of understanding the Qur'aan and principles of%0D%0Aunderstanding Hadith). They had the ability to deduce rulings not expressly%0D%0Amentioned in the Qur'aan and Hadith. The differences of opinion among the%0D%0AImaams are academic and in their deductions expressed intellectual honesty,%0D%0Ahence, the differences of opinions. Imaam Mahdi and Hadhrat Eesa (Alayhimus%0D%0Asalaam) will be Mujtahids and will also make Ijtihaad when the need arise.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
