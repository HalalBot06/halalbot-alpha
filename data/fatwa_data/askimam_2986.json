  "question": "I know that in hanafi prayer books, it says that you are not supposed to raise your hand when going into ruku, and when coming up from ruku,however",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI came across hadith in the 2 saheehs, sahih muslim and sahih bukhari, and both report the sunnah is to raise the hands before and after ruku, the references are sahih bukhari: Volume 1, Book 12, Number 702, 703, 704, and 705 and sahih muslim: Book 004, Number 0758, and 759 is it permissable to follow these hadith in accordance with imam abu haneefah's (rahimuhullah) saying: \"When a hadeeth is found to be saheeh, then that is my madhhab.\" ? jazakAllah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe differences of opinion on raising the hands when going into Ruku and\nreturning from Ruku is based on Afzaliyyat (what is more virtuous). It is\nnot based on Adame-e-Jawaaz (permissibility and non-permissibility). Both\nviews are substantiated in Shari'ah.\n\n· Saalim (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates on the authority of his father that\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) should raise his hands at the\nbeginning of Salaat before Ruku and after it.'\n· Imaam Abu Hanifa (RA) narrates on the authority of Ibraahim from Alqamah\nand Aswad from Abdullah ibn Mas'ood that Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)\nshould not raise his hands except at the beginning of Salaat.\n\n>From the above, it is clear that both raising the hands and not raising of\nthe hands is correct. However, as Hanafis, we follow the ruling given by\nImaam Abu Hanifa.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
