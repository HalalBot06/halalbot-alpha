  "question": "if I travel to another country and get married, is it permissible to have a walima there with the bride's family and then have a second walima in my country with my friends and family?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nInsha'a Allah, if I travel to another country and get married, is it permissible to have a walima there with the bride's family and then have a second walima in my country with my friends and family?\n\nAlso, the Imam of our masjid comes very late for salaat. At times, we begin the salaat after waiting 5, 10, 15, sometimes up to 30 minutes or more after the established Iqaamah time. He usually is coming in with his friends and they get upset (yelling), that we have neglected his right to the iqaamah. What should be done?\n\nAlso, I follow Hanafi madhhab, the Imam is 'salafi'. He showed me a hadith about saying \"ameen\" after the Imam. I told him that I say ameen, but quietly, according to the evidence used by Imaam Abu Hanifah (RA). Everyday and every khutbah afterwards he talks about \"someone shown a hadith, who doesn't act upon it is a kaafir\" and \"mushrik\" and does not return my salaam. What should be done? Jazak Allahu khairan.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Walimah is a Sunnah of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. It should be carried out as Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] carried it out or as closely as possible. The purpose of Walima is to express happiness upon being married and being with the wife. The Walimas of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] were simple. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] also married while he was out of Madinah Munawwarah and on journey. His Walimas were carried out while on journey in a simple way. There is no mention of him repeating the Walimah when he returned to Madina Munawwarah. Alhamdulillah, if you have to travel abroad to marry, you would be presented with an ideal opportunity to have a Walimah while on Safr as Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] did.\n\n2. The Imaam of the Musjid should be on time to perform the Salaat. The purpose of setting a time for the different Salaats is convenience. People know the official times for the different Salaats with Jamaat and attend timeously. If the congregational Salaat is delayed due to the Imaam being delayed, that will cause inconvenience to the Musallees. Many Musallees have limited time and take out time to perform Salaat with Jamaat. If the Jamaat is delayed, they will not attend and the number of Musallees will decrease. An Imaam should endervour to increase the number of people performing Salaat with Jamaat. If he is not on time, an alternate Imaam should be appointed to lead the Salaat. This will be in the broader interest of the Musjid and the congregation.\n\n3. The issue of a loud and soft ‘Aameen’ after reciting Surah al-Faatiha is not of permissibility and non-permissibility. According to the Hanafi Madhab, it is permissible to say the ‘Aameen’ aloud. The issue is of what is virtuous. According to the Hanafi Madhab, it is better to say the ‘Aameen’ softly. There are Ahaadith supporting both views. If the Imaam declares a person a Kaafir for not following one Hadith, then he too is not following the other Hadith. What will he regard himself then? Nevertheless, we will not regard him to be a Kaafir as we believe his practice of loud Aameen is also correct. Which Imaam of a Madhab or his followers follow every Hadith. Some follow some Ahaadith and others follow other Ahaadith. Will all these great Imaams be Kaafirs? It is sad that the Salafi Imaam has embarked on such a serious comment and declares the entire Ummah including himself as Kaafirs by inference. He should make tawbah and never issue such a decree as Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has warned us to be careful on pronouncing Kufr on the next person.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
