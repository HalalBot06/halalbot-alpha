  "question": "question 6696 1) How to deal with woman that wants to work. Do you have any idea like where I can have my wife educated with out braking the law of shariah - like intermingling",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nyou mentioned about some courses like \"Your wife should consider undertaking a course of studying about a Muslim woman?s role and assist other woman. There is a great need for such counseling and guidance, especially in the US. \" Dear, mufti, I just wanted to confirm with you about it once again. Do you have any idea like where I can have my wife educated with out braking the law of shariah - like intermingling. Even, here in muslim learning centers, we find that there are intermingling of sexes. 2) I understand that it is haraam for me to work where other females are working and they come to this place wearing immodest dresses. It is almost impossible here to get the type of job that will allow me to work in accordance with shariah. Can you please advice me on this issue. 3) In the answer you said \"Consider the marital breakdown in the US (4-5) due to woman independency. If she was dependant, or her husband, she would exercise restraint and maintain her marriage.\" - what do you mean by \"in the US (4-5)\". It's not clear to me. Can you clarify it to me please.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Your wife may study Islamic books on the role of the husband and wife in Islam. she should offer advices to Muslim women and first create a base for herself. If she is successful, then more women will refer to her. At that stage, she may charge a reasonable fee for her service of counseling.\n\n2. There are two aspects to your situation; a) The need to earn an income, b) Un-Islamic environment. If there is no alternative to earn an income in an Islamically suitable environment, then you will be excused to earn an income in an un-Islamic environment. In such a situation, control yourself as much as you can and continue looking for a more Islamically suitable environment. It is incorrect to leave employment because of the un-Islamic environment. That will lead to financial difficulties for you and your dependants.\n\n3. 4 -5 refers to 90%\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
