  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have recently been interviewed in a bank for a job. The job is related to Bank Call Center. My role will be to provide work force management to their call center staff. Work Force Management includes Schedules of Call center agents, their performance management like how they are working plus my role will be to provide technical support in call routing / reporting.\n\nI read in one of your fatwas about any technical job in a bank which is not directly related to interest. I do not want to accept this job if this has some problem in it as I dont want to raise my kids with any doubtful income.\n\nMay Allah Guide all of us to earn halal and only halal.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nSince the job is not related to dealing in any interest transactions, it will be permissible for you to accept the position and your income will be halāl.\n\n \n\nPlease see the following link for more details: http://askimam.org/fatwa/fatwa.php?askid=13e57eb7eac2b6122c5052cc903a8097.\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n\n\n\nMufti  Abrar Mirza, (Chicago, US)\nChecked and Approved by:\n\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
