I am unable to determine whether marrying a woman with a child is appropriate in your case or not. Each case needs to be analysed individually.\n\n2. You are the only person who will really be able to make an informed decision. If you feel you will be able to accommodate this child between you and the prospective bride, well and good. However, if you feel that a child may cause problems between you and the wife, you should rather search for someone else. Remember that it is only natural for a woman to give priority to her children over her husband.\n\n3. Continue with Istikhaara.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
