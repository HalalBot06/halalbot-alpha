  "question": "why is it haram? why is it haram to talk to the opposite sex, how are you supposed to meet the right person for you then??",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam, why is it haram to talk to the opposite sex, how are you supposed to meet the right person for you then?? If you suggest that parent \"match us\" I think it?s not right, since you will not really know the person. 2. Why are pictures haram? 3. Why shouldn?t we have friends that are not Muslim? (Some non-Muslim are better than Muslims in their actions). What about Earring, Why Is it haram for a men to wear an earring on his left ear. If he does not do it to resemble woman, but for fashion. You will probably tell me fashion is haram because it is not Muslim, and whoever follows a nation, is from them. Cant you be American /Muslim? Islam is a religion and a way of life, It?s not a Country is it? Please answer me by the Coran and not Hadith, because i only follow the Coran, since a lot of Arabic culture has been mixed up in all of this, I Don?t follow Hadith Thank You and may god bless you\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBrother, there is no benefit in us discussing these issues with you, when you are not prepared to accept the statements of our beloved prophet (Sallalahu alaihi wasallam) as proof.%0D%0A%0D%0APlease look deep into your hear and check the level of your Iman. You claim to follow the Quran, yet what answer do you give to the various verses commanding you to obey the Prophet (sallallahu Alaihi wasallam)? Maybe you would give the normal answer of the misguided \"Munkireen al hadith\"(Rejecters of ahadith) that this was for those who were present in the time of Nabi (sallallahu alaihiasallam). As for us, as the hadith never reached us in a pure and pristine form (according to their baatil opinion), thus we don't have to follow the ahadith. The answer to it is simple:1. You are thus claiming that Allah Ta'ala commanded you to do something without providing the means for it, thus Allah ordered you to do something impossible. This is baatil, as Allah Ta'ala could never order one to do something out of his capacity.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. In that case, Nabi (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) only benefited those in his time, as his teachings never reached those after him. You are then going clearly against the Quran, which emphatically states that Nabi (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) is a mercy for al of mankind! %0D%0A%0D%0A3. You claim to follow the Quran as the hadith has been distorted, our question to you is how do you know that the Quran hasn't been distorted? If you say that Allah Ta'ala clearly states that He will protect the Quran, the simple answer to it is that this verse could be a distortion or fabrication!!%0D%0A%0D%0AThere is no sense in us answering our queries as you deny the very proofs upon which our answers would be based. According to you, it would be permissible to \"marry an animal\", consume faeces, etc. as none of these are expressly forbidden in the Quran. We make dua to Allah Ta'ala to guide you from your deviation and accept us all for the service of his deen, Amin%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMl.
