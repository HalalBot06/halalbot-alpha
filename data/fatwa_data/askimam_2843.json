  "question": "I would like to know if it is permissible to use hydrogen peroxide on the hair. What can you say about the types of alcohols in shampoo, perfium, etc.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Kindly elaborate on the question.\n2. It is not permissible to use deodorants that contain alcohol from grapes\nor date extracts. Such perfumes are impure and Salaat with it is invalid.\nHowever, if the alcohol is synthetic, it is pure and permissible to use.\nSalaat without washing off such perfumes will be valid. Sometimes, it\nbecomes difficult to differentiate between genuine and synthetic alcohol.\nThus, to be on the safe side, one should rather prefer using deodorants and\nperfumes that are labelled as 'alcohol-free', especially when such perfumes\nare easily available.
