  "question": "Raising young daughter in the West",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI belong to a fairly moderate income group. Recently my eldestdaughter attained the age of puberty. This development has placed me in agreat predicament. I was quite affected recently by a lecture I heard on thesins of intermingling of sexes. My daughter attends a public school whereshe is obviously involved in this. While it might appear to be easy to justremove her from school, I have to also consider her future. She definitelyrequires a career in order to make her financially self-sufficient in thesetimes of great economic strife. What should I do under these circumstances?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlmighty Allah Ta%E1la says in the Holy Qur%E3n 'And (women) stay in%0D%0Ayour homes and don't display yourselves like the practice of the first%0D%0AJaahiliyya (pre-Islamic era)'. (Qur%E3n 33:33)%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'A woman is an object of%0D%0Aconcealment. When she comes out; the Shaitaan accompanies her'. (Mishk%E3t)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above quotations clearly indicate that the place of a woman is at home.%0D%0AWhen she emerges out of the house, she becomes the tool of the Shaitaan to%0D%0Aspread mischief and corruption. In these modern times, there is a worldwide%0D%0Acampaign on recognition of women's rights, according to the democratic%0D%0Aideology which includes equality between men and women in earning, rank and%0D%0Aposition. Such a position for women in society breathes corruption and%0D%0Amischief. And the ghastly consequences such a position has already caused%0D%0Aare clear as day-light for all those of true intelligence.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe harms of giving your daughter 'secular education' under the existing%0D%0Aconditions is greater than the benefits. It is not permissible to risk the%0D%0Ahonour of your daughter at the expense of securing her economic future.%0D%0ALooking at the dangers and harms in schools, even the greatest worldly need%0D%0Acannot justify the reason for sending your daughter to school.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe sustenance of every individual is the responsibility of All%E3h: 'There is%0D%0Anot a single creature on earth except that All%E3h Ta%E1la has taken the%0D%0Aresponsibility of its sustenance'. (Qur%E3n 11:6)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Fuqahaa have explained that firstly the father has to support his%0D%0Adaughter until marriage. Upon marriage, the husband has to support her. If%0D%0Athe husband dies or divorces her, and she has elderly working sons, it is%0D%0Atheir responsibility to support her. If she does not have sons, then the%0D%0Afather will have to support her again. If he is not in a position to support%0D%0Aher then, her brothers and relatives should support her. Islam has laid down%0D%0Aprinciples to support a woman in every turn of her life. If any of the above%0D%0Adoes not materialize, she can even support herself by maintaining her honour%0D%0Aand dignity by doing something from indoors. She may do cooking, sewing,%0D%0Abaking, etc. and sell. There are many avenues of income. The secular form of%0D%0Aeducation is not the only way of earning an income. How many secular%0D%0Agraduates are penniless due to unemployment and how many secularly%0D%0Auneducated women have regular income through private services?%0D%0A%0D%0AYour concern should be to give your daughter good Islamic education, teach%0D%0Aher to be a loyal wife and responsible mother. Teach her the life of%0D%0Asimplicity and you may teach her some profession like sewing, etc. could%0D%0Ahelp her during a financial crisis.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Knows Best.%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
