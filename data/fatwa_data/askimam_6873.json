  "answer": "QUESTION\nI need to know what isthe correct islamic way to upbring the children, also what subjects to teach them and from what age, my kids are 4 and 5 respectively. Also what to do that they will become good piuos muslims inshallah and also hafiz.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe apologise for the delay in replying. %0D%0A%0D%0AChildren at the age of 4%2F5 are ripe for learning and retain a lot. Their main medium of learning is through observing, listening, and responding through imitation. The greatest difficulties in our opinion, which youth face is indentification as Muslims. This confidence and indentity as Muslims must be instilled with abudance of love, encouragement and congratulating every good farz, sunnat and other nafl acts carried out by the child. Include rewards of gifts on pleasing actions.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"Ubringing of Children in Islaam\" is a good book to obtain.Instill love of the Quraan, the noble ettiquettes of Nabi (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) in every aspect of live. Children also enjoy learning rituals. Teach them salaat etc from a young age. Keep the children away from environment and influence of TV, Cinemas and Music. Find alternative enjoyment of nature, -to play with toys, friends , etc. Education in every field from the Islaamic aspect is essential. However as parents ensure your earnings are halaal, you as parents start practicing on the noble Islaamic ettiquettes and fulfilling of duties including that of family freinds, neighboursetc. Lots of duas for your child is essential . As parents also are role models and children reflect habits and mannerrims of parents. Create the environment in your home, not rigidly but with love and encouragement.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala make it Easy.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A2SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
