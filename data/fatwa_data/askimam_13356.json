  "question": "Can I talk about Sex on phone with my wife? I got married with her 1 month ago through PROXY",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCanÂ I talk about Sex on phone with my wife? I got married with her 1 month ago through PROXY Nikah because of the fact that i am not living in Pakistan right now. but i have plan to go there and do Rukhsati and bring her here with me. We talk every day on phone, some times 3 times a week.\n\nI do respect her feelings and I do talk about sex or sexual behaviour on phone with her but as far as i feel comfirtable to do that. Becuase I am living with other people right now and they can listen to me some times. But If i tell her that i cant talk openely she gets angry.\n\nAm i commiting SIN by doing that? what are my boundries according to Islam as far as I am on the phone with her. Can i talk about her private parts/sex on phone or send her Kiss on phone? and what if dont do that just because of the problems i may get if i do?\n\nIt is almost immpossible to make her understand that some time it is even immposible to talk with her on phone privatly.\n\nPlease advise me. As i am very disturb about her behaviour and worried about my responsiblities.\n\nW'Salam\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nJazakallah for writing to the institute regarding the problems you are encountering so early in your union. Firstly, since you have made nikah already, (even though by proxy) it is acceptable to have intimate conversations with your wife.\n\nYou should however ascertain what she expects you to do when you cannot talk to her freely whilst you are living with strangers. One would expect that as an adult she would understand your situation and be more supportive. In all honestly, this is not an issue which give rise to anger and frustration. It is up to you to deal with this matter and make clear that you are disturbed by her responses. Marriage partners need to support, co-operate, understand, and make sabr in times of need as situations demand. At some time or the other, some of us have to put our own needs and desires on hold when difficulties arise. A time comes when we have to look to the needs of our partners till a balance in the situation comes about.\n\nMay Allah ta'ala guide both of you to work out a way of communicating with each other in an amicable and mature way.Ameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nSister Fadila\nSOCIAL DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
