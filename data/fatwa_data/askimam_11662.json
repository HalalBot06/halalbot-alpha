  "answer": "QUESTION\nMufti Sb. I have a question in response to your answer no. 11271 on April 29. You have said that oral sex between husband and wife is makrooh-e-tehrimi or close to haram. Do you have any reference (from quran or hadith) about this or is this your personal opinion. As far as I know it is ok as Allah has said in Quran ?Your wives are as a tilth unto you; so approach your tilth when or how ye will;\" [al-Baqarah 2:223]. And prophet (SWS) never forbidden any thing related to this except approaching wives during menses and from rear (anus).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour substantiation for the permissibility of oral sex from the verse in reference is incorrect. The Arabic word ?Harth? translated as tilt refers to the private part and not the entire body.\n\nThe subsequent word ?Anna? could be interpreted in two ways, ?min ayna? (from wherever) or ?kayfa? (however). The former interpretation is incorrect as that would mean one may enter his wife from wherever ? front or back (anus). This will not be conducive to the word tilt as nothing is produced from the anus ? like a farm. The latter interpretation (kayfa) is conducive as it indicates one may assume any posture during intimacy when coming to one?s tilt which is the front private part. The word ?harth? does not include the mouth and has nothing to do with oral sex.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
