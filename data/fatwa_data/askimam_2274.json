  "question": "I haven't memorized Dua al Qunoot for the witr prayer. Can I read Sura Ikhlas three times instead? Also, what is salat al tasbeeh and what are its benefits?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nJazakAllah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. One may recite any Du'aa from the Qur'aan and Ahaadith in place of Du'%0D%0Aaa-e-Qunoot.%0D%0A2. Kindly refer 'Salaat al-Tasbeeh' - attached%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ASALAATUT TASBEEH%0D%0A1. Great virtue has been mentioned for salaatut%0D%0Atasbeeh in the Hadith. One is rewarded abundantly on offering this salaat.%0D%0ARasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam had taught this salaat to his%0D%0Auncle, Hadrat Abbas radiallahu anhu, and said to him that by offering this%0D%0Asalaat, all your future, past, minor and major sins will be forgiven. He%0D%0Aalso said to him that if it is possible, he should try to offer this%0D%0Asalaat daily. If it cannot be offered daily, then once a week, if not,%0D%0Athen once a month, if not, then once a year. And if even this is not%0D%0Apossible, then at least once in a lifetime. The method of offering this%0D%0Asalaat is as follows: intention should be made for four rakaats of salaat.%0D%0AAfter reciting the thanaa', Surah Faatihah and another Surah, the person%0D%0Ashould recite the following dua fifteen times before going into ruku:%0D%0A%0D%0AHe should then go into ruku and after reading:%0D%0A%0D%0Athree times, he should again recite the above dua ten%0D%0Atimes.%0D%0AHe should then stand up from the ruku and after%0D%0Areading:%0D%0A%0D%0Ahe should again recite the above dua ten times. He%0D%0Ashould then go into sajdah and after reading:%0D%0A%0D%0Athree times, he should again recite the above dua ten%0D%0Atimes. After coming up from the first sajdah, he should again recite the%0D%0Aabove dua ten times. He should then go for the second sajdah and again%0D%0Arecite it ten times. He should then get up from the second sajdah and sit%0D%0Aand recite it ten times. After reciting it ten times, he should stand up%0D%0Afor the second rakaat. The second rakaat should be offered in the same%0D%0Amanner. When he sits after the second rakaat for at-tahiyyaat, he should%0D%0Arecite this dua ten times first, and then recite the at-tahiyyaat. In this%0D%0Amanner, he should offer all four rakaats.%0D%0A2. He can recite any Surah that he wishes in these%0D%0Afour rakaats - there is no specific Surah to be recited.%0D%0A3. If he forgets and recites less than the normal%0D%0Anumber of tasbeehs or completely forgets to recite them in any particular%0D%0Aposture, then in the next posture he should also recite those tasbeehs%0D%0Athat he forgot to recite, e.g. he forgot to recite the ten tasbeehs in%0D%0Aruku and remembered this while he was in sajdah. He should therefore%0D%0Arecite the ten that he forgot as well as the ten tasbeehs of sajdah. In%0D%0Athis case he will actually have to recite twenty tasbeehs in his sajdah.%0D%0AIt should be remembered that 75 tasbeehs have to be read in one rakaat and%0D%0A300 tasbeehs in four rakaats. If one recites 300 tasbeehs in four rakaats,%0D%0Ahe will Insha-Allah get the reward of salaatut tasbeeh. But if he did not%0D%0Acomplete this number in the four rakaats, this salaat will become a nafl%0D%0Asalaat and will no longer be salaatut tasbeeh.%0D%0A4. If sajdah-e-sahw becomes wajib for some reason or%0D%0Athe other, the tasbeehs will not be recited in both the sajdahs of sahw%0D%0Anor in the qa'dah thereafter.%0D%0A5. Sajdah-e-sahw does not become wajib for completely%0D%0Aforgetting the tasbeehs or for reciting less than the stipulated number.%0D%0A"
