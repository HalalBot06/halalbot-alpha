By you placing you money in the bank, you are aiding in Haraam as the bank is using your money to finance interest- bearing loans.%0D%0A2. You are involved in the sin of receiving interest as the money given to you by the bank is interest.%0D%0A%0D%0AThus, a person shouldn't keep money in a bank account unless under dire circumstances. As for the interest that you have received, it will have to be disposed of, by giving it in charity to a poor person. This should not be done with the intention of gaining reward, but rather with the intention of disposing of it.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen it comes to calculating zakaat, the interest will not be added, but the principle amount in the bank will be .%0D%0A%0D%0ABear in mind the following when calculating zakaat:%0D%0AZakaat is paid on accumulated cash, not on income.You should work out in what month (Islamic, not solar) you had accumulated cash equivalent to the nisab. This month will now be your zakaat month. If for example it was April 2000 which corresponds with Muharram 1421, then Muharram is your Zakaat month. Now you have to work out how much accumulated cash you had in Muharram 1422(April 2001) and work out 2,5 % of that. Do the same for Muharram 1423(March 2002) and this Muharram 1424 (March 2003).%0D%0A%0D%0AYou could find out the nisab, by contacting an alim in your area.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
