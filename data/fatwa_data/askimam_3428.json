  "question": "Moonsighting (Hilaal) in Saudi Arabia and its implications worldwide.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI wanted to request respected Mufti Ebrahim Desai to please read and if appropriate, post for long term on websites Insha'Allaah my attached material on \"Hilaal Sighting in Saudi Arabia & Its Implications Worldwide\", based on personal research and the contributions of several brothers (Jazahum Allahu Khayran). It includes valuable first hand information on the UmmUlQura Calendar and Fatawa of Sheikh Al Othaimeen (RH) of Saudi Arabia, who was kind enough to give us private audience and wrote and gave me one Fatwa directly.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nI have studied that document and appreciate your efforts in the matter.\n\nThe Jurists (Fuqahaa) have differences of opinion on whether\nIkhtilaaf-e-Mataalih is considered (Mu’tabar) or not. According to the\nZaahir-e-Riwaayat (view considered for Fatwa), it is not considered which\nmeans that one reliable sighting anywhere (not only Saudia Arabia) in the\nworld is valid. However, the problem in the sighting of the moon, as you\ncorrectly stated that there are many errors in the sighting of the moon in\nSaudi Arabia. If the errors are rectified and after Shahaadah of an\nindividual’s sighting the moon, decision is taken in consultation with the\nofficials of the Hilaal Sighting Committee, then it will be valid for the\nentire Muslim Ummah. Similar procedures must be put in place in other\ncountries as well, as the moon may be sighted elsewhere and not necessarily\nSaudia Arabia.\n\nIn view of the present discrepancies in moon sighting, the view that\nIkhtilaaf-e-Mataalih is considered may be adopted and each country should\nmake their own independent decisions. It is incorrect for the Muslims in\nNorth America (especially the Arab brethren) to follow Saudia Arabia’s\nruling on Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha due to the moonsighting being\ninconsistent with Shari’ah laws of sighting the moon.\n\nWe appreciate Shaykh’s comments in his address to us and humbly request for\nyour pious Du’aas.\n\nand Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
