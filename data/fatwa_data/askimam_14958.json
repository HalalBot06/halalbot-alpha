  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIn fatwa no: 14913 it was said that it is undesirable to make dua and Zikr after the fardh salaat and be should be done after praying the sunnat. But in an earlier question about best times to make dua, you had given a list of ways, manners  and times that makes most appropriate conditions for acceptance of dua. One of the time mentioned was making dua after every fardh salaat.\n\nBoth the things mentioned appears contradictory to each other. Can you please clarify which is the correct way?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nOne may make a short dua immediately after fardh salah. A lengthy dua and zikr may be made after the sunnats.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
