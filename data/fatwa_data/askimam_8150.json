  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)Discharge after menses ...After my menses get over that is on the 8th or 10th day and after i finish taking my ghusl there is some white thick discharge coming out with some pink shade like strands in it or even red,every time i go to urine does this mean that i still mean i cannot do the namaz until and unles i take the ghuls once again.... 2)what is the ghusl procedure for men and women and in ur section u have mentioned the method of ghusal but not any saying(Like duwa) to be recited while taking the ghusal..Also clarify for women after intercourse and after menses.. 3)Want to know that if i change the baby nappy does the Wudu break and till and if not than till how many yrs of age we can change the child without worrying the wudu doesnt break?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The maximum period of Haydh (menses) is ten days. If you had menses for ten days, take a bath and resume your obligation of performing Salaat. Any discharge, thereafter, white, pink or mixed will be regarded as Istihaadhah which does not necessitate Ghusl. That invalidates Wudhu only. If you experience any discharge besides white after 8 days, that will be regarded as Haydh. You cannot take a bath to resume your Shar?ee obligation of performing Salaat until completing ten days. A complete white discharge is not Haydh.\n\n2. There is no Du?aa when making Ghusl. The method of Ghusl after menses and intercourse are both the same.\n\n3. Changing the nappy of the child in the state of Wudhu does not invalidate the Wudhu.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
