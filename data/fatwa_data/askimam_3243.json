  "answer": "QUESTION\nJazakallah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHOW TO MAKE GHUSL%0D%0A%0D%0AThe following is the Sunnat method of taking Ghusl. Proceed with the Ghusl,%0D%0Astep by step, as enumerated hereunder:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. First wash both hands as far as the wrists. The hands should not be%0D%0Adipped in the basin of water for washing. Water should either run from the%0D%0Atap on to the hands or poured from a container.%0D%0A2. Wash the parts of istinja (the private parts and surrounding area). This%0D%0Ashould be washed whether there is najaasat (impurity) or not.%0D%0A3. Wash the part of the body wherever there be some impurity.%0D%0A4. Make a full Wudhu now. However, if Ghusl is being taken in a place where%0D%0Athe water pools around the feet, then delay the washing of the feet until%0D%0Athe end of the Ghusl.%0D%0A5. After Wudhu, pour water thrice over the head.%0D%0A6. Thereafter, pour water thrice over the right shoulder.%0D%0A7. Then, pour water thrice over the left shoulder. The water should be%0D%0Apoured in such a way that the entire body is thoroughly drenched.%0D%0A8. If the feet were not washed at the time of Wudhu, wash them now.%0D%0AWhile pouring the water, rub well on the body to ensure that no spot%0D%0Aremains dry.%0D%0A%0D%0A'A Perfect Wudhu wards off rewards from you' (Umar bin Khattab (Radhiallaahu%0D%0A%C1nhu))%0D%0A%0D%0AKitaabut Tahaarah%0D%0AYoung Men's Muslim Association%0D%0AActonville%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE METHOD OF WUDHU%0D%0AN.B.: The person making Wudhu will be referred to as mutawad-dhi.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe mutawad-dhi should endeavour to face the qiblah while making Wudhu. It%0D%0Ais best to sit on a raised or high place when making Wudbu in order to be%0D%0Aout of reach of water splashing. It is far nobler and meritorious to make%0D%0AWudhu by pouring water from some container, e.g. a jug. Use of a tap in%0D%0AWudhu entails great waste of water, and Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam) has warned against wasting water even at the river bank.%0D%0A%0D%0AMaking niyyat (intention) of Wudhu, recite (BISMILLA-HIR RAHMANIR-RAHIM). In%0D%0Athe Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.%0D%0A%0D%0AFirst of all, wash both hands as far as the wrists, thrice, beginning with%0D%0Athe right hand.%0D%0A%0D%0AThereafter rinse the mouth thrice and use a Miswaak. In the absence of a%0D%0AMiswaak use a coarse cloth to clean the teeth. Remember that a toothbrush is%0D%0Anot an adequate substitute for a Miswaak. However, since the use of a cloth%0D%0Ais in the Sunnah when a Miswaak is not available, it (cloth) could be%0D%0Aregarded as an adequate substitute. If the toothbrush is made of bristles%0D%0A(pig's hairs), its use will be haraam.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf one is not fasting then gargle as well. Thereafter apply water thrice%0D%0Ainto the nostrils with the right hand and clean the nose with the little%0D%0Afinger of the left hand. If the mutawad-dhi is fasting, water should not be%0D%0Adrawn higher than the soft or fleshy part of the nostrils.%0D%0A%0D%0AWash then the entire face thrice. The limits of the face for Wudhu purpose%0D%0Ais from the limits of the hair at the forehead until below the chin, and%0D%0Afrom ear to ear. Water must reach below the eyebrows as well. This is%0D%0Afollowed by making khilaal of the beard.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe right hand, including the arm and elbow, should then be washed thrice.%0D%0AThen wash the left hand in exactly the same manner.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis is followed by making masah of the whole head; masah of the ears; masah%0D%0Aof the nape (i.e. back of the neck); and khilaaal of the fingers of both%0D%0Ahands.%0D%0A%0D%0AThereafter wash the right foot, including the ankles, thrice; then wash the%0D%0Aleft foot in the same way. Make khilaal of the toes.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe perfect Wudhu requires that all the Sunnat duaa be recited at the%0D%0Aappropriate times during Wudhu and after Wudhu.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
