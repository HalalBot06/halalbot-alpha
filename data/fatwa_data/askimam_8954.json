  "answer": "QUESTION\n1- Every time after I get up from relieving & washing myself, I feel a few drops of water falling down before wiping my private part. I dont think they are urine because I cannot feel the coming of urine. But I'm not sure. And shaitan makes me think they might be urine & so I keep doubting about this & wash my self again thus wasting time & water. How do I get rid of these thoughts or should I wash myself whenever I feel like this just to be sure I'm clean & my Salah will be valid? (I?m sure I don?t have any urinary problem). Should I just ignore it? Please Adise. 2- Shaitan keeps telling me in Salah & when I'm in Wudu that I may have leaked a drop of urine even though I cannot recall having the feeling of urine coming out. I feel like this when I'm going 2 sit, prostrate, etc or other such actions which make my private parts move. Then I go wash myself & change underwear (it is dry) because I'm not sure. Due to this is I have no peace & I cannot concentrate on anything, even Salah. This happens many times in a day. Please Advise. Sorry for such long question, but I will be very grateful for answer. Jazakallah. May Allah reward u for ur time & patience.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nUndoubtedly, these doubts are from Shaytaan. You need to build confidence in yourself. The solution to your problem is simple. All it needs is ?will-power?. When you complete your Istinjaa like normal, be relaxed and comfortable and make yourself aware that you re clean and its over. All other ideas, doubts, thoughts and whispers are from Shaytaan. Ignore them.\n\nJust continue like normal, make your Wudhu and complete your Salaat. Concentrate in your Salaat. Do not think about how you washed yourself during Salaat. Just think about the power and majesty of Allah Ta?ala. You have to build this confidence within yourself within yourself to remove these doubts. Also, make constant Du?aa to Allah Ta?ala to make it easy for you to concentrate in Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
