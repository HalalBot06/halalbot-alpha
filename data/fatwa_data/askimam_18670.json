  "question": "How come \"ALLAH\" is not mentioned in any book in the past?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAslam-u-Alyqum I have one question, like many prophets came in the past to spread Islam. Then How come \"ALLAH\" is not mentioned in any book in the past. I have no doubt about Allah's existence. But I just wonder how come we don't have anything left from other prophets.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\n \n\nIn regards to not hearing much of the name of Allah in other books, it could be due to the fact that many of the world’s main religions today translate their books into the English language. Instead of actually writing the name Allah, they translate it as “God”. This is known to be the case in many books of the Bible such as the Book of Deuteronomy, the Book of Chronicles, the Book of Nehemiah, the Book of Ezra, and the Book of Daniel (Al-Zaboor). In the original Hebrew text, the name of Allah is actually written and read as Allah. It is often transliterated as Elah. However, in the English translations of these books, the passages are written as God and not the name, Allah. Kindly refer to the article below for reference:\n\nHebrew Names of God \n\nElah and Elah Constructs as given in the Tanakh\n\nThe origin of the Aramaic word Elah is somewhat uncertain, though it might be related to a root meaning “fear” or “reverence.”  It is found only in the books of Ezra and Daniel. Notice the Mappiq in the final Hey for this Name: e-laH.\n\n\nElah and Constructs\nFor each name in the list below, I provide the following information:\n\nThe Hebrew text for the name\nThe most common English transliteration (in italics)\nA definition for the name, references to the Tanakh, and frequency information\nAdditional comments, if applicable.\n\nGod\n\nElah. [basic form]\nAramaic. Name for God as Awesome One.\nReference: Deut. 32:15; 2 Chr. 32:15; Neh. 9:17; Ezr. 5:1, 11; 6:14; 7:12, 19, 21, 23; Dan. 2:18, 23, 28, 37, 44f, 47; 3:15, 28f; 6:8, 13.\n\n(www.hebrew4christians.com/Names_of_G-d/Elah/elah.html)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla knows best\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai \nDārul Iftāa"
