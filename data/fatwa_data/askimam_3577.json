It would be greatly appreciated. Also. I have been recently reading into Sayyid-Qutb, Hasan al Bana and the Ikhwan movement. Unfortunately, my research has been cut-short due to the lack of knowledge online. (most is in Arabic), if they have a chapter in Canada, and how I can get involved. I thank you in advance.
