  "question": "Interpretation of three dreamsâ€¦thank you very much brother",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs Salamaleykum .In my first dream I saw that I was in Jeddah( up and everybody in my neighborhood is eating sweets which has poison in them. They are eating the sweet because Qayamat is near and they don?t want to face any harsh punishments from evil ppl (I think like dajjal) so, they plan to die. Everybody was really happy, and I too was eating the eating the sweet with them. In my 2nd dream, I see that the day of judgment is here and everybody is standing out of their graves as, Allah (SWT) is checking their records. I am also standing in my grave. I also know in my dream that people who have the most pimples on their body are the ones who committed the most sins and the people with the least pimples have not so many sins. When I look at myself, I see that I have pimples but not a lot. And in the third dream, I see that Qiyamat is near..and the whole world is in chaos, people are going crazy, the whole world is in terror. And I see myself being shot by a person wearing a face mask and holding a gun and I keep repeating to myself, its okay, im going to Allah(SWT),I will feel no pain. Im going to my God!Could u please interpret these dreams for me.And also may I add that up to 16 years old i really didn?t pay attention to my religon but suddently after that, a big incident happened and my life was just a huge mess..but Allah(SWT) gave me strength and made my life a sheer bliss again. And after that, my stength in Allah(SWT) has dramatically changed. Thankyou very much\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAll three dreams indicate death and Barzakh (immediate life after death) and\nQiyaamat (day of judgment).\n\nNo human being can escape any one of the three stages. Therefore, one should\nprepare for success in all three stages by being obedient to Allah Ta'ala\nand following his injunctions.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
