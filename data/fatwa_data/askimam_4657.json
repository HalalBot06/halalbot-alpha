  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have a sunnat beard ie. one fist length, for the past year. For the past few months I had numerous dreams where my beard has been shaved off or fell of. But in all the the instances the beard was taken off by sickness, by accident or by force and not purposely by me. I then feel depressed and very bad. I then wake up and feel thankful that I still have my beard.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe make Du'aa to Allah Ta'ala to protect you from any misfortune, Aameen.\n\nWe advise you turn your gaze to Allah and also make Du'aa to Him. Also offer\nsome Sadaqaat (charity) to the poor and needy.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
