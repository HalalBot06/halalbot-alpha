  "answer": "QUESTION\nQ 1) I am a hanafi and my kids go to a salaf I mosque, they just go to read the quran , I what to know is it permissible to go to a moque of salafi ? Q2) sometimes I give crisps and drinks to the children in the mosque as a sadaqa the fist time they accepted it but know they refuse ? Is it ok to give things like that to kids as sadaqa to mosques? And shouls I move mosque or is it ok to keep at the same moquse.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If there is no other Musjid under Hanafi control near to you, then to send your kids to learn the Qur?aan only to a Salafi mosque will be permissible. Care should be taken that they are not influenced by the Salafis as far as the other aspects of Deen are concerned. However, if there is a Hanafi Musjid nearby, then no effort should be spared in sending them there.\n\n2. To whom and to which institution you give your Sadaqah (not Zakaat) is entirely your decision. You may change or remain with the same Musjid as you please. In fact, Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] states, ?Every good action is sadaqah?.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
