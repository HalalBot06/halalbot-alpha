  "question": "Is there any other chain of it except that of Muhammad bin Jabir reported in Darqutni?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n\nI want to ask as Imam Sufyan Thawri was a Mudallis so does that weaken the Hadith of Sayyidina Abdullah bin Masood regarding not raising hands except in the beginning of Salah found  in Tirmidhi,Abu Dawud and Nisai? In the chain of this Hadith Sufyan Thawri narrated by saying 'ann' and some people argue that if a Mudallis narrates with 'ann' then the Hadith is weak. Please answer with solid refernce if it has been clearly stated that he heard that particular Hadith.\n \nIs there any other chain of it  except that of Muhammad bin Jabir reported in Darqutni? I know many scholars have authenticated this Hadith but please clarify the point of Tadlis of Sufyan Thawri rahimahullah alaih.\n \nI submitted the question 6 days ago as well. Kindly do reply.\n \n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThe books on Jarah wat Ta’deel are filled with praises in favour of Imam Sufyaan Thawri (rahimahullah) even though he made Tadlees, which was very seldom. He was known for his phenomenal memory and high level of piety. He was also well known for his leadership in Hadeeth.\n\nIbn Hajar (rahimahullah) in his book Tabaqaat ul Mudalliseen has divided the Mudalliseen into 5 categories. Imam Sufyaan Thawri (rahimahullah) falls into the second category. \n\nمن احتمل الائمة تدليسه وأخرجوا له في الصحيح لامامته وقلة تدليسه في جنب ما روى كالثوري :الثانية      \n(طبقات المدلسين ص 13  مكتبة المنار – الأردن)  \n\n Those who the Aimmah have tolerated their Tadlees and have categorised his narrations as authentic because of his leadership (in the science of Hadeeth) and a minimal amount of Tadlees e.g. Imam Thawri (rahimahullah).\n\nImam Bukhari has mentioned that the Tadlees made by Imam Sufyaan Thawri (rahimahullah) were very few.\n\nوقال البخاري ما أقل تدليسه (طبقات المدلسين ص 32 مكتبة المنار – الأردن) \n\nSince the Tadlees made by Imam Sufyaan Thawri (rahimahullah) is tolerated and there are Shawahid (supporting narrations) found, this narration will not be termed as weak on the bases of it being narrated with “Ann”. Furthermore not every Mu’anan narration is Munqati’.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
