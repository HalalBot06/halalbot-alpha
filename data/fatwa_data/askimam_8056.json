  "answer": "QUESTION\nmy question 4 u is that i am a married man and i want to know if i can record my wife and i performing intercourse? this will not b 4 others to view but just for my wife and i. 2. my freind got married undercover as in his parents dont know tht he is married, he paid the meher and performed nikah himself as in there was no moulana present, he asked the questions himself and made the dua himself though ther wer 3 sane male witnesses present. Is his nikah valid\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is Haraam (strictly prohibited) to record the intercourse with your wife even if it is for personal view and not for others. The act of recording the intercourse is against shame and modesty. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Shame is a great branch of Imaan.? (Mishkaat)\n\n2. You did not mention the role of the woman (wife) in the Nikah. Kindly explain.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
