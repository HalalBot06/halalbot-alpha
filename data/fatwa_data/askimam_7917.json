  "question": "what is the diffrence between SADQA and KHAIRAT",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nas in my whole life i have given \"HASBE TAWFEEK KHAIRAT \" but have neversaid this as SAQDA.i just made intention this is zakat or khairat.So kindly elaborate the diffrence between khairatsadqaand zakat.2. I have recently purchased a house for the purpose of living myself with my family inshallah. i want to know if i hae to pay zakat on this house. And i have another house in another city as well . both hosues are not on rent they are empty and have no income from that . i myself live in germany and when i come for vacation i live in the 2nd house. so do i have to pay zakaat on any of the house. What if they are left for one year ? what now . JAZAKALLAH\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The word Sadaqah may also refer to Zakaat. However, Sadaqah generally refers to optional charity. The word Khairaat is an Urdu word which also refers to optional charity. Therefore, if your intention at the time of giving was Zakaat, the Zakaat will be discharged. There is no harm in using the word Zakaat instead of Sadaqah.\n\n2. There is no Zakaat on personal items. Therefore, if the house is used for personal use, Zakaat on the house is not necessary.\n\n3. Since there is no income accrued from the second house, no Zakaat is necessary on this house too.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
