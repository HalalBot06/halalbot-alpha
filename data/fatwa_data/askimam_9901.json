  "question": "Are we supposed to get worldly education and become scientists, doctors, engineers, etc.? Is this the meaning of surah iqraa?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf we're not supposed to, then how are we going to defeat the kuffar? Jazaakallahu khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhile seeking of worldly knowledge is permissible and even commendable in certain circumstances, it is not the purpose of man's creation. Our purpose is Allah, who when attained, will fulfill all needs. Allah says; \"Is not Allah sufficient for his servant?\".(Quran) If a believer pleases Allah, Allah will defeat his enemies%0D%0A%0D%0AIf worldly knowledge is sought as a means to assist mankind, thereby pleasing Allah, then it is rewarding as well. If such knowledge or the means toward it cause distance from Allah, or involves breaking His law, as is a common problem nowadays, it is harmful and detrimental. Surah Iqra' speaks about creation of man and the honours bestowed upon him by Allah. One of these is that Allah has granted him the capacity to understand, learn and preserve knowledge. This is one of those qualities that set him apart from the lesser creations.
