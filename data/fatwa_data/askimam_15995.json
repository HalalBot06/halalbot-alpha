  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have been invited to a company annual gathering. I will be sitting at a table with muslim collegues and don't drink . I have no certain information, but I fear some other people present in the gathering might drink alcahol.\n\nShould I go to this party ?\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf one is certain from beforehand that vice and sin will take place at such gatherings and they will not be able to stop the vice then one should not participate. \n\nIf he had no knowledge from ahead of time of the vice then one will see if he is a prominent figure in society to whom people follow and take his actions to be proofs.  If he is such, he should not remain at the gathering and excuse himself.  If he is not of such status, he may remain at the gathering as long as the vice is not present directly on the table in front of him. \n\nFatawa Mehmoodiya (18/119) Jamia Farooqiya\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
