  "question": "1)Is the sunnah way of praying to pray Fard in the mosque with congreation and pray sunnat/nafl at home?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n2)Why is it scholars always talk about the middle prayer (Asar) being the most important prayer and to pray this prayer without delay? 3)The number of rakat in Prayers seems to vary amongst the muslims, e.g some muslims pray only 2-4 rakats after the 2 fard in Jumma yet in England we pray 4 sunnah, 2 sunnah and 2 nafl (optional) after the 2 fard. Where does this difference come from? 4)Is Witr Prayer part of the Isha Prayer? and when is the best time to pray Witr? 5)Please tell me about Salat Duhaa/Awaabeen what are its virtues?, you mention in question 104 that it should be prayed after Magrib, however in the following book;'Perfecting the Obligatory, by Abdulla Ibn Sulayman/Ibn Muhammed Al-Marzook' page 36 mentions to pray this Prayer mid morning and the prayer ends midday please advise if there are mixed opinions regarding this Prayer. Wa'Salaam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The sunnah manner of performing the sunnah and nafl prayers is that they should be performed at home. However on account of the fact that most homes today are such that as soon as one enters them, he gets distracted from his salah, thus the Ulama have mentioned that performing them in the masjid would be better, except for one who knows that he would not be distracted from them at home.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Allah subhaanahu wa Ta'ala has expressly ordered us in the Quran to guard the middle prayer, thus the Ulama place great emphasis on it. A reason given is that on account of being involved in rounding up the sales of the day many people miss this Salah, thus the need for its performance to be emphasised.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. This difference is based on the different ahadith mentioning the Rakaat performed by Nabi (sallallahu Aaihi wasallam) and the Sahabah (Radhiallahu Anhum) after Jumu'a. Some narrations mention 2, others 4 while others mention 2 and 4. Thus the preferred view in the Hanafi mazhab is to perform both 4 and 2.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. The witr salah follows the Esha prayer and serves as a completion for it. The best time for one who trusts himself to wake up, is in the last one third of the night, just before dawn. If one doesn't trust himself to wake up, then he should perform it before sleeping.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Salat ad-Duha, also known as chast, is a salah of between 2 and twenty rakaat performed during the day once the sun as risen well. This has also been called \"Awwaabeen\" in the hadith. A salah of 6 rakaat performed after maghrib salah is known as \"Awwaabeen\". We generally refer to the first as Chast or Duha and to the second as Awwaabeen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMl.
