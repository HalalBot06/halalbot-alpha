If yes, after how much time from the first time I performed the salah(that is how much time after the first 7 days). Can it be performed at any time during the day or last thing at night before sleeping?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is no time and time limit for performing Istikhaara.\n\nIstikhaara should be continued until one is confident of the decision based on the pure feeling in the heart after making Istikhaara.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
