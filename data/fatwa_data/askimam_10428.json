  "answer": "QUESTION\nHi, I got married last year when I went to Pakistan. While I was in Pakistan me and my husband had an argument. He got angry and then said he gives me Talaaq three times. At that Time I didn?t take any notice. When I got back to England we were talking on the phone, and once he got angry and again said he gives me talaaq three times. Where do I stand? Last week he came to England. During night I said I don?t want to have sex until I find out where I stand. But then he forced on to me and raped me. He really has hurt me. I don?t know what to do. I don?t want to spend the rest of my life with him. Am I in the wrong. Has he got right to rape me?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen you were in Pakistan and your husband issued you three divorces, you were divorced then by Talaaq-e-Mughalladha (permanently irrevocable divorce). You are no more his wife.\n\nYou have reacted correctly by refusing him intimacy. We advise you seek legal assistance to protect yourself from your ex-husband and his abuse to you.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
