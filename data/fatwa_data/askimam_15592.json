  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs a Muslim man, which hairs on my body should I shave?Â \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe pubic hair, the hair in and around the rear of a person, the armpits and the moustache should be removed. It is advisable that one remove the hair from these parts of the body once a week. However, should one not do so, then he must remove it within a period of 40 days. If it is not removed in that time, the person will be sinful. (Fataawa Rahimiyyah, vol.8, pg 118) (Raddul Muhtar, vol 5, pg 358)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Ya'qoob Dadabhai,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
