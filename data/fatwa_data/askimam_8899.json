  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy husband started masturbating 7 years ago without ejaculation and we had lots of fights over that but he denying that can ZI ask for divorce\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is prohibited for the husband to masturbate even if he does not ejaculate. That is a major sin in itself. To do that in the presence of the wife is even more serious and a greater sin.\n\nHowever, if that act leads the wife to resent the husband and that further leading to both not fulfilling one another?s marital rights, she may request a divorce from him.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
