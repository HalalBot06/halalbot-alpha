  "question": "Can you specify in what products Glycerin (from animal or plant) is Permissible i.e. Soaps, Lotions, shampoos, facial cleansers, etc.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamualikum Dear Mufti Sahab. In question 1070 some, you stated that Glycerin in products such as Soaps and Shampoos are permissible and you didn?t specify if from animal or plant is permissible so I assume that in non-edible products the Glycerin is permissible. Please correct me if I assumed wrong. I believe this because in question 3611 you stated that Glycerine is of 2 kinds; Plant and Animal. If it?s from animal it?s impermissible but from plant it?s ok in regards to the questions since it was about Toothpaste (edible). I was about to use an eye dropper medicine called Clear EyesÂ® but noticed it contained Glycerin 0.2 %. Can I use such eye treatment? Can you please clarify in what products we can use if it contains Glycerin( from animal or plant). I understand that all soaps and Shampoos containing Glycerin can be sued and permissible. Please elaborate in detail so I may understand. Jazaklallah khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSoaps and shampoos containing any type of glycerine are permissible. Your understanding that glycerine from animals is permissible in non-edible products is correct. The leniency is based on the principle of ?Umoom-e-Balwa? (public predicament)\n\nIt is generally difficult to abstain from soaps and shampoos having animal glycerine. As regards medicine containing animal glycerine, it will be permissible only if there is no adequate alternative.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
