  "answer": "QUESTION\nDid Hafiz Ibn Taimiyah Rahmatullah perform 20 rakat Taraweh? and did he also not allow masah over regular non-leather socks? Can you please give me the reference. I was having difficulty in finding it in Fatwa--Ibn Taiymiah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe do not know the opinions of Hafiz Taqi-u-ddin Ahmad ibn Taymiyyah in the enquired issues.\n\nShaykh Taqi-u-ddin Ahmad ibn Taymiyah was a prominent Aalim (scholar) of Deen. Shaykh Taqi-u-ddin had his independent views on many matters based on his vast knowledge and research. It is incorrect for non-scholars and non-academics to pass a judgment especially on such learned people. They should fear Allah and abstain from engaging themselves in such discussions. Differences of opinion is a salient feature among the Ulama-e-Haqq (true scholars).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
