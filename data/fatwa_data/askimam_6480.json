  "question": "Do plants and animals indulge in Zikr all the time? Any reference in terms of Qurâ€™an and Hadith to this? Also have you come across any scientific evidence of this?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy friend suggested that I keep a green plant in my house so that there is always ?someone? doing Zikr in the house when I am not, or when I am out.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAll the creations of Allah Ta'ala do the Dhikr of Allah Ta'ala. The Qur'aan\nmentions, 'And there is nothing except that it does the Tasbeeh\n(glorification) of Allah, but you (O man) do not understand its Tasbeeh.'\n\nThere is no need as such to acquire plants for this purpose, for if it was an\nact of virtue, the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) would have acquired plants\nfor this purpose.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
