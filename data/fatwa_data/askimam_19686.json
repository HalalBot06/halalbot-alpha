  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAnother incident of Jamaludeen – the minister of Bhopal\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nOnce he called his ministers and influential people to his house for dinner. At that time a toilet cleaner came to him and said that he wishes to accept Islam. Jamaluddin left all his work and immediately instructed his workers to prepare a bath and some clean clothes for the toilet cleaner. When all the arrangements were made, the worker presented the toilet cleaner to Jamaluddin. Jamaluddin instructed the worker to arrange a place for this person to eat. When Jamaluddin said this, the profile guests raised their eyes as if to say “what do you think you are doing, making a toilet cleaner sit with us?” Jamaluddin sensed this and said “Don’t worry, I won’t make him eat with you all, rather I shall sit and eat with him because there is no one purer than this person amongst us; he has just accepted Islam and all his sins have been forgiven. I will maximise this opportunity and eat with this pure person.”\n\n \n\nComments from Hadhrat Mufti Ebrahim Desai Sahib (daamat barakatuhum):\n\n \n\nHow do we measure a person, by his outward appearance and work or by his values?\n\n \n\nWhatever is our honest answer, that will determine the values by which we live!"
