  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1.\nI have started an online clothing shop, selling both gents and ladies shalwar kameez.\nIs it permissible to advertise for the shop in different magazine and newspaper where we advertise for the garments with male or female models? Modesty secured.\n\n2.\nWhat is the minimum requirement for male circumcision? How much foreskin should be removed? I am afraid that the doctor didn't removed enough, is there an easy way for a parent to determine a correct circumcision.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1.      There are two aspects to your query\n \n\n·        Advertising\n\n\n·        Role of the advertising newspaper/magazine\n\nIn principle, it is permissible to advertise once products/business if the advert contains nothing un Islamic. However, it is important to understand the philosophy of the advertising agent before placing an advert in any publication. It is a fact that newspapers and magazines depend heavily on adverts to finance their projects. In the recent past many companies have used their publications to insult and derogate our Nabi (sallallahu alayhi wassalam). Such companies should be boycotted and no Muslim should place any adverts in these publications. Furthermore, Muslims should avoid purchasing these publications as they have no regard and consideration to our feelings and beliefs.\n\n2.      The minimum requirement for the circumcision to be valid is that the glands penis be exposed ( Shaami Vol.6 Page 761).\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
