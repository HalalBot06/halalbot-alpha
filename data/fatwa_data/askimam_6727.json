  "question": "Can a person begin their fast while in a state of janabah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamu alaikum, Please could you answer the following question for me please: 1) If a person is in a state of janabah at suhoor time and does not do ghusl before sunrise and then proceeds to fast the following day in the month of Ramadhan and does ghusl later in the morning, is the fast valid? If this is wrong but the person did not realise they were doing wrong, what do they need to do to make up? 2) After childbirth if a woman continues to bleed for 3 months when does she need to start praying salat again and does she need to fast in Ramadhan if she continues to bleed? 3) Is it allowed for a woman to hold (without gloves) her husbands bare arms in public as they walk together if his arms are not covered by clothing? JazakAllah khairan. Wassalaam. Amin\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The fast is valid\n2. After 40 days from childbirth, she should commence performing Salaat and she may fast also. 3. The practice is against shame and modesty.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
