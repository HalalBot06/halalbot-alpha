  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it permissible for us to do ibadaath and perform nafil in the night of meraj like how we did for Shab-e-Qadr i.e lailathu Qadr, Please reply asap as the meraj is fastly approaching and i'm confused. .Aslo is it permissible to decorate masjid with lights in month of ramazaan and IDD's\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe days and nights of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) were filled with full of Barkaat and noor. If Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) physically ascended the skies during Me?raaj, almost every day, Jibraaeel (alayhis salaam) used to descend with many angels with revelation and guidance.%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) often participated in Jihaad and sacrificed for the upliftment of Deen. Many Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhu) were martyred. In brief, every moment of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) life was filled with amazing moments. Me?raaj is one of them. Allah has bestowed Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) with the gift of Salaat in this heavenly journey. However, in the remaining life of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), almost 13 years thereafter, he never ever celebrated Me?raaj. The Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) after Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) also did not celebrate Me?raaj.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe pious predecessors, among them, the four famous jurists, Imaam Abu Hanifa (RA), Imaam Shaafi?ee (RA), Imaam Maalik (RA) and Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (RA) did not celebrate Me?raaj either. The incident of Me?raaj is not to celabrate, rather it is to ponder upon the gift of Salaat and fulfil this great obligation. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?The first thing a person will be accounted for on the day of judgment will be Salat.? Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?The difference between Imaan and Kufr is leaving out Salaat.? To celebrate Me?raaj is Bid?at. Furthermore, it is senseless to celebrate Me?raaj while neglecting the obligation of Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0ATo decorate the Musjids during Ramadhaan and Eid is Bid?at. Such a practise should be abandoned.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
