  "question": "In The Name of Allah I need to know more about our relations with non-muslim family eg:my wife embraced islam in 1989,what if someone in her family dies,mother or father,can she attend the funaral.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan muslims make dua for non-muslims.Also all related issues I need answered.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is prohibited to attend the actual funeral of a non-Muslim. However, we\nshould not lose sight of our Islamic morals which strongly advise us to\nmaintain good family relations, even though that family may not be Muslim.\n\nIf a non-Muslim relative passes away, take out some time and visit the\nfamily, console them, share with them their grief and display the best of\ncharacter. However, the rules of Islam should not be compromised. Don't take\npart in any of the funeral activities, but find a quite time to visit and\npay your respect, etc. Remember, your displaying good character is one of\nthe strongest ways of bringing them closer to Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
