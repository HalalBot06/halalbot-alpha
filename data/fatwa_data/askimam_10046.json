  "answer": "QUESTION\nI release urine drops and I cant concentrate when I go to the toilet it takes forever as it just keeps coming out and I have to force myself to stop, when I pray I feel like I release urine drops not sure, as well and I cant keep cleaning my clothes and do wudu and istinja, thru out the day I have to do istinja wudu wash the underwear and it takes forever and it is making me very depressed, put paper there put still release urine so I do istinja and the same thing keeps happening\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nUrine drops after relieving oneself is a common problem. It is pointless to make an effort to release every drop of urine and in fact will cause pain and frustration. You should relieve yourself normally and wash thereafter. Sprinkle some water on your undergarment to avoid suspicion.\n\nThis is prescribed by Jibraeel(AS) for the Ummah. The mere feeling of urine drops should be ignored and attributed to the wetness of the undergarment. Be rest assured your wudhu is intact ad your salah is valid. There is no need for you to be depressed any further if you follow the above.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
