  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) Is it permissable for a female alima to answer queries by a male questioner about issues related to masturbation? What if there are NO male alims available at the institute? What if male alims are available?\n\n2) Is it permissable for a female alima to teach islamic classes to male students over the phone or internet? behind a curtain?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is not permissible for a strange male (ghair Mahram) to ask an Alima any question. Men should refer their questions to Ulama. If there are no Ulama available in ones locality, one should take advantage of technology and either telephone an Alim in another place. There are many competent Ulama that answer queries through their Q&A websites which you could make use off.\n\nShaytaan is our enemy and tries different ways to mislead us. Sometimes in the disguise of Deen Shaytaan injects his Haraam agendas. Although enquiring about Deen is a meritorious act, but in this case it is not permissible as there is a fear of falling into Haraam. The only exception is when Allah has blessed a woman with a type of knowledge that other men do not have or not capable off, then it would be permissible to seek that subject from an Alima. Hadrath Ayesha Radillahu Anha was a woman who Allah had blessed with the knowledge of the domestic life of Nabi (). It is common in the book of Ahadith, that the Sahabah enquired from her regarding this subject.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
