  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMy Respected Brother-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu Alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuh%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the spirit of Islamic brotherhood and in keeping with the Sunnah of our%0D%0ANabi Muhammad (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) who has said, 'None of you has%0D%0AImaan (Faith) until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself',%0D%0Aplease allow me to offer to you the following words of advice:%0D%0A%0D%0AEvery true believer living in this world fears the wrath and punishment of%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala. Are you safe, O my brother, from the punishment of Allah Ta'%0D%0Aala? The question each one of us has to ask himself is: Would you like to be%0D%0Aamongst those who will be punished tomorrow, on the day in which neither%0D%0Awealth nor children will be of any benefit except to that person who appears%0D%0Abefore Allah with a pure heart? Would you be happy if your soul were reduced%0D%0Ato the lowest position after Allah had created it in the best of forms?%0D%0AWould you allow myself to be disgraced in front of the whole of mankind and%0D%0Athe entire creation on the Day of Qiyaamah (Reckoning)? Certainly you would%0D%0Anot like any of this to happen to you!%0D%0A%0D%0APlease let me share with you some brotherly advice regarding just one evil%0D%0Athat has become so widespread today - especially amongst the youth. I know%0D%0Athat there may be many questions roving in your mind regarding this evil:%0D%0A%0D%0A* What is this sin?%0D%0A* Is it so grave that we should discuss it?%0D%0A* What is the solution to it?%0D%0A* How can we save ourselves from it?%0D%0A* What are the harms and consequences of it?%0D%0A%0D%0ADo not be too hasty for soon you will find answers to all your questions.%0D%0A%0D%0AMy Beloved Brother! You are certainly aware that the sin of homosexuality is%0D%0Aharaam. But do you know how serious this crime is and just how despicable it%0D%0Ais in the sight of Allah Ta'ala? Just imagine, my brother, that when it is%0D%0Aagainst the very nature of man, nay even of animals, what is the position of%0D%0Athe person who indulges in it! Is such a person unaware that Allah Ta'ala --%0D%0Ain all His Grandeur, Might and Power -- is watching him while he indulges in%0D%0Athis haraam act? Is he not aware that Allah Ta'ala has the power to send%0D%0Adown upon him a swift and severe punishment or even seize him while he is%0D%0Ainvolved in it? What will his position be when he appears before his Rabb%0D%0A(Sustainer) on the Day of Qiyaamah?%0D%0A%0D%0A\" And such is the grasp of your Rabb when He seizes a community while it%0D%0Atransgresses! Certainly His grasp is very painful.\" (Surah Hood, ayah 102)%0D%0A%0D%0ALet us now look at a few verses of the Qur'an, Ahaadith, narrations of the%0D%0ASahaabah (radhiallaahu anhum) and sayings and verdicts of the Ulama%0D%0Aregarding the sin of homosexuality or sodomy. Thereafter, let us see what%0D%0Aare some of the diseases that spread as a result of it as well as some%0D%0Asolutions. May Allah Ta'ala grant us the ability to follow His guidance and%0D%0Athe Sunnah of His Beloved Nabi Muhammad (sallallahu alayhi wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0ABEWARE!%0D%0A%0D%0AOur beloved Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said, 'Certainly the%0D%0Athing I fear most on my ummah is the (wicked) practice of the people of%0D%0ALoot.' (Tirmizi, Ahmad, Ibn Hajr Al-Haysami, Ad-Duri and Al-Aajuri) (Hadith%0D%0AHasan)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadrat Ali bin Abi Taalib (RA) relates, 'Whoever allows himself to be used%0D%0Asexually (by becoming a homosexual or sodomite), Allah Ta'ala will expel%0D%0Afrom him the (natural) desire for women.'%0D%0A%0D%0ANajeeb As-Sirri (AR) says, 'They (i.e. our pious elders) would even dislike%0D%0Alooking at handsome young boys'%0D%0A%0D%0AOnce Abul Aswad (AR) brought a letter which he showed to one of his students%0D%0Aand said, ' I bear witness that this letter was dictated by Ali bin Abi%0D%0ATaalib (RA) to Abul Aswad: When men (i.e. homosexuals) will sexually satisfy%0D%0Athemselves with men and women (i.e. lesbians) with women, then earthquakes%0D%0Awill occur, faces will become transformed and stones will rain down from the%0D%0Askies.'%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) has also said \"May Allah curse him%0D%0Awho does what the people of Loot (alayhis salaam) did.\" (Ibn Hibbaan)%0D%0A%0D%0AHe (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) has also said, 'Lesbianism by women is%0D%0Aadultery between them.' (Tabraani)%0D%0A%0D%0AA LESSON FROM HISTORY%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is a well-known fact that when this wretched disease spread among one%0D%0Anation in the past, Allah Ta'ala caused punishments to rain down from the%0D%0Askies upon them. Allah mentions their story in many places in the Qur'an. At%0D%0Aone place, He says,%0D%0A%0D%0A\"And (We also sent) Loot (as a Messenger). 'Behold, he said to his people,%0D%0Ado you do what is shameful even though you see (that it is wrong)? Would you%0D%0Areally approach men in your lusts rather than women? Nay, you are a grossly%0D%0Aignorant people!'%0D%0A%0D%0ABut his people gave no other answer but this: They said, 'Drive out the%0D%0Afollowers of Loot from your city. These are indeed men who want to be clean%0D%0Aand pure!'%0D%0A%0D%0ABut We saved him and His family except his wife: We destined her to be of%0D%0Athose who lagged behind.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd We rained down on them a shower (of stones). And evil was the shower on%0D%0Athose who were admonished (but failed to heed).\" (Surah an-Naml, 54-58)%0D%0A%0D%0AAt yet another place, Allah Most High says: Do you approach the males of%0D%0Ahumanity, leaving the wives Allah has created for you? But you are a people%0D%0Awho transgress. (Surah ash-Shu'raa: 165 &166)%0D%0A%0D%0A%3EFrom the first aayah, we learn that these people had themselves admitted%0D%0Athat the family of Loot (AS) who had Imaan (belief in Allah) was decent,%0D%0Achaste and morally pure. They also acknowledged that the family of Loot (AS)%0D%0Arefrained from this filthy practice. They realised this since it is natural%0D%0Afor every person to immediately recognise the pure way of life inspired by%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala when they see it and also to make out any type of unnatural and%0D%0Aperverted behaviour.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the Tafseer (commentary) of these verses it is mentioned that the people%0D%0Aof Loot (AS) were practicing both homosexuality and lesbianism. When Allah%0D%0Adecided to punish them, He commanded Jibraeel (AS) to lift the village of%0D%0ALoot (AS) to the extent that the angels of the first heaven (sky) could%0D%0Aactually hear the barking of their dogs. Jibraeel then turned them over and%0D%0Adropped them from this tremendous height. Thereafter, Allah Ta'ala caused sc%0D%0Aorching hot stones to rain down upon them. This is how this nation ended up%0D%0Abeing an example for the rest of mankind until the Day of Qiyaamah.%0D%0A%0D%0AImaam Al-Aajuri (AR) has said, 'Allah Ta'ala has informed you about the%0D%0Adespicable act of homosexuality committed by the people of Loot (AS) and how%0D%0AHe punished them by first snatching away their eyesight. Jibraeel (AS) was%0D%0Athen instructed to uproot their cities with all the inhabitants until they%0D%0Awere high up into the sky and then turn over their cities upon them.%0D%0AThereafter they were pelted with stones of clay.' Such was their punishment%0D%0Athat not a single citizen or traveller could save himself from the stones%0D%0Aand from being completely destroyed.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is said that they were four million in number. (Tafseer Ibn Katheer p.471%0D%0Avol. 2)%0D%0A%0D%0ALet us reflect! Why did Allah Ta'ala punish them so severely in such a%0D%0Amanner that He had never punished any other nation before? Surely their sin%0D%0Amust have been really serious for Allah Ta'ala to have punished and%0D%0Adestroyed them in this way.%0D%0A%0D%0ADISGRACE IN THIS WORLD%0D%0A%0D%0AThe acts of homosexuality and lesbianism are certainly a perversion and a%0D%0Aserious deviation from the inherent nature of man. These acts of defiance%0D%0Aagainst human nature are also even viler and uglier than adultery. There is%0D%0Aconsensus among both Muslims and the followers of other religions that%0D%0Alesbianism and homosexuality are evil and filthy practices. This is why it%0D%0Ais not surprising to find that Islam so vehemently prohibits it and adopts%0D%0Asuch a harsh attitude against it.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe punishment awaiting such people in the Hereafter has already been%0D%0Aexplained, but what about their punishment in this world?%0D%0A%0D%0ASince such type of behaviour was previously totally unknown to the Arab%0D%0Apeople, there is no record of any such incident having occurred during the%0D%0Atime of Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) or that he was faced with a%0D%0Acase of this nature. However, it has been confirmed that Rasulullah%0D%0A(sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said,%0D%0A%0D%0A'Kill the one who sodomizes and the one to who lets it be done to him.'%0D%0A(Tirmizi)%0D%0A%0D%0ASayyiduna Abu Bakr (RA) had passed such a ruling and Hadrat Ali (RA) was%0D%0Avery severe in his ruling against such a crime. It is established that once%0D%0ASayyiduna Khaalid bin Waleed (RA) found a man in the frontiers of Arabia%0D%0Amarrying another man in the way a woman marries a man, so he wrote about it%0D%0Ato Abu Bakr (RA). When Abu Bakr (RA) consulted with the Sahaabah, Ali (RA)%0D%0Awho was the severest in his condemnation of it said, 'Only one out of the%0D%0Amany nations had indulged in it and you all know how Allah Ta'ala had dealt%0D%0Awith them. I feel that he should be destroyed by fire.' So Abu Bakr (RA)%0D%0Awrote back to Sayyiduna Khaalid (RA) who then put the man to death by means%0D%0Aof fire.%0D%0A%0D%0AIbn Qassaar and Ibn Taymiyyah (AR) have said: All the Sahaabah (radhiallaahu%0D%0Aanhum) were unanimous that he should be killed though some of them differed%0D%0Ain the manner in which it should be done.%0D%0A%0D%0AAbu Bakr (RA) said that he should be executed by being thrown from a great%0D%0Aheight.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnother view of Hadrat Ali (RA) was that a wall should be dropped upon him.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadrat Ibn Abbaas, Ali, Jaabir bin Zaid, Abdullah bin Ma`mar, Imaam Zuhri%0D%0Aand Imaam Maalik (radhiallaahu anhum) have said that those who commit the%0D%0Aevil deed of the people of Loot (AS) should be stoned to death, whether they%0D%0Abe married or unmarried. This is also one of the narrations of Imaams Ahmad,%0D%0AShaafi`ee and Abu Sawr (AR).%0D%0A%0D%0AHadrat Ibn Abbaas (RA) was once asked about the punishment for the%0D%0Ahomosexual. He replied, 'He should be taken to the top of the highest%0D%0Abuilding in the town and thrown headlong from there. Then he should be%0D%0Apelted with stones.'%0D%0A%0D%0AJaabir bin Zaid used to say, 'The prohibitive decree of the anus is far more%0D%0Aserious than the prohibitive decree of the vagina.' In other words, the%0D%0Aprohibition against anal intercourse is far more severe than the prohibition%0D%0Aagainst illegitimate sexual intercourse (with a woman).%0D%0A%0D%0AITS DANGERS IN THIS WORLD%0D%0A%0D%0AAmong the evil consequences of this sin are the many deadly and contagious%0D%0Adiseases that result from it. Some of these illnesses are such that medical%0D%0Ascience -- with all its might, power and advanced technology - has failed to%0D%0Acombat or even fully comprehend, let alone cure it. Certainly no one is able%0D%0Ato rise above the Will of Allah Ta'ala and escape his wrath!%0D%0A%0D%0ASome of these fatal diseases are:%0D%0A%0D%0A* AIDS: There is no cure for it. It is contracted and spread through%0D%0Aunlawful sexual intercourse and perverted sexual acts like homosexuality.%0D%0A%0D%0A* GONORRHEA: which causes inflammation of the testicles, blockage of the%0D%0Aurethra, inflammation of the joints and sterility.%0D%0A%0D%0A* SYPHILIS: This is a type of venereal disease commonly known among the%0D%0AArabs as 'the English Disease' since its origin lies in European societies%0D%0Awhere free intermingling of the sexes and immorality is rife. It results in%0D%0Ainsanity, paralysis, blindness, and other nerve disorders. Also leads to%0D%0Ablood vessel damage and death.%0D%0A%0D%0A* GENITAL ULCERS: which causes inflammation of the lymphatic glands. It also%0D%0Agives rise to chronic festering of tumours, inflammation of the urethra,%0D%0Asevere pain in the joints and swelling of the limbs.%0D%0A%0D%0A* HEPATITIS B: Its symptoms include fever, fatigue, nausea and jaundice. It%0D%0Aresults in chronic hepatitis or liver cancer.%0D%0A%0D%0AThese are only a few of the many deadly diseases caused by perverted sexual%0D%0Abehaviour. Could anyone ever desire contracting any of them?%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala protect all of us from all types of evil!%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE WAY TO SALVATION!%0D%0A%0D%0AMy Beloved Brother! Practicing on complete Islam is certainly the key to our%0D%0Asuccess in this world and the Hereafter. Islam has provided us with the%0D%0Asolution to problems in every sphere of our lives. Without doubt, the road%0D%0Ato saving ourselves is simple and as clear as daylight -- and it is to keep%0D%0Aourselves far away from this grievous sin.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe following are some means that will help you to do this:%0D%0A%0D%0ADo towbah (i.e. repent sincerely) to Allah and turn to Him.%0D%0AStay away from the company of evil people or friends who glamorize and%0D%0Aglorify those deeds and things that are sinful and make them appeal to you.%0D%0AThe company that the youth keep plays the greatest role in either reforming%0D%0Aor corrupting them. Therefore, choose for yourself the company of righteous%0D%0Apeople who will be of help and benefit to you in the matters of your Deen%0D%0A(Religion) and your dunya (worldly affairs)%0D%0ATurn yourself and your gaze away from all those things that arouse the%0D%0Apassions, like looking at and staying in the company of beardless, young%0D%0Alads or even pictures of them of which films, magazines, etc are brimming.%0D%0AMake every effort to get married in order to remain pure and chaste and%0D%0Arespond to the call of our beloved Nabi (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) who has%0D%0Asaid, 'O Assembly of Youth! Those of you who have the means to get married,%0D%0Ashould do so. And whoever is unable to do so, must keep fast. For this is%0D%0Acertainly a protection for him.' (Bukhaari, Muslim)%0D%0AFast in abundance in order to suppress the carnal desires%2Fpassions. Our%0D%0ARasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) has said,' Certainly shaitaan flows%0D%0Ain (the body of) man like the flowing of blood. So, subdue him by keeping%0D%0Afast.' (Sahih Bukhaari: vol.1 p.273 Book of Fasting)%0D%0ASpend your spare time in those activities that will benefit you because the%0D%0Amind of an idle person becomes the target of sinful thoughts whispered by%0D%0Ashaitaan and your nafs (the self which commands a person to do evil).%0D%0AAND FINALLY.MY DEAR BROTHER, O YOUTH!%0D%0A%0D%0AWhat is the person who indulges in this evil, waiting for? Is he waiting for%0D%0Athe moment when death will suddenly overtake him while he is busy committing%0D%0Athis sin? Has he given any thought to the condition of his father who had%0D%0Aworked so hard to earn a living in order to bring him up and to see to his%0D%0Aneeds? How proud his father used to be of him, when he was a little boy,%0D%0Awhenever he attended any gatherings! Has he thought about the condition of%0D%0Ahis mother who spent long, restless nights awake for the sake of his%0D%0Acomfort? Is he now going to repay them with shame and disgrace them in front%0D%0Aof everyone?%0D%0A%0D%0AOr, is he waiting for death to overtake him while he is in the act of this%0D%0Adespicable sin? Death certainly does not fix a time with us nor does it%0D%0Apostpone its arrival for anyone, whether young or old!%0D%0A%0D%0AMy dear brother, this precious life is a special gift from our Beloved%0D%0ACreator, Allah to us so that we may perform virtuous deeds and gain His%0D%0Apleasure. In fact, the principal motive behind everything that we do should%0D%0Abe the pleasure of Allah -- and this is the real meaning of success. Allah%0D%0Atells us:%0D%0A%0D%0ABut the pleasure of Allah is the highest achievement: This is the greatest%0D%0Asuccess. (Surah at-Tawbah: 72)%0D%0A%0D%0AOur life in this world is also a test from Allah. He has placed us in this%0D%0Aworld and created certain desires within us. But He has not made this world%0D%0Athe place for the fulfillment of our desires. Here, we must fill our hearts%0D%0Awith the fear of Allah and suppress our own desires and give priority to the%0D%0Awishes and orders of Allah over our own desires. In return for this, our%0D%0AAllah has promised to reward us with Jannah, the everlasting place of%0D%0Aindescribable beauty and happiness that He has reserved for us in the%0D%0AAakhirah.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd for them who had feared standing before their Rabb (Sustainer) (on the%0D%0ADay of Qiyaamah) and had restrained (their) soul from lower desires,%0D%0A%0D%0ACertainly Jannah will be their abode. (Surah an- Naazi'aat: 40,41)%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd since Jannah has been created as the actual place for the satisfaction%0D%0Aof all our desires, everything there will be according to our wishes. Allah%0D%0Apromises:%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0ATherein shall you have all that your souls shall desire; therein shall you%0D%0Ahave all that you ask for! A hospitable gift from One Oft-Forgiving, Most%0D%0AMerciful! (Surah Fussilat: 31,32)%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AIn conclusion, my dear brother, I hope I have been able to illustrate%0D%0Aclearly, yet briefly, the Islamic view regarding this sin and some of its%0D%0Aharms so that it may serve as an eye -opener for those not involved in it%0D%0Aand a means of earnestly repenting to Allah Ta'ala for those who have fallen%0D%0Ainto the trap of shaitaan.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is now your duty, my beloved brother, to inform each and every youth of%0D%0Athe sinfulness of this vice and its dangers and earn abundant reward from%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala.%0D%0A%0D%0AI ask Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Powerful to grant all of us the ability%0D%0Ato turn to Him in repentance, and to make what I have written and you have%0D%0Aread, a witness in our favour and not against us.%0D%0A%0D%0AFor Allah alone grants the Muslims the ability to do what is beneficial for%0D%0Athem.%0D%0A"
