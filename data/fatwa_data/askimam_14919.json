  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nif a person misses the first 3 rakaats of dhur salaah / after the salaam he has to repeat the 3 rakaatsÂ  understood\n\nmy question is in which of the 3 rakaats doess he read sura fatiha and a sura and in which of the 3 rakaats does he only read sura fahiha\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIn the first two rakats of the missed rakats, recite sura Fatiha and a sura. In the third rakat, recite only sura Fatiha.\n\nIt is important to point out that as a principle, one must sit after every two rakats. Therefore, when one stands up to read the first missed rakat, he should sit down in Tashahud as he has completed two rakats. That is the one rakat behind the Imam and the one rakat he performes by himself.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
