  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI saw in one of the website where in many places they have used the word damat barakatuhu. Kindly can you give evidence with regards to this from Quran and Hadith only.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nThe words “daamat barakatuhu” essentially mean “(may) his blessings be lasting”. These words are a dua which is usually said after the name of a pious person who is living.\n\nThis dua is not established from the Quran and Hadith and it is not necessary to say it after mentioning the name of a pious person. However, it is a beneficial dua for all Muslims as we ask Allah Ta’ala to keep the example, influence, and perhaps the teachings of the pious person lasting for all so that the Ummah may benefit and be guided properly.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\nMl. Asif Umar,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
