  "question": "Is Laser Hair Removal allowed in Islam if done by a female to a female?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf your query is about pubic hair, it would not be permissible since this will entail a female looking into the private part of another female. This is not permissible according to the Shari?ah.\n\nIf your question relate to those hair which you can remove, e.g. moustaches, beard, etc. then in this specific situation, it will be permissible. However, it is not permissible for female to trim/cut hair of the head.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
