  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf a person has had an operation and they find they keep releasing blood and urine constantly from the penis, Is it possible for them to read namaz?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf the person is unable to perform two rakats salah without the urine and blood coming out, then he will be mazoor (an excused person). The ruling for an excused person is he should perform wudhu when the salah time sets in. The wudhu will be valid for the entire salah time inspite of the urine and blood coming out. When the salah time expires, then the wudhu too will expire. A fresh wudhu will have to be made for the new salaah time.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
