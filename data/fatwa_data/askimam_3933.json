  "question": "Assalaamu Alaikum Mufti Saheb,Why is donating one's organs after death forbidden?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn a prior ruling you stated: \"the bequest (Wasiyyat) of a person that after his death, his organs be donated is forbidden in Shariah\". Please give the explanation for this ruling from the Qur'an and Sunnah. Jazak Allah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Islamic Fiqh Academy of India, during its Second Fiqh Seminar, held%0D%0Abetween 8-11 December 1989 at the Hamdard Convention Centre, New Delhi,%0D%0AIndia, resolved that if a person directed that after one's death one's organ%0D%0Ashould be used for the purpose of transplantation (testamentary disposition,%0D%0Aas is commonly known), it would not be considered as wasiyyah (will)%0D%0Aaccording to Shari'ah. (\"Islamic Fiqh Academy of India - Developing A%0D%0AReligious Law in Modern Times\" in Religion and Law Review, op. Cit., p. 330)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe plausible factors%2Fconsiderations that may have influenced the adoption%0D%0Aof this negative resolution pertain firstly to the concept of human organ%0D%0Abeing regarded as an amanah (trust endowed to every human being by the%0D%0ACreator) and secondly to the stance that human organ is invaluable.%0D%0A%0D%0AA. Human Organ: An Amanah%0D%0AAs discussed in chapter ix, there are Muslim jurists who regard the human%0D%0Abody (including its parts) as an amaanah (trust). Therefore, since a human%0D%0Abeing does not own his body, he%2Fshe cannot make a gift in respect of any%0D%0Apart of his%2Fher body either during his%2Fher lifetime or after death. Thus to%0D%0Ainclude organ donation in one's will would not be in order since one cannot%0D%0Agive away that which one does not legally own.%0D%0A%0D%0AB. Human Organ: Invaluable%0D%0AThe testator's estate is termed in Arabic as mal mutaqawwam (asset upon%0D%0Awhich a price can be set for it). Muslim jurists are of the opinion that a%0D%0Ahuman being's person (organs included) is mal ghayr mutaqawwam (invaluable%0D%0Ai.e. no price can be set for it). (Tanzil-ur-Rahmaan. A Code of Muslim%0D%0APersonal Law. North Nazimabad, Karachi. Islamic Publishers. 1980, vol. 2 p.%0D%0A330). Thus it logically follows that since no price can be set for human%0D%0Aorgan, the inclusion of its donation into one's will would be regarded as%0D%0Anull and void.%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the book, 'Organ Transplantation - Contemporary Islamic Legal and%0D%0AThical Perspectives', Abul Fadl Mohsin Ebrahim.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
