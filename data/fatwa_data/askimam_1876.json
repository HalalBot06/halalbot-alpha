  "question": "Why does a shia person while saying his prayers do sajda on a mor (khakh e shafa or turbat)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe practice of the shias of making sajdah on a turbat is based on their\nreverence of the land of Karbala where Hadhrat Husain (Radhiyallahu unhu)\nwas martyred. Their practice is erroneous and unfounded in the Shariah.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
