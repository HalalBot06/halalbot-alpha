  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am from a Middle Class Family. I have a Sister, and She will be marrying in the Next Year. My Family depends on my Money. It doesn't mean that they dont have Money for their Daily Expenses. But they want to Save some Money for my Sisters Marriage.\n\nMy Question is.\n\nOne of My Non-Muslim Friend is suffering for Day - Day Expenses. I have the Intention of making him to be converted to Islam, Insha Allah in the future.\n\n Is it allowed for me to Provide Him Money rather than Providing Money to My Family (for few days unless he settles down).\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIf your family needs you to help them with the expenses of the wedding, then you should try to help Insha Allah.\n\nHowever, if they are not in dire need of your financial aid, then explain to them that you know someone who is inclined to accepting Islam and that you are helping him financially until he is able to support himself. Tell them that you are doing this so that Insha Allah, you have hope that he would embrace Islam.\n\nIf they understand that your intention is noble, perhaps they too would assist him if they can.\n\nMay Allah make this easy for you and grant your friend to embrace this beautiful Deen, Ameen.\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl.
