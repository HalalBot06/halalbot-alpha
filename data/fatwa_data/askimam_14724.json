  "question": "DID IMAM ABU HANIFA(MAY THE MERCY OF ALLAH BE UPON HIM) TAKE BAYAT TO ANY SHEIKH IF NOT WHY NOT",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nASSALAMU-ALIKUM. MAY ALLAH REWARD YOU FOR YOUR EXCELLENT CONTRIBUTION TO ISLAM..\n\nMY QUESTION IS : DID IMAM ABU HANIFA(MAY THE MERCY OF ALLAH BE UPON HIM) TAKE BAYAT TO ANY SHEIKH IF NOT WHY NOT. OR DID ANY OF HIS STUDENTS TAKE BAYAT TO HIM AS A SPIRITUAL GUIDE.\n\nMAY Allah REWARD YOU.\n\nMOHAMMED\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nBismihi Ta’ala\n\n \n\nImam Abu Hanifa (Rahimahullah)was born in the year 80 Hijri during the era of the Khilafat of Abdul Malik Ibn Marwaan who,thereafter was succeeded by Abu Ja’far Al Mansoor.In an Islamic country it is incumbent upon all the muslims of that particular country that they take bay’ah to the khalifa of the time.We understand from this that Imam Abu Hanifa (Rahimahullah)was bay’ah to these two Khalifa’s.\n\n \n\nHowever,Imam Abu Hanifa (Rahimahullah)did not take spiritual guidance from these two personalities.Rather he gained his spiritual guidance from many illustrious Tabi’een, namely; Makhool,Ikrimah,Abdullah Ibn Dinaar and many others(Rahmatullahi Alaihim Ajma’een).Imam Abu Hanifa (Rahimahullah)did not take bayah to any of these spiritual guides as he was already bay’ah to the khalifa’s of his time.\n\n \n\nThe students of Imam Abu Hanifa (Rahimahullah)such as Abu Yusuf, Muhammad and Zufar (Rahmatullahi Alaihim Ajmaeen),were also bay’ah to the khalifa of the time.Nevertheless there is no doubt that their spiritual guide was Imam Abu Hanifa (Rahimahullah)as they had devoted their lives in his company.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala Knows Best.\n\n \n\nMl.Suhail Tarmahomed\n\nStudent:Darul Ifta\n\n \n\nChecked and approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
