You state that your friends are aware that you get bothered by them referring to their wives and they deliberately refer to their wives to bother you. Now that you know that, you should know the solution to that. Do not react or show any emotions to your friends when they refer to their wives.\n\n2. In principle, it is not permissible for a male to greet a Ghayr Mahram (not prohibited in marriage) female as that may lead to Fitnah. However, in practice you should apply wisdom and conduct yourself in a way that you are conscious of the purpose of Shariâ€™ah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
