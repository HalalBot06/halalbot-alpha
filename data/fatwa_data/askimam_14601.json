  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamu allikum,\n\nMy father is an alcoholic. My whole family is aware of that but no one seems to guide him or tell him that it is big sin. i found out about it couple of years ago. Mufit sahib, that he hurt me alot and i dont seem to have any respect for him.Please guide me on what to do and how to deal with the situation. When he goes to pakistan he drinks in his room while my younger siblings are in the other room.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nIt is Fardh for you to respect your father even though he is an alcoholic. The pain of the bad habit is understood. You should approach your father when he is sober and advise him. Be very polite to him and offer him all the necessary assistance and support he needs to give up the habit. You have to bear and tolerate, if you want to assist your father. There is no compromise in respecting your father.  \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
