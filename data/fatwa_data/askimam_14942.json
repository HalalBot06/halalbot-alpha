  "question": "Is it true that what starts haram ends haram, and what starts halal ends halal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a question regarding marriage. Is it true that what starts haram ends haram, and what starts halal ends halal? If a person had a relationship with someone and wants to marry them... is it possible for this haram to become halal by ending it fully and do it the halal way, with no contact what so ever with this person? If this is done.. can they get married...will this have an effect later on their kids and will their life become miserable together?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe world is a place of cause and effect. Similarly good deeds have a positive effect on an individual and likewise bad deeds has its repercussions. Allah states “Whoever does good deeds (male and female) while they believe, Allah will bless them with a comfortable life”. Allah states in another verse “Whoever turns away from my commands, we will inflict him with a stricken life”.\n\nIt is clear that the effects of deeds do have a bearing on a person. You state that you were involved in a Haraam relation and have repented for the past. Allah is Most Forgiving and Merciful. Your past actions will not affect the validity of your Nikah to the same woman. If you have made sincere Tawbah, the children will not be harmed due to your past actions.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
