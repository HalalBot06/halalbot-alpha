  "question": "heard a tafseer from the holy Quran shareef that if our good deeds exceed even an atom more than our sins then and only then will we enter jannah and vice versa",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have read quite a few responses on your site regarding no matter how big the sin, if we make tawbah and repent to never repeat the mistake that inshallah Allah will forgive us and let us enter jannah. I also heard a tafseer from the holy Quran shareef that if our good deeds exceed even an atom more than our sins then and only then will we enter jannah and vice versa, also that we will be punished for our sins no matter what? Which one is true? Thanks\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nTo commit a sin be it minor or major is a severe offense in Islam. Allah Ta’ala has created man solely for his worship and has cautioned him about the plot of Nafs and Shaytaan. Allah warns man in the Qur’aan, ‘Verily Shaytaan is your enemy, so treat him as an enemy.’ (Faatir Aayat6)\n\nBy a person committing any sin, it is indeed a great injustice towards His creator who has blessed him with so many favours. This thought itself that Allah has blessed us with so many favours should deter a person from committing any sin. It is the right of Allah to take man to task for any and every sin he commits and reward him for every good deed. If Allah punishes a person on account of his misdeed or rewards him for his good deeds, it is pure and true justice. Hence, if Allah enters a person into paradise because of his good deeds exceeding his bad deeds by merely an atom’s weight or punishes a person because of his bad deeds exceeding his good deeds by merely an atom’s weight, it is in complete conformity to justice.\n\nAllah Ta’ala has the qualities of anger and mercy. Allah Ta’ala punishes his servants and also shows mercy. However, the quality of Allah’s mercy supercedes His anger. Allah Ta’ala states, ‘Inform my servants that I am the Most forgiving, Most Merciful and that also My punishment is a very painful punishment.’ (Hijr Aayat49-50)\n\nWhenever a person commits a sin, immediately the wrath and anger is directed towards him. However, as soon as he sincerely repents and begs Allah for forgiveness, the mercy of Allah supercedes and dominates His wrath and Allah Ta’ala forgives this person. Allah mentions in a Hadith, ‘Verily, my mercy supercedes my wrath.’\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
