  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)Your answers to 2737 and 1175 contradict your more recent answers to 5517 and 6175. 2)Q 5517 refers to videos of prayers in Mecca where the people are filmed reading salah. Please comment on this. 3)What about ultrasound pictures and videos of an unborn baby?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Ulama differ in their opinions regarding the images that appear on TV\nand videos.\n\nAccording to many reliable Ulama like Mufti Taqi Usmani Saheb, that is not\nstrictly Tasweer (picture making) as it is not in durable form - refer\nalbalagh.net Many other reliable Ulama do not differentiate between an image\nbeing durable or not. Hence, images on TV and videos is Tasweer and\nprohibited. It is, therefore, best to exercise precaution and abstain from\nany form of electronic capturing of animate picture.\n\nHowever, in view of the differences of opinion, there is a leeway only in\nthe case of dire need, for example, to expose massacre and oppression\nagainst Muslims. That is not so in using a video for entertainments like in\nmarriage ceremonies and parties.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
