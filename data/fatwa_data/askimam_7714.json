  "answer": "QUESTION\nWINE\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour question is unclear, whether you are employed by the wine company or not.\n\nAccording to our understanding, you are not employed and you merely live in such a place. If our understanding is correct, then you may continue living there. You will not be responsible for the importing of the wine. You should, however, guard yourself against the evils of wine in every possible way.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
