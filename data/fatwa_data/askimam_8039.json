  "question": "Can you please interpret the following dream and give some advice? If one has a dream in which there are taking a shower does it have any meaning? This has occured 3 times",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) If one has a dream in which there are taking a shower does it have any meaning? This has occured 3 times, the first dream I was taking ghusl, the other two were showers. 2) Do you know any method for getting rid of fame and pride? e.g. As you know the intention is very important and sometimes even though I know I am doing only for ALLAH Ta'ala I get the feeling that my intention is not correct and afterwards I have to fight off the ill thoughts.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen making Ghusl or taking a shower, one is cleansed. May Allah Ta?ala grant us the Tawfeeq (ability) to cleanse ourselves from external as well as internal impurities.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is encouraging to note that you enquire about ridding yourself from fame and pride. Both, fame and pride, are interlinked. A famous wishes to become famous because he assumes he is big and has the right to be known by all. The solution for that is to reflect on one?s shortcomings and consider the consequences if those shortcomings are exposed to people. Who will look at me? Who will respect me? People will look down upon me?etc. At this point, one will realize that it is better to be unknown than being popular and famous. Also remember, the more famous one becomes, he tightens the belt around himself. He has to be careful for everything he does as he is the ?lime light?. People watch such a person very closely and criticize him as well. Don?t worry about becoming famous. If one has valuable qualities, Allah will expose that to people. The popularity at that time will be with respect and honour. %0D%0A%0D%0AAlso ponder on one?s inception, a drop of impure water who was helpless for a long time, while in the womb of the mother and after birth. Ponder upon what is one?s system and what comes out when relieving. Is the bad odour and impurities within oneself not sufficient to make one understand his%2Fher worth? Especially when our end result is soil when we die and are buried to be resurrected on the day of Judgment to be judgement by Ahkamul Haakimeen (the best of Judges) who is sincere and who was worthy of any fame or not.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
