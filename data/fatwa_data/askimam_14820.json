  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have recently gone through a phase in my life where I have gotten a lot more religious than what I use to be. Now, I limit all contact with women, pray 5 times a day on time, lower my gaze, recite Qu’ran whenever I have time, among other changed. During this change, I broke up with my girlfriend, who is also Muslim, in hopes of trying to stop our haram relationship. However, no matter how hard we try, we cannot keep out of our relationship since we are deeply in love. We have tried to limit our interaction to once or twice a month but we however do kiss, hug and touch each other. In hopes of making this relationship Halal, I wanted to do Nikkah with her and she agrees. However, there is a chance that we will get divorced down the line sometime. This decision is to hard to make since I don’t want to keep doing haram with her but I also know divorce is not looked upon well. Which is more important and is better to do? Jazak Allah Khayr ya Akhi\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYou should make Nikah with the person and work towards a strong bond and sustained Nikah.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
