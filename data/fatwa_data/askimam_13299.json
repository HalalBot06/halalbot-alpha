  "question": "I accidentally entered her anus",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy wife and I were in the shower together and I accidentally entered her anus. It was not intentional at all and I removed it straight away and we did not repeat the act. Our niyyat was pure so are we accountable for this; should we make tawbah for the accident but it is still a big ghuna or not so in this case? Jazak-Allah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYou should repent for this and never repeat that in future. Also, avoid such circumstances that will lead you to such an accident.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
