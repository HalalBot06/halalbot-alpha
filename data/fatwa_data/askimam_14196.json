  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)Sometimes I come from intensive sports and the time for prayer has already started what should I do, first take a bath (ie retarding the prayer) or pray first? 2)What should we do if we weren't able to pray 'Asr salaat and the time for maghrib is in about 15 minutes, can we still pray 'asr? 3)Should we recite dua-e-qunoot in every witr? Moreover what is the complete du'a which begin by \"Allahumahdinni fi man hadayta wa afinni...\" because I know this du'a with two different endings. Please post the entire and the right one, jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. At the outset, it is important to note that if sporting activities becomes a means of you missing Salaah, it will not be permissible for you to engage in those sports. We believe in Allah. He is our Master and we are His slaves. Allah has ordered us to perform Salaah in its prescribed time, which we are bound to perform. It is against the spirit of servitude to ignore the command of the master. Allah, the Master of the entire world calls to Salaah, yet on trivial excuses Salaah is made Qadha and missed. Sporting is no genuine excuse to delay Salaah. The first question on the Day of Judgment will be regarding Salaah. If one is successful in this question, he/she will be successful in all the questions that follow. However, if one fails in this question, the remaining questions will be much more difficult until he/she will be flung headlong into the fire of hell. Therefore, you should be extremely cautious that while engaged in sporting activities, you do not become unmindful of your Salaah. The intensity of your sporting activities gives no leniency for you to even delay your Salaah. Salaah is Fardh (obligatory) while the sport is merely an entertainment.\n\n2. If the time of Maghrib has set in, then you should perform the Maghrib first and thereafter make the Qadha for the Asr.\n\n3. Dua ê Qunoot must be recited in third rakaat of Witr Salaah. The Dua starts with Allahuma Inna Nastaiynuka Wanastakhfiruka ….. The Dua that you have mentioned is recited by the adherents of the Shaafi Madhab.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai\nStudent: Darul Ifta\n\nChecked and Approved: Mufti Emraan Vawda"
