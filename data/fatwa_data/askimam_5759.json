  "question": "I would Like to Know More about The Greatest Name Of Allah(swt)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDoes this Name Hold Any Powers! For example, [ One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: \"I will bring it to you within the twinkling of an eye!\"..] Is it Possiable that the Man used this Name in Prayer to do this mirical! Jazaka'Laha Khair!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is stated in several Ahaadith that whatever prayer is made after the\nrecitation of Ismul-A'zam it is granted by Allah Ta'ala. However, scholars\ndiffer in specifying the Ismul-A'zam. These differences of opinion are\nblessings in disguise. Hereunder are the difference views.\n1. Wa ilaahukum ilaahuw waahid . (Baqarah)\n2. Aayatul Kursi\n3. Inna rabbakumullaaahu . muhsineen (A'araaf)\n4. Last 3 Aayaats of Surah Hashr\n\nAllamah Shaami (RA) has quoted Imaam Abu Hanifa (RA) as saying that the\nIsmul A'zam is the name, 'Allah'. Leader of saints, Shaykh Abdul-Qaadir\nJailaaniy, is also of the same view provided that at the time of reciting\nthe word, Allah, there is nothing but Allah in his mind. Some Sufis say it\nshould be recited in such a state of mind which is comparable to that of a\ndrowning person when there is nobody to help him and he calls Allah for help\nwith extreme sincerity.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
