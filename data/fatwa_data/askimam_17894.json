  "question": "Is reading novels allowed in islam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nis reading novels allowed in islam?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nIn principle, it is permissible to read novels and other literature provided that the contents are in conformity with the Sharī'ah and Islāmic etiquettes.  Literature which contains vulgarity, promotes immorality, or glorifies that which Allāh has forbidden should not be read.  For example, some famous current day novels glorify magic and sorcery to children, while others promote promiscuousness and adultery amongst adults.  Such novels are detrimental to one's īmān and are not permissible to read. \n\n \n\nOn the other hand, it is permissible to read literature which does not contain un-Islāmic content, but, rather, enhances a person's knowledge or provides some other benefit.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl. Abrar Mirza,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
