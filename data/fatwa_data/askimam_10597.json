  "question": "Is there such a thing as rape in marriage between husband and wife ? and what evidence does a wife need to prove if so ...",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn Islam, there is no such thing as rape between the husband and wife. However, both spouses should be considerate to one another in their conjugal relationship. If the wife or the husband does not wish to have a relationship due to circumstances, for example, being tired, ill, etc. then that should be considered.\n\nMarriage is not all about conjugal relationship but about love, and compassion for one another.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
