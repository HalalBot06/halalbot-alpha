  "question": "Interpretation of a dream - Am I being asked to revive friendhip with her again?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI'm a sunni Muslim from Pakistan and I know an Iranian non-religious woman as a friend (we're in the same professional field.She was not my girlfriend but romance was a factor).We ended all communications with each other recently.Then I saw this dream \"I'm in a kitchen and a graceful, cheerful and beautiful Persian lady dressed in white walks in along with her kids and begins cooking.Basicaly 2 or 3 little boys dressed in white along with a little girl about 10 years old.This girl's dress was neither white nor black (orange or purple I think) and she was neither good looking nor ugly.Then I noticed that this girl was actually this same Iranian woman that I know.She then told me that I had been difficult/snobbish with her.Then a friendly and playful white dog grabbed my foot in his mouth and at the same time one foot of the girl.The dog held the two feet in his jaws without hurting.There was no pain involved.\"End of Dream.Am I being asked to revive friendhip with her again?It's entirely possible that I had been harsh to her.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream has no significance. You should ignore the dream.\n\nFurthermore, it is not permissible to be in friendship with a girl. It is a\nmajor sin.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
