  "question": "What do Muslims think about Sufism?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs sufism a good way to know Allah? Is Sufism good or bad for Muslims? or Is Sufism not a part of the Islam?. I would like that the Imam give to me a clearly answer about Sufism.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSufism is a process of spiritual upliftment. It is a way of reforming\noneself and attaining closeness to Allah Ta'ala. Spiritual upliftment,\nreformation and attaining closeness to Allah are orders replete in the Qur'\naan.\n\nIf it is possible for any individual to reform himself, he should do so.\nHowever, it is generally noticed that individuals experience difficulties in\nreforming themselves and seek assistance of a spiritual guide who is pious\nand adhere to Shari'ah in reforming themselves. The practise of taking\nallegiance (Bay'at) and following the guidance of one's spiritual mentor is\ncalled Sufism.\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
