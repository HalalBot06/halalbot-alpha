  "question": "Was the math-hab of Dawud Zahiri rightly guided?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have read that the zahiris did not consider it a sin to beat up one's parents. Is this true?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDawood Zahiri was a great scholar and Jurists. However, his Madhab did not\ncontinue like the other four famous Madhaahib. It is highly unlikely that it\nwas permissible according to them to beat up one's parents as he used to the\nZaahiri (literal) meanings of the Qur'aan and Hadith.\n\nThe Zaahir of the Qur'aan prohibiting abuse to parents is expressly clear.\n\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
