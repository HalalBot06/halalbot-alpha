  "question": "If one owns 40% of shares in a company, then how is Zakaat calculated on his share?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the company is a trading investment then Zakaat is payable on the capital amount as well as the dividends. If the company is not a trading investment and only receives income, for example, from rentals of properties, then Zakaat is liable only on the dividends.\n\nIn this case, as a shareholder of a trading investment, Zakaat is due at 2.5% of the 40% shareholding on the capital, as well as on the dividends.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best.\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n(Al-Mahmood 12)"
