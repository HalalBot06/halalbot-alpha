  "question": "Some people pray 2 Rakaat while the Khutbah is going on, during Friday prayers. Which is more important? Please explain while quoting the related Ahadith. Also comment on the Nafl before Maghrib.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn some Masjids in the Saudi Arabia, they allow as much as 10-20 minutes to pray Nafl (2 rakaats) before the Maghrib Salaat. Please provide the source of this practice.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala has mentioned in the noble Qur'aam, 'When the Qur'aan is%0D%0Arecited, listen to it with attention and remain silent so that you may%0D%0Areceive mercy.' (al-A'raaf)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Mufassireen (commentators of the Qur'aan) have stated that this refers%0D%0Ato Salaat and the Khutbah of Jummu'ah. Such was the Tafseer of Mujaahid,%0D%0AAttaa, Sa'eed ibn Jubayr and others. (Tafsir ibn Katheer vol.2 pg.292-3).%0D%0AHence, the obligation of keeping quite during the Khutbah will be preferred%0D%0Ato the performing 2 Rakaats Tahiyyatul Masjid upon entering the Musjid which%0D%0Ain principle is Mustahabb (preferred act).%0D%0A%0D%0AAn obligation cannot be left out due to the fulfillment of a Mustahabb. In%0D%0Afact, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has mentioned that if anyone%0D%0Aduring the time of the Khutbah advises his brother to keep quite, then he%0D%0A(the advisor) has committed a void action (and his reward will be%0D%0Adecreased). This further emphasizes the obligation of listening attentively%0D%0Ato the Khateeb (speaker).%0D%0A%0D%0AFor this reason, it was the Madhab of many Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) and%0D%0ATaabi'een that they would not perform these 2 Rakaats while the Khutbah was%0D%0Ataking place. This was the practice of the likes of Sayyiduna Umar, Uthmaa,%0D%0AAliyy, ibn Abbaas and others (Radhiallaahu Anhum). (See Musannaf ibn Abi%0D%0AShaybah; Musannaf Abdur Razzaaq, Nasbur Raaya and Bazlul Majhood vol.2%0D%0Apg.192)%0D%0A%0D%0AAs for Nafl before Maghrib Salaats, its permissibility is proven through%0D%0Avarious Ahaadith. However, this was not a constant practice of Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). In fact, nor was it the practice of the%0D%0AKhulafaa-e-raashideen. Instead, the actual practice of Rasulullah and the%0D%0Amajority of many companions was to hasten with the Fardh of Maghrib Salaat.%0D%0A(Tahawi).%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Hanafi scholars have ruled that it is Makrooh to delay the Fardh of%0D%0AMaghrib for no valid reason. And the 2 Rakaats before Maghrib due to it%0D%0Abeing in the category of Nafl and not Sunnat is not a valid reason for this%0D%0Acause. Just as one can perform it before Maghrib, he could perform it after%0D%0AMaghrib Salaat as well.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
