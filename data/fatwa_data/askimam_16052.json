  "question": "Can i pray Salaah sitting down?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni work in an open plan office and would like to know if it is acceptable to pray salaah 'siiting down' , cos this way there is some privacy when praying.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nQiyam (standing) is obligatory in Fardh Salaah. If one performs his Fardh Salaah whilst sitting without any valid reason, the Salaah will not be accepted.\n\n(Fatawa Mahmoodiyah Vol.5 Pg.544 – Jami’ah Farooqiyah)\n\nPrivacy is not a condition for Salaah. Therefore, this cannot be regarded as a valid reason for performing Salaah whilst sitting. Moreover, one is encouraged to perform his Fardh Salaah in disclosure as it could be a reminder for others to perform their Salaah. Moreover, this could also be a means of inviting non-Muslims towards Islam.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Abu Yahya\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nConcurred by:\n\nMl. Ehzaz Ajmeri,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nDarul Iftaa"
