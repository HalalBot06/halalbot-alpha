  "question": "I worked with an employer till June 4, But before this from May 15 I joined the new employer and worked for him",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI worked with an employer till June 4 (i requested my employer to terminate my contract because i got another job). But before this from May 15 I joined the new employer and worked for him. They (the new employer) said the contract will be signed from June 1, but they will also pay me for these 16 extra days(i.e. from May 15 to May 31), and then they paid me the money for these 16 days as promised. Since my contract with the old employer was terminated on June 4, i was on their payroll and was actually getting pay from them also. Now I would like to know whether it is okay to get pay from both employers. In effect i got pay from both employers for 20 days (16 days of May 4 days of June). Both employers knew the complete situation, and i was still completing the duties of my old employer. What should i do? Is it okay to get money from both sides, if not, should i return the money? and to whom, the new employer or the old employer. (the rate of money they pay is different). Please guide me in this concern. Jazakallah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe payment you received from both employers is permissible for you.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
