  "question": "Why is it that Eid Fitr falls on different month in the Christian Calender? Don't Islamic calender have 365 days, 12 months?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs Jihad-e-kashmir Share'eh Jihad and which organization you feel is doing honestly on the basis of Shari'ah. Jazak Allah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRadio786 is the organ of a Cape-based organisation, the Islamic Unity Convention. This organisation was founded with the ostensible purpose of being an umbrella body to various Muslim organisation countrywide. Its launch was attended by a representatives of large number of actual organisation and pseudo-organisations. This was done in order to bestow upon the IUC a semblance of representation of Muslim interests, in the Cape specifically, and countrywide in general.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn reality, the IUC is the brainchild of Ahmad Cassiem, the leader of the radical organisation Qiblah. He is its present leader and ideologue. Its founder members were mostly businessmen with a history of non-cooperation with, and even opposition to the Ulama. It speaks a politicised rhetoric that has its roots in the anti-apartheid struggle, and continues to thrive off national and international anti-Muslim sentiments and incidents.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the highly politicised ideology of its leader the dividing lines between Sunni and Shi'i have lost all relevance. The radio station is known to have broadcast programmes of an overtly Shi'i nature.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe radio station does not enjoy the support or participation of the Ulama. The Ulama who participate or have in the past participated in its programmes are as a rule disgruntled with the MJC, and as such belong to the margins of the Ulama fraternity.%0D%0A%0D%0AMutual hostility exists between the MJC and the IUC. This hostility between the parent bodies extends to their respective radio stations. I think that it would be safe to say that in the Cape the IUC and Radio786 represent the opposition to the Ulama as represented in the MJC.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
