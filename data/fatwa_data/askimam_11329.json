  "question": "When standing up from Sujood some people actually sit (in jalsa) for sometime b4 getting up, instead of doing it in one motion, is this required by Sunnah? Should the bottom be on floor for jalsa?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAlso when sitting in Jalsa, I was told there?s Hadith requiring us to rest our bottom on the floor not on our left foot. If so, please provide it. When these people next to me in Jamaat (congregation) sit in jalsa for a few seconds before getting up, and I have already stood up for the next Rakaat, I get confused if I am doing the right thing until they finally stand up. I know they are not doing it due to a physical disability.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe sitting after the two Sajdas in odd rakaats, one and three is called Jalsa Istiraahat. To rest the bottom on the floor instead of the left foot is called Tawarruk.\n\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, it is better to stand up for the next rakaat in one motion without Jalsa Istiraahat. It is also better to sit on the left foot than making Tawarruk. However, one may make Jalsa Istiraahat and Tawarruk due to circumstances, for example, old age, etc. It is possible that the members of your congregation follow other Madhaahib which prefer Jalsa Istiraahat and Tawarruk even without an excuse.\n\nIf you are following the Hanafi Madhab, your practise is correct.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
