  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it Fardh to grow a beard in Islam?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu 'alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nFor Muslim males to grow a beard is Waajib (compulsory), and to let it grow a fist length is Waajib. Without any Sharée reason to cut or shave is Haraam (totally prohibited). He who does so is a Faasiq (sinner) and to shorten it less than a fist length is Makruh Tahrimi (near Haraam).\n\n\n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\n\n \n\n________\n\n' Dari Aur Ambiyaa\nKi Sunnate, Mufti Saeed Palanpuri."
