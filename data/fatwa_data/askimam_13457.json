The entire family of the wife is very very anxious for this reason.Please make doa for the family.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to the Shari’ah, the right of divorce is vested in the husband. The wife cannot divorce her husband. She may take the route of Khula and propose to the husband to return the Mahr to him in lieu of him giving the divorce. If he agrees on that, Khula will constitute one Talaaq-e-Baain, an irrevocable divorce.\n\nIf the husband refuses Khula, then her only recourse is to refer her matter to the local Ulama and request for an annulment of her marriage. The Ulama will apply the Shari’ah laws of Faskh and annul the Nikah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
