  "question": "As-Salaam-u-Alaikum. I have two questions on Salaat. These have actually happened to me. Please read details. Jazakallahu-khair.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) When performing Fard salaat behind the Imaam who then performs Sajdah Shaw in the final rakaat, should you follow him? 2) If someone walks in front of you whilst performing Salaat, is your salaat valid? What if a small child walks across? What should you do if someone is about to walk across you?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. When the Imaam makes Sajda-e-Sahw, the follower (Muqtadi) must also make\nSajda-e-Sahw.\n2. It is Makrooh for a person to walk in front of a person performing\nSalaat. However, that does not invalidate the Salaat. The person performing\nSalaat should place a Sutra (barrier) in front of him to avoid a person\ncrossing within the Sutra.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
