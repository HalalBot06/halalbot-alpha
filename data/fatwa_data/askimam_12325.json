  "question": "Does women need husband's permission to spend her own wealth? Is it right for women to ask her husband about monthly allowance even they are fulfilling all her needs?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy husband earns good money and he is fulfilling all my needs.Sometimes i ask him for some allowance for my personal needs such as sadqa or in case of emergency.But i don't have any money or my personal account .He rejects and said it is not neccesary.So please tell me is it right for me to ask for monthly allowance or not.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The wealth and property of a woman belongs solely to her. The husband has no right whatsoever over her property.\n\n2. Your husband is not compelled to provide you a monthly allowance if he fulfils all your basic needs. However, it would be commendable if he provided with a small allowance for your personal expenditure. We suggest you very politely and affectionately request of him to give you a small allowance explaining to him the desire every single human cherishes to have a little ?something? for those ?personal purchases?. However, you may not demand this allowance if all your needs are being met.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
