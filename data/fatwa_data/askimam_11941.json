  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. In Barelvi Masjid, I find that during Iqamat, Immaam keep sitting until \"Haiyya alas salah\" is recited. Then Imaam stands up and begin Salaat. Is it proven from the Hadith? 2. If I recited Surah Faatiyaah but due to some mistakes or disturbance, I recited Surah Faatiyaah again. Should I do sajada Sahu for this? 3. For learning pupose, I have written Surah Rahmaan on a peice of paper not in Arabic but in English phonetically as \"Ar Rahmaan Allamal KurAan ______.\" Can I touch this paper without wudu?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. One should note that a lot of emphasis has been in the Ahaadith as well as by the Hanafi school of thought with regards to forming the Saffs straight. It has been narrated by Abu Hurairah (R.A.) that Nabi (S.A.W.) said: ?Keep the Imam in the middle and fill in the gaps.? (Abu Dawood, Vol. 1. Page 99) Keeping the Imam in the middle means that the Muqtadis should keep the Saffs level on the right and the left in a manner that the Imam remains level. It has also been narrated by Anas (R.A.) that Rasoolullah (S.A.W.) said: ?Straighten your Saffs for indeed the straightness of the Saff is from the completion of Salaah.? (Muslim, Vol. 1, Page 182) In another Hadith it has been mentioned that once Nabi (S.A.W.) came into the Masjid onto the Musallah and was about to begin the Salaah when he saw a man?s chest sticking out from the Saff. He said: ?Servants of Allah! Keep your Saffs straight or else Allah will cause you disunite.? (Muslim, Vol. 1, Page 182) %0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AAs for the Imam and the Muqtadi to stand up at the time of ?Hayya ?Alal Falaah? to form the Saffs and begin the Salaah on ?Qad Qaamatis Salaah? is a Mustahab act and from the Aadaab of Salaah.%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the abovementioned detail it is evident that the Shari?ah has laid more emphasis on straightening the Saffs compared to standing up on ?Hayya ?Alal Falaah? and beginning the Salaah on ?Qad Qaamatis Salaah?. The Fuqahaa are also unanimous that it is Aulaa (more preferable) to begin the Salaah on the completion of the Iqaamah so that the person giving the Takbeer can also join the Imam with Takbeer-e-Oola and the Imam can also straighten the Saffs after the Takbeer. The Fuqahaa are also of the view that a Mustahab act should be left out in order to fulfil the importance of forming the Saffs straight. To stand up at the beginning of the Takbeer was also the habit of the Sahabah Kiraam. It has been mentioned in Fathul Baari that it has been proven that the Sahabah used to stand up when the Muazzin used to start the Iqaamah. (Raddul Muhtaar, Vol. 1, Page 354, Fathul Baari, Vol. 2, Page 99, Fataawaa Rahimiyyah, Vol. 8, Page 202)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. If you recited Surah Fatihah twice then Sajdah Sahw will become Waajib. (Raddul Muhtaar, Vol. 1, Page 340) %0D%0A%0D%0A3. It will not be permissible to touch such a paper without Wudhu on which the Qur?an is written in transliteration form.
