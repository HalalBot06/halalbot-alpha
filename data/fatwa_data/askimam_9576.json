  "question": "If intention to fast for the day is made in the morning after waking up, but before doing anything to nulify a fast; is the fast valid?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1.) I have missed a fast in Ramadaan due to illness. I have, from the outset intended to keep a Qadhaa fast for this. However, one morning when waking up, I decided to fast for the day as a Qadhaa for the one missed. Is the fast valid or do I have to keep another fast? 2.) I have also made a vow to keep a fast (ie. promised to fast if Allah grants the dua). The event has happened. I kept the fast as in the above manner. Is this fast valid?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Qadhaa fast has to be intended from the night, i.e. before Subh-e-Saadiq. Hence, your fast will not be regarded as Qadhaa and will have to be repeated.\n\n2. If the vow was not specified to be kept on a specific day, then the fast will be valid as long as the intention to fast was made before half of the day.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
