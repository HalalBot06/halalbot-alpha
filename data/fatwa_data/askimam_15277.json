  "question": "What is the ruling for Accountants for such Job ? Should I leave the job ? What should I do ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalam Alekum\n\nI am working as an Accountant in a company (owned by a Hindu person) selling Electronics Audio Video products, Camera etc. I am not directly involved in the sales but I am recording all financial transactions and preparing Profit & Loss/ Financial Statements at the end of Year, which helps the company to get  Loans from conventional Bank for the business.  Sometimes I have to prepare Promissory Notes for Loans  which includes Bank interest. I can not avoid preparing of such documents.  This is main job of every accountant.\n\n1) What is the ruling for Accountants for such Job ? Should I leave the job ? What should I do ?\n\n2) What is the ruling to do a partnership business with a HIndu ?\n\nPlease reply in detail. Jazakallah Kher\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1. There are two issues in your work.\n\na)      Recording previous interest transactions.\n\nb)      Actively engaged in obtaining interest loans.\n\nYou will be excused in recording previous interest transactions. It will not be permissible to be actively involved in preparing documents to obtain interest loans. If you will not be excused from that, you should seek an alternative employment.\n\n2. It is permissible to enter into a business partnership with a Hindu. However, the permissibility will primarily depend on the type of partnership.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
