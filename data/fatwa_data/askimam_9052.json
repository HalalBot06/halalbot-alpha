  "answer": "QUESTION\nsalam, im 14 years old and i have hit puberty but my mum has not said anything to me about shaving what shall i do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for the question which you have sent to the institute. I am pleased that you have realized the importance of Tahaarah (cleanliness) in Islam. In a hadith of our beloved Nabi (sallallaahu alayhi wassallam) we are told that \"Cleanliness is half of your Imaan.\"%0D%0A%0D%0ALet me just point out an interesting fact to you. Do you know that when a patient has to have surgery to any part of her%2Fhis body, she%2Fhe has to be shaved first? For instance, if you are to have your appendix removed, your whole abdomen will be shaved from the navel and including the top of your thighs. You may wonder why. It is because the skin and hair trap dirt and harbour organisms which could be a cause of infection. The surgeon's main aim is to prevent his patient from being infected and this is why this precaution is taken.%0D%0A%0D%0AIsn't it amazing that although this practice came into the medical field only in the last century, Allah Ta'ala had given this knowledge to our beloved Nabi(sallallaahu alayhi wassallam) over a century and four hundred years ago? We have learnt this important lesson from him. It was only in the last century that people in the west came to realize the importance of shaving off hair under the arms pits and from the pubic area.%0D%0A%0D%0ADo remove the hair from these two areas before they gain the length of a grain of rice. Do also cut your nails frequently as this is another area where harmful organisms accumulate. In fact it is advisable to trim your nails and remove pubic hair when you make ghusl every Friday. It is just so refreshing and gives you a feeling of cleanliness almost immediately.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala guide you to seek knowledge of deen (and about your duties and practice of deen) so that you may grow up to be able to put into practice your knowledge. Ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A1SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
