  "question": "What is the maximum, or minimum age difference in Islam between spouses?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-u-alaiqum, Can you please explain what is the maximum, and minmum age difference between a husband and wife in Islam? Would it be allowed to refuse a proposal solely because of age difference, claiming that the difference is too little, or too great? Jazakullah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is no ruling in the Shariah with regards to the age of the spouses being too little or too great. Age does not really matter. It is better for the age of the spouses to be close while the age of the man should be greater. However, the lady can refuse to marry because of the age difference.
