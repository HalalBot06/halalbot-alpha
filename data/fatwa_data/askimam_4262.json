  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-u-Alaikum, I've few queries regarding the dress of women, 1. can a women wear jeans if it lose so that the body shape is not exposed or a tight jeans with a long shirt so that the hips are completely covered. 2. Is it allowed for a women to offer prayer in t-shirts or shirts with such a hijab so that the bossoms are completely covered. 3. Can a women wear half sleeves shirts while offering prayer. Sometimes, my cousin sister use to offer her prayers in t-shirts so I want to know whether her salat is accepted or not in such a conditions. Kindly reply as soon as possible so that I can guide my cousin properly. Wasalam,\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two aspects to your query.\nWomen's attire in general\nFemale attire during Salaah\nA female should display shame and modesty in every aspect of her life, her\ncharacter as well as her clothing. She should not wear revealing clothes or\ntight fitting cloths which reveals the form and shape of her body. When she\nexits her home, she should don her hijaab and not intermingle with Ghair\nMahram (not prohibited in marriage) males as every human being has a Nafs\n(desires) which becomes even more mischievous with the motivation of the\nShaitaan. Intermingling may lead to any type of illicit relationship - from\nevil thoughts till actual intimacy. That is death to spirituality. As\nregards to attire in Salaah in principal, a female is required to cover all\nher hair and the entire body including her forearms. In covering herself,\nshe should don modest attire as explained above.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrah"
