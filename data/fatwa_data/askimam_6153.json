  "question": "how is one suppoesed to pray in an aeroplane when there is no other choice",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf any Salaat time approaches during the flying time, that Salaat should be\nperformed on the plane. You should inform the flight attendants of your\nreligious obligation and request them to facilitate for you by arranging an\nisolated corner to perform your Salaat. In our experiences of traveling by\nplane, we have observed that flight attendants of all flights are very\naccommodating. However, due to their responsibilities, we should co-operate\nwith them as well.\n\nYou should calculate the Salaat times during your travel and every Salaat\nshould be performed timeously. If there will be a few stop-overs and if the\npassengers are not required to be on board the plane, then you should\nperform the Salaat of that time in the transition lounge of the airport.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
