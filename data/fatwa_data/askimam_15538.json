  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to ask about the regrets which are distrubing me. Once I had a intercourse and I performed oral to my wife, May I please know, how to repent on that, becuase I feel like I have done a very big sin.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh.\n\n \n\nOral sex is prohibited. It is also against shame and modesty.\n\nIntercourse is a human demand and should be fulfilled in a most respectable manner. Alhamdulillah you regret your wrong. Sincere repentance is never to repeat that sin in future. Whenever you think of that sin, recite Astaghfirullah and ask Allah to forgive you for the thought of that sin.\n\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
