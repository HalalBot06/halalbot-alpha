  "question": "Assalammualaikum Warahmatullah Wabarakatuh Dearest Mufti,I require your assistance on 3 matters",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Are spiritual powers permissible, powers like being to be resistant to Machete attacks, flying,giving deathly(literally) punches,chewing glass and not get cut and viewing jinns. I ask because i have seen Indonesian Muslims set explosives on their bodies and not blow up, also I know of people with these powers who are very pious. Are these powers permissible, your assistance is appreciated. 2. Can a muslimah(recently converted) live with her non-muslim(christian) family. 3. I live in a secular country, and I am still in school, my beard has grown to a length of about half of the little finger.My school's principal and discipline masters are telling me to shave it off,i doubt talking to her will do much good since i am the only one who is persistent in keping a beard,also i wish to say that there are many ustaz in my country who do not keep a beard the length of a fist, will it be okay to trim it with a scissors? Thank You.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Taala mentioned the miracles of some prophets in the Quran. For%0D%0Aexample, the melting and moulding of steel in the hands of Dawood (AS), the%0D%0Acuring of the naturally blind, and dumb by Easa (AS). The splitting of the%0D%0Amoon by Rasulullah (SAW). Many companions and pious people also performed%0D%0Amiracles. For example, a Sahabi, Khalid Ibn Waleed (RA) drank a utensil of%0D%0Afatal poison but did not effect him at all. In view of the aforegoing and%0D%0Amany more incidents, it is the belief of the Ahlus-Sunnah that Mu'jizaat%0D%0A(miracles performance by pious people) are Haq (true) and they are powers%0D%0Agifted by Allah and not earned. Shariah does not recognise training oneself%0D%0Ato perform miracles. If the powers referred to in your question are%0D%0Aperformed by pious people who also adhere to the Shariah, then they will%0D%0Aregard as Karaamaat. If they are performed by people guilty of violating and%0D%0Atransgressing the laws of Allah or performed after training, then that is%0D%0Anot Karaamaat. Such miracles have no basis in Shariah.%0D%0AIn order for us to comment, kindly answer the following:%0D%0ADoes her family know of her reversion and what is their attitude towards%0D%0Aher?%0D%0AIs she able to practice Islam while being with her?%0D%0AElaborate on any other family related issue and her reversion.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is compulsory for a male to keep a beard to the length of ones fist. You%0D%0Astated that you doubt talking to the teacher will make a difference. We%0D%0Aadvise you seek an appointment with your teacher and discuss your religious%0D%0Aconvictions of keeping a beard. For that, we advise you prepare%0D%0Aexceptionally well, with references from sources of Shariah, logic, and%0D%0Areligious freedom. The purpose is to convince and influence the mindset of%0D%0Ayour teacher. You should also apply your discretion, wisdom and diplomacy%0D%0Ain your meetings and presentation to your teacher. If you are unsuccessful,%0D%0Ayou should place your attempt on record and take the matter to the%0D%0Aprinciple. You may also consider seeking the assistance of your local%0D%0AIslamic Organisation to represent you and other Muslim students at school.%0D%0AThat may be more effective. Obviously, the Islamically organisation must be%0D%0AOrientated and sincerely advance the course of Islam. You should not succumb%0D%0Ato the advice or pressure of your teacher. Your steadfastness and patience%0D%0Awill yield positive results if you are sincere and turn your gaze to Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
