  "question": "I purchased 3X1 kg of mince for R61.72, and had requested that the mince be packed in polystyrene trays. In so doing, due to the weight of the tray I am receiving 14c perkilograms less mince.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nKindly inform me the Islamic ruling on the above matter (R = Rand; mince = ground meat).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf you ordered 3 kilograms of mince, it (the mince) must be weighed\nseparately without the trays as the weight of the tray will be included in\nthe scale thereby decreasing the weight of the mince in proportion to the\nweight of the tray. The difference could be quite significant especially\nwhen one purchases a large volume. Alternatively, the weight of the tray be\ntaken into consideration and the mince will be increased in proportion to\nthe weight of the tray.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best.\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
