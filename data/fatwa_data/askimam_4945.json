  "question": "If a woman had an abortion what can she do to atone for this major sin?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf abortion is killing the child, does the woman require the punishment of death according to Islam? If not, what can she do to atone so that Allah will let her into Jannah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, 'Every son of\nAadam (Alayhis salaam) errs and transgresses. The best of transgressors is\nhe who repents.' (Mishkaat)\n\nThe best weapon Allah Ta'ala has blessed us with is that of Tawbah\n(repentance). Therefore, we should cry and repent to Allah Ta'ala and beg\nhis forgiveness. Thereafter, one should be convinced he has been forgiven.\nThat is all that is required in this situation.\n\nAfter sincere Tawbah, one should not let the past disturb you. Shaytaan\ndesires to frustrate or disturb the peace of mind of the sincere Mu'min. We\nshould direct our attention to how we may be more obedient to Allah Ta'ala\nand not occupy ourselves with the past that cannot be undone.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
