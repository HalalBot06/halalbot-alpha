  "question": "Taking a loan on interest",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI made one big blunder 2 years back. my brother had taken a car on loan, knowing fully well that the amount which he has to pay back to bank will also include the interest. The mistake which I had made is that i am the guarenter for him and have signed the documents , it means in that interest process i am also the party. kindly suggest me the remeady as i know that my brother wll not agree to the full payment of the car at a time to the bank.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThe wrong has already been committed. It is necessary that you repent to Allah Ta’ala and make a firm resolution not to carry out such actions in the future. You should also advise your brother that getting involved in interest bearing transactions is against the command of Allah Ta’ala and he should not get involved in such transactions. You have already signed the documents to stand as guarantee for your brother. Legally you are bound to stand to your word. An alternative could be that you borrow money from some friends or family and pay out the bank at once thereby lowering the interest payable and thereafter repay the loan.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
