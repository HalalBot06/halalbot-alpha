  "question": "We pelted the jamaraat before Dhuhr on the 12th of Dhul-Hijjah. Was that a permissible time?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nA family member and I made rami (pelting) around 11:30 am before Dhuhr on the 12th of Dhul Hijjah. Did we make a mistake or not? If we made a mistake please guide us. We will very much appreciate your answer.  May Allah always keep you healthy.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nOn the 12th of Dhul Hijjah, the time for rami (pelting) begins from Zawaal, it is not permissible to do it before that.1  The local time for Zawaal in and around the vicinity of Makkah (including Mina) was approximately 12:06 pm on the 12th of Dhul-Hijjah. \n\nIf rami (pelting) was performed in the impermissible time it has to be made up by redoing the pelting and giving a damm*. The time for redoing the pelting expired at sunset on the 13th of Dhul-Hijjah, so now only a damm is wajib on you.2\n\n*Damm: Refers to the slaughtering of a goat, a sheep or a one-seventh part of a cow or a one-seventh part of a camel within the precincts of the Haram in lieu of certain violations made while performing the manaasik (rites) of Hajj.\n\nPlease see the chart below for the Sunnah, Makruh (disliked), and impermissible times for making rami (pelting) during Hajj:3\n\n \n\nDay\n\n\t\n\nSunnah\n\n\t\n\nMakruh (Disliked)\n\n\t\n\nImpermissible\n\n\n\n\n10th\n\n\t\n\nSunrise to Zawaal\n\n(Permissible: Zawaal to Sunset)\n\n\t\n\nFajr Sadiq to Sunrise and\n\nSunset to Fajr Sadiq of 11th\n\n\t\n\nBefore Fajr Sadiq of 10th\n\n\n\n\n11th\n\n\t\n\nZawaal to Sunset\n\n\t\n\nSunset to Fajr Sadiq of 12th\n\n\t\n\nFajr Sadiq until Zawaal\n\n\n\n\n12th\n\n\t\n\nZawaal to Sunset\n\n\t\n\nSunset to Fajr Sadiq of 13th\n\n\t\n\nFajr Sadiq until Zawaal\n\n\n\n\n13th\n\n\t\n\nZawaal to Sunset\n\n\t\n\nFajr Sadiq to Zawaal of 13th\n\n\t\n\nAfter Sunset\n\n \n\n\n*Fajr Sadiq: When the time of Fajr begins. Also known as “Subh Sadiq”\n\n*Zawaal: When the sun begins to move away from its central meridian. It is the beginning time of Dhuhr (to which a few minutes should be added as a precaution before praying Dhuhr).\n\nFor the old, the weak and the women, the Makruh times given above will not be considered makruh if they fear the rush and crowding. With the exception of these it is Makruh for others.4\n\n\nPelting on the 13th of Dhul-Hijjah5:\n\nThose who leave Mina for Makkah before sunset on the 12th,  pelting is not necessary for them on the 13th.\n\nThose who leave after Maghrib of the 12th it is Makruh for them to leave Mina without pelting on the 13th in its permissible time.\n\nThose who are present in Mina at the time of Fajr Sadiq on the 13th, pelting for them becomes wajib on the 13th.\n\n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMl.
