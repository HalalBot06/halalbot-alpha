  "answer": "QUESTION\nass. wr. wb. I have read various books on the ettiquite of jima'. I have few difficulties in following many of them : For example, the timing: Some said we should not perform jima' on the early, middle and last day of lunar month. For us, it's hard to control the date (as we live in a non muslim country). Many time we perform jima' while our 1 year baby are sleeping next to us. We also always postponed our wudhu or ghusl after jima' since I feel very tired and lazy, and even if we want to do it for the second time, we never made wudhu or ghusl before hand. Alhamdulillah, we managed to read do'a and cover ourselves. I read at those books, some of this sunnat if we did not performed it, it will cause some consequences to our coming baby. 1. Please gave some advice. 2. Can we read books on some jima' position published by muslim (in illustration) or non-muslim (in real pictures) wass. wr. wb.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for the husband and wife to consummate any time during the month. The period of menses is obviously excluded as it is prohibited during that time to be intimate in the area between the navel and knee. It is advisable to wash oneself and make wudhu after consummating. It is not necessary. Should there be an urge to consummate the second time, without washing, that is also permissible. We are busy preparing a book on the subject matter and will post it on the net soon. We discourage reading books on the subject matter prepared and published by non-Muslims as such books generally breathe immorality and immodesty.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
