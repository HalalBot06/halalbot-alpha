  "question": "Derogative remarks whilst doing Dawah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIn the document \"Statements of the Scholars of the Sunnah concerning the Jamaa'ah at-Tableegh\" they allege that they (those of Tabligh Jammaat)perform Bidah and they are from the 72 sects that Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) prophesised of being deviators, and also that they do not invite to the quran and nor the sunnah, rather they invite to illiyaas, their Shaykh in Bangladesh. It quite claer that what they use as arguments are quite incorrect as Moulana Illiyass is of India. Please shed light on this subject and as to the motives of these \"ulamas\" to slur the name of tabligh without the slightest factual evidence.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is our humble advise to continue doing the noble work of Da'awah. That\nwas the salient feature of the Ambiyaa.\n\nThey too experienced difficulties and derogative remarks but were patient\nand continued with the work for the pleasure of Allah Ta'ala. It is useful\nto engage your time in something constructive that will yield benefit rather\nthan being concerned of the criticism and responding to that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
