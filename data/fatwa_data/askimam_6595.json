I would like to know the islamic way of celebration of annivesaries of business firms/human beings?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIslam does not sanction the celebration of anniversaries and birthdays in a\nmanner that resembles the lifestyle and methods of the Kuffaar.\n\nThe Islamic way is to use this opportunity to be grateful to Allah Ta'ala\nfor all that He has given us. We should express our gratitude to Allah by\nsubmitting to Allah Ta'ala in all the aspects of our life. Bring every\nsingle aspect of our lives according to the commands of Allah and Sunnat of\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Together with this, we should make Du'aa\nand pray to Allah Ta'ala thanking Him for all that He has given us. We could\nalso spend some of the wealth in charity (Sadaqah) in the numerous avenues\nthat are available nowadays.\n\nWe have considered the lucky dip contest in the context of celebrations and\nanniversaries.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
