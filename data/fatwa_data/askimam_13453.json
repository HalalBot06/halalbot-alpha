  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf a Non-Hanifi person likes to follow few rullings from Hanifi fiqh, is this OK ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is compulsory to adhere to one particular Madhab. (Rasmul Mufti; ibn Aabideen Shaami)\n\n \n\nIt is not permissible to follow the rulings of another Madhab without need. Furthermore, the need to follow another Madhab must be referred to a reliable Aalim / Mufti. If he determines that there is a need (Dhuroorat) then only may follow the ruling of another Madhab, in that particular matter only.\n\n \n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
