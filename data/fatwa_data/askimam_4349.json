  "question": "Child Abuse in Islam",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhere does the issue of sexual child abuse fit into Islam? What is Islam's stance on this? Is it mentioned in any hadith or verses from the Quran? What are the punishments for the abusers? I myself was a victim for 15 yrs by various people. I am finally at a point in my life where I've stopped \"questioning\" Allah, and am able to say \"Alhumdolillah\" and accept my fate as the will of Allah. Still however, I am sometimes overwhelmed...what can I do (zikr) to help myself through psychologically and emotionally draining moments? I am also frequently plagued by nightmares, what should I do for those? Finally, is it considered better to not share your dreams (good or bad) with anyone? JazakAllah khair..\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAbuse of anything, (inanimate or animate, human being or animal) at any%0D%0Alevel is haraam (strictly prohibited). If a person is convicted for such a%0D%0Acrime, he%2Fshe will be charged and dealt with appropriately. It is%0D%0Aunfortunate that you have become a victim of abuse for which we deeply%0D%0Aregret and sincerely sympathise with you. Your questioning of Allah was%0D%0Aprobably due to thinking that was the decree of Allah and that being your%0D%0Afate. That is not so. Allah never decrees abuse. Allah's knowledge is%0D%0Aperfect and absolute. He knows ahead of time what is to happen, not that He%0D%0Amade it happen. The abuser will be punished by Allah, your approach and%0D%0Achange of attitude is therefore appropriate. Looking back may not assist you%0D%0Ain any way especially when it is not of your own doing. It will only bring%0D%0Agrief and agony. You should be optimistic and look for bright prospects in%0D%0Alife within the framework of Shariah. Rasulullah (SAW) said, Lighten your%0D%0Aheart often (Abu-Dawood). That may be achieved by engaging in something that%0D%0Ais permissible but interesting to you, especially heart and mind consuming.%0D%0ATrain yourself never to turn back. Look forward and advance.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
