  "question": "I have a Muslim friend who is leading the wrong way in life, how can I help him?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe live in England. My friend has been drinking alcohol, dating girls and going to clubs to dance over the last few years. I want to help him leave this life behind, understand what he is doing will not help him succeed and become a good Muslim. How is the best way to do this as I have tried to explain simply what the harm is but its not working on him. Please advise. Thank you so much.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two aspects here:\nOne is I'elaam (to inform) and the other is I'emaal (to make others\npractice). Informing is merely a means of making others practice. The\npurpose (to make others practice) should be placed first and then wisdom\nshould be applied in trying to achieve the purpose.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
