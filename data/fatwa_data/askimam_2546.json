  "question": "If I need to make an obligatory ghusl, and have a blocked nose, and hence water cannot reach the upper part of my nose, what do I do to make my ghusl valid?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe do not understand what you mean by blocked nose.\n\nIf you mean having a cold, that does not stop the water from going up.\nHowever, in Ghusl, it is sufficient that the water reaches till the soft\nportion of the nose.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
