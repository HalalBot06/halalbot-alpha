  "question": "I was in a relationship for three years, We realised how wrong it was,and have repented can we still marry?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nA couple of years ago I began dating a boy, neither of us was very practising as Muslims at the time. We fell deeply in love and were intent on marrying, Alhamdulillah about 6 months ago we began to get deeper in to Islam and realised how wrong what we were doing was and broke off the relationship. We have not had any contact with each other for quite a few months now, and have both sincerely tried to repent to Allah for what we have done. Is it still permissible for us to marry?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBe thankful to Allah for granting you the realisation of the wrong and the ability to repent. May Allah Ta?ala accept your repentance. You should continue making tawbah and istighfaar every day.\n\nAccording to the Shari?ah, the previous Haraam relationship is not an obstacle for you to marry the boy. It is permissible for both of you to marry.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
