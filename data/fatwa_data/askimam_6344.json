  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe women performed their salaah behind the men. Another sister refused to attend the Jumuah salaah as she says that women cannot perform Salaah behind men in Jamaat. is this true?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two apects to your query, a) The permissibility of women's Salaat\nbehind a man, b) The permissibility for women to attend such a gathering.\n\nEven though it is not necessary for women to read Jumu'ah Salat, but if it\nis read, then this will suffice for the women if the Imaam makes intention\nfor them. (Ielaa-us-sunan)\n\nDue to the corruption prevalent today, it will not be appropriate for women\nto attend such mass gatherings. Hadhrat Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha), the\nblessed wife of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), said after the\ndemise of the prophet Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), 'If our\nprophet was present today (meaning her time), then he would have forbade\nwomen from going to the Musjid because of the corruption.' This was in her\ntime so we can well imagine if our prophet was present today, what would he\nsay.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
