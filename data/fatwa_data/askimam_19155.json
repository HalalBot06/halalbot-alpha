  "question": "I have a medical issue that has affected my life. What is Allah's purpose for this difficulty?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am 23 years old. I have a medical issue which has affected my life and myself very much. Over the years it’s getting worse. My problem is I have high levels of male hormone in me. I find it very embarrassing and it has affected my self esteem tremendously. I have been to many many doctors throughout the years but none could find a solution to it, instead they made it worse. The last doctor I’ve seen wanted to do a specific test which could determine what is causing this male hormone in me, but unfortunately this test cannot be done on a virgin girl. I don’t know where to turn to now. I am becoming hopeless. Every day I keep praying to Allāh to heal this complication in me because I’m afraid I might face difficulty to find a life partner for me.\n\n\nMy question is, though I tried many doctors for this issue, why did it make the matter worse? What is Allāh's purpose? All my life I have been living on a hope that one day Allāh would reward me for keeping my virginity safe, so where is my reward? What should I do? I’m so confused. Is there any specific dua that could heal this complicated disease in me? I don’t like the way I look because the medicines side effects burnt my skin and lost my hair. What can I do to get my beauty back so that I can get married soon? Is there any dua for that? Please help me. I wish there was a way to communicate with Allāh, but that’s just not possible.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. \n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nWe are extremely grieved at your situation and make du῾ā’ that Allāh gives you complete cure from this condition.\n\nAt the outset we want you to know that Allāh tests his beloved slaves to increase their rewards and ranks in His sight. Hence, such difficulties are a sign that Allāh wishes to credit you with immense reward.\n\nOur beloved Prophet salallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam has mentioned in one hadīth that no soul experiences pain, so much so that even a thorn does not prick him, except that his sins are alleviated and his ranks are increased.[1] So while you endure these difficult times, always keep in mind that these difficulties are securing you a better place in the eyes of Allāh.\n\nAllāh is Al-Hakīm (The Wise). There is wisdom in everything that Allāh does. It is due to our short sightedness and lack of understanding that we do not understand the system of Allāh. Maulana Yunus Patel Saheb (db) explains that every Muslim should know any calamity that strikes a person, has an even severer one which could have occurred. In this way he will realize that Allāh has safeguarded him/her from a worse calamity and afforded him/her the rewards by afflicting difficulty of a lesser degree.\n\nIn our times, hormonal imbalance has become a very common condition among women. There is a rise of distress and anxiety attacks because of this condition. This is primarily due to the increase in chemically altered foods. However, these conditions were also present in the times of Sahāba radiallāhu ῾anhum as well. In fact, Imām Tirmidhi rehmatullāh ῾alayh records in his Sunan a detailed incident of Zainab bint Jahsh radiallāhu ῾anha seeking advice from Rasulullah salallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam regarding continual menstrual bleeding (state of Mustahādhah).[2] This is one of the common symptoms of hormonal imbalance. Rasulullah salallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam gave her some advice with regards to the situation keeping consideration of her personal condition as well as the geographical and climatic conditions.\n\nIslam encourages us to live a healthy and wholesome life. Do not become despondent with these trials and tribulations and continue your efforts to find a suitable cure. If conventional medical treatments are not helping then you may try some alternative medicine as well. There is much benefit in some herbal medicines to resolve such imbalances.\n\nIn one Hadīth Jabir radiallāhu ῾anhu narrates from Rasulullāh salallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam that,\n\n“There is a cure for every illness, and when the medicine is applied to the disease it is cured with the permission of Allāh All Mighty and Glorious.\n\n(Sahīh al-Muslim #5466)[3]\n\nWhenever you feel despondent of the situation and helplessness begins to shake your hope for mercy from Allāh, then turn to the Holy Quran and read the life of Sayiduna Ayub ῾alayh salām. Allāh has narrated the history of Ayub ῾alayh salām to instil sabr and patience within the self. It was nothing but the servitude and patience of Ayub ῾alayh salām which earned him the honour of being praised by Allāh Himself. Allāh states about him:\n\n“Truly We found him full of patience. How excellent a servant!\nContinually returning (toward his Lord)!”\n\n(Qur’ān 38:44)[4]\n\nSo keep striving and keep hoping for the bounties of Allāh to pave your path. During your endeavour, keep a close link with Allāh subhānahu wa ta῾āla since this is the primary test in these trials. Stay firm with your daily salāh, reading of Qur’ān and other ῾ibadāt. Utilize these times of worship to increase in your supplications. Allāh loves the humility and humbleness of his slave. When the tests and trials reach an unbearable stage, and yet the slave of Allāh persists in His ῾ibādah and supplication, then the doors of rahmah (mercy) open up and shower the blessings of Allāh upon that slave.\n\n You should also recite the following du῾ā’ abundantly as per the sunnah of Rasulullah salallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam.\n\nكَانَ النَّبِيُّ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ يَدْعُو عِنْدَ الْكَرْبِ يَقُولُ\n\"لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ الْعَظِيمُ الْحَلِيمُ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ رَبُّ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَرَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ\"\nWhenever Prophet salallahu ῾alayh wasallam would face distress he would recite:\n“There is no deity except Allah, The Mighty and Forbearing; There is no deity except Allah, Lord of the skies and the Earth and the Lord of the Mighty Throne”\n\n(Sahih al Bukhari  #6345)[5]\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMl.
