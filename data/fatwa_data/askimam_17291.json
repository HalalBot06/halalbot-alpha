  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nRecently your Dar-ul-iftaa approved of wiping over sealskinz socks. I was sharing this news with another person and he brought up some points which made me doubt whether wiping over these socks is permissible or not.\n\nHis objection is that Khuffain should not be translated as socks because the companions used to wear these independently and for this to be possible\nthe socks would have to very durable, almost shoe like. He also mentioned that since one is allowed to wipe over leather socks for 3 days while traveling, the sealskinz socks should be tested such that one can walk with them for three days (about 50 miles) without ripping them.\n\n1) Is this a valid criterion over and above the three miles criterion set by the illustrious fuqaha?\n2) From where did the fuqaha get the three mile criterion? Should it not be 50 miles instead?\n3) How did the Dar-ul-iftaa test the durability of the sealskinz socks?\n4) Do even the leather socks that are available today meet the criterion that they can be worn independently without ripping?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nFirstly, the appropriate translation of khafayn is leather socks. There is a difference between leather socks and shoes. Leather socks, similar to other socks, are not meant to be walked in without shoes. It is incorrect to assume that the purpose of leather socks is the same as shoes. Therefore, leather socks do not have to be “almost like shoes” as presumed in the query.\n\nSecondly, the permissibly of wiping over leather socks for a period of three days does not mean that one has to continuously be able to walk in them (without shoes) for three days.  This is a misconception. Also, the permissibility of wiping for three days is only for a person who is a shar’i traveler. On normal occasions, the permissibility to wipe is only for 24 hours after renewing the wudū.\n\nThirdly, the original permissibility to wipe is on leather socks. The Jurists have stated that those socks which resemble leather socks will also be permissible to wipe over. To determine this, the Jurists have stipulated certain conditions to indicate whether it falls into this category. We have mentioned these conditions in our fatwa. If the friend whom you discussed this issue is learned in the sciences of Shari’a, then we have provided ample references with page numbers along with the name of the publisher for his benefit. Inshallah, after going through all those texts, his doubt and will be removed and will be able to understand the issue more clearly.\n\nHere are the answers to your questions:\n\nNO\nNo it should not be 50 miles. The three miles criterion is to ensure it resembles leather socks in durability.\nWe tested the socks and found them to fulfill all the conditions.\nLeather socks are not meant to be worn independently. If a person walks in leather socks for 3 miles, it will not rip.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
