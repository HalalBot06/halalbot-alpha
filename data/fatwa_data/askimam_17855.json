  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. We did our nikah secretly because our parents were not agreed. Is this nikah valid?\n\nI m 31 years old and I did the nikah secretly with the man who is 32 years old in the presence of two male muslim and baligh persons, one was the maulvi and the other one was the witness. The maulvi asked from both of us that did we accept our nikah with one another. We acceptd our nikah with one another in the presence of these two male persons one of whom was maulvi and the other was witness. Then maulvi read the khutba of nikah and at the end maulvi did duaah in the presence of me (girl), boy and the one witness. Is this nikah valid?  Now can we live as a husband and wife?  It is our first Nikah with one another? But we said to moulvi we want to renew our Nikah. Does this false statement have any affect on our Nikah?\n\n \n\n2: We did not fix the amount of Meher during the nikah. Does it have any affect on our nikah?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n1.      The conditions of Nikah were found. Therefore your nikah will be valid.\n\n \n\nولا ينعقد نكاح المسلمين إلا بحضور شاهدين حرين عاقلين بالغين مسلمين رجلين أو رجل وامرأتين عدولا كانوا أو غير عدول أو محدودين في القذف {الهداية ج2 ص306}\n\n \n\n2.      Your nikah will be valid even though the Mahr was not fixed however, Mahr-Mithl (that amount of Mahr which women similar to her in her family will receive) will be binding upon the husband.\n\nويصح النكاح وإن لم يسم فيه مهر  … فلا يحتاج إلى ذكره لصحة النكاح\n\n   {الهداية ج2 ص323}\n\nوان تزوجها على أن لا مهر لها فلها مهر مثلها إن دخل بها أو مات عنها\n\n{الهداية ج2 ص324}\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
