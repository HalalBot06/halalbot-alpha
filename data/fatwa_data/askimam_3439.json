  "question": "Impure clothes",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am employed by a large company and obviously working with non-muslims as well. Today, I witnessed a fellow employee consuming bacon & that very same employee, a little while later spoke to me and held me on the shoulder. Upon asking the individual whether he had washed his hands after eating, \"No\" washis reply. Tell me if it is acceptable to read my Zohr salaah or any salaah fo that matter knowing what that individual had done? Is my clothing napaak? Shukraan\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the fellow employee did not wash or wipe his hands and there was a\npossibility of the remains of bacon being on his hands, then in all\nprobability, your clothes will be soiled by the fellow employee touching\nyou. Therefore, the clothing becomes Napaak (impure). It is similar to a dog\nlicking a person.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
