  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Sahab, As-Salaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. I am working in Dubai and my uncle stays in Ras-Al-Khaimah (100kms from Dubai). I usually visit my uncle on weekend. When I go there I pray Kasr. My question is when I return back to Dubai and I have intention to visit him again after 7 days, How should I perform my prayer (Salaat) in Dubai, Kasr or Normal? Can we consider Dubai as our Watan-e-Iqamah. Jazak?um?llah Khair. Was Salaam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf you had initially intended to stay in Dubai for 15 days or more, you will\nbe a Muqeem in Dubai. Your Watan-e-Iqaamat in Dubai will be invalidated only\nif you leave Dubai permanently. Therefore, after qualifying as a Muqeem, if\nyou go to Ras al-Khaymah, you will still be a Muqeem upon returning to\nDubai. (Ahsanul Fataawa)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
