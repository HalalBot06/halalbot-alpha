  "question": "Controlling Fiancee",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy fiancee is incredibly controlling. Is it right for him to say that I am supposed to do whatever it is that he tells me to do.And he does not have to listen to me at all.And is it right for him to make me feel basically like I am his slave.And is it right that he has hit me a few times? We're not even married yet and he tells me that when we get married I will not be able to go out with friends or family if he doesn't want me to.And I am thinking of leaving him but i don't want to hurt my father.And we have already had sex.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nAt the outset, we wish to point out that the western concept of\nFiance/fiancée relationship is Haraam (strictly prohibited). Islam prohibits\nevery type of pre-marital relationship, speaking, etc. and such a\nrelationship is tantamount to Zina (adultery).\n\nYour complains against your fiancée is not legitimate as your relationship\nwith him is itself illegal. The only solution to your problem is to make\nTawbah (sincere repentance) to Allah Ta'ala and sever all ties with the boy.\nIf the boy wish to marry you, then you should exercise precaution and make\nMashwara (consult) with your parents and other seniors. You should also make\nIstikhaara (seek divine guidance).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
