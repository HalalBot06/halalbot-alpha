  "question": "Question concerning interest money and building a wall for a daruloom. someone is willing to give interest money that they have earned from the bank on their money to fund the wall building.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe have a dilemma. We are building a daruloom in Congo along with a Mussala to pray. We have enough funds for this project. For security reasons, we need to build a wall to protect the students. If we take money out of daruloom/mussala funds to build the wall, we will not have enough for the daruloom/musala. There is someone that is willing to give interest money that they have earned from the bank on their money to fund the wall building. Can we take the money?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nInterest monies must be given to the poor and needy who are eligible to accept Zakaat without the intention of reward. However, interest received from government institutes, e.g. post office could be used to offset government taxes. Interest received from private banks cannot be used to offset taxes. It may be used to offset interest charged from the same bank.\n\nInterest monies cannot be used for building the wall.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
