  "question": "How much is a woman is required to cover her body in front of her son?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA woman to her biological child is considered a Mahram (prohibited in\nmarriage) in Shari'ah. Purdah is not necessary from him. Her face, hands,\nfeet, etc. could be exposed in front of him. However, the back, stomach,\nthighs, breasts, etc. have to be covered.\n\nIt is not permissible to expose these areas of the body which can be a cause\nof evil temptations and desires. Hence, a woman must exercise precaution in\nher dressing even though it may be in front of her own children more\nespecially in these times of Fitna (evil) and corruption. (Raddul Muhtaar\nvol.5 pg.259)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
