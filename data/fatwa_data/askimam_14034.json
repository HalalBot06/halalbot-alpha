  "question": "Building Armored vehicles for Middle-Easter nations. Is it Hala?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have been offered a job building armored vehicles in the middle-east. The vehicle is similar to a Hummer H1 but is not owned or operated by GM (the Hummer H1 manufacturer). The company is owned by Arab investors from the gulf. Please find below their web-page: http://www.nimr4x4.com/index.html These vehicles are to be used by armies in the middle east. There is a possibility that these vehicles will be used against the civilians of that area (track record of governments in the middle-east). Am I allowed to fill such a position? A counter argument can be that I am strengthening \"Muslim\" states and offering an alternative source for western military equipment! I originally from the Middle-Easte and I am job hunting to protect my family from the FITNA of western civilization. My recruiter is waiting for an answer on the morning of Feb 14, 2005.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is permissible for you to accept the job of building armoured vehicles. An armoured vehicle could be used for a good or bad purpose. The use is not confined to a bad purpose. If anyone uses it for a bad purpose, you will not be responsible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
