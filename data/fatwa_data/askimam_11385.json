A mureed is a person who takes bay?at. The person who you take bay?at with is called a Shaykh.\n\n2. Taking of bay?at is not restricted to any sect. As such, people who have the zeal and enthusiasm to take bay?at, will do so.\n\n3. Bay?at has been established from the Qur?aan. Refer attached.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
