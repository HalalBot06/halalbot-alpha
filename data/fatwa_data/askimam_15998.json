  "question": "What time does Esha set in?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nplease can you advise of the earliest time one can pray esha, if magrib is 6.42 here in durban - south africa. the masjid is not near home so we cannot hear the esha adhaan...\n\nis it acceptable to pray esha at 7.45 and if this is wrong what are the amends we can make to recitify that error.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh  \n\nThe time of Isha starts when the whiteness in the sky has disappeared.  The scholars have calculated the timings of salat and created a yearly time tables.  The time tables usually state the beginning of each salat time.  One should follow these time tables for the salat times.\n\n \n\nTowards the end of November the time of Maghrib salat was around 6:42 p.m., Isha salat in those days was around 8:12 p.m.  If you have performed your salat at 7:45 p.m. it will not be valid.  Those salats will have to be made up.  It would be best to obtain a copy of the time table from the local masjid for your convenience.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
