  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it haram when your mother give u money to take a bus and then u walk or the bus driver take  u free and u took the money for yourself?\nwhat about if u always when your parents give u money to take a bus from work to home and u walk from work to home so that you can take the money of the bus to yourself?\nplzz tell meif that is haram? thank you..jazakallahu kayr.....\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nMasha Allah very good question. The question shows that you want to be honest and truthful in your financial dealings. You are conscious of what is halal and haram and want to stay away from haram.InshaAllah this attitude will take you a long way in life and make you truthful to Allah.\n\nYour parents give you money to pay for your bus fees. You are their wakeel (representative) to pay the bus fees. In principle a representative is bound to follow the instructions of the mutawakkil (person who made you wakeel). As such you are bound to do as your parents requested you. It is incorrect for you to pocket the bus fees.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best,\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
