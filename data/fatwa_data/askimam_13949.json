  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWoman was sitting in iddah after her husband passed away, she was pregnant at the time of her husband death. she was six weeks in her pregnancy.\n\nshe had a miscarriage in her six week of pregnancy. question is does her iddat expire even the child body was not formed, or what are the requirements of her ending her iddah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. A woman whose husband has passed away under normal circumstances will have to remain in iddah for 4 months and 10 days. Allah mentions this law in the noble Qur’aan, ‘Those women whose husband have passed away shall remain in iddah for 4 months and 10 days.’ (Baqarah 234)\n\n2. If a woman was pregnant and during her pregnancy her husband passes away, then her iddah will terminate as soon as her pregnancy ends. Allah states, ‘For those (women) who carry (life within their wombs), their period (iddah) is until they deliver their burdens.’ (Talaaq 4)\n\n3. If a woman was pregnant and her husband passes away during her pregnancy, thereafter she suffers a miscarriage in the sixth week of her pregnancy, her iddah will not terminate by the miscarriage. She has to remain in iddah for the duration of 4 months and 10 days starting from the day her husband passed away. (Raddul Muhtaar vol.3 pg.512)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
