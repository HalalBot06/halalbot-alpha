  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaikum,Inshallah ,i am sure that i can convience them.At this juncture can i communicate with the girl through chat & mail ?. Wasslam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nShari'ah does not recognise contemporary forms of engagements where\nexorbitant amounts of monies is spent on the occasion. However, the\nengagement is a confirmation to marry. At that stage, the boy and girl are\nstill strangers to one another in that they cannot communicate with one\nanother.\n\nThe premarital outings after the engagement is strictly prohibited in Shari'\nah. Often, such engagements break up leaving a devastating effect on the\nparties and in particular, the 'used' fianc√©e.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
