  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is the duty of a Muslim who finds that a new organisation has entered his/her country and is spreading false beliefs and brainwashing the youth\n \n\nSome of these Beliefs include:\n\n·         You should not follow one mathhab but rather choose the most correct view.\n\n·         Jihad is not applicable in todays day and age!\n\n·         Calling the Mujahideen Terrorists and extremists\n\n·         Calling for an alliance with the West and publicly lecturing Anti Terrorist officials, stating that:  Muslim Scholars should be their natural alliance against the so called Terrorists and extremists.\n\nThe definition of Terrorist and extremist is very broad and would include almost all Muslims as defined by these so called terrorists.\n\n\nHere is an article in the British press regarding these new laws which have been worked on by the same Anti Terrorist official who we are being urged to support and form an Alliance with.\n\n\nAnti-terror code 'would alienate most Muslims'\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/feb/17/counterterrorism-strategy-muslims\n\nThis organisation has branches in the UK, Canada, Aus, India has penetrated into South Africa and has branches in Johannesburg and Durban.\n\nWasalaam\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI can provide you with more information if required!\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nAll the beliefs of the organization in reference are baseless. The muslim community should be notified of that organization so that they could guard themselves from the incorrect beliefs of that organization.\n\nWe advise that you write up to the Jamiatul Ulama in Natal and Transvaal as well as other Ulama bodies and inform them of this organization.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
