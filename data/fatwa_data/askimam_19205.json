  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is the Islamic position on illustrating children’s books?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāh wa-barakātuh.\n\nIn principle, in order to merit reward for any noble task we undertake, both the intention and the method of achieving our goal must be in conformity with the Sharī’ah.\n\nAlthough writing books for children in order to enhance their education is a praiseworthy effort, it is important that one does not try to accomplish this at the expense of committing the harām of drawing animate objects.  Instead, with some additional thought and creativity, one can adequately educate children without engaging in the abovementioned harām.\n\nAnd Allah knows best.\nMufti Abrar Mirza\nChicago, IL (USA)\n\nUnder the Supervision of Mufti Ebrahim Desai (South Africa)\n\n \n\n2011-04-15\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nDISCLAIMER – AskImam.org questions\n\nAskImam.org answers issues pertaining to Sharī’ah.
