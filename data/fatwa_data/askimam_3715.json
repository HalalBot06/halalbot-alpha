  "question": "Why marry the people of Hell?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf Christians and Jews are people of the Hell, then why did Allah allow Muslim men to marry them? Why didn't Allah allow men to marry the Hindu women who is also going to go to Hell? Do all of the Islamic Scholars agree that Christians and Jews will go to Hell? What is going to happen to a Jew who dies for the sake of Allah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for a Muslim female to marry a non-Muslim male.%0D%0AHowever, a Muslim male may marry only Christian or Jewish female. It is not%0D%0Apermissible for a Muslim male to marry any other non-Muslim female. This is%0D%0Athe law of Allah Ta'ala and, as Muslims, we express submission by simply%0D%0Aobeying Allah without questioning his order. However, every order of Allah%0D%0ATa'ala is full of wisdom.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe reason it is permissible for the Muslim male to marry a non-Muslim%0D%0Afemale is that he would be able to easily convince the Christian or Jewish%0D%0Awife into accepting Islam as she believes in a heavenly revealed. This is%0D%0Anot so for a Hindu or an adherent of any other religion. There is a%0D%0Apossibility of the non-Muslim male convincing his Muslim wife into%0D%0Aabandoning Islam. Therefore, Islam has considered her feminine nature and%0D%0Aprotected her correct beliefs from being a victim of abuse from the male%0D%0Adominance.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Muslim husband is not obliged to pressurise his Christian%2FJewish wife to%0D%0Aaccept Islam. He may apply wisdom and diplomacy and only influence her to%0D%0AIslam. In Islam, a female is equally respected as a male, however, due to%0D%0Athe different masculine and feminine natures, Islam believes in separation%0D%0Aof roles. It is obvious that there are many things a male can do, which is%0D%0Anot easily possible for a female and vice versa.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
