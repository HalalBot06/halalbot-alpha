  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it wrong for a woman to sleep nude, if she lives only with her husband, and is completely covered with sheets the entire night? Also, what is the correct way for a woman to do Sajdah? where should the legs be (to the side or under her) and should the toes be facing the direction of the qibla? Jazak Allah Khair\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said that, ‘Verily Hayaa (modesty) is\npart of Imaan.’ In principle, if a person sleeps naked covered with a sheet,\nit is permissible. However, some types of inner garments should be worn.\n2. Kindly refer below – Salaat of a woman.\n\nand Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Muhammad Kadwa\n\n18 – The Salaat of Women\nIn the Shariat, although certain forms of Ibaadat (worship) are done both by\nmen and women, yet the manner in which these forms of Ibaadat are fulfilled\ndiffer. This is especially apparent in Salaat. Many postures of the Salaat\nof women differ to that of men in order to maintain the very important\nprinciple of modesty and concealment. Many narrations substantiate this\nfact.\nHadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said: “When a woman sits in Salaat, she should\nplace the thighs (of one leg) upon the other and when she makes sajdah, she\nshould attach her belly to her thigh so that it is as concealing as\npossible. For indeed Allah Ta’ala looks at her saying: ‘O my angels I make\nyou witness that I have indeed forgiven her’.” (Baihaqi Vol.2 Pg.223)\nWaail bin Hujr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) says that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) said: “O Waail, when you commence the Salaat, lift your hands in\nline with your ears and women should (only) lift it in line with the chest\n(shoulders).” (Kanzul Umaal Vol.7 Pg.307)\nIn another narration, it is stated that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) passed by two women who were performing Salaat. He said: “When you\nmake sajdah, attach your body to the ground. Indeed women are not like men\nin this matter.” (i.e. they differ in the posture of sajdah). (Maraasil of\nImaam Abu Dawood (R.A))\nThe Imaams of all four Mazaahib (schools of thought) attest to the\ndifferences between the Salaat of men and women.\nThus, we will now discuss a few aspects pertaining exclusively to the Salaat\nof women.\n* Before commencing the Salaat, a woman must ensure that besides her face\nand wrists, all other parts of her body should be concealed. Some women\nperform Salaat with their hair exposed, others with their ears exposed,\nwhile the forearms of others are completely open. Some wear such a thin\n(see-through) burqa’ (head covering) that the hair can be seen through it.\nAll this is incorrect and not permissible\n* If any limb, besides the face and wrists are exposed for the duration it\ntakes to read thrice, the Salaat will be rendered null and void. If it is\nexposed less than that, the Salaat will be valid. However it will be makrooh\nand she will be sinful.\n* It is best for women to perform Salaat in a place that is most concealing.\nThus to perform Salaat in an inner room of the house will be better than\nperforming it in the front room or lounge etc. Similarly performing the\nSalaat in the lounge will be preferred to performing it in the courtyard of\nthe house.\n* Whilst saying the Takbeer-a-Tahrima (Allahu Akbar), women will only lift\ntheir hands till the shoulders and not till the ears like men. They will\nlift the hands under the burqa (veil). They should not take their hands out\nof the burqa.\n* Women will put their hands on the chest by placing the palm of the right\nhand over the back of the left wrist. The fingers should be kept close\ntogether. Women will not adopt the method of men in placing of the hands.\n(Tahtawi Pg.141)\n* Women should stand with both feet close together. There should be no gap\nbetween the two feet. In ruku also, the same position of the feet should be\nmaintained. (Bahishti Zewar & Mufti Taqi Uthmani)\n* First make the intention, then say Allahu Akbar. Thereafter place the\nhands on the chest. Then read Thanaa, A’uzu, and Bismillah after which you\nwill commence with Surah Fateha. On completing Surah Fateha, say A’meen.\nAfter that, read Bismillah again and read a Surah. After completing the\nSurah, say Allahu Akbar and go into ruku.\n* A woman should only bend so much in ruku that she is able to place the\nhands on the knees. Women will not make ruku like men by straightening the\nback. Their bending for ruku should be less than that of men. Place both\nhands on the knees while keeping the fingers closed together. Do not spread\nthe fingers apart. (Tahtawi Pg.141 & Bahishti Zewar)\n* Keep the forearms close to the sides and keep the ankles together in ruku.\n(Ibid)\n* In ruku, women will not keep the feet completely upright, but rather they\nwill bend the knees slightly forward. (Shaami & Mufti Taqi Uthmani)\n* Read three or five times in ruku. Ensure that the ‘dh’ is pronounced\ncorrectly.\n* After saying , lift the head and stand with ease and read or\n* Sahih Muslim\n* Women will make sajdah in such a way that the belly will touch the thighs\nand the forearms will touch the sides. The forearms will be placed on the\nground. Bahishti Zewar\n* Place the head between the hands in sajdah. Place the forehead and the\nnose on the ground. The fingers should be kept close together, facing the\nQibla. The thumb should also face the Qibla.\n* In sajdah both feet will be placed on the ground facing the right. The\nfeet should not be kept upright. However, the toes should face the Qibla.\nshould be read three or five times.\n* Thereafter say Allahu Akbar and sit with ease. Sit on the left posterior\nwith both feet protruding to the right. Place the right thigh on the left\nthigh and the right shin on the left one. (Tahtawi Bahishti Zewar)\n* Place both hands on the thighs with the fingers closed together. This is\nthe method for women. In ruku, sajdah and qa’adah, the fingers will be kept\nclose together without any gap in between, while the law for men is that in\nruku they will keep the fingers apart and in sajdah they will keep it closed\ntogether. In all the other postures, the fingers will be kept in their\nnatural position.\n* In jalsah the following duaa should be read, whether performing a fardh,\nsunnah or nafl Salaat.\n\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to read this duaa. (Tirmizi &\nAbu Dawood & Haakim)\n* Thereafter the second sajdah should be made in the same manner as the\nfirst sajdah was done. Thereafter stand up whilst saying Allahu Akbar. Do\nnot take support with the hands while standing up. Then read Bismillah and\nSurah Fateha. Upon ending Surah Fateha, say A’ameen. Thereafter Bismillah\nand a Surah will be read. (Behishti Zewar)\n* Sit in the qa’adah posture after completing two raka’ats. The manner of\nsitting is the same as that of jalsah. Read At-Tahiyat and when reaching\nAsh-hadu-al laailaaha illallaahu, join the small and ring finger and and\nattach their tips to the palms and form a ring with the middle finger and\nthe thumb. Lift the index finger, indicating to the oneness of Allah Ta’ala.\nDrop the index finger when reaching illallaahu. However the other fingers\nwill remain as is\n* If it is a Salaat of two raka’at, then maintain this posture till the end.\nRead the Salawaat (durood) and duaa and thereafter make salaam. If it is a\nSalaat of four raka’at, stand up immediately after completing the\nAt-Tahiyaat.\n* In the third and fourth raka’at also, read Bismillah before commencing\nSurah Fateha. If it is a Fardh Salaat, go into ruku after completing Surah\nFateha. However in the Witr, Sunnat or Nafl Salaat one will read a Surah\nafter Surah Fateha.\n* After completing the final qa’adah, say the salaam while turning the head\ntowards the right. Commence the salaam with the face in the direction of the\nQibla. Complete the salaam when the face is fully turned to the right. Then\nbring the face back towards the Qibla and commence the second salaam from\nthere. Turn the face towards the left as you say the second salaam. Do not\ncommence the second salaam whilst the head is turned towards the right. Face\nthe Qibla, then commence the second salaam. Whilst making both the salaams,\nmake the intention of greeting the angels.\n* It is Makrooh (reprehensible) for women to perform Salaat in jamaat\n(congregation). They should perform their Salaat individually. However if\nthe Mahram males (i.e. those men with whom one cannot get married eg.\nbrothers, father, grandfather etc.) are performing Salaat with jamaat in the\nhouse, a woman can join that jamaat. She will stand behind the men. She\nshould not stand in line with the men. (Mufti Taqi Uthmaani)\nWomen should read their five daily Salaat, Taraweeh and Witr Salaat\nindividually. It is Maakrooh Tahrimi for them to perform Salaat with jamaat.\n(Shaami Vol.1 Pg.418 & Fataawa Rahimia Vol.1 Pg.347)\n\nby Shaykhul Hadith Mawlana Fadhlur Rahmaan Azmi"
