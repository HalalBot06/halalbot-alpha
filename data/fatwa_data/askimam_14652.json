  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamu-alaikum\n\nI am 27 years old, I would like to know I have been seeing a Hindu girl for about a year. I really love her and want to marry her. Her parents accept me as her mother’s sister is now Muslim and my friend has a Muslim sister from another mother. The problem is my friend has not been expose to anything positive from Muslims. My parents and family know about us and they look down on her for she is a non- Muslim. Also her aunt that is now Muslim gets beaten by her husband all the time. Two of her friends that have converted to Islam, husbands have left them for other woman. One of her friends still practice Islam with the children as well. She seems not to have a problem with Islam as a religion and knows Muslims should be simple, peaceful down to earth people. She is faced with arrogance and superiority from other Muslims around her daily. Instead of showing her what Islam is about the warmth and friendliness, she is exposed to negativity from Muslims.\n\nI know we can only get married to Jews or Christians, and not Hindu’s. I would like to save her from the fire of Jahanaam and bring her into Islam. If we do get married and she remains Hindu and our children will be Muslim is this not better than her marrying a Hindu man and her children being Hindu. Certainly bringing Muslim children in this world is a good thing.\n\nPlease advise me on the situation I am faced with, as I need some light as to invite her to Islam without any force.\n\nRegards\n\n \n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nIn principle, logic will not be considered against an express order of Shariah. Shariah is based on wisdom, and has not considered the logic as explained by you. If we go by that logic, then it could extend beyond marrying a Hindu to have Muslim children. That could be achieved through adultery and fornication too. In this instance, would it be correct to state that it is better for a Muslim to have an affair with a woman and have Muslim children instead of her marrying a non Muslim or having an affair with him and having non Muslim children from him?\n\n \n\nOur advice to you is you invite her to Islam and identify Hindu women who accepted Islam and have a successful marriage. Let her see the positive side of Islam in practice. Unfortunately, she is exposed to the wrong practices of irresponsible Muslims.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
