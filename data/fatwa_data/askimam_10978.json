  "question": "Can a name be too heavy/burdensome for a person & if so should one change his name. The name in question is Muaawiyah.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe person with this name is 2yrs old & extremely difficult to manage.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe name Muaawiyah is the name of an illustrious and a great Sahaabi of Rasulullah (Salla Allahu Alayhi wa Sallam). It is a beautiful name and millions of Muslims have prided themselves by keeping the name of their children, Muaawiyah.\n\nIt is not clear who experiences difficulty in the name Muaawiyah. If it is the child, then a child of two years experiences difficulty in pronouncing anything, as the child is in the picking up stages of life. Adults surely do not experience difficulty in the name Muaawiyah. The name should be maintained and not changed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
