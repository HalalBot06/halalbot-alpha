  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-o-Alaekum I wish to ask the respected scholars that how to perform SAJDAH TALAWAH after reciting SURAH AL-ALAQ while leading SALAH BIL JAHAR. Should I go to RUKOO just after reciting the SURAH or go to SAJDAH first and then get up for RUKOO? Please quote references in answer. May ALLAH reward you for this.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAfter completing the Surah you should make Takbeer and go into Sajdah.\nAfter the Sajdah, you should come back to the standing position(Qiyaam) and further recite a few verses of the next Surah(Qadr) and then go into\nRukoo. (Shaami vol.2 H.M.Saeed)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
