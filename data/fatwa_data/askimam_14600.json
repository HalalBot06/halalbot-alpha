  "question": "which view should a muslim living in country other than saudi do, follow majority for ramadhan orfollow saudi for their timing?-",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nasalam alaykum\n\nwhich view should a muslim living in country other than saudi do, follow majority for ramadhan orfollow saudi for their timing?- is saudi like the main decision maker for ramadhan and islamic month for the world? why do so many people believe this, did the prophet (saw) make saudi as the criteria or where we live?\n\nan example is in uk where majority started their fast on sunday morning, while arabs and bengalis on saturday morning. they keep claming that we are supposed to follow the saudi for their timing, if thats the case why dont they just read salah according to their timing not in uk, why not read maghrib when it is asr for us?\n\nbased in quran\n\n\"...So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of)\n the month (of Ramadân), he must observe Saum (fasts) that month...\"\n\n[Holy Quran 2:185]\n\ni have read in hadith that\nIbn Umar (ra) reported that Allah's Messenger (pbuh) made a mention\nof Ramadan and he with the gesture of his hand said: “The month is\nthus and thus. (He then withdrew his thumb at the third time). He\nthen said: Fast when you see it, and break your fast when you see it,\nand if the weather is cloudy calculate it (the months of Sha'ban and Shawwal)\nas thirty days.”\n\nand\n\nKuraib (ra) reported that Umm Fadl (ra), daughter of Harith,\n sent him (Fadl, i.e. her son) to Mu'awiya (ra) in Syria. I (Fadl)\narrived in Syria, and did the needful for her. It was there in Syria\n that the month of Ramadan commenced. I saw the new moon (of Ramadan)\non Friday. I then came back to Medina at the end of the month. Abdullah b.\n 'Abbas (ra) asked me (about the new moon of Ramadan) and said: When did you\nsee it? I said.: We saw it on the night of Friday. He said: (Did) you see it\n yourself?-I said: Yes, and the people also saw it and they observed fast\nand Mu'awiya also observed fast, whereupon he said: But we saw it on Saturday\nnight. So we would continue to observe fast till we complete thirty (fasts)\n or we see it (the new moon of Shawwal). I said: Is the sighting of the moon\n by Mu'awiya not valid for you? He said: No; this is how the Messenger of\n Allah (pbuh) has commanded us.\n\n\nif thats case, why is there so much curuption regarding this? why do they not follow\nthe hadith of bukhari and muslim?\n\nand also, do non muslims go to heaven due to this quote\n\nThose who believe (in the Qur'an), and those who follow the Jewish\n(scriptures), and the Christians and the Sabians,- any who believe\n in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their\n reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.\n\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nThe Saudi procedure of commencing a month is completely out of line. It is not permissible to follow Saudi sighting whatsoever. Alhamdulillah, this year there has been a huge change in the many Masajids who used to follow Saudi have realized the folly of Saudis commencement of the month and changed. It is the responsibilities of every Muslim in the U.K to work towards this change and do not blindly follow Saudi. Those senior people who are silent at their folly are also guilty of misleading their public. A detailed article on this is on our alinaam site.  \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
