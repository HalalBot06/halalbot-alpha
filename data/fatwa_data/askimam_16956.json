It is also a Sharii right to serve ones parents.\n\nYou should discuss this issue with your husband and adopt a practical way of overcoming your difficulties.\n\nYour husband should inform his parents about his commitments and make them understand that he wishes to pay the loan as soon as possible to avoid the curse of Allah due to his interest deal.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
