  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs the intermixing of male and female permissble in case of education as iam in Â non-muslium country ,in order to gain knowledge ??\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is necessary for every muslim male and female to have that amount of islamic knowledge whereby they can carry out their deeni obligations and differentiate between Halaal and Haraam.Thereafter we can pursue our other studies as long as these studies are permitted in the Shari'ah. If possible you should try and complete our studies via correspondence .As a last resort it will be permissible for you as a male to attend college with a few conditions. Islam does not allow free intermingling with the opposite gender. Allah has placed a natrual inclination for members of the opposite gender.You should not be alone with any female/s as the Shaitan will mislead you to commit sin. You should command towards good, prohibit from evil,protect your gaze, tongue etc. from evil. Also fulfil all your obligations like your Salaah etc. punctually and to the best of your ability.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Maseehullah Kajee\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
