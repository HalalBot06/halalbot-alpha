There is no alternative to replace the Salaat. One has to perform it even\nif one is confined to the bed. One will be punished in Jahannam for 80 years\nwhere each day equal 1000 years of this world. (Fadhail-e-Aamaal). Such a\nperson will be forgiven if he repents and fulfils all the missed Salaats. He\nmust also fulfil all current Salaats on time.\n2. Is it necessary to throw yourself into the fire? Stay away from such an\nenvironment, study via correspondence.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
