  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nI have purchased a flat for R400 000 – I have thus far only paid R20 000. I have in my possession R150 000 – I am not sure if I am going to use this amount towards the payment of the flat or invest it elsewhere. I have taken a loan and the installments will only come into effect once the flat is ready – that could be in another years time. Do I pay zakkat on the R150000?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nZakaat is payable on the R150000.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
