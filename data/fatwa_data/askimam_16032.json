  "question": "It takes me a long while to complete my Salaah as i suffer from excessive discharge",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIt takes me more than 5 hours to offer ada, qada umri salaats and wudhoo(because i also suffer from excess vaginal discharge). I leave the Nafl and Sunnat Ghair mauqada, still i take more than 5 hrs. I have a small daughter to attend to. And I am hardly able to look after her and give her some amount of time. I know that one has to give proper time to rukoo and sajda. but what about the other duas?(1)Can i read surah fatiha, and the surah after it, tashahud and darood sharief in the namaaz at a fast speed? (2) How important is the pronounciation in namaz. ie. if i read the namaaz  fast, there is a little discrepancy in the pronounciation , ie. I say 'Waladaalin' instead of properly saying 'Waladdaalleen' because of fast speed. Also In India  everybody including me pronounces 'z' instead of 'dh'. Which alphabet in arabic is to be pronounced 'dh' and which is to be performed 'z'.  ie. do we say 'subhanarabial azeem' or 'subhanarabial adheem'?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nFrom what we understand from the query, it is possible that you are categorised as a ma’zoor; and the rules of Shari’ah are more lenient towards ma’zooors. However, you will have to observe if you qualify to be a ma’zoor or not. The process of confirming whether you qualify to be a ma’zoor or not is as follows:\n\nIf the fluid flows out continuously for one full time of salaah (its easier to observe at Maghrib time, as it is the shortest time), and the flowing does not stop for  the amount of time in which you could make wudhu and perform the fardh salaah, then you will be regarded as a ma’zoor. Once you become a ma’zoor, you don’t have to make the abovementioned observation for all times of salaah, but you will remain a ma’zur until the discharge of fluid stops completely, and not a drop is discharged for one full time of salaah.\n\nWhen you have confirmed that you are a ma’zoor, you will be required to make wudhu only once for every time of salaah. Once you have made wudhu for a particular salaah, you will also be able to perform qadha salaah and all sunan and nawafil with the same wudhu. The discharge of liquid during this time of salaah will not break the wudhu, nor will it be necessary to clean the impurity. The wudhu will only break once the time of salaah has expired. For example, if you make wudhu after the time of Zuhr has set in, then your wudhu will only break on the expiry of the time of Zuhr. However, if any other act that nullifies wudhu (e.g. passing of wind, etc.) takes place, then the wudhu will break as normal, as you will not be regarded ma’zoor in that act.\n\nOn the other hand, if you do not qualify to be a ma’zoor, then you don’t have any option but to make wudhu every time the fluid is discharged. Similarly, this fluid will be regarded as impure, the cleaning of the impurity will be necessary for the validity of salaah.\n\nوصاحب عذر من به سلس بول لا يمكنه إمساكه أو استطلاق بطن أو انفلات ريح أو استحاضة .....إن استوعب عذره تمام وقت صلاة مفروضة بأن لا يجد في جميع وقتها زمنا يتوضأ ويصلي فيه خاليا عن الحدث. وهذا شرط العذر في حق الابتداء ، وفي حق البقاء كفى وجوده في جزء من الوقت ولو مرة وفي حق الزوال يشترط استيعاب الانقطاع تمام الوقت. وحكمه الوضوء لكل فرض ثم يصلي فيه فرضا ونفلا  فإذا خرج الوقت بطل\n\nRaddul Muhtar Vol.1 Pg.305 (H.M. Sa’eed Company)\n\nوتتوضأ المستحاضة ومن به عذر كسلس بول أو استطلاق بطن لوقت كل فرض ويصلون به ويبطل وضوء المعذورين بخروج الوقت فقط ولا يصير معذورا حتى يستوعبه العذر وقتا كاملا ليس فيه انقطاع بقدر الوضوء والصلاة وهذا شرط ثبوته وشرط دوامه وجوده في كل وقت بعد ذلك ولو مرة وشرط انقطاعه وخروج صاحبه عن كونه معذورا خلو وقت كامل عنه\n\nHashiyat-u-Tahtawi ‘ala Maraqil Falah Pg.148 (Darul Kutub Al miyyah)\n\nFatawa Mahmodiyah Vol.5 Pg.224/5 (Jami’ah Farooqiyah)\nFatawa Uthmani Vol.1 Pg.365 (Maktabah Ma’ariful Quran)\n\nOur scholars have advised us with an easy way to do qadha umri. They explain that one should perform one qadha salaah before or after every fardh salaah. (E.g. one could perform his Zuhr qadha salaah after he has performed his Zuhr salaah for that day; and his Asr qadha salaah before he has performed his Asr salaah of that day; and do the same with the rest of the salaahs.) In this way, one will have exact knowledge of how many qadha salaahs he has made, and will not require too much time to do so.\n\nIf you adhere to the abovementioned, you will not require so much time to perform your ada and qadha salaah.\n\nAs far as reading at a fast speed is concerned, it is preferable to read at a moderate speed as it is emphasised in the Quran that one should read in a distinct and measured tone.\n\nورتل القرآن ترتيلا\n\nand recite the Qur‘ān clearly with tartīl (in a distinct and measured tone).\n\n(Verse: 73:4)\n\nHowever, if one reads at a fast speed, but still pronounces each letter as it is supposed to be pronounced and adheres to the other rules of tajweed, then it will be permissible. \n\n(Fatawa Mahmoodiyah Vol.7 Pg.44 – Jami’ah Farooqiyah)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
