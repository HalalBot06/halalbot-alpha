  "question": "I am an officially appointed Imaam at a Masjid. When visiting Ulama come to the Masjid, some trustees request them to perform Salaat without consulting with me.Is this correct?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAre they required to consult with me first.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShariah has emphasized in honouring and respecting the right of an%0D%0Aappointed Imam leading his congregation. We make reference to - among%0D%0Aothers - the following:%0D%0AAbu Masood (Radhiallahu anhu) states that no person should become the Imam%0D%0Aof a person in his place of leadership and no person should sit in the house%0D%0Aof a person at his special place but with his permission. (Mishkaat pg.100;%0D%0AMe?raaj)%0D%0AWhosoever enters the Masjid and he is more educated than the resident Imam%0D%0Athen too the resident Imam is entitled to lead the salaat. (Fatawa Hindiyya%0D%0Avol.1 Pg.2; Rashidiyya)%0D%0AIt is Makrooh-e-Tahrimi for another person to perform salaat without the%0D%0Aconsent of the official Imam. (AAP.KE. Masaail or US KA HAL Vol. 2 Page 234)%0D%0AIn view of the above it is clear that as the appointed Imam of the Masjid it%0D%0Ais your right to lead the congregation. However, you are at liberty to give%0D%0Apermission to a suitable person to lead the salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best.%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0A"
