  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it true that no one can go to Jannat without being baiyet(direct student) of a Wali. What if, one follows the direct rules of Qur'an and Sunnah and does amol(worship) accordingly without being a baiyet of anybody? We know that only Rasulullah (SW) can do safayet for his Ummat. Can any Wali do the same for his baiyet? Will it be a great sin if I do amal following the rules of Quran and Sunnah without being a formal baiyet of any Wali?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA person becomes Bay?at with a Wali for this reason that through his company and guidance it becomes easy to tread on the path of the Sunnah of Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] and obey the command of Allah. If Allah Ta?ala blesses someone with these qualities, then why should there be sin for not becoming Bay?at. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyah vol.15 pg.91)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn regards to Shafaa?at (intercession), even though Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] will be given the highest position of intercessorship, other beings will also be allowed to intercede. Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] has mentioned, ?Recite the Qur?aan, for verily, it will intercede for its recitor on the day of Qiyaamat.? (Muslim). Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] has further mentioned that the Hafiz who obeys the commands of Allah will be allowed to intercede for ten members of his family. (Ahmad). Similarly, the angels, martyrs, and pious servants of Allah will also be given permission to intercede for the believers.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
