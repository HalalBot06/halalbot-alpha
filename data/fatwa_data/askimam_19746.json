  "question": "Is it permissible to make use of pictures available online?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI sell health and beauty products online, most of my goods I buy are from Chinese websites. So, I take the photo available on the website and even from Google search where there is no copyright and most of the stores that sell the same products use the same photo. So am I doing wrong by taking these photos?\n\nIs it permissible to sell products which are not edible, i.e., health and beauty products, hair accessories, massager, exercise products, gift shop and office accessories?      \n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nIt is permissible to use photos available on websites and Google for the sale of your beauty products. The picture should not be of animated objects.   \n\nIt is permissible to sell all the products you referred to.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Zaid M Shelia,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\nIllinois, Chicago (USA)\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
