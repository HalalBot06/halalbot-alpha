You should continue deriving benefit from his discourses. If you wish to take bai’at on any spiritual guide, you should identify the person. If you have familiarity with him and you think you could benefit through him, then you should request his assistance in that regard. The closer the relationship with ones spiritual guide, the more one will benefit from his roohaniyyat and spirituality.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
