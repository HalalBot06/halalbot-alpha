Sajda is prohibited whilst the sun is rising; precisely at noon%0D%0Aand from the time the colour of the sun changes before sunset until the sun%0D%0Ahas fully set.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Hanafi method: It is Mustahabb (desirable) to stand up and say, 'Allaahu%0D%0AAkbar' without raising the hands, then go straight down into Sajdah and%0D%0Awhilst standing up say, 'Allaahu Akbar'. There is no Tasleem (Salaam) after%0D%0Astanding up. Although it is better to begin and end this Sajdah from a%0D%0Astanding position, it is also correct to commence and terminate it from a%0D%0Asitting (Jalsa) position.%0D%0A%0D%0ASajda is made by placing the two hands on the ground in line of the ears and%0D%0Aplacing the face between the hands. Sajda should be made on the forehead and%0D%0Anose. The underarm should be exposed by having the arms spread out. The%0D%0Athigh and stomach should also be separated from each other. The toes should%0D%0Abe made facing towards the Qibla and 'Subhaana Rabbiyal A'alaa' should be%0D%0Arecited thrice.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe procedure for women is different in that she should be more concealed by%0D%0Akeeping the thigh and stomach together.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
