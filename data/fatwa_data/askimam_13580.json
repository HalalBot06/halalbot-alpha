  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamu Aliakum,  JazakAllah Khairum for the answers that you give.  May Allah (SWT) reward you for this hassanah.  I am currently living in . It is a very small town, dominated by university students, basically a University town.  Alhamdullilah we have a Masjid here, run by the local Islamic Center board.  We have majority of Muslims from the Hanafi Fiqh at the moment.  One of the senior member of the community follows the Shaifee Fiqh, and always tries to impose his rules in the Masjid.  He belives the following.  I would like an authentic view on all of below mentioned points.\n\n“The Imam should be of Arab origin, because he can recite the Qura’an properly, and so that the Muktadis can understand clearly.”  What are the criteria of being an Imam?  As far as I believe he should follow the sunnah, have knowledge of salat, like the Fard and Wajibs in salat. \nHe insits on making long Jammaat, which consist of long rukhu's and long sajdah’s.  He says that in the Qur'an Allah has said that HE loves those who prostrate; does this mean that we should make long sujood, that too in Jamaat? And he always quotes hadith that RasulAllah (SAWS) made the prayer longer. \nIn Ramadan, we asked him to pray 20 Rakats as Salat Traveeh, which is Sunnat-ul-Muktadah according to all Fiqhs.  He argues that in Shafee it is not, and in midlle east they pray only 8. In our discussion, we decided that we will pray 8 rakats with him, he will read Qur'an (by looking at it, holding in his hand), and then continue the rest 12 rakats behind a Hanafi Imam, who will read surah’s rather than the Quran in hand.  Is this a possible soulution to our porblem?  Is a Hanafi’s salat valid under the shafee imam holding the quran and reading, and is it valid if a hanafi imam holds the quran and read it? \nSince most of us are students we have time constratins and the Shafee imam insist on praying 8 with reading 1 and 1/4 juz of the Quran, he thinks that the Quality is what maters in prayer?  Can you eloborate on this significance of Quality?\nCan you please explain what Imam Shafee has said about Traveeh, and how should it be performed, because to me 8 rakats seems to be bidah.\n\nPlease explain the above questions and concerns.\n\nJazak Allah Kairum. \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere appears to be a difference in the community. It is important that the community sits and resolves its diffrences in a mature and professional way. Providing proofs for ones views will never resolve the diffrences. The Imam and the responsible brother should be advised to take cognisance of the feelings of the congregation and not put people into unncessary difficulty. They should be told that the taraweeh should be conducted in a manner that attracts most Musalies and not become a means of them staying away from the musjid during the blessed month of Ramadaan.\n\nIt is Sunnat Muakkadah to perform 20 rakaats of taraweeh. In his book Shiekh Wahbah Az Zuhaili states that \"to perform 20 rakaats is the view of the Jumhoor Fuqahaa (including Imam Shafi) \". He further states that reading lesser than 20 was the independent view of Ibn Taymiyya (R.A). (Fiqhul Islam Wa Adilatuhu Pg. 1089)\n\nIn conclusion, we advise that the musjid committee finalizes the issue with mutual consultation and Mashwara. This will attract the mercy of Allah and become a means of the community uniting.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
