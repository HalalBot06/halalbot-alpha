  "question": "I am a 19/f thinking of not getting married because I do not favor overly sexual marriages unlike many men. I would prefer intercourse to be restricted mostly to procreation. Afraid to die alone.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy decision is one that has been taken seriously and after quite some deliberation. My ideal physical intimacy includes kissing and caressing but not sex unless greatly limited. I have also come to value my chastity a great deal and hesitant of losing it. My only fear is of dying and living safely alone and opinion of family but otherwise I am very comfortable with the idea. Even if I do decide to, I want to do it when I am ready and not because of family (parents want me to get married at 24) or other pressures.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has mentioned in a Hadith: \"O group of%0D%0AYouth! Whoever from you possess the means to maintain a wife then he should%0D%0Amarry.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AOur Beloved Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has also stated that he who%0D%0Aturns away from his sunnat is not from his group. From the above two Ahadith%0D%0Awe learn that to marry and have off-spring is a sunnat and has also been%0D%0Aencouraged in our Shariat. Allah Ta'ala mentions in the Holy Quraan: \"And%0D%0Afrom the signs of Allah is that He has created for you from your own type%0D%0Apartners so that you may find peace in them and He has created love between%0D%0Ayou.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AIf a person has confidence that he will not fall into sin if he does not%0D%0Amarry then it will not be necessary for him to marry immediately but if%0D%0Athere is a great danger of him falling into sin as is the condition%0D%0Anow-a-days then it will be necessary for him to marry and save himself from%0D%0Athe different avenues of sin.%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has also encouraged us to marry women who%0D%0Aare fertile and child bearing. One should also remember that intercourse%0D%0Abefore marriage is forbidden and a major sin.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
