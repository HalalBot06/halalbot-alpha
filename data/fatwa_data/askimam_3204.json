  "question": "When are we permitted to perform just the fardh of wudhu? Someone proposed to me but my parents say I should only get married once i finish studying which is in 3 years. What do i do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. According to the Hanafi Madhab, there are four Faraaidh in Wudhu and many\nSunnats. A person should try his level best to perform his Wudhu according\nto the Sunnah way. However, due to circumstances, for example, shortage of\nwater, etc. a person may suffice by fulfilling only the Faraaidh of Wudhu.\n2. If you have the patience to wait until then and will not engage in any\nprohibited act, you may follow the advise of your parents.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
