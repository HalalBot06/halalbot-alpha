  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDear Imam about a week ago my wife woke up around 12:15 pm crying saying that she felt something on her chest & she couldnt say anything.  She said that she heard something say im done with u now im going for him. (as in me).  We assumed it was a jinn & made whudu & prayed. Shukr till now we have had no incidence. Weve been reading Quraan, Ayatul Qursi ( which we have stuck on our walls as well) & the three Quls. However we still have  fear & not sure what really happened & cant seem to get good nights sleep.  We would appreciate any advice & also if anything else is further required for us to do.\n\nJazakalah\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYou and your wife should not worry about the incident. Just ignore the incident. Place your trust in Allah. Insha Allah, nothing will happen. Such incidents happen to many people. That is the mischief of Shaytaan. It creates fear in the hearts of people and try to distract them from their purpose of life.\n\nIf you pay attention to that incident, you are giving in to the Shaytaan’s motive and aim of distracting you. If you ignore the incident, the Shaytaan will feel despondent and not trouble you in future. At this stage, Shaytaan is happy as you are afraid. Continue the reading of Aayaatul Kursi, the four Quls every night. Also, try to be in the state of Wudhu as much as possible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
