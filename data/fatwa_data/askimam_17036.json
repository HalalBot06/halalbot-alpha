  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI'd like to know if Egg Donation is allowed in islaam\n\nThere's an organisation that harvest eggs, and then they give it to deserving women who are unable to concieve, after screening them carefully, they take religion, race and economic factors in to consideration.\n\nI would like to give something back to the world. I just feel so bad for women who are unable to conceive, I know so many of them and the heartache they go through just resonates within me.\n\nI don't plan on having a kid right, but I'm assured that when I do, the harvesting does not affect my chances of conceiving.\n\nPlease understand that my intentions are good, and it's a humanitarian effort on my behalf.\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is not permissible to donate your eggs to an organization to implant in a woman who cannot conceive. That is permissible only with ones wide with conditions. Kindly find attached our detailed fatwa regarding Invitro Fertilization.\n\nWassalam\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa\n\n \n\nInvitro Fertilization\n\nhttp://www.askimam.org/fatwa/fatwa.php?askid=cafb291de70da98ba0071ac0e9ca98f8"
