We agree with the advice given to you by the educated person. Hadith is a vast science with many rules and principles. A person who does not know the rules and principles of Hadith will be misled if he approaches the Hadith by himself. Every Hadith must be understood contextually and in a specific way. Obviously, that is the approach in any science. Nobody drives a car without knowing how to drive a car. Nobody operates a machine without knowing how to operate the machine. If there are two Ahaadith having apparent inconsistencies, how would a person not knowing the rules and principles of Ahaadith approach such Ahaadith?%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is human nature to suit oneself. Generally, in such a situation a person will choose a Hadith to suit himself. That is contrary to submission and subjugation, the very spirit and motivation behind Deen. We, therefore, advise that you discontinue with that practice. As an alternative, we conduct a Hadith programme two times a week, Tuesdays and Fridays. You may subscribe to that programme and circulate those Ahaadith to your friends and associates.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
