  "question": "reward for breastfeeding...i left breast feeding my baby less than in a year. Is that what i did was wrong. Will i get rewarded for the short time period i breastfeed my baby",
  "answer": "QUESTION\ni read somewhere that if the mother gets stress or tension while breastfeeding it'll affect the child later on. My inlaws used to blame me for one thing or the other & i used to worry & get tensed about it & couldnt help it. So i left breast feeding my baby less than in a year. Is that what i did was wrong. Will i get rewarded for the short time period i breastfeed my baby. Please pray for me & reply to me in detail.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe status of the mother is very high in the sight of Allah. Whatever she does for her child, she will be rewarded immensely for it.\n\nWe are not aware of the child being affected by being breastfed when the mother is under pressure or stressed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
