  "question": "What intention (niyat) should be accompanied with deciding to go for Hajj? should one visit everyone he/she knows 2 inform them of pilgrimage?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPeople go to extreme ends where they must have their families pack in their suitcases and give long emotional duas while doing so. also the tables must be decked and people must be entertained when people come greet before leaving. Also, should one visit everyone he/she knows 2 inform them of pilgrimage? Give big lunch before leaving and all that other stuff. Please advise.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Many customs prevailing nowadays in connection with the Hajis departing or arriving from Hajj are merely baseless traditions. There is no scope in Islam for such baseless rituals. There is no need to invite everyone for a meal before leaving for the Hajj journey. Yes, one may invite family members for a meal so that he can meet everyone at once. However, this is not a religious injunction.\n\n2. It is not necessary but advisable to visit his close family relatives before leaving for Hajj and to take their Du?aas.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
