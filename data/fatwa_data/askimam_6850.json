We, therefore, advise that as a wife you know best when and how to get across your husband. You have to exercise restraint and look for the best course of action to reform your husband.\n\nIt may be an idea to obtain the book, ?Virtues of Trade? by Shaykh Zakariyyah (RA) and pass over the information of honesty and truthfulness in trade and business to him. Remember, wisdom and diplomacy are the most efficient vehicles of success. Together with that, be patient and make lots of Du?aa. Also encourage your husband on other acts of piety. That may conscientise him to be honest in his practice of trade and business.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
