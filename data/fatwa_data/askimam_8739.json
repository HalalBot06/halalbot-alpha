We do not find any Du?aa or Wazifahs to see Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) in one?s dream. However, a person will see Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) through his piety and practicing on the Sunnah. %0D%0A%0D%0A2. If you are experiencing difficulty in memorizing any Surah or portion of the Qur?an, then one should perform four Rak?aats Salaah on Thursday evenings, preferably in the last portion of the night. In the first Rak?aat, after Surah Faatihah, you should recite Surah Yaseen and in the second Rak?aat Surah Dukhaan, in the third Rak?aat Surah Sajdah and in the fourth Rak?aat Surah Mulk. After performing the four Rak?aats you should recite the following Du?aa: %0D%0A%0D%0A?Allahumma irhamni bi tarkil ma?aasi abadam maa abqaytani warhamni an atakallafa maa laa ya?neeni war zuqni husnan Nazari fi maa yurdheeka ?anni. Allahumma badee?as samaawaati wal ardhi thal Jalaali wal ikraam wal ?izzatil lati laa turaam, asalooka yaa Allahu yaa Rahmaanu bi jalaalika wa noori wajhika an talzima qalbi hifza kitaabika kamaa ?allamtani warzuqni an atlubahu ?alan nahwil lathi yurdhika ?anni.

(Tirmizi, Vol. 2, Page 197)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. A husband cannot stay away from his wife for longer than four months without the permission of his wife. (Fataawaa Rahimiyyah, Vol. 3, Page 123-125) %0D%0A%0D%0A4. It is permissible for the husband and wife to look at each others private parts. However, one is encouraged not to do so for it weakens the memory and the eyesight. It is also against modesty. Aisha (Radhiallaahu Anha) narrates that: ?I never saw the private parts of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) nor did he see mine ever.? Aisha (Radhiallaahu Anha) also narrates that: ?I never saw the private parts of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)? (Mishkaat, Page 270, Hadith 66, Raddul Muhtaar, Vol. 5, Page 259) %0D%0A%0D%0A5. One should repent and abstain from this action in future. You should try to give some charity if possible. %0D%0A%0D%0A6. It is permissible to play cards as long as there is no gambling involved and it does not prevent one from fulfilling his Deeni obligations. (Raddul Muhtaar, Vol. 5, Page 279) %0D%0A%0D%0A7. There is no harm in singing this song as long as it is not accompanied by any musical instruments and immodest words. (Raddul Muhtaar, Vol. 5, Page 246) %0D%0A%0D%0A8.
