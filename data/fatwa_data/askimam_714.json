  "question": "What exceptions are there in Islam not to grow a beard?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nYou say that it is compulsory in Islam for a Muslim male to grow a beard. I really want to grow a beard but am being pressurised not to by my elder brother, who is very un-islamic. Whenever I merely mention the fact of keeping a beard he bitterly argues with me. I have even thought of moving away from him because of this, but this isn't possible. What do you suggest?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe objection of your brother to keep a beard is not an exception.\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'There is no obedience of a\ncreation in the disobedience of the Creator.'\n\nWe suggest you apply wisdom and diplomacy and start keeping a very small\nbeard.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
