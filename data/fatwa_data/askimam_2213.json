Can you please give me proof of all your answers to me please. Thank you for your time.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHereunder are the things that nullify Wudhu: a) To answer the call of\nnature, b) To pass wind, c) Emergence of any fluid from one's private parts,\nd) Passing out stones or worms, e) Blood or pus coming out, then flowing off\nthe mouth or the wound, f) To vomit a mouthful, g) To fall asleep when\nleaning against an object, h) To become intoxicated and unconscious, i) To\nlaugh aloud in any Salaat which has Ruku and Sajdah in it, j) For any other\nimpurity to come out of the body and flow off.\n\nHowever, the jurists have mentioned that it is preferable to repeat the\nWudhu after committing a sin. Hence, it is a sin to look at pictures of\nfamily members, to think of Haraam things, to sing American songs, to speak\nto men who one is not supposed to speak to, to show one's hair to Ghayr\nMahram males. Therefore, it is preferable to repeat the Wudhu in the above\ninstances.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
