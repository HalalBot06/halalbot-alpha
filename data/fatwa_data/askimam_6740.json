  "question": "Question regarding the separation of men and women in the mosque.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nJazakallah for the prompt reponses that you are giving to my questions. this is regarding the masjid that they are trying to have here in Sayre USA The thing is that they are not particluar about partition for women and men Please imam sahib can you tell me that how important it is to have partition I will show it to them otherwise they will not listen.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Qur?aan and Ahaadith are replete with the orders of Hijaab. Segregation of sexes is an integral part of the Deen and is proven from many sources of Shari?ah. %0D%0A%0D%0AThe negative consequences of intermingling or even non-partition between sexes is abundantly clear. In view of human nature being attracted to the opposite sex, it may be extremely difficult for them to lower their gazes which is an express order of the Qur?aan. placing a partition between males and females facilitates the lowering or non-looking at the opposite gender. The Musjid is a place to worship Allah and gain spiritual upliftment. Casting gazes to the opposite gender is death to spirituality, thus, defeating the very purpose of coming to the Musjid. %0D%0A%0D%0AIt is the responsibility of the trustees to adhere to the Shari?ah and endervour to achieve the aims and objectives of the Musjid. The attendants should feel a change of environment and spirituality in the Musjid. It should not be the same as going to any ordinary gathering. Such changes will be in the interest of the people and the trustees themselves. Taqwa and piety should be our code of life.%0D%0A%0D%0APlease note that we did not comment on females attending the Musjid.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
