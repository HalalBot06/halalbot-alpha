  "question": "Can single women own property and live independently...Can I purchase property and live on my own?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am single 26 yr old woman. I live at home with my parents and 3 siblings who are also in their 20s. I have a good job and can afford to support myself. Although I would like to get married, this has not happened, and my parents expected me to be married at this age. Can I purchase property and live on my own?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Aqeeqah is a Sunnat and should be practiced.\n\n2. It is preferable to do the Aqeqah on the 7th day. Thereafter, on every subsequent 7th day - 14th, then the 21st day, etc. If ones Aqeeqah had not been done, then he/she may offer a sacrifice later in his/her lifetime.\n\n3. The Aqeeqah of a boy is 2 goats or sheep and for a girl is 1 goat or sheep.\n\n4. If one cannot afford to sacrifice 2 goats or sheep for a boy, then even 1 goat or sheep will suffice. However, if one cannot afford any animal at all, then he does not have to do Aqeeqah. He may give some Sadaqah of whatever he can afford.\n\n5. Aqeeqah and Qurbaani meat have the same law. One may distribute it to whomsoever he wishes and may consume it himself. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyah part11 pg.342)\n\nand Allah Ta?ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
