  "question": "Can we do Wudhu if the Satr is open?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni need to ask you that can we do a wudhu if satr is not complete or proper?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nWudhu done while the satar is exposed is valid. However, the satr should not be exposed in front of other people, as that is a sin.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
