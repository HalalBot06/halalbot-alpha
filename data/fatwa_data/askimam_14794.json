  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAsalam u ALAKUM\n\n                 I AM IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE THAT I HAD MET IN SCHOOL. We both want to get married but there is alot in the way. We have proceeded to make our relatoionship halal.. for fear that we will not end up together. One of the many things that is standing in the way is his family. I AM a bit older than him.. less than a year i might say. His family thinks of me as a joke because of my age. There are other attributes such as my physical features and money involved. My question is... is there anything in Islam that says anything about age and marriage? And if you have any advice on how to make the situation better please let me know. Thank you\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYou should discuss the matter with the seniors of your family. They know you will info rm them about the boy and his family’s attitude towards you. Your family will be in a better situation to guide you. You should also make Istikhara.\n\n \n\nIn the meanwhile, do not associate with the boy. Bring the courage and distance yourself from him now. If the relationship becomes deeper, it will be more difficult to do so. Besides that, the relationship with the boy is haram and a major sin. How can you expect the mercy of Allah upon you when you violate the orders of Allah.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala knows best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
