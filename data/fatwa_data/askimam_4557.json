  "question": "Is it true a person in the masjid can walk in front of a person in the state of salaat provided the masjid is a certain length?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person is performing Salaat in a big Musjid then it will be permissible\nfor one to walk across at least 2 or 3 Saffs in front of him. If it is a\nsmall Masjid / Musalla, then it will not be permissible to walk in front of\nhim at all. If the size of the Musjid is 235 square meters, then it will be\nconsidered to be big and if less then small. (Ahsanul Fataawa vol.3 pg.409;\nHM Saeed)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
