  "question": "Somewhere here you said Salafis are same as Sunni but astray but they say that Imam Ash'ary is not Muslim so can you kindly explain that?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAbul Hasan al-Ashari was an Imaam of Aqaaid (Ilm al-Kalaam). He deduced on\nthe beliefs of the Ahlus sunnah Wal Jamaa in the light of the Qur'aan. Those\nthat claim he was not a Muslim have erred and are responsible for the\nattribution of Kufr to a sincere believer.\n\nThey should support their claim with proofs and we shall answer them\nthereafter.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
