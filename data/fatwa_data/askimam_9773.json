  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am supposed to work 9 to 5, but I come late like 10 am and go early like 4.30 pm and also during most of time I waste surfing internet. Anyway when I am told to do something I never lag behind. Nevertheless my conscience pinches me if the money I earn will be halal or haram. My boss never tells me anything and he knows the situation very well but does not object. Moreover I am not alone in this behavior quite a few are culprits of that. Secondly, I make excuses in my mind of my behavior like I am doing it because I am paid less than I should have been (which is in fact true), I do not take lunch for 1 hour (which is also true), I do not take other brakes as others take like tea, etc. Now do you think in the eyes of Allah I will be forgiven.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, we must point out that Islam teaches honesty and%0D%0Atrufthfulness. Dishonesty and lies are major sins and incurs the wrath and%0D%0Aanger of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is compulsory for you to adhere to the rules and principles of your%0D%0Aemploymet. Turning up late and turning off early from employment on your own%0D%0Awithout the consent of your employer and receiving full remuneration is%0D%0Aembezzlement. As an employee, the time you give is a trust. Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'A sign of a Munaafiq is when he is%0D%0Aentrusted, he embezzles'.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is also misappropriation of trust to use the employer's facilities%0D%0Awithout his consent. Being paid less or working during lunch hours cannot%0D%0Ajustify the wrong you are engaged in. As an alternative, discuss the matter%0D%0Awith your employer. Request him for an official leeway to work during tea%0D%0Abreak and lunch time in compensation for arriving late and leaving early.%0D%0AAlso, seek his consent for using his facilities. If he permits, then only%0D%0Ayour actions will be proper. If he does not permit, adhere to the rules of%0D%0Aemployment and set an example of honesty and truthfulness to your fellow%0D%0Acolleagues. It is these morals that will take you far in life with dignity%0D%0Aand honour.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
