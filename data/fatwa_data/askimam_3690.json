  "question": "Can we make dua with washila of the Prophet s.a.w or pious person ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected mufti saheb. Jazakallah khair for your great service for the ummah. I have one confusion here is that. Usually in India at the end of dua we say \"YA ALLAH HUJUR S.A.W. KE SADAKE TUFAIL ME MERI DUA KABUL FARAMA\". Is it permissible? If yes can you give me some proof. If no, then there is a hadith I have read in fazael-aamal. that \"ADAM A.S. MADE DUA TO ALLAH BY THE WASHILA OF PROPHET S.A.W AND IT IS ACCEPTED\". What this hadith means. Please can you give me authentication of this hadith from where it is borrowed.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTawassul (to seek a medium) is proven from Qur'an and Hadith. Allah Ta'ala\nsays, 'O you who believe! Fear Allah and seek Waseela to Him.'\n\nHadhrat Umar (Radhiallaahu √Ånhu) sought rain during drought through the\nWaseela of the Prophet's Uncle. However, due to people trespassing the\nlimits of Waseela and there is fear of committing Shirk, it is advisable to\nabstain from Tawassul. Any permissible act which may lead to Shirk also\nbecomes prohibited.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
