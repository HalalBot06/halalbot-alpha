  "answer": "QUESTION\nBecause of this certain members of my family are still keeping a grudge against them. Even the small children have begun to dislike this family friend and his family. I have advised my family members that they should just forget that these friends did not attend as im sure there was a good reason as to why they could not make it to the funeral. other members of my family keep no grudge but keep saying that will forget that these friends did not attend the funeral, but they will NEVER forgive them. Could mufti saheb please advise\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAttending the funeral of a friend's relative is not imperative. It is up to\nthe individual to decide whether he wishes to go or not. It is grossly\nunfair for the family members to bear a grudge against this family friend\nsimply for not attending the funeral. He, probably, had a valid excuse.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
