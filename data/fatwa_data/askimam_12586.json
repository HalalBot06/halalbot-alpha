  "question": "Is the using of dry-cleaners permissible?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it permissible to clean ones clothes at the dry-cleaners?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to our understanding, commercial dry cleaners use one washing chemical for many washes. The chemical is not changed after every wash.\n\nIf an impure garment is put in such a lot, it will not become pure. In fact, the other clothes in the same lot will become impure.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
