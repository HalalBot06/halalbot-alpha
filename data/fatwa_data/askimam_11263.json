  "question": "My wife does not have feelings for me please tell me dua to bring happiness in life",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI had my nikah 3 years ago but got married last september, and my wife came here 2 months ago. During three years we were only in contact via phone or internet. Since she has come here she does not have same feelings towards me as I do. I tried to ask her several times why is that and she did not say any thing. Later I found out that she had an internet affair with some one I confronted that with her but she denied that and said that it was for fun only. I even don?t have much problem with it. She has told me once that she does not have any feelings for me and I am not attractive to her. When I try to show love to her she trys to avoid me and physical contact which make me really frustrated. Can you please tell me if there are any dua's which make me calm and more patienced and help to bring happiness in my and her life. Thanks and regards Waslaam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for writing to the institute about the state of your marriage.\n\nIt appears to be a trying period for you at the moment. May Allah Ta'ala make it easy for you and may He grant peace, love and harmony in your marriage. Ameen.\n\nIf you do not mind, please tell me why you had to wait for so long before your wife could join you. Where was she before she joined you? Was this an arranged marriage? Has she in any way indicated to you that she was forced to marry you or that she had plans to marry someone else? What was her attitidue towards you when you had contact over the phone and the internet? Did she indicate in anyway that she was unhappy about joining you or that she would prefer not to join you at all?\n\nHave you asked her why she finds you unattractive and not lovable? What do you think the problem could be? An education gap, social gap etc? I await your response.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best.\n\n1Social department"
