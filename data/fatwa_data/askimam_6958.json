  "question": "1) Till what time can we say Asr prayers. I have heard you shouldn't pray Asr after it is round about 30 minutes left for magrib. Upto what time can I pray Asr? Can magrib be prayed till Isha?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAsr time will remain until sunset. However, it is Makrooh (undesirable) to offer Asr Salaat when the colour of the sun changes and the sun?s rays change to yellow.\n\nIf due to some reason one gets delayed, Salaat in this Makrooh time should be offered and not allowed to be missed. In future, it should not be delayed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
