  "question": "Prophet Muhammed (saw) cursed those women who plucked their eyebrows",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nYou say Allah does not like those who alter their looks, But how comes women can stop having children or not have them at all just to keep her figure nice for her husband when having a kid is such a big issue in Islam. so what is wrong with plucking bushy eyebrows just to look beautiful for your husband. Not having kids is a major step, becasue you wont be able to pass on knowledge to the younger generation, nor get a chance to know what its like to be parents, but plucking eyebrows is seen so harmful if you do it for your husband.what if the husband runs away from the wife who is put off completely by her eyeborws(cos they can make a women look manly), should she still not pluck?Please answer according the the question asked and specifically.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0AYour understanding that a woman can practice birth control to maintain her%0D%0Abeauty and shape for her husband is incorrect. Kindly refer to%0D%0AContraceptions - below%0D%0A%0D%0AAs regards plucking eye brows, that is prohibited by Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam). The above are general rulings and certainly does not mean%0D%0Athat Shari'ah does not take into cognisance circumstances.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AQ: Are contraceptions permissible?%0D%0AA: Contraception (Azl) is permissible on a limited scale for valid reasons -%0D%0Areasons considered by the Shari%E1h to be valid. The circumstances which will%0D%0Apermit reversible and permanent contraception differ.%0D%0AReversible contraception: Among the reasons accepted by the Shari%E1h as valid%0D%0Afor practising reversible contraception are: a) Physical weakness.b)%0D%0ASickness.c) The wife maintaining her beauty or figure for the sake of her%0D%0Ahusband. d) The couple being on a journey or in a distant land. e) Adverse%0D%0Apolitical conditions, e.g. children are forcibly separated from their%0D%0Aparents as is advocated by communism; etc. f) The couple decide to separate%0D%0Ain the near future. g) The wife is an immoral person.%0D%0AThere are valid grounds for practising reversible contraception. Poverty or%0D%0Athe fear of poverty are not valid reasons for contraception. It is not%0D%0Apermissible to practice contraception on account of a fear of not being able%0D%0Ato provide for a large family. Such a fear is an attribute of non-Muslims.%0D%0AAccording to the Qur%E3n Shareef: 'There is not a living creature, but its%0D%0Asustenance is the responsibility of Allah.' Similarly desire to curb sexual%0D%0Adesire which may stem out of piety is not a lawful ground for contraception.%0D%0AIf practised for any reason which is unlawful in Islam, then contraception%0D%0Awill likewise be unlawful, e.g. for indulgence in illicit sex.%0D%0APermanent contraception is permissible only if the woman's life is in danger%0D%0Aor her health is seriously threatened.%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Sa%E9ed Khudhry (RA) reports that one person asked Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) about Azal (Coitus Interruptus). Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) replied, 'When Allah Ta%E3la intends creating a%0D%0Achild, nothing can stop him.' (Mishk%E3t pg. 275; Qadeemi)"
