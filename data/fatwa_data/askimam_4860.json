  "question": "I have observed that the people of Tablighi Jamaat regard Maulanas Thanwi, Zakariya and Ilyas r.a. as next to Rasulullah and the Sahaba. Who are these individuals and why are they regarded this way?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWith due respect to these Ulamas, I don?t understand why their names are mentioned in majority of the Bayaans, Taleems, etc. and their?s seem to be the only books read, or as it appears, allowed to be read.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThese were illustrious Ulama of the last century who played leading roles in\nthe development and enhancements of Islamic spirit amongst the masses of\nIndia. They have also authored a number of books on diverse topics. One of\nthe books authored by Shaykh Zakariyya (RA) is Fadhaail-e-Aamaal. Extensive\nuse of this Kitaab is made by members of the Tabligh Jamaat in their Taleemi\nprogrammes. This is why they quote him so frequently in their Bayaans.\n\nMoulana Ilyaas Saheb is quoted so frequently simply because he was the\nfounder (or rather the reformer) of the Tablighi movement. These Ulama quote\nfrom the Qur'aan and Hadith or they commentate on the Qur'aan and Hadith.\nHence, when people quote them, they are actually quoting a commentary of Qur\n'aan and Hadith.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
