  "question": "Can they take part in such foreplay",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamulaikum Mufti sahab, I have three questions\n1) can a husband touch, insert his fingers in her wife\\'s private parts during foreplay.(Is this act considered as modesty).\n2) can a husband put some jam or honey on his wife breast and some other parts (not on private parts) and lick from there.(Is this act considered as modesty).\n3) can a husband put his private part in between his wifes breast and between his wifes buttocks during foreplay.(Is this act considered as modesty).\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAlaah Ta’ala says in the holy Quran; “Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth when and how you will”. (02:223)\n\nThe need for intimacy between spouses is natural.  However, it should be fulfilled with shame, modesty and dignity.  Whilst foreplay is permissible, the other issues referred in your e-mail are extremely disrespectful.\n\nSharia emphasizes on shame and modesty. \n\nNabi (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) said; The door to all virtue is modesty”. ( Muslim, Vol. 2. Pg.48. Maktaba Thanwi Deoband )\n\nModesty is part of iman (faith). (Bukhari, Vol.2.Pg.203 Qadimi kutub khana)\n\nThe Ulama have stated that modesty repels one from disgraceful and repugnant things.\n\n(Daleel-Al-Falehen-Li-Turuqi-Reyad-As-Salehen, Vol.3. Pg 149-150)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Safraz Mohammed,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
