  "question": "Validity of Salaat behind a person who makes Masah on Regular Socks",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Sb, Assalam U Alaikum If I know that a person makes Masah on regular socks and he is leading the prayer what should I do when, a. I have seen him making masah just before he went to lead the salaat. b. I have not seen him doing Masah myself for this salaat, (so there is a chance that he might have washed his feet for this particular salaat.) Do I have to repeat my salaat in both the cases or just in case a? Am I allowed to follow him in Salaat to avoid Fitnah? What should be my intention (Nafil Vs. Fardh) in case a, when I know for sure that he has made Masah on regular socks? Jazak Allahu Khairan\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nYou should request your Imaam to consider the convictions of the other\nMusallees and facilitate for them by washing his feet in Wudhu. If he does\nnot accept your request and there is no other Musjid nearby, you should join\nthe congregation and repeat your Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
