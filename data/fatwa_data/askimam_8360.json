  "question": "I want to marry someone. But she doesn't like me. What should I do ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu Alaikum. I really liked a girl because she is really virtuous. I told her about my feelings that I like her but she said...\"life is a test nothing real..\" and not to act on my emotions. That was when I was about 15. It's been 2 years since then and we moved to different places. But I still really love her...because she is also a good muslim. We don't have contacts with each other but my feelings stays still the same about her. I don't think she likes me, but I do want to marry her...then again I am too young and she is about 2 years older than me. What should I do ? Should I be patient about it? Or should I give up the truth that I liked her ? I told her that I only liked her because she was pious...Have I comitted a sin telling her about my feelings ? Please give me an advise. Thanks. Assalamu Alaikum.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe suggest you approach this situation in a more realistic manner:\n\n1. A girl not having interest in you, what will your plight be at the end of the day?\n\n2. A girl who is elder than you, what are the implications.\n\n3. Is this your feelings and emotions that are allowing you to become who you are?\n\n4. Will your patience solve your predicament or forgetting about her completely.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
