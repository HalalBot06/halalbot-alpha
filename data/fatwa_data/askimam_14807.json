  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI realy want to have a baby and have not been sucessful.  Can you please give me some duas or advice.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n   May Allah assist you in your difficulty. It is a fact that such decisions are in the hands of Allah alone, and Allah decides if and when to bless anybody with this bounty. As such, plentiful Dua and abstinence from the prohibitions of Allah are extremely essential. Among the various Duas a person may adopt in this situation, the best and most beneficial is Istighfaar (seeking forgiveness for ones wrongdoings). In the Quran’e Kareem, being blessed with progeny has been enumerated under the benefits of Istighfaar (Surah Nooh, Verse 12). One should, therefore, engage in frequent and abundant Istighfaar.\n   Furthermore, since this world is one of cause and effect, it is possible that failure to conceive could be due to a medical reason. Therefore, one may employ all forms of Ja’iz (permissible) medical treatments to assist in removing this difficulty. However, in that case too, Dua should never be neglected.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
