  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWe have received a query in respect to the Disposal of Blood by abattoirs & slaughterers of animals slaughtered.\n\n \n\nThe correct dumping (based on City Guidelines) of this is generally an expensive exercise. If not dumped in the prescribed manner the blood emmits a pungent and unbearable smell.\n\n \n\nDue to this some abattoirs process this blood into Pet Food and others sell this to non-muslims for human consumption.\n\n \n\nPlease advise the shariah ruling on this.\n\n \n\nA muslim owned abattoir has request that he wishes to sell or give this to a non-muslim for processing into pet food. Any income (it any) generated from this would be donated to the needy without the intention of reward.\n\n \n\nWhat is the shariah ruling in regard to this.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to the Shaafi’ee and Hanafi Madhab, it is not permissible to sell blood. (al-Haawil Kabir vol.6 pg.460; Darul Fikr – Hidaaya vol.3 pg.49 Ashrafiyyah)\n\nHowever, it may handed over to processing only plants for disposal purposes.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
