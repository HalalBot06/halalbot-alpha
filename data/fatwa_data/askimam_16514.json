  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs per Hanafi School of Thought, it is not permissible to eat any kind of sea food but which fall under the categoriy of pisces (fishes). Please provide the hadith evidence of above fact.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nWe are Muqallideen and followers of Imaam Abu Hanifa (rahimahullah).We strictly adhere to his rulings and trust his Ilm (knowledge) for he was a great Muhaddith and a Faqeeh. At the same time we respect the rulings of the other Fuqahaa.\n\nThe Hanafi school of thought permits the eating of fish only. The following Hadith is used to substantiate this:\n\nاحلت لكم ميتتان.........السمك و الجراد\n\n“Two types of dead animals are made halaal for you: (1) the fish and (2) the locust” (Majma’ Al-Zawaaid, vol 1, pg 238, Al-Qudsi)\n\nFrom the above Hadith we understand that all carrion meat, whether of the land or sea are prohibited except the fish and locust. The exception specifically of fish serves as an indication that there is a difference in ruling between fish and other creatures of the sea.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
