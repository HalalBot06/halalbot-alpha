  "question": "People tell me there is no evidence in any madhabs of wearing pants above ankles. the beard they say that Maliki madhab only has a goatee or hair around mouth and chin and not whole beard as minimum",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSomeone told me that nowhere in any of the four madhabs is that we have to wear our pants or izar above our ankles. Is this true? If it is then but there are hadith which say to do this, so I am confused whether we should do taqleed or what? As well as the beard they say that Maliki madhab only has a goatee or hair around mouth and chin and not whole beard as a minimum, so what is a maliki to do when discussing the beard according to hadith we must not shave so what is this I am confused whether to do taqleed of the madhab or follow hadith.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe assumption of this 'someone' is inaccurate.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe prohibition of this deed according to the Hanafi Madhab could be found%0D%0Ain Shaami vol.6 pg.351 and Fataawa Hindiyya vol.5 pg.333%0D%0A%0D%0AAmong the Shaafi'ee, great scholars such as Imaam Nawawiy and Haafiz ibn%0D%0AHajar (RA) have also mentioned the severity of this deed.
