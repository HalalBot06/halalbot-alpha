  "question": "Is getting an immoral and characterless husband a punishment from Allah for some sin that I'm not aware of?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMay Allah bless you all for providing this platform to people like us to get our answers.\n\nMy family got me married last year through a website but later found out to my shock that the guy and his family had deceived us by posting complete false information. He was a drunkard, characterless, did not pray a single namaz, was mentally unstable psycopath. In order to save myself the disgrace of being called a divorcee I was prepared to undergo all kinds of torture and did not tell anyone about this.It reached a point where I had lost the power to think or act. Then one day, I still beleive as if, Allah only showed me the way, and I got divorce from him.\n\nMy question is however not related to the above.\nBy Allah's grace, after the divorce, i got the opportunity to perform Hajj with my parents.\n\nI was taking pills to postpone the periods but unfortunately on EXCATLY the first day of hajj the periods started. As I got completely nervous I started taking double doses of the same pill hoping to stop the periods but unfortunately it went on and i had to RETURN BACK WITHOUT PERFORMING the TAWAAF e ZIYARAT.\n\nI would be obliged if you can let me have your wisdom on the following:-\n1. Is getting an immoral and characterless husband a punishment from Allah for some sin that I'm not aware of?\n\n2. Why did not Allah let me be a Haaji? Has Allah punished  me further by not letting me complete all the arkans of Hajj and come back NOT BEING a Haaji?\n\n2. Alhamdlillah and Insha Allah I plan to go in the coming Hajj again to complete the tawaaf e ziyarat and also perform a second Hajj, if only Allah wishes so.\n\nNow between, if by Allah's wish I get married so will that be OK without non-performance of the Tawaaf e ziyarat? (I'm asking this as I know that the relations bet husband and wife are not allowed till all the Hajj arkans are performed and Ihram restrictions follow)\n\n3. Do I have to give a damm' or fidya even if I do not get married?\n\nOnce again may Allah shower his rehmat on you for the good work that you all are doing.\n\nAllah Hafiz\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nA1&2.\n\n { وعسى أن تكرهوا شيئا وهو خير لكم وعسى أن تحبوا شيئا وهو شر لكم }\n\nAllah Ta’ala says:\n\nIt could be that you dislike something, when it is good for you; and it could be that you like something when it is bad for you. Allah knows, and you do not know. 2:216\n\nWe regret to hear of your past. However the reward of the hereafter is eternal and better then the temporary difficulties of this world. Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم said: \n\nوعن أبى هريرة عن النبى - صلى الله عليه وسلم - قال « ما يصيب المسلم من نصب ولا وصب ولا هم ولا حزن ولا أذى ولا غم حتى الشوكة يشاكها ، إلا كفر الله بها من خطاياه » صحيح البخارى\n\n“No hardship, pain, worry etc afflicts a Muslim until a thorn which pricks a person except that Allah by virtue of that forgives his sins.”\n\nA3. If one did not perform Tawaf-e-Ziyara, he/she is still considered to be in ihram. It is permissible to marry in the state of ihram however; it will not be permissible to consummate the marriage. If one has physical relations in ihram then a budna (cow or camel) will also be wajib together with the damm which is wajib for delaying Tawaf-e-Ziyara.\n\nA4. Damm for delaying Tawaf-e-Ziyara will be wajib. You should also note that it is not permissible for you to tie a new ihram for Hajj or Umrah before completing your Tawaf-e-Ziyara.\n\n(Ahsanul Fatawa 4/558 H.M.Saeed)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
