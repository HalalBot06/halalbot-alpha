  "question": "2)Some people in my family fold corner of the cloth on which we stand to pray. They say that if we don't fold the carpet, then shaitaan jins will come and pray on it. 3)Was Rabiya of Basri married?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)Is it okay to wear a 'taaweez'? Taweez is a sacred kalaam (from Quran) written on a piece of paper, and then sewn into leather and is worn in the neck or on the arm. (There is no shirkiah thing written in it), so is it allowed to wear that for purposes such as 'dua' or for marriage etc.? Please let me know. 2)Some people in my family fold the corner of 'Jaa-e-Namaaz' (The cloth on which we stand to pray), after they've finished their prayer and the 'Jaa-e-namaaz' is still lying there. They say that if we don't fold the carpet, then shaitaan jins will come and pray on it. Please verify if this custom has any basis in the shariah or wether this custom is a biddah? 3)Was Rabiyya of Basra (Rehmatullah Illaiyh) married? In a khutbah by a scholar i heard him say that she was married, while in a book written on her life by Margaret Smith, she says that Rabiya wasnt married, please give the right information. Please also give some details about her life.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Kindly find below our standard reply to similar queries - Taweez.%0D%0A2. We have not found any basis and proof for such a practice. If this was%0D%0Athe case then what about the carpet which is fitted and stack onto the%0D%0Aground upon which Salat is offered? How is one supposed to 'fold' that?%0D%0A3. We have not cited any mention of her being married in the authentic books%0D%0Ain which her biography is documented. Hafiz ibn Khalliqaan has recorded an%0D%0Aincident in which her refusal to accept a proposal for married is mentioned.%0D%0A(Wafaayan al A'ayaan vol.2 pg.286)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta%E3la says in the Noble Qur%E3n, 'In the Qur%E3n is (spiritual, physical)%0D%0Acure for people.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThe opening chapter of the Noble Qur%E3n, Surah Faatiha is also called the%0D%0Achapter of Shifaa. It is recorded in the Bukhari Shareef vol. 1 p. , 'A%0D%0Aruler of a certain clan was stung by a creature, the people of the area%0D%0Arequested the Sahaaba to cure him, one Sahaabi read Surah Faatiha and blew%0D%0Aon the affected area and cured the ruler. The Prophet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam) even praised the Sahaabi for doing so.%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the above quotations, it is clear that the verses of the Noble Qur%E3n is%0D%0Aa means of cure. Treating oneself with Taweez containing verses of the Qur%E3n%0D%0Ais similar to treating oneself with medication. By using medication, one%0D%0Amerely places his trust in Allah Ta%E3la and use the medication as a means of%0D%0Acure. The effect in the means is with the Will of Allah Ta%E3la so, too is the%0D%0Ausage of the Taweez.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe art of making Taweez is a science independent to other known sciences.%0D%0APeople who have studied this science are most knowledgeable to explain its%0D%0Avast understanding. One thing must be outlined at the outset is that anyone%0D%0Apractising the making of Taweez cannot ascribe (in his method and%0D%0Aapplication) partners with Allah Ta%E3la. Any act of Kufr is unacceptable in%0D%0AIslam.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe people during the time of Jaahiliyya had an incorrect belief that the%0D%0Astars and planets cause rainfall, but the Prophet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam) dismissed that. The drawings and illustrations used in Taweez are%0D%0Alike the concepts used in geometry, etc. to arrive at a solution.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn conclusion, consider the following Hadith: Abu Khuzaymah (Radhiallaahu%0D%0A%C1nhu) narrates from his father that he asked Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam), 'Inform me about Rukan (blowing in water and Taweez), medication,%0D%0Aand means of security, does it change Taqdeer (predestination)? He replied,%0D%0A'They (all the above) are within Taqdeer. (Mishk%E3t pg. 22)"
