  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI lost my baby at 36 weeks pregnancy.unknown causes.what does the hadith and qur'an say regarding this child and the parents and please give some nasihat for encouragement.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nWe are sorry to hear about your recent miscarriage.  May Allah Ta’ala grant you sabr in this hardship, Ameen.  One of the qualities of a believer is that he/she practices sabr when difficulties befall.  Allah Ta’ala says in the Qur’an:\n\n \n\nالَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُمْ مُصِيبَةٌ قَالُوا إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ \n\n(Those who exercise sabr are) those who, when any difficulty befalls them they say, “Verily we belong to Allah and to Him shall we return. (Al-Bakarah 156)\n\nThis verse is a clear indication as to how one should react in times of sorrow.  Practice sabr and have yaqeen that Allah in reality has only taken what belonged to Him.  Only Allah knows the wisdom in His actions and we should have firm believe in taqdeer.\n\nImam Muslim in his Sahih narrates: \n\n أم سلمة زوج النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم تقول سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول ما من عبد تصيبه مصيبة فيقول إنا لله وإنا إليه راجعون اللهم أجرني في مصيبتي وأخلف لي خيرا منها إلا أجره الله في مصيبته وأخلف له خيرا منها قالت فلما توفي أبو سلمة قلت كما أمرني رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فأخلف الله لي خيرا منه رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم\n\nUmme Salama (Radhiyallahu Anhu), the wife of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam), said that she heard the Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) saying “There is no servant (of Allah) who is afflicted with any difficulty and he recites\n\n \nانا لله وإنا إليه راجعون اللهم أجرني في مصيبتي وأخلف لي خيرا منها\n\n(Verily we belong to Allah and to Him shall we return. O Allah, reward me in my difficulty and give me in return better than what I had)\n\n \nexcept that Allah rewards him in his difficulty and gives him in return better than what he had.”  Umme Salamah says, “When Abu Salamah (previous husband) passed away, I recited the dua.  Allah in return gave me better (husband) than Abu Salamah, the Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam). \n\nOn practicing sabr, Allah Ta’ala rewards his servants tremendously.  Imam Tirmidhi in his Sunnan narrates the following Hadith:\n\nعن أبي موسى الأشعري أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال إذا مات ولد العبد قال الله لملائكته قبضتم ولد عبدي فيقولون نعم فيقول قبضتم ثمرة فؤاده فيقولون نعم فيقول ماذا قال عبدي فيقولون حمدك واسترجع فيقول الله ابنوا لعبدي بيتا في الجنة وسموه بيت الحمد) قال أبو عيسى هذا حديث حسن غريب  ، و صححه ابن حنان)\n\nِ\n\nAbu Musa Al-Ashari narrates that Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) said: “When a person’s child passes away, Allah Ta’ala asks the angels “Did you take my servant’s child?”  The Angels reply “Yes.”  Allah Ta’ala asks then, “Did you take the fruit of his heart away?” The Angels reply “Yes.”  Then Allah asks, “What did my servant say?”  The angels reply “He praised you and recited inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon.”  Allah says, “Built a house for my servant in Jannah and name it the House of Praise.”  \n\nAllah Ta’ala makes the child intercede on the behalf of the parents until the parents are made to enter Jannah. Imam Muslim in his Sahih Narrates:\n\nAbu Hassan reported : I said to Abu Huraira (Radhiyallahu Anhu)that my two children had died. Would you narrate to me anything from Allah's Messenger (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) a hadith which would soothe our hearts in our bereavements? He said: Yes. Small children are the fowls of Paradise. If one of them meets his father (or he said his parents) he would take hold of his cloth, or he said with his hand as I take hold of the hem of your cloth (with my hand). And he (the child) would not take off (his hand) from it until Allah causes his father to enter Paradise. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Tamim with the same chain of transmitters. And he is reported to have said: Did you hear from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) anything which may soothe our heart in our bereavements? He said: Yes. (Muslim Book 32, Number 3670)\n\nThe Fuqaha have stated that the child which passes away from miscarriage will also have this honor. (Rad Al-Muhtar 2:228, H.M. Saeed Company) \n\nفائدة سأل بعضهم هل يكون السقط شافعا ، ومتى يكون شافعا ، هل هو من مصيره علقة أم من ظهور الحمل ، أم بعد مضي أربعة أشهر ، أم من نفخ الروح ؟ والجواب أن العبرة إنما هو بظهور خلقه وعدم ظهوره كما حرره شيخنا زكريا\n\nMay Allah Ta’ala make it easy for you in these hard times and grant you great reward for your patience.  Ameen.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nEhzaz Ajmeri,\n\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
