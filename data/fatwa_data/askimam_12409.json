  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf your relatives are such that by you not attending, they would feel hurt and there is hope that they would stop the un-Islamic functions in order to make him attend. Or if he hold such a position that if he attends, other would use his attendance as proof that it is permissible to attend such functions, then it is not permissible for such a person to attend.\n\nHowever, if your attendance or inattendance will not affect the manner in which these functions are held, then you may attend the permissible aspects of the function but it will not be permissible to be present at the impermissible aspects. In every situation, one should try his utmost to rectify the situation. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyah vol.7 pg.815)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nPS.
