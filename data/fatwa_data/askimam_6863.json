  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen I pray I usually have money in my pocket which has a picture of the queen is this allowed. Also On fridays in the mosque when collections are made the money collected is put to one side and the Jummah is performed so the money is in the same room where the jamat is being performed is the jummah or salah valid? If it is not how can I approach the Imam or council as the mosque council consists of elders and I do not want to be disrespectful. Also I usually pray at home because the mosque is too far away so only read in a jamat a few times a week, this means I have to read in the same room as my mum and as she reads sitting on a chair she sits diagonally in front of me of me but we do not read in a jamat is this okay or shall I read in another room?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Salaat performed with a picture of an animate object on money in the pocket is valid.\n\n2. There is no prominence given to the picture on the money.\n\n3. You may perform Salaat with your Mum in Jamaat in the same room.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
