  "question": "Interpretation of Istikhara Dream",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy wife and I have been having marital problems for the last 2,5 yrs. We went to an Aalim who suggested we see an Aamil as he suspected sihr. This was confirmed by the Aamil we chose. However things still havent changed. I have now read Istikhara salat and asked my Granddad who is pious to read on my behalf as well seeking an answer as to whether i should try to make the marriage work. I had the following dream I was in the Musjid and surrounded by ppl who used to be gangsters and changed and next to me or in front of me was my brother in law, it was the time of jumuah salat and ppl were getting into the saf, the musjid was the one in my home town and not were my brother in laws hometown. My grandads dream was as follows he was walking with a loaf of bread in his hand and he passed by 3 black women. As he passed these women the bread fell from his hands. He then picked up the bread, however he left on slice behind and walked on. Jazzakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBoth the dreams have negative indications.\n\nHowever, we advise you also consider the feelings in your heart after making\nIstikhaara. If you are uncertain, you should continue with the Istikhaara as\nwell as make Mashwara (consult) with reliable people.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
