  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n  \n\n\n \n1) Can you kindly tell me if the following is correct or not. My ustaad (teacher) had a very minor accident. The bill list was given to him to pay as he was at fault. And I don’t know if he has money or not but he said this to me, “I have some Zakah money, ill give it to you and then you can pay my bill.”\n\nIs that jai’z (permissible?)??? \n\n \n\n2) How heavy can a men’s silver ring be up to??? \n\n 3) Can you please tell me of a dua’ that will help in my bad temper.\n\n 4) I since a young age wanted to become a muhaddith and a hafiz, can you tell me of a dua which I can read that may support my memory and that may help what I have learnt in the past strong.\n\n 5) I am very concerned about my older brothers who are not good Muslims. Can you make dua for them and tell me of an effective was to give them Da’wah.\n\n 6) My non Muslim friend said that religion is old now and its modern time now so why is it necessary nowadays? But he believes very briefly that there is a god. So how I answer his question.\n\n 7) Last but not least, my female teacher said why do you keep your eyes down? I know it’s for haya and the Quran states us before the women, so what can I say to her.???She is keen to learn more about the beauty of Islam…..may Allah taa’la give me hidayaah and her. Please make dua for I am the weakest of all.\n\n \n\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1.  What is meant by Zakat money? Does he have to discharge his personal Zakat? Did somebody give him Zakat money for himself or to distribute?\n\n2. It is not permissible to have a silver ring heavier than 4.373 g.  A ruler, judge, or an official may use a ring as seal.  That will be Sunnah for them.  For others, it will be merely mubaah (permissible).\n\n ( قوله ولا يزيده على مثقال ) وقيل لا يبلغ به المثقال ذخيرة . أقول : ويؤيده نص الحديث السابق من قوله عليه الصلاة والسلام \" { ولا تتممه مثقالا } \" الى قوله أقول : قول الاختيار : التختم سنة لمن يحتاج إليه كالسلطان والقاضي ومن في معناهما صريح في ذلك\n\nرد المحتار (6:361)  ايج ايم سعيد كنبنى\n\n \n\nذكر في الجامع الصغير وينبغي أن تكون فضة الخاتم المثقال ، ولا يزاد عليه وقيل : لا يبلغ به المثقال وبه ورد الأثر ، كذا في المحيط إنما يسن التختم بالفضة ممن يحتاج إلى الختم كسلطان أو قاض أو نحوه وعند عدم الحاجة الترك أفضل ، كذا في التمرتاشي\n\nالفتاوى الهندية (5:335) مكتبة رشيدية\n\n \n\nبادشاہ قاضی اور متولی وغیرہ کو مہر لگانے کیلۓ انگشتری چاندی کی جائز ہے جس کا وزن چار ماشہ سے کم ہو اوروں کیلۓ مناسب نہیں\n\nفتاوی محمودیہ (5:97) \n\n \n\n3. At the time when you become angry recite اعوذ بالله من الشيطان الرجيم  (I seek refuge from Satan).  Imam Muslim in his Sahih narrates, that two people were quarreling in front of Rasullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam).  One of them starting to get angry and his face turned red.  The Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) said “I know of a sentence if he were to say it, this anger would disappear اعوذ بالله من الشيطان الرجيم .”  Also if you are standing, you should sit down. If you are sitting, you should lie down.  Drink cold water to suppress the anger.  In other words he should remove himself from the sitiuation which created the anger or do acts which will slow his response and give him time to think instead of acting upon the rage of the anger.\n\n \n4. To improve your memory the following dua is very beneficial.  It was prescribed to Ali (Radhiyallahu Anhu) when he complained of his weak memory. The method of dua is thus:\n\nOn a Thursday night, wake up in the last portion of the night. If the last portion is difficult, then wake up the middle of the night.  If that too is difficult, then the first portion of the night.  Preform four rakat in such a manner that in the first rakah you recite Surah Al-Fatiha and Surah Yaseen. In the second rakah Surah Al-Fatiha and Surah Al-Dukhan.  In the third rakah Surah Al-Fatiha and Al-Sajdah.  In the forth rakah Al-Fatiha and Surah Al-Mulk.  After completing the Salah praise Allah and send salutations upon Rasullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) and the rest of the Prophets.  Ask for forgiveness for all the Muslims and all those who passed away with Iman.  Then at the end recite the following dua:\n\n \nاللَّهُمَّ ارْحَمْنِي بِتَرْكِ الْمَعَاصِي أَبَدًا مَا أَبْقَيْتَنِي وَارْحَمْنِي أَنْ أَتَكَلَّفَ مَا لَا يَعْنِينِي وَارْزُقْنِي حُسْنَ النَّظَرِ فِيمَا يُرْضِيكَ عَنِّي اللَّهُمَّ بَدِيعَ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ذَا الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَامِ وَالْعِزَّةِ الَّتِي لَا تُرَامُ أَسْأَلُكَ يَا أَللَّهُ يَا رَحْمَنُ بِجَلَالِكَ وَنُورِ وَجْهِكَ أَنْ تُلْزِمَ قَلْبِي حِفْظَ كِتَابِكَ كَمَا عَلَّمْتَنِي وَارْزُقْنِي أَنْ أَتْلُوَهُ عَلَى النَّحْوِ الَّذِي يُرْضِيكَ عَنِّيَ اللَّهُمَّ بَدِيعَ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ذَا الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَامِ وَالْعِزَّةِ الَّتِي لَا تُرَامُ أَسْأَلُكَ يَا أَللَّهُ يَا رَحْمَنُ بِجَلَالِكَ وَنُورِ وَجْهِكَ أَنْ تُنَوِّرَ بِكِتَابِكَ بَصَرِي وَأَنْ تُطْلِقَ بِهِ لِسَانِي وَأَنْ تُفَرِّجَ بِهِ عَنْ قَلْبِي وَأَنْ تَشْرَحَ بِهِ صَدْرِي وَأَنْ تَغْسِلَ بِهِ بَدَنِي فَإِنَّهُ لَا يُعِينُنِي عَلَى الْحَقِّ غَيْرُكَ وَلَا يُؤْتِيهِ إِلَّا أَنْتَ وَلَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللَّهِ الْعَلِيِّ الْعَظِيمِ\n\n(Tirmidhi Chapter Dua for Hifz)\n\n5. Inshallah we will keep brothers in our duas.  You should give your brothers dawah in a gentle way. Do not be too harsh on them.  The best dawah is by showing them good character.  Actions speak louder than words.  Be kind to them and remember them in your duas in all occasions. Try taking them to gatherings where lectures about Islam are conducted or make them participate in effort Tabligh Jamat.\n\n6.  Religion is not a fashion that it becomes old upon passing of time and is discarded.  Islam is way of life.  Allah Ta’ala is the Creator of mankind and has infinite knowledge.  He chose Islam to be the accepted religion till the Day of Judgment.  Allah did not choose this religion only for a certain era or group of people, but instead Islam it a universal religion for all people no matter what their race and for all times not matter how developed they become materialistically.  These “modern times” do not affect Islam and its teachings in anyway.  The purpose of Islam is not to become developed in the material world (nor does is discourage from it), but its purpose is to recognize Allah and worship Him, and live out our lives in a manner Allah has ordered us to.  Your friend says he believes briefly that there is a god.  The quality of God is that he is All Wise and All Knowing.  Therefore he has to believe that if a religion is accepted in God’s eyes for the people till the Day of Judgment, then verily is will be practiced upon in every era. \n\n7.  It is very good you lower your gazes from you female teacher.  May Allah Ta’ala give you steadfastness on your actions.  Tell her that these are the teachings of Islam.  Islam teaches us to have modesty and that a person should lower his gazes from strangers of the opposite gender.  If she is keen on learning more about Islam, you can give her a book on the teachings of Islam for example “What is Islam?” By Maulana Manzoor Nomani.  You can also tell her to visit the womenfolk in your family so they may explain more about Islam.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
