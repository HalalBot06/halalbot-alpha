But you can not pass urine in the place where you take bath.   We surprised to hear this. We shall appreciate your advising us if it is true according to sharia….  Thank you and Jzakamulla khairun.       Nazir -Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh.  \n\nIslam is a complete and comprehensive religion. Its teachings, philosophies and instructions are contained in the Quran and Hadith. Both (Quran and Hadith) serve as a guidebook and manual for Muslims. The decision of a Muslim ought to comply with this guidebook and manual. To understand the system of Islam, the example of a judge would be appropriate. The decision of a judge would be acted upon in the court of law as long as it is in conformity with the book of law. If not, his decision would be rejected. Similarly, the decision of Muslim would be accepted in the court of Allah Ta’ala as long as it is in conformity with the Quran and Hadith. If not, his decisions would be incorrect. Therefore, it is of great importance that our decisions conform to the teachings of the Quran and Hadith. Decisions of this nature will surely draw the Barakah (blessings) and Rahmah (mercy) of Allah Ta’ala.\n\nIslam advocates the honour and chastity of women and has never allowed their integrity to be dampened. Allah Ta’ala has prohibited men from casting lustful, filthy glances on women and has instructed men to lower their glances before them. Women are special creations of Allah Ta’ala meant to be concealed, honoured and taken care of and not left as objects of attraction for men. Allowing them to loiter and linger around in public is in reality dishonour to them. Women are not meant to satisfy the passion of strange men, rather they are meant to satisfy their husbands. Allah Ta’ala addresses women in the Quran with the following words:\n\nوَقَرْنَ فِي بُيُوتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ الْأُولَى \n\n“Remain in your homes, and do not display (your) beauty as it used to be displayed in the days of earlier ignorance” (Al-Ahzab, 33)\n\nAs Rijaal (men) and leaders of families, it is our duty to act on the command of Allah Ta’ala, protect the chastity, respect and honour of our women and not allow them to be victims of filthy glances of men. Muslim mothers and daughters are the pride of this ummah and never should we allow their chastity and honour to be streaked.  Rasulullah (Sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) has mentioned:\n\nوالرجل راع في أهله وهو مسؤول عن رعيته\n\n“A man is shepherd of his family and would be questioned regarding his flock” (Sahih Bukhari #853)\n\n\n\nIn view of the above, we reply to your query:\n\nIn allowing women to take up air hostess jobs, the following unislamic activities are observed:\n\n Travelling without a Mahram\n\nIt is not permissible for women to travel without a Mahram. (a male companion with whom marriage is Haram).\n\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) has mentioned:\n\nلا تسافر المرأة إلا مع ذي محرم\n\n“A Woman should not travel without a Mahram” (Sahih Bukhari #1763)\n\n \n\nThe Fuqahaa (Jurists) have stated:\n\nولا تسافر المرأة بغير محرم ثلاثة أيام وما فوقها\n\n“A woman cannot travel for three days or more (i.e.78km or more) without a Mahram” (Al-Fatawa al-Hindiyya, vol 5, pg 366, Rasheediyya / Al Muheet al-Burhani, vol 8, pg 114, Idara Al-Quran)\n\nFurthermore, it is expected of an air hostess to be appealing to the passengers. That is expressed by them applying makeup, smiling to one and all and obviously the dress code of an air hostess is meant to fulfil such unislamic expectations.\n\n \n\n Fear of Fitnah\n\nA young girl that is unmarried and without the company of a Mahram will certainly be tested with temptations and caught up in the snares of Shaytan during her journey. It is the duty of the parents to protect the chastity and honour of their daughter. We have been reliably informed by people in the industry about how they tempt air hostess and air hostess tempt them while being abroad.\n\n In light of the above, it is abundantly clear that it will not be permissible for a woman to take up the job as an air hostess. Surely, at the time of necessity, there are other permissible avenues for women to earn a livelihood. They could possibly work or engage themselves in some occupation from home. It will also not be permissible for the parents to allow their daughter in taking up this job.\n\n \n\nIn response to your second query, we state:\n\nWe are unaware of the opinion stated to you by your friend. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to urinate in the bath tab. From the Hadith, we understand that such an act creates doubts in the mind of a person. It is stated in a Hadith:\n\nأن النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم نهى أن يبول الرجل في مستحمه وقال إن عامة الوسواس منه\n\n“Rasulullah (Sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) has prohibited that a man urinates in the area he takes a bath. He further stated: Verily majority of doubts are from this action” (Sunan Tirmidhi, vol 1, pg 12, HM Sa’eed)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\n \n\nConcured by:"
