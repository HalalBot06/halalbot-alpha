  "question": "How to have an increase in faith and tears question?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu Alaikum #1) Sometimes my faith is so high that i dont care about the dunya or what people are doing, then suddenly it decreases and i start caring about this world, and dont pray namaaz earliest stated time. i do pray earliest stated time when my faith is high. How can i keep my faith always high, as the friends of Allah do? I already know the basics, such as faith increases and decreases as this happens to everyone, but i do not want my faith to decrease so low that i miss prayers and such, i want to be at the status of the friends of Allah, what to do? #2) Is this true: When tears come out from your eyes during namaz or reciting quran, where ever the tear touches, does that part become unlawful to the flame of hellfire? Example, if i cry during worship and rub my tears all over my face, will my face be unlawful to the flame? JazakAllah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'A person is on the path of\nhis friend.' (Mishkaat).\n\nA human being is generally influenced by his associates. If his associates\nare pious and sensitive to matters of Deen, then that quality will have an\neffect on the person. We advise you befriend pious people and stay in their\ncompany. That will assist you to be steadfast on maintaining the level of\nyour Imaan by carrying out good deeds and performing Salaat, etc. timeously.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
