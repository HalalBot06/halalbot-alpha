  "question": "I've given up listening to music but family is making it difficult...can you advise me what I should do",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have this problem and I need your Islamic advise. I have given up listening to music and i have no temptation or intention to go back to this habit. But my family members listen to so much music that it is penetrating in the whole house. I usually have to wear ear plugs 24/7 but even then the music penetrates into my ears. My family members know perfectly well that music is haram and that I have given it up but they still go ahead with blasting music in the house. Please can you advise me in what I should do because I feel guilty whenever I listen to music as if I am angering Allah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta?ala says, ?Call to your Rabb with wisdom and good advices?.\n\nYou know your family well. You should adopt any suitable method to stop them from music. If a soft attitude will be effective, adopt that. If a hardline attitude will yield benefit, then that will the wisdom referred to in the Qur?aan. We advise you ponder upon the two approaches ? soft and hard ? and determine which approach will assist you in achieving your objective. It is also important for you to set aside some time everyday when all the family members are present and read some Ahaadith about death, life after death, etc. That may assist them to realise the importance of life and preparing for the hereafter. Fadhaail-e-Aamaal of Shaykh Zakariyya is very effective for that. Also Riyaadhus-Saaliheen of Imaam Nawawiy (RA). Make Du?aa to Allah Ta?ala as much as possible. If you have Fikr, Allah will assist you in changing the family.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai</"
