  "question": "Respected Imam, Assalamo Alaikum, Alhamdolillah I and the girl (my fiancée) are Muslim. We got engaged 2½ years ago. But now my mother doesn't want me to marry her. Please refer me any DUA,ZIKR etc",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nOur marriage was planned in December 2000. Everything was running fine. After 1½ year of engagement, suddenly the situation changed and my mother disapproved me to marry her. According to my assumptions, first reason was that my family is quite Narrow Minded and hers Broad Minded. Secondly, my Mother wants to talk a lot with anyone, whereas hers is reserved, which enforces my mother to think that they are very rude people. My mother is just assuming that after marriage my fiancée will force me to live separately, not in a combined family. These small problems created a very big clash between our families. She has considered me everything for her and I really love her. I also love my mother very much and don?t want to leave her. I can do anything for her even can die for her. But I also love my fiancée very much and don?t want to leave her at any cost, after spending 2 years with her. One more thing I would like to mention you that now-a-days I am performing some WAZAIF and is sincerely praying ALLAH for our marriage. Now I just believe in one thing that ALMIGHTY ALLAH is only now able to help me. I just want my ALLAH to make my mother?s heart soft and she would allow me to marry her and allow her to live together. Allah has given you a chance to help people and to enlighten their ways in the light of Holy Quran and Sunnah. I plead you to kindly find out the way (any PRAYER, WAZIFA, WIRD etc.) by which my problem will be solved by the grace of ALLAH. Wassalam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe purpose of Nikah is to attain peace. For that, you should ensure that\nyou do not get embroiled in a dispute between your mother and your future\nwife.\n\nThat will lead you to grief as you love both of them. If you fear that, you\nmay make Istikhaara and seek Allah's guidance. You should also inform your\nmother that you will decide according to the guidance through Istikhaara as\nAllah's guidance is the best.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
