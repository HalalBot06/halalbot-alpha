  "question": "Can Muslims have a recreational center consisting of swimming pool and tennis courts, if males and females are allowed on seperate days?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe recreational center consists of an Olympic size swimming pool, a small wading pool for children under 5 years of age, two tennis courts and a picnic shelter. The whole facility is surrounded by trees and is in a very secluded area. Additionally we have put up a 6-foot wooden fence around the swimming area to ensure further privacy.Is a facility like the one stated above in accordance with Islamic principles? If not can something material be done to make it confirm to Islamic principles?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe do not see any apparent violations of Shari'ah in the proposed procedure\nof using the recreational centre.\n\nHowever, the responsible persons should ensure strict implementation of the\nproposals of non-intermingling, etc. Females (Muslims and non-Muslims) must\nnot wear any swimming costume which leaves private portions of the body,\nbreasts, legs, etc. uncovered. Since the garments will be soaked with water\nand sticks to the body, females should be advised to use dark colours to\navoid revealing their bodies to the best of their abilities.\n\nWe advise a female, who is conscious of the laws of Hijaab and proper code\nof conduct be appointed to strictly supervise the use of the facility.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nBy Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
