  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question is regarding the strength of my Imaan and jannah. I pray 5 times a day Masha Allah but these days I am feeling demotivated towards fulfilling my religious obligations. I feel like no matter how much good deeds I do and no matter how much I pray I would not be granted entry into Jannat UL FIRDOUS and think that even if I were to be granted entry into the lower level jannah, then i will always feel remorseful and will suffer from inferiority complex in my Jannat when I will see the upper levels of Jannah and their inhabitants. All these thoughts put me off from praying and reciting the Quran. Please help me and tell me how to deal with this dilemma and to strengthen my Imaan. Please reply in as much detail as possible.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe concern regarding the strength of your Imaan and Aakirah is a sign of your Imaan. Only a person, whose connection with Allah is strong, will experience such thoughts.\n\nThe feelings you are experiencing are the whispers of Shaytaan. He uses these types of plots to frustrate people and force them to give up their religious practices. He injects different types of doubt and suspicion that eventually misleads one away from the right path. You should therefore ignore these whispers of Shaytaan and continue with your normal routine of performing Salaah and reciting Quraan etc. This is also a test from Allah upon you. You should remain steadfast and committed without neglecting your duties to Allah. Once you are successful in this test, Allah will open up such opportunities upon you that you will stare in surprise.\n\nEvery Mu’min will certainly enter Jannah. The last Mu’min to enter Jannah will enjoy a paradise that would be ten times the size of the universe (Tirmizi Vol.2). Therefore, continue with your Salaah, Zikr, and recitation of the Quraan, Allah will bless you with Jannatul Firdous. It is also important that you confide in Alim of your community. Seek his advice and take his guidance on matters you do not know. In this way you will strengthen your Imaan and the whispers of Shaytaan will be dispelled.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
