  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf I want to make dua at Haram Sharif for marriage to particular girl (we are engaged before but it is breakup from  there side )it is ok\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nInstead of making du’ā to marry this particular girl, you should rather make du’ā that Allāh Ta’ālā helps you choose a pious girl and makes it easy for you to marry her.  Additionally, you may pray salāt al-istikhārah, asking Allāh Ta’ālā to make your marriage with her possible if it is better for you and to make you content in not marrying her if it is not good for you. \n\nIn the end, you should be pleased with the decree of Allāh Ta’ālā and know that it was best for you.  Allāh Ta’ālā says,\n\n \n\nكُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْقِتَالُ وَهُوَ كُرْهٌ لَكُمْ وَعَسَى أَنْ تَكْرَهُوا شَيْئًا وَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ وَعَسَى أَنْ تُحِبُّوا شَيْئًا وَهُوَ شَرٌّ لَكُمْ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ (البقرة: 216)\n\n…Perhaps you dislike something while it is good for you, and perhaps you like something while it is bad for you.  And Allāh knows and you do not know (Qur’ān 2:216)\n\n \n\nMay Allāh Ta’ālā make it easy.  Āmīn.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
