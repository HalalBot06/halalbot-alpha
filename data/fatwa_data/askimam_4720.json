  "question": "Please interpret the following recurring dreams, and should I change my name?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamAlaikum, Although there are a few gaps where some teeth once were, I still have many teeth intact. In other dreams, the onset of the end of the world is looming, with people panicking and fleeing. I, too, experience much dread at the prospect of hell. I've also had several dreams where shaytan is chasing after me. As I try to escape, I continually recite shahadah or aoudobillah (can't remember), and for a while he retreats. But then he begins to close the gap on me again, and despite my frantic recitals, he approaches nearer and nearer. The dream ends there, without him actually having caught me. Another recurring, but less frequent dream, is that I'm swimming in sparkling crystal pale blue water, at which I feel much peace and tranquility. Finally, I'm female and my name is Munazza (sic). Should I change it? If the name Munazzah is a synonym of one of the names/attributes of Allah (swt), then why is there a feminine equivalent of the name, i.e Munazzaha?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The dreams are a reflection of the strength of your faith and that Allah\nwill grant you peace and happiness.\n2. We suggest you change your name.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
