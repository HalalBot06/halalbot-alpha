  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Mufti Sahib, Q.1. Please provide with Ahadees regarding beef, it's benefits or disadvantages. Q.2. How do we distinguish as to which fish are allowed to eat and which aren't? Q.3. Is there any Qari who has recited the Quran in all the seven dialects? If yes, are there any cassettes or CDs available? Thank you very much. May Allah Ta'ala bless you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n%0D%0A1. Hadhrat Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'The best amongst food is meat, both in%0D%0Athis world and the hereafter.' Hadhrat Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates,%0D%0A'O people! Take to eating meat. And eat it often for it heals the throat,%0D%0Aclears the skin and keep the stomach small (prevent one becoming%0D%0Apotbellied).' Hadhrat Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu) also says, 'He who does not%0D%0Aeat meat for 40 days, may have his throat affected.' Hadhrat Abu Hurayra%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Asaid, 'The eating of meat brings much pleasure.'%0D%0A2. From seafood, only fish is made Halaal for us. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) said, 'Two carions are made Halaal for us; Fish and locust.%0D%0A' (Mishkaat vol.2 pg.361). Fish is classified as a Vertebra. Shrimps and%0D%0Alobsters are not vertebras, hence, not permissible. Some Ulama are of the%0D%0Aopinion that shrimps, etc. are fish, therefore, permissible. Due to the%0D%0Adifferences of opinion, it is best to adopt Taqwa and abstain from eating%0D%0Ashrimps, etc. but they cannot be regarded as swine meat which is expressly%0D%0AHaraam.%0D%0A3. Yes, there are many Qurraa who have recited the Qur'aan in the seven%0D%0Adialects. From amongst them are, a) Shaykh Abdul-Samad Abdul-Baasit (CDs and%0D%0ACassettes), b) Shaykh Muhammad Siddique Minshawi (Cassettes), c) Shaykh%0D%0AMustapha Ismail (Cassettes), d) Shaykh Ali Abdur-Rahmaan Hudhayfi. Cassetes%0D%0Aare obtainable from Madrasah In'aamiyyah - Tape Library - Tel:%0D%0A0027-31-7851519%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
