  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like to know if it is proper for a muslim to participate in a Tertiary Graduation Ceremony. It these ceremonies, the graduate has to kneel ( go on his/her knees) before the Chancellor of the University. Is this allowed according to sharia?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, we wish to advise that these ceremonies are not free from Haraam, e.g. intermingling, etc. Kneeling down is done of one of two purposes, a) Showing respect, honour, etc. and b) Worship.\n\nIn view of the above, it is Haraam (prohibited) to kneel down for any one besides Allah for purposes of worship. Kneeling down to show respect is undesirable as it is similar to a form of worship.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
