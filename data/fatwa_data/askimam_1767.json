  "question": "Is this counted as Haiz or Istihazah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nA woman is aged 48. She has not had her periods for 8 years. During Ramadhan a bit of blood was spotted. After that no blood was spotted during the whole day. After 8 days the same thing happened. Is this counted as Haiz or Istihazah? And the days that she did not fast and not pray her namaz what will she have to do? Will she have to do Qaza or not? Jazakum Allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe spotting for only one day will be regarded as Istihaadha. During\nIstihaadha, a female is required to perform her salaah and fast. If she did\nnot do so, she must make qadha (make up) for the missed salaah and fasts.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
