  "question": "Can a woman take a picture of herself to show to a prospective bridegroom who lives overseas?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI do not take pictures of myself, since I know it is not lawful, except for government reasons, like passports. I wear full hijab including niqab and my family and I are strongly involved in the Tablighi Jamaat. There is a prospective bridegroom who wants to see how I look like. His family,who lives in U.S. would like me to show my picture to him. I have done istikhara and my parents and I have decided to proceed on with the marriage. This man tried to come to U.S.A but he was denied a visa. He wants to see my picture. Can I send it through his mother so that he may have one look at my picture? I will not allow them to let him keep my picture. I only want to do what is strictly Islamicly correct. Please respond in both Fathwa and Taqwa wise. Jazakallah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDue to the circumstances explained by you, we advise you to send a copy of\nyour passport photo to serve the purpose.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti E Desai\nFatwa Dept."
