  "question": "Can u interpret this dream for me? I'm divorced in absence of my husband(abusive husband) in court.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI saw in dream that there's a big gathering in our house. I was talking a guy who was suppose to take istekhaara for my second marriage, then saw my husband came w/his sister & wanted to get back together, showing so much love that he never did. I was keep refusing & showing so much of my anger. I was keep saying in dream that I don't wanna go. Then someone served an ice-cream to everyone & I was eating & kept my back at my husband. Someone also brought some sweets too & I heard my aunt saying to my husband that this sweet she likes most. After forcing too much then he said, I'm going right now & I'll be back again to take u. I didn't go & still was angry. That was the dream, can u plz tell me what does this indicate? I've 2 proposals that my parents r trying to get the istekhaara done.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe do not understand what is meant by \"I'm divorced in absence of my husband\n(abusive husband) in court\". Did your husband issue you an Islamic divorce?\nKindly elaborate. Also inform us more about your marriage, the time period,\nany children, does your 'ex'husband really want to reconcile with you. Your\nresponse to the above will enable us to interpret and advise accordingly.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
