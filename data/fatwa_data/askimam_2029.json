  "question": "As Sunni muslims do we believe that the Companions were sinless, because I have read nothing stating them making a sin.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe illustrious companions of our beloved Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) were not Ma'soom (free from the instinct of committing sin).\n\nThey were human beings and due to being constantly nurtured with\nspirituality by our beloved Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), they were\ngenerally Mahfooz (saved) from committing sins. However, they had the\ninstinct of committing sins and whenever they committed sins, they were\novercome by the fear of Allah Ta'ala and sincerely repented to the extent of\nsubmitting themselves to Hadd-Zinaa (capital punishment of being stoned to\ndeath due to committing adultery). That sincerity was motivated by the\nintense fear of Allah Ta'ala in them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
