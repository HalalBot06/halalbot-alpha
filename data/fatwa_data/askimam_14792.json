If in one house, there are 5 member, 2 parents and 3 children, can we give zakat to each one of them?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn principle, Zakaat is for the poor and needy Muslims. The definition of poor and needy in Shariah is, “that person who does not have excess wealth besides his basic needs equivalent to the minimum Nisab of Zakaat. Therefore, a, b, e, f, and? are eligible for Zakaat. In c if the student is an adult and he does not have excess wealth as explained, he too will be eligible to accept Zakaat. His family being rich does not disqualify him as a recipient of Zakaat.\n\n \n\nIn g, a rich widow will not be entitled to Zakaat. In I and j, only the poor brothers of the Jamaat will qualify for Zakaat. In k a poor person with a permanent house will be entitled for Zakaat. In m, a poor revert will be entitled for Zakaat. In n, if his debts exceed the value of all the things he has, he too will be entitled for Zakaat. However, morally he should sell some of his assets and pay his debts.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
