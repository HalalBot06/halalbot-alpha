  "question": "To have a child. Artificial insemination",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn order to get pregnant my doctors sugessted me to under go intra uterine inssemination in which semen of husband is taken and after some procedure is introduced in uters. Is it permissible or not.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION%0D%0A%0D%0AThe techniques of artificial insemination have been used in domestic animal%0D%0Abreeding as early as the fourteenth century among Arabs to inseminate%0D%0Ahorses. In the early 1890s researchers in Moscow developed A1 for sheep,%0D%0Acattle and horses, and the technique is now a major part of the sheep and%0D%0Acattle industry worldwide. At the end of the 18th century, an English%0D%0Aclinician, one John Hunter, claimed to have successfully applied the%0D%0Atechnique to humans. Successful experiments in France were followed by the%0D%0Areport of an American doctor in 1866 that he had performed fifty-five%0D%0Ainseminations on six women and had obtained the first A1 baby in this%0D%0Acountry.%0D%0A%0D%0AArtificial human insemination is the introduction of semen in the woman's%0D%0Avagina, cervical canal or uterus mechanically. It's purpose is to produce%0D%0Apregnancy when the wish to have a child apparently cannot be satisfied%0D%0Athrough normal sexual intercourse. This breakthrough in technology is%0D%0Aprobably well known to most people. The extended press coverage of Louise%0D%0ABrown, the first child born as a result of artificial reproduction on 25%0D%0AJuly 1978 created great interest in the field of human reproduction.%0D%0AArtificial reproduction is a term used to illustrate the various means of%0D%0Ahaving children. These include techniques ranging from the relatively simple%0D%0Aartificial insemination using semen of the husband (AIH), to artificial%0D%0Ainsemination using semen of an anonymous donor (AID) and sometimes the%0D%0Ahusband's semen is mixed with that of the donor (AIM), to the high tech of%0D%0AIVF which involves the fertilization of a sex cell followed by the transfer%0D%0Aor replacement of the resulting embryo into the woman, sometimes of a%0D%0Asurrogate mother.%0D%0A%0D%0ATypes of artificial insemination%0D%0AArtificial insemination using the husband's semen: This is not frequently%0D%0Aresorted to because the husband's semen is rarely of any value. However, it%0D%0Ais appropriate in the following situations, viz:%0D%0A- Where there are factors (such as physical difficulties) on the part of%0D%0Aeither the husband or a wife or both preventing successful intercourse, but%0D%0Awhere the fertility of both parties is otherwise adequate. Male physical%0D%0Adifficulties include premature ejaculation, physical impotence and obesity.%0D%0AFemale physical difficulties may include obesity, vaginal scarring or%0D%0Atumours, abnormal uterine position, vaginismus and cervical hostility.%0D%0A- Where the husband is subfertile because of defective spermatozoa, the%0D%0Achances of conception may be improved if the fertile part of the semen can%0D%0Abe separated from the less fertile part. Several specimens of a husband's%0D%0Asemen can be collected to form one single insemination. A1, therefore may be%0D%0Amore effective than natural intercourse.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe advantages of AIH, it is argued, is that a husband and wife can find a%0D%0Afamily through reproduction. Consequently, a husband will not feel left out%0D%0Aof the reproductive process. Furthermore, there is no difficulty or%0D%0Aambiguity with the resulting child's legal status, and the question of%0D%0Aparenthood is not raised. AIH is, thus, the least controversial of available%0D%0Aartificial techniques, morally, socially and legally.%0D%0A%0D%0ANevertheless, would these solutions to infertility be justified? Would it%0D%0Anot be tantamount to interfering with the systematic planning of Allah? It%0D%0Ais definitely true that such technology can be abused, but we cannot condemn%0D%0Ait as being totally against the Sunan of Allah since infertility can be%0D%0Aclassified as a \"disease\" or \"defect\". The saying of the Prophet \"for every%0D%0Adisease there is a cure\" gives Muslims the impetus to try and do something%0D%0Aabout it. However, inspite of corrective surgery, various other techniques%0D%0Acould create ethical problems, which would now be examined jurisdically.%0D%0A%0D%0A[ Islamic Principles on Family Planning; Mufti Allie Haroun Sheik pages%0D%0A133 - 134 ]%0D%0A%0D%0A"
