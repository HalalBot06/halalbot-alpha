  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy friend has been involved with a boy for the last couple of years. Their relationship began with internet chatting, but progressed to full boyfriend/girlfriend relationship. Her parents were furious when they found out that she went out with him, and they lost their trust in her. After they found out, she was never allowed to contact him, until now. She contacts him behind their back, and she is again falling into the same trap of decieving her parents. I tell her to let her parents marry the two, but she refuses because she claims that they'll never understand. What advice can i give her?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for submitting your question about your friend to the institute.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is indeed unfortunate that your friend is persisting in disobeying and%0D%0Adeceiving her parents. Not only is she incurring Allah Ta'ala's wrath for%0D%0Adisobeying His commandment of abstaining from intermigling with a ghair man,%0D%0Ashe is also incurring His wrath for openly defying her parents and for going%0D%0Anear%2Finto zinnah.%0D%0A%0D%0AEven though her father is against her present behaviour, she is causing him%0D%0Aharm as he is her guardian and thus accountable to Allah Ta'ala. As Muslims,%0D%0Aall boys and girls should realise that this type of disobedience towards%0D%0Aparents has grave consequences for all concerned.%0D%0A%0D%0AMuslim parents have an absolute right to stop their sons and daughters from%0D%0Adating. This is not a case of being 'old fashioned and backwards'. Dating%0D%0Ais a kuffar concept and also part of shaitaan's design to mislead us off the%0D%0Astraight path and into Jahannum. Muslim parents are obeying Allah Ta'ala's%0D%0Acommands and are also observing their children's rights over them. Every%0D%0Achild has the right to be protected from zinnah.%0D%0A%0D%0AShe is also destroying many of her rights as a Muslim woman. Who will be%0D%0Athere to help her in her time of need when she has turned away from her%0D%0Aparents and Allah Ta'ala?%0D%0A%0D%0AHer impulsive attitude puts her at risk of being taken advantage of. How%0D%0Asure is she that this fellow will respect, treasure and honour her when he%0D%0Aalready knows that she is capable of defying her parents? He could easily%0D%0Astring her along for as long as it suits him and take full advantage of her%0D%0Aby making her believe he will marry her. Yet he may decide to obey his%0D%0Aparent's wishes and marry someone more 'pure and modest'. He will believe%0D%0Athat it is his right to do so. He will already know that your friend is a%0D%0A'used item'. He could also be put off by the fact that if she could defy%0D%0Aher parents, she may even defy him as a husband and refuse to be a good%0D%0Amother to his children and a good Muslim wife according to Sharia.%0D%0ASo it means he may not trust her as he knows of her defiant attitude.%0D%0A%0D%0AI am sure you realise the dangers of chatting with strangers on the%0D%0Ainternet. There have been reported cases of young girls and even women being%0D%0Akidnapped and raped after meeting men via the chat rooms. It is commendable%0D%0Athat you are aware of the dangers your friend is in. Do try and convince her%0D%0Aand other friends to abstain from chatting with strangers in this way. This%0D%0Ais also a form of zinna as often the most coarse and disgusting language is%0D%0Aused by immodest men and women in these chat rooms.%0D%0A%0D%0AThere is so much to learn and so much knowledge one needs to gain as a%0D%0AMuslim woman. A whole lifetime of learning is needed to discover the vast%0D%0Atreasure of Islam and it's merits. Suggest to her that she should join you%0D%0Ain discovering the role, rights and position of women in Islam. Discover%0D%0Awhat a high pedestal Allah Ta'ala has placed women on. She will discover%0D%0Awhat a great contribution she can make to the lives of countless people and%0D%0Ahow she can earn her place in Jannah, just by obeying Allah Ta'ala. This%0D%0Alife on earth is but temporary. Your friend is a pricless diamond, created%0D%0Aand loved by Allah Ta'ala. She should save herself for a man who will also%0D%0Alove her as such. Allah Ta'ala will grant her honour when she performs nikah%0D%0Awith a man. The opposite of that is disgrace in dating a guy. Allah Ta'ala%0D%0Awill not turn away from her until she abandons HIM by her continued defiance%0D%0Aagainst her parents and Allah Ta'ala Himself.%0D%0A%0D%0AYour friend is an adult and has two choices. You can only try to show her%0D%0Aconcern and try to help her give up being a friend of shaitaan. Impress upon%0D%0Aher that Allah Ta'ala is most merciful, most forgiving and that He loves%0D%0Aher. Insha'allah, she will accept the help you offer her and choose to%0D%0Aremain Allah Ta'ala's beloved. May Allah Ta'ala guide you and all young%0D%0Apeople to maintain their honour and to seek companionship and love of the%0D%0Aopposite sex in nikah only. AMEEN.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best%0D%0A%0D%0A1Social department%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
