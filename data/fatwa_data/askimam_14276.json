If the official congregation (Jamaat) in a Musjid (Mosque) had taken place, a second Jamaat may be conducted out of the Musjid proper. For example, in the Sahn area. A Jamaat may also be formed in the office or elsewhere.\n\n2. Generally, in Ghusl, the limbs of Wudhu are also washed and one will also be regarded being in the state of Wudhu after Ghusl.\n\n3.
