  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am a new muslim.Alhamdulillah.My parents are still hindus.I pray for them to become muslim.But my husband is not allowing me to talk with them.what am i supposed to do?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah states in the Qur’aan, ‘Your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour.’ (Qur’aan 17:23)\n\nIt is clear from the above Aayat that one has to treat his/her parents with utmost love and care in word and action, and should not say or do anything that will hurt their feelings. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said regarding the father that he is the door between you and Jannah. A person has the choice to protect it or destroy it. (Tirmidhi)\n\nRegarding the mother, it has been reported that when a Sahaabi asked Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] who should I give my companionship, Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] replied 3 times,’Your mother.’\n\nTherefore, one should go all out in serving one’s parents. After all, they cared for one with love, compassion and mercy. When we couldn’t eat they fed us, when we couldn’t walk, they carried us. Now, when they are old we have to take care of them. Even if they are Kaafirs (disbelievers) except when they tell us to do any evil. Allah states in the Qur’aan, ‘If they (your parents) strive to join you in worship with me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not.’ (Surah31 Aayat15)\n\nWhen a person gets married then added to the kindness and the rights do parents one has to fulfil the rights of the spouse. As much as you want to be kind to your parents, your husband does not even allow you to speak to them. Therefore, you should speak to your husband on a day when he is in a good mood and happy, and explain to him how you feel about abandoning your parents because of him. Ask him to allow you time to speak and visit your parents so that they could also one day accept Islam. If you be of service to him and ask him in a good wah, he will allow you to communicate with your parents, Insha Allah. You also should make du’aa and seek Allah’s help and assistance.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
