  "answer": "QUESTION\nIS THE USAGE OF PERFUMES CONTAINING ALCHOL LAWFULL/PROHIBETED? PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY. FUTHER MORE IF ONE WAS TO SAY THAT IT IS UNLAWFULL BECAUSE ALCHOL IS HARAAM, AND IF ONE WAS TO SAY THAT THE ALCHOL USED IN PERFUMES THE SAME ALCHOL WAS TO BE USED IN FOOD/DRINK, THEN IF THE ALCHOL IS INTOXICANT(MUSKIR) TEN THE USEAGE OF THAT PERFUME WOULD BE HARAAM OTHERWISE HALLAL. THEN WHY IS ALCHOL USED IN PERFUMES ANYWAY. PLEASE INFORM ME. MAY ALLAH TA`ALA HELP U ANSWERING THIS QUESTION TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE. INSHAALLAH MAY ALLAH TA`ALA REWARED U INSHAALLAH. YOUR CONFUSED BROTHER HASSAN JAMIL. JAZA KUMU ALLAH KHAIR.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible to use deodorants that contain alcohol from grapes or\ndate extracts. Such perfumes are impure and Salaat with it is invalid.\nHowever, if the alcohol is synthetic, it is pure and permissible to use.\nSalaat without washing off such perfumes will be valid. Sometimes, it\nbecomes difficult to differentiate between genuine and synthetic alcohol.\nThus, to be on the safe side, one should rather prefer using deodorants and\nperfumes that are labelled as 'alcohol-free', especially when such perfumes\nare easily available.
