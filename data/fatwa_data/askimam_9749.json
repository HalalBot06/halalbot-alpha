  "answer": "QUESTION\n1.) Some people are claiming that the incident of magic being performed on the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) is not true. It is claimed that such a belief entails a negation of him being protected by Allah (swt) and thus free from error in matters of the deen. Doubt has also been cast on the authenticity of the narration(s) on this matter (even the ones in Sahih Bukhari). Please shed some light on this matter as well the authenticity of the narrations involved. 2.) What is your opinion of the Urdu book \"Mazhabi daastaane aur un ki haqeeqat\" by Habibur Rahman Siddiqui? There are some controversial positions in this book.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We cannot understand how such 'a belief entails a negation of him being protected by Allah' more especially after considering the numerous other difficulties and hardships that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was put through. The books of history are replete and bear ample testimony to this fact. One may open any authentic book on the history of the lifestyle of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and he will be able to witness this. The narrations of Bukhari are clear regarding magic being performed on Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). (pgs.852, 857 - Chapter on Magic - vol.2). It has been unanimously agreed that all the narrations of Bukhari are authentic. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) being protected by Allah refers to those issues which involve and relate to the matters and propagation of Deen.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. We regret that we do not have a copy of such a book and have not come across one, hence, we are unable to comment.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
