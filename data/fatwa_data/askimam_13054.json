  "question": "Do we have to perform ghusl before fajr if we are not paak (clean) during the month of Ramadhan.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI want to know that if a person masturbates or has sexual intercourse at night during the month of Ramadhan, do they have to perform ghusl before fajr time or are they allowed to wait until after they wake up after fajr and then do it.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFirstly, masturbation is Haraam.\n\nSecondly, the Ghusl has to be made to ensure that the Fajr is performed in its correct time. One will be sinful if the Ghusl is delayed to the extent that Salaat becomes Qadhaa.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
