They came to Nabi (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallalm) and submitted to him, “The religion you invite us to, is no doubt very good, but we have a problem. We are continuously reminded about all those sins we have already committed.  If we become Muslims, is there hope that our repentance will be accepted. Thereupon Allah Ta’ala revealed the following verse:-\n\nSay (on My behalf), ―O servants of Mine who have acted recklessly against their own selves, do not despair of Allah‘s mercy. Surely, Allah will forgive all sins. Surely, He is the One who is the Most-Forgiving, the Very-Merciful. [39:53]\n\nThe outcome of this verse comes to be that, well before death arrives, the repentance made from sins, no matter how serious, even from kufr-(disbelief) and shirk-(ascribing of partners) to Allah Ta’ala is readily accepted.\n\n(Ma’ariful Qur’an, Pg. 574)\n\nIn another verse Allah Ta’ala makes mention of a simple solution, yet dynamic in its outcome i.e.\n\nإِنَّ الْحَسَنَاتِ يُذْهِبْنَ السَّيِّئَاتِ ذَلِكَ ذِكْرَى لِلذَّاكِرِينَ\n\n Surely, good deeds erase bad deeds. That is a reminder for the mindful. [11:114]\n\n \n\n \n\nAnother aspect to consider about forgiveness is that doing good deeds such as giving your time and money to charity, is a way for Allah Ta’ala to automatically blot out your minor sins without you even asking for forgiveness from such sins.\n\n\n\n\nHazrat Abu Bakr (Radiyallahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said: “if a Muslim regrettably falls into some sin, he should make wudhu and offer two raka’ats of nafl salaah, then that sin will be forgiven. This is known as salaatul taubah. (Prayer of repentance)\n\n (Musnad Ahmad & Ibn Kathir)\n\n \n\nThe act of fornication is a major sin. In order for major sins to be expiated and forgiven, sincere repentance is a condition. Firstly, you need to recognize that what you have done is wrong. Secondly, you need to be remorseful of the action. Thirdly, you need to acquire a firm determination that you will sincerely try hard never to do the act again, and finally, you need to beseech Allah Ta’ala for forgiveness.\n\n \n\nThe religion of Islam is complete, comprehensive, unique and indeed beautiful. If one errs then hope is just around the corner. We should not lose hope so easily, however, this does not mean that we go around enjoying and indulging in haraam and when we feel like, make taubah and continue as though nothing has happened. This is all a test from Allah Ta’ala and to be successful in these tests, we need to bring our lives onto the straight path\n\n \n\nNeverthelesss, you have consulted a medical practitioner and sought advice concerning your sexually transmitted disease. We concur with his advice from a medical point of view as well as from the side of Shariah. Alhamdulillah, you mentioned how ashamed and shameful you feel and at the same time you are seeking medical help. Continue in this manner and do not expose your past as this is the duty of Allah Ta’ala and not ours as human beings.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl.
