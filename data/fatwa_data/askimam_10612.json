  "question": "I keep forgetting no. of Sajdahs in each rakat & also wasting water in doing Wudhu.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. I have this big problem of forgetting how many Sajdahs I performed in each Rakat. I try my best 2 concentrate but I often forget. Most of the time I think it's correct but I begin 2 just doubt. Can I Keep my forefinger & middle finger apart in 2nd sajdah to remember number of sajdahs so I will be able 2 remember? Is it permissible? If not give some advice. 2. I have a lot of trouble doing wudhu as I take a lot of time & waste water as my parents say. I have heard that even if 1 mm of the face or other particular parts is not washed, wudhu would be invalid? Is this true? That is why I keep washing my face (& other parts) slowly & many times even though I know washing more than 3 times is not preferable. I feel that is a small sin compared to my wudhu going invalid & my prayers not accepted? Or shud I just wash my face quickly till I FEEL most of it's wet & hope Allah accepts my wudhu? Or shud I keep washing it slowly like before even though its waste of time & water? 3. Is the No.19 Theory in Quran true? I know Rashaad Khlalifa is not a true Muslim but I just want 2 know what other scholars say about this theory which I feel is one of the miracles of the Quran (if it is true)? 4. I read a detailed version of Prophet?s Meraaj journey which describes all the seven heavens on this link http://www20.brinkster.com/gurupak/Miraaj%20-%20The%20Ascension%20to%20Heaven.htm Is it correct or fabricated? Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If the only way to concentrate on your Sajdas is through the indication of your fingers, then you may adopt that.\n\n2. In Wudhu, the entire face from the forehead till the chin, from one earlobe till the other, must be washed. No portion of the face must be left unwashed. That can be achieved through Zann-e-Ghaalib (being almost certain). If one washes the entire face three times, then Zann-e-Ghaalib is already achieved. The Wudhu is certainly valid upon washing three times.\n\n3. The theory no.19 has no basis in Shari?ah.\n\n4. We have not seen the link in reference as yet.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
