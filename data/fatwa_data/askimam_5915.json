  "question": "Can u tell me the meaning of this verse of the Quran? “let there arise amounst you a Jamaat, which enjoys the good and forbids the evil”",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn the Quran it say?s ?let there arise amounst you a Jamaat, which enjoys the good and forbids the evil? what is the mening of this verse, and what is this Jamaat?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala says, 'Let there arise amongst you a group' which indicates%0D%0Athat the existence of this group is obligatory. It will be necessary for the%0D%0AMuslims to form such a group if it has yet not been formed.%0D%0A%0D%0AThereafter, Allah Ta'ala explains the work of this group by saying, 'enjoins%0D%0Agood and forbids evil.' i.e. the object, task and responsibility of this%0D%0Agroup should be to invite towards good at every given moment and time. This%0D%0Awill be their job continuously. In fact, prior to the mentioning of 'enjoins%0D%0Agood and forbids evil', Allah Ta'ala said, 'they invite towards good'.%0D%0AInvitation towards good is general and continuous whilst to command towards%0D%0Agood and forbig evil are restricted to circumstances.%0D%0A%0D%0AAny person who has these qualities will fall under the abovementioned group.%0D%0AThere is no specification as to who exactly is this group, however, all%0D%0Athose who invite towards good, in whatever way can be included in this%0D%0Averse.
