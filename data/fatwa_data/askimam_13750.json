  "question": "does Islam allow one to offer food and drinks to Muslim visitors/relatives who visits our place of residence but does not fast",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIn the month of Ramadhan (during the period of fasting), does Islam allow one to offer food and drinks to Muslim visitors/relatives who visits our place of residence but does not fast for no obvious reason.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf there is no reason for the visitors not to fast, for example, they are not ill or they are not travelers, and they were required to fast, then it is not permissible to offer them food or drinks during fasting time as that will be assisting in sin.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
