  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it true that you get a premonition of your death 40 days before you pass away? I have heard this from several people but have not found any hadeeth or Qur'aanic verses to substantiate it.\n\nAlso, the following website talks about women and the cutting of their hair.  It states that they are allowed to cut their hair, and it quotes hadeeth to prove this.  The website URL is http://63.175.194.25/index.php?QR=13744&ln=eng    Please kindly comment on its authenticity, because I have been told that women were not allowed to cut their hair.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The above is possible but not absolute.\n\n2. The view of allowing women to cut their hair is erroneous leading reliable scholars of every Madhab disapproved of it.
