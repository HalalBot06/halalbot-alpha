It is a sin not to perform these Sunnats. %0D%0A%0D%0ASunnat-e-Ghayr Muakkadah (not emphasized), for example, the four Rakaats before Esha Salaat. If one does not perform these Salaats, he will not be sinful. Nafl means extra or voluntary. It refers to every Salaat which is not necessary to perform but meritorious, for example, Tahajjud Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0ASunnat-e-Muakkadah Salaat is an emphasised Sunnat which Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) performed punctually without leaving it out. The Fuqahaa have stated that a person will be sinful for not performing his Sunnat-e-Muakkadah Salaats (Shaami vol.1 pg.498; Kuwait).%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Umm Habiba (Radhiyallaahu Anha) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Whosoever performs twelve Rakaats of Salaat during the day and night, an abode in Jannah will be prepared for him; four Rakaats before Dhuhr, two Rakaats after Dhuhr, two Rakaats after Maghrib, two Rakaats after Esha and two Rakaats before Fajr Salaat (Mishkat vol.1 pg.103; Kuwait).%0D%0A%0D%0ABesides the above Hadith explaining the general virtue of performing the twelve Rakaats of Sunnat-e-Muakkadah Salaat, there are other Ahaadith explaining the virtues of some specific Sunnat-e-Muakkadah Salaats.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Ayyoub Ansari (Radhiyallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Four Rakaats before Dhuhr with only one Salaam (i.e. with Salaam only after the fourth rakaat, not after two Rakaats also) is a means of opening the doors (of mercy) of the sky (Mishkat pg.104; Kuwait).%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Umme Habiba (Radhiyallaahu Anha) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Whosoever is punctual in performing the four Rakaats Salaat before Dhuhr, Allah will make the fire of Hell Haraam upon him.' (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Huzayfah (Radhiyallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Hasten with performing two Rakaats after Maghrib for they are lifted up with the Fardh Salaat.' (Mishkat pg.105; Kuwait)%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Whosoever leaves out the four Rakaat Sunnats before Dhuhr, will not get my intercession on the day of Qiyaamat.' (Shaami vol.1 pg.494; Kuwait)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt should be noted that on Friday, after the Jummu'ah Salaat for males, it is also Sunnat-e-Muakkadah to perform 4 Rakaats with one Salaam (only after four Rakaats, not after two Rakaats also). (Shaami vol.1 pg.497; Kuwait)%0D%0A%0D%0AApart from the Sunnat-e-Muakkadah Salaats, occasionally Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) performed voluntary Nafil Salaats before Asr and Esha, and mentioned great virtues for those Salaats as well. %0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Hurayra (Radhiyallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Whosoever among you performs Salaat after Jummu'ah should perform four Rakaats.' (Mishkat pg.104; Kuwait)%0D%0A%0D%0AIbn Umar (Radhiyallaahu Anhuma) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'May Allah have mercy upon that person who performs four Rakaats before Asr Salaat.' (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe most emphasised Sunnat-e-Muakkadah Salaats is the two Rakaats before the Fardh of Fajr Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Aaisha (Radhiyallaahu Anha) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to be extremely steadfast on the two Sunnat Rakaats of Fajr Salaat. (Mishkat pg.104; Kuwait)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Aaisha (Radhiyallaahu Anha) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'The two Rakaats of Fajr Salaat are better than the entire world and its contents.' (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is mentioned in Sharhul Inaaya that if one reaches the Masjid and the congregational Fajr Salaat has already commenced and the person has not yet performed the two Sunnats of Fajr, then if he expects that he can perform the Sunnats of Fajr and join the Imaam (at least) in the last Qaaida (sitting), he should perform the two Rakaats of Sunnat (and then join the Imaam).' (Fathul Qadeer vol.1 pg.414; Maktaba Rashidiyya). However, the Sunnats should not be performed in the Masjid proper. %0D%0A%0D%0AIt is reported in Bayhaqi from Hadhrat Abu Hurayra (Radhiyallaahu Anhu) that the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'When the Fardh Salaat begins then no other prayer should be performed besides the Fardh Salaat, except the two Sunnats of Fajr (they can be performed when the Fardh Salaat is being performed).'
