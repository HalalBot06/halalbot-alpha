  "question": "After becoming murted for bad words or jokes about the Prophet (s.a.s.) can one be forgiven by Allah (c.c.)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs you know the 4 mezahib Imams say that such a man will be killed even if he makes tavba. Does it mean that the islamic jursidiction doesn't accept his tavba as a reason to let him free in order to prevent fitna or does it really mean that this man will be in cehennem even forever even if he really regrets what he did. For example in a non-islamic state: should a Muslim that made such a mistake and directly regreted it and made tavba see himself as Muslim or Kafir?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to all four Madhabs, this person?s Tawbah will be accepted. In this case, he will not be killed. (Refer Rasaail ibn Aabideen vol.1 pg.314)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
