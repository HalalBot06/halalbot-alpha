  "question": "Are there any exceptions as to if you lie to someone, they have to forgive you? What kinds of lies constitute him having to forgive you?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI mean, if the person doesn't know that you lied, and it didnt really hurt him to be lied to because it was trivial topic that was lied about, does one need to be forgiven by the person? Are there ANY exceptions to lying and having to be forgiven by someone?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nTo speak lies is prohibited and invokes the anger of Allah Ta'ala. It is\nnecessary that the liar makes sincere Tawbah (repentance) from speaking\nlies, whether the person in reference heard the lie or not.\n\nOnly if he heard the lies spoken about him must the liar seek his\nforgiveness.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
