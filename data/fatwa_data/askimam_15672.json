  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI wish to know is it alright to read from the Quran while holding it in hands and lead the Taraweh salah?\n\nWhat should the people do about such imam if this method is wrong?\n\nWhat is the ruling about the people who stand behind the imam and hold the Quran in their hands, like in the Haramin and Sharifain? Is it allowed?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, holding the Quran and reciting from it is not allowed and such a salah would not be correct.\n\nIf the Imam is a Hanafi, he should be advised to refrain from this practice.\n\nIf he follows another madhab, then he would be allowed to do so, as other madhahib do grant permission for this.\n\nAs a Hanafi, one should perform salah in a Masjid behind an Imam who does not perform salah in such a manner.\n\nAs for the followers, the same applies to them. If their madhahib allow it, then they may do so.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Husain Kadodia\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
