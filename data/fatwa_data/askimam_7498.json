  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat if the main speaker is not in a position to practise or implement what she preaches ,should she discontinue the ishtima?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe knowledge of the religion of Islam makes up our Deen. It is important to examine where we get our Deen from. The person must have the following qualities: 1. The Aqaaid (beliefs) must be correct. They must be in conformity to the beliefs of the Ahlus sunnah.\n\n2. The person got formal education from a reliable institute or a reliable Aalim and his/her knowledge is sound. That may be ascertained by reliable Ulama.\n\n3. The person must strictly adhere to the Qur?aan and Sunnah in his personal life.\n\nIf a person, male or female, has the abovementioned qualities, then only such a person may educate others. If a female is not found, then a male may address a female gathering on conditions the laws of Hijaab are strictly adhered to.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
