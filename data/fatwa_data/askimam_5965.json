  "question": "When we request people to make Duâ€™aa for us, or for a particular issue we are facing, are we committing shirk in any way by (a) telling others about our difficulties, (b) using the help of others?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDoes sharing with anybody our hardship or a particular problem in life we are facing, fall under ?complaining against the will of Allah s.w.t.? (which I believe is a major sin)? Even if this sharing is purely with the intention of request for Du?aas?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not shirk to share one's problem or request help from a wellwisher.\nThere were many instances where the Sahabah (Radhiallaahu Anhum) requested\nduas and help from Nabi (s.a.w), which he extended to them without\ndisapproval.\n\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said; \"Actions are judged by their\nintentions\" (Bukhari). Sharing a difficulty with others does not constitute\ncomplaining against the will of Allah, if one did not intend to do so.\nRather, one may even be rewarded if he did so with the intention of Mushwara\n(seeking council).\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
