  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Sahab, What is the Sharia'h ruling on keeping beard immediate below the lower lip. Can we trim it if its hair turns into mouth. Was Salaam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe beard immediately below the lower lip is known as the Anfaka which has\nthe same rule (command) as that of the beard. The Anfaka that hair which is\nbelow the lower lip (Nihaaya ibn Atheer)\n\nTo remove the hair of Anfaka is prohibited just as the removing the hair of\nthe beard. (Munhal). It is narrated in the Ahaadith that a few strands of\nhair of the lower lip 'Anfaka' of our beloved Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) were white. (Nihaaya Ibn Atheer vol.3 pg.151)\n\nIt is clear that the beloved Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to\nkeep this part of the beard. (Beard - Sunnat of the Ambiyaa). As for\nyourself, the turning of this part of the beard into the mouth, try to apply\noil, etc. which will assist you in straightening the hair and not causing\nyou any inconvenience.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
