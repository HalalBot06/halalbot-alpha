  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI work in a Multi National Company in Saudi Arabia. Our company sell the products with cartoon pack through dealers and also for projects directly to the end user. We have a target for sales and upon achieving the company reward us an Incentive of 5%. The accountant who calculates and issues the incentive is having jealous with me seriously & therefore he cuts my incentive all the time & my other colleagues get there rights exactly. If I complaint to the owner (Shaikh) of our company then he will again ask for the related documents to the accountant only since he believes the acccountant to be Ameen for his company. And further more if we knows that I complaint to the shaikh he can harm me more. Therefore I have another solution to get my right. When I sell the company products to the customer we make agreement with a subcontractor to install it. I got an Idea that why not I make contract amount a little higher to cover my Incentives and take that amount from the subcontractor to my company. So, I wanted to know that whether coveringÂ  my incentives from this method is Halaal or Haraam? can you suggest me if you have any Idea to recover my incentives?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe acknowledge receipt of your mail.\n\nWe are currently considering some issues mentioned in your mail.
