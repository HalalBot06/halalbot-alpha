  "answer": "QUESTION\nhow can I make myself steadfast on this deen and is there any du'a for this?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou should understand very well that thoughts, even if they be of Kufr,%0D%0AZina, etc. have no impact on your Imaan whatsoever. In fact, these thoughts%0D%0Aare signs of your Imaan. The pious and noble companions of Nabi (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) also complained to him of evil thoughts to which he replied%0D%0Aby saying, 'That is a clear sign of Imaan.'%0D%0A%0D%0ATodate, we have never heard anyone involved in sins, and leading a life%0D%0Atotally against the Shari'ah complaining of evil thoughts. If we get%0D%0Acomplains then it is in most cases from those who have made a firm intention%0D%0Ato change their lives and become better Muslims. Your mind is like a%0D%0Ahighway. Today a king or pious person would pass over it, tomorrow a begger%0D%0Aor evil person would pass by. In the same way, one day you would get good%0D%0Athoughts (of performing Salaat, reciting the noble Qur'aan, etc.) and on%0D%0Aanother day you would get evil thoughts of Kufr, Zina, etc. As long as the%0D%0Athoughts are not put into action, you would not be answerable for them,%0D%0Ahence, you need not worry about them.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs for the cure, understand that these thoughts are like live electric%0D%0Awires. If you pay attention to them by touching them, you will get shocked.%0D%0ASo ignore them. Secondly, it is a fact that one can not pay full attention%0D%0Ato two things at the same time. Therefore, when these thoughts come, ignore%0D%0Athem and occupy yourself in some other work. You may also read 'Laa hawla%0D%0AWalaa Quwwata Illaa billaahi al-Aliyy al-Adheem' (There is no power - to%0D%0Arefrain from evil - nor ability - to doing good - except with Allah, the%0D%0AMost High, the Exalted) and say the following words, 'Aamantu billaahi wa%0D%0Arusulihi' (I bring Imaan - firm conviction - in Allah and His Messenger%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). These are quite effective in repelling evil%0D%0Athoughts.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
