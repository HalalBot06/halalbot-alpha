  "question": "\"King of Madina\"",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am reading a Fatwa from the following link:\nhttp://www.islam.tc/ask-imam/view.php?q=12392\n\nBy reading this, I reminded the following discussion of couple of people while travelling through public transport: \"There is a person who is good in practicing Islam but very careless. He used to call his friend with a nickname whose meaning is not good. He often had an idea of calling his friend like \"king of nickname\" but he didn't as he know that there is a word \"King of Madina\". He stopped himself uttering that word. Once, he uttered that word totally unintentionally when saw his friend. Then word, \"King of Madina\", came to his mind and he is repenting. He just called his friend and there is no other intention. He think that it might be contempt of Prophet (Naooz Billah)(Allah forgive us). He prayed to Allah for forgiveness with tears in his eyes on this un-intentional incident and slip of tongue.\"\n\nNow questions are:\n1. In the above case, is this a contemptous action (action is unintentional and mere slip of tongue) as there is no intention towards Prophet PBUH (Naooz Billah).\n2. Is tawbah be accepted and that person will remain Muslim? and If no, then how that person will enter in Islam again?\n\nMay Allah forgive all of us and May Allah fill our hearts with the love for Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), Ameen.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe thought “King of Madina” in reference to his friend does not constitute disrespect to Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم). However it is not permissible to call others with nicknames having bad meanings. Ones should make tawba and Istighfar from that.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
