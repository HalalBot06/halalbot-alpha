  "question": "Is it allowed to go to a house warming party?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Is it permissible to have a house warming party (a party when someone buys a new house)? 2. Are we allowed going to a house warming party, or to any party if the house is on interest?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is permissible in Shari'ah, in fact, encouraged to express Allah Ta'\nala's favours (Tahdees bin Ni'mah) upon oneself. The possession of a house\nis indeed a great favour of Allah Ta'ala and one may invite people and feed\nthem on this joyous occasions. However, there should be nothing un-Islamic\nin such an occasion.\n2. To purchase a house on interest is prohibited. To attend a house warming\nparty in such a situation will be showing complacence to the sin of\ninterest.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
