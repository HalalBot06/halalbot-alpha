  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would just like to know whether there are any contradictions of the study of psychology with Islam. As I don't really believe in the study of psychology due to the fact that Islam has a solution for eveyting (including phyc. problems) not psychologist. My wife is studying psychology and we are getting married soon. Alhumdulliah from the bounties of Allah my family is well off. My wife wishes to complete here Honours in psyc. but I dont wish that as it will give her the extra urge and drive to go for a job, Which I will not allow!. how can I convince her islamically that completing honours will be a waist of time as she will never get to use it.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nJazakallah for writing to the institute.\n\nLet me suggest at the outset that you sit down and discuss matters with the lady you are planning to marry. It is very important that both of you are on the same page regarding what you both will allow and not allow, accept and not accept  before you get married. There is not point in having problems regarding these matters after marriage. Seeing that you have  already set a date for the marriage, I am surprised that you raise this issue now only. If she is studying via correspondence (distant learning) there should be no problem.\n\n \n\nIslam does have answers to many problems but we are faced with many trials and tribulations in the world at the moment. It could be that her skills can be used to assist fellow sisters and children by counselling them. It will be important for her to use  an Islamic ethos alongside her knowledge as a psychologist. However, this is for you two to make mashura and negotiate.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\nSocial Dept.\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
