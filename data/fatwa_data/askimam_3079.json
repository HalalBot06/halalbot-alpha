  "question": "Is it wajib to make up prayers if I did Makruh Tahrimun acts during them?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have been told that in the Hanafi madhab it is Wajib to make up prayers if a makruh tahrimun act was performed during it. Is this true? Also, how does the lay man distinguish between makruh tahrimun acts and makruh tanzilun acts, when books of Fiqh do not distinguish between them?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, when one unintentionally omits a Waajib act\nand did not compensate it with Sajda-e-Sahw, the Salaat is\nMakrooh-e-Tahrimi. It is Waajib to repeat such a Salaat within the Fardh\nSalaat time.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
