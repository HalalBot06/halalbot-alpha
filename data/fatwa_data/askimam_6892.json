  "question": "What must one pray in order for Allah taala to accept their dua quickly?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs there something one should do in order for Allah to accept their dua really quickly. Is there a specific time or particular saying one must say for this to occur. Also can you please provide me with a dua which I can pray which will help me improve my memory and concentration as well as with my stuides. May Allah reward you for you help. Ameen\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou should never become despondent. Allah Ta?ala always answers a person?s Du?aas but in different forms. Sometimes, he grants the person his need immediately, sometimes, Allah Ta?ala stores away the reward for the hereafter and at times Allah Ta?ala removes a calamity that was about to befall him.\n\nTherefore, your Du?aas are always accepted. Nevertheless, times of acceptance are particularly just before Maghrib Salaat, at the time of Tahajjud and also between Fajr and sunrise.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
