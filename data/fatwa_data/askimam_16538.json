  "question": "Cutting hair",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSalaam,\n\nEver since I have found out that women aren't allowed to cut their hair I have stopped. I haven't cut my hair for 2 years now. The only problem is that when I had it cut 2 years ago I had it layered ( cut in different lengths), and now it looks a big mess because of the various lengths...the longest layer is below my waist and the shortest layer is above.Â My intention is just to get it straightened all the same length so can I cut it just this last time?\n\nPlease let me know.\n\nWasalaam\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIf you do cut your hair to straighten it, you should make tawba and Istighfaar for that.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa, Madrassah In'aamiyyah"
