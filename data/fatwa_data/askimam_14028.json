  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMost or all emails,letters, faxes and general correspondences we receive from fellow Muslims begin with the salaam. How do we respond to this? Do we necessarily have to respond to it?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah Taa’la states \"And when you are greeted, then reply in a better way or at least in the same manner\". Therefore, if anyone has written Salaam, you should reply to their Salaam.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
