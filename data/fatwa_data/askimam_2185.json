  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaam Imam Sahib. I had a dream after a week of performing Ishtikhara prayers. In my dream the person who has proposed to me is seen walking away from me. Am I to take this as Allah (swt) will and say no to the brother who has proposed. Your in put in this matter is greatly appreciated. Jazakallah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is narrated in Sahih Bukhari from Hadhrat Jaabir (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'When you have a doubt%0D%0Aregarding a certain matter (i.e. to accept a proposal or not, etc.) then%0D%0Aperform two Rakaats of Nafl Salaat and recite the following Du'aa .'%0D%0A%0D%0AWe understand from this Hadith that the purpose of Istikhaara is to%0D%0Aeliminate the doubt which one has regarding some matter. Therefore,%0D%0AIstikhaara should be made with a clear mind, and without being inclined to%0D%0Aany side in that matter. Since the purpose of Istikhaara is only to%0D%0Aeliminate the doubt and uncertainty which one has, it is not even necessary%0D%0Afor one to see a dream. If upon awakening, one finds his%2Fher heart inclined%0D%0Ato one side of the matter for which he%2Fshe made Istikhaara, then one should%0D%0Aact in accordance to the inclination of his%2Fher heart. However, if one is%0D%0Astill uncertain then one should continue making Istikhaara for 7 days. Insha%0D%0AAllah, the uncertainty which one has would be removed within this period,%0D%0Aand one would (in most cases after receiving some indication in a dream)%0D%0Afind his heart inclined to a certain side in that matter. If one is still%0D%0Auncertain after 7 days, which is possible, then one should resort to%0D%0AIstishaarah (seeking advice from a learned person, etc.)%0D%0A%0D%0AAs for your dream, the indication in it is quite clear. It shows that the%0D%0Amarriage will most probably not work out. One of the most essential%0D%0Aingredients to a happy and successful marriage is compatibility between the%0D%0Aspouses. It is very possible that two persons be pious but not compatible to%0D%0Aone another. Therefore, one should not entertain evil thoughts of the one%0D%0Awho has proposed. The dream in no way indicates that he is a bad person.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
