  "question": "Is it true that women who go to heaven will have one husband whom they will have to share amongst 70 other women as men will have 70 wives.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThis is certanily not fair nor is it justice. I'm sure Allah loves us all and women will be treated equally amongst men, because we also are humans like them and do the same deeds as them, so why will women have to share their husband. I'm not saying women should have more than one husband but sharing with 70 others is certainly outrageous, if a man was to share one wife amongst 70 other men, he woud think the same.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt appears that your concern devolves around women's feelings. Obviously,\nour hearts and its feelings are in the control of Allah and He has promised\nevery dweller of Jannah peace and contentment.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
