  "question": "Can you attend/be involved in organizing Islamic talks/circles where there isnâ€™t FULL segregation as Women are allowed to see the male speaker?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am involved in dawah efforts at the university that I am studying at, Alhumdullilah they have regularly Islamic talks&circles. But unfortunately they donot adhere the audience to strict purdah. The room is split into three sections, one where the men reside, the next where the women reside and finally a section for women where they will be able to see the (male) speaker. Thus in the first & second sections, men and women are FULLY segregated. But in the third section the women cannot see the men in the audience but can nevertheless see the (male) speaker. Although I personally am against this, some of the reasoning given to me is female?s (sisters) find it hard to concentrate on what the speaker is saying without having some sort of visual appearance of the speaker. These talks are also open too non-muslims, who will be more encouraged to attend if they are not alienated behind a hijaab. What I want to know is: 1) Is what is happening permissible, or should there be strict purdah regardless of how people feel? Or due to non-muslims attending? 2) If the current segregation structure (mentioned above) is IMPERMISSIBLE, but others do not agree with this stance, should I stop working in any form of dawah effort alongside them? 3) Is it permissible for me to even attend such talks, although I would be seated in the fully segregated section? Please have the answer verified by Hadhrat Taqi Usmani himself.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible to attend mixed gatherings.\n\nMufti Muhammad Taqi Uthmaani states in his book, ?Qadhaaya?, (pg.344), it is not permissible to attend such circles and there is no necessity in attending because he will be putting himself in such a place where there is Fisq and destruction to his Deen. Furthermore, he said it?s advisable that he must consider his Deen even if other Muslim they agree upon that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
