  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaikum Mufti Sahab, 1. A muslim has to do good deeds only for the sake of Allah s.w.t but sometimes when I think of great people like Maulana Gangohi and Maulana Thanvi I have the urge to do good deeds which is at that moment not for the sake of Allah s.w.t. but because I want to imitate the great people to some extent, however small it may be. Is this correct? I have read on your site a lot of brothers suffering from the bad habit of masturbation. I have read in fazail aamal that the rectation of the kalimah is the best thing for cleaning the heart. Why not recommend it to people who suffer from masturbation, looking at porn, nude/semi-nude pictures, evil thoughts etc.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Your love for great Ulama like Moulana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi (RA) and Moulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi (RA) is due to your love for Allah. Imitating such scholars and following their advices is also due to your love for Allah.\n\n2. Jazaakumullah for your suggestion. The recitation of Laa ilaaha illallaahu is indeed the greatest Dhikr and has a great impact on reforming oneself. It is also advisable to understand the meaning and implication of Laa ilaaha illallaahu (There is no Lord but Allah) and recite the Kalimah with that spirit.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
