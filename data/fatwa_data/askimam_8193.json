  "answer": "QUESTION\nI need to know what are the rulings regarding the donation of blood and bone marrow ,we have the blood foundation coming to my workplace ,am I allowed to donate...\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ: Can Muslims donate%2Ftransfuse blood?%0D%0A%0D%0AA: It is permissible to donate and transfuse blood if:%0D%0A%0D%0Aa) There is a desperate need to donate blood; %0D%0Ab) There is no other alternative; and %0D%0Ac) This has been prescribed by an expert medical practitioner. %0D%0A%0D%0AThis permissibility is based on the principal of ?necessity relaxes prohibition?. (Al-Ashbaah). %0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, the permissibility of blood donation and blood transfusion is determined by the following conditions:%0D%0Aa) The donor willingly donates his blood. If he is compelled to do so, it will not be permissible; %0D%0Ab) There is no danger to his (the donor?s) life or health; %0D%0Ac) If the doctor feels that the patient will lose his life and there is no other alternative but recourse of blood transfusion; and %0D%0Ad) There is no fear of death but the recovery is not possible without blood transfusion. It is not permissible to sell one?s blood or to pay the blood donor. However, if one is in need of blood desperately and the only means to obtain the blood is to purchase it, then only will it be permissible to pay for the blood. %0D%0A%0D%0ANB. Blood donation and blood transfusion is not permissible for the sake of beautification or for any other reason other than genuine necessity.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
