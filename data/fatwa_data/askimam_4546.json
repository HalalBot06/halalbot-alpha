  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen financial circumstances become constraint, we are required to decrease\nour spending and live within our means. We are not allowed to get involved\nin Haraam merely because the cost of living is rising, and we cannot keep up\nwith it.\n\nNo matter what you are earning, consider that many survive on much less than\nthat. You too can do so. All it requires to sacrifice the many luxuries we\ngenerally have in our lives. The attitude of a Muslim should be, 'I rather\ndie than get involved in Haraam.'\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
