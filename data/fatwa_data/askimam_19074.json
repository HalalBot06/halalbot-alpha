  "question": "What punishment will a man get if he divorced his wife without any reason?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat punishment will a man get if he divorced his wife for nothing?  I got married this year, but my husband gave me one bā’in talāq within three months.  Even though I tried all things in my married life to make him happy, he ignored me from the very first week and his family made my life hell.  He did not give the gift (from his side) and also kept some gifts from our side.  Forget about the gifts, he did not even give me my mahr.  I do not want to forgive him, but I think that Allāh likes those who forgive.  I know that even if I forgive him, Allāh will punish him.  Imam Sir, he had no grounds for divorcing me.  I am a girl of good character, educated, and I tried to make him and his family happy, but all went in vain.  Please tell me what punishment he will get.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nWe deeply regret to hear the actions of your ex-husband.  Surely, his actions were despicable and loathsome, especially after you went over and above to keep him happy and make the marriage work.  It is understandable that you are very upset at him and have difficulty finding it in your heart to forgive him.  However, note that your aim in convincing yourself to forgive him should be to gain the forgiveness of Allāh Ta‘ālā.  Allāh Ta‘ālā says,\n\nوَلْيَعْفُوا وَلْيَصْفَحُوا أَلَا تُحِبُّونَ أَنْ يَغْفِرَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ (النور: 22)\n\nAnd forgive and pardon.  Do you not like that Allāh forgives you?  And Allāh is the Most-Forgiving, Most-Merciful (Qur’ān 24:22)\n\n\n\nYou mentioned yourself that Allāh Ta‘ālā likes those who forgive.  All of us have committed sins against Allāh Ta‘ālā in our lives and are in need of His forgiveness and mercy in order to enter His Paradise and escape the torment of the Hell-Fire.  Your act of forgiving your ex-husband will not only be a mean of attaining this, but it will also help you in healing your wounds and closing this difficult chapter in your life, emerging as a stronger person and a better Muslim.  Your forgiveness of him does not necessarily mean that Allāh Ta‘ālā will forgive him and not take him to account for his wrongdoings.  Hence, it is crucial that he also repents from sins and seeks forgiveness from those whom he has hurt along the way.\n\nFurthermore, it is still necessary for him to give you your full mahr if the two of you had been in complete seclusion.  It is impermissible for him to withhold the mahr, and he should hand the amount over to you right away.\n\nWe pray that Allāh Ta‘ālā eases your difficulties and allow you to quickly move past this tough stage in your life.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\n \n\nMuftī Abrar Mirza\nChicago, IL (USA)\n\n \n\nUnder the Supervision of Muftī Ebrahim Desai (South Africa)\n\n \n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER – AskImam.org questions\n\nAskImam.org answers issues pertaining to Sharī’ah.
