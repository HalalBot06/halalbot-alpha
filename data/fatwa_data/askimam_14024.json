  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a friend who likes to know why we shouldn't say that my mother or father is like God to me. Please reply with quran verses or hadiths if possible.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah Ta’ala is One and Alone. He is most Powerful. He is the Sole Creator of the universe and all that which is in the universe. Everything is the control of Allah. There is none equal or even similar to Allah.\n\nIt is, therefore, incorrect to state that our parents are like Allah to us. It is possible the person made the statement to express his confidence in his parents. However, that expression will be an overexaggeration as well as portrays disrespect to Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
