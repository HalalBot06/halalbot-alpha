  "question": "When you say that it is permissible to for a hanafi to act as imam when somebody taps his shoulder and makes him imam.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nShould it be the case when the person is praying sunnah or nafil? 2. When the khutbah of jumah is not in arabic but the native language of the country, then also is it necessary to listen to it? I do not understand the language they speak here, still is it necessary for me to listen the khutbah and not pray sunnahs first?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour question raises a fundamental question and principle.%0D%0A%0D%0AAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, the Imaam and Muqtadie (follower) both must%0D%0Abe equals in Fardh Salaat. If the Imaam is performed, for example, Dhuhr%0D%0ASalaat, then the Muqtadi must also be performing the same Fardh Salaat. The%0D%0AMuqtadi cannot perform Esha Salaat, for example, behind the Imaam who is%0D%0Aperforming Dhuhr Salaat. However, a Muqtadie may follow the Imaam with the%0D%0Aintention of performing Nafl Salaat only in Dhuhr and Esha Salaats.%0D%0A%0D%0AReverting to your query, there is no congregational Salaat in Sunnah or Nafl%0D%0ASalat. If a person is performing Fardh Salaat by himself, and another person%0D%0Awishes to join him, with the intention of Fardh Salaat, he may do so. If%0D%0Athere are more than one person wishing to join the Imaam, then they will%0D%0Astand behind the Imaam or if there is no space, the Imaam will move forward.%0D%0AThey may indicate that to the Imaam by touching his shoulder.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is compulsory to observe respect for the Khutbah even if you do not%0D%0Aunderstand it. We also wish to point out that the Khutbah should be in the%0D%0AArabic language.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
