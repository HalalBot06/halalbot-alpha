  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan you translate my Istikhara dream ? Can I marry against my mothers wish? I am a 40 year old divorced woman with 3 children. I wish to be married to a man 13 years younger than me but my brother refuses to give his consent. My mother encouraged me initially but now threatens to disown me if I go ahead with the marriage. I have prayed Istikhara several times and feel very comfortable with my wish to go ahead. Both my maternal and paternal uncles see no reason why I should not marry this man. In my dream I am getting married but am not wearing any gold. My dead father comes into the room with my mother and when he sees me smiles happily and opens his arms and hugs me. My mother only tells me of my sisters achievements\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are positive indications in the dream to marry. According to the Shari\n'ah, an adult has an independent right to marry. It is not appropriate for\nany person to deny an individual from exercising his/her right without any\nvalid Shar'ee reason.\n\nWe advise your uncles discuss the matter with your mother with an attempt to\nconvince her to agree with your intention to marry.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
