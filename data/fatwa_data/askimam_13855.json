  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI live in the UK and i'm thinking of becoming a Local Councillor for the Area I live in. The Politcal Group i want to represent is the Labour party. In the Future I want to stand as MP Inshallah as the Labour party have hinted that they want me as a future MP. The reason why im very keen in becoming a Councillor then an MP is for the benifits of Muslims as we are under represented, and the people who think they represent the muslim in fact represent their own interests.\n\nWhat is your advise or ruling regarding Politcal issues in Islam. Please advise me, depending on you advise it will allow me to make my decision if I should pursue in politics.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYour intention to take part in politics and represent Muslims and advance the course of Islam and Muslims is a noble one. However, the following points must be considered:\n\n1. Always check your intention in taking part in politics. Initially, the intention may be sincere but could gradually be diverted by one’s Nafs and Shaytaan;\n\n2. As a Muslim, you should preserve your Islamic identity and values. You should not compromise in that.\n\n3. Consult with Ulama-e-Haqq and be in constant touch with them.\n\n4. You may also consult with Hadhrat Mufti Kachholvi Saheb of 71 Fairbank Road, Girlington, Bradford BD8 9JU Telefax: 01274-822538. He is a leading Mufti of our times and also a senior Khalifa os Hadhrat Shaykh Zakariyyah [ra].\n\nWe make du’aa that Allah guide you and assist you in assisting the Muslims and the course of Islam, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
