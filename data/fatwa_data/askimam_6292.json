  "answer": "QUESTION\nI read that in Hadith, that we should not blow in a vessel. So is it haraam to blow while drinking something hot? I would like to know that if in witr salat, you forget to pray dua-e qanoot and finish the salat is it valid or not?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is Makrooh (detestable) to blow in a utensil or food in such a way that\ngives a sound. (Shaami part6 pg.340)\n\n2. The recitation of any Du'aa after the Surah in the third Rakaat of Witr is\nWaajib. If no Du'aa at all was recited, then it is Waajib to repeat that\nSalaat. If any Du'aa was recited then the Salaat will be valid. However, the\nDu'aa-e-Qunoot specifically is Sunnat. (Ahsanul Fataawa part3 pg.449)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
