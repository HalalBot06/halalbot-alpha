  "question": "Being in a building with a non mahram woman but in seperate rooms.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like to start a charitable clinic.For this I will be keeping a female nurse so that injections/dressings be given to female patients.She will be working in a separate room.When there are no patients we will be alone though in seperate rooms.Clinic is situated in an open public place where anyone can come in at any time.Can I practice this way?Will this problem be solved if I keep another male or female as assistents?.Hope you will answer this question.Assalamu alaikum.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'No male should be in\nisolation with a (non-Mahram) female.'\n\nIn view of the above Hadith, it is not permissible to be alone with females.\nThe Fuqahaa (jurists) have stated that a patient may be treated by a\nPhysician of the opposite gender on condition that be limited to the subject\nmatter. It is not permissible to trespass the limits of the subject matter\nas that poses many dangers especially, in these times of corruption when\nlicentious and illicit relationship between physicians and patients are\nreported in the media. It is therefore, advisable for a patient to consult a\nphysician of his or her gender.\n\nYou may set up a clinic bearing in mind the abovementioned points.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
