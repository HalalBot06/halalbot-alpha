  "question": "My husband believes that I am being too orthodox in wearing niqaab. Please advise.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-alaikum, Mufti Sahab, My husband and I performed Hajj this year, and after we returned, I began to wear full niqaab. This has been a real test for me socially as very few women actually observe this in the States. Furthermore, my husband seems to have taken it the hardest. Since I began wearing it our relationship has become rather strained. He feels that I am being too orthodox, since some scholars advocate that a woman's face may remain uncovered when observing hijaab. He has become withdrawn and is exhibiting signs of depression (feeling lethargic and sleepy all the time, not eating properly). He has not forbidden me to wear it, but his depression is scaring me. I want to do this for the sake of Allah SWT. Please advise me. JazakAllah-Khair and may Allah reward you for this wonderful service.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour zeal to wear the Niqaab is commendable. Ideally, your husband should\nalso encourage you to do so as your beauty is exclusively for him - not for\nall and sundry.\n\nIf he does not understand that, and that is the cause of a strained\nrelationship between both of you, then removing the Niqaab will be lesser of\nthe two evils - exposing the face Vs marital dispute. You will be excused.\nThe sin of exposing your face will be upon your husband. We suggest you\ndiscuss the issue with him and probably engage him to discuss the matter\nwith us as well. He may need to be encouraged.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
