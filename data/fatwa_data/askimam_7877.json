  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs a doctor here in America it is difficult for me to avoid female patients. Some scholars have said this is OK because of lack of muslim doctors serving the community here, it this right? What can be done?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, a female may consult a male doctor out of necessity. (Hidaaya)\n\nIt is better if this is done in the presence of a Mahram. However, if there are female doctors available, the woman should consult female doctors rather than male doctors.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
