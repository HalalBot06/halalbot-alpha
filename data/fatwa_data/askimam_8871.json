  "answer": "QUESTION\nslmz,moulana im a bit confused regarding the fatwa on the pants being above the ankles.some ulama r of the opinion that one has2wear it,whilst sum say,1mus not wear it cos of pride.authentic hadith pls.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is narrated from Hadhrat Abu Zarr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Three groups of people Allah will not%0D%0Atalk to on the day of Qiyaamat nor will he look to them nor will he purify%0D%0Athem and for them is severe punishment'. Hadhrat Abu Dharr (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhu) says, 'Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said this three times.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Dharr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) said, 'May they be losers. Who are%0D%0Athey O Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).'%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'He who wears his pants below his%0D%0Aankles. The one who talks of that good which he did for a person and that%0D%0Aperson who sells his goods with false oaths.' (Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn this Hadith, firstly, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) speaks about%0D%0Athose people who wear their pants below their ankles out of pride. This is a%0D%0Avery grave sin. What could be worse than Allah Ta'ala not speaking to a%0D%0Aperson, not even looking at him and dooming him to a painful punishment.%0D%0A%0D%0AFurthermore, it is narrated from Hadhrat Abdullah ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhu). He says Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'That part below the%0D%0Aankles which is covered by the pants will be in the fire of hell. Nowadays,%0D%0Awhen you remind a person to raise his pants above his ankles. He says, 'The%0D%0AHadith only mentions it in regards to those people who do it out of pride.%0D%0AThis is quite a widespread misconception which is dealt with in the%0D%0Afollowing Hadith:%0D%0A%0D%0ASayyiduna Jaabir ibn Saleem (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Be careful with regards to dragging%0D%0Ayour clothes (below the ankles), for verily it is from the acts of pride.'%0D%0A(Sunan Abu Dawud)%0D%0A%0D%0AHere, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) explains to us that the act%0D%0Aof letting the pants go below the ankles is in itself an act of pride. (See%0D%0AFathul Baari vol.10 pg.210)%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd as for Salaat in this condition, Sayyiduna ibn Mas'ood (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhu) is reported to have said that such a person is out of the protection%0D%0Aof Allah Ta'ala. (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala save us all, Aameen%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
