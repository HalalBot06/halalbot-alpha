  "question": "I had a conflict between my wife's father and now it has made our relationship very miserable.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs salaam wu alaikum.I have been married for over a year now and have a beautiful baby girl.I love my wife very much and I am sure she loves me too.The problem is that recently there was an argument between me and her father which resulted in me saying that I do not want anyhting to do with him.This has now resulted in alot of tension between me and my wife.To give a bit of history is that me and my father in law were never in the best of books since the marriage.I guess he is an extrovert whereas I am an introvert. I have however always respected him and kept our relationship on talking terms and visiting three to four times a month.However there was an issue between him and my wife when she gave birth which resulted in me not keeping in contact with him.Ironically my wife and him has sort of made up, but my relationship has gotten worse.To sum things up, I would just like to know what right's to I have as a husband to limit my wifes visit to her father and also is it fair to ask her to restrict her from having too much of a conversation with him when she visits.I will however not visit him for a while.Please help urgently.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPlease be informed that the ask-imam.com site will not answer social related queries.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
