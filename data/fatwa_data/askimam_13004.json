  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Holy Quran was revealed upon Rasulullah sallallahu alaih wa sallam only. However some of the ayats of the Quran were revealed because of the Sahabah s, (i.e. due to something they did). This ayat of Surah Al-Mumtahinah is a perfect example. This is how it was revealed:- %0D%0A%0D%0AIt so happened that a Sahabi Hatib bin Abi Balta a became muslim and migrated to Madinah. His family was in Makkah. After the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam and the Sahaba s (Muhajireen) migrated to Madina, the mushrikeen (disbelievers) would trouble and tease the Muslims who were left in Makkah. %0D%0AThose Muhajireen who had relatives in Makkah, had some amount of protection for their families, but Hatib radhiallahu anhu was worried that there was no one to protect his family and children from the difficulties given by the enemies. Therefore he thought if I favour the people of Makkah, then they will not oppress my children. %0D%0AHatib radhiallahu anhu also had full belief that Allah will definitely bestow Rasulullah sallallahu alaihi wasallam with victory. Therefore to do this favour, it will not harm Islam or the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam.%0D%0ASo Hatib sent a letter in secret with a woman to the people of Makkah which contained the message that Rasulullah sallallahu alaihi wasallam is intending to attack. %0D%0AThis took place at the time when the kuffar broke the peace-treaty of Hudaibiya.%0D%0AAllah told Rasulullullah sallallahu alaihi wasallam through wahi (revelation) about this matter. He also came to know that the woman had reached a place called Roudha-khakh. %A0[Maariful-Quran, p.400]%0D%0A%0D%0ANarrated Ali radhiallahu anhu Allah s Messenger sallallahu alaihi wa sallam sent me, Abu Marthad and Az-Zubair, and all of us were horsemen, and said, Go till you reach Raudha-Khakh where there is a woman from Al-Mushrikun carrying a letter from Hatib bin Abi Balta a to the Mushrikun of Makkah. %0D%0ASo we found her riding her camel at the place which Allah s Messenger sallallahu alaihi wa sallam had mentioned. We said (to her), (Give us) the letter. %0D%0AShe said, I have no letter. %0D%0AThen we made her camel kneel down and we searched, but we did not find any letter. Then we said, Certainly, Allah s Messenger sallallahu alaihi wa sallam had not told us a lie. Take out the letter; otherwise we will strip you naked (to search for the letter). When she saw that we were determined, she put her hand below her waist belt, for she had tied her cloak round her waist, and she took out the letter, and we brought it to Allah s Messenger sallallahu alaihi wa sallam. %0D%0AThen Umar radhiallahu anhu said, O Allah s Messenger! (This Hatib) has betrayed Allah, His Messenger sallallahu alaihi wa sallam and the believers! Let me cut off his neck! %0D%0AThe Prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam said, He has spoken the truth; do not say to him but good. %0D%0AUmar rashiallahu anhu said, He has betrayed Allah, His Messenger sallallhu alaihi wa sallam, and the faithful believers. Let me cut off his neck! %0D%0AThe Prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam said, Is he not one of the Badr warriors? May be Allah looked at the Badr warriors and said, Do whatever you like, for jannat is wajib upon you; or He said: as I have forgiven you. %0D%0AOn hearing this, tears came out of Umar s eyes, and he said, Allah and His Messenger sallallhu alaihi wa sallam know better. [Bukhari, chapter of Maghazi] %0D%0A%0D%0AUpon this incident Allah taala revealed in the Holy Quran the first verse of Surah Mumtahinah which is as follows:-%0D%0A%0D%0AO you who believe! Take not My enemies and your enemies (disbelievers) as friends, showing affection towards them, while they have disbelieved in what has come to you of the truth (Islamic monotheism, this Quran, and Muhammad sallallhu alaihi wa sallam) and have driven out the Messenger (Muhammad sallallhu alaihi wa sallam) and yourselves (from your homeland) because you believe in Allah your Lord! If you have come forth to strive in My Cause and to seek My Good Pleasure, (then take not these disbelievers as your friends). You show friendship to them in secret, while I am All-Aware of what you conceal and what you reveal. And whosoev er of you (Muslims) does that, then indeed he has gone (far) astray from the Straight Path. [V.60:1]%0D%0A%0D%0ABe aware that we should not think of any Sahabah as bad because of what they did. Through this one mistake we learn the morals of it. For example, %0D%0AWe get the hint that until a kafir stays a kafir, he will never be a FRIEND to a Muslim until he stays Muslim. They ARE Allah s enemies, whereas a Muslim loves Allah and calls out to Allah, so how can there be a friendship between the kafir and Muslim?%0D%0AIn this ayat we also learn they have driven out the Messenger and yourselves (from your homeland) because you believe in Allah your Lord! %0D%0AThey did not take you out for a worldly reason; No! it was only because of your Iman (belief). This clearly states to us that until we are Mu min, they will not be our friends. This indicates towards the way Hatib radhiallahu anhu thought that if I do a favour upon them then in return they will protect my children. This thought is wrong, because they are your enemies due to your belief. Until your belief is not taken away, (may Allah save us all), then to keep friendship with them is deceived.%0D%0AThis verse also indicates that if your migration was for Allah s pleasure, then how can you expect the kafir enemies to have some kindness for you. %0D%0AWe also learn that those people who keep a friendship with the kuffar in secret, then do not think that this action of yours is hidden, for Allah is All-Aware of what you conceal and what you reveal%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
