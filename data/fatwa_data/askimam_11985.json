C) What should i do if I get my hands on haram money?, Should I throw it away? because I cant keep because I dont want HARAM stuff and I cant give money to masjid.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMashallah, it is very good to see your enthusiasm to earn an halal livelihood. May Allah bless your sustenance and accept you for his din. %0D%0A%0D%0AWe will answer all your queries together inshallah.%0D%0A%0D%0AHaving a clothing shop is permissible and the income therefrom is Halaal even if revealing clothing is sold there. This is because clothing is dual purpose ie. it could be worn in public or solely for ones husband. Parading in public with such clothing is up to the person who bought the item, you aren't responsible for it. So the money earned by you and your father is halaal, however a few thing aspects need to be discussed:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Women entering the store- you will have to ensure that you lower your gaze when they enter.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Music- Music is Haraam and causes hypocrisy in the heart. By your father playing music in the shop, not only is he getting the sin of listening to music, but is getting the sin of making so many others listen to it as well. If you really care for your father, you would make a concerted effort to stop him from this wrong. Get articles on the topic and leave them where he would read them. Make dua and ask Allah to soften his heart and when he seems in a good mood broach the topic in a tactful manner, telling him how much you love him and only want whats good for him. Ask him that if you saw him walking towards a hole, wouldn't it be your duty to stop him before he falls in? Similarly, by him playing music, he his flinging himself into jahannum, thus it is your responsibility as his loving son to save him from there.%0D%0A%0D%0AExplain to him , that barakah (blessings) in sustenance comes from Allah while the disobedience of Allah destroys these blessings. By playing music in the store, your father is not only destroying his Jannah, but his profits as well!%0D%0A%0D%0ATry your utmost to explain this to him. If he refuses to budge and you don't see any hope of him accepting, then you should seek alternative employment. Once you find it, lovingly explain to your father that you care for him and want to help him, but the orders of Allah have to be given preference to, over everything else. %0D%0A%0D%0AThe money you have earned is Halaal. If you ever get haraam money, you should dispose of it by giving it away to the poor. Throwing it away is not correct.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah make it easy for you and soften the heart of your father. Amin%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMl. Husain Kadodia%0D%0ASTUDENT: Darul Ifta%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
