  "answer": "QUESTION\nI know that, if I make my parents happy then Allah is happy. But if I get married to a girl from Bangladesh that cant speak english, then I feel as if we will not be compatible.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to Shari'ah, an adult (boy and girl) reserve the right to marry a\npartner of his/her choice. However, due to marriage being a major step in\none's life, it is advisable to make Mashwara (consult) with your seniors as\nwell as make Istikhaara (seek divine guidance). Somewhere on this site,\nsearch 'Istikhaara' (without quotes).\n\nYou should also consider the advise of your parents as it is motivated by\ntheir love and concern for you.\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
