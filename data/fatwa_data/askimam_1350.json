  "question": "I work as a salesperson in a mobil phone co. Is this job haram if this company is publicly traded?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAccording to my parents a job in a company is haram if they started their business by borrowing money on interest. It is also haram if they are publicly traded or if they have any bank accounts in the bank that earn interest. I am not involved in any of the transactions. All I do is sell or service. Due to this my parents have threatened me that they will not keep any contact with me. Am i doing wrong by not following their order. Please clarify.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour sales and service at the mobile phone company is permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
