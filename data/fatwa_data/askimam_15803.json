  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know what is the islamic significance of celebrating the 1st 10 days of Muharram, where women go to the person's house around asar time and pray, and then sweets, or laan is given out to the children and women that are present,every day, with the biggest laan given on the 10th of Muharram/\n\nIs this just a mere tradition or does it have a shariah significance?\n\nI ask this because i have moved to a new town and it is the first time i have seen this being done.\n\nIs there any harm in doing it?\n\nWhat would be your advise to me?  I have not attended the prayers, i have heard of it only.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1.      The month of Muharram has significance in the Shari`ah. ALLAH TA`AALA has mention in the noble Quraan regarding this month:-\n\nإِنَّ عِدَّةَ الشُّهُورِ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ اثْنَا عَشَرَ شَهْرًا فِي كِتَابِ اللَّهِ يَوْمَ خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ مِنْهَا أَرْبَعَةٌ حُرُمٌ\n\n“Verily the number of months according to ALLAH is twelve, in the decree of ALLAH on the day HE created the heavens and earth, of them four are sacred.”\n\n(Surah Taubah verse 35)\n\nThese four sacred months are Zul Qa`dah, Zul Hijjah, Muharram and Rajab.\n\n\nImaam al-Raazi commentates on this verse; explaining that the rewards for good actions are multiplied and likewise the punishment for sins perpetrated in these months are multiplied.\n\n   ومعنى الحرم : أن المعصية فيها أشد عقاباً ، والطاعة فيها أكثر ثواباً ، والعرب كانوا يعظمونها جداً حتى لو لقي الرجل قاتل أبيه لم يتعرض له .\n\n(Tafseer ar-Raazi Vol.8 Pg. 54 Darul Fikr)\n\nMufti Taqi Usmaani explains in Ma`aariful Quraan that the sacredness of these months where initially to prevent fighting and waging wars. That ruling was abrogated. However he states that the sacredness and respect of these months still remain with regards to the multiplications of good and sinful actions.\n\n2.      The tenth day of Muharram is of great significance. Known as the day of Ashurah.\n\nNabi (صلى الله عليه و سلم) had attached great significance to this day. Aiesha (رضى الله عنهما) stated that Nabi(صلى الله عليه و سلم) commanded with the fasting of Ashurah before Ramadhaan became compulsory.\n\nحَدَّثَنَا حَرْمَلَةُ بْنُ يَحْيَى أَخْبَرَنَا ابْنُ وَهْبٍ أَخْبَرَنِى يُونُسُ عَنِ ابْنِ شِهَابٍ أَخْبَرَنِى عُرْوَةُ بْنُ الزُّبَيْرِ أَنَّ عَائِشَةَ - رضى الله عنها - قَالَتْ كَانَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ -صلى الله عليه وسلم- يَأْمُرُ بِصِيَامِهِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُفْرَضَ رَمَضَانُ فَلَمَّا فُرِضَ رَمَضَانُ كَانَ مَنْ شَاءَ صَامَ يَوْمَ عَاشُورَاءَ وَمَنْ شَاءَ أَفْطَرَ.\n\n (Sahih Muslim)\n\n In the light of the Ahaadith it is a good and reward able action to fast on the ninth and tenth, and to keep in mind the sacredness of the month. The practices you mentioned are baseless, no proof of such actions are found in the Shari`ah. These seem to be purely traditions and customs that people have introduced.\nIf these customs are deemed to be part of the shariah then it will be incumbent upon you that you refrain from participating in those activities. Because that constitutes bid`ah(innovations) which is strongly prohibited in shari`ah.\n\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
