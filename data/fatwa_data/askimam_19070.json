  "question": "My family does not like Islam. They think it is terrorism. I am not talking to them about it now as it offends them. How should I tell them things?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy name is Devisha. I am a doctor and I have accepted Isalm. There are certain things i want to ask.\n\n1)     First, if I change my name from Devisha (meaning like goddess) to Divisha (meaning divine wish of time) is it ok in islam? I come from a hindu bhramin family.\n\n2)     Also, is it needed to wear hijab when one examines a patient?\n\n3)     My family doesn’t like Islam. They think it’s terrorism. I have tried talking to them but it didn’t work. I don’t want to lose my family. They think I am learning Islam because of someone who is trying to brain wash me. I am not able to do anything about it. I am not talking about it now as it offends them, but I want them to know about it.  How should I tell them things? I am alone with so many things around, the only one I have is ALLAH. I need guidance from him.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nIn reply to your queries kindly find the following replies:\n\n1)       In regards to changing your name; it is preferable for you to change your name from Devisha which has a polytheist connotation to a more Islamic name. Despite the fact that it would be permissible for you to change your name to Divisha, we would like to suggest that you change your name to Aisha. Aisha was the name of the most beloved wife of Rasulullah (Salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam). Insha Allah, by changing your name to her name, it is hoped that you will also adopt her habits and traits; thus, it will serve as a great benefit for you in this world and in the hereafter.\n\n2)       The laws of hijab are only relaxed for one’s immediate family and other Muslim females. Therefore, whenever you are examining non-Muslim females or males of any faith who have reached the age of maturity, you must remain in your hijab.\n\n3)       Unfortunately, due to the high influx of negative media against Islam, many people have the wrong conception of Islam. They equate Islam with terrorism when in fact, Islam is completely opposed to terrorism. We would advise you to adopt the best manners and character with your family in an attempt to win them over to Islam and to show them that the media propaganda against Islam is completely false and baseless. This is by no means an easy task; however, with patience and consistency, insha Allah, you will definitely see a positive change in your family. Good morals and manners have the effect of melting the hardest of hearts. The greatest enemies of Rasulullah (Salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam) who used to strive to assassinate him became the most ardent of followers and lovers after witnessing his most beautiful character and learning the truth of Islam. We make dua that Allah Ta’ala soften the hearts of your family and guides them to Islam through your sincere efforts.
