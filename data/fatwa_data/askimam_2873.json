  "question": "Dear Respected Ulama, Does the Islamic belief include belief in Pantheism?What is the Islamic belief on the hand, face, eyes etc. of Allah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nImaan bil Ghayb (belief in the unseen) is an integral part of our faith. It\nis one of the qualities of a true Mu'min (believer) as described by Allah Ta\n'ala in the opening Surah of Baqarah.\n\nThose verses that contain words such as hand, eyes, etc. of Allah Ta'ala are\nknown as 'Mutashaabihaat' (words whose meanings are concealed). Since our\nbelief is that Allah Ta'ala is unique in his Being and Qualities, and there\nis none who can equal with Him, and He is beyond our comprehension, hence,\nsuch verses are beyond our understanding. We are obliged to bring Imaan and\nfaith on whatever is the true meaning in the sight of Allah Ta'ala. In fact,\nthis is one of the great tests of the Imaan of a believer.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
