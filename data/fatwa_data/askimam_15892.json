  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAfter somebody dead family member did fahatiya khawni and making lunch, for his sawab? Is it true in Islam, please explain. \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is an act of reward to send Isale Thawaab to the deceased. There is no specific way in sending Isale Thawaab for the mayyit. Shariah has left it upon the individual that whatever optional act he does, he may pass the reward over to the deceased. Having special gatherings and making Khatam is not established in the authentic works of Shariah. If it is a custom to follow the practice, then that will be an act of Bidah. Furthermore, these gatherings or Khatams turn out to be entertainment gatherings. The men mix freely with strange women and the purpose for gathering (Iesale Thawaab) is not fulfilled at all. Apart from this, there are many other non Shari’e activities that do take place.\n\nIn view of the above, it is better if such gatherings are not held nor attended. Every person should be encouraged to make Isale Thawaab individually. There should be no special time or gathering held for this purpose.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
