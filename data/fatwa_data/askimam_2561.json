  "question": "Marrying the daughter of one father's wife; Selecting a wife (pre-marital relationships); Imam Mahdi, signs of Qiyamah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nFirst, masha'allah, excellent site brothers in Islam, very impressive and informative, it will aid greatly in education of our Muslim brothers and sisters worldwide. Q1. Assuming, father marries another woman, who already has a daughter from another man i.e., not sister, and from different blood. Is it permissible to marry her? Q2. We are forbidden to make relationships with women before marriage. The reason most people give in favour of pre-marriage relationship is to discover any opinions etc in a man/woman that might cause quarrels after marriage. Especially nowadays where its more likely to find such women, whom are more likely to argue, due to their lack of Islamic knowledge, or be reluctant to learn our righteous ways, after seeming suitable, before marriage. So, what is the argument in favour of not having pre-marital relationship, to avoid selecting such women? Q3. One day our Mahdi will come, in times when humanity is suffering, and the world is full of evil*(in short, but you know what im talking about). I?ve read all the hadiths about the Mahdi. *Does that mean that our world is headed for a really bad time; I mean should we expect great difficulty in the future? Before our Mahdi rescues us... Brothers, excuse the lengthy enquiry, I hope the questions are not repeated, and worthy of your attention. Jazakum'allah khayran.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Your question is not clear. Kindly explain, is it permissible (for who?)%0D%0Ato marry her.%0D%0A2. Shari'ah does not recognise contemporary forms of engagements where%0D%0Aexorbitant amounts of monies is spent on the occasion. However, the%0D%0Aengagement is a confirmation to marry. At that stage, the boy and girl are%0D%0Astill strangers to one another in that they cannot communicate with one%0D%0Aanother.%0D%0AThe premarital outings after the engagement is strictly prohibited in Shari'%0D%0Aah. Often, such engagements break up leaving a devastating effect on the%0D%0Aparties and in particular, the 'used' fianc%E9e.%0D%0A3. Kindly refer attached - Signs of Qiyaamat%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0ATHE SIGNS OF QIYAAMAH%0D%0AThe exact date of Qiyaamah is known to only Allah Ta'ala. The actual time of Qiyaamah has not been revealed to anyone and there is absolutely no way or means by which this time can become known to anyone. Recently some misguided elements have suggested that the exact date of Qiyaamah can be unravelled with the aid of computer. To subscribe to such a fallacy is kufr.%0D%0A%0D%0AAlthough the exact date of Qiyaamah is unknown, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) mentioned some events and signs by means of which the Proximity of Qiyaamah may be deduced. The signs of Qiyaamah are of two kinds. The lesser signs and the greater signs.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE LESSER SIGNS%0D%0AThe lesser signs of the proximity of Qiyaamah mentioned by Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) are:%0D%0A1. Waqf wealth and property will be regarded as private property. Those People or trustees in charge of trust property and money will misuse these to suit their desires.%0D%0A2.
