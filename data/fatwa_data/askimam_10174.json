  "question": "In Quran, Allah s.w.t. says, souls of jannatis and jahannamis were created before they are sent to earth. Please expalin.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nwhat is the purpose or motivation to do ebadat if one's fate is already decided whatever one does? please explain this.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset we wish to clarify that all the verses of Quran and Hadith pertaining to Allah having decreed some souls for Jannat and Jahannam refers to the absolute Ilm of Allah Taala.\n\nThe knowledge of Allah is absolute and perfect. He knows everything ahead of time. It does not mean that Allah has imposed upon any individual anything against the will (irada) of the individual. Every individual carries out deeds, good and bad by his own will. Allah Taala knows ahead of time what the individual will do. Hence, He knows the final destiny of the individual, not that Allah made the individual do the wrong. Every individual will be rewarded and punished by Allah according to his good will and bad will.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
