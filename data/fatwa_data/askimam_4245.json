  "question": "If we had given zakat for particular things (money, gold, property, etc) for a year and if the value of the things didnâ€™t increase during next year and do we need to give zakat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe mere possession of liability free assets, money, gold, property etc.\nequivalent or more than the minimum zakaatable amount is a cause for the\nobligation of zakaat. The increase in its value is not necessary.\nTherefore, if one discharged zakaat on his/her assets the previous year, it\nhas to be discharged again even though the value of the assets did not\nincrease. Apart from the above, all the other laws of zakaat must be taken\ninto consideration in fulfilling the obligation of zakaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
