  "question": "How did the holy prophet take the black seed ( in milk or taken alone??), also how did he take honey?.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI wanted to know about the how our holy prophet used to take black seed, i heard one pharmacist brother saying that the black seed oil doesnt have the same benefits as the actual seed itself since there is no mention of oil in the hadith. How did the holy prophet take the black seed ( in milk or taken alone??), also how did he take honey?. What kind of traditional prophetic medicine would you recommend for skin acne spots?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Regarding black seed, Imaam Bukhari (RA) has recorded an incident in his Sahih wherein Sayyiduna ibn Abi Ateeq had visited a Sahabi who had taken ill. So, he advised that some black seeds be taken (5 to 7) and crushed and after mixing it with olive oil, it should be dripped into the nose. (Sahih Bukhari Hadith5687)\n\nHafiz ibn Hajar (RA) states that it is possible that Sayyiduna ibn Abi Ateeq (Radhiallaahu Anhu) had heard this method from Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). (Fath al-Baari vol.10 pg.179). Hafiz ibn Hajar (RA) thereafter quoted a narration wherein Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) had prescribed that the black seed be soaked in water overnight and thereafter it should be dripped into the nostrils for a certain period of time. (Ibid) he then expressly mentions that the black seed can be used in various methods such as having the seed itself, crushing it, mixing it with some other articles, at times it may be eaten and at times it may even be drank, etc. depending on the type of illness.\n\nHafiz ibn al-Qayyim (RA) has mentioned more than 10 various methods of its usage and dosage according to the nature of the sickness. Some of which are also mentioned by Hafiz ibn Hajar (RA). (refer Zaadul Ma’ad vol.4 pg.273-275 and Fath al-Baari vol.10 pg.179). One should always bear in mind regarding the medication which have been mentioned in the Ahaadith of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) that these are usually mentioned with ambiguity and therefore one should always consult an experienced herbalist or doctor for guidelines about the method of usage.\n\n2. Honey may be taken in its original form as well as it being mixed with water. (Refer Zaad al-Ma’ad vol.4 pg.205-206; Fath al-Baari vol.10 pg.208-210). Here again, the amount of dosage needs to be clarified by an expert in this field.\n\n3. As for graves of other prophets, the Muhadditheen have clearly stated that besides the grave of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), the grave of no other Nabi is known with certainty.
