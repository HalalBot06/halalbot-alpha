  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease advise me that if a woman refuses to have intercourse with her husband then they say the angels will curse her but what if the husband refuses to have intercourse with the wife then what and what must the wife do because even if she tries to come onto him he brushes her off and says not today. please advise and i am pregnant as well so my hormaones seem to be working overtime then before.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe underlying reason for the wife being cursed for refusing her husband intimacy is safeguarding his chastity. When the wife refuses the husband intimacy, that may lead him to think and do evil. Similarly, a woman also has to preserve her chastity. Her only means is her husband. If he refuses her, she too will start thinking and doing evil. The husband would be the course for that and he too will be responsible for that evil. Therefore, he too will be cursed.\n\nÂ \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
