  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Can you please tell if I should go for forty days or four months for Tableekh, if I feel that my family needs Dawat more than any one else. My family members suggested to me that I should stay and teach them Islam instead of going for Tableekh. 2. I am studying in University of Windsor and Summer is coming up as you know¡K and I think I should really work these four months to pay off my student loan, as some on suggested to me that if I don¡¦t pay off the loan now then may be in the future when I start working I will be very stressed and I might even miss prayers while working and paying of the debts. Basically I should go Tableekh after finishing my studies. 3. My friend wants to know if he can Write about non-fiction¡Khe wants to use the concepts of Islam in it and he wants to know if he should go into that field. 4. I am always confused about Islam¡Kreally I want to become a mufti and the worldly things are resisting me. You argue that shia¡¦s are not muslims and I don¡¦t feel the same. My friend is a Shia and he is a very good person. He read you saying that shia¡¦s are not muslim and he got very sad¡Kwhy would you claim such a thing?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Firstly, you must understand that the Da?wat%2FTabligh is for yourself and not for the rest of the world, let alone your own family. Nevertheless, in our humble opinion, we strongly feel that you should work for these four months and pay off the loans. The work of Da?awah is not a work of four months or forty days, rather it is a lifetime responsibility. Hence, you should concentrate on your studies, work to settle your debt and go for 4 monthsafter your studies. This in no way means that you should presently abandon the work of Da?awah. Whilst you are studying and working, you may and you should do the work of Da?awah in your locality, amongst family members, relatives and friends.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Your question is unclear. What do you mean by ?concept of Islam?? Yes, it will be permissible and it is a good field to go into if we understand you to mean that your friend wants to compile and gather true stories deriving Islamic benefits therefrom. True stories of the past showing lessons, advice and good character, e.g. the harms of speaking lies, benefit of giving charity, reward of assisting a weak person, etc. are good, permissible and meritorious.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. We understand your friendship. Shi?as are not Muslims. They are disbelievers and this is our belief. The reason are many that dwelve into volumes. In short, they have corrupted beliefs which render them out of the fold of Islam. No matter how good they look or appear to be, beliefs are in the heart. Speaking lies is meritorious according to them, so they will never reveal anything to you. Nonetheless, you should continue to make Du?aa for your friend and speak to him with kindness and be good to him. Insha Allah, Allah will guide him.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
