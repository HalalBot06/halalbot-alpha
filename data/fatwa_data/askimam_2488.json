  "answer": "QUESTION\nI want to marry this girl but shes already had a proposal shud i go ahead and propose or not even though i know she dont like the guy whos proposed her cos we both want to get married. Her parents are forcing her beacuase she is getting old\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n%0D%0AIt is our Imaan that Taqdeer (destiny) will take its course. Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said that Allah Ta'ala%0D%0Asays, 'O man, you intend something and I intend something (but what%0D%0Atranspires at the end of the day) is what I intend.'%0D%0A%0D%0ANo one has the knowledge of the future, what would transpire and who would%0D%0Abe your wife. Therefore, it is Haraam for one to love, talk, fantasise or%0D%0Aentertain thoughts of a non-Mahram woman. Talking with a non-Mahram woman is%0D%0Ajust like committing Zina (adultery) with the tongue. May Allah Ta'ala%0D%0Aforbid, if one dies with the love of a non-Mahram woman in his heart, he%0D%0Awill be answerable and may be taken to task for it as well. It is also%0D%0Apossible that the woman you love marries someone else, you would then find%0D%0Ayourself having intercourse with your wife whilst fantasising over the woman%0D%0Awho you have Haraam love for. Instead of being rewarded, you will get the%0D%0Asin of committing Zina. Furthermore, the Haraam love will result in you%0D%0Adeveloping hatred and dislike for your wife. You would argue and quarrel%0D%0Aover trivial matters and find faults in everything she does. Therefore, our%0D%0Aadvise to you is to sincerely repent to Allah for your past misdeed and%0D%0Atotally cut off all relationship with this girl. Keep the company of the%0D%0Arighteous and pious through which you will be saved from the evils mentioned%0D%0Ain your query.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe suggest that let time take its course. Only if she rejects the proposal%0D%0Aof that boy, then you may propose to her. If not, make Du'aa unto Allah Ta'%0D%0Aala who knows what is best for us, to grant you a pious, beautiful, soft%0D%0Anatured and obedient wife.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
