  "answer": "QUESTION\n I have a friend who is around 28 years old and he has developed a bed wetting problem for past 8 to 9 years and the problem is not geting away but actually getting worse. Now sometimes he says urine droplets also comes out while he is awake during the day time as well (especially in the mornings). He is very frustrated and dejected with this problem, as it affecting his state of cleanliness. \n  \nNow he wants to go for Umrah and Hajj. However is afraid whether in this condition can he go for the pilgramage at holy sites, which requires highest state of clealiness. What if he has urine droplets coming out while he is Ihram performing Tawaaf or other rituals in state of Wudoo or he wets Ihram while asleep at night. What is the punishment for that and what is the expiation for this (if any).\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nA person with such an illness could go for hajj and umrah. He should ensure to prevent the urine drops from soiling the masjid. For example, he could place toilet paper or something to absorb the urine drops. If his ihram happens to get soiled, he should wash it. It is permissible to wear adult pampers during ihram to save the masjid and ones ihram from becoming soiled\n\n \n\nWhilst doing tawaf if his wudhu breaks then he should renew his wudhu and thereafter complete his tawaf.\n\n \n\nContinuously make dua to Allah Ta’ala for cure. Drink a lot of zam-zam water. Also consult a medical doctor or hakim for treatment.\n\n \n\nBelow is a reproduce of fatwa number 16254:\n\n \n\nhttp://www.askimam.org/fatwa/fatwa.php?askid=0854611113b797b001615b57ea873915\n\nMany people are of the misconception that Ihram refers to the two pieces of cloth one puts on during Hajj and Umrah. In reality, it refers to the sacred state one is required to enter into, in order to fulfil the rituals of Hajj and Umrah. It is only a condition for the validity of Ihram that one puts on only such clothing that is not sewn to the shape of a human body. Wearing only two pieces of cloth is not a condition for the validity of Ihram. It will be permissible to wear only one piece of cloth or more than two pieces of cloth, as long as they are not sewn to the shape of the body and the awrah (the parts of the body that are compulsory to cover) is not exposed.  \n\n (Mu’alim al-Hujjaj Pg.105 – Nazim Kutub Khana)\n\n(Fatawa Raheemiyah Vol.8 Pg.74 – Darul Isha’at)\n\n \n\n In the light of the above mentioned, it will be permissible for one to wear an adult disposable diaper, as it is not sewn to the shape of the body.\n\n This is further supported by the ruling passed by Mufti Rasheed Ahmed Ludhyanwi, wherein he permits hernia patients to wear a langoot (a cloth generally worn by wrestlers between the legs to conceal nakedness) to avoid protrusion of intestines into the testicles. \n\n(Ahsan al-Fatawa Vol.4 Pg.531 – H.M. Sa'eed Company)\n\n Being in the state of purity is not a condition for the validity of Ihram. Therefore, it will be permissible for your father to travel in the state of impurity, as long as he purifies himself before engaging in any act of worship or entering the Haram.\n\n (Aapke Masail aur Unka Hal Vol.4 Pg.106 – Maktaba Ludhyanwi)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
