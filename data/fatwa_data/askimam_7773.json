  "answer": "QUESTION\nI talked with an Aalim, He asked my name and after listening that he told me not to visit ever anywhere out from the home country, even I am engaged and my husband is not working in the same country, I have to go with him after marriage, He said me to break the engagement, He said that I will face very very hard time and it will also bad for others if I will leave my country, what should I do now? Should I believe in all these things are not? I am very much upset since the day he said all these things, He also said it is effect of my name.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe advice by the Aalim has no basis in Shari?ah.\n\nIt is permissible for a female to travel anywhere in the world if she is accompanied by her Mahram (husband or male prohibited in marriage) to serve as a guardian for her. It is also incorrect for him to suggest you break your engagement based on your name and his advice not to travel abroad.\n\nHowever, we wish to advise that marriage is a major step in life and one should exercise precaution before committing to marriage. For that, I am sure you made Istikhaara and consulted with your seniors. If so, now place your trust in Allah and look forward in life which is filled with challenges wherever you are.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
