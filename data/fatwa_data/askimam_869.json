  "answer": "QUESTION\nActually a friend of my who is Christian ask me this question and said that if he becomes Muslim so obviously he can't read Arabic and it will take some time to learn it. So can he use translation of Quran in Namaz while he learns Arabic. I was very embarassed because being a Muslim I cannot give him any logical answer, obviously my answer was No but still I can't satisfy him.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for a new Muslim to recite the translation of the Qur'aan\nin Salaat until he/she learns Arabic.\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
