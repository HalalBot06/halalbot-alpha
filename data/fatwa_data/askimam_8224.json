  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy parents are about to decdie about my marriage and I have few questions 1. Is it allowed for me to see or meet the girl at least once. I don't want to see her and I accept my parents decision but I feel that she must meet me clear any doubts she might have about me. 2. I try to live a simple life and follow religion as much as possible, but I can see lot of pomp and show being arranged for marriage, will I held sinner for all this (because the money being spent is earned by me) What about customs prevelant in family which are sometime non-islamic (but not shirk) . I can not confront my parents because I may hurt then and I fear Allah about it. I have tried in past but they are not ready to change. 3. Is it allowed for my female cousins to get together and sing... they say it is allowed even from the day of Prophet (SAW) 4. How to convince my prospective wife about importance of simple marriage and things like hijaab. I have read on your web-site that any sort of contact is Haraam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Yes, you are permitted to see the girl once before you propose so that you know what she looks like and she also knows what you look alike.\n\n2. Yes, you will also be held responsible for the sin involved if you do not object. You have all the right to oppose even if it displeases your parents. What displeases Allah is more important.\n\n3. This singing of these girls is not permitted as it entails a number of other prohibited practices.\n\n4. Presently, any contact with her is not permissible. Yes, the moment you marry you should try to convince her right from the beginning about such important issues.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
