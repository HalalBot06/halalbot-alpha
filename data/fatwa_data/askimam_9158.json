  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am confused about the following two questions and their contradictory answers. The first question (Q3005) deals with whether Fazail Amaal contains fabricated hadith. The second (Q9044) deals with a Hadith that is in Fazail-e-Amaal where the questioner is warned from quoting fabricated ahadith. Please explain the difference of opinion.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn fact, we had quoted the verdict of Hafiz al-Dhahabi and Hafiz ibn Hajar regarding the status of that Hadith. We have also mentioned the possibility of other Muhadditheen having not classified it as such.\n\nFor further clarity, let it be understood that the task of authenticating Ahaadith of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is dependent on the individual theological conclusions of the Masters of Hadith. That is why the possibility of differences of opinions always exists. Hence, it is possible that this particular Hadith was acceptable to Shaykhul Hadith Moulana Muhammad Zakariyyah Kandhlawi (RA), who was also a great authority in the field of Hadith.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
