  "question": "salaam do jinns exist? and if they do exist, in what form?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJinns do exist. Allah Ta?ala states in the Qur?aan, ?I have not created Jinns nor man except to worship me.? (Dhaariyaat v56)\n\nIn the Qur?aan, there is Surah al-Jinn. The message of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was for all, i.e. mankind and Jinn. Jinns were created from a flame of fire and they have the ability to change shape. Jinns are the progeny of Iblees, who was created from fire as mentioned in the Qur?aan when Iblees refused to make Sajda to Aadam (alayhis salaam).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
