  "question": "What is your view on the concept of intercession?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs Sunnis when we make dua we ask what we want from Allah by adding 'Oh Allah, grant me such and such through the wasila of your Nabi(Pbuh)'. Is this what is meant by intercession, and is this permissable (ie not in any way shirk?) Please could you support your answer from the qur'an and/or ahadith. May Allah Reward You.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaa`, Waseela, seeking Allah's help\nthrough the medium of saintly persons and visiting their graves is\npermissible. Both aspects are proven from Shari'ah.\n\nHadhrat Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) used to make Du'aa for rain through the\nWaseela of Hadhrat Abbas (Radhiallaahu Anhu), the uncle of Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). However, in view of the misconception in\nWaseela, it is important to note that it is not permissible to make Du'aa to\nanybody besides Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
