  "question": "Will salaat be acceptable if the environment is not good? for example, in Masjidsometimes people doing wrong, or in places like Las Vegas?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nHadhrat Huzayfa (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu\nAlayhi Wasallam) said, 'We (the Ummat of Muhammad) have been given\nexcellence / superiority over the people (other nations) concerning three\nqualities: a) Our Saffs (rows in prayer) has to be made like the Saffs of\nthe Malaaikah (angels), b) The entire world has been made a Musjid for us,\nand c) The soil of the earth has been made Taahir (pure) for us in the\nabsence of water.' (Mishkaat pg.54)\n\nWe have been fortunate that we are able to perform Salaat at any part of the\nworld, unlike the other nations who are restricted to their specific places\nof worship, churches, temples, etc. From the abovementioned Hadith, it is\napparent that one may perform Salaat at any part of the world whether it be\nin Las Vegas or elsewhere. The Salaat will be discharged and valid. However,\nwe should refrain from going to evil places.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best <"
