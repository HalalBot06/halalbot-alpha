  "answer": "QUESTION\nI'm 17 years old.I did masturbation for over a period of  3 or 4 years,but I left this bad habit  a year ago.Now the problem is this I 'm regularly suffering from wet dreams.I  sees some  sexy type of dreams  and then I ejaculate mani  while sleeping.I'm also suffering from extreme weakness.I started shivering when I do some work  in quick or some heavy work.\n\nI visited a hospital's website,there thay had written that masturbation is not a bad or  worrying habit.It is a healthy activity for one's body.It doesn;t cause weakness and  other sexual problems.They say it is only one's thinking that this act causes weakness and other problems.What is this?Are they  spreading wrong information?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAs Muslims, we should examine everything in the light of the Shari’ah. Even if we assume that there is no physical harm in masturbating, then too it is prohibite in Shari’ah and also a major sin.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
