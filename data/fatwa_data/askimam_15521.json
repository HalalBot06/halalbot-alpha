  "question": "Is it compulsory to cover the hair whilst reciting Quran?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSalamz,is it necessary or even desirable for a woman to cover her head whilst the Qur'aan is being recited or whilst the adhaan is being given or whilst a dars/lecture is being imparted?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf a woman is not in front of a ghair mahram on non-Muslim women, it is not compulsory for her to cover her head. In such a situation, it is desirable for her to cover her head when the Quran, azaan or dars is being conducted as that is an expression of respect.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
