  "question": "If the first saff is full, am I allowed to start the second saff all on my own?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nA brother told me that it is not allowed and I am actually allowed to pull someone out from the first saff to join me in the second saff. Jazakallah!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the first Saff becomes full, thereafter if a person is alone in the\nsecond Saff, he should wait till another person joins him. If noone comes\nthen before the Imaam makes Ruku, one should indicate to a person from the\nfirst Saff to join him by touching him. The person should be aware of such a\nMas-alah. If the person is not aware of this Mas-ala, the late comer should\nstand alone in the second Saff. (Fataawa Mahmoodiya vol.1 pg.222; Mazhari)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
