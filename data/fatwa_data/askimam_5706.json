  "question": "Why do woman have to cover their faces when it is required to be exposed during Umrah and Hajj?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy lack of islamic knowledge does not allow me to answer this question, and given that islam is a religion without inconsistencies, i am struggling to answer the above. Please assist Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is narrated in the noble Qur'aan, 'O Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)!\ntell your wives and daughters and women of the believers to put upon them\ntheir Jilbaab (shawls).'\n\nAbeeda Salmani (Radhiallaahu Anhu) explains this verse, 'to conceal oneself\nwith a shawl, to cover the nose and the left eye and leave the right eye\nuncovered.'\n\nCovering the face in Ihraam is not permissible for women only if the veil\ntouches the face. However, if a woman wears the veil in such a way that does\nnot touch the face, e.g. she wears a cap and hangs the veil over it, then it\nwill be permissible. Hadith of Hadhrat Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha) states,\n'The riders should pass us whilst we were in Ihraam with Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). When they came in line with us, we should\ncover our faces with our veils without touching it and when they should pass\nus we should remove it.'\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMuf"
