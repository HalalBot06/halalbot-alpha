  "question": "If the spoon of non zabihah chicken is used to prepare any halal food, does that halal food remain permissible to eat",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a question. If the spoon of non zabihah chicken is used to prepare any halal food, does that halal food remain permissible to eat. Jazak ALLAH u khaira.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf the spoon is soiled by the non-Zabiha food, the spoon is considered\nNajis. Hence, if the same spoon is used in another pot, it would render the\nother food Haraam as well.\n\nHowever, if the spoon is clean (washed or wiped clean), and it is used in\nHalaal food, the food will remain Halaal.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
