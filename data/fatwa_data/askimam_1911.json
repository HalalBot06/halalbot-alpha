  "question": "I do have a good friend but we're so different. I have many problems and can't do much in life while she has such a happy lifestyle and I feel envious and jealous towards her. What should I do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised us that in worldly matters,\nwe reflect on those that are inferior to us, for example, if we have a small\nhome, reflect on those who do not have shelter. If we are unhappy, ponder\nupon those that are being consistently oppressed and brutally killed. By\nadopting that attitude, we will be content with our conditions. Furthermore,\nour faith is on Taqdeer.\n\nAllah Ta'ala says in the Noble Qur'aan, 'Do people think we will leave the\nbelievers saying we believe and do not test them.''(Ankaboot Aayat 1). One\nof the reasons of the unfavourable conditions is being the test from Allah.\nWe should submit to the will of Allah Ta'ala and be patient, seek assistant\nthrought Salaat and Du'aa. Allah Ta'ala says, 'O you who believe! Seek\nassistance through patience and Salaat.' (Baqarah)\n\nMay Almighty Allah Ta'ala grant you peace and contentment at heart, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows"
