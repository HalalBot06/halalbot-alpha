  "question": "Please tell me some good deeds so i can try to be a salih.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn sura Al Muminun it says dead people ask Allah to return them to do good deeds from what they left, but they can't. In the Quran good deeds I know are: salat, dhikr, giving money or property. Other things I know are going to jannaza or something like that, visting sick, obeying parents, fasting, reading Quran, helping people or saying good things to them, duas before entering places or doing somethings, and some I can't remember I think. Can you tell me some good deeds I can do to be a salih, and not leave a small record? If it's not too much trouble can you tell me a lot of them?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, ?When a Jannati has entered Jannah, he will not regret over anything except that time passed in the world without Dhikr.?\n\nRemembering Allah Ta?ala, at all times, leads a person towards good deeds. Certainly it is very difficult for a person remembering Allah all the time to disobey Him. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?There are two words which are most beloved to Allah, very easy on the tongue and very mighty on the scale. They are: Subhaanallah wabihamdihi, subhaanallahil adheem?.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
