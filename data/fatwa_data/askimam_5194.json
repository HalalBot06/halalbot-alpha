  "question": "Some Muslims believe that the Sunnat's are mustehab; not waajib. How can we prove to them that some Sunnat's are waajib, not mustehab?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome people believe that Sunnat's are mustehab (for example the 2 Sunnah of Fajr, 4 Sunnah of Duhr, 2 Sunnah of Maghrib and 2 Sunnah of Isha prayers. And they also say that vitr are also mustehab. Apart from that they believe that beard is also a Sunnat and therefore only mustehab, not waajib). They say that Tahajud prayer is mustehab and that all the other Sunnah are also mustehab; not waajib. How can we make them believe that some Sunnah are also waajib? If you can, please give reference from Qur'an. Jizakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, there is a difference between Fardh, Waajib, Sunnat, Nafl.\n\nEach one has an academic definition with specific implications. The Sunnats\nof Fajr, Dhuhr, Maghrib each are Sunnat-e-Muakkadah (emphasized). Hence,\nleaving it out is a sin. (Shaami). The Witr Salaat is Waajib (necessary). By\nleaving it out, he will be sinful and will not be sinful and will not be\ndischarged of his obligation. Just as Fardh Salaat, its Qadhaa has to be\ndone. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Whosoever does not\nperform Witr is not from among us.' (Mishkaat)\n\nMufti Mahmood Hasan (RA) mentioned, 'A person omitting Sunnat-e-Muakkadah\nperpetually is a Faasiq (open sinner).' (Malfoozaat Mufti Mahmood)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
