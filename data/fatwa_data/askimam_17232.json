  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have been married for 5 weeks, the marriage was never consummated and I would like to annull my marriage.Please can you tell me how I can do this?\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nBefore committing to marriage, you must have considered the issue carefully. Why is it that you now wish to discontinue with the marriage? Our advice is you discuss the issue with your seniors before making a decision.\n\nNevertheless, if you finally decide not to continue with the marriage, request your husband to issue you a talaq. If he refuses to do so, consult your local ulama organization for an annulment of the marriage. They will guide you on the issue.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalam\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
