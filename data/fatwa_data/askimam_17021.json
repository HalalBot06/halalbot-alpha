  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nHope you are in the best of health InshAllah. A few months ago i had a dream where i was standing and holding a parchment. On one end of the parchment it said 'heaven' and on the other end it said 'hell'. there was a line connecting the two, and i realised thi parchment to be my results of deeds in this dunya. the line that was between the two had an arrow sitting on it which was closer to 'hell' then heaven. but under the title 'heaven' ther was a higher percentage than hell. I asked my uncle what this meant. he answered me but i didnt know what he was saying. What does this dream mean?\n\n2) A few months ago i had another dream where i was wlking home from high school with my friends. We were talking as we were walking and then suddenly i saw a beast walk straight past me. I do not know how to describe the beast- he was tall and he looked like a fish/human. I then told my friends that the day of judgement is close. Suddenly everyone on the street started walking straight as if they were hypnotized. we then all gathered at on place which i believed(in my dreams) to be the day of judgement. I am 14 years old and i am currently studying in high school. The funny thing about this dream is that i am always advising my friends to follow islam and the way of rasulullah s.a.w. What does this mean?\n\n3) A few months/years ago i had a dream where the prophet s.a.w was giving me money. I didnt take it so my dad took it. Even though i saw rasulullah s.a.w, i sometimes believe that it was shaytaan as rasulullah s.a.w did not look like the way he is described (wavy hair, luminous complexion e.t.c) can you please tell me what this dream means? Also can i just ask one more thing- please make dua for me as i am in need of your humble duas. i have just finished my aalima exams and will recieve my results today. please make dua for me to keep steadfast on deen and to be able to keep steadfast on the sunnah of our beloved prophet s.a.w. once again jazakhallah for your help.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:"
