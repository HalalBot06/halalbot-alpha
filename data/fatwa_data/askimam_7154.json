  "question": "What should a Muslim do when his patience runs out and he seems to be on the brink of losing faith?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI wanted to ask you one simple question. I am beginning to lose faith in God. I keep praying and asking Allah for help, but nothing is changing. It seems like to be a good Muslim I am supposed to follow the rules and be a thankful loser. No fulfilment, nor any success is coming my way. I think that even though Muslims are good people we are very nosey and strange. We become so frustrated seeing non-belivers happy that we kill ourselves. Is there any hope for a person with Imaan or are we just forcing ourselves to be righteous without any understanding of how to live life on earth. And what benefit are we getting from restraining ourselves from the haraam. Are we just closed-minded and self-righteous? I know our recompense is promised in the hereafter but what about the time we are supposed to spend here; Do we just keep living miserably?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Such feeling of depression is a test from Allah. Constantly recite the following verse of the noble Qur?aan, ?Laa ilaaha illaa anta subhaanaka inniy minaz-zaalimeen.?\n\n2. There is always hope for a person with Imaan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
