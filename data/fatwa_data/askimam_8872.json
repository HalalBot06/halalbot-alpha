  "question": "Is medical aid permissable (hospital plan)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nin this day and age,not every one can afford hospital bills,therefore can we have just the hospital plan,so that atleast most of the expenses will be taken care off,incase if a accident occuring.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, all conventional medical aid schemes and insurance policies\nhave three un-Islamic factors; a) Interest, b) Gambling, and c) Uncertainty\nin them.\n\nThe only waiver to these un-Islamic factors is Dhuroorat which is loosely\ntranslated as need. It is important to point out that every need does not\nqualify as a waiver. The term Dhuroorah has a specific juristic definition\nwhich serves as a scale for Muftis to measure circumstances through it to\nconsider a waiver. Generally, the circumstances of every individual differ\nfrom one another. A waiver, in Shari'ah, for one may not necessarily serve\nas a waiver for another.\n\nIn view of the above explanation, it is clear that a general ruling on\nconventional medical aid and insurance cannot be issued. We advise you refer\nyour personal circumstances to a Mufti you have confidence in to assess your\nsituation and advise you accordingly.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
