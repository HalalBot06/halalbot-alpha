  "question": "There are two types of shaheed, first class and second class. Will the second get the same reward as the first?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe first type of shaheed is not bathed or shrouded and is rather buried after offering salatul-janazah in the cloths he is wearing (first class). He is a shaheed of the dunya and akhirah. The second type of shaheed is given a bath and shroud like Muslims in general and then buried (second class). He will have the rank of shaheed with all attending rewards and honours. He is know as a shaheed of akhirah (there are over 40 types of this shaheed). I wish to know will the second get exactly the same reward in the akhirah like the first class shaheed. For e.g. saved from the trials of the grave and the terror of the day of judgement, forgiven for all major and minor sins and married to 72 hoors? Or will he get some other reward? How can a second class shaheed who dies praying on his bed for martyrdom get the same reward then someone who fights in the front line of a battlefield and then dies. It is not fair on the first shaheed for he made many sacrifices in Allah cause? What is significant of being called a shaheed of the dunya if there is no extra reward or benefit? Please answer this with great detail, on all the points I mentioned.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMullah Ali Qari (RA) has clarified in Mirqat (vol.7 pg.282; Imdadiyyah) that%0D%0Athe Shaheed of the Aakhira will not share all rewards and honours of the%0D%0AShaheed of the Dunya, rather, only in a few that are best known to Allah Ta'%0D%0Aala.%0D%0A%0D%0AHe also explains that the higher rank of Shahaadah (martyrdom) is that of%0D%0Athe Shaheed of Dunya, thus, deserving of the highest honours and rewards.%0D%0A(Ibid vol.3 pg.349). Furthermore, there are many rewards mentioned that can%0D%0Aonly apply to the Shaheed of Dunya as is apparent from several Ahaadith,%0D%0Ae.g. Hadhrat Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah%0D%0As(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'No person sustains a wound in the path%0D%0Aof Allah Ta'ala and Allah knows best who is such save that his would will%0D%0Aflow (blood) on the day of Qiyaamat. The colour will be that of blood but%0D%0Athe fragrance of musk.' (Mishkaat pg.330; Qadeemi)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt should be borne in mind that when Allah Ta'ala, the Knower of all%0D%0Aconditions and sacrifices, have seen fit to elevate certain persons to the%0D%0Arank of martyrdom (albeit only in some of its honours), as believers, we%0D%0Astand to benefit and should not harbour any reservations.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) once questioned (the Sahaaba), 'Who is counted%0D%0Aas a Shaheed in your eyes?' They replied, 'Oh Messenger of Allah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)! The Shaheed is the one killed in Allah's way.%0D%0A' Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) remarked, 'In that case the martyrs of%0D%0Amy Ummah will indeed be few .' (Mishkaat pg.331; Qadeemi)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
