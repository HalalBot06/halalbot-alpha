  "question": "TV channel by the name of Istikhara. People call in this program and ask questions whether doing so and so will be right for them",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nA program comes on Pakistani TV channel by the name of Istikhara. People call in this program and ask questions whether doing so and so will be right for them eg. going abroad will be better for them or not. A man call Maulana Basheer answers people's call live. He does istikhara on the spot and tells people that this was the reply he got in the istikhara. Thousands of people from around the world try to call to this program everyday. Please tell us if this istikhara is possible. I do not understand how is it possible to do istikhara like this for someone. People also ask him about their problems. He tells them to recite a particular name of Allah so many times a day etc. For example Ya Allahu Ya Salamu for any illness. To many people he says magic has been done on you and he will remove the magic by tomorrow inshallah. Please reply if this is possible\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The istikhaarah program of the Pakistani TV channel is ridiculous. It has absolutely no basis in Shariah. It is even more surprising that is a so-called \"Moulana\" conducts the program. He should know that there is only one method of masnoon istikhaarah. The istikhaarah shown to us by Rasulullah (Salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam) is recorded in many authentic books of Ahadith. The on the spot istikhaarah is the conjecture of this so-called Moulana's mind. He should stop duping the people and misleading them. The public should refer their issues and seek guidance from Allah fearing and reliable Ulema. The \"TV\" Ulema conduct emotional programs to attract as many listeners of viewers as possible. The general public generally falls for such programs, as everyone is generally emotional. This so-called Alim should stop conducting their program and lead the people to Quran and Sunnah.\n\n2. According to the information and conduct you state about the Moulana, it appears that he lacks sound Islamic education. People should not refer to him even for purposes of black magic and other social issues.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
