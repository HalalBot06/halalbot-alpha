  "question": "Standing and urinating",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Moulana, could you please give me an answer on the question & answer that this brother raised: \"1. A person may urinate standing up if necessary, as long as no one can see his 'awrah (private parts which should remain covered) and there is no danger of the urine coming back on him. 2. It is better to urinate sitting down, because this is how the Prophet(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did it in most cases.\" Although we are very aware of the seriousness of standing and urinating , is this person justified according to the Sharia to state that a person may stand and urinate?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nStanding and urinating is prohibited as it is also the custom of the Kuffaar. However, if one is unable to sit and relieve himself, for example, broken and plastered leg, then he will be excused for standing and urinating.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
