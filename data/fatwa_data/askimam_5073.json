  "question": "Is being aroused by animal on accident a sin and how do we repent?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalam Alaekum. My wife and I were swimming on private beach, and dolphin come and play with us. We play with it but some time we both become little aroused. Is this wrong? Can you show passage in Qu'ran where it says this wrong? Thank you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDescribing the successful Mu'min, Allah states: \". and those who guard their\nprivate parts, except from their wives and those possessed by their right\nhands. Surely they are free from blame. But those who crave beyond that,\nthey are transgressors indeed. (Mu'minoon 3-4)\n\nThis Aayah (Verse) is conclusive proof against all kinds of sexual deviancy.\nIf you are certain that your arousal was caused by the animal and not by the\nsight of each other at play, then resolve never to indulge in such play\nagain. Should you do so, make immediate repentance to Allah Ta'aala and beg\nforgiveness for your sin.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
