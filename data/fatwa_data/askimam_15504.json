  "question": "Matn of the Hadith of Ramadhan Dua",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nBismillah was Salamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullah  Could you provide the exact authenticated MATN of the Hadith containing the dua: \"Allahumma baarik lana fee Rajaba wa Sha'baana, wa Ballighnaa Ramadhaan\" One aalim and Mufti had, in a Bayan added \"ilaa....\" before Ramadhan.  Does Ballighnaa not include the preposition \"ilaa...\" Jazakumullah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe dua which you have translated can be found in Musnad Ahmed (#2387), as well as other books of Hadith such as Sunan-An-Nasaa’I, Shuabul-Imaan and Al-Azkaar of Nawawi. As far as the word “ilaa: being before the word “Ramadhaan”, we are unable to locate tan exact authentic matan (text) for it. Therefore, it is advisable that you refer to the respected Mufti sahib mentioned above, perhaps he would provide you with reference, but as far as the meaning of the dua is concerned, it is correct, because the preposition “ilaa” can be used with the verb “Ballighna” as stated in the “Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic (pg 73) providing the meaning “to take” or “to bring”. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
