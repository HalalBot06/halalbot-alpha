Grave warning is mentioned in the Holy Quran regarding involvement in interest bearing transactions:\n\nيَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آَمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَذَرُوا مَا بَقِيَ مِنَ الرِّبَا إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ(278) فَإِنْ لَمْ تَفْعَلُوا فَأْذَنُوا بِحَرْبٍ مِنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَإِنْ تُبْتُمْ فَلَكُمْ رُءُوسُ أَمْوَالِكُمْ لَا تَظْلِمُونَ وَلَا تُظْلَمُونَ (279)\n\n“O you who believe, fear Allah and give up what remains of Riba (interest), if you are truly believers. But if you do it not, then beware of war from Allah and His Messenger; and if you repent, then you shall have your principal; thus you shall not wrong nor shall you be wronged.” (Quran 2:278-279)\n\nThe Prophet (Sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) also gave grave warnings to those who take part in interest bearing transactions. In a hadith the Prophet (Sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:\n\nعن أبي هريرة قال : قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم  « أربعة حق على الله أن لا يدخلهم الجنة ولا يذيقهم نعيمها مدمن الخمر وآكل الربا وآكل مال اليتيم بغير حق والعاق لوالديه » « هذا حديث صحيح الإسناد ولم يخرجاه وقد اتفقا على خثيم » - - المستدرك للحاكم ،كتاب البيوع ، رقم الحديث: 2220\n\n“Four people are such that Allah will not admit them into paradise nor will they be allowed to taste its bounties. They are: one addicted to wine, one who devours interest, one who devours the wealth of the orphan without any right and one who is disobedient to his parents.”  (Mustadrak Haakim #2220)\n\nAnything attained through interest bearing transaction will always be devoid of blessings as the Messenger (Sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) informed us:\n\nعن ابن مسعود رضي الله عنه عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : « ما أكثر أحد من الربا إلا كان عاقبة أمره إلى قل » « هذا حديث صحيح الإسناد ولم يخرجاه » - المستدرك للحاكم ،كتاب الرقاق، رقم الحديث: 8006\n\n“No one ever amasses anything from Riba except that its final outcome is loss.” (Mustadrak Haakim #8006)\n\nAllah Ta’ala promised the same thing in the Holy Quran:\n\nيَمْحَقُ اللَّهُ الرِّبَا وَيُرْبِي الصَّدَقَاتِ وَاللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ كُلَّ كَفَّارٍ أَثِيمٍ\n\n“Allah will deprive Riba (interest) of all blessing, but will give increase for Sadaqat (charity). And Allah likes not the disbelievers and sinners.” (Quran 2:276)\n\nThe ill-effects of Riba, as mentioned in the Quranic verse above, has never been more apparent in society as it is in this modern era where interest is being exploited unlike ever before. The teachings of Islam are a shield from all kinds of vices and their evil effects, so one has to hold fast to it.\n\nTherefore, if one is indebted with an interest bearing loan, he should constantly repent to Allah, seek his forgiveness and try his best to pay off the loan as soon as possible. He should also make a firm resolution not to engage in interest bearing transactions again.\n\nHajj is not obligatory on a person who is indebted when his debts exceed his assets. Therefore, one who is indebted with an interest bearing loan, should instead of spending his money on hajj (which is not obligatory on him), spend it to pay off his debt – because the longer he remains in this unlawful transaction, the more sins he will incur.\n\nوتفسير ملك الزاد والراحلة أن يكون له مال فاضل عن حاجته ، وهو ما سوى مسكنه ولبسه وخدمه ، وأثاث بيته قدر ما يبلغه إلى مكة ذاهبا وجائيا راكبا لا ماشيا وسوى ما يقضي به ديونه ويمسك لنفقة عياله ، ومرمة مسكنه ونحوه إلى وقت انصرافه كذا في محيط السرخسي ويعتبر في نفقته ونفقة عياله الوسط من غير تبذير ، ولا تقتير كذا في التبيين والعيال من تلزمه نفقته كذا في البحر الرائق ولا يترك نفقة لما بعد إيابه في ظاهر الرواية كذا في التبيين - الفتاوى الهندية ج1 ص217 المكتبة الرشيدية\n\nIf, however, Hajj was already obligatory on you BEFORE you took the interest bearing loan and you did not perform the hajj. Then in this case you should first pay off the loan. To abstain from sin is an immediate obligation. You should prepare your will and make it known that hajj was compulsory on you and make a bequest of haj-e-badal on your behalf, should death overtakes you.\n\nNevertheless, should you decide to proceed for haj inspite of having an interest bearing loan, the hajj will be valid.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai \nDarul Iftaa"
