  "question": "can u please tell me a dua to cancel my marriage, i am getting forced to get married?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs an adult, you have an independent right to choose your marriage partner. You should not be forced into marrying someone against your choice. Those forcing you are guilty of depriving you of your Shar?ee right and committing a major sin,\n\nYou should simply say no if you are not confident of marrying against your choice. The consequences of forced marriages are too ghastly. There are great possibilities of a marital breakdown. That will lead to disunity among many families. The matter will be clouded even more if there is a child born through the marriage. Considering the many negative consequences of a forced marriage, you should never give in to being forced to marry against your wish. It will be you and no one else who will have to bear the burdens in future. You may forward this email to those forcing you to marry against your wishes.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
