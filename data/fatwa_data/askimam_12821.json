Girls doesn?t want the boy or his parents 2 go 2 her house 2 ask for hand cos she thinks its 2 shameful on her. Already had a good sign from a Peer who done Mashwaara/Istikhaara 4 them, What 2 do now?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe advice of the local Imaam to cut off ties is correct. The objection that it is not easy is baseless. An adulterous relationship can never be justified in Shari?ah.\n\nThe boy and girl should bring up the courage and discuss her issue with her mother. She should not hide her felings for the boy. This matter cannot be resolved by concealing it. The girl?s parents should also listen to their daughter and assist her in her difficulties.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
