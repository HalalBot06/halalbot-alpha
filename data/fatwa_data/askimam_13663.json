  "question": "Will I get Gunnah for not obeying my parents?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWill I get Gunnah for not obeying my parents?\n\nMy parents are adamant that I should get married to a guy from abroad but this is contrary to my wishes.  I do not want to get married abroad as I have noticed that compatibility between the spouses is a rare thing.  This in turn will have an adverse effect on my marital relationship, including the good and healthy upbringing of any children that I may have.  Furthermore I cannot picture myself with a guy from abroad at all and find the concept quite disgusting as most guys aren't religious at all and have had a total different upbringing.\n\nI am getting emotionally blackmailed by my family that if I do not adhere to marrying abroad then I would be going against my parents wishes and will be cursed by Allah and any other man that I end up marrying from here, I will be subjected to much difficulties and hardships due to going against my parents wishes.\n\nI have explained time and time again that what I am requesting is not contrary to shariat, rather favourable in a sense that I want my parents to search for a partner who is on the same wavelength as myself.\n\nIs what I am requesting wrong?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYour request is according to the Shari’ah. It is against the Shari’ah for your parents to blackmail you and threaten you with curses. They will be sinful in doing so.\n\nYou should not submit to the unjust demands of your parents, and you should respectfully decline.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
