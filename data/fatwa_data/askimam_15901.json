  "question": "I have heard over the radio that if a person goes for ramadaan umrah it is like going for Umrah with the prophet?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. I have heard over the radio that if a person goes for ramadaan umrah it is like going for umrah with the prophet (s.a.w).Is this correct?\n\n2. With the new quota system for haj it is becoming difficult and more expensive for some working class peopleÂ to go for haj.who is haj farz upon and would it be correct to tell people that they should go for umrah instead.\n\nsister in islam\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1. It is correct. This is supported through authentic ahadith.\n\n2. Umra is not a substitute for farz Hajj. Every effort must be made to perform farz Hajj. This is easy and possible as visas have also been given to repeats (people who performed Hajj previously). This is possible only if there are no first timers for Hajj.\n\nTo perform Umra is also an act of great virtue and encouraged. One should perform Umra as much as possible. The performance of Umra should not be reserved only when one cannot perform Hajj.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
