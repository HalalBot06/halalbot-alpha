  "answer": "QUESTION\ni am an Indian. I have a doubt regarding the number of tarawih prayer(rakaats) to be prayed.Some people say that Prophet only prayed 8 rakaats of tarawih. some say 21. please try to provide hadith regardin this matter. jazakallah khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\nIt is compulsory to recite 20 Rakats Taraweeh. This is also the consensus (Ijma) of the Sahaba. Surely the Sahaba will not unite on wrong. There is a misconception about Rasulullah (SAW) performing 8 Rakats Taraweeh. That was Salatul Layl which is Tahajjud Salah and not Taraweeh. You may conduct a search on the below site for a detailed explanation on 20 Rakats. \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\n Mufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm. Also 10:00am everyday, Q/A 2:00pm and after Asr Majlis 5:15pm. All times are according to British standard times."
