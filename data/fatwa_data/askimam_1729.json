  "question": "I am software engineer, I got a project which is to put the films of international film festival on internet? The earnings from this is permissible or it is Haram ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAlmighty Allah Ta'ala says And do not assist in sins. (MAAIDAH) The purpose of placing the festival on the web is to publicize and promote the contents of the festival, a great part of which is unislamic. Therefore, to be part of such a project will be assisting in sin, hence not permissible.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
