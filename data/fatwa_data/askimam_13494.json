  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCould you please advice me on this matter. Im a student and have taken out a student loan.\n\n1) Could you advise me as to whether it is required of me to pay this student loan before i go to hajj or umrah with my parents or future partner?\n\n2)Am i required to pay off this debt even tho i have not yet secured a job inorder to proceed towards pilgrimage.\n\n3)Is there a difference between the payment of a student loan and a house mortgage in regards to this matter?\n\nÂ \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn principle, if you have taken a loan, and you have that debt on you, you can perform Hajj or Umrah.\n\nThe debt is no obstacle for you to perform Hajj or Umrah. You should honour the payments of your debt according to your agreement or make alternate arrangements with your creditor if you experience some difficulty in paying your loan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
