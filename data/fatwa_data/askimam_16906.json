  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIam feeling guilty and need your help.Please guide me for the followign question, i will be thankful to you.\n\n\n\n\nAs one of my colleagues purchased a land thru one of my relative and my relative has taken commission on that sale. However as i was also involved in that deal, my relative gave some amount to me as well.\n\nIs it correct in Islam to take commission without informing the first party?I want to know whether I was wrong in taking that amount without informing my colleague. (Though this amount was given from the commission which my relative took).\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nÂ \n\nIt is permissible to collect a commission for being an agent. Your relative received a commission from a sale transaction that occurred with your colleague. Assuming that it was not part of the contract for you to receive any commission in lieu of your participation, your relative will be the sole owner of the commission money. He may spend the money as he wishes. If he gifts you an amount from the commission money, it will be permissible for you to accept it. It will be considered as a normal gift. You do not have to inform your friend about the gift.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Ehzaz Ajmeri,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
