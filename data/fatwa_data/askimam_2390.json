  "question": "Muftee Sahab could you tell me if Shaykh Hisham Kabbani is from Ahle sunnah wa'al jammah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was reading an article on www.azzam.com and it was about jihad in uzbekistan. They accused of being with the enemies. I read an article by Shaykh Prof. Abdul Hadi Palazzi where he mentioned kabbani being student of Shaykh Nazim and said he was out of fold of Islam or he had weird views. Please comment JazakAllah khairun.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe have very little information on Shaykh Kabbaani. We are aware that he speaks out against the Salafis, hence, they hurl much abuse at him. Prof. Palazzi is no authority in Islam. It will be fair on us to comment on Shaykh unless we have studied his works in detail. and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best for: Mufti Ebrahim Desai FATWA DEPT."
