  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs self punishment haraam or halal.?\n\nA near relative of mine told me that he Smokes and does some health damaging activities since last 10 to 12 years , Becuase He was involved with a very nice girl but he himself asked her to leave him as at that time he was not very well off. But at the time of departure He promised that girl every dreamed thing that she wanted . And now he thinks that if any of that promises he made to her is not fulfilled he has to punish himself . And After that he never knew where that girl had gone . He never met her after that . Plesae guide me how to convince him if he is doing wrong.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAllah Ta’ala mentions in the Holy Quraan:\n\n“And do not lose hope in the mercy of Allah” (Surah Zumar verse 53),\n\nWhen a believer violates the commands of the Allah, he follows it up with sincere repentance before Allah Ta’ala. It is stated in a Hadith e Qudsi that Allah Ta’ala says,\n\n“The crying and weeping of a sinner is more beloved to Me than the sound of those who are saying Subhanallah, (those who are engaged in the remembrance of Allah Ta’ala).”\n\nOne should never become disappointed and despondent. Rather make sincere Tawba (repentance) to Allah Ta’ala.\n\nYour relative should abstain from smoking as well as causing harms to his body. No one can deny the harms of smoking to the human body. The medical evidence for this is well established. One should bear in mind that our bodies belong to Allah Ta’ala. This body is given to us as an Amaanah (trust).\n\nAllah Ta’ala mentions in the Holy Quran\n\n“Truly! To Allah we belong and truly to Him we shall return”.(Surah Baqarah verse156)\n\nIt will be sinful for your relative to punish himself. Surely our bodies have a right over us and we will be questioned on the day of Qiyamah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
