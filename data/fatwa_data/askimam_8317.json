  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am 16 years old & I am deeply distressed when I look at my friends around me watching pornographic images.I think if they know the consequences of thier actions,it might influence them to stop.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMasha -Allah , it is a great striving for a young teenager to be strong in the world surrounded by fitna. What we found helping our youth, Alhamdulillah, is to first encourage good strong youth like yourself to become confident in their deep love for Islaam. By this we mean, taking this opportunity to think positive, thank Allah Ta'ala for choosing you and protecting you. You most certainly are someone special. Alhumdulillah. %0D%0A%0D%0ASECONDLY:- Take a postive approach to your friends, win them over by encouraging their positive good qualities (according to Islaam.) Always show kindness to them, love , care, compassion, and especially smile - Exchange gifts as Sunnah-to increase love - (N.B -Your sex only and mahram of opposite - not haram intermingling). Encourage towards halaal entertainment - hiking, braai, etc.. Avoid lecturing them. Always show a happy contented mode. However be strong not to slip towards haraam. Encourage them towards the love of Allah Ta'ala and Nabi Akram Salallahu Alayhi Wasalam. Tell them of your duas being answers of positive bounties - not out of pride, but encouragement. In fear and problems discuss how you would resort to seeking from Allah with Salaah and duas with incessant tears of seeking and repentance and how Allah Ta'ala resolved your many difficulties Alhumdulillah - Ponder on this - Note- Verbalising the above actually draws youth who are looking for solutions and needs to identify. You may become the means towards positive identification. For any haraam - boldly and happily say no, for your fear of it's effects like adultery - bringing financial difficulties or like effects of Allah Ta'ala wrath descending and highlighting world events of Bosnia, etc. though always bring a ablance of positive attitude and enjoyment even with permissible humour.%0D%0A%0D%0AInsha-Allah, you will win your friends over. Once you find you're built rapport and confidence in your friends, they will come to you seeking advise etc - Then whatever you say, they Insha-Allah most certainly will follow. Remember you will spread the word of Islaam not by only looking down and preaching but by a warm genuine practical example for the Pleasure of Allah Ta'ala , bearing in mind - 'Hate the sin' but not the person-also make lots of dua for them and Aallah Ta'ala knows best. May Allah Ta'ala use you for His service of Deen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A2SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
