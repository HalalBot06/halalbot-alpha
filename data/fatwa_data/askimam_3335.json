  "answer": "QUESTION\nImam sahib, according to Quran everyone has to taste death. And will be alive again on the day of ressurection. From the Hadith you mentioned in the answer 3224, I understand that it means that earth will not convert the bodies of prophets into dust or skeleton, as normally happens. Kindly elborate it further for our guidance. JazakAllah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is no inconsistency between the fact that every person (including\nprophets) tasting death and their bodies not being consumed by the ground as\nthe life in the grave is only after death.\n\nTherefore, the bodies of prophets not being consumed by the grave does not\nmean that they did not pass away.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
