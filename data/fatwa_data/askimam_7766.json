  "answer": "QUESTION\nBefore marriage, it was agreed that I would visit my family every year. However my husband has not let me go to see my parents overseas in 6 years. I am told to cook clean and take take of his family only. What can I do? My parent are old, and need me as they have no-one to take care of them\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is sad to note that your husband has not kept upto his promise.\n\nWe are certain that you must have approached your husband before. You may request him again and if he does not agree, we advise you adopt Sabr and make Du?aa for your parents. In a helpless situation, your Du?aas for yor parents may be more effective than visiting them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
