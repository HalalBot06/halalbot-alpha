  "question": "I have seen some Muslims wingle their finger once,some twice and some continuously during Prayers. What is the correct Sunnah way?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThanks.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two types of Ahaadith regarding the continual and non-continual\nmovement of the finger in Tashahhud.\n\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, the finger should not be continually moved.\n(Footnote No.5 Abu Dawud vol.1 pg.149). The index finger should be extended\nat 'Laa ilaaha' and retracted at 'illa llaah'. (Shaami vol.2 pg.218;\nPakistan)\n\nAccording to the Shaaf'ee Madhab, the index finger should be extended at\nextracted at 'illallaah' without it's continual movement. (Fiqhul Islaami\nvol.2 pg.218)\n\nAccording to the Maaliki Madhab, one should close his small finger and ring\nfinger and form a circle with his thum and middle finger. (Fiqhul Islaai Wa\nAdillatuhu vol.2 pg.938). There is no mention whether the finger should be\nextended and retracted as well as whether it should be moved continuously or\nnot.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
