  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI wanted to know  its permiseable in our islam to do   eyebrows , we have look beautiful to our husband so what can we do.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n\nIt is not permissible for women to remove or shape their eyebrows. The Prophet of Allāh (salallahu alayhi wasallam) has explicitly cursed such women. Imām Bukhārī r.a narrates:\n\n \nعن علقمة قال لعن عبد الله الواشمات والمتنمصات والمتفلجات للحسن المغيرات خلق الله فقالت أم يعقوب ما هذا ؟ قال عبد الله وما لي لا ألعن من لعن رسول الله وفي كتاب الله ؟ قالت والله لقد قرأت ما بين اللوحين فما وجدته قال والله لئن قرأتيه لقد وجدتيه { وما آتاكم الرسول فخذوه وما نهاكم عنه فانتهوا } – صحيح البخاري 7/83 دار الفكر\n\n \n'Abdullāh cursed those women who practiced tattooing and those who removed hair from their faces and those who created spaces between their teeth artificially to look beautiful, such ladies have changed what Allāh has created. Um Ya'qūb said, \"What is that?\" 'Abdullāh said, \"Why should I not curse those who were cursed by Allāh's Messenger and are referred to in Allāh's Book?\" She said to him \"By Allāh, I have read the whole Qur'ān but I have not found such a thing. 'Abdullāh said, \"By Allāh, if you had read it (carefully) you would have found it. (Allāh says:) 'And what the Prophet gives you, take it and what he forbids you, abstain (from it).' – Sahīh Al-Bukhārī 7/83 Dār al-Fikr\n\nSome fiqhī texts state that it is permissible to remove the hair of the eyebrows as long as it does not resemble the hermaphrodites. However, other jurist explaining the text write that this is only when a person appears disfigured by his eyebrows e.g., the hairs of the eyebrows are too long and cover the eyes. For such a person, it will be permissible to cut his eyebrows to make it look it appropriate.\n\nNevertheless, the shaping and removing of the eyebrows in normal circumstances is not permissible.\n\nولا بأس بأن يأخذ شعر الحاجبين وشعر وجهه ما لم يتشبه بالمخنثين ومثله في الينابيع والمضمرات والمراد ما يكون مشوها لخبر لعن الله النامصة والمتنمصة – حاشية الطهطاوي على مراقي الفلاح ص:287 مير محمد كتب خانه\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Ehzaz Ajmeri,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nConcurred by:\n\nMl. Yusuf bin Yaqub,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nDarul Iftaa"
