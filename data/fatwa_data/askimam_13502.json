  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni wanted to ask you what is the islamic way of doing intercourse, is it allowed to do swimming in a pool where there are families sitting outside the pool. no ladies inside, can a man talk to a women when proposing her for marriage or can he only see her once and the rest of the issues are taken care by the family members. what is preffered, can we read the holy quran or any other religious books while sitting at back seat of the car or lying in the bed. Jazakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. At the outset, it is important to understand that Hayaa and modesty when being intimate with one’s spouse is extremely important. This has a direct bearing on the child that is conceived by this intimacy. It is not permissible to have intercourse in a pool where there are other strangers around as it requires one to expose the private parts which is Haraam.\n\n2. Shari’ah has permitted the prospective husband to see the girl he intends to marry. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has encouraged to see the girl so that the husband does not have regrets later. You may see her once, thereafter, the families should pursue the matter if he proposes.\n\n3. As Muslims, it is our duty to honour and revere the Qur’aan. At all times, we have to conduct ourselves in a manner that is not disrespectful to the Qur’aan. Therefore, if one is reciting the Qur’aan and it is possible for him/her to sit in front, he/she should do so. However, if one is public transport and it is difficult due to seat allocation, one will be excused.\n\n4. It is not encouraged to read other Islamic literature while lying on the bed. One should show respect and sit in a dignified manner in front of Deeni literature.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
