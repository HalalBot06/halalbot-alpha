  "question": "A prospective brother in Islam asked me why Muslims pray in the direction of an object. Why do we pray towards the Qiblah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIdol-worshippers pray towards man-made objects, and the Qiblah was built by Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him). (I argue that Prophet Abraham was not an ordinary man, but a Prophet who was instructed by God to build this house).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Kaaba%0D%0A\"And now verily We shall make you turn (in prayer) toward a Qibla which is%0D%0Adear to you. So turn your face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship (the%0D%0AKaaba of Makkah).\" (Al Baqarah 2:144)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Quran commands the Muslims to face the sacred precincts in Makkah during%0D%0Aprayer which is a fundamental tenet in slam. The legend of this purely%0D%0AIslamic development of a sacred stone structure dates back to the fall of%0D%0AHadhrat Adam (alayhis salaam) from Paradise onto earth at Makkah. It has%0D%0Abeen reported by Al-tabari that Hadhrat Jibraeel (alayhis salaam) flapped%0D%0Ahis wings to uncover a foundation laid in the seventh fold of the earth.%0D%0AAngels paved this foundation with stones and Hazrat Adam went round this%0D%0Astructure following the example of the Angels. Therefore it stands to reason%0D%0Athat Allah Ta'ala contemplated and designated the Ka'aba before the creation%0D%0Aof the earth. It is said that the Kaaba is a prototype of Baitul Mamoor, a%0D%0Ahouse in the seventh Heaven situated immediately over the Kaaba.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Kaaba with respect to the inhabited parts of the world is like the%0D%0Acentre of a circle with respect to the circle itself. All regions face the%0D%0AKaaba, surrounding it as a circle surrounds its centre; and each region%0D%0Afaces a particular part of the Kaaba. Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi%0D%0Awasallam) adopted the Kaaba as a physical focus in prayer as well for other%0D%0Aacts of worship such as burial of the dead, recitation of the Qur'an,%0D%0Aannouncing the call of prayer, the ritual slaughter of animals, etc. Thus,%0D%0AMuslims have been spiritually and physically oriented towards the Kaaba and%0D%0Athe holy city of Makkah in their daily lives.%0D%0A%0D%0ACircumbulation of The Kaaba%0D%0A'Tawaf' or cicumbulation (the ritual encircling of the Kaaba) starts from%0D%0Athe Hajar Aswad - the Black Stone. The circumambulator, if possible, may%0D%0Akiss the stone or may direct his hand towards it saying, \"In the name of%0D%0AAllah, Allah is great.\" He must circle the Kaaba seven times with the Kaaba%0D%0Ato his left (in anti-clockwise direction).%0D%0A%0D%0AOn examination, it will be found that the entire universe which is in%0D%0Aconstant circular or elliptical rotation, is in actual fact moving in the%0D%0Apattern as the Tawaf. The electrons of an atom revolve around its nucleus in%0D%0Athe same manner as making Tawaf, in an anti-clockwise direction. The ovum,%0D%0Aprior to fertilisation actually taking place, surrounded by sperms, turns%0D%0Aremarkably in anti-clockwise direction, thereby resembling the Tawaf.%0D%0AConsidering the globe as a whole, it could be found that the earth has two%0D%0Amovements. It rotates on its own axis in 24 hours causing day and night. The%0D%0Avarious seasons of the year are due to the earth's simultaneous revolution%0D%0Aaround the sun in 365 days. It is really astonishing to note that the earth,%0D%0Ain both these movements, rotates anti-clockwise. The entire universe from%0D%0Athe atom to the galaxies is in constant circular rotation like a%0D%0Acircumambulator who encircles the Kaaba in the anti-clockwise direction. All%0D%0Aobjects in the universe, atoms, moon, stars, electrical current, galaxies,%0D%0Aetc. are rotating in the same way. Moreover, the angles encircle the%0D%0Aheavenly Baitul Ma'mur in an ever-lasting Tawaf. In the same way, the Kaaba%0D%0Ain Makkah is never free from circumbulators. \"Know that the world has come%0D%0Ato an end when no soul will circlembulate the holy Kaaba.\"%0D%0A%0D%0A\"Do Muslims Really Worship the Kaaba?\"%0D%0AThis was one question, among others, propounded by certain non-Muslim%0D%0Astudent groups at a university rally not very long ago. This kind of%0D%0Aobnoxious thinking and behaviour is the direct result of villifying and%0D%0Abeing abusive towards other religions. Islam, known by many a western%0D%0Athinker as the 'champion religion' condemns the idea of disgracing and%0D%0Amocking any religion, but rather promotes the idea of showing respect. How%0D%0Aelse would the world see good in a religion so perfect as Islam. Our aim in%0D%0Athis world should be to convey the magnificent teachings of Islam with love%0D%0Aand honour, so that the word of Allah Ta'ala reaches the four corners of the%0D%0Aworld.%0D%0A%0D%0ADo Muslims worship the Kaaba by merely prostrating towards it? Hadhrat%0D%0AMoulana Ashraf Ali Thaanvi (rahmatullah alayhi), in his book%0D%0A'Ashraful-Jawaab', carefully probes the matter by providing logical and%0D%0Asimple facts.%0D%0A%0D%0A1. It is a known fact to Muslims that we don't worship the Kaaba but only%0D%0Aworship Allah Ta'ala and Him alone. There is sufficient evidence to%0D%0Asubstantiate our stand and belief. Categorically, we explicitly deny%0D%0Aworshipping the Kaaba nor the structure of the Kaaba. Hence, no worshipper%0D%0A(in his right frame of mind) can deny the thing he or she worships. In other%0D%0Awords, Muslims deny worshipping the Kaaba and it is not a symbol of worship.%0D%0AThe Kaaba is only a direction of worship.%0D%0A2. When performing Salaat, even if the thought of facing towards the Kaaba%0D%0Ais absent from the mind too, the salaat is valid. However, many Musallies%0D%0Athat enter the masjid and begin performing salaat without having the%0D%0Afaintest idea that they are facing the direction of the Kaaba, still have%0D%0Atheir salaat intact. Had we been worshipping the Kaaba, then it would have%0D%0Abeen a prerequisite condition to first intend facing the Kaaba before%0D%0Abeginning any salaat.%0D%0A3. If at anytime the structure of the Kaaba is destroyed then too, it will%0D%0Abe compulsory to perform salaat facing the direction of the Kaaba .%0D%0ATherefore, we can say without a shadow of doubt that Muslims do not worship%0D%0Aits stone structure, otherwise by its destruction Salaat would immediately%0D%0Acome to a temporary stop.%0D%0A4. If a person decides to perform salaat on the roof of the Kaaba, the%0D%0ASalaat will be valid. Therefore had we worshipped the Kaaba then Salaat%0D%0Aperformed above it would be incorrect; because firstly, the thing worshipped%0D%0Amust appear in front and secondly, it is utterly disrespectful and%0D%0Adisgraceful to the thing worshipped by standing on top of it. Imagine anyone%0D%0Astanding above their Creator and Maker of this universe.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn addition, Moulana Thaanvi (rahmatullah alay) further discusses other%0D%0Arelated matters on the same subject - the Kaaba. Did you ask yourself at%0D%0Aanytime, 'Why do we face one direction, and not many directions?'%0D%0A%0D%0AImagine if there was no one direction to face then everyone would have faced%0D%0Aall directions which may have caused dissent and disunity in the heart of%0D%0Athe Muslims. Therefore it was essential to provide a common direction for%0D%0Athe Muslims throughout the world.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhy do we face toward the Kaaba in particular and not any other selected%0D%0Adirection?%0D%0ANo one has the right to ask such a question. However, Allah Ta'ala is%0D%0Aomniscient and He alone knows toward which direction His Noor (light)%0D%0Adescends. Whichever direction this light is greatest, we are directed to%0D%0Aface.%0D%0A%0D%0AHow do we know the Noor of Allah descends toward the direction of the Kaaba?%0D%0AOnly those who possess eyes may be able to get a glimpse of that Noor%0D%0Adescending onto the Kaaba. Therefore, Salaat may be read above the Kaaba%0D%0Astructure, because in actual fact, it is the Noor of Allah Ta'ala that we%0D%0Aface in prayers and definitely not any object or likewise.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Jurist have commented that the Kaaba, although seen to a certain height,%0D%0Areaches upto the heavens and right down to the earth's bottom.%0D%0A%0D%0AFurthermore, the secret in facing toward the direction of the Kaaba is the%0D%0Aspirit of worship (Ibaadat), and contentment and serenity of the heart.%0D%0AWithout this contentment there exist no spirit (rooh), which is the reason%0D%0Awe are instructed to focus our sight on the place of prostration in Salaat%0D%0Aso that we may be able to concentrate with heart and soul entirely.%0D%0A%0D%0ATalk delivered by%0D%0AMoulana A Kathrada in Durban (1995)%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A"
