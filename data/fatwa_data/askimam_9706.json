  "answer": "QUESTION\nOne of my friends has a problem with his kidneys he only has the one kidney, so this means he has to drink lots of water, which was advised for his condition by the doctors. Please could you tell me if he has to still keep his fasts during Ramadan? 2) What are the best supplications to keep desires at bay? 3) And what will happen to the people of the earth like the aborigines who haven?t received the invitation of Islam?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. This depends on the seriousness of your friend?s condition. If it is possible for him to fast without adversely affecting his health, then he should fast. However, if fasting will aggravate his condition and there is fear of his condition deteriorating, then he should not fast. He will compulsorily be obliged to make Qadhaa of the missed fasts. It will be advisable for him to wait until such a time of the year when the days are short, thus, facilitating easiness in keeping the Qadhaa. However, if this is also not possible and he has no hope of recovering his health, then he should pay the Fidya for every missed fast.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The best remedy for keeping the desires at bay is the remedy that Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) gave the to teenagers of Madina, i.e. to get married. If this is within your capability do so. If this is not possible, then begin fasting as soon as possible. However, it should be remembered that whatever remedy is chosen, if a person doesn?t guard his sight and keep his heart clean, any remedy will merely be an exercise in futility. It should also be known that desires are a natural feature in the human body. Its expulsion and removal is not possible. A person should take up the courage and abstain from immodest and Haraam gazing. You may also read this Du?aa, ?Allaahumma hassin farjiy wa yassir liy amriy?.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. It is not incumbent on them to follow any Shari?ah for the obvious reason of not knowing. However, such a person must contemplate and ponder over the creation, earth, sky, universe which would naturally and logically lead him to the fact that such a system could only be created by a superhuman power, i.e. Allah, then it is compulsory on him to bring Imaan and faith on Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
