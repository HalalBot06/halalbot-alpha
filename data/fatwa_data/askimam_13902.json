  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have read a hadith thats says some thing to the effect \"\"Nothing can alter taqdeer but dua.\" please could you provide me a reference for this hadith if it is authentic.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThis Hadith is found in Jaami Tirmidhi (pg.35), Babu laylatul qadr ilaa duaa\n\nFate is something which is predestined. In this Hadith ‘That nothing repels fate but du’aa (supplication)’. This Hadith mentions du’aa, to show its importance that if anything could stop fate, it would be du’aa. Du’aa is a very important tool for the believer. The Sahaaba had their needs fulfilled through du’aa. May Allah bless us so that we turn to Him in every condition – good or bad.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
