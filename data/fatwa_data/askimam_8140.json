  "question": "re: 8132 - If so, would it be alright if one holds hatred in one's heart for Yazeed, Ibn Ziad and the Kufans, without cursing any particular individual?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n(1) What i've understood, after reading the article, is that Yazeed, Ibn Ziad, and the Kufans, all bear responsibility for the death of Husayn (RA). Am i correct? (2) If so, would it be alright if one holds hatred in one's heart for Yazeed, Ibn Ziad and the Kufans, without cursing any particular individual? (3) Would it be alright to curse those responsible for Husayn's death, without cursing any particular invidual? (4) I heard a scholar say on TV that Prophet Muhammed (pbuh) was present at Karbala, when Husayn (RA) was martyred. Is this correct?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe marytyrdom of Hadhrat Husayn was indeed a tragedy for the Ummah. There is no doubt that he was misled, oppressed and died as a hero. No amount of tears and mourning can repay the sacrifice he has made and for the lessons he had taught the Ummah. People responsible for his murder have certainly committed a major sin and cannot be condoned.\n\nIt is natural for any true believer to feel the pain of Hadhrat Husayn?s death. As believers, we turn to Allah to deal with those responsible rather than cursing them which is of no benefit. Instead, engage in Dhikr of Allah which can accrue great rewards in the hereafter.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
