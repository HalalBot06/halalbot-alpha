  "question": "regarding calling anyone kaafir - could you give me daleels that one can call someone kaafir (who has been declared kaafir by reliable Ulama",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nwhen i tell my family members that Shias, anyone holding Muhammed (sallahu alaihai waslaam) as Haazir/Naazir (like most Burelvis), those who mock Shariah, they say 'we' have no right to call anyone kaafir (Allah only knows) , i tell them that Allah has sent the Quran (the Furqan..the criterion to judge b/w right and wrong) ..they then start labelling me 'Fundamentalist' (its the best Satan could get out of them I guess)...could you give me daleels that one can call someone kaafir (who has been declared kaafir by reliable Ulama)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou should be proud that you are being called a fundamentalist. It is an honour.\n\nIf we do not have any right to call a Kaafir a Kaafir. Then why do we call\nthe Christians and Jews Kaafir. Because of their beliefs. The same applies\nto these false sects. There are numerous books written where the Ulama have\ndeclared Shi'ah, Qadiyanis, etc. as Kaafir. These are freely available in\nPakistan. In which city do you live, we can perhaps direct you to such\ncentres that offer these books.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
