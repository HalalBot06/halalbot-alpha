  "answer": "QUESTION\nContinuation of Question 5291 please go to the following page www.salafipublications.com then click on regular visitor ling then search for tableeghi jamaat. I think it is important that these lies be refuted. JazakAllah sorry for the trouble\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHadhrat Shaykh Zakariyya (RA) is one of the greatest Muhaddith and scholars%0D%0Aof our times. He has authored several books, amongst which are the%0D%0Acommentaries of Sahih Bukhari, Muatta Imaam Maaliki, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0AHe has also compiled the book, Fadhaail-e-Aamaal which is an outstanding%0D%0Awork as well as authentic. Thousands of people throughout the world have%0D%0Aderived great benefit from this book. The claims of those entics are%0D%0Abaseless.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe great work of 'Tabligh' is in no way the creation of British colonial%0D%0Apowers. Rather, it was the noble work of the Ambiyaa (Alayhimus salaam),%0D%0ASahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) and passed on in this way to us. Allah Ta'ala%0D%0Auses different people for this noble work of Da'wat and Tabligh. Allah Ta'%0D%0Aala inspired Hadhrat Moulana Ilyaas Saheb (RA) who revived this noble work%0D%0Ain this time and age. This work, is a means of uniting the Ummah, not%0D%0Adisuniting the Ummah as alleged.%0D%0A%0D%0AAlso refer below%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AThese were illustrious Ulama of the last century who played leading roles in%0D%0Athe development and enhancements of Islamic spirit amongst the masses of%0D%0AIndia. They have also authored a number of books on diverse topics. One of%0D%0Athe books authored by Shaykh Zakariyya (RA) is Fadhaail-e-Aamaal. Extensive%0D%0Ause of this Kitaab is made by members of the Tabligh Jamaat in their Taleemi%0D%0Aprogrammes. This is why they quote him so frequently in their Bayaans.%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Ilyaas Saheb is quoted so frequently simply because he was the%0D%0Afounder (or rather the reformer) of the Tablighi movement. These Ulama quote%0D%0Afrom the Qur'aan and Hadith or they commentate on the Qur'aan and Hadith.%0D%0AHence, when people quote them, they are actually quoting a commentary of Qur%0D%0A'aan and Hadith."
