  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalaamu 'alaikum Mufti Sahib,\n\nA muslim brother has to pay a huge amount of around Rs. 6.5 lakhs for her daughter's surgery (Cochlear Implantation Surgery), which he cannot afford by himself. I'd like to know whether the zakaat amount can be utilised to contribute for this noble cause, though the deserving person may not be eligible for zakaat for his normal living.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIf the daughter has reached the age of maturity (puberty) and is herself eligible to receive Zakaah (i.e. she doesn't possess the amount of nisaab), then the money can be handed over to her ownership.1\n\n \n\nAnother option is for the father to take a loan for the 6.5 lakhs. If that loan of 6.5 lakhs takes his Zakaatable wealth below the value of Nisaab (i.e. because of the loan he no longer remains Sahib-Nisaab), he will then be eligible to receive 6.5 lakhs in Zakaat money to pay off his debt..2\n\n \n\nMay Allah grant her full and complete recovery. Ameen.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl.
