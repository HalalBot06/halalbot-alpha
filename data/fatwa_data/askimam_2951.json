  "answer": "QUESTION\nMufti Sahib, i am in a complex situation. I have been engaged to a girl for 3 years and originally agreed to marry her. But now, i am having second thoughts, and i wish NOT to marry her. If I were to say no to my parents now with regards to marrying her, it could lead to great difficulties. Please can you help and and tell me what steps i should take, wether I should tell my parents that I dont want to marry her anymore? If i do, there is always a chance of a serious backlash from parents. Jazakalah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe advise you exercise precaution in deciding on the matter by also making\nIstikhaara. Thereafter, if you are certain in not wanting to marry her, then\nyou should discuss the matter with your parents and decide on the best\ncourse of action.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
