  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamualaikum. I am currently staying in Guinea Conakry.  Almost 90% of the population is muslim. Probabaly their madhab is different. I am from Bangladesh and I'm Hanafi.\n\n1) Here they pray Asar something erly I feel. Should I follow them in Jamat or pray by my self?\n\n2) Is it halal to take meat here although every one says it hala (but doubt)\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1.      It is permissible for you to perform salat with Jamaat even though they perform it at an earlier time.\n\n2.      If there is a genuine doubt in the meat being halal, then as a principle, one should abstain.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
