  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am very confused about this SALAATUT TASBEEH namaz. By offering this salaat, all your future, past, minor and major sins will be forgiven,as says in one of ur answers to the question about benefits of this \"salaatut tasbeeh\" namaz.... then why do people bother to kaza/quza (pray the nazma that they have missed) thier namaz. shouldn't they just read this namaz once a week or so since allah will fogive all their sin's.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe virtues of salaatul-Tasbeeh are mentioned in the authentic Ahadith. In\nprinciple, the pre-requisite for a major sin to be forgiven is tawba\n(repentance). The performing of salaatul-Tasbiah is in itself an expression\nof tawba. Among the conditions for tawba to be accepted, one is to fulfil\nunfulfilled obligations, for example missed salaah, unpaid zakaat, etc.\nAssuming there was no need for qaza, people will not perform salaah and\nsimply perform salaatul-Tasbiah in compensation for missed salaats.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
