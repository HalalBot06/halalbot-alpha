  "question": "Assalaamo alaikum, I am writing in regard to your fatwa “A person who has a Shar'ee beard will be preferred over the Hafiz who does not have a Shar'ee beard.”(Answer 4844)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a Syrian Muslim and an imam in a local Musjid. To the best of my knowledge the Holy Prophet sallallahu 'alyhi wa sallam has not specified a specific length for beard. I have not come across a single saying of the Holy Prophet sallallahu 'alyhi wa sallam in any book of ahadith that commands the believers to keep the beard to a certain length. Then, what?s a shar?ee beard? Would you please indicate the hadith that made the base for your fatwa? Mind you, I asked for a hadith, not an opinion of a faqih or shaikh. The shar?ia is based on the text and principle given in the Holy Quran and the sayings of the Holy Prophet, not on the sayings of fuqha and mashaikh or even reverend sahaba (ridwanullahi alaihim ajmaeen). Among other learned men, Shaikh Abul ?Ala Maududi (Rahimullah), a very prominent Islamic scholar, who?s accorded a great eminence in the Muslim world, also opined that there?s no Shar?ee length of beard. Please tell us what?s the basis of your fatwa. Jazakallah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer below our standard reply to similar queries.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AImaam Bukhari (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports on the authority of Naafi' who%0D%0Anarrates from Abdullah ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Oppose the Mushrikeen (polytheists);%0D%0Alengthen the beard and trim the moustache.'%0D%0A%0D%0ANaafi' further states, 'And ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) during Hajj or%0D%0AUmrah used to hold on to his beard with his fist and cut off whatever was in%0D%0Aexcess of that.' (Bukhari vol.2 pg.875; Kitaab-ul-Libaas)%0D%0A%0D%0AThrough this Hadith, the verdict of the growing of the beard being Waajib%0D%0A(obligatory) is deduced. That is because any explicit command of Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) will be regarded as Waajib, if there is no%0D%0Aapparent, clear reason%2Fproof which states that that particular command is%0D%0Afor Istihbaab (preference). This is an established fact in Usool-ul-Fiqh%0D%0A(principles of jurisprudence).%0D%0A%0D%0AMoreover, the Wujoob is further emphasized by the fact that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) did practice on this in his entire life. Know%0D%0Awell that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) did not trim his beard in%0D%0Ahis life (there is no Sahih Hadith which proves otherwise). However, because%0D%0Athe narrator himself (Ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) did trim his beard upto a%0D%0Afist's length, this implies that the Wujoob of keeping a beard is upto a%0D%0Afist length only.%0D%0A%0D%0AFurthermore, such has also been reported from Sayyiduna Abu Hurayra%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhu) and other Taabi'een. (Tamheed of ibn Abdul-Barr and%0D%0AFathul Baari). Therefore, the meaning of our statement that you question is,%0D%0A'If any person has trimmed his beard upto less than one fist, then his beard%0D%0Awill not be a Shar'ee beard.'%0D%0A%0D%0ALastly, for your knowledge, the sayings and actions of the Sahaaba%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhum) is a Hujjah (proof) according to the majority of the%0D%0Ascholars. However, the conditions for acceptance may differ. This is also an%0D%0Aestablished principle in Usool-ul-Fiqh. Hence, the refutation of a Shar'ee%0D%0Abeard by the scholar you have mentioned does not hold any weight in front of%0D%0Athe Shar'ee proof we have mentioned.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
