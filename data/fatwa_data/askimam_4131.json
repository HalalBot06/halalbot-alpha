  "question": "How do you reconcile all the different descriptions of what happens when one dies? Could you elaborate on the actual sequence of events please?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nYou have written elsewhere that upon death angels take good souls to a place called Illiyeen. However you have also said that they remain in their graves where a window onto jannah is opened before them. Additionally I have also heard that after death, the time until the day of Judgment passes instantaneouly for you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe reality of Aalaam-e-Barzakh (life after death before the hereafter) is\nbeyond our comprehension. The repository of the souls being in the Illiyyeen\nand the graves are both supported by an authentic Ahaadith.\n\nIt is possible that the soul is divided into two parts, part of it is in the\nIlliyyeen and part of it in the grave. However, the reality of that is best\nknown by Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
