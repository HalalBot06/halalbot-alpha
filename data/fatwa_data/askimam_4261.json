  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsallam wa alikum. Please interpret my dream i had dream about 2 years ago: I was in my school and alot of litte kids were playing on the playground. I looked up and saw a shooting star ( it was dark outside and i saw the stars, but just enough light so see the kids). The next thing i knew it was bright outside ans i saw a man talking to another man. One of the men suddenly looked staight at me and i saw he was dajal. The next thing i remeber is me and my friend were running around object to object trying to hid from dajal and finnaly we hid behind this one green thing, and we saw dajal performing magic tricks infront of all the small, amazed kids that loked very young. Jazakhallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (SAW) said, The test of dajjal will be the greatest test upon my\nUmmah. Dajjal will perform magic and rob believers of their Imaan (faith).\nYour dream is a reflection of your Imaan and its safety. Inshallah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
