  "question": "Kindly explain in detail the Shariâ€™ah laws of performing Qadhaa Salaats. Your advice in fulfilling the Qadhaa Salaats will be appreciated.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQadhaa is made only for Fardh and Witr Salaats.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn calculation, there will be six (6) Salaats per day, one hundred and eighty (180) Salaats per month, two thousand, one hundred and sixty (2160) Salaats per year. Calculate the number of missed Salaats from the time of Buloogh (maturity). If one is unable to calculate the actual number of missed Salaats, due to not having any records, then he%2Fshe should apply his%2Fher honest discretion in calculating the missed Salaats.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is not permissible to give Fidyah (monetary compensation) for the missed Salaats if one is able to fulfil the Qadhaa Salaats. The Fidya for each missed Salaat is the same as Sadaqatul Fitr (approx. R7.00). The approximate amount for the missed Salaats for one year will be (approx. R15,000). A bequest should be made during one?s lifetime to pay the Fidya for the unfulfilled Qadhaa Salaats from one third of one?s estate after fulfillment of debts.%0D%0A%0D%0AThank Allah Ta?ala for giving you the concern to fulfil the missed Salaats. How will one face Allah Ta?ala on the day of Qiyaamat should he%2Fshe pass away without fulfilling the Qadhaa Salaats. An easy method to fulfil the Qadhaa Salaats is, after each daily Fardh Salaat, for example, after Dhuhr Salaat of today, perform one Dhuhr Qadhaa Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
