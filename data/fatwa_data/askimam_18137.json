  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI made wudhu and after that I start  breastfeeding  my baby,at that time my husband was sitting in front of me and aswe were talking he just looked at my breast,so do I still have wudhu or I will have to make it again as I have heard that if someone looks atyour satr you will have to make wudhu.\n\nis my wudhu valid if I have pen ink (regular ball pen ink) while making wudhu on my hands?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\n1. Your wudū does not break if someone looks at your ‘awrah. \n\n2. In order for a valid wudū, water must reach the skin.  Ink from a pen is porous and, thus, does not prevent water from reaching the skin.  Thus, if you made wudū with ink on your hands, your wudū was valid.\n\n \n\n(ما) أي شيء (يمنع الماء) أن يصل إلى الجسد (كعجين) وشمع ورمص بخارج العين بتغميضها (وجب) أي افترض (غسل ما تحته) بعد إزالة المانع\n\n(مراقي الفلاح المطبوع بحاشية الطحطاوي، كتاب الطهارة: ص 63؛ العلمية)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
