  "answer": "QUESTION\ni had sexual relations with 3 women in my life, whom i didn't marry , now i am going to hajj, i still know them but i dont talk to them as i feel guilty, i have repented to the best of my ability in front of Allah, now i am going to hajj inshallah, shall i apologise to them about the acts before leaving? i fear that they may cause embarassment to me, what would be the best way for me so that i clean myself of them?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for you to have any contact with the women you had relations with. There is no need for you to apologise to them.\n\nYou should not worry about the embarrassment they will cause to you. Respect and disgrace is from Allah. If you have sincerely repented to Allah, He will protect you, Insha Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
