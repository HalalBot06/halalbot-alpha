  "question": "With respect to your response to 4725, as to why people attending the bayaans of Tablighi Jamaat are NOT encouraged to study the translation and tafseer of the Qurâ€™an, the question still stands.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI agree with your response that one should make an effort to understand the Qur?an, and appreciate the list of valid tafaseer, but the question remains why is that during the Bayaans study of the Fazail-e-Amaal is the only thing emphasized, and NOT the study and understanding of the Qur?an. I have attended many many such bayaans, where regular reading of Fazail-e-Amaal, and reading of a portion of Qur?an are prescribed, but NOT the understanding of the meaning of the word of God.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAll the people participating in Tableegh are not Ulama (scholars). They are\nfrom different walks of life. Any person is left free to convey the message\nof Deen as he wish to, that may lead to many confusions.\n\nIt is therefore advisable that such people be guided by a text and specific\nprocedure, hence, the common use of Fadhaail-e-Aamaal, the contents of which\nmotivates one's Imaan. It also has encouragement of studying Deen. You may\nrefer refer to the index of Fadhaail-e-Aamaal. Ulama who actively\nparticipate in Tableegh do encourage the reading and understanding of the\nQur'aan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
