  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) A person does istikhara to marry a lady and it comes positive. But the marraige for some reason can not take place for 5 years. Is it a sin for this man to think of this girl. ( The man has not seen the girl and there is no communication whatsoever) 2)A married male has a poius wife. An unmarried male asks this male about piety of his wife so that it can help him to look for certain characteristic while searcing. IS this asking questions haraam. Jazak Allah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The involuntary and clean thought of the person regarding the lady is not a sin. It is not permissible to voluntarily think about the lady. If he is faced with an evil involuntary thought, he should not entertain the thought.\n\n2. It is not safe to discuss any aspect of oneâ€™s wife to an unmarried person. Piety is not confined to one woman. There is sufficient literature on the qualities of a pious woman.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
