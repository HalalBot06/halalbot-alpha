  "question": "I converted to Islam 3 years ago and have been having problems especially",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question pertains to my mother. I converted to Islam 3 years ago and have been having problems especially of late with my family who are still christians. I read Tahajjud Salaah and make lots of dua that Allah Ta'ala give them hidayat to also change. But recently they have been only causing trouble with my husband swearing him and trying to cause problems between us. It has only been really my mother and brother who have even resorted to phoning my husbands 1st wife and sworn her. I know that Jannat lies under the feet of your mother but this really troubles me alot because my in laws have realy been supportive of me and have alot of love for me. My mother hurts my feelings time and again but I dont say anything and my husband has also told my mother that she will never see me or our daughter again.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\n \n\nWe make Dua Allah grants you strength and courage. Ameen\n\n \n\n \n\nThank Allah that He guided you to Islam. What if you had your family and the entire world on your side but you did not have Allah?\n\n \n\n \n\nIf a person has Allah on his/her side, and the entire family and world on the opposite side, no can cause harm to that person. Sister, be strong and firm on Deen and Islam. It is normal for reverts to face opposition and cruelties from ones family and friends. Do not bother and continue with your life. You do not have to be in constant contact with them if they are troubling you. Keep your distance from them until things settle down.\n\n \n\n \n\nIt is encouraging to note that your in laws support you and like you. That is a great gift and bounty from Allah. Seek comfort and strength through them and progress in Islam. Continue making Dua for the guidance and Tawfiq of your non-Muslim family and friends.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
