  "question": "Does the fast break when you use a wet miswaak, & brush your gums, the water then separates from the miswaak & a little slides down your throat?Also can we use \"miswaak\" toothpastes during fasting?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If you are certain that water went down your throat unintentionally, your fast is broken. A Qadhaa will have to be offered after Ramadhaan.\n\n2. No, it is Makrooh to use any form of toothpastes or powders whilst fasting. If the paste slides down the throat, the fast is nullified.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
