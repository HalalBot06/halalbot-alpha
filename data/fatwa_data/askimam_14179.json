  "question": "Is it permissible for sister to travel abroad for studying medicine (with Mahram), and stay in all-girls residency without Mahram?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThe sister wants to go to either Pakistan or Malaysia, as they are Islamic countries. I'm confused. I'm told that it isn’t permissible for a woman to reside without her Mahram for more than 24 hours despite an all girls environment and I am also told that it is permissible if there is an all girls environment. Could you please explain. I would be grateful if you give the Daleel as it would make explaining her a lot easier\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are two issues here. One is to travel without a Mahram. The other is to stay without a Mahram.\n\nIt is prohibited to travel a distance of 3 days and 3 nights without a Mahram. The 3 days and 3 nights refer to the mode of transport during the time of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. Generally, a distance of 48 miles used to be covered by a camel in three days.\n\nThe other issue is living abroad without a Mahram. There is no specific requirement in Shari’ah to live abroad with a Mahram. However, the general rule is one should be safe and guarded against Fitna and evils. If you will be travelling with a Mahram and living abroad with only females and there is no Fitnah, then there is nothing un-Islamic in that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
