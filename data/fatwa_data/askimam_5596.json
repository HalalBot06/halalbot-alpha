  "answer": "QUESTION\nRefer Q4143 ? Best times to make Supplications; Qur?an Baqarah:186 ?.I answer the prayer of the suppliant when he cries to me?. Please explain your response in detail.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYes, it is true that Allah Ta'ala answers all Du'aas. However, there are\ncertain times or places that draw the special mercy or attention of Allah Ta\n'ala. For instance, at the time of Tahajjud or within the Haram Shareef at\nMakkah.\n\n'Comind down to the first sky', etc. is not in its literal sense. It could\nmean that His Tajalliyaat (Hid Divine light) comes down or the words 'coming\ndown' is used in a form of Tamtheel (portrayal or exemplification) of Allah\nTa'ala's special attention towards something.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
