  "question": "Meaning of the name 1) Shaheen & 2) Afroz : Is these are islamic names and mentioned in any of our holy books",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShaheen (persian) - a white coloured raptor (bird of prey).\n\nAfroz (Persian) - lightbringer or illuminator, generally used as a suffix,\ne.g. Jahhaan Afroz - lightbringer to the world.\n\nThese words, being Persian, do not appear in either the Qur'aan or Ahaadith.\nHowever, being possessed of good connotations, they are suitable names,\nalthough keeping Arabic names is preferable.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
