  "question": "No.6494 - a divorced couple wants to re-marry between them, they have to carry out Halaalah. Doesn't it look very complicated process. Why is such a complication when the couple wants to re-join",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI received your answers for my question (question No.6494). Jizak-Allah-Khair. You have explined me the concept of divorce in Islam. In that, you have mentioned that suppose a divorced couple wants to re-marry between them (not with other spouses) they have to carry out Halaalah. Doesn't it look very complicated process, i.e doesn't it very complicated that the woman marry another man, consumates with him and gettibg divorced by him. Why is such a complication when the couple wants to re-join in their life? Why don't they simply marry between them? NB: Your answer for my previous question reaches very quick. Thank you very much for that.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe rule of Halaalah applies in the case where the husband gave three\ndivorces. If the husband gave one or two divorces, the couple can remarry\nwithout Halaalah. This is the law of Allah Ta'ala, which we do not question.\n\nHowever, one reason we can understand is that in this way, Allah Ta'ala is\npreventing divorce from becoming a toy to play with. If this rule was not\nthere, the couple can continue to divorce and remarry on and on. This makes\na mockery of divorce. Hence, the Shari'ah has allowed two opportunities for\npossible mistakes. On the third occasion, the Shari'ah has made it very\nstrict, so that the act of divorce should not be taken lightly.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
