  "question": "What is the meaning of the name Luqman? Was he a Prophet? Please list out his advices/teachings.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is a difference of opinion as to whether Luqmaan (Alayhis salaam) was%0D%0Aa prophet or not. However, the view of majority of the Ulama is that he was%0D%0Anot a Nabi. He was a Hakeem (person full of wisdom). (Ma'ariful Qur'aan)%0D%0A%0D%0AThere are plenty of words of wisdom narrated from Luqmaan (Alayhis salaam).%0D%0AWahb ibn Munabbih (RA) says, 'I have learnt%2Fread more than 10,000 chapters%0D%0Aof wisdom of Luqmaan (Alayhis salaam).' (Ibid vol.7 pg.35). Therefore, we%0D%0Awould just suffice on some of the advices that have been mentioned by Allah%0D%0ATa'ala:%0D%0A'And (remember) when Luqmaan said to his son when he was advising him, 'O My%0D%0Ason! Join not in worship others with Allah. verily, joining others in%0D%0Aworship with Allah is a great Dhulm (wrong) indeed.'%0D%0A%0D%0A'O my son! If it be (anything) equal to the weight of a grain of mustard%0D%0Aseed and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens or in the earth, Allah%0D%0Awill bring it forth. Verily, Allah is rubtle (in bringing out that grain),%0D%0Awell aware (of its place).'%0D%0A%0D%0A'O My son! Aqimis salaat (offer prayers perfectly), enjoin (people) for%0D%0AAl-Ma'roof (Islamic monotheism and all that is good) and forbid from%0D%0Aal-Munkar (disbelief in oneness of Allah - polytheism of jinds and all that%0D%0Ais evil and bad) and bear with patience whatever befalls you. Verily, these%0D%0Aare some of the important commandments ordered by Allah with no exemption.'%0D%0A(Surah Luqmaan)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
