  "answer": "QUESTION\nplease make duaa\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBefore approaching the person in reference, we advise you make Istikhaara\n(seek Divine guidance) as well s make Mashwarah (consult) with reliable\npeople about the person and your intention. If the guidance in the\nIstikhaara and Mashwara are positive, then you may appoint a reliable person\nas your representative to first enquire from the person if he will be\ninterested in marrying or not. If he is interested, then he may suggest you\nto him.\n\nWhile it is permissible for a female to make a proposal, we advise the above\nprocedure of first enquiring and then making an independent suggestion by\nyour representative due to the misconception that females cannot make a\nproposal and is regarded to be incorrect, etc. Should you decide on that\ncourse of action, it is permissible but may not be conducive to your course\ndue to the misconception of our people.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
