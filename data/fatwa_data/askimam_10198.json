The most important aspect in regard to staying away from looking at non-Mahram teachers is to keep the gaze down. Don?t make eye contact. If you have to speak to them, then be to the point. Do not speak in alluring tones. Keep in mind that Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ?The (evil) gaze is a poisonous arrow from the arrows of Iblees. Whoever protects his gaze out of fear for me, I will favour him with such Imaan the sweetness of which he will perceive in his heart.? (Tabrani). Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] also said, ?Modesty is a branch of Imaan.? Include modesty in your personality. Do not be open in your contact with them. In regards to protecting yourself from the evil environment of the university, the most effective weapon is to fear Allah. Keep in mind that my Allah is looking at me. Fortify yourself with this thought that Allah has placed two angels on my shoulder. I should at least control myself whilst I am in the company of the angels. Also before going to sleep, spend sometime thinking of death and the hereafter. This will help greatly in fortifying yourself against the evil environment.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. It is a sin to do this. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has called this the Zina of the heart. The method to eradicate these thoughts is to ignore them. Do not attempt to prevent them from coming or to fight them. You will not overcome them in this way. The only method is to be indifferent to these thoughts, ignore them and engage yourself in some other work preferably Zikr. Also, bear in mind that these thoughts when they come, they only become sinful when one voluntarily invites them or when one builds on them when they come voluntarily.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. a) The husband of your mother?s sister and your father?s sister are Ghayr Mahrams, b) The sons of your husband?s siblings are Ghayr Mahrams, c) Paternal and maternal uncles of your husband are Ghayr Mahrams. Pardah is necessary for all of them. (Ahsanul Fataawa vol.5 pg.72; HM Saeed)%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Your husband?s brother and your cousins, paternal and maternal are also Ghayr Mahrams. (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0A5. If there is no Halaal alternative, or if you are unable to obtain Halaal medication, and there is a dire need for it, then it will be permissible to use Haraam medicine. (Shaami vol.1 pg.210; HM Saeed)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
