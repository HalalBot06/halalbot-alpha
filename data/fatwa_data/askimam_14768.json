  "question": "Isnt it obligatory to give Adhan in the new born baby's ears....",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n Isnt it obligatory to give Adhan in the new born baby's ears? My aunt who recently had a grandchild didnt do so saying that it is only bida'ath and claimed that there are no hadeeses to support this.I know that all babies whether it be of a Jew or a Christian, are born muslims and .....so the practise may not be obligatory. But would it be a bida'ath and wrong by reciting something good and holy for the baby to hear first time??!! If there are any hadeeses supporting the call of Adhan,  i would like to which one in particular? Also pl quote the hadees. Pl clarify my doubt.  \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIt is Sunnah to call out the Azaan in the ears of a new born child.\n\n \n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Rafi (Radiallahu Anhu) that the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) called out the Azaan in the ear of his grandson Hasan Bin Ali (Radiallahu Anhuma) when Sayyidah Faatimah (Radiallahu Anha) gave birth to him.This Hadith is authentic (Saheeh). (Abu Dawood 5105, Tirmizi 1514)\n\n \n\nThe practice of calling out the Azaan in the ears of a new born should be encouraged as this is Sunnah and it will be one of the first words the child hears in this world.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala Knows Best.\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
