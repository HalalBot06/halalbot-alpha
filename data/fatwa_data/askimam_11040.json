Allah Ta?ala states in the Qur?aan, ?Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of the day and night, and the ships which sail through the sea with that which is of us to mankind, and the rain which Allah sends down from the sky and makes the earth alive there with after its death, and the moving creatures of all kinds that he has scattered therein, and in the veering of winds and clouds which are help between the sky and the earth, are indeed proofs for people of understanding.? (2:164)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and in the alternation of night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding. (4:190)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Allah has created every moving creature from water. Of them, there are some that creep on their bellies, some that walk on two legs and some that walk on four. Allah creates what He wills. Verily, Allah is able to do all things. (18:45)%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Allah causes the day and the night to succeed each other. Truly, in these things is indeed a lesson for those who have insight. (18:44)%0D%0A%0D%0A5. And verily in the cattle there is a lesson for you. We give you to drink from that which is in their bellies, from between excretions and blood, pure milk, palatable to the drinkers. (14:66)%0D%0A%0D%0A6. And your Lord inspired the bee saying, Take your habitations in the mountains and in the trees and in what they erect. Then, eat of all fruits, and follow the ways of your Lord made easy (for you). There comes forth from their bellies, a drink of varying colour wherein is healing for men. Verily, in this indeed, a sign for people who think. (14:68)%0D%0A%0D%0A7. Say (O Muhammad ? sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam], ?Tell me, if (all) your water were to be sunk away, who then can supply you with flowing (spring) water?? (68:30)%0D%0A%0D%0A8. Do they not see the birds above them, spreading out their wings and folding them in? None upholds them except the Most Beneficent (Allah). Verily, He is the All-Seer of everything.%0D%0A%0D%0A9. Do they not look at the camels, how they are created? And the heaven, how it is raised? And at the mountains, how they are rooted and fixed firm? And the earth, how it is spread out? (88:17-20)%0D%0A%0D%0A10. Say (O Muhammad ? Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) Tell me, if Allah made night continuous for you till the day of resurrection, who is a god besides Allah who could bring you light? Will you not then hear? Say (O Muhammad) tell me, if Allah made day continuous for you till the day of resurrection, who is a god besides Allah who could bring you night wherein you rest? Will you not then see? (28:71-72)%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the above examples and Aayaats and a multitude of others, a person can clearly see the Omnipresence of Allah and that this whole system of the universe is being run by a superior being.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
