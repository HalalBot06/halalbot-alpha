  "question": "Oral Sex With Husband Who Does Not Secrete mazi? permissible",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nassalamulaikum, My husband does not discharge mazi during sexual activity at all, ever. He appears to be one of the rare casses of men who do not ejeculate pres-seminal fluid. With this in mind, would it be permissible, or at least less makruh than if he did secrete mazi, for a wife to kiss and suck the husband's penis, seeing as there is no danger of the najis of mazi entering her mouth? kindly advise. wassalamualaikum.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
