  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu-Alaikum, Are Veggie burgers made entirely from soy protein and vegetable sources halal. Companies manufacturing these say this is simulated beef but it does not contain any meat or its derivatives. Specifically I am talking of this product: http://www.yvesveggie.com/products_details.php?product_id=41 JazakAllah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the burgers are manufactured entirely from veggies, it will be Halaal.\nHowever, if there are other ingredients / spices mixed into the patty, it\nwill be essential to look into those ingredients as well.\n\nYou may request the manufacturers to forward to you a list of the\ningredients.
