Attached\n\n2. It is accepted that the Qur’aan must be respected. Nobody disputes this. It is also accepted that anything in relation to high, above, etc. is an expression of respect and honour Allah refers refers to Himself as ‘arrahmaanu alal arshistawaa’ (Allah is above His throne). The expression of above is to mark honour and respect. The issue is not only about disrespecting the Qur’aan. It is also about respect. If some don’t regard placing the Qur’aan or the floor as disrespectful, that is, not sufficient. One is required to respect the Qur’aan and that is not achieved by placing the Qur’aan on the ground. The Qur’aan must be accorded respect and placed on a high place.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
