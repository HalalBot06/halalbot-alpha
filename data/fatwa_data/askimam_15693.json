  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy dad use to earn for our family before and that now he has retired (stopped earning). At that time he used to take interest on part of his money.\n\nNow iam the sole earner for our family and i wish not to take it any more as i fear Allah. But the thing is what about the clothes andbelongings i bought with the money that my father used to take interest. i dont even how much of it was taken as interest.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAlhamdulillah, you are earning now. Whenever you have excess money, try and give Sadaqah and make Istighfaar for benefitting from the interest amount.Â \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
