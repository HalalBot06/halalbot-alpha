  "question": "How do I deal with parents that are not as religious as I am and are asking me to do haram things?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have recently started wearing the hijab and my mother is against it and constantly lectures for me to take it off. I try to explain to her its importance, but she just compares me to other girls who do not wear it. She also tells me to talk to guys more and that I should be \"bold\", even my father agrees with her. They think because I am \"too religious\" they will never be able to find me a husband and that I should find one on my own.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Sister-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nAllah ordered us to obey our parents. As Allah states in the Quraan \" And\nAllah has decreed that you worship none but Him and that you be dutiful to\nyour parents\".\n\nHowever one cannot follow ones parents if they are going against the shariah\nof Allah. Also when you are talking to your parents concerning issues you\nneed to use wisdom. Remember if your parents continue to go against the\nShariah you need to be steadfast in what you believe in , but at the same\ntime do not show disrespect to your parents.\n\nAs for getting a husband, this is not based on a woman not wearing hijab;\nMarriage is based on personal choices rather on a specific type of dress.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
