  "answer": "QUESTION\nThere is a hadith that I once read several years ago that says something like this: \"When Allah is pleased with a people, he gives them good rulers, makes the rain come in season, and those in charge of the Exchequer are good hearted. When Allah is displeased with a people, he gives them bad rulers, makes the rain fall out of season, and those in charge of the Exchequer are miserly and mean-spirited.\" Could you please post the hadith, together with who reported it, it's status (sahih or otherwise) and in which collection(s) it is to be found? JazakAllahair for any assistance you can provide\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis narration has been recorded by Imaam Bayhaqi in Shu?ubul Imaan (vol.6 pg.23 Hadith7392) and Imaam Daaraqutni in ?al-Gharaaib?.\n\nThis narration is suitable for quotation. However, it is not a Hadith of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), instead, it is Sayyiduna Umar ibn al-Khattaab (Radhiallaahu Anhu) who has narrated this dialogue between Moosa (alayhis salaam) and Allah Ta?ala, where Moosa (alayhis salaam) asks Almighty Allah as to what are the signs of his pleasure and displeasure with his creation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl.
