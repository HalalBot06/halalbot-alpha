  "question": "Can a person say his fajar namaz before the sun totally rises",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI wanted to ask you about the duration of fajar namaz.Please interpret it according to hanafi madhab that if a a person wakes up at a time when a very slight appearance of reddish colour of sun appears .Can a person say his fajar namaz before the sun totally\nrises.Or what should he do he should wait for the sun to rise and read qaza fajar\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe duration for the Fajr Salaat is from Subh-e-Saadiq, i.e. when a white horizontal line can be seen in the horizon at the time of pre-dawn till the sun begins to rise. According to the Hanafi Madhab, the Fajr Salaat can be performed at anytime between these two points in time. (Aalamgiri vol.2 pg.51; Maktaba Rashidiyyah)\n\nThe Fajr Salaat will be valid if one performs it at the time when the sky is reddish in colour. However, once the sun can be seen rising, it will not be permissible to perform any Salaat. (Ahsanul Fataawa vol.2 pg.130). If one did not read the Fajr Salaat within the abovementioned time limit, he will have to wait till after sunrise and read Qadhaa of the Fajr which he has missed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
