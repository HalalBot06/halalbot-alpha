  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI purchased futuregrowth and oasis shares before the ruling of impermissiblity of shares was announced. I have removed my cash but left the so called profits. Can this money be used to pay taxes, vat and rates. Eg. vat on a motor vehicle purchase.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n Assalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is not permissible to use the dividends (interest) earned from the stock markets to pay taxes, VAT and rates.  \n\nThe money will have to be disposed off in charity without the intention of reward.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
