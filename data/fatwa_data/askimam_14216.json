  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like to know if women can lead namaz when there is only women praying. I keep getting mixed responses whenever I ask someone. Either way, can I have proof from the Quran or the Hadith proving that? Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe Ulama have ruled that for a woman to lead other women in Salaat is Makrooh. This ruling is based on several proofs.\n\n \n\nSayyiduna Abdullah ibn Mas’ood (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ‘The Salaat of a woman in her chamber is better than her Salaat in her room. And her Salaat in her room is better than her Salaat in any other room of her house.’ (Sahih ibn Khuzaymah vol.3 pg.95)\n\n \n\nSayyiduna Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ‘Verily the most beloved Salaat to Allah from among the Salaats that a woman offers, is her Salaat in the most darkest part of her room.’ (Ibid pg.96)\n\n \n\nBased on these Ahaadith, the Ulama have resolved that the Ahaadith which prove its permissibilitiy had either taken place earlier and these Ahaadith that we quote later on obliterated them, or the least that one can derive is that the better option is not to do so. Another reason for which the Ulama regard this to be Makrooh is the fact that she will have to stand in the first Saff and for the Imaam to stand in the first Saff is Makrooh.\n\n \n\nIt should be noted that the impermissibility of a woman leading men is undisputed. The above is in regard to a woman leading other women only.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
