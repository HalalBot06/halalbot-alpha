  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJUMMU'AH GUIDELINES - JADOO %2F SIHR %2F BLACK MAGIC%0D%0A%0D%0AA R A B I C%0D%0ASay, I seek refuge with the Rabb of the Morning from the evil of created things; and from the night when it spreads, and from those who blow into knots (practice secret arts), and from the evil of a jealous person. (Surah al-Falaq; 113)%0D%0A%0D%0AA R A B I C%0D%0ASay, I seek refuge with the Sustainer of mankind, the King of people, Rabb of the people, from he evil of the whisperer who withdraws; he who whispers into the hearts of people; from Jin and human. (Surah An-Naas; 114)%0D%0A%0D%0AA Jew by the name of Labid did black magic on Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam). He took the hair of Rasulullah and made eleven knots into a date and placed in under a rock in the well called Zarwan. The effect of this was that it created uncertainty in the mind of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) as to whether he had done or not done certain things. At times Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) felt he had accomplished something yet he had not done so and vice versa. Jibraaeel (AS) informed Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) as to what had occurred and brought the above mentioned two Surahs. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) together with the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhu) went to the well and removed the knotted hair. As each Aayat was recited, the knots untied miraculously. At the eleventh knot, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) was relieved. (Tafseer Ibn Katheer vol.4 pg.614; Darul Ma'rifah)%0D%0A%0D%0AOne may wonder, how is it that the Prophet of Allah was affected with Jadoo. He had so much of faith in Allah, how could Jadoo affect him?%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Reality of Jadoo%0D%0AJadoo has a natural effect just as the sun has an effect of heat. The Prophets%2FAmbiyaa (alaihimus salaam) felt the heat on hot days, they felt hungry when they didn't eat, similarly they could be affected with Jadoo as well. But this Jadoo did not interrupt their prophethood status nor was it allowed to interfere with the authenticity of their mission.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHIS WORLD - CAUSE%2FEFFECT%0D%0AAlmighty Allah Ta'ala created this entire universe and he has designed its functions according to the cause and effect procedure. Everything has a cause which subsequently has a natural effect. When the sun shines, it is hot, when snow falls it is cold. Heat and cold are the natural effects of the sun and snow. Similarly, if a person is stabbed with a knife, he will bleed. Bleeding is a natural effect of stabbing. If a person is thrown in the center of the sea, he will naturally drown if he cannot swim.%0D%0A%0D%0AOur Belief%0D%0AAlthough this world functions according to the cause%2Feffect procedure but the effect of anything lies in the Will of Allah. If Allah Wills, the effects of causes will exist but, if Allah does not will, then in -spite of the means we adopt, the effects will not exist.%0D%0A%0D%0AIncidents%0D%0A1- Namrood told his people to make a fire to burn Ibraheem ('alaihis salaam). After the fire was lit, due to the flames being very high, Ibraheem ('alaihis salaam) was put on a catapult to be thrown into the fire. Although the effect of the fire is to burn, Ibraheem ('alaihis salaam) did not burn. This was because it was not the Will of Allah for the fire to be effective. (Ibid vol.3 pg.192)%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah told the fire: [ a r a b i c ]%0D%0A\"Oh fire, be cool and peaceful upon Ibraheem.\" (Qur'an 21 V 69)%0D%0A%0D%0A2- A knife has a natural effect of cutting, the cut could also sometimes be fatal. Ibraheem ('alaihis salaam) passed the knife on his son Ismaaeel ('alaihis salaam) but the knife did not show its natural effect because it was not the will of Allah Ta'ala for it to cut. (Tafseer ibn Katheer vol.4 pg.18; Darul Ma'rifah)%0D%0A%0D%0A3- Firoun and his army were drowned in the Red Sea but the same Red Sea did not drown Moosa (alaihis salaam) and his army.%0D%0A%0D%0AAll these incidents clearly indicate that effects of causes are through the Will of Allah Ta'ala. Allah Ta'ala is the One who gives effect to the cause.%0D%0A%0D%0ABlack Magic%0D%0A%0D%0AA R A B I C %0D%0A'And they followed what Shaitaan had recited on the Kingdom of Sulaimaan ('alaihis salaam), and Sulaimaan ('alaihs salaam) did not transgress but the Shaitaans did it by teaching the people Black Magic' (Qur'an 2 V 102)%0D%0A%0D%0ABlack magic was common at the time of Sulaiman (alaihis salaam). The Shaitaan used to teach the people black magic. Allah sent two angels, Haroot and Maaroot, as a test to the people. They taught the people the practice of black magic but warned them that they have been sent as a test from Allah, so the people should not abuse this knowledge. Allah further says:%0D%0A%0D%0AA R A B I C%0D%0A\"They (people practicing black magic) cannot harm anyone but with the Will of Allah\". (Qur'an 2 V 102)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Challenge%0D%0AMoosa (alaihis salaam) and the people practicing witchcraft at the time of Firoun is mentioned in the Qur'an. Moosa (alaihis salaam) was victorious and Allah further says:%0D%0A%0D%0A[ a r a b i c ]%0D%0A\"A witchdoctor%2Fperson practicing black magic does not succeed wherever he goes\" (Qur'an 20 V 69).%0D%0A%0D%0ALabid Ibn A'sam practiced black magic (witchcraft) on Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) and he was affected for about 6 months, until the Surahs of 'An-naas' and 'Al-falaq' were revealed. Thereafter Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) was cured. (Ibid vol.4 pg.614)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above explanation is clear that black magic is a reality and it has its effects but only with the Will of Allah, just as poison has its effects with the Will of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhy do people resort to black magic, Jadoo, etc.?%0D%0A%0D%0AGenerally, people are driven to black magic due to jealousy.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen a person has a flourishing business or popular and holds a distinguishing postion in society, etc. this is not tolerated and accepted by others. People desire that those prosperities be taken away from their brother. This jealousy causes a person to harm his brother. His ultimate purpose is to cool his eyes by witnessing his brother's downfall. Thus he stoops to the despicable and Haraam act of Jadoo to achieve his ambition.%0D%0A%0D%0AJealousy%0D%0AJealousy is an internal sickness, like pride and anger. If it is not cured, the consequences of jealousy are very dangerous to oneself and the society in general. The jealous person is actually objecting to Allah's decree: \"Why did You give him wealth, why did You give him position?. Why haven't I been given this wealth and position?\"%0D%0A%0D%0ASuch a person needs to strengthen his Imaan on Taqdeer. Everything is predestined. When a person is in the womb of his mother, his sustenance, life and position is already written. Everything happens according to the absolute Knowledge of Allah (Taqdeer). Such a person must repeatedly remind himself that he is helpless in determining other peoples' affairs. The affairs of people are controlled by Allah Ta'ala. Ponder upon the Hadith of Jealousy.%0D%0A%0D%0A[ a r a b i c ]%0D%0AHadhrath Abu Huraira (RA) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) said; Beware of jealousy, for jealousy eats up good deeds just as fire eats up (burns) wood (Mishkat 46 pg. 248)%0D%0A%0D%0A[ a r a b i c ]%0D%0AHadhrath Zubair (RA) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) said, 'The sickness of the previous nations will creep into you, i.e. jealousy and hatred. These sicknesses are shavers; I don't say they shave hair but they shave Deen\". (Mishkat 2 Pg. 428)%0D%0A%0D%0AA Jealous person is void of the spirit of Deen. His heart is always filled with enmity and malice. He does not perform any Ibaadat. His wish is to harm others.%0D%0A%0D%0A[ a r a b i c ]%0D%0A%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) asked, \"Do you know who is a pauper?\" The Sahaaba (RA) replied, 'A pauper is he who does not have a Dirham or Dinar (no money) nor has he any wealth'. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) said, \"A pauper in my Ummah is he who comes on the day of Qiyaamat with Salah, Fast, Zakaah But has verbally abused someone, unjustly eaten another person's wealth, hit someone, etc. (for such a person) his good deeds will be taken and given to the other person. If that person's good deeds are finished, then his sins will be laden upon him and will be put in the Hell Fire. (Mishkat 2 pg. 435)%0D%0A%0D%0AA jealous person should ponder upon all these Ahaadith and rid himself of the evil of jealousy. If he does not, then jealousy can make him stoop to low levels, to the level of Jadoo and oppressing his brother. Imagine the grief and anxiety caused through Jadoo. The affected person is oppressed, thus the jealous person is endangering his hereafter. If he only strengthens his Imaan on Taqdeer, he could contain himself.%0D%0A%0D%0AHow to save oneself from Jadoo%0D%0AIf a person is affected by witchcraft, it is Sunnah to cure himself. The method of cure must be carefully chosen. Many people (Muslims and non-Muslims) claim they can cure. But one must choose a person who strictly adheres to the Qur'an and Hadith. One should abstain from going to a non-Muslim. However, in a case of desperation, if no Muslim is found, he may go to such a person who does not utter words of Kufr and Shirk. The person who cures is not any extraordinary person. He is just a Doctor who specializes in a specific field. Just as a Doctor could make a mistake in his diagnosis, the Aamil too can make a mistake. His words cannot be regarded as absolutely correct. Whilst treating, if somebody's name comes out, it is not certain that the person did Jadoo, etc. Similarly, the taweez the Aanmil gives may be used. The Sahaaba asked Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) about Taweez. He said, 'it is a power from the power of Allah' It is a means of cure, but Allah is the ultimate Shafee (Curer).%0D%0A%0D%0AFinally%0D%0AMany people experience some downfall and quickly jump to the conclusion that somebody made Jadoo and start casting doubts on different people. Therefore, one should not be too hasty in concluding that the cause of a problem is Jadoo because more often than not, Jadoo has nothing to do with the problem.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah knows best"
