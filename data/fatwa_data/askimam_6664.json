  "question": "1)If I forget the Dua-Qunoot in the Witr, Is it valid or Sajda Sahw is necessary. 2) Maghrib Salaat. Instead of 3 rakaat he did 4 rakaat. upon realizing this mistake, he repeated Salaat again",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)What if I forget the Dua-Qunoot in the Witr and went to Ruku after the regular Surah and completed my Salaat. Is it valid or Sajda Sahw is necessary. 2) A brother was making his Maghrib Salaat. Instead of 3 rakaat he did 4 rakaat and upon realizing this mistake after Salaat, he repeated Salaat again. But one brother told us that he could have just have done one more rakaat and his salaat would have been valid (like 5 rakaat) 3) We go for 2nd Joula (Ghast) to a locality and Musallah belongs to Afro-American brothers. This brother leads the Salaat. First of all, his Wudhu is doubtful (like his elbows seems always dry after he makes Wudhu) and secondly his Quranic recitation is very bad. Is our Salaat behind him OK or do we have to repeat Salaat again individually (for hikmat purposes / not to hurt him).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If one forgets to read Du'aa-e-Qunoot in the Witr Salaat, then\nSajdah-e-Sahw is necessary.\n2. If the person did not sit after the third Rakaat of Maghrib Salaat, then\nhis Salaat was invalid. If he did sit after three Rakaats and then stood up\nfor the fourth Rakaat, then the person should add another Rakaat in order to\nmake the last two Rakaats Nafl.\n3. If there is a sound reason to the validity of the Imaam's Wudhu then the\nSalaat should be repeated.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
