  "question": "Ulema of today compared to pious predecessors. contemporary Ulema can make better decisions because they have access to more knowledge.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThese days some people say that now Ulema have access to books easily which people before did not have access to. They had to travel far just to get one hadith. Therefore contemporary Ulema can make better decisions because they have access to more knowledge. I know this is incorrect. Please give a detailed answer with reference to reading material.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFirstly, contemporary Ulama make decisions that are all based on the views, explanations and interpretations of their predecessors. Contemporary Ulama are dependent on their predecessors. Yes, nowadays, contemporary Ulama do have easier access to books than before. However, this is only with reference to ?access books?.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs for knowledge and expertise, then this was found to a far greater extent in the earlier times. The earlier scholars sacrificed much more for knowledge and they possessed much more expertise in all fields of knowledge which is why contemporary Ulama are dependent on their interpretations and explanations. Another important aspect is this that our pious predecessors lived closer to the time of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). During the time of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), Deen was complete. It was then passed on generation by generation down till today. Due to the chain of narrators increasing as time went on till today, this to a certain extent decreases the actual quality. On the other hand, secular education changes daily. The more technology progresses, the more deductions man makes. Hence, in technology, contemporary scientists have more exposure and are more capable than previous times.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
