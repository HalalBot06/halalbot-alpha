  "answer": "QUESTION\nAlso are salafis muslim or not and is it a sin to become salafi? Also what is ahle hadith exactly\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, the hands in Fardh Salaat are raised only when commencing Salaat ? while reciting the Takbeer-e-Tahrima. It is incorrect to raise the hands elsewhere in Fardh Salaat.\n\nSalafis are Muslims but they are misled in not making Taqleed (following) of one particular Imaam in Fiqh. Some of their Aqaaid and beliefs are questionable.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
