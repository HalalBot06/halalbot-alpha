  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease describe me the mas' ala regarding the namaaz of a patient to whose body a urinary bag has been connected. It can be through the penis or directly injecting a syringe into the urinary bladder. In both case, the patient will not be able to know whether he has passed urine or not (without looking & noticing the measurement of the bag). Should such a person make wudhu ? or tayammum is enough? or not even that is neccessary? Can he do more than one farz namaaz with a single wudhu?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIf a person does not find sufficient time in the duration of an entire salat time to perform the fard and wajib acts of that salat, then such a person will be regarded as a ma’dhur.\n\nAn easy method to determine whether one is a ma’dhur is by taking the shortest salat time of the day.  Usually Maghrib salat has the shortest time.  During this time, a person should try his utmost to perform the fard and wajib acts of the salat.  If it is not possible for him to pray the salat with purity, then he will be regard as a ma’dhur.  Once a person becomes a ma’dhur, it is not a pre-requisite that impurity must flow throughout the salat times in order to remain a ma’dhur.  If the impurity flows once in the salat time, he will still be considered a ma’dhur.  However, if an entire salat time passes without him experiencing the impurity, then he will no longer remain a ma’dhur.  \n\nOnce it is established that a person is ma’dhur, he will have to make wudu for each salat time.  As long as the salat time remains, his wudu will remain.  However, if his wudu happens to break due to some other factor besides the sickness that classified him as a ma’dhur, he will have to re-perform his wudu.\n\nAl-Bahr al-Ra’iq(1/215) Maktaba Rashidiyya\nAl-Fatawa al-Hindiyya (1/40) Maktaba Rashidiyya\nBahishti Zewar p.74 Maktaba Makiyya\n\nAs regards to a person who has a urinary bag connected through his penis or a syringe directly inserted into his urinary bladder, then one will have to see his condition.  If the flow of urine continues to such extent that he does not find time to pray salat with purity, then he will be considered as a ma’dhur and all its laws will apply.\n\nIf, however, the flow of urine is not of such degree, then he will not be classified as ma’dhur in Shari’a.  He must observe the urinary bag before performing wudu and perform only his fard salat.  After performing the salat, if he finds an increase in the urinary bag, it will imply that his wudu has nullified during the salat and he will have to re-perform his salat.  It might be helpful to note when during the day he usually passes urine into the urinary bag and avoid praying in those times. \n\nA person classified as ma’dhur may perform from a single wudu as many salats he wishes in the salat time.  After the time expires, he will have to perform a fresh wudu.\n\nIf he is not a ma’dhur, then with one wudu he may perform salats as long as his wudu remains.  It will not be necessary to perform a fresh wudu upon the expiring of the time if his wudu did not nullify in any manner.\n\nInshallah, by taking extra precaution, one will be able to pray his five daily salats without much difficulty.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
