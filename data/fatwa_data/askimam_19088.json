  "question": "Is “Salallahu alahy wa sallam” regarded as a Durud?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI know that “Sallallahu Alayhi Wasalaam” is a darud and sometimes I say it as a darud. Recently I was told that it is not a darud. Please kindly give me information regarding this issue.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nThe phrase “ صلى الله عليه وسلم ” is a form of Salah (darud).\n\nWhen the name of Rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) is taken, it is wajib (compulsory) to mention salah (darud) once.  Thereafter, it is mustahabb (desirable) to recite the Salah (darud) every time one says the name of Rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) or hears someone else say his name.\n\nWhen writing, some people abbreviate the words and use “saws” or “saw ” or “صلعم”, as a short form of Salah (darud). This is not enough. One should write the full Salah and Salam (that is: صلى الله عليه وسلمor salallahu alayhi wa sallam).1\n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\n\nSohail Bengali\nChicago, IL (USA)\n\nConcurred by:\n\nMuftī Abrar Mirza\nChicago, IL (USA)\n\n\nUnder the Supervision of Muftī Ebrahim Desai (South Africa)\n\n \n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER – AskImam.org questions\n\nAskImam.org answers issues pertaining to Sharī’ah.
