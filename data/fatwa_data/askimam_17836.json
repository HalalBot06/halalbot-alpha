  "question": "How can we find out the religion of dead woman body?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nHow can we find out the religion of dead woman body?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nIf the religion of a deceased person is unknown, efforts should be made to locate any relatives, friends, members of the deceased person’s community, or anyone else who may have known the person. If the person’s relatives are unknown or the person is unknown to others, then one must look for signs or evidence to determine whether that person is Muslim. If there are no such signs, then one must look at the community they are in, i.e. if the person lived in an area which consists of a vast majority of Muslims. If this is the case then the person will be considered Muslim and should be washed, enshrouded, and buried in a Muslim cemetery according to the laws of Shari’ah.\n\nولو اختلط موتى المسلمين بموتى الكفار يغسلون إن كان المسلمون أكثر وإلا فلا ، ومن لا يدرى أمسلم أم كافر ؟ إن كان عليه سيما المسلمين أو في بقاع ديار الإسلام يغسل وإلا فلا \n\n(Al-Bahrul Raaiq, 2/174, Rashidiyya)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl. Asif Umar,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Concurred by:\n\nMl. Yusuf bin Yaqub\nDarul Iftaa"
