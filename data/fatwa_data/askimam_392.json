  "question": "Fearing hell and loving heaven. Is this Shirk?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nA person states that if you fear hell or love heaven, you have commited shirk by taking these things as gods. Is this correct?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu 'alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nShirk is to ascribe partners to Allah. A person loving Jannah (paradise) and hating Jahannum does not ascribe partners with Allah in doing so. In fact, he is following the order of Allah in doing so.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai."
