  "question": "So much certainty and not give proof",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamu alaykum,I find it quite strange that you answer questions with so much certainty and not give proof for things that you say. some times you give a ayah or so but I am left with fatwas and no proof. why did you say oral sex is destestable and not give proof and so many other questions. How are people suppose to obey Allaah without knowledge. May Allaah bless you for your efforts.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssalaamu Alaykum wa Rahmatullaahi wa Barakaatuhu\n\nPeople ask us to issue rulings based on our knowledge. They do not request substantiations for our rulings. Furthermore, the insight to understand Shari substantiations requires one to exhaust academic studies in Shariah. Often, no knowledge or little knowledge leads to misunderstandings.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti E Desai\nFatwa Dept."
