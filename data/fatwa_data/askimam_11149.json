  "answer": "QUESTION\nA-salaamu Aleykum sisters and brothers firstble i am greeting the best greetiful of Qura'n kariim. Brothers and sisters i live in the United states, i am muslim and i go to school. i saw boy in the school. He is also muslim, his name is Mohamed, i think i love him, please brothers tell me if that is haram of our religion, reply me back, Waslaamu Aleykum warahmatu Allahiwabarakatuh\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe respond with the best greeeting, Wa-Alaykumus-Salaam-Warahmatullahi-Wabarakatuhu.%0D%0A%0D%0AAlhumdullilah it is so refreshing to recieve an e-mail from a young sister. Masha-Allah one applauds you for your keenness and zeal to identify with the truth.May Allah Ta'ala accept this zeal and build your love for Allah and and protect you from sin.%0D%0AYes! dear sister, it is a very delicate and sensitive situation to be in. In the throes of youth, when the hearts emotions develop and feelings of the body awaken, then to be placed into an environment ripe - for a relationship is most certainly a dilemma.%0D%0A%0D%0AFirstly any love outside Nikaah(marriage bond) would be termed as illicit relationship. Such relationship would bring temporary pleasure and long term heart ache, problems and difficulties which also falls into the category of forbidden love-Haraam-it draws the anger and wrath of Allah-which can follow with calamities. However sincere Tauba-repentance with deep hearted tears draws Allah's Mercy, love, kindness and forgiveness with lots of increase in Barakat.%0D%0A%0D%0ABut then what does one do with theses feelings. Is there a way out - Yes! consider this love to be the poisonous arrow of Shaitaan trying to mislead two innocent youth - For youth in the path of Allah will attain the Shadow of His thrown on the Day of Qiyaamat.%0D%0A%0D%0AConsider also this person may not be the correct match. He is also just filled with intestines of filth, and how long will this beauty last? He grows old or bold - or (May Allah protect) if the beloved meets with an accident and his face is burnt and scarred - the beauty is gone.%0D%0A%0D%0AHence remember Divine love-only true love-proven and tested is from the bond of Nikah.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf you are ready for marriage , follow the correct procedures to enjoy the Bliss of marriage.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf not follow the order%2Fcommand of the Quraan i.e LOWER THE GAZE.By passing you may just see a person, but the second gaze is forbidden. Try and practise on this and Insha-Allah you will enjoy the sweetness of Imaan. If you take one step to Allah, He will come ten towards you(something to this effect).%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala make it easy for you to succeed in bothe the worlds.Aameen %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A2SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
