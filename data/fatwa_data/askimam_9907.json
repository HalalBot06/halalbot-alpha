  "answer": "QUESTION\nive read on da mosque board dat one of da sins r da pants below da ankles?from which hadith is this?is it an authentic hadith?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWearing pants below the ankles is one of the major sins.\n\nIt is narrated in Bukhari that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Whatever is below the ankles from the clothes, then it is in the fire, i.e that portion of the leg which is covered by the clothes will be burnt in the fire.?\n\nIn another Hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said that three people, Allah Ta?ala will not look at them with mercy on the day of Qiyaamat, one of them is he who drags his pants below his ankles. Wearing pants or Kurta or any garment below the ankles is not permissible in Salaat and out of Salaat as it is a sign of pride. (Daleelul faaliheen vol.3 pg.66)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
