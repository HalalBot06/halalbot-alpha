  "question": "What happens to Animals after they die?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamoualaikoum Wamarahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\nHave got a very important question that I've not seen in any islamic websites nor any imaam have been talking about this subject and like we say in Islam, a person must always thrive to know the truth behind a particular matter.\n\nActually, it concerns animals.  It's unfortunate, that we muslims, don't know the importance of animals, about feeding them, loving them, especially cats; as we shouldn't forget that the Prophet Mohummud (saw) loved cats.\n\nI know before who killed cats or dogs simply because they were stealing food at their place; damn it, they are not stealing it's because they're hungry!\n\nAn animal I know will testify for you or against you on the da of judgement about whether you treated them well or not.\n\nSo, my question is, as I cannot see it anywhere else, when an animal die, where does it go? What's their thereafter phase? Everything about this aspect I would really appreciate that you can help me with as it is of grave importance and do give me a detailed one as i'll send your explanation to all imaams for them to talk in their krudba as it's an important aspect to.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is pleasant to see your concern for animals. Nabi صلي الله عليه و سلم has mentioned in one hadith that a woman was punished because of a cat which she had kept locked until it died of hunger. She neither fed it nor gave it water to drink, nor did she set it free to eat the insects of the earth.\n\nAfter much study, we could not find any mention of what happens to animals immediately after their death. However, there is mention of animals being resurrected on the Day of Judgment. When mentioning the conditions of the Day of Judgment, Allah Ta’ala said\n\nوَإِذَا الْوُحُوشُ حُشِرَتْ (5(\n\n((And when the wild beasts shall be gathered together))\n\nIn another verse Allah Ta’ala has mentioned\n\n وَمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ فِي الأَرْضِ وَلاَ طَائِرٍ يَطِيرُ بِجَنَاحَيْهِ إِلاَّ أُمَمٌ أَمْثَالُكُم مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِي الكِتَابِ مِن شَيْءٍ ثُمَّ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ يُحْشَرُونَ (38(\n\n((And there is no animal in the earth, nor a bird that flies on its two wings, but (they are) communities like yourselves. We have not neglected anything in the Book. Then to their Lord will they be gathered))\n\nAlso, there is a hadith which mentions that on the day of Qiyamah, animals would be brought to live in order to take recompense. It is narrated in Muslim and Tirmidhi on the authority of Abu Hurairah (radhi Allahu anhu) that Nabi صلي الله عليه و سلم has said\n\n6745 - حدثنا يحيى بن أيوب وقتيبة وابن حجر قالوا حدثنا إسماعيل - يعنون ابن جعفر - عن العلاء عن أبيه عن أبى هريرة أن رسول الله -صلى الله عليه وسلم- قال « لتؤدن الحقوق إلى أهلها يوم القيامة حتى يقاد للشاة الجلحاء من الشاة القرناء ».\n\n((Most definitely you will give back people their rights on the day of Qiyamah (to such an extent) that a sheep which had no horns (and was beaten in the world by a sheep which had horns) will take revenge from the sheep which had horns)) (Narrated by Muslim, Tirmidhi and Adab al mufrad)\n\nFrom the above mentioned quotes it is known that animals will be raised on the day of Qiyamah for recompense. This is the preferred view according to majority of the Scholars (although there are others who interpret the above-mentioned proofs in a different way).\n\n شرح النووي على مسلم - (ج 16 / ص 352 دار المعرفة)\n\n0لتؤدن الحقوق إلى اهلها يوم القيامة حتى يقاد للشاة الجلحاء من الشاة القرناء ) هذا تصريح بحشر البهائم يوم القيامة واعادتها يوم القيامة كما يعاد اهل التكليف من الآدميين وكما يعاد الاطفال والمجانين ومن لم تبلغه دعوة وعلى هذا تظاهرت دلائل القرآن والسنة قال الله تعالى وإذا الوحوش حشرت واذا ورد لفظ الشرع ولم يمنع من اجرائه على ظاهره عقل ولا شرع وجب حمله على ظاهره قال العلماء وليس من شرط الحشر والاعادة   في القيامة المجازاة والعقاب والثواب وأما القصاص من القرناء للجلحاء فليس هو من قصاص التكليف إذلا تكليف عليها بل هو قصاص مقابلة والجلحاء بالمد هي الجماء التي لا قرن لها والله اعلم\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
