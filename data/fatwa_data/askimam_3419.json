  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Sir, I JUST READ THE FOLLOWING. BOTH MY DAUGHTERS WHO ARE PSYCHOLOGISTS WERE EXCEEDINGLY FURIOUS WHEN THEY SHOWED ME THIS . IF YOU HAD THE SLIGHTEST UNDERSTANDING OF THE QUR'AN AND HOW THE ALMIGHTY CREATED AL-INSAN (NOT MAN, NOT WOMAN BUT \"THE HUMAN\"), AND RAISED IT TO A HIGH STATURE YOU WOULD NOT WRITE THIS STUFF. DON'T YOU EVER READ THE QUR'AN? PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE A DETRIMENT TO AL ISLAM. YOU . ARE MAKING US THE LAUGHING STOCK OF OUR ENEMY. CAN ONE BELIEVE THIS NONESENSE? (It is true that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has mentioned that women have less intelligence than men. This is recorded in Bukhari Shareef. WHERE IS IT IN BUKHARI? [...]\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0AWe have taken note of your e-mail. By the grace of Allah we are not offended%0D%0Aby the least. We understand your frame of mind quite well, and are well%0D%0Aaware of the type of mindset you have. We sincerely make du'a that Allah Ta'%0D%0Aala grants you increase in Islamic knowledge and an understanding of the%0D%0ADeen.%0D%0A%0D%0APlease find attached a copy of the text under question. However, I am sure%0D%0Athat this will not solve the matter, for even if we had to present Imaam%0D%0ABukhari's hand-written manuscript it will be of no value to you.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe root of the issue is that you view Islam from a western mindset. Your%0D%0Avalues and principles lie in the kuffaar way of life, hence your apologetic%0D%0Aattitude regarding many of the teachings of Islam. We are all in need of%0D%0Ashedding some pride, which is the cornerstone of western ideology.%0D%0A%0D%0AOne of the principles that you have inherited from the kuffaar is the%0D%0Aequating of inferiority with derogation.%0D%0A%0D%0ATo accept that Allah Ta'ala has created somebody or something inferior to%0D%0Aanother, in no way implies that the inferior person or thing is belittled.%0D%0A%0D%0AThere are various examples of where Allah Ta'ala, in accordance to His%0D%0Awisdom, has created certain people superior than others. This is the right%0D%0Aof Allah Ta'ala and no one may question His Wisdom. His Knowledge is%0D%0Aabsolute and we, as His creation, cannot fathom His Wisdom.%0D%0A%0D%0AConsider that Allah Ta'ala has created:%0D%0A(a) Our Nabi (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) as the most superior of all the%0D%0Aambiyaa (prophets).%0D%0A(b) Hazrat Jibra-eel (alayhis salaam) as the most superior angel.%0D%0A(c) Hazrat Abu Bakr (Radiyallahu anhu) as the most superior companion of our%0D%0ANabi (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0A(d) Makkah as the most superior city.%0D%0A(e) The Qur%E1an the most superior of the Divine Books%0D%0A%0D%0AThese are merely few cases mentioned by way of illustration. If we had the%0D%0Atime, we could have easily produced a few thousand examples.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn all these cases, since a superior exists, the converse must necessarily%0D%0Afollow to be the inferior.%0D%0A%0D%0ACan one claim that by referring to them as inferior, we wish to belittle or%0D%0Aderide them? Do we imply that they are debase and disgraceful? Does it imply%0D%0Athat they are ignominious?%0D%0A%0D%0AIf this was the case it would imply that since Allah Ta'ala has created our%0D%0ANabi (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) as the most superior Nabi, Allah forbid,%0D%0Aall the other Ambiyaa (alayhis salaam) have no value? Does it mean that%0D%0Asince the Qur%E1an is most superior, all other Divine scriptures are merit%0D%0Aless? The same question can be posed regarding the other examples given.%0D%0A%0D%0AOn the one hand, inferiority is no shame, and on the other hand, it is the%0D%0Aprerogative of Allah Ta'ala to grant intellect to whom so ever He wishes to.%0D%0AIf in His Wisdom He granted men more intelligence than women, it is His%0D%0ARight. No one can question Him, nor can we, with our feeble intelligence%0D%0Aclaim, Allah forbid, that it is illogical for Allah Ta'ala to have done so.%0D%0AIt is neither implied that Allah Ta'ala has degraded women, nor made them%0D%0Avalueless.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala has created man and woman for separate roles. He also granted%0D%0Aeach one of the two qualities which are more befitting for their respective%0D%0Aroles, e.g. women are generally more emotional than men in keeping with%0D%0Atheir role of motherhood. In the same light he has granted men more%0D%0Aintelligence than women, in accordance of their role of guardians and%0D%0Aoverseers over women.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou have misinterpreted this to imply that women are un-intelligent and%0D%0Astupid. This is the result of the corrupt basis from which you are viewing%0D%0Athe issue. You have presumed inferiority to mean degradation.%0D%0A%0D%0AAlmost the entire universe is made of inferior beings. We are all in one way%0D%0Aor the other inferior. We do not have to hang our heads in shame for being%0D%0Ainferior. It is the Divine system that He has created us inferior in some%0D%0Arespect or the other. There is therefore no need for women to feel ashamed%0D%0Aof the fact that they have been granted less of one quality than men.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is rational to accept that not all humans are not of equal intelligence.%0D%0AIt therefore follows that some are more intelligent than others are i.e.%0D%0Aothers are inferior in intelligence. Can one claim that others are devoid of%0D%0Aintelligence? Such a claim will certainly be illogical.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe writer hereof has no qualms in accepting that there are many persons%0D%0Amore intelligent than I am. This makes me inferior in intellect. Why should%0D%0AI allow my pride make me feel ashamed of it. Now, I wish to meet a person%0D%0Awho can claim to be the most superior in intellect. Yet pride will prevent%0D%0Amany a person from accepting that they are of inferior intellect, for in%0D%0Atheir feeble minds it implies some type of disgrace.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn brief, inferiority does not imply disgrace.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala grant us all understanding.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
