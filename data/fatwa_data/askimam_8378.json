  "question": "How do we visit the Prophet in Madina? Some people today claim that it is not right to go and visit his blessed grave in Madina,",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nCould you please let me know how to visit sayyidina Prophet SalAllahu alaihi wa sallam in Madina? Some people today, the salafi group, claim that it is not right to go and visit his blessed grave in Madina, they cite ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Abdul Wahhab. I intend to go make 'Umra, I would like to know how to visit his grave, Rawdha, if it is permissible? If it is, in what manner do the Ulama advise us to? Is the Prophet present in his grave? They also say that you should not face the grave, is it disrespectful to have back to the Holy Prophet's grave? Please give advice and answer, so that I may be able to best spiritually benefit from Umra.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazaakumullah for your query.%0D%0A%0D%0AAll the four Madhaahib agree that the visiting of the tomb of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is Mustahabb. %0D%0A%0D%0AIf you have time to visit Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) before going for Umrah, you may do so, otherwise you may do so after Umrah.%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is alive in his grave and when someone send him slaams, he replies to it. Allah brings back his Rooh and give him his speech to reply the salaam.%0D%0A%0D%0AMullah Ali Qaari (RA), the famous Aalim and Muhaddith has written that besides a few (that are not authoritative and hold a different view), the consensus of the Muslims is that to visit Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is an important act of piety. Some Ulama have said that it is Waajib (obligatory) upon that person who has the means to reach there. Allaamah Shaami (RA) relates this same view from ibn Hajar (RA). To avoid going for Ziyaarat is sheer negligence and carelessness.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn view of certain Ahaadith, some Ulama have said that the intention made for this journey must be to visit the Musjid-an-Nabawiy and not the grave of Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). The consensus of the four Madhaahib is that it is Mustahabb to visit the grave of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Imaam Nawawiy (RA), the famous Shaafi?ee scholar, writes in his book on Hajj, ?When Hajj has been performed then with the intention of Ziyaarat of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)?s tomb, one should proceed to Madeenah.? Obviously, to travel to Madeenah will also be Mustahabb.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) relates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Whoever visists my grave, my intercession becomes obligatory for him.? (Bazzaar; Darqutni)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) has related that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?The person who performs Hajj, then visits my grave, is like he who has visited me during my lifetime.?%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) relates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Whosoever visists me and has no other motive, has a right over me that I intercede on his behalf.? (Tabrani)%0D%0A%0D%0ATo visit Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)?s Musjid and to pray, to read Qur?aan and perform Salaat are of great acts of Ibaadat. To go personally to Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)?s grave and reciting this, ?Assalaatu wassalaamu alayka yaa rasoolullah? is sufficient as a visitor. Paying homage to him has already been accomplished. There is a lot of other ways you can make salaam to him and other Du?aas also. To face Nabi?s (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) grave and make Du?aa is not recommended due to the fact that other observers or ignorant worshippers may think that one is asking Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) something or worshipping him. So, to avoid confusion, it is better to face the Qiblah and make Du?aa to Allah for Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Note that no noise, shouting and loud voices be heard when making salaam to him. The voice must be in such a way that it can reach the room. Asking for Waseelah (intercession) is very important and one should beg Allah for Nabi?s (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) intercession. Although Du?aa should be made by facing the Qiblah, it will disrespectful to face one?s back to Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). So, it is better to face him and make Du?aa avoiding lifting of the hand. Finally, after greeting Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), move a little forward and greet Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) and little further greet Hadhrat Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu).%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
