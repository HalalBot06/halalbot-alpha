  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1.Can you make thikr or du-aa with your eyes closed all the time untill you done .\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is permissible to close one’s eyes whilst making dhikr or du‘ā. Closing one’s eyes is very effective in facilitating better concentration. However, one should not deem it as part of some special act of worship. Furthermore, it should not be done with such incessancy and constancy that the person himself or other people begin to deem it as an independent form of worship.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\nMl. Yusuf bin Yaqub,\nStudent Darul Iftaa"
