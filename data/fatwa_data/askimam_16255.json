I feel very frightened, what should I do.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nHadhrat Aishah (R.A) relates that whenever a strong wind bringing dense clouds started blowing, the prophet’s (salallahu alayhiwasallam) face turned pale with the fear of Allah. He became restive and would go in and out, and would recite the following dua:\n\n \n\nاللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ خَيْرَهَا وَخَيْرَ مَا فِيهَا وَخَيْرَ مَا أُرْسِلَتْ بِهِ وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّهَا وَشَرِّ مَا فِيهَا وَشَرِّ مَا أُرْسِلَتْ بِهِ\n\n \n\n     “O, my Allah! I ask of thee the good out of this wind, the good out of that which is in this wind, and the good out of that which is the outcome of this wind. I seek refuge in thee from the evil of this wind, from the evil out of that which is in this wind, and from the evil out of that which is the outcome of this wind.”\n\n(faza’il-e-a’maal pg.36,Ch. Fear of Allah)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai (F3)"
