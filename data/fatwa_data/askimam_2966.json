  "question": "Is it permissable to eat in resturants? Can we eat food prepared by Non-Muslims? Can we eat onlyin veg only resturants?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nTayyibaat refers to that food which is pure (Halaal) beyond doubt.\nTherefore, precaution should be exercised in determining which food is\nHalaal beyond doubt. It is not sufficient to rely on the Halaal signs\nadvertised on windows of food outlets as many people use the sign only for\ncommercial purposes.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
