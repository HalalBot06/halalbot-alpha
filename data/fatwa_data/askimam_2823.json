  "question": "A dream interpretation",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI had a dream last night that I went to a hospital because I wanted to ask the doctor why I was having occasional bladder infections. He told me that they had to operate on me towards the bladder, but he pointed on my left side. I left his office telling him that I would but that I would come back. Then I ended up going to another doctor who told me that something was wrong with my ovaries and that they would have to operate on both of them, cutting below the abdomen region horizontaly. But this would prevent me from having children. I began to cry in my dream and didn't tell anyone about it. I think my mom already knew. I am not married yet, & almost 21 yrs old, please tell me what this dream means. Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream has no significance.\n\nYou should simply ignore the dream.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
