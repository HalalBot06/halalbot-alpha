  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. is the discharge that comes from the front passage paak? i.e does a lady have to change all her clothes that are stained each time she discharges?\n\n2.I'v veen married for 3 years and have been trying for children. Recently it was diagnosed that my husbands sperm count is low. is there any dua that can be read to improve it?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAny discharge from within the body is considered impure. If the discharge soils the clothes to the amount of 3cm or more, it will be necessary to wash the soiled part to perform Salaah. It is not necessary to wash the entire garment. To avoid the discharge soiling the clothes, one could use liners etc. Then one would have to remove the soiled liner and perform Salaah. There would then no need to wash the clothes or undergarment.\n\nYou may recite \"Rabbi La Tazarni Fardan Wa Anta Khairul Raziqeen\". Inshallah, Allah will bless you with pious offspring.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai\nStudent: Darul Ifta\n\nChecked and Approved: Mufti Emraan Vawda"
