  "question": "If one's mother dies and she is not a Muslim, is it permissible toattend her burial?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Fuqahaa (jurists) have ruled that if a non-Muslim passes away and there\nis no one to attend to the burial proceedings besides a Muslim relative,\nthen the Muslim relative will be excused for this attendance.\n\nHence, if there are people to attend to the burial proceedings, then there\nis no excuse for the Muslim relative to attend. However, due to\ncircumstances, there could be an exemption to the prohibition.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
