  "question": "My mother put together a mixture of Dutch medicines and asked my wife.......",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy mother put together a mixture of Dutch medicines and asked my wife to drink a little very day.  She says it makes the baby strong.After the baby's born, she intends using them to rub the baby after every bath.  She says it calms the baby and helps it sleep better.My mother also treats us with Dutch medicines whenever we're sick.  She's old fashioned and Dutch medicines are among her first choice home remedies.I've always been pro Dutch medicine because I found them to be more effective than other medicine.Recently someone informed me that it contains 95% alcohol.  Now I'm concerned.  Are we allowed to use them?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIf Dutch medicines do contain alcohol, then it could be used only if a physician prescribes it, there is a need and there is no adequate alternate to that medicine and sickness. If any of those conditions are not fulfilled, then it will not be permissible to use any medicine that contains alcohol. To drink such medicine during pregnancy to make the baby strong and to rub the baby after birth with such medicines does not fall in the category of need and necessity and therefore not permissible to use.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
