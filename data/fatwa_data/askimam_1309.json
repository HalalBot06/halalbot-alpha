  "question": "Is there any basis to the claim that the Quran consists of elaborate mathematical structures.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nExamples of mathematical structures is for example the theory by the 'Kafer' Rashad Khalifa that all the Quran is structured around multiples of the number 19. Or other theories I heard are that many of the opposite meaning words in the Quran (like Jenna and Nar, good and evil, mo2menoon and kafereen, etc...) occur in the same number of words in the Quran. i.e. is there a proven mathematical pattern or structure which stands out as a major part of the miracle of the Quran.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRashaad Khalifa?s claim is baseless.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
