  "question": "how is it that the prayers/requests of a human being caused Allah to change the rules that He had made for the whole of mankind",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nit has been narrated that Prophet Muhammad pbuh begged to Allah SWT for rain in the instance of a drought and Allah granted his prayers such that it rained continously for 5 days followed by a famine;after which the Prophet begged Allah to allow the rain \"not to fall on us but on the trees atop hills\".Followed by that the rain stopped .It is commonly believed by Muslims that Allah commanded his bande (people) to fast all the 12 months of the year and offer 50 prayers everyday. When Mohammed the Prophet and Messenger of Allah EXPLAINED that man had to earn his livelihood and could not possibly do that, Allah relented and commanded His believers to fast at least for a month (that is during the month of Ramadaan) and pray five times a day. This was joyously accepted and hence the celebration at the end of the days of fasting. If verily Allah knows what is good for us and He has also said that He will never put us through unbearable pain and thatHIS signs are perfect and His plans are the best then how is it that the prayers/requests of a human being caused Allah to change the rules that He had made for the whole of mankind,since Allahs' orders/plans should and would hold good if Allah wants it that way since He is the Best Plotter andthe Best Planner.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe request of the human being did not cause Allah Ta?ala to change the rules. It was destined to happen even if there was no such request.\n\nWhere the Salaat was reduced from 50 to 5, etc. this was bound to happen. This reduction was merely to expose the favour and mercy of Allah Ta?ala upon His servants and is no indication of poor planning.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
