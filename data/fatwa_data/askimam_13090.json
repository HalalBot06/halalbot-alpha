  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu'alaykum Mufti Saheb, this morning, during Fajr salaah, I unintentionally burped while in sajda and some water came up. It only came up to the throat but did not reach the mouth. As I was in sajda at the time, due to the small amount and the fact that it had not entered my mouth, I swallowed it again so as not to release it onto the masjid floor. Has my fast been invalidated and, if so, what do I need to rectify it? Jazaak Allah for your help.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSince it did not reach the mouth, your fast is not broken. (Tahtaawi pg.558)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
