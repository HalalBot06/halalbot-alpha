It is not your parent?s responsibility to maintain you. You should maintain yourself. As a husband, it is your obligation to support and maintain your wife. If your parents have offered to assist you, that is their kind gesture.\n\nYou state your parents are in financial difficulty. If they cannot assist you, you cannot hold them responsible. Be thankful to them for whatever assistance they have rendered. You should search for means of livelihood and support yourself and your wife. You state that you made intention that Allah will provide for you. Allah did provide for you through your parents before, He is still the Provider and will do so through other means. Place your trust in Allah and adopt the means.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
