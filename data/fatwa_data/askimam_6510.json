  "answer": "QUESTION\nSomeone passed away leaving three daughters and one son..the deceased had four appartments...he gave one to each son/daughter (mentioned in the will), first of all can this be done? or daughters will only get half of what the sons get? b) if one of the daughter dies......how will her appartment be distributed? this daughter has no children ... will her husband, sisters and brothers get anything? c) If these three daughters and sons have any children..will the children get anything? (from their grandfather's wealth)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, it must be pointed out that the heirs of an Estate may only%0D%0Abe determined upon one's demise.%0D%0A%0D%0AAccording to the Islamic Law of Succession and Inheritance, distribution of%0D%0Aan Estate will only commence after funeral expenses, debts and bequests (if%0D%0Aany) made to non-heirs - which will not exceed one-third (1%2F3) of the Estate%0D%0Aafter debts and funeral expenses - have been settled. Thereafter, all assets%0D%0Aform part of the Net Estate and will have to be distributed according to the%0D%0AIslamic Law of Succession and Inheritance.%0D%0A%0D%0A1. The nett Estate will be divided into 48 equal shares and distributed as%0D%0Afollows: Father receives 8 shares, Mother receives 8 shares, Wife receives 6%0D%0Ashares, Each son receives 13 shares. The brother and sisters will not%0D%0Ainherit.%0D%0A2. It is Mustahabb (preferable) to leave a will. (Mirqaat vol.6 pg.180).%0D%0AHowever, it is necessary to leave a will if one owes someone some right.%0D%0A3. In principle, the heirs are the sole owners of their respective shares.%0D%0ATherefore, they may do whatever they wish. They may give it to another heir%0D%0Aor even give the money to charity.%0D%0A4. It is our humble opinion to reduce such an agreement to writing to avoid%0D%0Asour relationships later. In principle, once a person forfeits his%2Fher%0D%0Aright, he%2Fshe cannot reclaim it.%0D%0A5. Once a person passes away, all his possessions belong to all the heirs.%0D%0ATherefore, none of the heirs may give away any belonging of the deceased%0D%0Aexcept with prior mutual consent of all major heirs. If any heir did not%0D%0Atake consent of any heir he%2Fshe shall be responsible for the item.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
