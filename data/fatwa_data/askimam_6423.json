  "answer": "QUESTION\nI went to Hajj this year and prayed sincerely for a husband. I then received a marriage proposal from someone earnestly seeking a wife. We are both enormously attracted to each other but if we consider education, salaries, etc., we are not compatible whatsoever. We have differing views on religion as well. Should we persue this?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSince there is incompatibility regarding Deeni issues, our advise would be to simply let the opportunity go and continue making Du'aa.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
