  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWe know that when a person misses his/her salaat one has to make Qadha.\n\nIs there any specific daleel from Qur’an and Hadith that we can give to those who say that there is No such thing as Qadha Salaat.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nIt is narrated in Sunan Ibn Maaja , hadeeth #697:\n\n\nAbu Hurairah (radiallahu anhu) related that when the messenger of Allah returned from Khaybar with his companions, on the way they went to sleep. They appointed Hadhrat Bilal (radiallahu anhu) to awake them at the time of Can't, but sleep overcame him as well. The prophet (salallahu alayhi wassalam) and his companions woke up after the time of Fajr had finished so the prophet (salallahu alayhi wassalam) ordered the sahabah to make the rows, and then they performed their qadhaa salaah.\n\n \n\nThen the prophet (salallahu alayhi wasallam) said:\n\nﻣﻦ ﻧﺴﻲ ﺻﻠﺎﺓﻓﻠﻴﺼﻠﻬﺎ ﺍﺫﺍ ﺫﻛﺮﻫﺎ  \n(Whoever forgets their salah, they should pray it when they remember).\n\nWe understand from this that a person has to do qadha of his missed salaah.\n\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
