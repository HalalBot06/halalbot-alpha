  "question": "Is OK for a hanafi to marry a Shafi. Also I have put in a proposal for a girl I wish to marry and am awaiting a reply, is there a dua that I can read to inshallah get a positive response.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for a Hanafi to marry a Shaafi?ee or adherent of any Madhab (school of thought) from the Ahlus sunnah Wal Jamaa).\n\nYou should make Du?aa to Allah to grant you that response which is best for you in the absolute knowledge of Allah. Our knowledge is limited and our choices are based on our understanding. Often, we make wrong choices thinking them to be the perfect choice for us.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
