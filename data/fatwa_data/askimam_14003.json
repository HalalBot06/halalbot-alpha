  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have recently been reading alot about the history of Islam and i am rather concerned about the age of Aisha (R.A) at the time of her marriage to Muhammad (S.A.W.) Some sources suggest that she was six and others suggest that she was a teenager.\n\nCan you please clarify for me what age she was?\n\nIf she was of a young age i keepÂ having bad thoughts of child abuse and paedophilia, how can i stop having these thoughts?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nHadhrat Aaisha [radhiallaahu anhu] was six years old when she was married to Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and was 9 when the marriage was consummated. The doubts about child abuse and paedophilia are merely the ideologies of the Kuffaar missioneries and part of their efforts in dishonouring our beloved Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. One should not allow themselves to be indocrinated by such Kuffaar whose primary goal is to poison the minds of people, thus creating an aversion to our beautiful and perfect religion of Islam.\n\nIn the time of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], it was perfectly normal for girls to get married at the age of puberty. We also find that it was a norm in all semitic cultures from the Israelities to the Arabs and all nations in between. According to some books of the Jews, it is preferable for a woman to be married when she has her first menstruation cycle. In another holy jewish book, there are rules regarding sexual intercourse with girls who have not yet menstruated. Throughout history, puberty has always been a symbol of adulthood. Furthermore, there are no records of any objections to the marriage of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] to Hadhrat Aaisha [radhiallaahu anha]. Neither his contemporaries (friends or enemies) had ever criticised him for this. It is extremely unfair for us to judge Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] by the standards set by people of today. Another important point is that in certain countries like Japan and Spain, the age of sexual consent is 13 and 12 respectively. In the US, men who have sexual intercourse with these women will be termed as paedophile, yet it is perfectly normal in their own countries. Would it be correct for the US to label the Japanese and Chinese as paedophiles according to the US standards. These are all standards set by the western world. Shall we judge our beloved Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] by the standards set by the western world of today or by the standards that were set in his own time. It is also a proven fact that in those countries which have a hot climate, people mature faster. This further elaborates on the maturity of Hadhrat Aaisha [radhiallaahu anha] since the Arabian peninsula has a very hot climate.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
