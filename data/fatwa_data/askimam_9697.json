  "question": "One of my parents work in a place where it is haram to work, would it be assisting in a sin if I drive the parent to job and bring them back home?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nwhere it is haram to work, i.e. in a fast food restaurant where haram meat is sold. So my question is would it also be a sin to drive that person to the job place and pick them up and drive them back home? I ask this because I was going to start driving a car inshallah and if my parent asks me to drive them to work, do I have to say no. Or would it be assisting in a sin if I drive the parent to job and bring them back home? (The parent knows it is haram to work there and is looking for an alternative job, but without success). Should I simply not get a car and not drive at all then? Please reply as I am confused whether or not to start driving only because of this issue\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou state that your parent is searching for an alternate employment but is unsuccessful. In principle, if a person has to support himself and his dependants and has no source of income, he will be excused for working in an avenue that is unacceptable until he finds an alternate employment acceptable in the Shari?ah. It is appropriate for you to drive your parent to job and back.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
