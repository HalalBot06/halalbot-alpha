  "question": "Why am i not married at age 23?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have rejected many good proposals as i did not like the boys, my mother always says that because i do this so often i may end up being old and alone. I don't know why i dont like any boy. Please explain if possible.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala has already preordained the events and happenings in a persons\nlife. In regard to your time of marriage, that too has been preordained,\ntherefore one should not become despondent and loose hope in the mercy of\nAllah. You need to take assessment of yourself, and ask yourself what\nqualities you are looking for in a prospective husband as \"you have regected\nmany good proposals\" (in your words). If you had rejected these proposals\nbecause the boys were not Islamically inclined, then you were correct in\ndeclining their offer, if for any worldly reason you had declined, then your\ndelay in marriage is a doing of your own. Always perform Salaatul\nIstikhaarah prior to accepting or rejecting a marriage proposal. May Allah\nTa'ala grant you and all the Muslim maidens suitable pious husbands. Ameen\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
