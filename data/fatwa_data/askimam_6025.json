  "question": "what importance does birthdays have in Islam?And how do we celebrate?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs Salaam Alai Kum, Respected Mufti Saheb, I heard that Islam does not permit us to celebrate birthdays.So one of my cousin doesn't celebrate his birthday or his wife's birthday or his only two year old daughter's birthday and when I wish him on the respective days,he tells me that Islam do not want us to celebrate birthdays and he gives me a lecture about it and tells me that it is a westernized culture or a worldly thing.But when I told one my friend about it she told me that,wishing is not prohibited in Islam neither does Islam say not to wish anyone on their happy day(birthday,wedding anniversary),she said there is nothing wrong in wishing and no where in Islam it says not to wish people.I have a question that is it in Islam to celebrate birthdays and if not can we just wish atleast.I am confused and want to know what does Islam according to Quran and Hadith say about birthdays.Can you please provide me with any authentic support if there is any from Quran or Hadith.May Allah reward you for this,Jazakhalla khairun.Wasalaam Alai Kum.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nCELEBRATING BIRTHDAYS%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is not necessary that everything the West does is according to logic. The%0D%0Abiggest proof that it is the invention of the west are the song words%0D%0Awithout which this function is not complete viz. 'Happy birthday to you.' No%0D%0Aone says, 'Happy birthday celebration' or 'Happy Blessed birthday' or any%0D%0Aother words of this kind. This disease of celebrating birthdays was never%0D%0Aprevalent among Muslims before, but since Muslims started living alongside%0D%0Athe non-Muslims, they have been influenced by them. Birthdays are celebrated%0D%0Ausually at the end of a year and not at the beginning of the year. For%0D%0Aexample, if one's birth date is on the 1st of January, then the birthday%0D%0Awill be celebrated on the 1st of January and not the 2nd of January. Now%0D%0Ajust ponder, what intelligence is there in celebrating and showing happiness%0D%0Awhen a year has decreased in one's life.%0D%0A%0D%0ADuring a birthday celebration, candles are lit on a cake, amounting to the%0D%0Ayears of the one's life. He extinguishes these candles by blowing them out%0D%0Aand all present clap their hands. Hands are clapped at two occasions only,%0D%0Aone at the time of joy for some achievement of his. Secondly, when someone%0D%0Aacts foolishly, then to mock at him. Here a person is extinguishing the rays%0D%0Aof the years of his life by blowing them out himself. Then this is no%0D%0Ahappiness, nor is it any achievement. So the clapping of hands is only for%0D%0Amocking at this person's stupidity. Ponder that this is a custom and sign of%0D%0Anon-believers. When it is someone's birthday, one year of his life has%0D%0Adecreased, and not increased.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis world is a field to work for the hereafter. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%E6#129;layhi Wasallam)'s Ummah has been sent in this world for a very great%0D%0Aobject. The example of this world is like a king who send a few people into%0D%0Ahis treasure room saying that shortly he will send them out, so at that time%0D%0Awhatever they will be possessing will be their property. Inside the treasure%0D%0Aroom, on one side there are heaps of gold and silver, on another side are%0D%0Alying pearls and jewels, then at another place in the room, delicious food%0D%0Aand soft beds are arranged. Now some people think that the king may send%0D%0Athem out any minute. They quickly gather the gold, silver, pearls and gems.%0D%0AThey feel they will go out from there and organise the food and beds for%0D%0Athemselves afterwards. There is another group of people who think that they%0D%0Ahave just arrived. They feel, 'Let us enjoy the food, then lay down to rest.%0D%0AAfter that we will take from the treasures. There is ample time.' So they%0D%0Aeat, sleep and pass their valuable time without taking from the treasures.%0D%0ASuddenly the king sends everyone out. Now those who had collected the%0D%0Avaluables can enjoy their lives eating and sleeping while those that wasted%0D%0Atheir time and did not accumulate anything will begin to regret. Every%0D%0Amoment of this worldly life is very valuable. Here we have to earn for the%0D%0Along and everlasting life of the hereafter. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%E6#129;layhi Wasallam) has said that after entering into Jannat, the people%0D%0Aof Jannat will not be sorry about anything of this world, except for that%0D%0Amoment which was spent without the remembrance of Allah. It is apparent that%0D%0Awhen reward will be granted for remembrance of Allah in this world which is%0D%0Aan abode of actions, then one must surely feel very regretful, that if they%0D%0Ashould have spent more time in the remembrance of Allah, they could be%0D%0Aworthy of more rewards.%0D%0A%0D%0AHafiz Zain Siqti asked Hafiz Jurjani the reason for swallowing dry flour to%0D%0Awhich he replied that when he compared the time of swallowing dry flour and%0D%0Achewing roti then, in chewing so much time is spent in which say 70 times%0D%0ASubhanalla can be uttered. Therefore he left eating roti for the last 40%0D%0Ayears.%0D%0A%0D%0AHow can it be permissible to waste time by celebrating birthdays and%0D%0Abecoming happy that a big slice of one's life is put behind. This world is a%0D%0Aprison for the believer and a Jannat for the disbeliever. Allah has bought%0D%0Athe life and wealth of the believers for Jannat. This life is a trust of%0D%0AAllah by us. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %E6#129;layhi Wasallam) said, 'A person%0D%0Awill not be able to move from his place, until he does not reply to five%0D%0Aquestions:%0D%0A* How did you spend your life?%0D%0A* How did you spend your youth?%0D%0A* Where did you earn your wealth from?%0D%0A* Where did you spend your wealth?%0D%0A* How much did you act upon your knowledge?%0D%0A%0D%0AA person who is concerned of replying to these questions, how can he show%0D%0Ahappiness upon the years of his life decreasing? Besides all this, Islam%0D%0Adoes not permit waste. This is the reason that the poor of this Ummat will%0D%0Aenter Jannat 500 years before the wealthy, because the wealthy will be%0D%0Adelayed by giving an account of their wealth. By spending on birthday%0D%0Aparties, there is no benefit to Islam nor to the poor. It is stated in a%0D%0AHadith the worst Walima feast is the one in which the poor and destitute are%0D%0Aleft out and the wealthy are only invited. Another object of the birthday%0D%0Aparties is show. Islam encourages simplicity. By this attitude of show, the%0D%0Apoor feel inferior and deprived and the rich have a superiority complex.%0D%0AAlso, in these gatherings, music, singing, video filming and the taking of%0D%0Aphotographs and other un-Islamic and forbidden acts take place. May Allah%0D%0ATa%E3la guide us and protect us from all these evils.%0D%0A%0D%0ABy Moulana Abdul Hamid Ishaq%0D%0APrincipal - Madrasah Arabia Islamia, Azaadville%0D%0AEdited"
