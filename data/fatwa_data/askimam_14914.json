  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nQ1. How can I find qibla irection using the sun?\n\nQ2. Is making dua collectively a bida?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1) The question is not clear. Nonetheless we shall answer based on what we understand from your question.\n\nDetermination of the Qibla direction could have two meanings.\n\nIf, for example, the direction of Qiblah is north, then at sunrise till midday, if one faces the coast (direction of sunrise),then the left will be the north.After midday if one faces the west (direction of sunset)then the right will be the North and direction of the Qibla.This procedure could be applied to determine any Qibla direction.\nIt could also be that you wish to determine the qibla direction from scratch. That is, either you do not know the direction or you wish to confirm whether the known direction is indeed the correct one. In this case we recommend the following method presented by Khalid Shawkat on his website www.moonsighting.com :  \nAccurate Method to deduce the Qibla Direction from the sun (without the use of any instruments)\n\nIt is not advisable to determine Qibla using compass specially for Orienting Masajid. The following method which uses the sun is more reliable. It has been observed for centuries and reported in many books by Muslims around the world that two times a year the sun comes overhead above Ka'bah. This is observational fact for centuries, and is used to set the correct Qibla direction in places far from Makkah by Muslims for last so many centuries. Those two dates and times are:\n\nMay 28 at 9:18UT\nJuly 16 at 9:27UT\n\nWhen you observe the sun at these times (after converting it to your local time), you will be facing the Ka'bah giving you Qibla direction, because if there were a very high minaret over Ka'bah reaching up to the sky, then you will see it just like you are seeing the sun. Now, let us take a few examples. If you are in Islamabad, Pakistan ( 5 hours time difference from Greenwich), the local time to observe the sun would be 2:18pm on May 28, and 2:27pm on July 16.\n\nSimilarly, if you are in Nova Scotia, (-3 hours time difference from Greenwich), the local time to observe the sun would be 6:18am on May 28, and 6:27am on July 16.\n\nIf you are at a location that you cannot see the sun on the above mentioned two dates, then you can locate Qibla from the sun when it comes overhead at a point diametrically opposite of Makkah on the globe and look for the following two dates and times:\n\nNovember 28 at 21:09UT\nJanuary 16 at 21:29UT\n\nFace toward the shadow from the sun at these times (after converting it to local time) and you will be facing Ka'bah. If you can see the sun but cannot see the shadow, put your back towards the sun and your face will be towards Qibla.\n\n 2)It is permissible to make Dua in any way, independently or collectively.To make Dua collectively is no Bid’ah.\n\n \nThere are many acts of Bid’ah.It is not possible to enumerate all the acts of Bid’ah.The principle to determine an act of Bid’ah is to practice on any innovation or new act in Deen and regard it as compulsory in Deen.An example of a commonly practiced Bid’ah is to gather people after three days or seven days or forty days after the death of a person to recite the Qur’an.This is regarded to be an act of Ibadah and part of deen.To recite the Qur’an is an act of great virtue and reward.However to gather people on specific days and recite the Qur’an is an act of Bid’ah.\n\n \nBid’ah is condemned as it leads to distorting the Shariah.To condemn Bid’ah an stay away from it is vital to maintain the purity of Deen and Islam.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
