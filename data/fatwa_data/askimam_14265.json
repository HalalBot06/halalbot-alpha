  "question": "Can you drink or eat from a cup or plate that is chipped or slightly broken?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan you drink or eat from a cup or plate that is chipped or slightly broken?\n\nCan we buy things from jewish owned companies such as Marks and spencers, sainsbury etc or should we try and avoid it?\n\nis there a dua that I can read to help get pregnant?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. One should refrain from using the actual place of the chipped utensil. (al-Durar al-Mubaaha fil Hazri wal Ibaahah pg.36; Damascus). The unchipped portion of the utensil may be used.\n\n2. It will be of greater benefit to purchase items from Muslim owned companies. However, if no alternative exists, one may purchase items from companies owned by non-Muslims.\n\n3. ‘Rabb laa tadhayniy fardan, wa anta khayrul waaritheen’ should be read excessively. Similarly, one should make a lot of Istighfaar.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
