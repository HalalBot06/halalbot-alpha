  "answer": "QUESTION\nI love a girl age 25 and she also loves me. we decided to marry in a couple of months , but due to parents she was not allowed to marry me and she was married off to another guy. She did not have sleep with him as yet ( because she stays at her parents home and will go to her husband home after 3 months ( some bidaayee rasum). She love me more and even slepts with me after her marriage.....\n\nMy question is , Is  her nikah still valid after having slept with me. I want to marry her. Please advise\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nIf the girl in reference married someone else, it was wrong of you to have any contact with her. She belongs to her husband. By sleeping with her, you committed a major sin of adultery which is punishable by stoning for a married person in an Islamic State.\n\nYou should have resisted and explained to the girl also to resist. Having love for each other is no excuse to commit adultery. You should have distanced yourself from her to allow her marriage to gel and get settled.\n\n\nMake taubah and make a firm intention never to commit the sin of Zinā again. Her marriage is still intact. Sleeping with her does not invalidate the Nikah. She is someone else’s wife. You have no right over her. If you truly love her, you will wish well for her and hope a prosperous marriage for her. Your contact with her is an obstacle for a successful marriage. You are causing harm to her and if you don’t step back, you will be selfish. Love for her doesn’t mean you have to be physical with her.\n\nIf you keep away, that “love” will fade and die. Look for yourself another girl to marry and convert your harām love to halāl love by marrying her. That will invoke Allah’s mercy and put barakah in your life. Zinā deprives one of Allah’s mercy and barakah.\n\n \nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n \nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
