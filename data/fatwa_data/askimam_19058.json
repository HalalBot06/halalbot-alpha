  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs hajj fard on a woman who does not earn and her husband does not wish to spend on her hajj? Is hajj fard on a woman who has small kids?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nIf you possess sufficient wealth (savings, jewelry, property, etc) that would pay for your trip to Makkah and back for yourself and your mahram, then Hajj is obligatory for you.1 You must be accompanied by a mahram since you reside in the UK.2 3\n\n\nIf your take your husband and pay for his Hajj, the obligation of Hajj for both of you will be fulfilled. If your husband does not wish to accompany you, you should search for another reliable mahram. You will be responsible for the expenses of your mahram. Once you find a reliable mahram, your husband cannot prevent you from going on your obligatory Hajj.4\n\n \n\nIf you cannot find a mahram in your lifetime, you will not be sinful for not performing Hajj. You should make a bequest that a Hajj-Badal be performed on your behalf. Your inheritors will then be responsible to find someone to perform the Hajj on your behalf.5 \n\nIf one of your small children is breastfeeding and there is no one else who can breastfeed on your behalf and your child does not take to a wet nurse, then to protect the child, put off your obligatory Hajj until your child is weaned.6 As for children that are already weaned but small in age, there is no excuse there, as they can be cared for at the home of a relative or friend.\n\nMay Allah enable both your and your husband to go on Hajj and may Allah accept the Hajj of all our brothers and sisters. Ameen.\n\nRefer to Fatwa #25540\n\nAnd Allāh Ta'ala Knows Best.\n\n\n\nMl.
