  "answer": "QUESTION\nI did this wazeefa in which you read surat-ikhlas 301 times in each 2 rakat. After reading one should go straight to sleep without speaking to anyone. In your dream if you see a green color then that is good (that thing will be in your favor), red color is for danger & black for sadness. I love this guy very much so I wanted to know that if I will marry him or not. This kind of wazeefa is done for marriage.Well when I went to sleep I think I saw someone wearing a black t-shirt but in the end just when my dream was about to finish I remember I turned around and saw a scarf (a scarf women wear on their head or either a long cloth) & on it was the light green color with white lines in it. And then I wake. I know that I saw the light green color but sometimes I doubt about the black color.I went to sleep again then I saw that I was holding a newborn child (a boy) in my hand and I was calling \"K\" (the guy I love) to come and have a look at OUR child. Basically all throughout the night I had good dreams about 'K' and his family. I did this at a time when he finished off our relationship. Can you please interpret this dream (about the green color, seeing his family and seeing my unborn child) and advice me if I should worry about the black color or the dream or anything else for that matter.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Wazeefa explained by you to determine good and bad in one's dream has no basis in Shari'ah.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen a person requires guidance about anything in the future, he%2Fshe should%0D%0Amake Istikhaara (seek Divine guidance). attached is our standard article on%0D%0AIstikhaara.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0AWHAT IS ISTIKHAARAH?%0D%0A%0D%0AIstikhaarah is to seek guidance from Allah when one is faced with a problem to which no solution is apparent.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhenever a person is faced with a difficult problem, or becomes hesitant in making a decision and his knowledge of the matter is insufficient to guide him then after seeking advice from trusted friends he should turn to Allah and beseech His grace. He should willingly and with an open heart and mind supplicate for divine guidance and ask for direction so that the problem is solved in his own best interest. The Du'aa at such an occasion is called Istikhaarah.%0D%0A%0D%0AIstikhaarah is in fact an invaluable teaching of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) with which the Muslims have been favoured. This blessing could give solace to many for all times to come. It is related in the Hadith that Rasulullah (SAW) use to teach the Istikhaarah to the Sahaabah (RA) like the Qur'an is taught to children. In another Hadith it is stated that 'He does not fail who makes Istikhaarah and he does not regret who makes Mashwarah (consultation).%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the Masnoon Istikhaarah, after one has carried out his responsibility as best as one can, one should hand over the entire matter and oneself to the limitless knowledge of Allah Ta'ala. By resorting to Istikhaarah one is now retrieved of making a decision on ones own.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhenever counsel is sought from a respectable and experienced person, it is expected that he will give good advise and assist to the best of his ability. Similarly Istikhaarah is to seek counsel that the all-Knowing and Merciful Allah? Once Istikhaarah is made then Allah Ta'ala will surely guide him to do what is best for him.%0D%0A%0D%0ANow there can be no perplexity. Only that will happen which Allah Ta'ala wills and which is good for ones own sake though one may not be able to see it immediately. It is not necessary that one must experience or see an evident change or vision. Allah Ta'ala alone knows what is best for His servants. It is related in the Hadith that 'Success and good tidings for the son of Aadam (Insaan) is in performing Istikhaarah and his misfortune lies in not making Istikhaarah'.%0D%0A%0D%0AMETHOD OF ISTIKHAARAH%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen making Istikhaarah begin with performing two Rakaats Nafl Salaat. Then with all sincerity recite the following Du'a.%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AAllaahumma innee astakheeruka bi ilmika wa-astaqdiruka biqudratika wa-as'aluka min fadhlika al-adheem. Fa innaka taqdiru walaa aqdiru. Wa ta'lamu walaa a'alamu wa anta allaamul ghuyoob. Allaahumma in kunta ta'lamu anna haadhal-amr khayrun liy fiy deeniy wa-ma'aashiy wa-aaqibat amriy, fa'qdruhliy wa-yassirh liy thumma baarik liy feehi. Wa in-kunta ta'lamu anna haadhal amr sharrun liy fiy deeniy wa-ma'aashiy was-'aaqibat amriy. Fa asrifh annee wa-srif 'anhu. Wa aqdurh liyal khayr hayth kaana thumma a-rdhiniy bihee%0D%0A%0D%0ATrans: O Allah!! Behold I ask You the good through Your Knowledge, and ability through Your Power, and beg (Your favour) out of Your infinite Bounty. For surely You have Power; I have none. You know all; I know not. You are the Great Knower of all things.%0D%0AO Allah! If in Your Knowledge this matter be good for my faith (Deen), for my livelihood, and for the consequences of my affairs, then ordain it for me, and make it easy for me, and bless me therein.%0D%0ABut if in Your Knowledge, this matter be bad for my faith (Deen) for my livelihood, and for the consequences of my affairs, then turn it away from me, and turn me away therefrom, and ordain for me the good wherever it be, and cause me to be pleased therewith.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhile reciting this Du'aa when one reaches HAADHAL AMR (THIS MATTER) at both places he should think of his problem.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah guide and assist us all, Aameen."
