  "question": "About six months ago, I married a Christian woman. I have a concern thatshould she mother my children, they (my children) might not be raised Islamically. Can I divorce her due to this concern?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is surprising that you address such a major concern only after%0D%0Amarrying the person. Marriage is a major step in life. You ought to have%0D%0Aunderstood the implications of marrying such a person before marriage.%0D%0AHowever, since you have already married the person in question, we advise%0D%0Ayou to exercise caution in your intention of divorcing her. The wisdom of%0D%0Athe permissibility of marrying a woman from the Ahlul Kitaab (Jews and%0D%0AChristians) is to use one's influence to convert her to Islam. Divorcing her%0D%0Amay have a devastating effect on her as well as have a negative image of%0D%0AIslam and Muslims. Unfortunately, many Muslim men marry Christian women and%0D%0Adivorce or abandon them after abusing them. Your marriage is young and you%0D%0Ashould apply wisdom and invite her towards Islam. However, if after making%0D%0Aan effort to do so, you are unsuccessful and you are almost certain that she%0D%0Awill be an unsuitable mother for your children, then you should make%0D%0AIstikhaara (seek Divine guidance) in discontinuing the marriage.%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom: Al Mahmood 13 Q & A from the Darul Ifta%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
