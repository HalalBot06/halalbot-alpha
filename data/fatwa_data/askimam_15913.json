  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan you please forward me your views on the Albaraka equity fund.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1.\nThe surplus funds in the absence of a bonafide Shariah Compliant transaction, between two financial exchanges, is interest (Riba).\n\nConsider the following illustration.\n\n   A                              =>                  B                 = surplus  = Profit permissible.\nSeller                (valid and              Purchaser\n                        recognized sale)\n\nThe surplus is through a recognized transaction, hence it is profit and permissible.\n\n   A                      =>                            B                         = Surplus = Not permissible.\nSeller                (not a valid              Purchaser\n(company)       transaction)              Of shares\n\nThe surplus in the purchase of the shares is not through a recognized Shari transaction, hence it is not a profit.\nThe surplus will be in lieu of money – hence it is interest and haram.\n\n2.\nThe transaction of purchasing shares in a stock market is not a valid purchase and sale for various reasons.\nKindly find attached our detailed research on the matter.\n\n3.\nIt should also be borne in mind that interest is clearly haram. In principle, any transaction that even borders on the brinks of interest (shibhe Riba) is haram. In the face of such clear facts, the spirit of an Allah conscious person should be to steer away from haram and even that which is doubtful.\n\n4.\nIt is therefore not permissible to invest in any shares of the stock market even though it may be through any Bank or Financial Institution.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
