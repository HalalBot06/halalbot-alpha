  "question": "Will everyone get an equal share of happiness and unhappiness during life? Or can taqdeer be changed by dua?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nHaving led a very secure and care free life till my marriage, I had health problems , a very painful pregnancy and a miscarriage at 7th month. Alhamdolillah i have a very supportive husband, but being away from my homecountry and lonely, sometimes makes me think of all the unhapiness people have had to face, and makes me wonder what there is in store for me. Can dua change whatis written in ones taqdeer?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nTaqdeer refers to the absolute and perfect knowledge of Allah Ta'ala. This\nknowledge cannot change as it is perfect.\n\nThe meaning of the statement, 'Du'aa can change Taqdeer' is this that at\ntimes Allah Ta'ala orders the angels to carry out a certain order.\nThereafter, after accepting the Du'aa of a person, Allah Ta'ala changes the\ninstruction given to the angel.\n\nHowever, as far as the absolute knowledge of Allah Ta'ala is concerned,\nnothing has changed. Allah Ta'ala knew from beforehand that He will be\nchanging the command given to the angel. Thus, looking at the matter from\nthe side of the angel, fate has changed. Yet, as far as Allah Ta'ala is\nconcerned, nothing has changed. As Muslims, we are required to make Du'aa\nwith full hope and by adopting all the correct means for achieving our\ndesires, and thereafter, be pleased with whatever has decreed by His wisdom.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim"
