  "question": "Are women allowed to become divers and participate in ocean activities or work in the related environment?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is the ruling with regards to muslim women and the ocean?..Are women allowed to become divers and participate in ocean activities or work in the related environment?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe wish to make the following points before issuing a ruling.\n\nA woman’s place in Islam is at home. Allah states, ‘… and remain in your homes and do not exhibit like the time of the first Jaahiliyyah.’ The reason for this is human beings by nature are attracted to the opposite gender. If a woman is given open permission to leave their homes without any conditions, necessity, Hijaab, etc. there will be widespread evil on earth. This is what the world is actually experiencing due to the free intermingling gender policy.\n\nDiving and ocean activities is not only a sport. There is much more to that. The costume reveals the form and shape of the body and private parts. This attracts the attention of the same gender and the opposite gender. The concentration by the female onlookers to male participants is on the masculine attributes. The male onlookers to female participants is on the body in general and the revealing movements of her body by her brilliant performance. There is no doubt of the evils the flow from such activities. There is no need recognized in Shari’ah for a woman to take part in such activities and it is against shame and modesty. In fact, no Muslim should even be present in such evil places of Shaytaan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
