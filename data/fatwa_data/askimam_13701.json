  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIn the Jumuah Khutbahs, am i allowed to add any english to the arabic khutbahs near the ending of the first khutbahs and can women pray jumuah from the next room?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe universally accepted practice passed on from generation to generation beginning with the golden era of Islam (upon which there is consensus of the Ummah) is that the Khutbah may only be given in Arabic. This can easily be appreciated if we accept that the purpose of the Khutbah is Dhikr (Surah Jumu’ah).\n\nThus, its purpose can neither be only to educate nor advise. The prestine practice of the illustrious Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhum] clearly bears testimony to this fact. Not a single incident from their lives can be proven wherein the Khutbah was given in any other language other than Arabic despite them traveling to foreign lands (non-Arabic speaking lands). However, if during the Khutbah, an unforeseen incident occurs which necessitates that the Khatib correct it, i.e. enjoining good or forbidding evil, and this can only be achieved through speaking another language, then it is permissible. A general rule of permissibility of adopting another language in the Khutbah does not fall within the ambit of this concession, and to do so Makrooh-e-Tahrimi. We advise that the Jumu’ah programmes be organized such that a separate time be allocated for English talks which will fulfil the need for advise and education.\n\nWith regard to women performing Jumu’ah Salaat, it is more virtuous for them to perform Dhuhr Salaat at home. However, if they perform Jumu’ah Salaat in the Musjid observing the rules of Hijaab it is accepted. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyah vol.2 pg.292; Meerut)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
