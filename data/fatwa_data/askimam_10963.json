  "question": "Why fabrication in ahadiths??",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalam Alaikum Dear Imam, I live in the Pak-Indo region. I have come across a number of ahadiths saying that the Prophet?s (SA) noor (light) was created before anything else in the universe was created and that the Prophet (SA) is a noor from Allah. Another hadith quotes that Allah (SWT) says, ?If I hadn?t created you (O ?Muhammad (SA)) I wouldn?t have created the skies? I came to know recently that all these ahadiths are fabricated ones and there are no such proofs in the whole collection of ahadiths. My question is why would a muslim fabricate so many ahadiths and relate a lie to Allah and the Prophet (SA)? What is their purpose behind all this? And can we call such people muslims anymore? Thanks for your attention and time.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou should bear in mind that there exists differences of opinion concerning whether these narrations are really fabricated.Some Ulama hold them to be fabricated ,while others claim that while this exact wording has no basis, its meaning and purport is correct.There are other Ulama who claim that this wording is correct on the basis of other chains of narraters they have found.%0D%0A%0D%0ANevertheless,the motives behind fabricating ahadith are many.Amongst them are:%0D%0A1) Attempting to distort and destroy Islam.This is generally the motive behind the fabrications by hypocrites and enemies of Islam.%0D%0A2) Support of a particular group or mazhab.%0D%0A3) Patriotism%0D%0A4) Attempting to encourage people to increase worship by fabricating narrations mentioning great rewards for certain actions.%0D%0A5) Animosity towards a certain mazhab or group.%0D%0A6) Impressing people by quoting strange narrations during ones lectures.%0D%0A%0D%0AFabrication of ahadith is completely Haraam and the fabricator has been warned by Nabi (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) that he is preparing his abode in Hell.However a person's fabricating a hadith will not render him out of the faith of Islam as long as he does not believe it to be permissible.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
