  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. What is the age that salaat becomes fard. 2. I am 30 yrs old and have missed most of my salaat. How can I make up for it. What would be appropriate way to do it. 3. What is the significance of Jumma. I've been told that one should not miss three jumma in a row. 4. I had a tattoo about 10 yrs ago. I asked a Mufti about it and he advised me to do Taubaa and ask Allah for forgiveness (please advise).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Kindly refer below our standard reply to similar queries.%0D%0A2. Refer 1%0D%0A3. It is narrated in Muslim from Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'The best day the sun rose in%0D%0Ait was Jumu'ah. In it Aadam (Alayhis salaam) was created and in it he was%0D%0Aentered into Jannah and in it he was taken out from it. Qiyaamat will not%0D%0Atake place except on Jumu'ah.' Like this Hadith, there are many other%0D%0Asignificances of Jumu'ah. It is narrated in a Hadith that, 'Whoever misses%0D%0AJumu'ah for no reason, will be written as a hypocrite.' (Mishkaat pg.121). A%0D%0Aperson should not miss even one Salaat, let alone Jumu'ah Salaat. Salaat is%0D%0Athe most important fundamental of Islam after the Kalimah.%0D%0A4. The Aalim has advised you correctly if the tattoo cannot be removed.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AQ: Kindly explain in detail the Shari'ah laws of performing Qadhaa Salaats.%0D%0AYour advice in fulfilling the Qadhaa Salaats will be appreciated.%0D%0AA: Qadhaa is made only for Fardh and Witr Salaats.%0D%0AIn calculation, there will be six (6) Salaats per day, one hundred and%0D%0Aeighty (180) Salaats per month, two thousand, one hundred and sixty (2160)%0D%0ASalaats per year. Calculate the number of missed Salaats from the time of%0D%0ABuloogh (maturity). If one is unable to calculate the actual number of%0D%0Amissed Salaats, due to not having any records, then he%2Fshe should apply%0D%0Ahis%2Fher honest discretion in calculating the missed Salaats.%0D%0AIt is not permissible to give Fidyah (monetary compensation) for the missed%0D%0ASalaats if one is able to fulfil the Qadhaa Salaats. The Fidya for each%0D%0Amissed Salaat is the same as Sadaqatul Fitr (approx. R7.00). The approximate%0D%0Aamount for the missed Salaats for one year will be (approx. R15,000). A%0D%0Abequest should be made during one's lifetime to pay the Fidya for the%0D%0Aunfulfilled Qadhaa Salaats from one third of one's estate after fulfillment%0D%0Aof debts.%0D%0AThank Allah Ta'ala for giving you the concern to fulfil the missed Salaats.%0D%0AHow will one face Allah Ta'ala on the day of Qiyaamat should he%2Fshe pass%0D%0Aaway without fulfilling the Qadhaa Salaats? An easy method to fulfil the%0D%0AQadhaa Salaats is, after each daily Fardh Salaat, for example, after Dhuhr%0D%0ASalaat of today, perform one Dhuhr Qadhaa Salaat."
