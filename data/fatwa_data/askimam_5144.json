  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-u-alaikum Mufti Ebrhaim Sahib. This question is about the wedding ceremony. Back home(in Pakistan) the wedding ceremonies are ridiculous(all hindu culture with dancing and singing and music and mixing of males and females). The parents here want if not those but close to those type of weddings where they can sing and dance at their childrens' wedding because they are happy. Most marriages, I know have cracks that were done like that. A few of my friends here got married Islamically(segregation and pardah and no music) and it turned out excellent. My question is that if we can't convince our parents to have segregation, do we lose the barakat in our wedding and have cracks because of shaitan?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the parents insist on conducting un-Islamic functions, the children\nshould disobey them in this regard. If there is a conflict between Shari'ah\nand the will of the parents, Shari'ah will be given preference.\n\nYou will not lose the Barkaat if you disobey your parents in this regard. In\nfact, there will be more Barkaat in a wedding devoid of un-Islamic\nbehaviour.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
