  "question": "How come the four madhabs cannot unite and become one? There can only be one truth can't there?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAt the moment, ppl of one madhab look down on the followers of another. How can this be a good thing? Why can't all scholars come together and settle their differences? I mean, why do the different madhab's pray differently? I even read that Hanafi scholars said a hanafi couldnt marry a shafi, although it was later changed, allowing men to, but not women. Please give a specific answer to my question, and not the usual answer you give to ppl on taqleed.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn order to understand the concept of Taqleed, kindly consider the%0D%0Afollowing:%0D%0A1. The Imaams of each for the four Madhabs were Mujtahids. A Mujtahid is a%0D%0Ahigh ranking scholar with authority to deduce rulings from the Qur'aan and%0D%0AHadith. He displays intellectual honesty in his conclusions. A Mujtahid is%0D%0Anot bound to follow the conclusions of another Mujtahid if his research is%0D%0Adifferent. If he would do so, that will be intellectual dishonesty.%0D%0A2. Differences of opinion among the Imaams should be viewed as a mercy to%0D%0Athe Ummah. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'The differences%0D%0Aamong my Ulama is a mercy.' Should there be only one ruling in every issue%0D%0Aas is the case in many unanimous rulings, there would not be a leeway in%0D%0Asome important matters. For example, according to some Imaams, only a Muslim%0D%0Ajudge in an Islamic state may annul a marriage in a marital dispute if there%0D%0Aare grounds of annulment. A marriage cannot be annulled in a non-Muslim%0D%0Acountry. That poses difficulty for many married Muslim women who have%0D%0Agrounds for annulment of marriage but their marriage cannot be annulled as%0D%0Athey reside in a non-Muslim country. In such a situation, the Maaliki Madhab%0D%0Awill be applied that the leaders of the Muslim community in a non-Muslim%0D%0Acountry will assume the position of a Muslim judge and annul the marriage.%0D%0A3. All the Madhabs believe 'Our Madhab is correct but there is a possibility%0D%0Aof an error - the other Madhab are incorrect but may be correct.' It is,%0D%0Atherefore,incorrect for any adherent of any Madhab to display intolerance to%0D%0Aanother Madhab. The view that a Hanafi cannot marry a Shaafi'ee, etc. is%0D%0Aabsolutely incorrect. A Hanafi male or female may marry a Shaafi'ee, Maaliki%0D%0Aor Hanbali male or female.%0D%0A4. Who can claim having knowledge, at least, equivalent to anyone of the%0D%0Agreat Imaams. Each imam was an expert in Qur'aan, Hadith, Fiqh. Based on the%0D%0Aabove, a) Will one scholar or a group of scholars be appointed as a judge to%0D%0Adecide on each juridical ruling of such illustrious scholars? b) What%0D%0Acriteria will one adopt to formulate one Madhab? c) Does one expect to%0D%0Aarrive at a unanimous decision on this procedure?%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
