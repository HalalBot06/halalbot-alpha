  "question": "Is it permissible to say Ya Abdal Qadir Maddad",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCould you please give an answer of istighaatha-not the tawassul standard answer on your website.\n\nIs it permissible to say Ya Abdal Qadir Maddad..if one believes that the angels will take this nida to him and that his maddad is by the leave of Allah.\n\nThis is the practice of shaykh muhammad al alawi al maliki al makki in his text called mafaheem  yujab an tusahhu. Also shaykh nuh haa meem keller and the sufi ulema of jordan and syria allow this. Please reference your answer with the aqwaal of the classical fuqaha\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nIt is not permissible to say “Ya Abdal Qadir Madad” as this is shirk.The Fuqaha have explicitly mentioned that seeking help from the dead is Shirk.\n\nIt is also not permissible to say “Ya Abdal Qadir Madad” with the belief that the angels will take the Nida (call) and the sheikh’s assistance is only by the will of Allah as this gives the hint of Shirk. The general masses do not differentiate between such fine issues.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
