  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam o alaikum, Jinab mufti saheb..my frriend got married few months ago. It was love marriage, but now her husband has changed alot. He became so strick ,(maybe he do not trust her ).He use to call her 3 or 4 times a day,(asking about her daily schedule) he lives in USA, and my friend is in Iran with her parents, he do not let her to go out with her parents too.Please suggest some dua and or wadhifa for her. Thanks(Jazakallah!).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen one is faced with some difficulty, then the problem must also be addressed. Merely making Du?aa is not sufficient if there are ways of addressing the problem.\n\nIt is not appropriate for us to address the problem of your friend without knowing the complete details. In the first place, why are they living separate and why does her husband place restrictions on her to go out with her parents?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
