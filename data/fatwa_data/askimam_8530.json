It will be difficult for us to explain to you the entire procedure. We suggest that you get the book called, ?The Salaat of a Believer in the light of Qur?aan and Sunnah? written by Shayk Abu Yusuf Riyadhul-Haqq. The book is obtainable from Islamic Shari?ah Institute, UK\n\n2. Yes, Imaam Abu Hanifa (RA) did study in Madina. This was around about 102 Hijri. At that time, seven of the great Taabi?een were the central figures of Islamic jurisprudence and Hadith. However, when Imaam Abu Hanifa (RA) reached Madina only two of them Sulaymaan and Saalim ibn Abdullah were alive. Sulaimaan was the slave of Maymoonah (Radhiallaahu Anhu) who was one of the noble wives of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) whilst Saalim ibn Abdullah was the grandson of Hadhrat Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu). Abu Hanifa (RA) studied under both these eminent men. It is apparent from here that his link of Hadith led up directly to Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Similarly, Abu Hanifa (RA) also had the good fortune of meeting Anas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) who was a Sahabi of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). He was also a dedicated student of Hammaad (RA). Hammaad (RA) head Ahaadith from the personal attendant of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) who was Anas (Radhiallaahu Anhu). Hammaad?s school of Fiqh was originated by Hadhrat Abdullah ibn Mas?ood (Radhiallaahu Anhu), another eminent Sahaabi (Radhiallaahu Anhu).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
