  "question": "Can i sell female cosmetics?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know if I sell make-up, cosmetics and perfumery items of some European brand to my female colleagues at work and friends with a commission from this company to me for each item I sell, am I doing something wrong by selling these products? Because some of these Muslim ladies might use these products in public and they?ll be doing something haram. Will I share this sin with them because I was the one who sold these products to them in the first place? Bearing in mind that some ladies might use it strictly for their husbands only.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt will be permissible for you to sell cosmetics, perfumes, etc to your female colleagues. If the buyer uses it for the wrong purpose, she will be sinful and you will not be responsible for her actions. (Fataawaa Mahmoodiyah, Vol. 15, Page 392)\n\nHowever, it will be better not to sell these products to such women who you know are going to use it for the wrong purpose.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf"
