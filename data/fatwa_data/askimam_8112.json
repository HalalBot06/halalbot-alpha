  "question": "How much effect does the curse of a person one has wronged in past have? If the person has sought sincere repentence...Why is Prophet Isa (a.s.) referred to as \"ruh-ullah\"?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow much effect does the curse of a person one has wronged in past have? If the person has sought sincere repentence, will he be forgiven for his deeds, or must he seek the forgiveness of the person harmed? What if it is not possible to seek such forgiveness (due to death of the individual, or being unlocatable?) 2) Please kindly relate a dua of rasulullah (s.w.s) to increase one's rizq, or find a source of employment. 3) Why is Prophet Isa (a.s.) referred to as \"ruh-ullah\"? Doesnt that translate to \"spirit of Allah\"? Please relate the propper interpretation of this term, and how it is different from the Christian assertions regarding Isa. a.s. being a Holy Spirit, part of the trinity.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If you have wronged someone in the past, make Tawbah and also seek forgiveness from the person himself. However, if he can?t be located or has passed away, you should make Du?aa-e-Maghfirah for him and do some good deeds and send the rewards to him. Insha Allah, you will be forgiven.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Recite Surah Baqarah Aayat201 and Surah Shura Aayat19. insha Allah, Allah will grant blessings.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Kindly refer attached%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Deviation Of The Christians And Their Belief In Trinity%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above verses begin by addressing the whole of humanity collectively. Allaah says, \"O Mankind! Indeed the messenger has come to you with the truth from your Rabb; so believe, it will be better for you.\" Imaan is in itself a great good and it will save a person from the everlasting torment of the Aakhirah (Hereafter) and shall allow him to enjoy the bliss of Jannah. On the other hand, \"If you disbelieve, then (Allaah is Independent because) verily to Allaah belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth.\"%0D%0A%0D%0A\"Allaah is ever All Knowing, The Wise.\" The Imaan and kufr of people cannot be concealed from Allaah and He shall reward and punish according to His wisdom.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"O People of the Book! Do not commit excesses in you Deen (religion) and attribute the truth only to Allaah.\" The Christians believe that Hadhrat Isa (A.S.) is the son of Allaah and hold the belief of trinity to this day. The Jews claim that Hadhrat Uzair (A.S.) is the son of Allaah, they slander Hadhrat Maryam (A.S.), reject the Nabihood of Hadhrat Isa (A.S.) and are adamant that they killed him.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllaah refutes these beliefs in the Qur'aan, but they still hold them. In addition, the Christians go a step further by claiming (Allaah forbid) that Allaah had His son crucified as expiation for all of their sins. All of this amounts to being excessive in Deen (religion) and attributing lies to Allaah.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhatever the Ahlul Kitaab have to say regarding Hadhrat Isa (A.S.) is all incorrect. Allaah then defines the position of His noble messenger by saying, \"The Maseeh Isa, the son of Maryam was but the messenger of Allaah, His word that He cast to Maryam and a spirit from Him.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AOne of the interpretations of Hadhrat Isa (A.S.) being the \"word\" of Allaah is as mentioned in Surah Yaseen, where Allaah says, \"The instruction of Allaah when He decrees something is that He says, 'Be!' and it comes to pass.\" [Surah 36, verse 82]%0D%0A%0D%0AIt has been discussed in Surah Aal Imraan that when Hadhrat Maryam (A.S.) expressed surprise that she would bear a child when no man had touched her, the angel told her, \"In this way Allaah creates what He wills. When He decrees a matter, He has only to say, `Be!' and it is\" (Surah 3, verse 47). Because Hadhrat Isa (A.S.) was not born normally, his birth is attributed directly to Allaah's instruction of \"Kuun!\" (Be!).%0D%0A%0D%0AThe question then arises why is only Hadhrat Isa (A.S.) referred to as Allaah's word when everything is created with the instruction of \"Kuun!\"? Quoting from Imam Ghazali (A.R.), the author of \"Ruhul Ma'aani\" writes that the birth of a child has two causes. One is the near and apparent cause (i.e. conception, pregnancy and delivery). The other is the further or hidden cause viz. Allaah's instruction of \"Kuun!\" Since the first apparent cause was absent in the case of Hadhrat Isa (A.S.), his birth can be related only to the second hidden cause which is the word of Allaah.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"Ma'aalimut Tanzeel\" (Vol.1, Pg.502) explains that the meaning of \"He cast to Maryam\" is that Allaah informed Hadhrat Maryam (A.S.) of the pending birth.%0D%0A%0D%0AWith regard to the phrase \"a spirit from Him,\" he writes that although Hadhrat Isa (A.S.) is a spirit like every other person, Allaah has specially mentioned him to express his elevated position in nearness to Allaah. This is just as Masaajid are referred to as Allaah's homes to denote their importance. Other commentators mention that \"spirit\" in this context refers to the `nafgh' i.e. the breath of Hadhrat Jibra'eel (A.S.) when he blew the spirit of Hadhrat Isa (A.S.) into Hadhrat Maryam (A.S.).%0D%0A%0D%0AOthers are of the opinion that the Arabic word \"rooh\" should not be translated as spirit, but rather as `mercy.' This is not farfetched because it could be extracted from the root word `rahmah,' which means `mercy.' Others have interpreted the word to mean `inspiration.' In this case, Allaah inspired Hadhrat Maryam (A.S.) with the message of the imminent birth. Yet another group maintain that `spirit' refers to Hadhrat Jibra'eel (A.S.) since he conveyed to Hadhrat Maryam (A.S.) the glad tidings of the birth.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"So believe in Allaah and His messengers and do not say that there are three gods. \" Up to the present, the Christians are divided into numerous denominations. Some say that Hadhrat Isa (A.S.) is Allaah, believing that Allaah entered into the body of Hadhrat Isa (A.S.). %0D%0AOthers say that Allaah, Hadhrat Isa (A.S.) and Hadhrat Maryam (A.S.) are collectively one god. This is the concept of trinity that is refuted in this verse as well as verses 17, 72 and 73 of Surah Maa'idah.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllaah informs them with regard to this, \"It will be best for you to desist\" from these erroneous beliefs, and understand that \"Allaah is only One Deity. He is Pure from having children. \" This emphasises that that not only does Allaah not possess children, but it is impossible that He could ever have them since having children indicates a form weakness (dependency, etc) and will then be a defect. Allaah is Pure from all types of defects and weaknesses. Just as it would be shirk and kufr to believe in other deities, it will be the same to attribute children to Allaah.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"To Him belongs what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. \"All of this is His creation, so how is it possible that any of them can be His partner or His children?%0D%0A%0D%0A\"Allaah is sufficient as a Defender.\" Allaah created everything and cares for each one of them. He has no necessity for children, nor partners. Therefore, only He should be worshipped and requested for assistance."
