  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy Manager and I often debate around religion.He is off the opinion that religion is man made.I am looking for material / explanation to prove to him otherwise.He often brings science into the debate,mentioning how energy moves around and contributes to the worlds existence.Could you please forward to me an explanation that would make him understand.Shukran\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nAbsurdities contained in man made religions can lead a person to believe that all religions are made up. However, painting all religions with the same brush is not a prudent thing to do as it would then necessitate saying that God, after He created us, left us in the dark without any guidance. This would be against the Wisdom of God. There is only one true religion and that is Islam. Invite you manager to study it with an open mind.\n\nIf your manager, on the other hand, does not believe in the existence of God at all, ask him if he knows of any apparatus, device, gadget, machine or factory that came into existence by itself without anyone designing and creating it. If he says no then ask him how can the whole universe with all its galaxies, planets, and diverse and intricate systems come into existence by itself? If a person starts claiming that a factory, for example, came into existence by itself i.e. there was no human intervention and it popped up out of thin air, how would anyone rate his IQ? Obviously, everyone would say that he is a lunatic! How, then, can a sensible person claim that the whole universe, with all its countless systems and their perfect orchestration and synchronization, came into existence by itself?\n\nWe recommend the book ‘The Bible, the Qur’an and Science’ by Maurice Bucaille. In this book, the learned author analyzed the scientific data in the Qur’an and the Bible in the light of the established principles of Science. The conclusion drawn by the analysis is the complete uniformity of the scientific data in the Quran with Science, and the lack of it in the case of certain aspects of the Biblical texts. The agreement of the scientific data in the Quran with the established principals of Science is a proof, in itself, of the authenticity of the Quran. How could someone have guessed – and guessed correctly without any single mistake – about the hundreds of scientific phenomena described in the Quran more than 1,400 years ago in the deserts of Makkah and Madinah? The natural conclusion drawn is that the Quran can only be a revelation from the Creator of the heavens and the earth and the Fashioner of the scientific phenomena therein: Allah Subhaana wa Ta’ala.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMl.
