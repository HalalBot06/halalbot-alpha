  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know the status of Misyar in Islam.\n\nThe attached article was published in the Daily Dawn.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe have received your correspondence and noted its contents. Despite a thorough study of the attached article, we are unable to issue an official ruling without studying the issue from its original source, i.e. the marriage contract.\n\nNewspaper articles have a proven track record of inconsistencies and unreliability. If you are in a position to secure a copy of the original contract, kindly forward it to us. We trust that Saudi Arabia, being a Muslim country with abundant Ulama, would not recklessly develop or sanction something which will compromise the spirituality and Imaan of millions of Muslims.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
