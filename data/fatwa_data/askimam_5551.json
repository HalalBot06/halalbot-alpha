The very common being that of aids,\ndepression, etc. all those who become involved in such relationships find\nthat they are remorseful over such relationships.\n\nIt is a welcoming note that we are shown or realize our wrongs in this\nworld, when the doors of repentance is still open. Allah Ta'ala will forgive\nif we are sincere. However, we get tested to see if our repentance is\nsincere or not. Be patient the correct spouse will be found at the time when\nTaqder is written for it. Allah Ta'ala says in the Qur'aan, 'O you who\nbelieve! Do not despair in the mercy of Allah.'\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
