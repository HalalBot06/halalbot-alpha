  "question": "Can you please tell me what the ruling is with regards to money that is earned by a son, and how much the father is entitled to. Even if the father is not ill or disabled.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI ask this as my Father demands money from me and then wastes it on telephone call that are long distance. I would like to save so that I can purchase a property and settle down with a wife. I am certain that the money is only spent on telephone calls and not the family as my parents are seperated and the children live with the mother. Jazakallah khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari'ah, a Baaligh person (adult) has an independent right over his possessions.\n\nHe has to support his dependants, wife, children, etc. If his father is poor\nand needy, he has to support him as well. If you are certain that your\nfather is self-sufficient and is abusing your money, you are not obliged to\nsupport him. However, we advise you be respectful and kind to your father by\noffering him voluntary assistance.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
