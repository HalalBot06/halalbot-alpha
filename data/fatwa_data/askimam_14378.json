  "question": "From when I was muslim?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nFrom when I was muslim?\n\nAssalamuâlaikum, Before I reverted, I studied about Islam,was eating Halal food and occasionaly read Kalimah from kittab verbally and later asked my friends about right pronunciation. I used to listen Qur'an daily and used to think that \"if I become a muslim, I'll pray 5 times, I will use this name and so on.\" However, I was not thinking that I was already muslim or not. As for my former religion(christian), to convert they need some special ceremony. I was thinking Islam may need as well. I would be muslim if Allah wills at any time. So I was waiting for a chance to be a muslim. I sometimes asked muslim friend to make duâ for me when he prays. Alĥamdulillah, he learned from scholar how to be muslim for me. SIMPLE step. Since, I try my best to practice upon Sunnah and started tabligh jamaah as I found it is the easiest way to practice Deen. Recently I found that I need Qada because I learned how to pray a week later after I read Shahadah officialy because I didn't have any Mahram nor lady muslim frineds to teach me. Those 1 week I was sitting down on the musallah at prayer time. My question is, from when was I a muslim? Not sure from when I started believing that Islam is the true religion. It may includes half of the Ramadaan period as well. Probably, I remember, when I used to join Iftari (without fasting) 2 years ago, I believed that Islam is the correct way of life, code of life from Allah. How many Qada do I need to do for Salaah and Saum?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nFrom the time you had taken Shahadah for the first time you were a Muslim. Having thoughts of becoming a Muslim and not uttering the words of Shahadah does not make you a Muslim. Therefore, you should apply your discreation and try to determine the very first time you had said the Shahadah. Any Salaah or fast that you have missed after that will have to be made up for.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
