  "answer": "QUESTION\nFor example a friend of mine has a xerox copy store. A certain service he offers in the store costs him Rupee 1.00. However the charge to the buyer is Rupees 5.00. This is Rupees 4.00 in each such transaction. I am not sure if such high profit can be charged. Can you clarify this isssue, in the light of Quraan/Hadith if possible?
