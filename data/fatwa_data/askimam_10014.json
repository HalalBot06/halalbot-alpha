However, with regard to the issue of Da?awah, you could ge into contact with other women via your husband/son/brother, etc. who would attend the Musjid and obtain contact details of other Muslim families from the men in the usjid. Thereafter, you could contact them for the purpose of Da?awah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
