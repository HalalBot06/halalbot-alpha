  "question": "Can women use a razor to remove unwanted hair?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAre women allowed to use a Razor? I have heard several times that it is not allowed in Islam for a woman to use metal on her body, i.e. razor as it is not acceptable and that it either says in The Quran Sharif or in a Holy Hadith that women are not allowed to use a razor or metal on their body. Please let me know if women can or cannot and the reasons. Thank you very much. Jazakallah Khair\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nYes, women can use a razor to remove the hair on their arms, legs, and also the armpit and pubic hair. [i]\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n______________\n\nوفي الإبط يجوز الحلق والنتف أولى ويبتدئ في حلق العانة من تحت السرة ولو عالج بالنورة في العانة يجوز [i]\n\nكذا في الغرائب\n\n الفتاوى الهندية، ٥/ ٣٥٨"
