  "question": "Is \"The Dome of Rock\" masjid al-Aqsa?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMasjid-al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock (Qubbatus sakhraa) are two diffferent masjids within close proximity of each other. Masjid-al-Aqsa has a green dome and is located behind the Dome of the Rock, which has a golden dome and is the bigger of the two masjids. The golden dome was built directly above the rock - visible today inside the masjid - that marks the site of the Prophet's (SAW) ascent to heaven. The rock is also reputed to be where Ibrahim (AS) prepared to sacrifice Ismail (AS).%0D%0ABoth masjids are situated in a walled compound called the Haram al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary). The Haram al-Sharif is what the Jews allege to be the Temple Mount, where the Temple of Solomon [Sulaiman (AS)] once stood. On the west side of the compound, are the supposed remains of part of the wall that formed the Temple of Solomon, revered by the Jews today as the Wailing Wall. This wall is where the Prophet (SAW) tied Buraq on the night of Lailatul Miraj.%0D%0A%0D%0AThere are many websites with a wealth of information on the Dome of the rock and Masjid-al-Aqsa, as well as photographs and maps of the old city of Al-Quds. It is important not to confuse the Dome of the Rock with the Mosque of Umar ibn al-Khattab (RA), as some websites have incorrectly assumed. This masjid is not situated in the Haram al-sharif (which houses only two masjids), but is close by, and is opposite the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
