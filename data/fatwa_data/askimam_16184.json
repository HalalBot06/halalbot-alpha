  "question": "If a man gave his ex wife 3 talaq over a period of time verbally, the Authority (Mus. Assembly) has only 2 on record, is he divorced from this woman?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMights sound like a silly question, i just need clarity of this issue. Shafi\n\nIf a man gave his ex wife 3 talaq over a period of time verbally, the Authority (Mus. Assembly) has only 2 on record, is he divorced from this woman?\n\nÂ \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf a husband issued his wife three talaqs in one sitting or in different sittings, that will be regarded as talaq-e-mughallazah (a permanently irrevocable divorce). They cannot live together as husband and wife even though the authority (Muslim Assembly) has two talaqs recorded.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
