  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. After baby born, what is the maximum time to keep an name to baby.\n\nand what is the procedure to choose a baby name. Very Very good like saheb aur wali allah names.\n\nsomebody say u have to see the time and date of the baby from that u can see the islamic calendar, from their you can keep the baby name? is it correct??? or what is the correct procedure in islamic way?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe parents may choose a suitable Islamic name for a child even before the child is born. If the parents were unable to choose a name, by then, they still have seven days to do so. It is Mustahabb to name the child by, at least, the seventh day.\n\nIt is advisable to name the child according to the name of Anbiyaa (alayhimus salaam) and our pious predecessors, like the Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhu] and the great Ulama and saints. It is also appropriate to keep the child’s name according to the Islamic calendar, for example, the child is born during Dhul-Hijjah, the boy’s name be kept Ibraahim and the girl’s name Hajra.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
