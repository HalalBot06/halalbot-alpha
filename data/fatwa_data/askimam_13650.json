  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n I want to know what kind of right a person has on his/her siblings money, say if a brother is making more money then rest of his sibling then is it obligatory for him to give some amount to his siblings , who are also doing very well but not equal to him. Also what is the parent's right on their kids income ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to the Shari’ah, an individual has complete right over his wealth. If a brother has more wealth than his siblings, then he is not bound to give his wealth or part of his wealth to his siblings especially when the siblings are wealthy.\n\nThe parents also do not have any right over this children’s wealth. However, if one’s parents or siblings are poor and needy, then they are entitled to the wealth of their child or sibling according to the Shari’ah laws of Nafaqah (maintenance) as stipulated and outlines by the Fuqahaa.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
