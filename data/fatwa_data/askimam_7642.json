  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe Quran is the book that God calls COMPLETE, PERFECT and FULLY DETAILED. Prophet Muhammed (phuh) only followed the Quran, so why do muslims these days follow all these other hadiths? See 6:19.,38 and 114; 7:52; 17:12; 11:1; 41:3; 12:111, and 16:89\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two types of Wahy (revelation); a) Revelation (Wahy) which is recited (i.e. Qur?aan), and b) Revelation which is not recited (i.e. Hadith)%0D%0A%0D%0AAccording to the principles of Fiqh, both types are considered as Wahy (revelation). Allah Ta?ala states, ?Whatever he (prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) says is not of his desires, it is definitely Wahy (revelation) which is revealed to him.?%0D%0A%0D%0AFollowing the Qur?aan independently is not enough as many of the Qur?aan are explained in the Ahaadith, for example, where does it say in the Qur?aan to perform 2 Rakaats of Fajr, 4 of Dhuhr, 4 of Asr, etc. where does it say in the Qur?aan that time of Fajr commences at a certain time and ends at a certain time? These are all explained in the Ahaadith of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0AIt could be then said if these different injunctions of the Shari?ah are not in the Qur?aan, then how can the Qur?aan be termed as complete? The answer is that because Ahaadith fall on the second category of Wahy (revelation) and the Hadith is an explanation to the Qur?aan, therefore, the Qur?aan still remains complete and perfect.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0Afor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
