  "answer": "QUESTION\nas in writing and without voice or video. however all four parties are confirmed to be there i.e. the man and woman and two male witnesses. the man asks the woman to marry on msn and the woman accepts while two males have been invited onto that same conversation on msn. would that be a legal nikah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNikah will not be valid as it is a condition that the contract be concluded verbally for those who are capable of speech.
