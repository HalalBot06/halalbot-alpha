  "answer": "QUESTION\nis it allowed to do swimming in a pool where there are families sitting outside the pool. no ladies inside, can a man talk to a women when proposing her for marriage or can he only see her once and the rest of the issues are taken care by the family members. what is preffered, can we read the holy quran or any other religious books while sitting at back seat of the car or lying in the bed. i wanted to ask you what is the islamic way of doing intercourse for the first time. Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. It is permissible on condition the Satr of the person in the pool is not exposed. The Satr of a male is the area between the navel and the knee. Furthermore, the family members can be only Mahrams (those with whom marriage is prohibited, e.g. mother, sister, daughter, etc.) Cousins are not Mahrams. This restriction is based on closing the doors of Fitnah.\n\n2. It is permissible to read the Qur’aan and other Islamic literature while sitting in the back seat of the car. This is not regarded as disrespect.\n\n3. Refer ‘Etiquettes of Marital Relations’ on our site.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
