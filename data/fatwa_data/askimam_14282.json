  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease can you give clear guidance with regards to women cutting the hair on their head.\n\nAt present, my hair reaches to my hips. In this condition, it is very difficult to manage, it is very difficult to wash, it is very difficult to dry and it cannot be styled.\n\nI do understand that it is detestable for a woman to resemble a man, which therefore includes having short hair. I also understand that I should be beautiful and rejuvenate my beauty for my husband, which might therefore include the need to style my hair. I also feel as though I am carrying a heavy weight on my head which.\n\nBearing all of these points in mind, please can you give me (and all other women who are faced with this issue) the clear cut position of the Shariah with regards to women cutting the hair of their head – especially clear instructions with the regards to length.\n\nYou may also wish to know that I follow Imam Abu Hanifa’s (ra) interpretation of the Shari’ah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is a great bounty of Allah to be bestowed with normal hair. There are so many women whose hair keep falling. They are almost bald. This bounty of Allah should be appreciated and taken care of to the best of one’s ability.\n\nThe Deen of Islam is very easy. When taking a shower, it is not necessary to wet one’s hair. When one takes Ghusl of Janaabah, then only it is necessary to wet the base/root of every hair. It is not necessary to unplait the tresses. Today, Allah has made it so easy for us, by using a hair dryer, the difficulty of drying hair turns out to be very minimal. It is not permissible for women to cut their hair according to the Hanafi Madhab. (Dur al-Mukhtar vol.6 pg.407; Halabi)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
