The name Asher means: companion, associate, comrade, friend.[2]\n\nIt is a good name to keep.\n\n2. The name Ashir has two meanings: \n\n1. Tax collector.[3]\n\n2. someone/something who/which is tenth in order.[4]\n\n3. Hashir means: one who assembles/gathers the masses. This is one of the names of Nabi salallāhu ‘alayhi wasallam.[5] \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Ismail Desai\nStudent, Darul Iftaa\nSouth Africa\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net\n\n\n\n\n[1] Abu Dawood, 4948.
