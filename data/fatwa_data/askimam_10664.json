  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCould you please answer the following questions in detail, with Hadiths and Qur?anic Ayats\n(1) What is Da?wah and Tabligh?\n(2)Why do we need to carry this work out?\n(3)What is the purpose of this work?\n(4)What are the benefits of this work, what will happen in this world if people carry it out\n(5) what are the possible rewards a person can get from doing this work and going out for Ghasht in this life and the hereafter?\n(6) What is the benefit in doing the 5 amaals (taleem, 2.5 hours to mosque, umumi ghasht, behruni ghasht, 3 days per month) of the mosque and home?\n(7) What is the benefit in going 40 days every year, 4 months as soon as possible?\n(8)What is the benefit in going in masturaat jamaats?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n1. Da'wah and Tabligh basically implies invitation to good deeds irrespective the method of invitation. It may be written, verbal or electronic. There are a number of verses in the Qur?aan exhorting us to invite to good works. For instance, ?Call unto the path of your Lord with wisdom??, ?Command (others) to do good and prevent (others) from evil.?\n2. It is a duty of every Muslim to practise upon these verses in whichever way possible. It doesn?t have to be carried out in the form of the present day Tabligh Jamaat. Each person is responsible for the betterment of his own subordinates.\n3. The objective of this work is firstly self reformation and secondly, the attainment of the pleasure of Allah.\n4. The benefits of this work are strikingly clear for those who wish to understand. In our present day society, the Tableegh Jamat is perhaps the only movement which has taken this Deen to virtually every corner of the globe.\n5. The reward lies with Allah in the hereafter.\n6. The benefits of these A'amaal are glaring. You need to take active part to realise their benefits.\n8. Mastooraat Jamaat enables the womenfolk also to propagate this Deen directly to other women.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\nSuplementary Answer to # 7.\n\n...a person going out for 3 days, 40 days, 4 months, etc. does not become an expert on Shariáh, but he will learn the basic requirements of Shariáh. The more time he gives, the more he will learn and perfect himself. The time frame is not a criteria according to Shariáh. It is not regarded as compulsory in the Shari’ah. The time is merely recommended like the time frame for any course in college and university. There is no prohibition in Shari’ah to set time frames for learning and training....\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
