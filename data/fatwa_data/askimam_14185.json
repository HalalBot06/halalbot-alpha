  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy wife and I intend to do Nazir in respect of our daughter who is suffering from mental disturbance and epilepsy. Please advise the procedures on how to do it. We intend to fast for a period a greed upon with my wife.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe are sad to know about the sickness of your daughter. We make du’aa that Allah grants her a speedy recovery, Aameen.\n\nThis sickness is a test from Allah. He grants sickness and He is the Shafee (curer). Turn to Him and make du’aa. The act of Nazr is also a form of worship and invokes the mercy of Allah. To fast as an act of Nazr is permissible. However, you should condition your mind that Allah hears all du’aas and know the acts of worship of his sincere slaves. He will grant his slaves what they ask for, or something else which is better in the knowledge of Allah or the best in the hereafter.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
