This has proven to be very effective.\n\nNevertheless, your father’s condition is the will and decree of Allah Ta’ala. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ‘Sickness is an atonement for a person’s sickness and a means of higher stages in Jannah.’\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
