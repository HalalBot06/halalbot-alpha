  "question": "What is the wisdom behind not having to provide maintenance to an ex-wife?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nA (pro-feminist) sister asked me about this, and stated that it seemed very unfair to the ex-wife. While married, she does not have time to study as she is rearing the children nor does she earn any of her own income, and therefore is left with very few possessions and no skills to earn a living at the time of divorce. Please explain the wisdom behind this law from Allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMaintenance for Divorced Women:%0D%0AShah Banu Case%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Supreme Court of India recently ruled in the SHAH BANU case that a%0D%0Adivorced woman is entitled under Islamic Law to maintenance beyond die%0D%0Aperiod of iddat and until her remarriage. The case has caused a furore in%0D%0AIndia as die judgement is contrary to Islamic Law.%0D%0A%0D%0ASimply put, the Islamic Law position is that a divorced woman is not%0D%0Aentitled to maintenance beyond the period of iddat. Let us examine this%0D%0Abriefly in the light of the Qur'an and Hadis.%0D%0A%0D%0AVerse 6 of SURAH TALAAQ provides that:%0D%0A\"If the (DIVORCED) women are pregnant, then maintain them UNTIL delivery of%0D%0Atheir child.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AVerse 4 of the surah has already provided that the iddat (mandatory waiting%0D%0Aperiod) for pregnant divorced women is until delivery of child. This verse%0D%0A(verse 6) clearly by the use of the word \"UNTIL\" limits the period of%0D%0Amaintenance to the time of delivery. It follows that if pregnant women are%0D%0Ato be maintained until expiry of their iddat (at delivery), then others are%0D%0Alikewise to be maintained until expiry of their iddat. The periods of iddat%0D%0Afor menstruating or non-menstruating women have been specified in the%0D%0AQur'an. (S 2 : V 228; S 65 : V 4; S 65 : V 4)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe absence of an obligation to maintain after the expiry of iddat is%0D%0Asupported by authentic HADIS, notably that of FATIMA BINT QAIS. The latter%0D%0Awas divorced by her husband, and the Holy Prophet (SAW) ruled that she was%0D%0Anot entitled to maintenance. (SAHIH MUSLIM: KITABUT TALAAQ).%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the result, no jurist has ever held that, a divorced woman is entitled to%0D%0Amaintenance after expiry of iddat. On the contrary, and in the case of%0D%0Adivorce of the category BAAIN, many jurists have held that only pregnant%0D%0Awomen are entitled to maintenance for the iddat period: non-pregnant women%0D%0Aare excluded.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Supreme Court judgement according to press reports relied on verse 241%0D%0Aof SURAH BAQARAH, which was translated as follows: \"FOR DIVORCED WOMEN,%0D%0AMAINTENANCE SHOULD BE PROVIDED ON REASONABLE SCALE. THIS IS A DUTY TO THE%0D%0ARIGHTEOUS.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AThe word MATA in the verse means \"BENEFIT\" which includes maintenance within%0D%0Aits meaning. (See MAARIFUL QUR'AN) The verse therefore lays down a general%0D%0Aprinciple relating to the benefit due to all divorced women in the different%0D%0Acircumstances as a consequence of divorce. Hence, the use of the wider word%0D%0A\"benefit\" (MATA) and not the specific word NAFAQA (maintenance). The benefit%0D%0Adue to divorced women in the different circumstances is as follows:%0D%0A1. If no dowry has been fixed and no sexual intercourse has taken place%0D%0Aprior to divorce, then the husband is only obliged to give some benefit or%0D%0Agifts to the wife. (S2:V236).%0D%0A2. If a dowry has been fixed and no sexual intercourse has taken place prior%0D%0Ato divorce, then the husband is only obliged to give the wife half the%0D%0Aamount of the dowry. (S 2 : V 237)%0D%0A3. If both a dowry has been fixed and sexual intercourse took place prior to%0D%0Adivorce, then the full dowry must be given to the wife. (S 4 : V 4)%0D%0A4. If no dowry has been fixed, but sexual intercourse took place prior to%0D%0Adivorce, then the dowry customarily fixed in the family of the wife (MEHR%0D%0AMITHL) must be given to the wife.%0D%0A5. In the cases of 3 and 4, the wife is obliged to undergo IDDAT and is%0D%0Atherefore entitled to maintenance until expiry of the iddat There is%0D%0Aobviously no iddat (and hence, no maintenance) in cases 1 and 2.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt follows that the judgement of the Indian Supreme Court is wrong. The%0D%0ACourt ought to have heard expert evidence on the issue from qualified Muslim%0D%0Ajurists. It is not clear why this was not done. Instead, the judges%0D%0Aendeavored to give judgement on an issue in which they have no expertise.%0D%0AThe result was a misinterpretation of Islamic Law.%0D%0A%0D%0ANow, what are the rational imperatives? Divorce terminates a marriage%0D%0Awhereupon the parties have no relationship whatsoever with each other. There%0D%0Ais therefore no reason in logic as to why the husband must continue%0D%0Amaintaining the wife after divorce. Reason demands that a person must be%0D%0Afree of obligations. For an obligation to arise, there must be valid cause.%0D%0AWhat cause exists in such a case?%0D%0A%0D%0AIn Islamic law, the obligation to maintain the divorced woman after the%0D%0Aexpiry of the iddat would in the absence of her remarriage vest in her near%0D%0Arelatives based on the priorities fixed in inheritance. In any event, and if%0D%0Ashe is unable to maintain herself, the Islamic State is obliged to do so.%0D%0A%0D%0ASome argue that the divorced woman suffers for want of maintenance, as her%0D%0Anear relatives invariably fail to maintain her. The answer is why must the%0D%0Ahusband be penalized in such event contrary to Quranic Law. Cases of%0D%0Ahardship do arise, one undoubtedly appreciates, in a non-Muslim country%0D%0Awhere Islamic Law is not applied. However, if Muslims implement Islamic Law%0D%0Asincerely and honestly, all problems would be resolved. To do this, a strong%0D%0Aand deep sense of Accountability is required. Unfortunately, this to a large%0D%0Aextent is absent."
