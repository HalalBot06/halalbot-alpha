  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamuailakum\n \nI hve a question for the imam saheb that in about 2 weeks we will be going for our Invitro fertilization here in canada because we had been trying for the past 7 yrs to conceive but noe positive results yet because my husbnd has low sperm count. The doctors has suggested to have that done which is very expensive and physically and mentally painfull too. So my doctors has also suggested that you should also sign for the donor sperm in case at the very last moment when the eggs will  be ready for sperms to be injected if it's not good quality and quantity then it's good to have good sperm ready which would be donor sperm. I was thinking that the child will be our I mean it will have half of my cheomosomes as a mom and i will be giving birth and care so what is the islamic point of view because i was thinking in either circumstances we aare also thinkinh about aadoption but the islamic point of view is not very fair with the adoptive parents so I thought the donor sperm would be better and we aould be doing it only in the certain case because it would be just easy for us rather than being an empty handed. so plz clearly review it in islamic point of view and ASAP becaue we have only 10 days left and I want to know and plz pray for us too;\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf a couple are experiencing difficulty in conceiving a child the natural way, it will be permissible to adopt the procedure of In Vitro Fertilisation with the condition that the sperm belongs solely to the husband and the egg belongs to the wife. It will not be permissible to use a third person’s sperm under any circumstance. (Halal Wa Haraam, Ml Khalid Sayfullah Rahmani, Pg. 302)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
