  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am asking this question for a very dear friend of mine she is very concerned about her  teeth she went to the dentist and they said she has gum disease, they recommended for her to have lumineers done on her four front teeth this will prevent her teeth from gum disease,  and her teeth will be healthy. If she does not have this done her teeth might become wobbly few years down the line as the gum disease is quite severe and creating gaps between her teeth. Please can you advice if this can be done in these circumstances and if its right to do so as she is a Muslim.\n\nThank you very much for taking time reading my question, I would look forward to here form you soon Insha’Allah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt will be permissible to have lumineers done.\n(Ahsanul Fatawa vol.2 pg32, HM Saeed)\n\nAnd Allah knows best \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
