  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nif we got Ehtelam at morning after keeping roza then will fast break in Ramzan? what is the effect on Fast? Kindly give me complete details how roza Breaks. best reagards hamid cheema\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIf one had iĥtilām (wet dream) whist fasting, the fast will not break (Behishti Zewar, pg. 284; Zam Zam). \n\nThere are a number of factors that nullify the fast, including:\n\n1)      If someone ate, drank or smoked\n\n2)      If one vomited intentionally and it amounted to a mouthful\n\n3)      Inhaling smoke\n\n4)      Having sexual intercourse\n\n5)      Taking an enema (medication) or pouring oil into the ears\n\n6)      If one has bleeding gums and the blood mixes with the saliva, then if the blood is tasted in the saliva or is more than the saliva, the Fast will break.\n\nIf any of the above is done forgetfully, then the fast will not break. However, if it is done intentionally or mistakenly, then the fast will break.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
