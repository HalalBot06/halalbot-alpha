  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy Question is in regard to this Q&A .\n\nI had gone to this conference, where the organizers had asked the audience not to record anything. The organization professionally records all the lectures themselves, and later sells them through their website.\n\nSince I paid to get into the conference, does it make it lawful for me to record the lectures for later reviewing, despite the request/rule of the organizers against making individual audio recordings?\n\nI justified this saying to myself, that since I paid to attend the conference, I should be able to record it for my personal use later on. Is that a correct view?\nI am not going to share my recordings on the internet, but what if I share them with my wife who hadn't attended the conference?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1) If there was no rule stating to not record lectures before the attendees paid their fees to attend the conference, then it would be permissible to record for personal use and to share.\n\n2) If there was a rule not to record prior to paying, then it would not be permissible to record and to share. It is not permissible to go against the rule.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Asif Umar,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
