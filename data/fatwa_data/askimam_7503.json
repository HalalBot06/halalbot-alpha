If the parents left behind wealth, the elder brother may use part of it on the younger brother since the wealth belongs to the younger brother as well. However, if the parents left nothing behind and the youngster has not reached puberty and he has no wealth of his own, the elder brother should take care of him. Whatever the elder brother spends on the younger one, it is an act of great reward and favour. He cannot claim it from the younger brother in future.\n\n3.
