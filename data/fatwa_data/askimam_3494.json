  "question": "What should I do if the 1) Imam does masah over socks.2) Replies to a Salaam by raising his hand.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) If the Imam does masah over regular socks should I repeat the prayer if a) I have seen him do masah over regular socks b) I have not seen him do masah (ie he did wudu from home) but know him to do mashah in the masjid, 2) These days a new trend has started in our masjid. When someone enters the masjid they say Salaam loudly and if we are in prayer one of the Imam's raises his right hand. If he does this while leading our jamaat is our prayer valid? Should I repeat it? Jazakallah Khairan\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. To make Masah over regular socks is not permissible (refer attached).\nIf one is certain that his Imaam makes Masah over regular socks, we advise\nhe and the trustees of the Masjid request him to accommodate Musallees like\nyou in washing his feet or making Masah over leather socks. That will be\nconducive to maintaining unity. The attached document be also forwarded to\nhim. However, if he does not accommodate, then Salaat behind him will be\ninvalid.\nIf one performed Salaat behind such an Imaam for the sake of unity, that\nSalaat should be repeated.\n2. It is Makrooh for any person performing Salaat, including the Imaam, to\ngreet with his hands.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
