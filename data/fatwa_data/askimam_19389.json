  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSir, I have a confusion regarding my iddat. I still have a couple of months left. During the period of idaat the woman should not go out of the house for any reason but I was gone out for many reasons as I am a working lady too and living alone with my old age parents. But I was unaware for that matter. Have I committed a mistake. If yes than what should I do now?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nWe appreciate you seeking clarification in the matter.\n\nIn principle, a lady sitting for Iddat should not leave her home except for dire necessity. If you left your home during iddat, then that was sinful. You should make taubah and remain within home from now until your iddat finishes.\n\nIt is the blessed month of Ramadhan. Make abundance of Istighfar and ask Allah to shower your life with mercy. It is hoped from the Majesty of Allah Ta’ala that all your mistakes will be forgiven, insha’Allah.\n\n \n\nDuring your iddat time it is your ex-husband’s duty to support you. However, if he does not support you then your parents should support you. If your parents cannot support you either, then your brothers etc. In case there is no one to support you during your iddat and you are the sole earner for the family and you do not have any other source of income, then there will be a leeway in you leaving home for earning.\n\nWhile you leave the home for work, you should abide by the Shar’i laws of hijab at all times and should return home by nightfall.\n\nPlease download the detailed article on the “rules of iddat”. Kindly read through it very carefully to familiarize yourself with the requirement of Deen in your current state.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Faisal bin Abdul Hameed\nStudent, Darul Iftaa\nCanada\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
