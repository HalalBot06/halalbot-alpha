  "question": "Can you please explain more about the “People of the Book” in regards to marriage. Who does not qualify? If one does qualify what would be the process of proposing to marry them?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for a Muslim female to marry a non-Muslim male. However, a Muslim male may marry only Christian or Jewish female. It is not permissible for a Muslim male to marry any other non-Muslim female. %0D%0A%0D%0AThe reason it is permissible for the Muslim male to marry a non-Muslim female is that he would be able to easily convince the Christian or Jewish wife into accepting Islam. There is a possibility of the non-Muslim male convincing his Muslim wife into abandoning Islam. Therefore, Islam has considered her feminine nature and protected her correct beliefs from being a victim of abuse from the male dominance. %0D%0A%0D%0AThe Muslim husband is not obliged to pressurize his Christian%2FJewish wife to accept Islam. He may apply wisdom and diplomacy and only influence her to Islam. In Islam, a female is equally respected as a male, however, due to the different masculine and feminine natures, Islam believes in separation of roles. %0D%0A%0D%0AIt is obvious that there are many things a male can do, which is not easily possible for a female and vice versa.%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti E.
