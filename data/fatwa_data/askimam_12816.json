  "answer": "QUESTION\nim chaste Western-christian lady,the man i love & wants 2 marry me is Arab-Muslim.His family wont acept me only because Im not arab & they are afraid it will bring shame to their family. What do I do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is very encouraging to note that whilst you are a western Christian lady, you are also chaste. May your honesty guide you to the ultimate truth- Islam (Ameen). Marriage is a major step in ones life and one should exercise extreme precaution in choosing his/her partner,\n\nYou state you love the Arab Mulism person, but you fear his family will not accept you. This is a legitimate fear as the purpose of marriage could be defeated due to non acceptance from the family. This is more important for you as the possible bad conduct and character of the family members could be wrongly attributed to Islam, thus discouraging you to accept Islam. We advise, the matter be discussed thoroughly before you commit to marriage.\n\nYour marriage to a muslim ought to be a stepping stone to Islam. Therefore your choice should be the most appropriate one.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
