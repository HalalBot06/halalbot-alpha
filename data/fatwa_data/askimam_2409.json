  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ: What is the Shari'ah position on Suicide?%0D%0AA: Allah Ta%E3la, our Creator, has granted us life and sent us to this world%0D%0Ato test our submission to Him. During this test various conditions come upon%0D%0Aa person. Allah Ta%E3la says, \"Do people think We will leave them saying 'we%0D%0Abelieve' and they will not be tested. Verily we have tested the people in%0D%0Athe past so that the truthful are known and the liars are known.\" (Ankaboot%0D%0A2-3).%0D%0AIn another Aayat, Allah Ta%E3la says, \"Verily we will test you with fear,%0D%0Ahunger, and by decrease in wealth, lives and fruits (crops). Glad tidings%0D%0Afor the patient ones who (at the time of adversities) say, \"Verily we belong%0D%0Ato Allah and to Him we return.\" (Baqarah 155 - 156).%0D%0AFurthermore, Allah Ta%E3la has also promised relief after difficulties, He%0D%0Asays, \"Verily with every difficulty there is relief.\" (Nashrah 6 - 7)%0D%0AThe solution to the different frustrations in life is not taking one's life%0D%0Abut to be patient and seek assistance from Allah directly. One should also%0D%0Aask the pious to make Du'a for one. Taking one's life is strictly%0D%0Aprohibited. Such a person will be continuously punished in the hereafter in%0D%0Athe manner he had taken his life. Thus, escaping from one temporary problem,%0D%0Ahe places himself into a permanent problem from where there is no escape.%0D%0ALife is a trust from Allah and such a person who breaches the trust of Allah%0D%0Awill be held in contempt even in this world i.e. the Ulama and leaders of%0D%0Athe community should not attend his Janaaza. The punishment in the Hereafter%0D%0Ais more severe.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
