  "question": "Did the following actually happen or was it dream of Rasullulah ? when the Prophet saw that his Lord put His hand between his shoulders, he honored that place with the extremity of the turban.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan you please explain the following Hadith InShaAllah. Qari and Munawi also quote Ibn al-Qayyim as relating that his sheikh Ibn Taymiyya had told him a beautiful thing, namely, that when the Prophet saw that his Lord put His hand between his shoulders, he honored that place with the extremity of the turban. This is a reference to the hadith in Tirmidhi already quoted whereby the Prophet said: \"My Lord came to me in the best image and asked over what did the angels of the higher heaven vie, and I said I did not know, so He put His hand between my shoulders, and I felt its coolness in my innermost, and the knowledge of all things came to me.\"\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe narration refers to a dream that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) saw.\n\nIt indicates the closeness of Rasulullah Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam to Allah Ta?ala, and that he was favoured which such gifts that no other creation was favoured with. Rasulullah Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam was also granted a vast amount of knowledge, but this does not mean that he has absolute and complete knowledge of all things. Allah Ta?ala is the sole possessor of absolute and complete knowledge.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
