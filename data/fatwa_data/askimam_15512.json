  "question": "Is it okay to perform her Salaat with the shoes on...and to swipe the shoes when making subsequent wudhoo.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy sister is handicapped and she must wear a special type of shoes. It is a burden for her to put it on and off. Because she has to make Salaat, she is just leaving out the shoes most of the time. Now she is having other problems like bone\nmalformation due to her not using the shoes regularly.\n\nShe wants to know if it is ok for her\n\n1. to perform her Salaat with the shoes on\n\n2. to swipe the shoes when making subsequent wudhoo.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1.It is permissible for your sister in this specific situation to perform salah with her shoes on, on condition there are no impurities on the shoes.\n\n2.She may treat her shoes like leather socks and make masah on her shoes if she has washed her feet and thereafter wore the shoes. Please note this ruling is specific to her and case and is not a general ruling.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
