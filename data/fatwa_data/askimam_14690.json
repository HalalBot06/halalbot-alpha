  "question": "have been wearing a leather jacket due to the cold weather here in the midwest region of the u.s., I checked the tag on the jacket and it doesn't detail what type of leather",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSalamu alaikum my name is Abdul-Rahman I reverted to Islam earlier this year Alhamdulillah.  I have a few questions I wish to ask you.\n\n1)  I have been wearing a leather jacket due to the cold weather here in the midwest region of the u.s., I checked the tag on the jacket and it doesn't detail what type of leather it is, it just says its made of 100% leather.  I purchased the jacket years ago and I'm not sure of any number to call to check what type of leather it is.  My parents who are catholic, and thus they consume pork and other haram things, told me not to worry because all leather jackets are made of cow leather.  So is wearing this leather jacket halal or haram?\n\n2)  I'm in college and I'm taking numerous courses.  I was wondering about the subject matter of some courses.  I'm taking a roman philosophy course and in this course we read some books of roman mythology.  I found this very interesting as I was raised a roman catholic and found the truth of Islam Alhamdulillah.  But these roman mythology stories we had to read contained stories of tons of gods that had sexual relationships, drank alcohol, ate food, made war with each other, and had wives and childre, etc.  But the good part of reading these it has shown me how these same roman people reading these roman mythology books and worshipping the roman emperor could then turn around and believe Paul's lies about the trinity.  So is studying this alright.  Also in the same course were have been discussing the sexual lifestyles of the roman empire is this okay?  I know in some colleges in the u.s. they have courses about the history of pornography, part of these courses involves viewing pornography, would a Muslim be allowed to take one of these courses in a purely educational setting.  I have NO plans of ever taking a course like this I was just wondering what the verdict would be.\n\n3)  Being in a mixed gender college in the u.s. I have to interact with females and I have talked in depth with some females, in one course their is a female I find very attractive and talked with regularly, I find myself having sexual thoughts regarding her as she dress in provocative western style clothing, is talking to this girl okay.  A minimum amount of talking is necessary as class requires it, as we have group work, etc.  But we've talked about other things like about or lives and stuff.  Whats your verdict.\n\n4) I really wish to be married but I'm only 19 years old and my parents say that I must graduate, and get a job, and a home before I marry.  My parents who again are catholic, tell me that I should date and have girlfriends, they don't understand why I want to marry a girl soon and not go through the whole western style dating and pre-martial relationship thing.  I wish I could marry soon Insha Allah I will.\n\n5) I've had recent problems with having to urine lots and having lots of urine drops, I've been keeping toilet paper wrapped inside my boxers to keep any drops of urine away.  Alhamdulillah I have not had any drops yet and Insha Allah I will not, is praying with this toilet paper in my boxers for protection acceptable.  Thank you.\n\nSalamu alaikum\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram Brother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\n \n\nIf you are inclined to believe that the leather jacket is not from pig skin, then you may wear it.\nIt is permissible to study Roman philosophy. You should use the information of this to guide people to the truth. It is not permissible to study pornography.\nIslam prohibits free intermingling with the opposite gender. It is human nature to be sexually attracted to a person of ones choice of the opposite gender. That may lead to some immoral act and would dirty ones mind and heart. Islam emphasises on chastity and purity of the heart.\nYour attitude is correct. Do not engage in any pre maritial relationship with a girl. This religious prohibition is full of many wisdoms. A brief glimpse of those who are engaged in such a relationship will reveal to you the selfish and evil instincts of a human being. There is no commitment for life. It is about stay, enjoy and see. The female is dumped, worse she is abused after submitting herself to a charming man based on her feminine instincts. At times a male too is dumped often for not succumbing to the demands of a demanding woman. The world all over is filled with this. Study the statistics of marriages and divorces after dating. One is spared of all this through a formal marriage and a sincere life long commitment. Your parents are Catholics. They should at least have respect for the chastity of Mary (Mariam). She did not have any contact with any man. If she did, how one would be convinced of the miraculous birth of Jesus (Essa)? Read the chapter of Mary in the Quran and explain that to your parents.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
