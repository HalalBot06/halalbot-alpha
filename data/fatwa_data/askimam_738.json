  "answer": "QUESTION\nIhave difficulties in reaching certain things in the kitchen and cry so much. I think that men looking for wives want tall women who can reach things. I face so many difficulties in life as I have to wear high heels and my feet also ache with pain.is it okay to pray to Allah about this and ask Allah to make me taller.its not that I want to enjoy life,its just that I need to pray for this because Iface things in everyday life including humiliation,suffering and pain just because of my height.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe are the creation of Allah and should therefore be thankful that he has\nmade us human beings. What if we were another creature, for example, a dog\nor pig?\n\nFurthermore, our type of gender, male or female, tall being and short, etc.\nare chosen by Allah for which we should be content. What if we did not have\neyes, legs, etc.? Your difficulties of reaching are also rewarded by Allah,\ntherefore, you should be grateful.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
