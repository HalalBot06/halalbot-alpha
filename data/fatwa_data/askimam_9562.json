However, you may continue living there if you are living with a Mahram. Thereafter, there are certain steps which you may follow and, Insha Allah, Allah will grant you a good husband. Make Mashura with your parents or some close relatives and express to them your desire to marry. Ask them to try and find a suitable partner for you. %0D%0A%0D%0AMeanwhile, you should recite Salatul Haajat and engage in sincere Du?aa asking Allah to fulfil your needs. Also, try and keep as many fasts as possible. Indeed, it is from amongst the fundamental belief of a Muslim that he believes in Taqdeer (destiny) ? that what is meant for a person will most certainly be granted to that person. Also, keep up those spirits of fighting those evil thoughts and desires that are the handiwork of Shaytaan and the Nafs (innerself). Do not let Shaytaan and Nafs overpower you and mislead you to committing evil.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta?ala make it easy for you and may he grant you a suitable partner asap, Insha Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
