  "question": "Is it proper to be burried in a non-Muslim cemetery?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nA sister muslima living in america had it on her will that her body should not be transported to her home country if she dies here. She found out later that the city she lives in, does not have a Muslim cemetery. They bury in a portion of a non-Muslim cemetery. So now, she wants to know if she should change her will and let her body be transported to her home country or not.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is incorrect to make a bequest for the body to be transported to a\nforeign country to be buried. She may make a request to be buried in any\nlocal muslim cemetery, if possible. If that is not possible, she will be\nexcused for being buried in the non-muslims cemetery.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
