We truly appreciate your help.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTHE LAWS OF THE BEARD AND THE HAIR IN THE LIGHT OF THE AHADITH%0D%0Aby Moulana Fadhlur Rahmaan Saheb%0D%0A%0D%0A3 - PROOF THAT TO KEEP A BEARD IS WAAJIB%0D%0AAll Ulema regard keeping of the beard at least one fist length, as being%0D%0AWaajib or Fardh and trimming it less than this as Haraam on the basis that%0D%0Ait is the nature and disposition blessed upon man by Allaah Ta'aala.%0D%0ASimilarly it was the pattern and practice of all the Ambiyaa%0D%0A(Alaihis%ADSalaam).Nabi (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) has always emphatically%0D%0Acommanded the keeping of the beard. Nabi (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) and%0D%0Ahis blessed Companions also practised upon it. Nabi (Sallallahu alayhi%0D%0Awasallam) abhorred such Kaafirs who shaved their beards. He disliked even%0D%0Alooking at them.%0D%0A%0D%0AAHAADITH%0D%0A%0D%0AIbn Umar (Radhiallahu-anhu) narrates that Nabi (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam)%0D%0Ahas said: \"Oppose the Mushrikeen (idolaters) and lengthen the beard and%0D%0Ashorten the moustache\". [Bukhari Vol 2 pg 875]%0D%0A%0D%0AAbu Hurairah (Radhiallahu-anhu) narrates that Nabi (Sallallahu alayhi%0D%0Awasallam) has said: \"Trim the moustache and lengthen the beard (let the%0D%0Abeard hang). Oppose the fire worshippers\". [Muslim Vol 1 pg 129 Pakistani%0D%0AEdition]%0D%0A%0D%0AAyesha (Radhiallahu-anha) narrates that Nabi (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam)%0D%0Ahas said: \"Ten things are fitrat (natural). To cut the moustache and%0D%0Alengthen the beard (are from amongst these ten things).\" [Muslim Vol 1 pg%0D%0A129]%0D%0A%0D%0AIbn Abbas (RA) reports from Hadhrat Ayesha (Radhiallahu-anha) narrates that%0D%0ANabi (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) has cursed such men who imitate women and%0D%0Asuch women who imitate men. In one narration it stated that such people%0D%0Ashould be thrown out of their houses. [Bukhari Vol 2 pg 874]%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the above narrations the Mujtahideen and Fuqaha have decreed that it is%0D%0Awaajib to keep a beard, because there is a common order mentioned in the%0D%0AHadith proving wujoob (compulsory) and when there is no reason to take any%0D%0Aother meaning. In these Ahaadith there is no other reason, hence it proves%0D%0Awujoob.%0D%0A%0D%0AImaan Nawawi writes in the commentary of Sahih Muslim that the word \"Ifaa\"%0D%0A(as mentioned in the Hadith) means to lengthen. The word \"afoo\" means the%0D%0Asame. It was the habit of the Persians to shave their beards. The shariat%0D%0Ahas forbidden it. [commentary of Sahib Muslim Vole 1 Pg 129]. Thereafter%0D%0AImaan Nawawi (RA) writes five words have been mentioned in the various%0D%0Anarrations. The explanation of all these words are that the beard should be%0D%0Akept in its original form. [Vol 1 pg 129).%0D%0A%0D%0AHafiz ibn Hajar(RA) has also written in the commentary of Sahih Bukhari that%0D%0Athe fire worshipers used to shave the beards and some of them used to trim%0D%0Ait. The Ahaadith has ordered that these ways should be opposed. [Fathul%0D%0ABaari Vol 10 pg 288]%0D%0A%0D%0AAll the Sahaba, Tabieen and pious believers have acted upon this order of%0D%0ANabi (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam). Acting contrary to this order has not%0D%0Abeen recorded. Instead, stern warnings and admonitions have been narrated%0D%0Afor not keeping a beard. Therefore, this command is wajib (compulsory).%0D%0A%0D%0AHadith No. 4 on P.6 indicates that by shaving the beard, amounts to%0D%0Aimitating women, and therefore cursed by Nabi (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam)%0D%0Aand being distanced from the mercy of Allaah. The sin on which a stern%0D%0Awarning is given is regarded as a Major Sin. Thus to shave the beard is also%0D%0Aa major sin, and the person who commits a major sin is faasiq (i.e. being%0D%0Aoutside the bounds of Allaah's orders and obedience). The Imaamat and Azaan%0D%0Aof a Faasiq is Makrooh, similarly a faasiq's testification and evidence is%0D%0Arejected. Therefore the Muftis have passed the ruling of wujoob for keeping%0D%0Aa beard. (May Allaah save all the Muslims from this curse).%0D%0A%0D%0AAN INSTANCE OF NABI (SALLALLAAHU ALYHI WASALLAM'S) ABHORRENCE FOR THE%0D%0ASHAVING OF THE BEARD%0D%0A%0D%0AHafiz Ibn Katheer(RA) has quoted an incident in his book, Al Bidayah wa%0D%0ANihaya, that Bazaan, a minister of the king of Persia (Kisra) sent two men%0D%0Ato capture Nabi (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) (May Allaah forbid). When two%0D%0Amen came, Nabi (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) disliked to even look at them as%0D%0Atheir beards were shaven and their moustaches long. Nabi (Sallallahu alayhi%0D%0Awasallam) asked them: \"Who ordered you to do this (i.e. shave your beards%0D%0Aand keep your moustaches long)\". They replied: \"Our Rabb, Kisra (King of%0D%0APersia)\". Upon this Nabi (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) replied: \"But My Rabb%0D%0Aordered me to lengthen my beard and cut my moustache.\" [Al Bidayah wa Nihaya%0D%0AVol.1 pg 270]%0D%0A%0D%0AThis incident has been quoted in many books%0D%0A%0D%0ANote: Nabi (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) objected to their actions although%0D%0Athey were Kaafirs, and even disliked looking at them. Hence, one can%0D%0Aimagine how unpleased and unhappy Nabi (Sallallahu alayhi wasallain) will be%0D%0Aif an Ummati of his who claims to have love for him, shaves the beard. One%0D%0Aof the three questions that will be asked in the grave \"What have you to say%0D%0Aregarding this person\". According to some Ulema the blessed face of Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) will be presented when this question will be%0D%0Aasked. How will a person who shaves his beard face Nabi (Sallallahu alayhi%0D%0Awasallam). What a great deprivation will it be if Nabi (Sallallahu alayhi%0D%0Awasallam) has to turn his face away because of his unhappiness and dislike.%0D%0ASimilarly on the plains of reckoning also a person will come in front of%0D%0ANabi (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) for intersession. What answer will a%0D%0Aperson have to offer if Nabi (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) has to ask that%0D%0Ayou neglected my way and chose the ways of my enemies, the Kuffaar and the%0D%0AMushrikeen?\"%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allaah Ta'aala grant us the ability to repent sincerely and conform to%0D%0Athe Sunnat of Nabi (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0AMany sins are such that a person only remains a sinner while he is involved%0D%0Ain that particular sin e.g. adultery - homosexuality %ADdrinking - lying -%0D%0Astealing etc. When he stops doing so, then the sin also comes to an end.%0D%0ATrimming or shaving of the beard on the other hand is such a sin that until%0D%0Aa person does not repent and start keeping a Shari Beard, he will remain a%0D%0Aperpetual sinner. He will be regarded as a sinner even whilst sleeping or%0D%0Aeating and even whilst performing Ibaadat. This increases the seriousness of%0D%0Athis sin. At the time of Ibaadat, just as Nabi (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam)%0D%0Aabhorred it, similarly if Allaah Ta'aala does not focus the level of%0D%0Aacceptance on the person, then his Ibaadat will not reach the level of%0D%0Aacceptance. Then ponder and think what will be that person's condition in%0D%0Athe Aakhiraat (Hereafter)!%0D%0A%0D%0AAN INTERESTING INCIDENT%0D%0A%0D%0AMirza Qateel was a Persian poet of the past who rendered many poems on%0D%0AMarifat (Recognition -of Allaah) and wisdom (Hikmat). An Iranian, after%0D%0Areading Qateel's poems, became his ardent follower and finally came to meet%0D%0Ahim, expecting him to be a very pious person. When the Iranian person came,%0D%0Ahe saw the poet shaving his beard. Surprised, he asked \"You are shaving your%0D%0Abeard?\" Qateel replied: \"Yes I am shaving my beard but I am not hurting%0D%0Aanyone's heart\". Upon this the person immediately said: \"Why not, you are%0D%0Ahurting Nabi (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam's) heart\". Hearing this the poet%0D%0Afell unconscious. After regaining consciousness he recited a Persian couplet%0D%0Awhich means:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"Thanks to you, for opening my eyes and making me understand\"."
