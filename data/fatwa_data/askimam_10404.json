  "question": "I had a dream that i was to marry a women that i knew from school,after this dream i think i have fallen in love with her,am i destined to marry her,is there a dua that i can read?also the meaning",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream is a Shaytaani one. The Shaytaan has whispered (waswasa) of evil in you and that had led to your illicit and Haraam relationship with the girl.\n\nYou should terminate your relationship with her and make Tawbah (repent) and Istighfaar (seek forgiveness). If you love the girl, discuss the matter with your seniors and consider marrying her. If you cannot do that, then do not have anything to do with her. Nobody can predict anyone?s destiny. That is known only to Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
