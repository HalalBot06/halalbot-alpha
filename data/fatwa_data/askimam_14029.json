  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome people forgets to put off their mobiles in mosques as a result during namaz mobile starts ringing which some time have singing tones which causes serious disturbance & trouble to all namazis my question is that are we allowed to break namaz  to put off the  mobile as sometimes it is impossible to put off mobile without breaking namaz.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nOne should ensure that his cellphone is completely switched off before Salaat. however, if ones mobile goes off while performing Salaah, he/she should try to switch it off in Salaah. However, it is important that in trying to off the phone your actions do not constitute Amal Katheer. Amal Katheer is doing an act in Salaah where an outsider will consider you not to be in Salaah. If Amal Katheer takes place, the Salaah will become invalid. Therefore, one should try and use one hand in a swift and appropriate manner to avoid the Salaah becoming invalid.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
