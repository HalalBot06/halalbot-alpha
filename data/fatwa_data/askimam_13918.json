  "question": "How should I go about making up these missed prayers. Since I dont know when I stopped reading",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a question concerning specifically my qadhaa salah. When i was really yound (in 6th grade or around that time) I used to miss my salah. I was above the age of puberty at this time.\n\n1. I do not know when I started missing salah and when I learned my lesson and started reading it. Also I remember that some days I would actually read my salah during this period of foolishness. I want to know, how am I supposed to make up these prayers when I dont know for how long  I missed my prayers and when I started reading my prayers.\n\n2. Also, I read salatul rawatib. Should I stop reading all my nafl AND SUNNAH salah and just focus on making up all my fardh prayers that I missed or should I continue reading these prayers.\n\n3. Am I supposed to make up the witr salah that I have missed.\n\n4. How should I go about making up these missed prayers. Since I dont know when I stopped reading and when I started reading I'm fearful that I will fall short of making up all the salah I've missed. Please advise.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. It is Fardh to perform Salaat from the age of puberty. One should estimate the amount of Salaats that were missed since this time and make the intention that this is the first Fajr Salaat that is on my head. One should say the same thing for all Salaats and one should always say the first of this Salaat on my head.\n\n2. One will still have to perform the Sunnat-e-Muakkadah Salaats. However, the Nafl and Sunnat-e-Ghayr Muakkadah can be substituted and with the Qadhaa Salaat.\n\n3. Witr is Waajib and Qadhaa of it has to be made.\n\n4. One should estimate the amount of Salaats missed and make du’aa to Allah that one has done the best he/she can do, Allah must forgive him/her if there were any shortcomings in his/her estimation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
