  "question": "How can I control my anger?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have this problem,its my anger. When i get onto Islamic chat sites,the Kufar come on and say bad about Islam (you dont want to know what they say because its disgusting)but i get so angry that i say everything back about their religion(for example, to a hindu who came on and said bad about islam and Allah,i said to him that what they worship is not even worthy of worship because it doesnt not respond,and i also said their statues will fight them in hell).My fellow muslim brothers and sisters said i should calm down and behave respectifully to them and not show anger.I usually get fustrated easily, i shout at my sisters at home often,when i see something is not going my way,i get angry again+go mad.Is there a duwa which can help me through this.Please advise.Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Do not get angry and you will\nreceive Jannah.'\n\nHe also advised that if one is angry and is standing, he/she should sit down\nand if he/she is sitting he/she should lie down and if he/she is lying down,\nhe/she should make Wudhu.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
