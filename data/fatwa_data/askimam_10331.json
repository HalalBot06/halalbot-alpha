  "question": "Why do Hanafi and Shafi Madhab have different Salaah timetables? Would'nt sunset in Jhb, SA, for E.g. be the same whether you are Hanafi or Shafi?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Hanafi and Shaafi?ee times reflected on Salaat timetables are generally for the commencing time of Asr Salaat.\n\nAccording to Imaam Abu Hanifa, the terminating time for Dhuhr Salaat is when the shadow of any object reaches twice its length excluding the shadow during midday. That is when Asr Salaat sets in. According to the majority Imaams, that includes Imaam Shaafi?ee (RA), the terminating time for Dhuhr Salaat is when the shadow of any object reaches one length excluding the shadow at midday. That is when the time for Asr Salaat sets in. According to Imaam Abu Hanifa (RA), that is still time for Dhuhr Salaat.\n\nThe different times on the timetable assists one to perform Salaat timeously according to his Madhab.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
