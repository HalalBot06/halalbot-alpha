It is for this reason that the Shari?ah has stipulated the testimony of two upright men or one man and two women in order to prove the validity of Radhaa?at. In your case there is only one person claiming that your mother breastfed your wife and your mother refutes this statement, as a result Radhaa?at has not been established due to insufficient proof. The statement made by the person who informed you, will not affect your marriage in any way. If the stipulated amount of witnesses is found, then it will be incumbent upon you to break off marriage ties with your wife. You have all the right to further investigate the matter. May Allah make you a true Daa?ee.%0D%0A(Raddul Muhtaar, Vol. 4, Page 420.
