  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it allowed if a persons feet point towards the Kabba when they sleep? I know that you are not allowed to face towards Makkah when you go to the toilet, i have recently been told that i cant sleep with my feet pointing towards the way we pray. Please could you base your answer on hadiths on this matter. Jazakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAllah Ta'ala says in the Quran:\n\nمن يعظم شعائر الله فإنها من تقوى القلوب\n\n\"If one observes the sanctity of the symbols of Allah, then such things emanate from the piety of the hearts.\"(22:32)\n\nThe Qibla (direction of the Ka'bah) is considered to be one of the Sha'air (symbols) of Allah Ta'ala. Therefore, the Qibla should be respected. Stretching one's legs and spreading one's feet before others is considered a sign of disrespect. The Qibla is the direction facing towards the Ka'bah, which is the most sacred site for Muslims. Praying towards the Qibla is one of the distinct signs of a Muslim with which Allah Ta'ala blessed and bestowed on this Ummah.\n\n \n\nIt is Makruh (disliked) to point the feet towards Qibla while sleeping.    \n\n \n\nيكره مد الرجلين إلى القبلة في النوم وغيره عمدا\n\n(Raddul Muhtar, Vol. 1, P. 341, H.M.
