  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease tell us wheather it is permissible for us to eat a gift given such as food etc from a nonmuslim on the ocassion of any parties etc etc\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAt the outset, one should not attend parties of non-Muslims because of all the evil which goes along with it. If one did not attend the party and was sent a gift for him, it will be permissible to accept the gift. If the gift is a consumable item and all the ingredients are halal, then it will be permissible to consume it. \n\nمجموعة الفتاوى 2/298\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Ishaq E.
