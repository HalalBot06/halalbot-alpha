  "question": "99 names whilst exercising?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni would like to find out if reciting the 99names of Allah is permissible whilst exercising.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh  \n\nThe reciting of the 99 names of Allah Ta’ala is also a form of zikr. Allah Ta’ala praises those who engage themselves in zikr at all times. Allah Ta’ala mentions in the holy Quran:\n\n \n\nالذين يذكرون الله قياما وقعودا وعلى جنوبهم ويتفكرون في خلق السماوات والأرض \n\nwho remember Allah standing and sitting, and (lying) on their sides, and ponder on the creation of the heavens and the earth\n\n(Verse: 3:191)\n\n \n\nAllah Ta’ala mentions these words whilst explaining the qualities of the wise ones. One explanation given to this verse is that it refers to those people who remember Allah Ta’ala and make his zikr at all times.\n\n \n\nIt is understood from the above mentioned that it is permissible, but rather virtuous to remember Allah Ta’ala when doing any action, be it exercising, or working in the office, driving, etc. However, the integrity and the sanctity of the name of Allah demands that it should be taken with utmost respect. Therefore, one should avoid making zikr verbally when doing vigorous exercises or when present in an improper environment, as is the environment in many of the gymnasiums today. In such situations, it is advisable to remember Allah Ta’ala in the heart. Similarly, the reciting of the 99 names should not be a subordinate to the exercise; e.g. reciting it as a mere measure to complete the exercise, etc. On the other hand, if one is doing some light exercise, like walking, etc, and the environment is also appropriate, then it would be permissible, but rather virtuous to engage in the zikr of Allah Ta’ala verbally.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
