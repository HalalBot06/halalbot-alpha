  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI currently got a job with a collections agency for a bank. My job requires me to just call our clients and to remind them to pay the monthly installment that is owed on their accounts. But some of these are passed due date or have been charged interest. I do not personally collect the money. All I do is remind them to make their payments. I was wondering if this job would be classified as haraam or not? And if yes, should I get rid of my earnings that I have made from there.\n\nAlso, I’d like to know if we are allowed to think that if something bad happens to us, such as falling ill or missing salaat, that’s because we are committing too many sins and that we are being punished by Allah (swt) for it or because of a weakening of our hearts?\n\nI appreciate your time and  I look forward to your response inshAllah. May Allah give us all hidayat to better our imaans and to please Him.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\n \n\n1. Your job requires you to call clients and remind them of their monthly instalments. This is fine and permissible.\n\n \n\nAt times, you are required to call clients that have been charged interest. Calling such clients is permissible, though reprehensible.\n\n \n\nThe client has already committed the sin of interest. You are advising him to pay his account, as to avoid more interest in the future. You are not assisting in the actual sin of interest, as the transaction of interest has already taken place.\n\n \n\nHowever, it is reprehensible to make such calls, as you may be assisting the bank in collecting its interest monies. \n\n \n\nHence, the income of such a job cannot be classified as Harām. However, seek a better job.\n\n \n\n2. Yes, we are afflicted with difficulties and bad, due to sinning. Allah Ta’ala states in the Qurān:\n\n \n\nCalamities have appeared on land and sea because of what the hands of the people have earned, so that He (Allah) makes them taste some of what they did, in order that they may return (to the right way). [30:41]\n\n \n\nHowever, this is not a general principle. At times, difficulties earn us reward and expiate our sins. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) has stated:\n\n \n\n“There is no difficulty that afflicts a Believer, even the prick of a thorn, except that Allah Ta’ala writes in his favour reward and forgives him”(Sahih Muslim)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
