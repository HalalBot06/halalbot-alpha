  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If you have parents, they will inherit from your sister's (daughters)\nestate. The mother will inherit 1/6 and your father will inherit the\nremainder of the estate. The brother and sisters will not inherit. You will\nreceive only as bequest to the maximum of 1/3 of her estate.\n2. If you do not have parents, then your sister's estate will be divided\ninto 3 equal shares. Two for the brother and one for you.\n\nThe above is according to our understanding that the one sister referred to\nhave passed away.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
