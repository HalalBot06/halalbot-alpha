  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI was wondering if you could briefly discuss the history around the revelation of SURAH FATEHA, is it formatted such that ALLAH  TA'ALA in his infinite mercy was showing us a way to supplicate towards him?\n\nreason: i read on certain website that a christian questined the verses: YOU ALONE WE WORSHIP, YOU ALONE WE ASK FOR HELP\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIndeed Suratul-Faatiha is a very great and virtuous surah. It is reported in Bukhari that Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said that surah Faatiha is the greatest surah in the Qur’aan. (Vol 2, pg 642)\n\nIt is reported in Tirmidhi that Nabi (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said, “By Allah! Such a surah (Al-Faatiha) had not been revealed in the Torah, nor in the Injeel, nor in the Zaboor, nor in the Qur’aan (equal to surah Faatiha)”.\n\nSurah Faatiha was the first surah to be revealed in its complete form at once. Allah mentiones in surah Hijr, “We have granted you seven verses that are often repeated, and the Glorious Qur’aan”.\n\nImam Bukhari (RA) writes that surah Faatiha is called Ummul Kitaab because it is written at the beginning of all manuscripts of the Qur’aan and because salaah begins with its recitation.\n\nAnother name for surah Faatiha is “Shaafiyah” i.e. the curer. Just as the words spiritually heal the heart of a believer, it also heals the physical body.\n\nHazrat Anas (RA) reports that Nabi (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said, “When any of you lies down to rest at night, if he recites Faatihatul-Kitaab (surah Faatiha) and surah Ikhlaas (Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad), then he will be safe from everything besides death”.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nReayhaan,\nStudent 6th Year\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
