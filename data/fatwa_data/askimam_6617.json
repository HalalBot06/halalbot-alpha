  "question": "Referring to Question 4540 Marriage to a girl whose father is a banker. If I am married then how to deal with it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf I am already married to a girl whose father is a banker, then how to deal with the relation, like visiting inlaws house, eating from their house, accepting gifts from them and all these. Do, I need to avoid those or is there any way that I can accept those.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, it is not permissible for a person to work in a commercial\nbank and actively engage in any Haraam transaction. For example, doing an\ninterest bearing deal. The income from such an amployment is not\npermissible.\n\nIf a person is not directly engaged in any Haraam transaction, for example,\nan accountant at a bank recording the transaction that had taken place, then\ntoo he should not work there. However, the income due to his accounting\nservices will not be Haraam. We also wish to point out that apart from the\nabove general principle, one must take into cognizance his relationship with\npeople especially relatives. To maintain family ties is Fardh and to break\nfamily ties is Haraam and emphasized injunction of Shari'ah. One must be\nprudent in abstaining from Haraam in a way that does not lead him to commit\nanother Haraam act.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
