  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is the ruling when a women has yellow discharge for 10 days and nights and then begins to bleed or if it happens for 9 days and nights and then she begins to bleed?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe ten days yellow discharge will regarded as Haydh (menses). If the yellow discharge is nine days and there is bleeding from the tenth day, then too the haydh will be ten days from the time of the yellow discharge. The bleeding after ten days of the yellow discharge and one day bleeding will be istihaadha.\n\nThe woman should make wudhu for each Fardh Salaat and perform her Salaat. The wudhu will be valid for everything, Sunnah Salaat, Nafl Salaat and tilaawat of the Qur’aan. The Wudhu will be invalidated upon the expiry of the Salaat time and will have to be renewed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
