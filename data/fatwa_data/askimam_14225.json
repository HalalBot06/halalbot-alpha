  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy wife has gold jewellery.I am aware that zakaat has to be paid on the Gold.She does not have income of her own and the spending I give her is been utilised on necessity expenses.I as a husband should pay Zakaat on that jewellery owned by my wife?or should my wife save money from the spending I give her and pay Zakaat with that money or is it permissible for me to pay the zakaat on her behalf?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf your wife has gold of 87.48 grams and more and she does not have a liability which is equivalent or more than the value of 87.48 grams of gold, then she has to give Zakaat on her gold jewellery. Your wife could save the money given to her or you could offer to give Zakaat on her bahelf with her consent. You cannot give Zakaat on her behalf without her consent.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
