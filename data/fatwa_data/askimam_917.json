  "answer": "QUESTION\nNow I understand what Sufism is but Sufism Teaching is only for muslims? Is Sufism available for many people or only for muslims?, Sufisms teaching seems to me very diferent from Islamic Teachings. Why it is so diferent?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSufism is a process of spiritual upliftment. It is a way of reforming oneself and attaining closeness to Allah Ta?ala. Spiritual upliftment, reformation and attaining closeness to Allah are orders replete in the Qur?aan.\n\nIf it is possible for any individual to reform himself, he should do so. However, it is generally noticed that individuals experience difficulties in reforming themselves and seek assistance of a spiritual guide who is pious and adhere to Shari?ah in reforming themselves. The practise of taking allegiance (Bay?at) and following the guidance of one?s spiritual mentor is called Sufism.\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
