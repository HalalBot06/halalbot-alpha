  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nas far as i know Zakat is due on the amount which is in excess for more then a year.\nI've given zakat in last Ramdan for the first time on my savings let say Rs. 10,000, after that i've switched the job and during this year i've saved little amount regularly every month let say Rs. 3000. now I have Rs 10,000 Rs (3000 * 12) which is equal to Rs 46,000/-.\n\nMy question is that on which amount i've to pay the zakat i.e either on Rs 10,000 or on whole Rs 46,000. As the amount saved during the last year have not completed oneÂ year.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe principle is you consider the cash on hand at the end of your Zakaat year and pay 2.5% on the surplus amount after deducting your liabilities. If you discharged Zakaat of Rs10,000 last Ramadhaan and during the next Ramadhaan, you have a surplus of Rs36000, you will now discharge Zakaat of Rs46,000 at 2.5%\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
