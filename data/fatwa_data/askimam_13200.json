  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nhow far do we take the verse 'wa huwa alaa kulli shayin qadeer' (and allah is powerful over all things.) does allah's powers have any limits .what is the deobandi stance on imkaane kizb. can i have a detail answere to the following. i believe allah has the to do what ever he wants but with his free will wont do anything bad such as lying is this aqeedah right.  Brealwis claim that lying is a defect and allah is free from defects so its IMPOSSIBILE for him to lie however doesnt this neglate allahs powers. \n\njazakallah\n\nwasaaam\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nBefore responding to your question, allow me to enlighten you about our limited intelligence. The human mind is restricted and it is unable to grasp the boundless divine attributes of Allah.\n\nSo, when you question his divine attributes, you are basing your objections upon ‘your own limited understanding’ of something that is boundless. You are judging the Creator through the lens of the creation. Nonetheless, the verse you refer to should be viewed within the context of its revelation. It refers to His Omnipotence and absolute power over the entire creation. It does not allude to absurd connotations fabricated by the deficient human mind.\n\nLying is evil and the Being of Allah is devoid of such deficiency. I urge you to refrain from dabbling in such issues. Rather focus your attention towards more important issues.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
