  "question": "I wanted to asked about what a dream I had 3 times meant?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI dreamt of a holy man(Islamic clothing and a long beard) showing me 2 doors. One which he opened and it was a beautiful sight and the other door when he opened it was hell fire. On the first dream he had told me I am to go in to the good door and the second dream he told me why do you keep going to the other door(that has hell fire).Well what was happening in my life during those dreams was that I wanted a divorce(my husband was arabic but did not pray and owned a beer and wine store) I have tried many times to help him in the right path but he doesn't listen. And so then I decide to get a divorce. But every time I am about to go to the Imam and get the kulla my parents try to change my mind. But when I final went to the Imam to get the divorce. I had the same dream and the holy man tell me now I shall go into the good door. I was wondering that maybe when the man keep telling me to go into the good door that he meant getting this divorce because this man wasn't a real muslim? please tell me what this dream means\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou should exercise precaution in making a major decision of divorce. It is\nirresponsible to base a decision on a simple dream as that could be a\nreflection of your thoughts of leaving the marriage.\n\nWe advise you exercise precaution and make Istikhaara (seek Divine guidance)\nbefore deciding any further.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
