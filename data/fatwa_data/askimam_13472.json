  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ncould you plz tell me what a tabieen is? i would also like to ask in islam are women allowed to shave their pubic hair as some scholars say you do where as otheres say you dont.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nA Taabi’ee is one who met a Sahaabi [radhiallaahu anhu] in the state of Imaan and thereafter passed away as a believer.\n\nIt is compulsory for women to remove both the pubic hair and the hair under the armpits. One will be sinful if it is left for more than 40 days. (Hindiyyah vol.5 pg.437; Beirut). The view of the impermissibility for women to shave pubic hair is erroneous.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
