  "question": "Do looking at girls and getting kicked from Islam destroy fast completely?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAlsalamu alaykum warahmat Allah wabrakatahu I am fasting a voIuntary month because I promised Allah I would if he accepted a dua which I believe he did. I've fasted about half of the month but only can despair for a few reasons: at school many girls are very attractive and aren't well dressed,and I' ve often have bad kaffir thoughts. I know a thought doesn't kick you from Islam, but for me it seems different. I've asked other Muslims about them having thoughts like that and they said yes, but I know it's not like me. I may fast another month to make this up. 1.If I look at girls, which I refrain from as much as Allah wills, will it cancel my fast or will it lower its value? 2.If I do get kicked from Islam and make shahadah while fasting, does the fast still get cancelled? 3.I think I may have gotten confused making the niyat when I said (in my head) the 13th day and it was really the 14th, and vice versa: does this destroy the fast, and my month? Im sorry for too many questions. May Allah reward you. Thank you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Haraam (strictly prohibited) to cast a lustful glance on a female. It is a major sin and destroys one?s spirituality. The heart is now filled with the excitement of different forms and shapes, instead of the closeness and greatness of Allah being in the heart.\n\nYou should continue striving to control your gazes. However, that does not invalidate one?s Islam or fast. The confusion in the intention also does not invalidate the fast.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
