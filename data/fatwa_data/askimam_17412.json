  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\n                                           I have a few questions that I would like to know the answers to in the light of quran and hadith.\n\nQ1- Is there any DUA mentioned by our Prophet (SAW) for a deep and un-interrupted sleep at night?\n\nQ2- Is there any DUA which i can recite to gain success in my work life, travelling plans and just life in general?\n\nQ3- Is it permissible or acceptable for me to wrap a small black cloth any where outside the car to avoid accidents and bad omens. Is this act propper in accordance to Islam?\n\nI will greatly appriciate your help if you can provide me with the answers as soon as possible. May Allah (SWT) reward you for this kind act.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1.      We are unaware of a specific du‘ā for a deep uninterrupted sleep; however, there are other various practices in accordance to the Sunnah of Rasūlullah صلى الله عليه و سلم that one should implement before sleeping such as,\n\na.       Performing a fresh wudhū’ before sleeping\n\nb.      Brushing the teeth with Miswak\n\nc.       Reciting the Tasbīh al-Fātimī (33 times Subhānallah, 33 times Alhamdulillah and 34 times Allahu Akbar)\n\nd.      Reciting Ayat al-Kursi\n\ne.       Reciting Surahs Kāfirūn, Ikhlās, Falaq and Nās then blowing over one’s whole body (repeat three times).\n\nf.       Lie on your right side with your right hand placed under your cheek\n\ng.      Recite the following du‘ās;\n\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ وَضَعْتُ جَنْبِى اللَّهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِى ذَنْبِى وَأَخْسِئْ شَيْطَانِى وَفُكَّ رِهَانِى وَاجْعَلْنِى فِى النَّدِىِّ الأَعْلَى\n\n“With Allah’s name have I laid my body to rest. O Allah, forgive my sins and drive away my Shaytān from me and free my neck of all responsibilities and let my scale of deeds become heavy and include me amongst the exalted people.”\n\n \n\nاللهم باسمك أموت وأحيا\n\n“O Allah, with your name I die and live.”     \n\n \n\n2.      There are many different du‘ās to recites for different aspects of one’s life. We recommend that you obtain a copy of a book that comprises of Masnūn du‘ās such as Al-Hisn al-Hasīn. Such books are easily obtainable from Islamic book stores. You will find many relevant du‘ās to recite therein.\n\n3.      It will not be permissible to wrap or tie a black cloth, string or any other type of amulet etc on your car, house etc to avoid accidents and bad omens because such items do not have any power or intrinsic capabilities to ward off any harm. By performing such actions, a person’s Aqā’id (beliefs) will become corrupted.Allah is the only one who causes and repels harm. Therefore, you should place your trust in Him and pray to Him for protection. There are many verses and du‘ās a person can recite for protection which indirectly teach the believers to place their belief and conviction on Allah as opposed to pieces of thread and fabric.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nMl.
