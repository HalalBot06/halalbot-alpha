  "answer": "QUESTION\nAfter I pray istekhara Salat and Du'a can I have humbistar with my wife.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe purpose of Istikhaara is to seek guidance from Allah. That requires one to be in a condition that invokes the mercy of Allah upon the individual.\n\nIt is important to be focussed towards Allah with purity of heart and soul. Physical purity is also important. To be engaged in a conjugal relationship with one?s wife when making Istikhaara is against the etiquettes of Istikhaara.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
