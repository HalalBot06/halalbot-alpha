  "question": "question about backbiting and divorce",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu alaikum I am divorcing my wife. At our mesjid, people have asked me why I am divorcing her. It is because she committed adultery. I don?t want anyone to think that I am divorcing her without good reason, but I also don?t want to engage in backbiting. Can I tell people who ask me why I am divorcing her that it is because she committed adultery or would that be considered backbiting?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (SAW) said, The worst thing among permissible things is divorce.\nIf it is at all possible to avoid a divorce and address the problem at hand,\nyou should do so. The act of adultery is indeed a heinous act. If your wife\nregrets the act and sincerely repents, then you may consider forgiving her.\nThat attitude may be a turning point in her life as well as invoke Allah's\nmercy and forgiveness for you. Should you divorce her, then you may inform\nonly her seniors and not all and sundry. You may inform people enquiring\nfrom you that you had a Sharee, justifiable reason to divorce her and you\nhad discussed the matter with her seniors. You do not want to engage in\nbackbiting.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
