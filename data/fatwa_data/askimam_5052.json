  "answer": "QUESTION\nit's very hard to explain but i will do my best: every time we are in khourouj, or in djawla, or even the simple fact of me going to the masjid, i have the feeling that i am always sad, stressed, in the sense that i see my life, compared w/ the deen and the greatness of allah, and i cannot help thinking, thinking, in devilish thoughts, and this only happens when am in masjid or khourouj. Also the tarteeb scares me, 40 days, 4 months etc...i dont understand my situation mufti saab, some guidance would be very useful and when i see the people around me who are also involved, they are far happier than i am, i hope you can give some guidance inshallah, barakallahou fiikoum. could it be that it's shaytaan fighting me??\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nEvil thoughts are from Shaytaan and is a sign of one's Imaan.\n\nAllah Ta'ala has kept great rewards for those who frequent the Musjid,\nendure hardships in his path. Hence, Shaytaan tries to deprive one from such\nrewards. Therefore, such feelings and thoughts in the mind which will keep\nhim back. Going out for 40 days or 4 months is definitely a great sacrifice,\nwhereby, if a person goes many benefits are opened to him. Allah has blessed\nsuch people with great rewards and merits. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) said, 'Whatever dust particles settles on the person who is out in\nthe path of Allah, the smoke of Jahannum is forbidden to touch that part of\nthe body.' (Muslim)\n\nTherefore, these thoughts should be ignored and supplicate to Allah for His\nassistance.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
