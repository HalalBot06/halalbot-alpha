  "question": "Does the wife of the eldest brother-in-law have to call her husband's younger brother by his name even if he is older than her?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn the indian culture, the Bhabi calls her younger brother-in-law by his name eventhough she may or is younger than they are? And the younger brother-in-law calls his bhabi, who may be younger than her, as Baji or Appa? Does Islam allow this? And is this all cultural? JazakAllah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, we wish to point out that it is not permissible for the brother-in-law to communicate freely with the sister-in-law and vice versa. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Brother-in-law is death (to the sister-in-law).?\n\nHowever, if there is a genuine need to communicate, then they may do so whilst adhering to the laws of Hijaab. In doing so, there is no prohibition in addressing one another with cultural names.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
