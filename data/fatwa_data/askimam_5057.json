  "question": "Salaam: Does it state in the Quran that one should pray 5 times a day? If it does not, then why doesnt it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSince according to one of the pillars of Islam, we must pray 5 times a day without exception or excuse. I know it states Asr, Maghrib and Fajr times but why not explicitly state 5 times a day. Thank you. Salaam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSalaat is one of the most important forms of worship in Islam. It is one of%0D%0Athe 5 pillars. In numerous places in the Qur'aan, Allah Ta'ala consistently%0D%0Areminds us to establish Salaat. It is important for us to understand that it%0D%0Ais not necessary for every single thing in Islam to be established by the%0D%0AQur'aan only. There are four authentic sources from where anything in Islam%0D%0Amust be derived: a) Qur'aan, b) Hadith, c) consensus of the Ulama, and, d)%0D%0AAnalogy.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Qur'aan and Hadith only mentions certain laws and principles from which%0D%0Athe Jurists derive and extract the different laws of the Shari'ah. Can you%0D%0Aimagine how difficult it would have been for one to complete reciting the%0D%0Aentire Qur'aan once if the Qur'aan were to have encompassed every single%0D%0Alittle intricate matter in Islam?%0D%0A%0D%0AWhilst there are indications towards all 5 Salaat in the Qur'aan, our Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has clearly and explicitly mentioned it to us%0D%0Ain his narrations. This is sufficient proof for us to believe and act upon%0D%0Ait. The question of 'why didn't the Qur'aan mention it' can arise in%0D%0Athousands of other issues in Islam. It is, therefore, not practical for the%0D%0AQur'aan to mention every single little thing. This is over and above the%0D%0Afact that Allah Ta'ala in His infinite mercy and wisdom knew exactly why he%0D%0Adid not mention these things.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0Afor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
