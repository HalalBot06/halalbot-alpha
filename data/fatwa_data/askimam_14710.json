  "answer": "QUESTION\n \nAsalamoAlikum Mufit Saab\nI have few questions can you please help me.\n1.  I am male and i live in USA..I know there are hadits that says we shouldn't let our pants hang below the ankels. i dont have my pants above ankles all the time but before pray i fold my pants to make sure they are above the ankels. now i have just learnt that there is also hadit(from sahi msulim )that says we should not change the condition of the clothes when praying namaz. i am very confused now,should i fold my pants or no. i know the optimal thing would be to have pants which length is above the ankel. but i dont have those pants so can you plz tell me would be better to fold or let it hang below ankels.\n2. Is it permisable to wear short sleeves, or do we have to wear long sleeves when we pray. Will namaz be valid in short sleeves?\n3. I have American Eagle shirts. they have eagle symbol/pictures on the shirt. if i wear them and pray would the namaz be valid?\n4. if my body is napak(unclean) and its namaz time and i can't take shower at the moment. can i still pray(with napak body) or i should pray later as a qaza namaz after taking the shower.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram\n\n \n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\nIt is prohibited to have ones garment (trousers, qamees, jubba etc) flow beyond ones ankles.  This is a major sin.  If ones trousers is below ones ankles, he should fold the bottom up to above the ankles at all times, in salaah and out of salaah.  There is no Hadith that prohibits the folding of the trousers above the ankles.  There is another Hadith in which Rasulullah Salalahu Alayhi Wasallam prohibited one from keeping away his trousers from touching the ground.  That is another issue and should not be confused with the prohibition of flowing ones garment below his ankles.\nIt is Makrooh (reprehensible) to wear short sleeves in salaah. \nIt is not permissible to perform salaah with a picture of a bird on ones shirt.\nWhat do you mean by napaak and unclean? Explain why you cannot take a shower?\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\nThe guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\nEducation and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\nIslam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\nWhen one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\nMuslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\nWe have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\nIf you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\nIf that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\nRasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit”.\n\n \n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
