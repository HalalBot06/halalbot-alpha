  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy husband and I have had two in vitro fertilisations .  Both failed. to implant and I could not get pregnant because of health problems.  We managed to freeze some of our embryos  which are from our own genetic material.  The doctor says we should try a surrogate mother to carry our baby using our own embryos .Would this be acceptable islamically ie using a surrogate mother to carry our embryo? It is our last option.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nWe acknowledge your seeking Islamic advice in taking such an important decision in life. We advise you to do the same in all other aspects of life.\n\nShari’a emphasises greatly and enjoins strictly upon the preservation of lineage. Consider the following:\n\n·        Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) is reported to have said:\n\nلا يحل لامرئ يؤمن بالله واليوم الآخر أن يسقى ماءه زرع غيره ( رواه أبو داؤد)\n\nIt is not becoming of a person believes in Allah and in the Hereafter to irrigate another’s field with his water. (Abu Dawood)\n\nHerein, Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) strictly prohibits one from engaging in any intimate relationship with a woman when the effects of her previous husband are present in her.\n\n·        Shari’a enjoins a woman to spend time in iddat (waiting period) after her husband leaves her, before she marries someone else. One reason why this process is adopted is to ensure that the woman is clear of all effects of her previous husband, before she has any intimate relationship with her new husband.\n\nIn the light of the abovementioned, it will not be permissible to use a surrogate mother to carry one’s embryo. Any such procedure will be tantamount to zina (fornication) and the husband and wife will be held sinful in the court of Allah.\n\n \n\n(Jadeed Fiqhi Masail Vol.5 Pg.151 – Kutub Khana Na’eemiya, Deoband)\n\n(Nizam al-Fatawa ol.1 Pg.337 – Rahmaniya, Lahore (Quoted on the footnotes of Fatawa Mahmoodiyah Vol.18 Pg.323 – Jami’a Farooqiya))\n\n \n\nWe understand that it is only a natural demand of a woman to yearn for a child. However, you should not make it a reason for you to become despondent, as being despondent is from the habit of the non-believers. Allah Ta’ala mentions in the Holy Quran:\n\nولا تيئسوا من روح الله إنه لا ييئس من روح الله إلا القوم الكافرون\n\nAnd do not lose hope in the mercy of Allah. In fact, only the infidels lose hope in Allah‘s mercy.(Verse: 12:87)\n\nYou should rather exercise patience and make your situation a reason to draw from the bounties of Allah Ta’ala and attain closeness to Allah Ta’ala. Allah Ta’ala mentions in the Holy Quran:\n\nإنما يوفى الصابرون أجرهم بغير حساب\n\nCertainly those who observe patience will be given their reward in full without measure.\n\n(Verse: 39:10)\n\nيا أيها الذين آمنوا استعينوا بالصبر والصلاة إن الله مع الصابرين\n\nO you who believe, seek help through patience and prayer. Surely, Allah is with those who are patient. (Verse: 2:153)\n\n \n\nMoreover, Islam caters for those who cannot have their own children and permits Muslims to adopt a child.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
