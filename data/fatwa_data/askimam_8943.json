  "question": "does one feel time go by in the after life whether in heaven or hell? for example would i feel 20 years go by in heaven? or would it be different?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe reality of the hereafter cannot be justly explained by any person living in this world. It suffices to say that in the aspect of time, there will be a world of difference.\n\nThe day of judgment alone which in reality will only be one day, yet the Qur?aan tells us that it will be 50 000 years long. Various Ahaadith show us about how a dweller of Jannat will stand and merely admire the doors of his palace in Jannat for hundreds of years. In short, for a righteous person, there will be no track of time. He will not feel bored or tired, neither will he have to wait for anything.\n\nYes, for those who led a life of disobedience and will be punished by Allah, every second will be felt by them. They will really feel the time and wish and hope that the time could elapse quickly so that they could be freed from punishment.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
