  "question": "Touching Quran without 'wudu'...my muslim friend who is very pious said to me that we should not give a quran to non-muslim which has 'arabic' text as non-muslims don't do 'wudu'",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nOne of my friend is interested in Islam. I had advised him to buy a translation Quran. He bought one 'tamil translation' Quran (we are from Tamil-Nadu, India). That Quran has both arabic text and tamil translation. One of my muslim friend who is very pious said to me that we should not give a quran to non-muslim which has 'arabic' text as non-muslims don't do 'wudu'. But my friend keeps the quran with good respect and touches with clean. He even clean his private parts afetr urin (which is done only by muslims). But he doesn't know about 'wudu'. Now, my question is , 1) Do I have to stop him touching that quran? 2) Should I advise him to buy a quran which doesn't have arabic text? 3) Do I have to do kaffara?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA non-Muslim who is interested in Islam and wishes to study the Qur?aan may be given the Qur?aan with the Arabic text and its translation. (al-Ashbah)\n\nHe should be advised to purify himself before touching the Qur?aan and keep the Qur?aan with respect.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
