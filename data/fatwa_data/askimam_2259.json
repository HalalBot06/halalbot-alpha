  "question": "Can We keep Dogs? For breeding or as pets?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Respected Mufti Saheb, Is it permisible to keep dogs, a) For the purpose of breeding and raising puppies thereafter selling them to make money or as a business. b)For guarding or as a pet\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0AAll creatures are the creation of Allah Ta%E3la and do deserve the recognition%0D%0Aof being a creation of the Almighty. As much as Muslims detest even the%0D%0Asight of pigs - it is the creation of Allah Ta%E3la - and because Allah has%0D%0Aplaced life into it, we cannot inflict pain nor torture the pig.%0D%0A%0D%0ASimilarly Allah Ta%E3la created the dog from among His creation. This does not%0D%0Amean that we should love the dog. It is perhaps the indoctrination of the%0D%0AWestern culture that 'The dog is Man's best Friend'. The theory that 'dogs%0D%0Aare very dependent on Human affection' is a myth - again culture and custom%0D%0Ahas helped to develop this unnatural behaviour.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta%E3la the Creator of this Universe - having created the dog would%0D%0Asurely have known that the dog requires Human affection and love to exist in%0D%0Athis world. Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) would have advised us,%0D%0AMuslims, to keep dogs as pets. On the contrary, we are instructed not to%0D%0Akeep dogs as pets and 'love' them as exemplified by the non-Muslims.%0D%0ARemember our life is structured and bound by the Shariah i.e. The Noble%0D%0AQur%E3n and the beautiful example of Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam). Consider these Ahaadith:%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Talha (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam) said, \"Angels do not enter a house wherein there is a dog%0D%0Aor an animate picture. (Sahih Bukhari Hadith no. 2986)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhuma) reports from Hadhrat Maimoona%0D%0A(Radhiyallaahu %C1nha) that once Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)%0D%0Abecame sad; and said that Jibra'eel (%C1layhis Salaam) promised to meet him at%0D%0Anight but did not turn up. \"By Allah what has kept him back,\" said the%0D%0AProphet (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam). Then he realised a puppy was under%0D%0Ahis bed. He ordered that the puppy be removed and the area be sprinkled with%0D%0Awater. In the afternoon when Jibra'eel (%C1layhi Salaam) came, Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) enquired as to the delay. Jibra'eel (%C1layhi%0D%0ASalaam) said that we, the group of Angels do not enter a house wherein there%0D%0Ais a dog or pictures. (Sahih Muslim Hadith no.3928)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the light of these Ahaadith and other narrations it is not permissible to%0D%0Akeep dogs as pets. The household is deprived of the Mercy of Allah Ta%E3la.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, Jurists have stated that it is permissible to keep a dog, sell dogs%0D%0Aand rear them for security purposes, farming and hunting. (Fataawa%0D%0AMahmoodiyyah vol.8 pg.263)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe saliva of a dog is Najis (impure). If it touches the clothes or body,%0D%0Athat portion also becomes impure and must be washed.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
