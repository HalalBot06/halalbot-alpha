  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am seem to be slipping away from my deen even in Ramadan. I mean that I sometimes seem to doubt the power of Allah S.W.T.A, Astaghfirullah I know it wrong and I don't do it intentionally but even as I?m praying stupid thoughts come into my head & and I am now worried about what may become of me on Judgment day. Please help me & may Allah S.W.T.A reward for your deeds.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhat is the remedy to evil thoughts?%0D%0AA: Evil thoughts are a sign of Imaan. The noble companions complained to%0D%0ANabi (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa sallam) of evil thoughts to which he replied by%0D%0Asaying, 'That is a clear sign of Imaan.' (Mishkaat pg.18; Me'raaj)%0D%0AThe mind is like a highway. Today a king or pious person would pass over it,%0D%0Atomorrow a beggar or evil person will pass by. Similarly one experiences%0D%0Agood thoughts (of performing Salaat, reciting the noble Qur'aan, etc.), as%0D%0Awell as evil thoughts. One should avoid seeing or doing anything that invite%0D%0Asuch thoughts.If the thoughts are not articulated, one will not be%0D%0Aanswerable for them. Evil thoughts are like live electric wires. If one pays%0D%0Aattention to them by touching them, he will get shocked.Similarly, one%0D%0Ashould ignore evil thoughts and engage in something useful. One may also%0D%0Aread 'Laa hawla Walaa Quwaata Illaa billahi al-Aliyy al-Adheem' (There is no%0D%0Apower - to refrain from evil - nor ability - to do good - except with Allah,%0D%0Athe Most High, the Exalted).%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
