  "question": "I understand on judgment day people will walk a wire across the Kidron Valley. Could you explain this? Thank you.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI lived in Saudi Arabia for four years and heard of walking a tightrope or wire across the Kidron or Himnon Valley to the Dome of the Rock. Those who were not worthy would fall into flames below, while the righteous would attain the other side and enter into paradise. I have not been able to find a reference to it in the Qur'an and I can't find any further information. I would like to know if this is correct and where it comes from. Thank you for your time.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe have not come across a Hadith referring to the crossing of the Kidron\nvalley.\n\nHowever, there is a Hadith referring to crossing the bridge over hell\n(Jahannum) which is thinner than a blade. The bridge will have huge grippers\non the side. If a person is unsuccessful in crossing the bridge, he will be\ncaught by the grippers and thrown into hell. This Hadith is narrated in\nBukhari vol.2\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
