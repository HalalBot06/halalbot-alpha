  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it ok to talk on the phone to a woman you planning.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYour question is not complete. If you meant talking to a woman you plan to marry, then that is not permissible. Shari’ah prohibits one from engaging into free talk with a Ghayr Mahram (person with whom marriage is permissible). The rationale behind that is Zina (adultery) is prohibited and any act that has a potential and may lead to Zina is also prohibited. Many people, boys and girls, had such unfortunate experiences. They have communicated in the pretext of marriage and that communication ended up in an immoral way. Many girls also have been misled by some sweet talking person and only to be abused and becoming a victim of empty promises. That can be devastating upon a person especially a girl.\n\nFurthermore, Islam teaches one to be pure in heart, mind and soul. It is natural in a human being to be attracted to the opposite gender. The free and open communication between a male and female will make one’s heart, mind and soul dirty. This is expressed by Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] in the following words, ‘The eyes commit Zina. The hands commit Zina and the feet also commit Zina.’ If one intends getting married to a girl, see her and enquire about her from family and friends. They will be in a better position to inform about her than talking to her. In such a conversation, the boy and girl express themselves in the best and that does not give a true reflection of themselves. In fact, it is misleading. When one is satisfied with the investigation, make Istikhaara and seek the guidance of Allah – the knower of that which is apparent and concealed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
