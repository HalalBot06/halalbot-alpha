  "question": "What is the possibility that God talks directly to us in the form of a voice in your head?Or Wali Allah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThanks you. I'm wondering who is talking to me in my head every day and answering my questions. Thanks.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Fear the insight of a\nbeliever as he sees with the light of Allah.'\n\nIf a person adheres to the laws of Allah Ta'ala, abstain from all forms of\nsins and do righteous deeds, Allah inspires him. That inspiration is called\nIlhaam. There is a difference between Ilhaam of a pious person and\nrevelation of a prophet. Some people were led to a misconception that they\nare recipients of Divine revelations and subsequently claimed to be a\nprophet. That is an act of the Shaytaan. You should guard yourself against\nthat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
