  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. If I travel more than 88KM in one direction and then return to my home town for a short while, maybe a few hours, and then travel less than 88 km in another direction, will I be a musaafir at the second place? I will stay less than 15 days. 2. I travel to a place 70Km from my home. While there I make intention to travel a further 30Km, i.e. 100Km away from my home. Will I be a musaafir? Do I become a musaafir as soon as I make the intention, or when I commence the journey to the next town?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If you returned to your home town, your 'Safar' will terminate. Hence,\nyou will not be a Musaafir if you travel from your home town for lesser than\n88 km.\n2. To qualify as a Musaafir, the intention must be made from your home to\ntravel a distance of 88 km or more. The laws of 'Safar will be binding on\nyou once you pass the last house from the residential area of your town or\nthat part of your area that is included as part of your town, e.g. shopping\narea, etc. If you are within these areas the laws of Safar will not be\nbinding.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
