  "question": "Can I change the niyaah to make it more meaningful?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu alaikum I made a niyaah that if my husband finds a job then I will help conducting two weddings of poor family girls and send someone to hajj. Alhamdulilah! My husband found a job. After that I had helped 2 weddings and another one I had sent jewels. Just waiting for marriage to be finalized so that I can send some more money during the wedding. Regarding hajj, one of my friend said that hajj is not fard. So she asked me to help a student to study or help a family during wedding etc. So, then I did not look for someone to send to hajj and instead I was helping a student and also helping another muslim family on the wedding. My husband was having so much difficulties in his job so that there is also a chance of loosing it. I was very confused. I was thinking that its happening because of me by not fullfilling the niyaah I made. For the poor family which I am currently helping now, the bridegroom is not finalized. so there is a delay in the wedding. But I have my intention that I will be helping them of whatever they need. People also said that helping a family to finish the wedding has good rewards like sending someone to hajj. Pls let me know if I should continue what I am doing or if I should stick to the niyyah initially I made. Pls let me know as soon as possible as if you answer to stick with the initial niyyah then I need to make necessary arrangements for hajj as its already Ramadan now. Salaams\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSince you have already initiated to assist in this marriage, continue with it. You may assist someone with their Hajj in the future. It does not have to be this year. As long as the delay is for a valid reason, one is excused.\n\nOne should not be suspicious about the problems with your husband?s job. These things occur and are part and parcel of life on earth.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
