  "question": "How often can married woman visit her parents?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis is a matter of mutual agreement. Both the husband and wife need to be accommodating towards each other. The husband should not refuse permission to his wife unnecessarily nor should the wife be unfair in her wanting to go more than required.\n\nThis will also differ from situation to situation. The parents of the girl may be old age and have nobody else to tend to them, then in this case the wife should be allowed to visit her parents more regularly.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
