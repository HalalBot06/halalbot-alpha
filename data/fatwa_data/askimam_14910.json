  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nJust wanted to find out about the halaal bodies we currently have in this country. As far as I know SANHA is in order,because their are affiliated with the jamiat etc. But what about NIHT,MJC?? Are we allowed to consume products certified by them??\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIn principal, the information of one reliable Muslim (Aadil) is sufficient regarding halal and haram. It is up to the individual enquiring about halal and haram to be satisfied with the information. If one is satisfied with the information of halal and haram from anyone of the halal certifying bodies, then one may follow that. If there is any doubts then one should abstain.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
