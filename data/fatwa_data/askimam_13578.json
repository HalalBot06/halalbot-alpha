  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nLately i have been watching these christian network stations, the other day i watched a program in which a evagelist claimed to bring a man back to life by praying to jesus..again all over the network they are these programs in which people are healed by praying to jesus ect. Im sure you are aware of these programs. My question is, how should i respond to these events? is there an explanation behind these \"Healing\" sessions? are they fakes? I am a new muslim and sometimes these events baffle me.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is our belief that Allah Alone is Khaaliq (Creator) and Mumeet (Giver of Death). He Alone is Muhyiy (Giver of life after death).\n\nAllah is Shaafi’ee (Curer). However, we also believe in the concept of Karaamat (miracles) of the pious. Allah grants such power to His chosen slaves. That includes healing the sick. The miracle of Hadhrat Eesa (Jesus - Alayhis salaam) of curing the ill is mentioned in the Qur’aan. That was when he was in the world. Such miracles are also practiced by many pious Muslims only by the Power of Allah.\n\nWe do not, however, invite people to Islam on the basis of such miracles. What if a person accepts a religion based on miracles but do not experience miracles after accepting that religion. He may not be satisfied with the religion and renegade. One should accept Islam based on its sound and correct beliefs. As he practices Islam, Allah will favour him/her with many bounties.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
