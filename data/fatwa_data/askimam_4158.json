  "question": "Salam. Muslims, Kaffir's disgusting guts...",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam, What should I do if a Muslim man does want to say Kalima because he might feel shamed of our Muslim ways? And what should I do if a \"non muslim\" says bad stuff about Islam...? Should I fight them or defend Islam in words? What can I do nowdays because Americans are treating us Muslims the bad ways like they fight us and hit women...? Thank you. Wasalam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1)We do not understand the details of your first question. Kindly Rephrase.\n2) Allah Taala describes some qualities of his pious servants. Among them,\none is when the ignorant speak to them they say salaam (avoid them with\nwisdom and diplomacy). We advise you apply wisdom and do not re-act to any\nstatement made by non-muslims. We should rather display good character and\nhumility.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
