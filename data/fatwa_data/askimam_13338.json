  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIn aalim cd they mistranslate a hadith. Their translation says Allah created Adam in His own form though I asked my sheikh and he told me they translated it incorrectly. He also said that is shirk. So a Muslim who reads that and accepts that goes to hell forever?? I've read that so long as you don't commit shirk you'll eventually leave hell. So can a jew go to heaven after being adequately punished or kufr in prophets is also hell forever?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. This Hadith comes in Mishkaat (Kitabul Aadaab). Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) says, ‘Allah created Aadam in ‘His’ form.’ The contentious word in this translation is the personal pronoun ‘His’ (sooratihi), which in this text is prefixed with the word ‘form’. The question is to whom is the pronoun relating to. If it is relating to Aadam (Alayhis salaam), which is the correct way to understand it, then the explanation following in the following words, i.e. his height 60 handspans, etc. However, if the pronoun ‘His’ is relating to Allah, then one could say that this is beyond our understanding, but could mean that Allah has placed his qualities of mercy, etc. in Aadam (Alayhis salaam). Thus, a Muslim who reads thus and accept thus, Insha Allah, would not go to hell forever.\n\n2. Allah Ta’ala states, ‘Verily, the religion in Allah’s eyes is Islam’ and further, ‘Whomsoever follows a religion other than Islam, it would not be accepted from him.’ (Aali Imraan Aayat19). In the light of the above Aayat, we find that only Islam is accepted by Allah. This ruling was only established when it was revealed to Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). However, all religions of the previous prophets (Alayhimus salaam) was also Islam as all propagated the same. However, with this ruling, all previous religions were abrogated and only Islam is accepted. This is further emphasised by Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) when he said that if Moosa (Alayhis salaam) were to find me, he would have to follow my religion. Further on, we believe that Eesa (Alayhis salaam) will be returned to this world and he will follow Imaam Mahdi in Salaat and not lead the Salaat. This is also proof that Eesa will follow the religion of Islam and will not bring his own religion, neither would he follow Christianity. Those who come across Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and his teachings of Islam, are bound to accept Islam to enter paradise or they may burn in hell forever.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
