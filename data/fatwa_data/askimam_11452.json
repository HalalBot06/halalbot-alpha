  "question": "Is it allowed to take break from office for jumma?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu alaikum mufti saheb, I work for an Indian software company.Our company sent me to UK on a project.I worked there for two years and came back to India one year back. There in UK, the mosque was too far from the office.I used to take nearly 2.5 hrs break for jumma.My project leader(he is also from our indian company) to whom I report is aware of this. We have to work 7.5 hours a day. On fridays I only spend 6hrs or 5.5 hrs at work as I spend remaining time for jumma. I don't think my work was incomplete because of my giong to Jumma. We used to spend time in browsing internet also as we did not have that much work load.If at all I neglected some work, it was definitely not because of going to jumma.I would have completed that work, had I felt that work was that much important. We were given computers to our homes also. I would have compensated my friday break at home if there was work load.But always the time was not a problem as I told you that we used to spend time in browsing net. Now my question is Had I committed a mistake by not spending extra time to compensate my friday break? What should I do now? I am going to stay in the project for 1.5 months more(but in India as our project is shifted to India). DO I have to work for extra hours these 1.5 months and do some useful work(which is not expected from me) to the company ? I request you to consider this little urgent. Sorry for the inconvinience.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the management of the company had granted you permission to go for Jumu?ah on Fridays, then you do not have to compensate for that time.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
