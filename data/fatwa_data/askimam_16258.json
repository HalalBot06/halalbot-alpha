I have a follow up to my last query.\n\nI want your guidance on the following case: I intend to lease a car. The leasing company doesn't own a particular car (I have seen the car at a showroom). I ask the leasing company to own that particular car and then lease it to me. Is my dealing legitemate in Islamic sharia' ?\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is permissible for the learning company to own the car and then lease it to you.
