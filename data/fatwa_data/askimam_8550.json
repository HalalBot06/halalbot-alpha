  "question": "Whether Mufti Rashid Ahmad(of ahsan ul Fatawa) is a correct aalim or not",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI want to ask If Mufti Rashid ahmad was a correct aalim or not. 1. Some say he differed from ulama-e Haqq 2. Others say He chose TAQWA in matters of controversies. 3.Tell me if it is correct to pledge bayah to any of his khalifah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHazrat Mufti Rashid Ahmad Saheb (R.A.A) was from amongst the illustrious Ulama-ul-Haqq therefore it will be incorrect to label him as an incorrect Aalim because he differed with the general Ulama. Also, Mufti Rashid Ahmad Saheb was a spiritual reformer (sheikh) who guided people through his lectures. Although his method was very strict, many people benefited spiritually from his lectures and advices. One should note that a person should only take bay? at on the hands of such a sheikh with whom he has an understanding and affinity. Also, one should always abstain from degrading any person during and after his period of reformation. A Muslim should always keep in mind the well being of the Ummah and abstain from fighting and quarrelling over petty differences. %0D%0A%0D%0AIf there is a difference of opinion between the general Ulama and the Ulama-ul-Haqq, it is totally incorrect and insensible to regard one party to be on total Haqq and the other to be on open deviation.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Ashraf%0D%0ADarul Ifta ?
