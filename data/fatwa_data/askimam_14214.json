  "answer": "QUESTION\nAre \"People of the book\" (Christians and Jews) labeled as Kufar as well as people who do not believe in the Oneness of Allah? What is the defintion of Kufar? Can we just call anyone a Kufa? Jazaakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe word ‘Kuffaar’ is derived from the word ‘Kufr’ which means to deny. If a person denies the existence of Allah and/or that Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] being the final messenger and/or the Qur’aan being the final book of Allah, then such an individual is a Kaafir. (Mustalih alfaadh al-fiqhiyyah pg.150)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
