  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamualaikum can u please differentiate between: 1.Masjid Al-Aqsa 2.The Dome of the Rock 3.gombad i khizara 4.Baytul Maqdas and 5. the Temple Mount JazakAllah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMasjid-al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock (not sure of it’s Arabic name) are\ntwo diffferent masjids within close proximity of each other. Masjid-al-Aqsa\nhas a green dome and is located behind the Dome of the Rock, which has a\ngolden dome and is the bigger of the two masjids. The golden dome was built\ndirectly above the rock – visible today inside the masjid – that marks the\nsite of the Prophet’s (SAW) ascent to heaven. The rock is also reputed to be\nwhere Ibrahim (AS) prepared to sacrifice Ismail (AS).\nBoth masjids are situated in a walled compound called the Haram al-Sharif\n(the Noble Sanctuary). The Haram al-Sharif is what the Jews allege to be the\nTemple Mount, where the Temple of Solomon [Sulaiman (AS)] once stood. On the\nwest side of the compound, are the supposed remains of part of the wall that\nformed the Temple of Solomon, revered by the Jews today as the Wailing Wall.\nThis wall is where the Prophet (SAW) tied Buraq on the night of Lailatul\nMiraj.\nThere are many websites with a wealth of information on the Dome of the rock\nand Masjid-al-Aqsa, as well as photographs and maps of the old city of\nAl-Quds. It is important not to confuse the Dome of the Rock with the Mosque\nof Umar ibn al-Khattab (RA), as some websites have incorrectly assumed. This\nmasjid is not situated in the Haram al-sharif (which houses only two\nmasjids), but is close by, and is opposite the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\n\nand Allah Ta’ala Knows Best"
