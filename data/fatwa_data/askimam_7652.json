  "answer": "QUESTION\nOne ustad was telling me that the money from interest cannot be eaten at all,either by us or another person. Could you please explain differences of opinion between syafii,and hanafi\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is necessary to give interest monies to someone who is eligible for Zakaat without any intention of reward. If you are not eligible for Zakaat, you may not use the interest.\n\nHowever, the person that may receive Zakaat may accept the amount and consume from it.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
