  "question": "What is the sharee hukm about the followings",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1.can we pass something to the weeping child during namaz if he is far but the toy is near 2.can we move the child away from danger in namaz if like he is going to put his finger in the fan\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Such an act will constitute Amal-e-Kathir which is from amongst those\nfactors that invalidate the Salaat. Amaal-e-Katheer means to do such an act\nwhich gives the impression to onlookers that he is doing something else,\nrather than performing Salaat. (Al-Fiqhul Muyassar pg.90)\n2. It is necessary for one to break his Salaat to avert any serious harm\ncoming to him or someone else. The cited example will definitely fall within\nthis ambit.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
