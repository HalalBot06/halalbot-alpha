  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam Alaikum. I would like to know the interpreataion of a dream I had sometime ago. In my dream, i saw myself inside a masjid. And then i see the doors of the masjid open from inside and a parade of people walk in. Amongst them I saw their leader, he was a bearded man with a smile on his face. The people in the masjid (amongst whom i was as well), greeted the leader and his people with lots of respect and gratitude. What could this dream mean, and who could be that bearded leader and his people?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream is a mubarak (blessed dream). It is a reflection of your love for\nsalaah and the musjid. It also indicates that a true leader guides his\npeople to salaah and the musjid. We are unable to comment who the leader was\nin your dream.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
