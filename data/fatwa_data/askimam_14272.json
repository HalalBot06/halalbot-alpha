  "question": "Is it valid for a person who is not the regular Muazzin but has given",
  "answer": "QUESTION\ni) Our MSA here at University had been trying to get a room for Friday\nprayers for the summer but they were unable to do so for the correct time\ni.e. when Zuhr time begins. Instead, what they did was consult a 'Salafi'\ninfluenced Sheikh. The Sheikh said that Jumaah and Zuhr are two different\nmatters and, based on the bookings and scheduling problems, you can pray\nJummah before the actual Zuhr time starts. Based on this, the MSA booked\nplaces for the entire summer for times before the actual Zuhr time begins\n(as early as 1.5 hours BEFORE Zuhr and as late as half an hour BEFORE Zuhr).\nNow, I know very well that Jummah prayers are completely invalid if they are\noffered before the Zuhr time starts. That's why I was very disappointed to\nhear this, however, I am sure the MSA will not change anything now as the\nbookings have been done and they have already announced this to everybody.\nMy question now is: what should I do in this situation as I am working\nfull-time at University in the summer? The closest Musallah to the\nUniversity is about a 15 min drive but they also start Friday prayers 15\nminutes before the Zuhr time. Besides, it will be quite inconvenient and\ntime consuming to leave campus and pray somewhere else. Please advise me\nwhat should I do in this situation.\nii) Is it valid for a person who is not the regular Muazzin but has given\nthe Azan for a particular prayer, to become Imam of that prayer then?\nSometimes when I enter our Musallah, there's no one there so I give the Azan\nmyself. If the time of Jama'at comes and I find no one is willing to lead\nthe prayer, can I lead that prayer myself?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAfter considering a host of authentic proofs from unanimously accepted books of Hadith including Sahih Bukhari, the official ruling of the Hanafi Madhab is that the time of Jumu’ah only begins after midday. (Raddul Muhtaar vol.2 pg.147; HM Saeed). Imaam Bukhari [ra] annotated his Sahih on this opinion.\n\nAccording to the Hanbali Madhab, the most preferred time for Jumu’ah is also after midday. However, based on an inference from a Hadith in Sahih Bukhari, Jumu’ah Salaat before midday is also valid according to the Hanbali Madhab. (al-Mughni vol.2 pg.142; Ilmiyah)\n\nFurthermore, Jumu’ah is one of the salient features of our Deen and it will be regrettable if you were deprived thereof. However, a large congregation and a Musjid are not preconditions for Jumu’ah. According to the Hanafi Madhab, four individuals including the Imaam are sufficient. (Shaami vol.1 pg.150; HM Saeed). Therefore, we advise that you rally to secure a congregation of another three individuals, obtain a basic Arabic Khutbah from an Aalim (which you can easily read out) and Jumu’ah may be offered in your office or in a classroom.\n\nIf you are unsuccessful in your endervours, then we advise that you perform Dhuhr Salaat after midday and continue praying to Allah to create an alternative for you for the Jumu’ah prayers. It is permissible for a person who has given Adhaan to be appointed as Imaam for the same Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
