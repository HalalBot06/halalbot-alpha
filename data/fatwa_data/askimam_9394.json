  "question": "I read in the book Bahishti Zewar that trees with trunk are properties of others but plants without trunk, grass can be used by general public even if on private property",
  "answer": "QUESTION\njust like well on private property. So does that mean that we can break it of in parks just because we are playing around?2. Also would it be trespassing on private property if we walk on someone?s front yard which is not fenced? Because here they have the house in front of which is the walkway for everyone to use (general public) and then in front of that is the front yard. 3. I also read that hair should be covered for women when going to bathroom. Does that mean entire hair should be covered like in salat or some hair can show? 4. If I am reading my salat and someone throws something across me. Ex. I am facing qiblah. A person on my right throws some clothes or something to the left from in front of me. Is that gunnah for that person? Should I stop that person? 5 if one bring ones hand in front of a person reading salat, is that sinful? 6. If I (a female) wake up late for fajr and there is just enough time for 2 fard. Should I just omit the 2 sunnats? Do I have to do qaza in this case for 2 sunnats? 7. same as above, that I wake up late and do 2 fard of fajr. But after that I still have time for 2 sunnats, should I offer them or do qaza later? 8. If I am reading 4 farz of zohr and I realize that my 4 sunnats were invalid for some reason. Should I offer 2 sunnat, 2 nafl of zohr and then repeat 4 sunnats or should I offer 4 sunnat right after 4 farz and then continue with 2 sunnat and 2 nafl? Would this same rule apply for any other salat?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It will be permissible to uproot grass and wild plants in parks. (Raddul Muhtaar, Vol. 5, Page 312)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. It will be regarded as trespassing if done unnecessarily. (Fataawaa Aalamgeeriyyah, Vol. 5, Page 373)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Both males and females are commanded to enter the toilet with their heads covered. However, it will not be necessary for females to cover all their hair as in Salaah. (Raddul Muhtaar, Vol. 1, Page 559)%0D%0A%0D%0A4. In this case the person throwing the object will not be sinful, although to do so is discouraged. The Musalli should not prevent the person from throwing the object whilst he is performing his Salaah.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. He will not be sinful although it is discouraged.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. If there is only sufficient time for the person to perform the two Rak?aats Fardh, then he should only perform the Fardh. However it is preferable to make Qadhaa of the Sunnah after sunrise upto Zawaal. (Raddul Muhtaar, Vol. 1, Page 530)%0D%0A%0D%0A7. It is not permissible to perform the two Sunnah after the Fardh before sunrise. However it is preferable to make Qadhaa of the Sunnah after sunrise upto Zawaal. (Raddul Muhtaar, Vol. 1, Page 530)%0D%0A%0D%0A8. One should perform two Rak?aats Sunnah after the four Fardh of Zuhr, followed by the four Rak?aats Sunnah that was supposed to be performed before the Fardh and thereafter the two Rak?aat Nafl should be performed. The same ruling will apply to the other Salaats. (Ahsanul Fataawaa, Vol. 3, Page 484-485)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Ashraf%0D%0ADARUL IFTA ?
