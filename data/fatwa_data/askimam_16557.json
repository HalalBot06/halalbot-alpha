  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nRecently i went through a correspondence course prospectus in which the fee structure was mentioned like Total course fee Rs. 1,200/- in 12 instalments of Rs. 100 per month.Â  If we pay in lumpsum on joining the course fee is only Rs. 1,000. Could you plz tell me whether if i select to pay with the instalment scheme, is the excess Rs. 200 equal to interest according to Shariah.?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThe free structure is according to Shariah.\n\nIn effect if one pays a lumpsom amount, he will get a discount of Rs.200. The Rs.200 in the monthly installments of Rs.200 will not be interest.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
