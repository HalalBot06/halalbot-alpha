  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf one is studying fiqh and/or any other courses in a distant region from home, and Jihaad overwhelms the land, will it be mandatory for the pursuer of knowledge to stay and fight? Or will he have to return home and ask for permission from his parents?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJihad under normal circumstances is Fardul Kifayah, thus a person will have to ask the permission of his parents before fighting. If the Jihad is classified as Fardul Ain (Fard upon every person), then their permission will not be necessary. (Raddul Muhtaar Vol.4 Pg.124-127. H.M.Saeed, Bahrul Raiq Vol.5 Pg.77)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
