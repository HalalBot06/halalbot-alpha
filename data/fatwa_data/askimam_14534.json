  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nRegarding Fatwa 13974. I am following the last ruling. When I received the fatwa I back tracked my haydh dates till I could remember that is till January and then I counted as said in the fatwa. Recently a thought came into my mind that maybe I need to count back further like I remember in Ramadan that after my haydh I didn’t have a clean period of 15 days after this I don’t know what happened although I do remember having haydh (red, brown and black) once. I don’t know about yellow discharge and I don’t know if I had clean period of 15 days or not. Do I have to count back from Ramadan or further?\n\nAlso when I became baaligh I was taught that red, black and brown is haydh. Only recently that is last year I found out that its red, black, brown, yellow and green. Do I have to make up my salaah since I became baaligh? Because I do remember having yellow discharge but what times I don’t remember\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYou should estimate as far back as you are able to remember. Then make up the qadha salah (make up some extra salah incase you don't remember). Also, repent and do Istigfar.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
