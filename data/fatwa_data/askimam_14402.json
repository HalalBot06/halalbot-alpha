  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAfter the Fajr Salaat, people in our Masjid get involved with the hand-shaking ritual, and inquiring about each other’s well being, being a major source of distraction to people trying to make Du’aa.\n\nThese are people who come for Fajr Salaat the most pious of the community, it’s definitely good to enquire about each other’s ‘khair-khairiyat’, but don’t know why they have to be so loud, and why they can’t do so outside the Masjid. Sometimes I give up making Du’aa as I simply can’t concentrate because of the noices. There are others sitting in Dhikr, who I’m sure get affected as well. Are these people really walking out with a reward?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThis is an administrative issue that has to be dealt by with the trustees of the Musjid. You could approach the responsible members of the committee and seek their intervention in the matter. This would be a more effective and amicable way of resolving your concern. It is vital to know that the unity of the community is extremely important. This unity and brotherhood cannot be sacrificed. If this issue is handled in a professional manner through the correct procedures and channels, your concerns will be addressed and the unity will be maintained.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
