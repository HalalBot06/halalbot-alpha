  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for your question. May Allah Ta'ala in HIS infinite mercy ease your difficulties in your marriage and put love and affection in your hearts for each other. Ameen.\n\nSister, you say your husband considers you to be an ignorant person who is also false, impious and troublesome. I find it difficult to understand why he should have this impression of you. Do you think it will be possible to send more details so that we can try to understand what the problem is, and insha'allah work with you to heal the rift between yourself and your husband?\n\nMay Allah Ta'ala guide and protect your family. Ameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n1SOCIAL DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
