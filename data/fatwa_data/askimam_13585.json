  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am wondering if you would be so kind as to advise my family on what to do about my older sister. She is 27 and was born deaf. She has been experiencing very troubling dreams lately where she is being attacked, however, she first experienced the dream over 3yrs ago when she got engaged, since then the engagement broke off and she remains unmarried. Although the dreams are different from one another,the one constant factor of the dream is she experiences an evil presence coming for her and she feels it reaching into her soul and trying to take her somewhere she doesnt want to go. Her subconscious knows she is sleeping and she prays in her sleep. She resists the presence and wakes with pain in her chest and back where she felt the presence trying to pull her. Sometimes she dreams of animals like a black dog or men attacking her but so far she has always fought back in her dreams. She gets very upset,especially recently as she has these dreams a few times a night. What is unusual is that the last dream she had, she heard evil laughter and words spoken in a different language and yet she is deaf.. Please advise us, although Allah SWT knows best.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nPlease note, this is a forum for Fiqh.\n\nWe will not take any queries pertaining to social matters or dreams through this forum.
