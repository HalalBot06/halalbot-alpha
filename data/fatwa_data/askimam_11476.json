Should I marry ?Should I stay single and keep fasting? If i marry how will I satisfy her sexually ?I am in pain.Please help me .Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for writing to the institute regarding your problem.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt has become fashionable for so called scientists, biologists, social%0D%0Aengineers & others to claim that homosexuality is \"genetic, hormonal,%0D%0Acongenital, a mental illness, and biologically predetermined\".%0D%0AAlhamdulillah, you have repented and you are striving to live your life in%0D%0Aaccordance with Allah Ta'ala's commands. Please understand that my response%0D%0Ato your mail is not in judgment of you.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala did not create homosexuals and lesbians. Allah Ta'ala created%0D%0Aman and woman to be comforters, partners, lovers and companions of each%0D%0Aother. It is through the sexual union of a man and woman that a child is%0D%0Agranted to the couple. If Allah Ta'ala had intended for men to have sex with%0D%0Amen and women with women, He would have clearly stated so in the Quran.%0D%0AHowever, we read of Allah Ta'ala's wrath and the destruction of people who%0D%0Awent against His plan for mankind. It is through the Quran, which is Allah%0D%0ATa'ala's speech to us, that we are clearly reminded that same sex partners%0D%0Aare not acceptable to Allah Ta'ala.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou have not experienced the pleasure of a woman's love, comfort and grace.%0D%0AYou have not sensed the warmth of her body. You have not known the pleasure%0D%0Awhich Allah Ta'ala has placed in fulfilling your sexual desires with a%0D%0Awoman.So how can you say that you are not attracted to the idea of a wife?%0D%0AUnfortunately, you are bombarded with arguments that are 'pro gay this and%0D%0Apro gay that' which have probably helped you to accept that this is the life%0D%0Afor you. Those who wish to propagate and make fashionable this lifestyle%0D%0Ahave managed to con governments, so called pious people and even the%0D%0Achurches etc into believing that being gay is a perfect way of life. Do not%0D%0Aallow yourself to be conned by this hyped up garbage. The subtle and devious%0D%0Ajuxtopositioning of terms like \"sexual orientation \" and \"sex role identity\"%0D%0Aare meant to give a message to you that your condition was pre-ordained and%0D%0Afixed by some force beyond your control.As if Allah Ta'ala had no part in%0D%0Ayour Creation and your role in this world, na'uthu-billah.You are Allah%0D%0ATa'ala's creation. You are just as special, if not more special than the%0D%0Anext human being. You have been granted the greatest gift of all, that of%0D%0Aimaan. Give yourself the opportunity to live your life according to Allah%0D%0ATa'ala's plans and cast off the hype of those who do their utmost to make%0D%0Ayou believe otherwise.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou say that you have felt this way since childhood. I aim to ask you some%0D%0Avery personal questions.Did you indulge in or were you made to indulge in%0D%0Asexual activity with boys or men at an early age? Did an adult male or older%0D%0Aboy molest you or expose himself to you when you were a child? Were you made%0D%0Ato view pornography involving males?%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is possible that somewhere in your childhood something triggered this%0D%0Abelief in you. Please feel free to discuss your problem with me.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllow me to suggest that you sincerely seek Allah Ta'ala's guidance and%0D%0Aassistance in this matter. Read the holy Quran with meaning and with%0D%0Acommentary so that you can fully appreciate Allah Ta'ala's laws and plans.%0D%0APerform your 5 salaahdaily punctually everyday. Perform salaatul Haajjah and%0D%0Asalaatul Tahajjud everyday. Make istigfar and recite darood in abundance.%0D%0ATry to focus on changing your mindset and overcoming the negative influences%0D%0Aaround you. Speak to an elder in your family or community and ask them to%0D%0Aapproach your parents with a view to giving you more time beofre making any%0D%0Adecisions rearding marraige. If possible, seek counselling from a pious%0D%0Aperson or a Muslim psychologist who has taqwa and is deeni conscious. You%0D%0Aare welcome to write to me again if you wish to do so. May Allah Ta'ala%0D%0Aembrace you with His love and grant you the best of this world and the%0D%0Ahereafter. Ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A1SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
