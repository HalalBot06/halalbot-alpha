  "question": "I am a medical practitioner and was contracted to a medical scheme for 5years. Last year, I terminated the contract. Subsequently, the medical scheme became insolvent.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome of my patients who were also contracted to the scheme refuse to pay me for services rendered to them, they state that the scheme is responsible to pay me. Is that correct?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari?ah, the contractual agreement with you and your\npatients and the medical scheme is termed as Hawalah (transferral of debts).\nTherefore, in principle, the medical scheme is responsible in paying any\noutstanding debt incurred during the contractual period among the three\nparties. However, only those patients will be indebted to you directly at\nthe time when the contract terminated with the scheme. Consequently, since\nthe medical scheme is under liquidation, you may claim for outstanding\namounts directly from the patients. The patients are duty bound to pay for\nthe services rendered to them. (Shaami vol.5 pg.348; Tijaariyyah)\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
