  "question": "Is minor nose Cartilage surgery permissible?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have a problem in the sense that my nose is very round, big and slightly bent to the left. Due to this appearance I lack confidence in the sense I feel everyone is looking at me and thinking 'what an ugly sight it is, i too feel that it is very repulsive and is a distraction to others and myself when i am dealing in my day to day business. In this circumstance, i would like to know if it is possible for me to see a plastic surgeon to carry out minor corrective surgery ie . I would like to know if shariah will allow me to do this. Because it will help me a lot to face people.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible to undergo a nose cartilage surgery if you do not have%0D%0Aa breathing difficulty. The nose being round, big and being to the left is%0D%0Ano Shar'ee grounds for the surgery. There is no need for you to lack%0D%0Aconfidence due to that.%0D%0A%0D%0AYour appearance is natural like the appearance of any person. It is a well%0D%0Aknown fact that every person is different with a different form and shape.%0D%0AYour lack of confidence is probably due to your assumption that people are%0D%0Aconcentrating on your nose. That is not the case. Be thankful to Allah that%0D%0Ayou have a nose and can easily breath. There are people who don't have%0D%0Anoses, just nostrils. There are people who have normal noses but have%0D%0Adifficulty in breathing, they have to breath through their mouths causing%0D%0Alack of sleep, etc. They cherish having a normal breathing cycle. Don't%0D%0Aassume people are looking and concentrating on you, thus, causing you a%0D%0Apsychological imbalance. Build your confidence and don't bother about people%0D%0A's baseless opinions about you.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
