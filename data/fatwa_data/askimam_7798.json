  "answer": "QUESTION\nAfter Istikhara I hope that you might be able to interpret a dream for me please. My sister is considering a proposal for marriage from a young man. She was not totally happy in marrying this man. She has done Istikhara prayer three times. One time after istikhara, in a dream she saw herself at a gathering (party of some sort) where she noticed another man who was dressed very smartly. She did not see his face but saw what he was wearing. In the dream this was a different man to the one who proposed in real life, but she felt that this man had the qualities that she was looking for in a husband, unlike the man who has proposed. Should she or should she not marry him? My mother also did istikhara and saw a party taking place, possibly a wedding.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf your sister has any reservations in her heart even after making Istikhaara, she should continue with it until she is content and sure of her decision.\n\nIf she is sure, we advise she also make Mashwara (consult) with her seniors and decide thereafter. Obviously, the seniors being responsible people will take the right steps in advising her.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
