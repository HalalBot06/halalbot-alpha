  "answer": "QUESTION\nis there anything such as love between two people before marriage. like how 2 ppl promise each that they love only each other and no one else. and how they promise to marry no one but each other. i heard that its in the quran, that no relationship lasts unless its for the sake of Allah? please correct me if iam wrong and provide me on how can 2 ppl love each other(before marriage) for the sake of Allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nLove is based upon the inclinations of the opposite sexes only. It can come\nabout between two males as well. love for the sake of Allah means that a\nperson is not prompted by material gains or by some favour, etc. of the\nother person but solely for the pleasure of Allah, he loved another human\nbeing.\n\nAccording to the Hadith, there is nothing as strong as marriage to engender\nlove between two people.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
