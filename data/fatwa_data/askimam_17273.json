  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nIn Fatwa Number 16531 the questioner asks,\n\n \n\n “I have read in Q&A page that if napaki is in /-5.94cm quantity then u don’t have to wash it u can offer salah and the salah will be correct with Tahaarah. So i want to ask if i passed a drop of  urine or mazi without thinking any sexual thing(not that thing which is occur during sexual  intercourse) less quantity then /-5.94cm so if I don’t wash my undergarment or private part, can  I offer salah in this position?”\n\nIn reply you say,\n\n“If any impurity is less than 5.94cm then salah will be valid without washing it. However the salah will be makrooh. Therefore it is preferable that one washes that amount of impurity as well.”\n\nMy situation is such that drops of urine or mazi come out all the time maybe every 5 to 10 minutes or sometimes at random times one after another. And I cant change my Boxershorts and clothes every time this happens and clean the place that might be affected because I go to school as well. Reading your answer soothed my heart allot but I’m still not sure what your answer means fully. Is it ok for me to pray all day in those pants regardless of knowing of the drops(less in quantity than /-5.94cm) which are present and the next day just change my pants without cleaning the surrounding area on my legs or will I still need to clean that to. Am I a mazoor?. And if the urine drop makes my pants wet and the pants touch my jeans do they have to be washed to or is it ok for me to leave them.\n\nAnd finally when you say that the impurity should be less in quantity than /-5.94cm does that mean one drop at any one time or all the drops size in the day add up together.\n\nJazakallah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAs a principle, if any impurity (najasat ghaliza) is 5.94cm then it is wajib (necessary) to remove the impurity. If any impurity is less than this amount then it will be mustahab (preferable) to remove the impurity.\n\nBased on this principle, if the urine drops is equal to the 5.94cm then you will have to wash your garments before performing salah and if it is less than this amount then it will be preferable to wash your garment before prayer.\n\nIf your undergarment also makes your outer garment wet, then this will be considered as two separate impurities.\n\nIn calculating 5.94cm one will gather all the different portions of impurity and add them together. Each impurity will not be counted separately.\n\nWe advise that you try placing something, for example, toilet paper in your under garment which you could change before every salah. This will be more practical.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Ishaq E. Moosa,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
