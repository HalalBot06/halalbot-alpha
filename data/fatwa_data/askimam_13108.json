  "question": "1) What would happen if a woman were to start her menses during hajj?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) What would happen if a woman were to start her menses during hajj? 2) Is there anytime during the Hajj that a woman can be on her menses? 3) Why is it that men and women are allowed to pray together during hajj without segregated areas whereas they have to be separate when praying everywhere else?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a woman happens to get her menses during the days of hajj she must continue to do all the acts of the hajj except for the Tawaaf (circumbulation) of the Kabaa and the Sa'ee(running between mount Safaa and Murwaa. She can only do this act once she is clean of her menses had her ghusal then she can do the tawaaf and the sa'ee.\n\nAs for the second part of the question which was put to the authorities in the Kingdom and the answer was that because of the crowds that are too large they leave the haram open and trust the people to ensure that there is separation between the males and females. However this becomes very difficult with people that are not very well educated and families want to stand together. Our view is that the authorities must return to their previous rulings of the segregation of sexes.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nShaykh Irshaad Amod\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Imraan Vawda"
