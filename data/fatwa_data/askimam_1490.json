  "question": "Is my neeat the basis apon which I reach all my objectives? How can I improve the quality of my Neeat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy immediate aims are to be accepted in Oxford University and Inshallah in the next few years be good enough to play cricket for my country, Pakistan. To the best of my knowledge, my Neeat is true, yet i seek a Prayer that will allow me to express these ambitions clearly as i know nothing is possible without Allah's will. I also seek to realise justifiable my aims are Islamically.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAny past time games whether on video, computer, etc. falls in the category of Lahw and Laáb (useless and pasttime) hence, not permissible. Allah Taãla ? the Creator of our Universe ? declares in the Noble Qurãn, ?I have not created Man and Jinn except for (the purpose) of worship.?(Qurãn 51:57) When our Maker and Rabb whom we, the creation are accountable to, invariably states our purpose in this world then our objective will be just that despite any human being thinking otherwise. No creation can change this directive. Having said that, the Noble Qurãn on no less than five places warns about this worldly life - that this life is but a sport and a past-time. The two words used are ?lahw? and ?laáb? which the Jurists have defined as games, sports, and past-times. Basically ?lahw? and ?laáb? do not bring any benefit and together takes one away from the remembrance of Allah Taãla and the Hereafter. Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, ?Every game of man is Haraam except three: a man plays with his wife, breaking (training) one?s horse and archery.? In another Hadith, Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaahu Ánhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, ?Teach your children swimming and archery.? Jurists have commented that a sport/game : a) which has no religious Or worldly benefit is not permissible; b) which has worldly or religious benefit is subjected to the following conditions: i) that none of it should be contrary to the Shariáh ii) that it (the sport/game) should not resemble the sport/games specifically identified with other religious communities e.g. Yoga; which may have some worldly and/or religious benefit but includes an impermissible act e.g. wrestling (exposing the awrah). Due to the many evils in contemporary sports, it is not permissible for you to intend participating in playing cricket for your country. To make a sincere intention for a wrong thing is baseless. and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai FATWA DEPT."
