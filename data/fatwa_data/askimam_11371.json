  "question": "Is it Haram to eat from Non-Muslims if they know what is and isn’t Halal and they don’t have interest income etc. if I am 100% confident that the food in itself is Halal.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA Muslim must exercise precaution in Halaal and Haraam. The food must be 100% Halaal according to the standards in Shari?ah.\n\nIn principle, if a non-Muslim informs the food is Halaal, his information is not acceptable in Shari?ah. The information of a reliable Muslim knowledgeable in issues of Halaal and Haraam is acceptable. If the food offered by a non-Muslim is, for example, vegetarian, then too the fear of contamination with Haraam is still there. It is therefore against caution to eat from non-Muslims.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
