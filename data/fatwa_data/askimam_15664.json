  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease explain to me what the role of the Ulama Council is in marital problems? What powers do the council have in terms of granting divorce, child custody and visitation, etc?\n\nÂ \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nA Ulama body is authorised by Sharia to dissolve a marriage under extreme circumstances, if the woman deserves a divorce, however her husband refuses to grant her one and no other feasible option is available.\n\nAs for the issues of custody, visitation etc, here the Ulama body could inform the parties of the Shar'i ruling on the matter and also act as an arbitrator in the matter. It however holds no legally enforceable powers.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Husain Kadodia,\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
