  "question": "If you see a dream and after waking up you realized there is wetness, does this make ghusl necessary?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI recently read an answer to a similiar question but would like clarification. The impression i got was that if a male were to sleep and ejaculate sperm (wet dream) then ghusl is fardh; this point is clear to me. The point of confusion is when, for example, in a dream you see a woman but then when you wake up you have a little wetness (not sperm but the other thin fluid). The previous answer I read stated that this makes ghusl fardh. However, if this is the case, then maulana saab this is a case of frustration for me (not because of the shari’ah mas’ala, but frustration for myself). Because, almost every night in a dream a woman is involved, sometimes in a sexual context but when I wake up there is a small amount of wetness that I can confidently say is not sperm but the other liquid. If this makes ghusl fardh, then I almost have to do ghusl every day and this at the moment is taking its toll. I feel exhausted every day and this is having an impact on salah, to the point where sometimes I neglect the ghusl and hence salah (na’oozobillah).\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\nAt the outset, it is important to understand the terms for the two types of fluid emissions which one may observe when awakening:\n\n \n\n1)     Mani (sperm)- A white, thick fluid which exits during ejaculation\n\n2)     Madhi (pre-sexual fluid)- A white, thin fluid which exits when sexually aroused but does not accompany ejaculation\n\n \n\nIf a dream is observed and one awakens with wetness of the thin fluid, it is most likely madhi and ghusl will still be mandatory just like in the case if the fluid was mani.\n\nRespected brother, there are some things in Shari’ah which may seem difficult for us. However, this is a true test from Allah Ta’ala to see if His servant will pass or fail. If one feels difficulty with making mandatory ghusl, yet wakes up, does the ghusl and prays fajr salah, Allah Ta’ala will reward him greatly. Allah is so merciful that a person who faces difficulty yet still fulfills the commands of his Lord, who knows how much more reward this person can receive!\n\n \n\nAlso, it is not necessary to take a long ghusl. One may just fulfill the necessary parts which are to rinse the nose, rinse the mouth, and wet the whole body.\n\n \n\nFurthermore, there are a few things we advise which may prevent these emissions from occurring every night. Firstly, one should balance foods which are hot and cool for the body. Do not eat a diet where hot foods dominate. Secondly, one should not eat a heavy meal just before sleeping. Thirdly, one should try to fast at least a couple of days a week.\n\n \n\nGive these advices a try and be patient. The worst thing one can do is neglect their fardh duties towards Allah. Remember, Allah Ta’ala knows His servants who are facing difficulty and will reward them with greater rewards than those who do not face it.\n\n \n\nفيجب الغسل اتفاقا فيما اذا تيقن انه متى تذكر احتلاما او لا وكذا فيما اذا تيقن انه مذي و تذكر الاحتلام\n\n (Tahtawi, p99, Qadimi Kutub)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\n \n\nMuftī Asif Umar\n\nWashington, DC (USA)\n\n \n\nConcurred by:\n\n\nMuftī Abrar Mirza\n\nChicago, IL (USA)\n\n(2010-12-09)\n\n \n\n\nUnder the Supervision of Muftī Ebrahim Desai (South Africa)\n\n \n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER – AskImam.org questions\nAskImam.org answers issues pertaining to Sharī’ah.
