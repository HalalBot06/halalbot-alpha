  "question": "Regarding Purification Bath after wet dream...In this condition can I just wash my body to attain purity?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat should a woman do when she wakes up and finds some fluid but unable to determine whether its mazi or mani? She does not recall any wet dream but remembers other dream which she saw during sleep. However before sleeping there were sexual thoughts but the fluid that was secreted at that particular time was properly washed up. In these circumstances, does the ghusl become obligatory? One more thing, is it compulsory to wash hair every time to purify myself because at times I daily experience the above stated problem but you know daily washing of hair can damage them? In this condition can I just wash my body to attain purity?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, if one has a doubt regarding the fluid being Mani or Mazi after having seen a dream, then Ghusl is compulsory.\n\nIt is necessary to wash all your hair each time Ghusl is necessary.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
