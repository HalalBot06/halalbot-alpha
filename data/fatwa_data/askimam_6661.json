  "question": "who are syeds can u explain this",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe word, Sayyed, is an Arabic word meaning master, leader, employer, etc.\n\nThe word Sayyed as a prefix or suffix to one's name generally implies to be\na descendant of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). However, that is\nnot a principle. If you do not know being a descendant of Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), you should research that. Nevertheless, there\nis no prohibition in your family name being 'Syed' and you do not have to\nremove that identity.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
