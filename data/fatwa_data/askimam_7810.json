  "question": "Are muslims allowed to work in South African banks. Can a Muslim man use the money he saved while working in a bank that thakes interest for haj.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nConventional Banks are obviously engaged in interest bearing transactions. Allah Ta?ala says in the noble Qur?aan, ?And do not aid in sin.? (Maaidah)\n\nHowever, all the income of the Bank is not Haraam. The salary of a Muslim employee will be of the Bank assumed from the Halaal portfolio. He may use that money to perform Hajj.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
