  "question": "I want to know that what are the rights of inlaws on a woman in Islam.How should she behave if they treat her badly.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIslam is a religion based on kindness, mercy, tolerance, patience, good character and the list goes on. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Show mercy on those on earth. The One in the sky (Allah) will show mercy on you.? (Mishkaat pg.423)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another Hadith, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?All the creations is the family of Allah. The most beloved creation to Allah is the one who is best to His family.? (Ibid pg.425)%0D%0A%0D%0AThese are just some of the numerous Ahaadith emphasising us to be kind and to look after the rights of others. It is, therefore, incumbent upon the in-laws to treat these daughter-in-laws with utmost respect, kindness and dignity. They ought to treat her as if she was their own daughter. They should refrain from hurting or abusing the daughter-in-law in any way. On the other hand, the daughter-in-law should also display excellent character towards her in-laws and in fact should treat them as her own parents.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf any one of the parties are shirking in their duties, then the guilty party should be reminded about accountability in the court of Allah Ta?ala. The victim should never take revenge, rather adopt the attitude of ?Be good to those who are bad to you.? Also be patient for verily Allah is with those who have patience and lastly engage in excessive du?aas and supplications.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
