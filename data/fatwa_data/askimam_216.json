  "question": "As Muslims in the western world, to what extent (if given the opportunity) can we participate for heads of office (ex. governor of state) ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA Muslim given the opportunity to a political office may do so provided he\ndoes not compromise his Islamic values and principles. Furthermore, in view\nof world politics and the sad state of Muslims, the political office could\nbe used to protect Muslims from oppression and also advance the cause of\nMuslims and Islam to the best of ones ability. Generally, people are able to\nadvance a global course only through an influential and recognised office.\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
