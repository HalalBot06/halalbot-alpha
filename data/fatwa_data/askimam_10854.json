  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu'alaikum, Why do you advise someone to recite a certain dhikr and a certain number of that dhikr - did the Prophet (saw) practice that, or exactly how do you know to do that? Jazakum'Allahu khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nCertain Zikr which are read on certain occasions, some of them have been taught to us by the Prophet (Sallahu alayhi wasallam), some of them have been inspired into the hearts of the Auliya (Friends of Allah) and some of them have been by the Auliya based on their experience and have been proved to be effective. In the latter case it should not be regarded as Sunnah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nFor-Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nChecked and approved: Moulana Emraan Vawda"
