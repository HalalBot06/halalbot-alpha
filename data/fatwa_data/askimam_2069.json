  "question": "What the conditions for considering a place a second home for kasar purposes?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was born and brought up in a city where my parents continue to live. I have moved to another city as a result of a company transfer. I go and visit my parents several times a year, and sometimes go there for a holiday. I have been advised that this city is my second home, so I should NOT read kasar when I am there. My questions are: What factors determine whether I should continue to read salaah in full or perform kasar? What happens when I travel from this city to another place within 88km from this city?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe place of birth and childhood is termed as Watan-e-Asliy and any place\nyou intend to stay in for 15 days or more is termed as Watan-e-Iqaamat. A\nperson will not make Qasr in his Watan-e-Asliy nor Watan-e-Iqaamat.\n\nIf your residence in the city of your work, though, is 15 days or longer,\nthen it will be your Watan-e-Iqaamat for that particular stay. However, if\nyou have taken up permanent residence there, the city will become your\nWatan-e-Asliy and your parent's city will no longer be your Watan-e-Asliy.\nIf you intend traveling to a destination 88 kms. or more away from either\nthe Watan-e-Iqaamat or Watan-e-Asliy, you will qualify for Qasr, otherwise\nnot.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
