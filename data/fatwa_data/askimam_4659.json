  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam alaikum, 1) I am a man with black hair. Is it permissable for men to color/dye their brown, using mendhi or peroxide products? 2) I am a 20 year old man, and intend to marry a girl who is 13 years of age. I was however informed by a fellow brother that i cannot have sex with her or have sexual fantasies about her. What age will she have to be before i am allowed to have sex with her?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Kindly refer below.\n2. If you marry the girl, you may have conjugal relationship with her. There\nis no age restriction to have a conjugal relationship with a girl of 13\nyears of age.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nPure black dye is not permissible. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam)\nsaid, \"There will be people who will come later (in my Ummah) and apply\nblack dye. They will not even smell the fragrance of paradise.\" (Abu\nDaawood). However, it is permissible for a Mujaahid (warrior) to apply black\ndye in order to give the impression of being young. (Jawahirul Fiqh vol2\npg421)\n\nTo dye the hair any other colour besides black e.g. Mehndi or Katm (type of\ngrass) is permissible. This was the practice of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu\nÁlayhi Wasallam) and the Sahaaba (Radhiyallaahu Ánhum). (Jawahirul Fiqh vol2\npg421)"
