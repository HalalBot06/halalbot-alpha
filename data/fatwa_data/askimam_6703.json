  "question": "Is it correct/permitted for a muslim brother to work for the revenue offices. 2)Is tax an oppression to us muslims.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is permissible for a Muslim to work in the revenue offices of South\nAfrica.\n2. We cannot expect to be citizens of a country and benefit from the\nservices of the government without making a contribution in the form of\ntaxes to the government. The taxes are, therefore, not oppression.\nFurthermore, the apartheid regime has deprived the indigenous people of\nSouth Africa and the Democratic government of South Africa is burderned with\na mammoth task of providing basic necessities for the majority of its\npeople.\nAs a citizen of the country, it is also our responsibility to contribute\ntowards the upliftment of our fellow citizens. Their upliftment is also in\nour personal interests, safety and security, etc. The present rate of crime\nis largely due to unemployment and poverty. As Muslims, we should pay the\nfull amount due and also make intention of charity.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
