  "question": "About Q12363 and more: The Makrooh fast is acceptable to Allah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nQ1: The Makrooh fast is acceptable to Allah? On the Day of Judgement, will Allah send the person whose fasts are all Makrooh to Hell because of the fact that he had only Makrooh fasts? Q2: In the Hanafi madhab, if a person prays at home (alone) without a valid excuse, does he have to make-up for that prayer (pray its Qadha)? Would such a namaz be considered valid and acceptable or does he have to make it up? Q3: In Ghusl, one is supposed to rinse one's mouth and nostrils properly whilst doing wudhu. Does one have to repeat these actions during the ghusl itself, after having done them during the wudhu? Or is once enough?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Yes, the fast which has become Makrooh will absolve one of his obligations. He will not be taken to task for not fulfilling the ibaadah. However, the degree of reward will be far lesser than the fast which does not have any elements that will render it Makrooh.\n\n2. According to the Hanafi Madhab, his Salaat will be accepted. However, he will be deprived of the reward of congregational prayer.\n\n3. If the Wudhu is done whilst making Ghusl, that will suffice.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
