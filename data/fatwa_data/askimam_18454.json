this in Hashar.For that do I need to join in any Jamaa't because Allah's hand on Jamaa't.Do I need any training ,if yes where I can get it.I want to improve my Eemaan as Sahaaba.So,Pls briefly answer me.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nMay Allah Ta‘ālā accept your noble intention and quest to bring complete deen into your life.  Āmīn.  Indeed, complete success lies in complete deen. \n\n \n\nThe embodiment of deen was, without a doubt, the life of the Prophet (s.a.w.).  He was a walking Qur’an and our role model of how to please our Creator.  Therefore, anyone seeking to implement complete deen into their life cannot do so unless they follow the way of the Prophet (s.a.w.).\n\n \n\nOne major aspect of the Prophet’s (s.a.w.) life was invitation and calling towards Allah (da‘wah and tablīgh).  Allah Ta‘ālā commanded the Prophet (s.a.w.) in the Qur’an saying:\n\nقُلْ هَذِهِ سَبِيلِي أَدْعُو إِلَى اللَّهِ عَلَى بَصِيرَةٍ أَنَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَنِي\n\n“Say to them, O Prophet: This is my way.  I call to Allah based on clear revealed proof—I and whoever follows me.” –Sūrah Yūsuf: 108\n\n \n\nIt is clear from this verse that one major aspect pertaining to the way of the Prophet (s.a.w.) is calling towards Allah (da‘wah), with the condition that it is done based on clear, revealed proofs.  This calling towards Allah is inclusive of inviting both Muslims and non-Muslims alike and is not restricted to one or the other.  Allah the Exalted says:\n\nوما أرسلناكَ إِلاَّ كافَّةً للنَّاس\n\n“And thus it is, O Prophet, that We have sent you to all humanity” –Sūrah Saba’: 28\n\n \n\nAllah the Exalted also states:\n\nوما أرسلناكَ إِلا رحمة للعالَمين\n\n“For We have sent you, O Prophet, as none other than a mercy to all the people of the world.” –Sūrah al-’Anbiyā: 107\n\n \n\nThese are general verses showing that the prophetic teachings are for all humanity.  Other verses illustrate that Allah Ta‘ālā is specifically inviting Muslims to inculcate complete deen and to remain steadfast on deen.  Allah the Exalted says:\n\nيَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آَمَنُوا ادْخُلُوا فِي السِّلْمِ كَافَّةً\n\n“O you who believe!  Enter into peace, all of you together. –Sūrah al-Baqarah: 208\n\n \n\nThe great Followers (Tabi‘ī) and scholars of Qur’an, Qatādah and Mujahid explain that Allah is addressing the Muslims and enjoining them to bring complete deen into their life.\n\n \n\nAllah the Exalted also says:\n\nيَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آَمَنُوا آَمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَالْكِتَابِ الَّذِي نَزَّلَ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ وَالْكِتَابِ الَّذِي أَنْزَلَ مِنْ قَبْلُ\n\n“O you who believe!  Believe steadfastly in Allah, and His Messenger, and the Book that He has, indeed, sent down to His Messenger—and every revealed Book that He has sent down before.  –Sūrah al-Nisā: 136\n\n \n\nThe great Follower, Hasan al-Basrī, explains that Allah is commanding the Muslims, who are already believers, to believe.  Therefore what is meant from Allah’s command to believe is to remain firm and steadfast on their deen. \n\n \n\nIn the light of these verses and their commentary, we understand that calling towards good (da‘wah) can also be done amongst Muslims, as Allah himself calls the Muslims towards good acts.  This is even more pertinent in our time now since Muslims are lacking the desire to practice complete deen and are no longer remaining steadfast on even the most basic injunctions.  The importance that da‘wah has in general can also be observed from the aforementioned verses, playing a significant role in adopting complete deen. \n\n \n\nWith that being said, da‘wah is something that can be performed by anyone at anytime, be it at school, at home, or at the workplace.  It is not a requirement that one must be a scholar, but whatever one calls toward should be based on sound knowledge.  We should constantly keep a close relationship with scholars in order to verify what we know and seek to find answers for that which we do not know, steadily increasing our knowledge of deen and then calling towards it.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, it is advisable to join with other brothers in a guided effort in calling towards good.  In this manner, one can work more efficiently and experience more barakah (blessings) in their endeavors.  At the same time, in a collective effort you will be able to feed off one another and support each other during times of struggle.  The most effective collective effort, easily accessible to all Muslims regardless of where they may live, in South Africa or out of South Africa, is the noble effort of da‘wah and tablīgh.  This effort was revived by Mawlana Ilyās Kandehlawi (r.a.) and in line with the teachings of our righteous predecessors.  Therefore, I would advise you or anyone else interested in involving their self in da‘wah work to join with brothers when they go in jamā‘at, or religious retreats.  Effort is primarily made amongst the Muslims, visiting them and reminding them of our duties as Muslims.  However, as was already previously mentioned, this mode of da‘wah, namely calling other Muslims towards good, is also acceptable and established in our deen. \n\n \n\nMay Allah Ta‘ālā grant you the success to implement the noble act of da‘wah into your life and use you as a means of guidance for all of mankind.  Āmīn.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\nMl.
