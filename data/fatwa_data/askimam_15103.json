  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSir, my husband and i argued one month ago, he was so angry theat he said just said talaaq, talaaq, talaaq, but after few hours he soon got back to me and said sorry to me .does this talaaq happened.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe three talaqs are valid. They constitute a talaq-e-mughallazah (permanently irrevocable divorce). You are no more husband and wife. You should separate from him and observe the laws of iddat.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
