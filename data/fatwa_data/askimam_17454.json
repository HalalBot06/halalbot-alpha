  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy name is Fahed Al Daye I want to ask you a question about the hellfire. When I was in the mosque in Montreal, one of the khetba was ended with a dua they where doing Dua to Allah (SWT). One of the dua included to seek protection from the punishment of Hellfire, to Allah (SWT). One of the Dua included the SEVERITY coldness of the hellfire. Is there any Ahadith that confirms that coldness of hellfire? Thanks in advance.\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThere are Ahadith similar in wording narrated in Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, and Sunan Tirmidhi which confirm the bitter coldness of the hellfire, also known as zamhareer.\n\nAbu Hurayrah (RadiyAllahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) said:\n\nاشتكت النار إلى ربها فقالت يا رب أكل بعضى بعضا. فأذن لها بنفسين نفس فى الشتاء ونفس فى الصيف فهو أشد ما تجدون من الحر وأشد ما تجدون من الزمهرير\n\n“The hellfire complained to its Lord and said, ‘O my Lord! My different parts consume each other’. So He permitted it to take two breaths, one breath in the winter and one breath in the summer, and this is the extreme heat you find in summer and the extreme cold you find.”\n\n(Sahih al-Bukhari, 4/106, Darul Fikr)\n(Sahih Muslim, 1/224, Maktaba Thanvi)\n(Jami’ul-Tirmidhi, 2/86, HM Saeed)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\nMl.
