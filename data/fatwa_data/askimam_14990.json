  "question": "What should i do now after giving talaaq?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat should i do now after giving talaaq?\nIts really nice that you gave time to my question. With reference of fatwa no. 14903, that i asked previously, will you please tell me what to do now?, as i m sinful according to your answer. Now time also has gone away to roll back the talaaq, so what should i do now as you said in the fatwa no. 14903 that i m sinful in giving talaaq to her.\nMy questions are,\n1)What should i do now (regarding my sins and future life)?\n2) Can i go for second marriage?\n3) After talaaq, my x-wife give me writing that she took all her things from me (that she had in my home) and tookÂ  Haq-e-Mehar also. But in real i didnot give her as she dont want it. She said that she dont want haq-e-maher. Now question is that is haq-e-maher still compulsory for me to give her after her wish to not taking it? Should i give her even she dont want it?\n4) She also wants a writing from me that she is allowed to do second marriage, is it necessary even after three talaaqs?\n5) She also wants a writing from me that there was no haml (pregnancy) in our marriage life? But its wrong, she was pregnant.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nYou should make tawba and continue with your life. Before you remarry, refer to a spiritual guide and reform yourself to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. If your ex-wife forfeited her mahr, you do not have to give her the mahr. It will be a moral and good gesture on your part to still give her the mahr and the gifts. You may oblige to her requests of 4 and 5. It is sufficient that she was not pregnant when you divorced her.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
