You should immediately stop all contact with her.\n\nIf you are interested in marrying her, consult your parents directly to communicate your intentions to her parents. You should understood that Du?aas are not given to suit your desires. How can your Du?aa become effective if you are involved in something which is expressly prohibited in the Qur?aan and Hadith.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
