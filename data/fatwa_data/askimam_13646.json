  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know that ,what is the difference between molvi and moulana?\n\n \n\nShould all molvis be regarded or called as Moulana? When some one is graduated in nizami syllabus(course) is only molvi,or the islamic graduates from other contries except indo pak sub continent,u.k,south africa Why they are not recognised or called molvi ?can we call our minors son,nephews,youger brothers ,cousinns and even female alimas MOULANA? wHY ARAB BROTHERS ARE TOO MUCH ANNOYED when wecall the alims moulna.If the moulvis or alims are moulana then what is the meaning of (LA MOULANA ALLAH MOULANA)\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are three issues in your query; a) Difference between Molvi and Moulana, b) Moulana and graduates and, c) Allah alone is Moulana.\n\nPoints 1 and 2 can be addressed only after clarifying point 3. Anyone who has basic knowledge of Arabic should know that the word Moulana emanates (Masdar) from the word Mawla. The root alphabets are ‘waa’ ‘laa’ and ‘yaa’ which means friend. This word is attributed to Allah as well as the Shaytaan in the Qur’aan. Allah says, ‘Allah is the Wali (friend) of those who bring faith.’ (Baqarah Aayat257). Allah states, ‘… And you will become a friend of Shaytaan.’ (Surah19 Aayat43).\n\nThe root word (Masdar) is Mawla and has many meanings supported by verses of the Qur’aan and Ahaadith. Allah states, ‘For everyone we have many Mawaali (plural of Mawla).’ (Surah4 Aayat33). In the commentary of this verse, Imaam Bukhari [ra] explains the meaning of the word ‘Mawlaa’ as heirs. He then enumerates many more meanings of the word Mawla – a person who takes an oath – cousin brother, master of a freed slave, a freed slave and creditor. (Bukhari vol.2 pg.658. (Shirkat Mukhtaar)\n\nWe are fully aware of the words of the Hadith ‘Allaahu Mawlaana’. This was a response of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] when Abu Sufyaan exclaimed ‘Lanaa uzza’ (name of idol) during the battle of Uhud (Bukhari vol.2 pg.579; Ibid)\n\nThe word Mawla in this context means absolute Master. This surely is the right of Allah and no one is the absolute master besides Allah. This does notmean the word ‘Mawla’ cannot be used for others in another context. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] referred to Zayd [radhiallaahu anhu] as Anta Mawlana (You are our freed slave). (Bukhari vol.2 pg.660; Ibid). An Aalim of Deen deserves respect and honour. He holds a leading position among his people. This order is replete in Shari’ah. He should be addressed with honour and respect. The title Moulana is thus given to him which means – Master and Leader. It is not contrary to Allah being our Moulana as an scholar is not referred to as an absolute master and leader just as a Master of a slave is not referred to as an absolute master. The word Moulana is an expression of honour and respect like the word ‘Shaykh’ which could mean an old person and a learned person. The word ‘Shaykh’ for a young learned person is not used in the context of being an old person. Similarly, the word Moulana should be understood in the context of the learned person being a leader and as a mark of honour and respect.\n\nThe term Molvi in Arabic will have a ‘waa’ and ‘yaa’ nisbat (attribution) at the end. It could be termed as a short form of Moulana. Every learned Aalim of Deen should be respected irrespective where he studied and where he graduated. The titles of respect may differ according to place and practice.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
