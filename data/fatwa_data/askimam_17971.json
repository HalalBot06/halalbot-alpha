  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThere are several moonsighting committees here in .  Some have restricted their horizon (matla) only North America including Chicago hilal committee. Some have extended their horizon to South America including Hilal Committee of Toronto and vicinity.\n\n\n\nBecause of this different horizon principle, sometimes even the hilal committee’s decision differ from each other for the start of Islamic months, including start of Ramadan and 2 eids.\n\nThese moonsighting committees announce their decision on internet on their website.\n\n\nIn light of fatwa # 16178 under the title (Ruling for the people of other Communities or Countries),\n\n\n·         Can the trustees of a masjid make a decision on the announcement of these hilal committees via the internet as it is very difficult to contact these committees on phone or any other source.\n\nIn light of fatwa #16976\n\n·         Can the trustees of a masjid follow the decision of any moonsighting committee if there is difference in their decision as all are reliable and all are trying to follow the sunnah way of moonsighting.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n1. As mentioned in the fatwās referred to in your query, ru'yat al-hilāl (moon-sighting) in one country is acceptable in another country if the sighting is relayed in one of the following four ways:\n\nTestimony of sighting\nIf the sky is cloudy and/or not clear, then\n\n                                                              i.      For Ramadān\n\n1.      One righteous Muslim male or female testifies that he/she has sighted the moon\n\n                                                            ii.      For 'Īd\n\n1.      Two male or one male and two female righteous Muslims testify that they have sighted the moon\n\n \nIf the sky is clear, then a large group of people testify that they have all sighted the moon\nTestimony on [someone else's] testimony\nFor Ramadān\n\n                                                              i.      One righteous person testifies that one righteous person testified to him that he/she has sighted the moon\n\n \nFor 'Īd\n\n                                                              i.      Two male or one male and two female righteous persons testify that two male or one male and two female righteous Muslims have testified sighting the moon\n\nTestimony on the authority's decision\nTwo righteous persons testify that the Muslim authority in charge of moon-sighting has declared the start of the new month\nWidespread news\nLarge groups of people coming from the country where the moon has been sighted inform that the people of that country have started the new month\n\n \n\nThe above four ways are the methods of actually declaring a moon-sighting.  A moon-sighting cannot be declared by just reading it on a website.  However, when the country's hilāl committee declares a sighting based on the above four methods, then it is permissible to announce that decision through the use of the internet and other resources. \n\n \n\nIt is not valid for a Masjid to visit the site of a hilāl committee of another country and announce the decision.  Instead, it should refer to the website of the local/national hilāl committee and announce its decision.\n\n \n\n2. The trustees of the Masjid should follow only one moon-sighting committee in all of their decisions.  It is not correct to pick and choose decisions of different committees, in cases of disagreements between the committees, as this will lack consistency and could lead to problems, such as some months being shorter than twenty-nine (29) days or longer than thirty (30). \n\n \n\nRegardless of which moon-sighting committee or ruling (in terms of matla') the Masjid follows, it should maintain consistency and follow that committee for the starting and ending of each month. \n\n \n\n(رد المحتار، كتاب الصوم: 2/385-391؛ سعيد)\n\n \n\n(فتاوى رحيمية، كتاب الصوم: 7/215-218؛ الإشاعت)\n\n \n\n(البحر الرائق، كتاب الصوم: 2/287؛ المعرفة)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
