  "question": "What is taqwa? And how can a young individual who is into the work of tableegh achieve taqwa?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMoulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi (RA) said that the Haqeeqat (reality) of Taqwa is for Tayaqquz (alertness) to be created in all facets of life. This means that one should ponder upon every step whether this is for Allah or for the Nafs or how much is for Allah and how much is for the Nafs.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) asked Hadhrat Ka?b Ahbaar (Radhiallaahu Anhu), ?What is the reality of Taqwa?? He said, ?Have you ever passed a thorny tree?? He answered, ?Yes?. He asked, ?How did you pass?? He answered, ?I passed with such care that I ensured that no thorn got caught into my hem.? He said, ?In the very same way, the reality of Taqwa is for one to save himself from the thorns of sins and negligence. The companionship of the pious plays a vital role for inculcating Taqwa. Alhamdulillah, with the effort of Tabligh, such sincere servants are present who reminds one of the Aakhirat and removes negligence from the heart. Hence, remain steadfast on the teachings and Mashwara of the elders and constantly spend time in the path of Allah through which, Insha Allah, Allah will bless one with this great quality of Taqwa.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
