  "answer": "QUESTION\nALLAHU LA ILAHA ILLA HUWAL HAYYUL QAYYUM! HASBI-ALLAHU LAA ILAHA ILLA HU ALAIHI TAWAKKALTU WAHUWA RABBUL ARSHIL AZEEM! Is it acceptable to perform dhikr of the above Ayats from the Qur?an? In general, can one perform constant dhikr of certain Ayats or Surahs from the Qur?an?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dua -La-ilaha illa-anta.was made by Hadhrath Yunus (AS) when he was in\nthe belly of a fish. The dua, Inna Lilahi.is read when one hears sad news.\nThe dua- Allahu-laailaila. is also mentioned in the Quran and is effective\nfor safety and protection. The last dua in reference is the last verse of\nsura Tawba. Some duas are recited for specific instances and are not\ngeneral. The duas that are general may be recited at any time or in any way,\nindividually or in gathering on condition one does not regard the practice\nas compulsory by insisting people participate in the act and reproach those\nwho do not participate. If one insists, then that will be bidah as it is\ndistortion of deen by expressing a non-compulsory act as compulsory, which\nis a sin.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
