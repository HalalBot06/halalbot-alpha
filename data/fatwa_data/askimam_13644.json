  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is the ruling for a Muslim living in the westÂ and who was sexualy aroused during ramadan and he is not married. He finds nothing else and resorts to masturbation in which he ejaculates. He is aware that masturbation breaks his fast, and it only happened once during last Ramadan. Does he make up for the one day, or does he have to give Kaffara? and what is the Kaffara? The brother has already paid money to feed one poor person for 60days, and he is hurting in his heart because of this sin, and he has made tawba.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to Shariah, if one masturbates while fasting, the fast will become invalidated. However, only Qadha will become necessary not Kaffarah. (Nurul Iddah Pg. 145)\n\nIt is important that you abstain from those places that incite your passion and desire. You should make a concerted effort to stop this filthy act of masturbation. If you have the financial ability to marry, consult your parents and look for a suitable partner and marry as soon as possible.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
