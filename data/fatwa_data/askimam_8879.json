  "question": "1. Is Tabligh Jamath supports the Jihad (holy war)? 2. Is there anything called Islamic dress?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear muft sab, Asslaamu alaikum(w.r.w.b), I have two question here, 1. I asked one of my 'tableeghi' brother why tableegh jamat is not allowing to go for the holy war (jihad). He said until the whole islamic community doesn't come under one imam there is no permission to give fatwa of going to jihad. Is he correct? Otherwise pls give me your explanations why tableegh jamaat is not giving permission to go for jihad. I heard, in his last serman our prophet mohammed (sal) had said that jihad is compulsory on every muslim when other muslims are in trouble. 2. Is there anything called Islamic dress? Two of my friends had argument that one said the 'pattan-suit' which the pakistanis and most of the north indian muslims wear is the islamic dress. The other said, whichever (even pant-shirt) comes under islamic shariath of dress is islamic dress. Who is correct in these two?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Presently, Jihaad is not compulsory upon every single Muslim. It is compulsory upon those who are directly brutalised and harassed by the disbelievers. Jihaad is compulsory upon them. If they do not suffice, Muslims geographically closest to them are obliged to take up arms and if they are also not sufficient, Muslims closest to this second group should go in Jihaad and so froth. So, since Jihaad is not presently compulsory upon every single Muslim, the Tablighi brother mentioned what he mentioned.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. There is no strict Islamic dress as such. One may wear whatever is available provided it conceals the Satr, does not go lower than the ankles and is not the exclusive dress of the disbelievers. However, a loose-fitting shirt with broad sleeves without cuffs and tails hanging down to a point between the knees and the ankles is generally regarded as an Islamic dress. The Pataan suit is more a cultural dress than an Islamic dress.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Kadwa%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
