  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is the ruling about having Quran on the mobile phones/digital devices either in audio form or in digital form? Would it be valid or sinful to take such devices to the toilet? The quran is not visible, though it is stored in digital form on the memory till the application is activated.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is permissible to have the Quraan on the mobile phone though it is discouraged. This is due to the loose handling of the phone which indirectly would be tantamount to disrespect of the Quraan. The Quraan is the word of Allah and demands the highest form of respect. Technology has advanced so rapidly and seems so attractive yet if we look deep into these very same devices they are stripping us of the modesty, respect, reverence that we once boasted off. If one has loaded the Quraan on the mobile, it will not be permissible to take the mobile into the toilet.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
