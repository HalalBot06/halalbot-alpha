  "question": "Can a Muslim share an apartment with polytheists?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsallamu Alaikum, I am a college student who is living on campus in a dorm room. As school is closing, I need to live off campus for the rest of the summer, but I am having trouble finding an apartment. I know a Muslim brother who is renting out a house to Hindus, and he offered me a room in the house. The rent is very cheap. I was wondering, if under any circumstances, \"Can a Muslim live in a house with polytheists?\"\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOne should avoid sharing a house with non-Muslim as you would be sharing\nvarious common facilities, e.g. Kitchen, bathroom, etc. That may lead to\nunnecessary problems, for example, they will bring in food that is not\nHalaal and use the utensils that you may use which could lead to\ncontamination.\n\nIn the presence of so many 'may-be's and 'could's, it is advisable not to\nshare the room with them. However, if there is no alternative, you may share\nthe room with them and guard against Halaal and Haraam as well as your\nImaan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
