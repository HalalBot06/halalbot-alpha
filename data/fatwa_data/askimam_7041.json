  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have been told that there are 6 hadeeth (Tarmizi, Bhukari, Abu Dawud, Muslim, Mishkaat, and Ibn Dawud). I wish to know if these are the only authenticised Ahdeeth? Who authenticised them or how did they come about to be authentic?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are many authentic compilations of Hadith besides the abovementioned 6%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen we say ?authentic compilations?, we mean that the authors of these compilations are authentic and that the attribution of those compilations to those particular authors is correct.
