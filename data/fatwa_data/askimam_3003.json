  "question": "If I have my periods for only 5 days do I have to perform ghusal after the fifth day.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs Salaam Alaikum Dear Mufti sahib my periods come only for five days. Should I perform ghusal after the fifth day? Or do I have to perform ghusal on the 8th day because my mother asked me to perform ghusal on the 8th day. If we are to perform ghusal right after our periods are over than are we suppose to perform all our Qada Prayers which I didn?t perform because I thought that I had to take bath on the 8th day.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf you have menses only for five days, then you should take a bath upon your\nmenses stopping and resume Salaat immediately.\n\nYou should not wait till the eight day. If you did so, then you must make\nQadhaa for all the Fardh and Witr Salaats from after the expiry of Iddat\ntill the eighth day.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
