The Tax laws have been prescribed by the Government of your country which you must abide by. You may obtain advice from your accountant or a tax consultant on issues of managing your finance and other tax related matters.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nÂ \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
