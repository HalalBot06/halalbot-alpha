  "question": "Salam, I had a dream that my father died on Eid and also it was my birthday and school was open.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI had a dream that it was the first day of Eid-Ul-Fitar,and before the Namaz my father somehow died and we didn't pray, atleast i didn't pray Eid's Namaz. People were sad. My uncle and cousin took me to school that wasn't mine but friends and teachers were the same from my school. They had a cake with one candle, I made a wish out loud that I wanted to be with my father but I got scared that wish might come true and I might die or he might come back from Heaven(somehow i was exactly sure that he was in Heaven). After that I cried after every one minute. Then after school I was in Pakistan and was going to my childhood park and on the way i was crying. (please tell me what it means).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nGenerally, to see death in one's dream is a reminder of death. It is a\nmotivation to be conscious of death in order to be straight and upright.\n\nThe more conscious a person is of death, the more upright he will be in\nfulfilling the orders of Allah Ta'ala.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
