  "question": "the supplier is too lazy (because they don’t know how to get a very specific item), they will ask us to buy it for them. Again, the same thing happened! Sometimes, its cheaper ... Can we keep the left over money for ourselves",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nOur government-based research centre deals with buying items for the research. For this purpose, the office appointed a supplier and they agree on a specific price. The office then leave it to the supplier how will he get he item, and how much does he actually buy it (off course, it will be cheaper in order for them to get the profit). In some occasion, the supplier is too lazy (because they don’t know how to get a very specific item), they will ask us to buy it for them. Again, the same thing happened! Sometimes, its cheaper ...  Can we keep the left over money for ourselves ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf the government research centre and the supplier agreed on a price for an item and it is also understood that the supplier is a liberty to obtain the item at a cheaper price and keep the surplus amount for himself, then that is permissible. The supplier may appoint a third person to purchase the item and pay him an agency fee.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
