  "question": "Would you please furhter explain your answer to my question(RE: Question # 4665)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Sahib: Jazakallah-O-Khair, for your prompt response to my questions. I'm a bit more confused with the answer to the first question, as you mentioned that these answers were in accord with Hanafi Madhaab, at the bottom of your reply. This has compelled me to further ask the following questions: . Do the other three madaahibs(Shaafaee, Malikee, & Hanablee) permit the recitation of Quraan by the Imaam, by looking into it while leading the salaat? . Do these madaahibs consider salaat offerred in this mannar valid or null and viod? . Would salaat offerred by Hanafees behind such an Imaam be vaild, or does one needs to return it? Your prompt and detailed reply to the above listed questions, is very much appreciated. Jazakallah-O-Khairan. Wa-As-Salaam-O-Alaykum\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Kindly note that we issue rulings only according to the Hanafi Madhab.\n2. If a person follows an Imaam of a different Madhab (school of thought),\nit is correct, until it is known that the Imaam has done such an act which\nwill nullify Salaat in the Madhab of the follower (Muqtadi). (Shaami vol.1\npg.563; HM Saeed)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
