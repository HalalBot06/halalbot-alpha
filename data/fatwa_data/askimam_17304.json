One will be a group who will have whips like the tails of cattle and they would hit people with those whips and a woman who would be dressed but (in reality) will be naked, strange men will be inclined towards her and she would be inclined towards strange men, their heads (hair style) would look like the humps of camels, these people will not enter Jannah neither would they enjoy the fragrance of paradise…..”. Sahih Muslim\n\n \n\nصحيح مسلم - (ج 14 / ص 229 )\n\nحَدَّثَنِى زُهَيْرُ بْنُ حَرْبٍ حَدَّثَنَا جَرِيرٌ عَنْ سُهَيْلٍ عَنْ أَبِيهِ عَنْ أَبِى هُرَيْرَةَ قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ -صلى الله عليه وسلم- « صِنْفَانِ مِنْ أَهْلِ النَّارِ لَمْ أَرَهُمَا قَوْمٌ مَعَهُمْ سِيَاطٌ كَأَذْنَابِ الْبَقَرِ يَضْرِبُونَ بِهَا النَّاسَ وَنِسَاءٌ كَاسِيَاتٌ عَارِيَاتٌ مُمِيلاَتٌ مَائِلاَتٌ رُءُوسُهُنَّ كَأَسْنِمَةِ الْبُخْتِ الْمَائِلَةِ لاَ يَدْخُلْنَ الْجَنَّةَ وَلاَ يَجِدْنَ رِيحَهَا وَإِنَّ رِيحَهَا لَيُوجَدُ مِنْ مَسِيرَةِ كَذَا وَكَذَا »\n\nThe Hadith is clear that a woman who exposes herself to strange men (men she is allowed to marry), will enter hell.\n\n \n\n2.      You state that your parents had obtained an interest bearing loan in the face of extreme difficulty and dire need. We cannot comment as we do not know the real nature of the need. However, that would not undo the interest loan taken. Since the loan is taken, one should sincerely repent and make Tawbah to Almighty Allah. Furthermore, a concerted effort should be made to pay off this Haraam loan as quickly as possible. The family should sacrifice its luxuries and use the funds wasted in futile items to pay off the interest bearing loan. Often we observe that people take out interest bearing loans but continue with a lavish and exorbitant lifestyle. Surely this reflects the in sincerity of the tawbah and level of remorse and commitment. You should advise your family with regards to the above and encourage them on working towards settling the debt as soon as possible. If you are committed and sincere in doing so, Allah will create the means and avenues from His unseen treasures.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\n \n\n\n\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaaa"
