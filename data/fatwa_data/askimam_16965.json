  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question is that is it ok to perform salat(Namaz) in shorts if the length cover the knees.\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIn order for salaah to be valid the satr must be covered. The satr for a male is from the navel till below the knees. This is clearly substantiated in a hadeeth: \n\nقال النبي صلي الله عليه وسلم :عورة الرجل ما بين سرةه الا ركبته .اخرجه الدار قطني.\n\n(Al Hidaayah V3-4 Pg 460 Shirkat e Ilmiyah)\n\nThe shorts covering the knees will fulfil this minimum requirement. However salaah is a means of communication with our creator.  One should adorn such attire that invokes the mercy of Allah Taala.To adorn oneself with the sunnah attire is a mark of respect for Allah Taala.\n\nTherefore to suffice on the shorts is undesirable.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
