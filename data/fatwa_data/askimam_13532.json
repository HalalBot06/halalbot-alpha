  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCurrently i am in saudi arabia and i am sending zakat to india to my brother so that he can distribute to needy muslim.\n\nThis time i am planning to send some part of zakat to india and some part i want to give it myself when i go to india inshaallah after hajj so is this permissible. keep in mind that i am always taking out zakat money in ramadan.\n\nThis is because whenever i go to india people expect something from me so this time i want to distribute myself some zakat.\n\nOne more thing i have my own house in india which i purchased for my use but now i am in saudi arabia and it is not used so do i have to give zakat for that house.\n\nPlease reply as soon as possible\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYou may take out your zakaat in ramadaan and keep part of it to distribute in personally when you go to India.\n\nThere is no zakaat on the house you purchased in India.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
