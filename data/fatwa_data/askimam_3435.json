  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow many days we can do jammu kasr. I am in Mumbai now and having a tight schedule for 1 1/2 months, i want to know how many days we can do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA person becomes a Musaafir if he undertakes a journey a journey of 88 kms.\nor more. According to the Hanafi Madhab, a Musaafir must make Qasr (shorten)\nhis Dhuhr, Asr and Esha Salaats from four Rakaats to two Rakaats. He has no\noption.\n\nAccording to the other Madhaahib, Shaaf'ee, etc. a Musaafir has an option to\nperform full Salaats or make Qasr. In view of the differences of opinion and\nin view of the many Salaats performed by the Musaafir, there is a leeway to\nregard the previously performed full Salaats as valid. However, for the\nfuture, it is advisable that a Muqeem be appointed to perform the Asr\nSalaats.\n\nIf a person stays at one place for a minimum of 15 days, he will become a\nMuqeem. A Muqeem has to perform full Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
