  "question": "Most of their arguments are illogical and i try to avoid their comments. Still some of the brother and sisters try to argue with them but in vein they always insult Islam. What would be our position in this regard?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI often visit an islamic forum online where other muslim brothers and sisters also discuss about Islam and islamic lifestyle but the problem is there are many non muslims who directly put negative comments about Allah(swt) and Muhammad(PBUH). Most of their arguments are illogical and i try to avoid their comments. Still some of the brother and sisters try to argue with them but in vein they always insult Islam. What would be our position in this regard? Do you think i should totally stop accessing the forum? I found other muslim brother/sisters, non muslims are very interested in Islam and they need help so in a sense the forum is also useful. Whenever i face question i try to consult your web site and refer them your web site. do you think this is okay?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nGenerally there are two types of individuals\n\nA) Rationale, accommodating another view, argue on sound academic principles and are in search of the truth\n\nB) Stubborn, proud, non accommodating, debate without any sound academic basis and argue to cause confusion and mischief\n\nIn view of the above, if people of understanding and those who are search in the truth log onto the Islamic forum and you are well equipped with authentic Islamic knowledge to convince them that Allah is our Creator and Islam is the true Deen, there is no harm in visiting the site. However, if this is not the case, you should not waste your valuable time in trying to convince stubborn and proud people who in all probabilities will not take heed of your view point. Time is valuable and although Allah being free from oath, takes an oath of time in the Quraan. Therefore rather use your time constructively in making Ibaadah and/or increase your Deeni knowledge. It is our experience that the positive outcomes of such forums are minimal. Rasulullah (Salalaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said \"value free time before work overtakes you\".\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
