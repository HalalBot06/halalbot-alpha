  "question": "Why is a women not allowed to attend a funeral?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nA Muslim female may visit the home of the deceased. As regards to visiting the graveyard, hereunder is a reply to a similar question - below.\n\nIbn Mas'ood (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said, 'I used to stop you from visiting graves, (now) visit the graves for it creates abstention (love) for the world and reminds of the hereafter. (Mishkaat)\n\nFrom the above Ahaadith, it is clear that visiting graves was prohibited for all (men and women), and thereafter the prohibition was abrogated.Therefore, it is Mustahabb for males to visit graves. With regard to females, see the following Ahaadith:\n\nAbu Huryara (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) cursed women who visit the graveyards. (Mishkaat p. 154 - Qadeemi)\n\nAaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha) said to Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) 'Oh Prophet of Allah what should I say when visiting the graves', Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said, 'Assalaamu Alaa ahlud diyaar minal mu'mineena wal muslimeena wayarhamu Allaahu al-mustaqdimeena minnaa wal must'akhireena, wa innaa inshaa'a Allaahu bikum lalaahiqoon.\n\nWhile Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) taught  Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha) the Du'a when visiting the graves, he also cursed females from doing so.The reason for prohibiting females from visiting graves is due to our corrupted environment wherein women who do not adhere to the laws of Hijaab and hence strange men are attracted towards them.\n\nIf the laws of the Shariah (Hijaab, intermingling, crying, etc.) are not violated then the prohibition may be set aside. Since generally the women visiting the graves are not free from the above aspects, they should refrain from doing so. \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best,\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
