I have been told that women do not need to pray in this jamaat with the men. I was told that women should pray after the men complete their salaat in jamaat. Please assist me. Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is advisable for a female to perform her Salaat individually. However, if she performs Salaat in congregation behind a male, it will be valid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
