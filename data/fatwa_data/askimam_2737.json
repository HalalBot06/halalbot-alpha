  "answer": "QUESTION\nYet you mentioned in a different fatwa that television and photos are the same. Please explain the difference between images on a TV and on a computer. Can I also use physical training videos to do fitness training and martial arts as I do not have the time to go to clubs? If I go to clubs, it conflicts with namaz time and I would like to stay fit by training at home. These videos provide instruction as well as motivation. I try not to watch TV for entertainment purposes.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nThere are many other factors besides pictures and photos for television\nbeing Haraam.\n\nWe reiterate that the images that appear in tvs and videos and computers are\nnot Tasweer (pictures) which is prohibited in Shari'ah. It is permissible to\nfollow educational instructions from computers and videos on condition there\nis nothing un-Islamic in it.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
