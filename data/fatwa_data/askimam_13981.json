  "question": "Is the knowledge in lawh-e-mahfooz more than the knowledge given to the last Prophet saws, or is it less?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. Is the knowledge in lawh-e-mahfooz more than the knowledge given to the last Prophet saws, or is it less?\n\n2. Is the lawh-e-mahfooz created or uncreated?\n\n3. If the knowledge of the Prophet saws is greater than the knowledge in lawh-e-mahfooz, and since the lawh-e-mahfooz contains the destinies of all mankind, does that mean the Prophet saws knows the destinies of all people including himself?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAt the outset, it should be understood that the knowledge of Allah is complete, e.g. Allah only knows when Qiyaamah will take place or when a person dies. Therefore, the knowledge contained in the lawh mahfooz is also in the knowledge of Allah, it should be known that the knowledge given to Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] is also vast and extensive, e.g. he knew the signs of Qiyaamah, Jannah, Jahannum, etc. So, his knowledge of Ilmul Ghayb was also extensive but unlike the knowledge of Allah.\n\n1. All future events are preserved in the lawh mahfooz and this is more than the knowledge of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam].\n\n2. Yes, the lawh mahfooz is created.
