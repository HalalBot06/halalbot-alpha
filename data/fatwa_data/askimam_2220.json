  "answer": "QUESTION\nTo be more specific, this person is an elderly gentelmen, his age is 68. This individual has to do wudu everytime he has to pray due to this condition. Also he can keep his wudu and pray his salat of four rakats soon after he looses his wudu. Now while he is the rush of Hajj does he have to keep refreshing his wudu to perform it, for example while doing tawaf or going from safa to marwa. Basically all through out the journey what are the conditions and what is he permitted or has to do if he is in this condition. Jazakallah hu khairan.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRULES RELATING TO THE MA'ZUR%0D%0A1. If someone's nose begins to bleed in such a way that it doesn't stop, or%0D%0Ahas a wound from which blood flows continuously, or is afflicted by the%0D%0Asickness of urine dripping continuously - and in all these cases he does not%0D%0Ahave such a time wherein he could offer his salaat with (complete) purity -%0D%0Athen such a person is called a ma'zur (excused). The rule in regard to him%0D%0Ais that he should make Wudhu for the time of every salaat. As long as that%0D%0Asalaat time remains, his Wudhu will remain. However, if apart from this%0D%0Asickness, some other matter crops up which causes Wudhu to break, then his%0D%0AWudhu will break and he will have to repeat it. An example of this is: a%0D%0Aperson's nose began to bleed continuously and refused to stop. At Zuhr time%0D%0Ahe made Wudhu. So as long as the Zuhr time remains, his Wudhu will not break%0D%0Aas a result of the bleeding nose. However, if (in that Zuhr time) the person%0D%0Awent to the toilet, or pricked himself with a needle and blood flowed, then%0D%0AWudhu will break and will have to be repeated. When this time passes, and%0D%0Athe next salaat time comes, then another Wudhu will have to be made (for%0D%0Athis second salaat time). In like manner, Wudhu should be made for every%0D%0Asalaat time. With this Wudhu, one can read any number and any type of%0D%0Asalaat - irrespective of Fard or nafl salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. If Wudhu was made at Fajr time, then after sunrise, salaat cannot be read%0D%0Awith that Wudhu. A fresh avdu will have to be made. If Wudhu was made after%0D%0Asunrise, then it would be permissible to read Zuhr with that Wudhu and%0D%0Athere's no need to make a fresh Wudhu for Zuhr. When Asr time enters, then%0D%0Aonly will it be necessary to make a fresh Wudhu. However, if Wudhu breaks%0D%0Afor some other reason (eg. urinating or passing stool), then fresh Wudhu%0D%0Awill have to be made (as mentioned above).%0D%0A%0D%0A3. A person had a wound which bled continuously. So he made Wudhu.%0D%0AThereafter, another wound emerged and began to bleed. The Wudhu will break%0D%0Aand will have to be made again.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. A person will only be classified as a ma'zur and this ruling will only%0D%0Aapply to him when one complete time passes wherein the blood flows%0D%0Acontinuously, and he is unable to read the salaat of that time in complete%0D%0Apurity. If such a time is found wherein salaat could be offered with%0D%0Acomplete purity, then he won't be classified as a Ma'zur. Whatever rules%0D%0Athat have just been mentioned, will not apply to him. However, if one%0D%0Acomplete time passed, wherein he did not get the opportunity to offer salaat%0D%0Ain total purity, then he will be classified as a ma'zur. Now, the same rules%0D%0Aapply to him, i.e. make a fresh Wudhu for every salaat time. When the next%0D%0Asalaat time comes, then it is not a pre-requisite that blood should flow at%0D%0Athe time. In fact, if in that entire period, blood only flows once, and%0D%0Astops flowing for the rest of the time - then too the person will be%0D%0Aclassified as a Ma'zur. However, if after this, an entire time passes in%0D%0Awhich no blood flowed at all, then the person will not remain in Ma'zur. Now%0D%0Athe ruling will be that each time blood flows, Wudhu will break.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Dhuhr time had already entered and only after that the blood of the wound%0D%0Abegan to flow. So he should wait till the end of the time. If it stops, well%0D%0Aand good. And if it doesn't stop, then he should make Wudhu and offer his%0D%0Asalaat. Now, if it continued flowing during the entire time of Asr and to%0D%0Athe extent that he could not perform his Asr salaat, then when the Asr time%0D%0Apasses, he will be classified as a Ma'zur. If the blood stops flowing in the%0D%0Avery time of Asr, then he won't be regarded as a ma'zur and whatever salaats%0D%0Ahe may have read in this time will not be proper and will have to be%0D%0Arepeated.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. On account of urinating or passing stool, a ma'zur made Wudhu. At the%0D%0Atime of making Wudhu, the bleeding had stopped. After completing Wudhu, the%0D%0Ablood started to flow again. By the flowing of this blood, Wudhu will break.%0D%0AHowever, that Wudhu which was made on account of the bleeding of the nose,%0D%0Aetc.; that particular Wudhu will not break on account of bleeding of the%0D%0Anose.%0D%0A%0D%0A7. If this blood falls on the clothing, etc. then check: if it will fall%0D%0Aagain before he can complete his salaat, then it won't be wajib to wash it%0D%0Aoff. But if he knows that it won't fall again so quickly and that salaat%0D%0Acould be performed in purity, then it will be wajib to wash it off. If the%0D%0Aextent of the blood is more than the size of a fifty cents coin then salaat%0D%0Awill not be complete without washing it off.%0D%0A"
