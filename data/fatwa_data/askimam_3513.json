What if you can't pray because of class or work or in any case you only have enough time to pray the Fardh?...please explain in details jazakallah khairun\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA person only becomes sinful when he deliberately leaves out the\nSunnat-e-Muakkadah continuously. If due to unavoidable circumstances he\nomits them once in a while, then he will not be regarded as sinful. (Shaami\nvol.2 pg.451; Multan). The four Sunnats before Jummu'ah Salaat and the four\nand two Sunnats after the Jummu'ah Salaat are Sunnat-e-Muakkadah.\n\nThe person should first speak to his employer or teacher humbly appealing to\nthem to extend his leave time by at least ten minutes. He may suggest that\nhe is prepared to work overtime to cover the time lost. He should do all\nthat is in his power to be able to read the Sunan of Jummu'ah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
