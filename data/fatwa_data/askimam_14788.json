He was the freed slave of Nabi sallalahu alaihi wa sallam.\n\nJauhar means jewel/matter/element. After researching the books on the biographies of the Sahaba radhiallahu anhu, we were unable to locate a Sahabi with this name. (usd al-ghabah, al-Isabah)\n\nZuhayr means bud/small flower. There are over twenty Sahaba that have shared this name. (al-Isabah)\n\nÂ \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
