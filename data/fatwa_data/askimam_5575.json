  "question": "It was not due to milk but by My Order. Tableghi people say that the pious man did a shirk that is why Allah caught him",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome tableghi jamat people say in their beyans (speeches) that there was a pious man who was so Abid. Once he drank milk and after some time he felt pain in his belly. He said that I am feeling pain in my belly and it is due to the milk drunk by me. When that person was died, Allah SWT caught him and said to him why did you say that I am feeling pain in my belly due to the milk. It was not due to milk but by my order. Certainly all the happenings are by the order of Allah SWT. Those tableghi people say that the pious man did a shirk that is why Allah SWT caught him. I want to ask two questions about this. (1) Is this story or occurrence (happening) is true i.e. have you ever passed over this in any book. (2) If yes, is it really shirk i.e. can you not say about any creature it is due to this but in your heart you believe in that every happening is by the order of Allah SWT and this creature is only a means or source.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Yes, we have also come across this story.\n2. For ordinary people like us, such incidents are not deemed Shirk. Since\nthe pious man had a very high level of Tawakkul and proximity to Allah, he\nwas taken to task even for thinking in this manner. There are external\ncauses for everything. For instance, fire burns but in reality it is Allah\nwho makes it happen. In the incident in question, the pious person was taken\nto task merely because he shifted his focus from Allah to the milk. It did\nnot behove his level of Tawakkul to think in this manner even if the milk\nwas the external cause of his pain. In short, one may believe that\neverything has an external cause but in reality it is Allah Ta'ala who makes\nthings happen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
