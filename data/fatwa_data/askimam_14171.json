  "question": "If I don’t get a chance to read at mosque I read at home. Am I allowed to do jamat at home with my wife as an imam normally would?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. If I don’t get a chance to read at mosque I read at home. Am I allowed to do jamat at home with my wife as an imam normally would? If yes then who does azan/iqamat? 2. If someone goes for umra, is it more encouraging for him to do maximum umras or just one umra and maximum tawafs? 3. Is there any dua my wife can read to get pregnant quicker? My wife tells me that some women use fresh alcohol after birth as an antiseptic for the vaginal area (they put it on a cotton pad and place it under the vagina). They say this is good because it prevents swelling of the rest of the body. At the moment I strongly oppose this, as it seems odd but want to ask you to make sure. jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. It is advisable for a woman to perform her Salaat by herself. However, if she performs her Salaat with you, the Salaat will be valid. In that case, your wife should not stand next to you or slightly behind you. She should stand directly behind you. You should call out the Adhaan and Iqaamat.\n\n2. It is preferable to do more Tawaafs than more Umrahs.\n\n3. Pregnancy and the time of conception is by the Divine order of Allah. Your wife should turn and make sincere du’aa to Allah. Allah appreciates sincerity and showers His sincere slaves with His bounties and favours.\n\n4. It is permissible to use alcohol for medical reasons.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
