  "question": "How do you perform Tahajjud Salaah and at what time do you perform it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nALLAH’S MERCY AT THE TIME OF TAHAJJUD\n\nRasulullah [salallahu alaihi wasallam] said, “At night there is such a\nmoment in which a Muslim supplicates Allah Ta’ala for the good of this world\nor the Hereafter, Allah Ta’ala will grant him his request, and this moment\nappears every night.” [Muslim]\n\nNote: This Hadith bears the good fortune of acceptance of ones Duas at\nnight. However, mention is not made of the specific moment of acceptance.\nSome Ulama are of the opinion that this period is not known like that of\nLailatul Qadr and the special moment of acceptance on Jumua, while others\nopine that it is at midnight. [Mazahir]\n\nIn another Hadith, Rasulullah [salallahu alaihi wasallam] said, “The closest\nAllah Ta’ala gets to his servant is in the last portion of the night. If you\npossess the ability to be from among those who remember Allah, then become\none of them.” [Tirmidhi]\n\nNote: “The closeness of Allah” refers to Allah’s pleasure and mercy showered\nupon his servants who sacrifice their sleep and strive in His worship.\n[Mazahir]\n\nRasulullah [salallahu alaihi wasallam] said, “When one third of the night\nremains our Rabb [Lord], Most High, Most Exalted, descends to the first sky\nand announces, “Who is there to beseech Me that I may answer his prayer and\nwho is there to seek forgiveness that I may forgive him.’ Then He spreads\nout His hands [of kindness and mercy] and proclaims, “Who will grant a loan\nto the One who is neither a destitute or an oppressor.” [Muslim]\n\nNote: 1. Allah Ta’ala is free from bodily form and shape. He is Omnipresent\nand He is not confined to space. Hafiz Ibne Hajar and Imaam Malik\n[rahmatullah alaihimal have stated that “Allah Ta’ala descending to the\nfirst sky” signifies His special Mercy through which He accepts Duas and\nforgives sins. [Lam’aat]\n\n2. The loan mentioned in the Hadith refers to bodily and financial devotions\noffered to Allah Ta’ala with the hope of attaining rewards.[Mazahir]\n\nTHE CORRECT TIME FOR TAHAJJUD\n\nThe time of Tahajjud extends from the time of Isha until SUBHE SADIQ [true\ndawn]. Ahadith related from Hadhrat Aa’isha [radhiyallahu anha] state that\nNabie [salallahu alaihi wasallam] sometimes performed Tahajjud in the early\nportion of the night and on occasions when half the night had passed.\nHowever, towards the latter part of his life he frequently performed it in\nthe last portion of the night. As the night progresses, Allah Ta’ala’s Mercy\nand Blessings increase. Hence, the last sixth of the night is most\npreferred. [Maktoobat Shaikh ul Islaam 77 p 202 – Fatawa Rahimiya vol 2 p\n376]\n\nDUA TO ASSIST ONE IN AWAKENING FOR TAHAJJUD\n\nA person remarked to Abdullah bin Abbas [radhiyallahu anhu], “I always\nintend awakening in the last portion of the night to perform Salaat but\nsleep overpowers me.” Ibne Abbas [radhiyallahu anhu] replied, “Before\nsleeping recite from “QUL LAW KAANAL BAHRU MIDADAL…” to the end of Surah\nKahf. Allah Ta’ala will waken you at whatever time you intend rising.”\n[Tha’labi-Ma’ariful Quraan vol 5]\n\nNUMBER OF RAKAATS IN TAHAJJUD\n\nThe number of rakaats performed by Nabie [salailahu alaihi wasallam] varied\naccording to the prevailing circumstances. Although on certain occasions\nsufficient time was available, Nabie [salailahu alaihi wasallam] would\nperform less rakaats reciting lengthy Qiraat.[Khasa’ile Nabawee p 156]\n\nDeducing from the various narrations four to twelve rakaats in units of two\nor four have been recommended. [Imdaadul Fatawa vol 1 -Baab finnawaafil /\nMaraqiyul Falah], However if two rakaats are performed in the prescribed\ntime it will be regarded as Tahajjud.[Raddul Mukhtaar vol 1 p 715]\n\nOCCASIONS WHEN ONE IS UNABLE TO AWAKEN FOR TAHAJJUD\n\nHadhrat Aa’isha [radhiyallahu anhal relates, “If for some reason Rasulullah\n[salallahu alaihi wasallam] was unable to perform Tahajjud, he would perform\ntwelve rakaats during the day [at the time of Chaast – before midday”.\n[Shamail Baab fi Ibadah]\n\nNote: Hadhrat Umar [radhiyallahu anhu] relates that Rasulullah [salallahu\nalaihi wasallam] said, “Whoever was unable to complete his devotions at\nnight should complete it in the morning before noon. It will be regarded as\nthough he had completed it at night.” [Muslim]. One should not overlook it\nbecause of the time passing by, otherwise the nafs will become accustomed to\nomitting it.
