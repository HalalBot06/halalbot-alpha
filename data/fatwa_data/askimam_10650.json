  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have been trying to have a baby for 3 years. I have always had very irregular menses and also have polycystic ovaries syndrome. Could you please tell me a dua that could help me get pregnant.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe are certain that you must be already making du?aa to Allah Ta?ala for a child. Almighty Allah Ta?ala grants a child/ren to whosoever He wishes. His knowledge is absolute and He alone knows what is good for every creation.\n\nIt is the will of Allah that you do not have a baby. The wisdom of the will of Allah cannot be fully understood by us. As believers, we submit to His will and state ?Aamannaa? (we believe). He is hearing your du?aa and is fully aware of the desire of your heart. Continue making du?aa and submit your wish to the will of Allah. May Allah Ta?ala grant you whatever is best for you, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
