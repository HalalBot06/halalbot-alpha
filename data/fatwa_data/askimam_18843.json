  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI work for a non-muslim printing company for the past three years. I am a DTP Operator/Graphic Designer. I want to know if my rizq is halal be earning my salary from this company. The nature of the work I do is adverts, competitions and promotions for alchohol,movies and music. However not all of my jobs include these items but atleast 2-4 times a week I will have a job like this. Some doubts and uncertainty has lingered in me with the dissatisfaction of doing these kind of jobs and thought about resigning. Please provide me with an answer so that I can make my decision. I want to make a decision based on taqwa and not any rash decisions.\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIt will be makrooh tahrīmī (close to harām) for you to work for this company due to directly assisting towards sin.\n\n(Fatāwa Shāmi, Vol. 4, Pg. 268) [1]\n\n \n\nHelp one another in righteousness and piety, but help not one another in sin and animosity\n\n \n\n                                                                                                                                                   (Al Māidah,2)[2]\n\nTherefore, it is highly advisable to either request the management not to assign you any such tasks which are contrary to shari’a or to seek alternative employment elsewhere.\n\n \n\n If they excuse to assign you such tasks, you may continue to work at the company while in the process of finding another job if you have no other means of income. Consequently, tawbah and istighfār must be made.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWhoever fears Allāh - Allāh will create for him a way of deliverance. And will provide him sustenance from a place he had never expected; and whoever relies on Allāh – then Allāh is Sufficient for him; indeed Allāh will accomplish His command; indeed Allāh has set a proper measure for all things.\n\n \n\n(Surah Talāq, 2,3) [3]\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl.
