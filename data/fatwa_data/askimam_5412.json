  "question": "Please let me know how many minutes prior to Fajar, Tahajud time exists",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. I Would like to pray Tahajud ki Namaz just before Fajar Ki Namaz. So please let me know how many minutes prior to Fajar, Tahajud time exists. 2. On the way if we see graveyards & Dargah, what should we pray ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Fajr time commences at true dawn. This is when a streak of whiteness\nappears on the eastern horizon. The moment Fajr time commences, Tahajjud\ntime terminates. One may read Tahajjud at any time before the commencement\nof Fajr time. It is best to perform the Tahajjud at the latter part of the\nnight. You will have to consult your local Ulama or Musjid to determine the\ntimes of Fajr, etc.\n2. When passing a graveyard or grave, you may say salaam unto the\ninhabitants by reciting Masnoon Du'aas. You may also pray for their\nforgiveness and recite something for their Isaal-e-Sawaab.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
