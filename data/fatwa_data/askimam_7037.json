  "question": "no.4979.Are the remedies, which are mentioned in the above book, based on the experience of Maulana Ashraf Saheb, or do they have daleel to back them up from Qur'an and Ahadith",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSir, i have read your standard reply on the book \"Remedies from the Holy Qur'an\". I have a few straight forward questions, which i hope you answer. Q1 : Are the remedies, which are mentioned in the above book, based on the experience of Maulana Ashraf Saheb, or do they have daleel to back them up from the Qur'an and Ahadith? Q2: If a person does not believe in the above book, is he a kaafir or a sinner or is he safe? Q3 : Shaykh Munajjid, of islam-qa, says that if something has no daleel for it, from the Shariah, and we say that do that thing, a certain number of times, at so and so time, then that is bid'ah. Do you agree with this view? Q4 : My mother was reciting from the book, \"Remedies from the Holy Qur'an\". She was reciting a certain ayah, after Fajr, 21 times, saying that it will improve my eyesight. I said that this is bid'ah, as it has no daleel for it from the Shariah. I believe that the Qur'an is a cure for mankind. However, the practise of reciting an ayah a certain number of times, at a fixed time, when there is no daleel for doing so, is bid'ah, as per Shaykh Munajjid's fatwa and my understanding of that fatwa. However, since that day, i've been feeling nervous. My question is, did i commit kufr, or am i sinful or am i guilty of no crime? . Plz do reply to all 4 of my questions, individually.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, I wish to explain that the author of the book was no simple person. he is known as Mujaddid Millah (reviver of Deen) of our century.\n\nTheir connection and link with Allah cannot be fathomed. Therefore, the book although it is based on experience, the effect is enormous. Although one who rejects this experiences is not a Kaafir, but one should abstain from doing so.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
