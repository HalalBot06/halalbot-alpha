  "question": "Assalam-alaikum. I would like to know if in the afterlife we will be reunited with our families from this life, if so, how does this occur.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy grandmother passed away a couple of years ago. I miss her dearly. Due to my husbands job situation, we now live where she use to live, and am reminded of her constantly. How can I overcome this? If Allah has intended such reunions, then how does this come about.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is our belief as Muslims that our final abode will be Jannah. That is\nwhere we will meet our Muslim relatives, Insha Allah.\n\nIt is natural for one to think of their beloved and near ones after their\ndeath. That is an ideal opportunity to make Isaal-e-Sawaab (send Sawaab) to\nthem by doing some act of virtue, for example, giving charity, etc. on their\nbehalf. The deceased receive the reward on behalf of their living relatives\nand get happy.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
