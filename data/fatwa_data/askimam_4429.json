  "question": "If u are a female working for a company that stays open during jumua, is the money u earn haraam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI work for a store in a shopping centre and even though some stores with Muslim managers close for Jumua my boss has instructed me to remain open. There are only females in the store.Is the money he pays me haraam? If i didnt work during jumua time would the money i earn from him still be haraam?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFor a muslim to keep his business open during the time of Jummah is\nprohibited as Allah says in the Quraan \" Hasten to the remembrance of Allah\nand leave off Business.\" Allah also states \" ... That which Allah has is\nbetter than any past time or bargain and Allah is the best provider .\"\n\nFrom the above you can deduce that this time it is prohibited to do\nbusiness. If you are working for a non Muslim, then you should take your\nlunch break at the time of Jummah, in that way making your earning Halaal.\nAnd if you are working for Muslim, you should advise him accordingly and if\nhe does not heed your advice then you should take your break at the time of\nJummah, thus, validating you earnings.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nShaykh Irshaad Amod\nfor: FATWA DEPT."
