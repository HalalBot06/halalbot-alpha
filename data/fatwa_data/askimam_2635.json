  "question": "I will be taking a flight overseas (Canada to Pakistan) and I want to know how to perform my Salaat.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThere will be a few stop-overs, but the flight will be 16 hours in total.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf any Salaat time approaches during the flying time, that Salaat should be performed on the plane. You should inform the flight attendants of your religious obligation and request them to facilitate for you by arranging an isolated corner to perform your Salaat. In our experiences of traveling by plane, we have observed that flight attendants of all flights are very accommodating. However, due to their responsibilities, we should co-operate with them as well.\n\nYou should calculate the Salaat times during your travel and every Salaat should be performed timeously. If there will be stop-overs and if the passengers are not required to be on board the plane, then you should perform the Salaat of that time in the transit lounge of the airport.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
