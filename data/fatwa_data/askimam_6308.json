A sound marriage is\nbased on good communication between the spouses. When he is in a good mood\nfor talking, broach this subject in a very affectionate and polite manner\nand explain what your predicament is. Insha Allah, better communication will\nlead to better understanding of each other.\n\nAlso, perform 2 Rakaat Salaatul-Haajat and beg Allah Ta'ala to assist you.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
