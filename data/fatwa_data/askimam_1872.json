  "question": "I'm married and have a poor relationship in bed with my wife.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy society frowns at men who have more than one wife.I fear Zina.Is it permissible for me to take another woman as my life partner without my present wife's knowledge or the knowledge of others and carry on life with both women.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari'ah, it is permissible for a male to have a maximum of\nfour wives simultaneously, on condition that he maintains justice and\nfulfils the rights of each wife. In view of the complexities and\ndifficulties of a polygamous marriage, you should exercise caution in\nentering into such a marriage. Often people enter into a second marriage to\novercome one difficulty, but are then faced with the greater difficulties of\na polygamous marriage, thus defeating the actual purpose of marriage. We\nadvise you discuss your present difficulty with your wife with wisdom.\nExplaining to her your intention of taking a second wife will save you from\nthe negative consequences of her discovering your secret second marriage.\n\nNonetheless, should you remarry without the knowledge of your first wife,\nthe marriage will be valid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
