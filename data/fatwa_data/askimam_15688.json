  "question": "The concept of Wasaila..Intercession and meaning for this duaa",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThe concept of Wasaila, i know the Prophet (saw) is going to intercede for us on the Day of Judgement, but the barwelis say we ask the prophet (saw) in our duas to intercede for us now, as i understand the prophet (saw) is dead but alive in his grave, can you give a clear answer on this matter.\n\nI  was talking to a brother about my trip to turkey and while i was doing that i uttered the word \"crap\" by mistake.  I was going to see the holy trusts e,g the prophets (saw) and sahabah (ra) swords etc, but due to it being closed as it is only open in holy month of ramadhan, i was meant to say i saw the ottomans crap but i accidently used it while saing it when mentioning the holy trusts, i have prayed for forgiveness i feel so bad, i hope Allah (swt) will forgive me?\n\nCan you tell me the meaning for, :\n\nAllahumma suri al islam wal Muslimeen & i can't really spell it but it goes along the lines of :\n\nWa sallallah hutallah hali halki hi muhammad walli hi wa asahabi ajmayeen braham takiya wal humrahmeen\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThere are two issues:\n\nIntercession and  Waseela \n\nIntercession of Rasulullah(صلى الله عليه وسلم) will be on the day of judgement.\n\nWaseela is a means. One may make Dua to Allah through the close relationship between Allah and Rasulullah(صلى الله عليه وسلم).\n\nYou did not state the actual statement and in which context you said the statement. What was \"crap\" you were referring to?\n\nThe meaning of  \"Allahumman suril Islama Wal Muslimeen\" is \"Oh Allah, Help Islam and Muslims\"\n\nWa Salallahu Ta'ala Ala Khayri Khalqihi Muhammadin Wa `Ala Aalihi Washabihi Ajma'een, Bi Rahmatika Ya Arhamar Rahimeen.\n\nAnd Salutations of Allah Ta'ala be upon the best of His creations, Muhammad and Upon his companions all together.. With your mercy O The Most Merciful of those who show mercy.\n\n\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
