  "question": "I have heard that apes have arisen because of a cursed people. Is this true?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaams. I have read or heard something that humans were transformed into apes because they were cursed. What is the significance of this and does this explain why apes are 98% similar to human beings in their biochemical structure. and what is the significance of this in the Quraan? \"When they were too arrogant to [desist from] what they had been forbidden, We said to them, 'Be you apes, humiliated'\" (Qur'an 7:166).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSinful people in the past were transformed into apes and swines. However, that belief that that punishment is the inception of all apes and swines is correct. And Allah Ta`ala Knows Best Was salaam Mufti Ebrahim Desai FATWA DEPT."
