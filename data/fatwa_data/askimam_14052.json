  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat Quran & Hadith (Salallahoalihawasallam ) said about TERA TEZI is it a true concept that !3th of Safar brings difficulties to men?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nSafar is one of the \"Al-Ashur al hurum\" the four sanctified months in which battle was prohibited in the days of the Holy Prophet Sallallahu alayhi wassallam.\n\nSome people believe that this month is an unlucky month; therefore, they avoid holding marriage ceremonies or any other happy gatherings in this month. . To refrain from any act, marriage, journey, etc. in some months, Muharram, Safar, etc. was a custom of the pre-Islamic era (in Arabia during Jahiliyyah) based on suspicion. This belief is totally baseless. Rasulullah Sallallahu alayhi wasallam eradicated all such misconceptions and superstitious beliefs and stated, \"Laa Safar\"- ([To hold] the month of Safar [as unlucky] is nothing.)\n\nHadhrat Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam! ) said, \"There is no bad omen.\" (Mishkat pg.391) In another narration, it is recorded, \"There is no (bad omen) in (the month of) Safar\".\n\nTherefore, Muslims should not give in to such superstitions. There is no restriction on marrying in any part of the year and neither does any part of the year itself have any negative consequences. As Muslims, our belief is all good and bad is from Allah. He knows the destiny of all. Bad omens are thus prohibited.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
