  "question": "Can I force my parents to allow me to marry someone I like because its my right of selection or should I just obey to what they have selected",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalam alikum, I am 23 years old man and my parents want me to get married with someone they have selected for me. The problem is that I like my cousin and want to marry her, she is Hafiz Quran and Hadees, she is a very pious girl, observes hijab and very conservative. My parents don?t agree to this for a few reasons, first because her elder brother is married to my elder sister, so they are afraid that any future fights in my married life may affect my sisters life, second reason is that my cousin remains sick very often, and so my parents don?t agree. I had asked a Muftee to make Istekhara whether I should marry her or not, and he said that the results look good. I have also found from my elder sister that my cousin also likes me very much. We have just met once when we were about the age of 16. My question is can I force my parents (politely and respectfully) although they are strongly opposing to this marriage, because its my right of selection or should I just obey to what they have selected for me. I feel very depressed to break the heart of either that girl and my parents.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe commend you for looking at Deen when seeking qualities of a wife-to-be. you are looking at Deen.
