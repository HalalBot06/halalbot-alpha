  "question": "Please inform whether it is permissible for a woman to assist his husband in business",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan a woman assist her husband in his business. I have heard that one of the signs of qayamah is that women will be participating in business with their husbands. Does it holds some weight in shariah or it is mere superstition?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe original place of a woman is at home. Only at the time of extreme necessity she may emerge from her home and that being totally according to the dictates of Shari?ah and restricted to the amount of necessity.\n\nA woman may assist her husband in business in many ways other than emerging from her home, she could be at home possibly doing the paperwork, etc. or she could even be a sleeping partner in the business.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
