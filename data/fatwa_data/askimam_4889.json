A%0D%0Aperson should exercise extreme precaution in matters related to this. In the%0D%0AHadith, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has warned us, 'Stay away from%0D%0Aurine because generally the Adhaan of Qabr is attained through it.'%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala praises the people of Qubaa thus, 'In it are men who love to%0D%0Aclean and to purify themselves, and Allah loves those who make themselves%0D%0Aclean and pure (i.e. who clean their private parts with dust (which has%0D%0Aproperties of soap) and water from urine and stool after answering the call%0D%0Aof nature).'%0D%0A%0D%0AAccording to an Aayat, when this Aayat was revealed, Nabi (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) sent for Umaym ibn Saa'ida and asked him what is the%0D%0Apurification Allah has praised you for. He replied, 'O Rasul of Allah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), no man or woman comes out from relieving%0D%0Ahimself%2Fherself except that he washes his private parts.' Nabi (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) said, This is it.' (Ibn Kathir vol.2 pg.397; Qadeemi)%0D%0A%0D%0AIf the university toilets have water, then you should cleanse yourself with%0D%0Athe water. If there is no water, you should make arrangements for water by%0D%0Akeeping a container there. The water on the toilet seats may be wiped with%0D%0Atissue paper before using the toilet. If any impurities touched the private%0D%0Aparts, that may be washed during Istinjaa, hence, there is no need to remove%0D%0Athe lower genital hairs."
