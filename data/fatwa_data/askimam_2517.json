Allah has prescribed severe punishment for Zina.\n\nAs you stated you have made thauba may Allah accept your duas? Keep in mind\nthat thauba also means not returning to that sin again. As for marring the\ngirl this is a very great step in your life. You should firstly make\nIstikhara as well as make Mashwara (consult) with your seniors and then\ndecide.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
