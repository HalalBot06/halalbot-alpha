  "question": "How can I explain to a non-muslim why a Muslim women must cover her hair?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI actually want this person to understand the logic of Islam and at the same time become more and more curious towards Islam. I also want this person to understand the status that Islam gives women because nowadays western beliefs has strayed the human mind into thinking that Islam restricts women too much. Please help me on this matter as I would like to draw people toward Islam rather than away. Shukran Wassalaam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for submitting your question to the institute.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is commendable that you are keen to invite non-Muslims to Islam. Alhamdulillah, we have been granted Imaan and are from amongst the 'best of nations'. It is incumbent upon us to invite others to deen and to make effort on our families and on fellow Muslims too. Please do try to instill the concept of hijab upon your friends and family members too. Modesty is the greatest protection against the temptations of shaitaan and the dangers of fornication and adultery. We are reminded in the Holy Quran that we should 'come not near' towards these 'dangers'. Our modest dressing is the first line in defence against falling into these traps shaitaan throws in our path.%0D%0A%0D%0AI am enclosing three interesting articles which encapsulate the virtues of 'covering up'. I have dealt with the position and status of women in Islam in another article on the website, so please do check it out on our ?Social Department? page.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala grant Imaan to millions of non-Muslims all over the world and may He guide all of us to the straight path and towards obeying His commandments to earn His pleasure. Ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0ASister Fadila%0D%0ASOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
