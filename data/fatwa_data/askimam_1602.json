  "question": "My question is can you kill a disbeliever who doesn't accept Islam. Please tell me in details with simple English understanding.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible to kill a disbeliever if he does not accept Islam. However, in a situation of jihad, if the disbelievers are conquered, they will be invited to Islam. If they refuse to accept Islam, they will be ordered to give jizya (tax). If they refuse to give jizya, then only will they be killed.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti E Desai\nFatwa Dept."
