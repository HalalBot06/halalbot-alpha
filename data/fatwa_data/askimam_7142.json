  "question": "Will the wearing of lipstick break the fast?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWill the wearing of lipstick or any other type of make up break the fast. Please specify which types of make up\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nLipstick and make up do not break the fast. However, you should consider two issues:\na) Many of these products contain Haraam and impure ingredients. In such a case, it will not be permissible to use such a make up.\nb) Many of such products prevent water from reaching the skin. In such a case the Wudhu or Ghusl performed with such make up on will not be valid.\n\nNevertheless, the fast is not broken.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT"
