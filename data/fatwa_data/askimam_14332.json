The Qur’aan is recited exactly as it was revealed. The I’eraab and words will often differ amongst the different Qiraat, but in such a way that the 2 meanings do not contradict each other.\n\n2. Yes, there were differences in the copipes of the Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhu] like the copy of Ali [radhiallaahu anhu], ibn Mas’ood [radhiallaahu anhu], Aaisha [radhiallaahu anhu], etc. but in the Khilaafat of Uthmaan [radhiallaahu anhu] the entire Ummah was unanimous upon the compilation done by Uthmaan [radhiallaahu anhu].\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nQari Ismail Abdul Aziz\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)\n\nTHE QUR'AAN WAS REVEALED IN SEVEN DIALECTS\n\nAllah Ta’ala has created man so that man may worship Him. He sent the Ambiyaa (Alayhimus salaam) to teach man the correct method of worshipping and had also given Saheefas (scriptures) to many Ambiyaa (Alayhimus salaam). For example, He had given the Zaboor to Dawood (Alayhis salaam), the Tawraat to Moosa (Alayhis salaam) and the Injeel to Isa (Alayhis salaam). In the same manner, Allah revealed to our beloved Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) the Qur’aan Kareem.\n\nIn the past, the prophets and their books were sent to certain nations or communities for a specific period of time, whereas Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the Qur’aan were sent for the entire world uptill the day of Qiyaamat.\n\nOur Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was sent as a mercy to the entire mankind. It is for this reason that we find that he had always had the concern that his Ummah should experience no difficulty.\n\nHadhrat Ubayy Ibn Ka’ab (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that once Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) met Jibraaeel (Alayhis salaam) and said to him, ‘O Jibraeel (Alayhis salaam)! I have been sent to an Ummat who are unable to read or write. Amongst them are those who are weak, those who are old, those who are slaves and those who have never read a book in their lives.’ Hadhrat Jibraaeel (Alayhis salaam) mentioned, ‘O Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)! Certainly this Qur’aan has been revealed in 7 different dialects.’ (Tirmidhi)\n\nIn another Hadith narrated by Ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhu), it is said that Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has mentioned, ‘Jibraaeel (Alayhis salaam) has taught me to recite the Qur’aan in one dialect. I turned to him and continued asking him to increase it, and he continued increasing it until it reached seven dialects.’\n\nIn another narration by Ubayy ibn Ka’ab (Radhiallaahu Anhu), it is stated that once Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was in one of the fields of the Bani Ghiffaar (Adhaat) and Jibraaeel (Alayhis salaam) had come to him and said, ‘Allah commands you to teach your Ummat to recite the Qur’aan in one dialect.’ Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ‘I ask Allah for his pardon and forgiveness, most certainly my Ummah does not have the ability to do that.’ Jibraaeel (Alayhis salaam) came to him for the second time and said, ‘Allah commands you to teach your Ummat to recite the Qur’aan in two dialects.’\n\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said for the second time, ‘I ask Allah for his pardon and forgiveness. Most certainly my Ummat does not have the ability to do this.’ Then Jibraaeel (Alayhis salaam) came to him for the third time and said:\n\n‘Allah commands you to teach your Ummat to recite the Qur’aan in three dialects.’ Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) gave the same answer: ‘I ask Allah for his pardon and forgiveness, most certainly my Ummah does not have the ability to do this.’ Then Jibraaeel (Alayhis salaam) came to him for the fourth time and said, ‘Alla Ta’ala commands you to teach your Ummah to recite the Qur’aan in seven dialects, and whichever one they recite, they will be correct.’ (Muslim)\n\nIn another Hadith, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that once I heard Hishaam ibn Hakeem ibn Hizaam (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reciting Suratul Furqaan in the lifetime of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). While listening to his Qiraat, he was reciting in different letters which Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) did not recite to me. I was close to pouncing upon him, but I controlled myself until he made Salaam. Then I wrapped my sheet around him and said to him, ‘Who has taught you to read this Surah the way I have heard you reciting it?’ he replied, ‘Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has taught me to read this Surah.’\n\nI then said to him, ‘Certainly Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has taught it to me in a manner other than which you have recited.’ Then I pulled him and took him to Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and said, ‘O Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) he is reciting Suratul Furqaan in a manner other than which you have taught to me.’ Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) then said, ‘Read, O Hishaam.’ He then recited the same Qiraat which I had heard him reciting. Upon this Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ‘In the same manner it was revealed.’ Then Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ‘Read O Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu).’ I then recited the way he had taught it to me. Upon this, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), ‘In the same way it was revealed. Certainly, the Qur’aan has been revealed in seven dialects. Read whichever one is easier for you.’ (Bukhari and Muslim).\n\nFrom all these narrations, it is clear that the Qur’aan was revealed in more than one way of recitation.\n\nMeaning of Seven Dialects\n\nThe Ulama have approximately forty opinions on the meaning of seven dialects. Two opinions are the most accepted:\n\nImaam Abul Fadhl al-Razee (RA) mentions that if we have to look at all the changes and narrations of Qiraat, we will find that they have one of the changes which are mentioned below:\n\n1.  The changing of the noun concerning whether it should be singular, dual or plural. For example, ‘ta’aam miskeen’ which is singular is changed into plural ‘ta’aam masaakeen’ or the changing of the noun from masculine into feminine or vice versa, e.g. the changing of ‘laa yuqbal minhaa shafaa’at’ which is masculine to ‘laa tuqbal minhaa shafaa’at’ which is feminine.\n\n2.  The changes that take place in the Harkat (symbols – fatha, dhamma, kasra), e.g. ‘kalimaatin’ to ‘kalimaatun’\n\n3.  The changing by adding and subtracting letters, e.g. ‘saari’oo’ to ‘wa saari’oo’\n\n4.  The changing of the sequence of the words, e.g. ‘wa qaataloo wa qutiloo’ to ‘wa qutiloo wa qaataloo’\n\n5.  The changing of the tense of verbs from the past tense into future or present tense or command, e.g. ‘tatawwa’a khayran’ to ‘yatawwaa khayran’ and ‘qaala rabbiy’ to ‘qul rabbiy’\n\n6.  The changing of one word into another, e.g. ‘wa tawakkal’ to ‘fatawakkal'\n\n7.  The changing of the pronunciation and accent, e.g. full mouth into empty mouth, etc.\n\nImaam Abul Fadhl Razi (RA) mentions that the 7 different dialects encompass the above 7 changes.\n\nAllaamah Jazri (RA) mentions that he pondered over the Hadith of seven dialects for more than 30 years, until Allah Ta’ala had opened one meaning to him. After pondering over all the Qiraat, he found that the changes that took place were the changes which are mentioned below:\n\n1.  The changing of the symbol of a word, though the meaning and feature of the word does not change, e.g. ‘yahsabu’ to ‘yahsibu’\n\n2.  The changing of the symbol and meaning, but the feature does not change, e.g. ‘fatalaqqaa aadamu min rabbihii kalimaatin’ to ‘fatalaqqaa aadama min rabbihii kalimaatun’\n\n3.  The changing of the letters and the meaning, but the feature does not change, e.g. ‘as-swiraat’ to ‘as-siraat’\n\n4.  The changing of the letters and the meaning, but the feature does not change, e.g. ‘tubluw’ to ‘tatluw’ or ‘nunajjiyka’ to ‘nunjiyka’\n\n5.  The changing of the letter, the feature and the meaning, e.g. ‘ya-atali’ to ‘yata-alli’\n\n6.  The changing of the sequence of words, e.g. ‘fayaqtuloona wa yuqtaloona’ to ‘wayaqutuloona fayaquloona’\n\n7.  The adding and subtracting of letter, e.g. ‘Wa awsaw’ to ‘wawassay’\n\nThe changes of the pronunciation and accent can be included in the changing of words mentioned above.\n\nThe meaning of 7 dialects is clear from these 2 opinions.\n\nQari Ismail Abdul-Aziz\nHead and Senior Ustaadh: Department of Qiraat – Madrasah In’aamiyyah\nAn Expert in the field of Qiraat (7 Dialects and 10 Dialects) – lecturing both at the Madrasah"
