  "question": "Having ghsul in a bath tub to wash the entire body three times using the same water. If this is permissable or not?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI know that if one is in major impurity (hadasa akbar) then it is fard for him to take Ghusl (bath). I know that the fard's of ghusl are 1)to wash the mouth, 2)wash the nose and wash the entire body including the hair. If any part of the body remains dry then one will remain impure and not purified. Regarding this issue, when after I have had sexual intercourse, I take a bath but I take very long to take a bath (more then an 1hr) because I am unsatisfied or afraid that water has not reached all the limbs. So I repeatedly wash and take a long time. This causes a lot of trouble with my house hold members who wish to use the bath or toilet, and this is not good. Q1 I would like to know if I wash my mouth and nose and my hair and then after fill the bath tub with water and then dip or lie down in the bath, will this suffice the obligation of washing the entire body, as water will reach all parts of the body. Q2 Will it be permissible to wash with the same water in the bath tub my whole body and clean it three times. Q3 If I rub by body to remove the dirt from it can I use the same water in the bath tub to clean my self or do I have to fill the bath tub again. Q4) Will the water be pure and permissible to use or is not permissible (my ghusl will be invalid)? Note- when I take a bath I use a cup (filled with water) to wash my entire body, it is this process that takes me a long time to take a bath and I do not have a shower.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMadina 1420 years ago was very sparsely populated, a desert area with not%0D%0Amuch water available.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe best of creation, our Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) lived in this%0D%0Atown. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to use the water that was%0D%0Aavailable and with this have a complete Fardh bath. It has been estimated%0D%0Athat Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to use approximately 3 litres%0D%0Aof water for a bath. The method of our Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)'s%0D%0Abath was such that first he used to wash both hands to the wrist with the%0D%0Aintention of Ghusl. Thereafter, he used to wash both the private parts,%0D%0Acleaning all Najaasats. Wudhu should then follow this process. Thereafter,%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to pour water over his head thrice,%0D%0Afollowed by water being poured 3 times on the right side and then the left%0D%0Aside of the body.%0D%0A%0D%0ABy rubbing the body, while pouring water on the body every hair and every%0D%0Apart of the body would become wet with water.%0D%0A%0D%0AA tub (in general) is not 10 hand spans by 10 hand spans in area (regarded%0D%0Aas little water which becomes impure by impurity falling in it). Thus, water%0D%0Awould become impure if some impure substance enters that amount of water.%0D%0AHence, soaking in the tub would not render one pure. As regards the doubts%0D%0Aone experiences, it is just the evil whisper of Shaytaan. Read, 'A'oodhu%0D%0Abillah' 3 times before undressing and follow the Sunnat method of pouring%0D%0Awater and rubbing ensuring to cover every part of the body. If any doubt%0D%0Aoccurs thereafter, then disregard them. (Fataawa Mahmood vol.9 pg.46)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
