  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like to know that does a women have to go on haj with a mahram? I would like to go on haj but what if no mahram wants to go with me, can I then go alone with my mother or another older woman? My father doesn't want to go neither my brother. But my mother and I want to go very much. I am 29 yrs old not married as yet. My father says first marriage then haj. But the reason I haven't been married is because first, its Allah's will and we haven't been able to find anyone suitable. I am not refusing to marry but I don't understan why we can't go on haj and at the same time keep looking for someone. Is it necessary to be married first?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is only Fardh upon a woman to fulfil Hajj if she has sufficient wealth and a husband or any other Mahram relative to accompany her. if she does not have any Mahram relative to accompany her then it is not permissible for her to go for Hajj.\n\nEven if uptil her death no Mahram is available, she cannot go for Hajj, rather it becomes Fardh upon her to make Wasiyyat of a Hajj-e-Badal. (Ahsanul Fataawa part4 pg.532)\n\nTherefore, continuously encourage your brother/father or any other Mahram to accompany you and make abundant Du?aa to Allah Ta?ala that he opens up the wayf for you and that he grants you the ability to fulfil this pillar of Deen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
