  "question": "My wife secretly went to the hospital and received an injection for her not to conceive. When I discovered this I divorced her. Did I act according to the Shariah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDivorce is most disliked by Allah. You should not have divorced her. Instead, you should exhaust the methods of reformation prescribed in the Qur?aan by advising her, then separating beds and then lightly beating her. If she still disobeys, then only you should consider divorce.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best.\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
