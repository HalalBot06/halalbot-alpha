  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIn our Mosque normally Imam saheb in Zoher pray start jamat  without performing 4 rakat sunnat.  . According to Shariat is it ok or not?\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe four rakats before zohar salah is sunnate-muakkadah. It is a sin to leave out those sunnats. It is advisable for one to perform his sunnats at home. It is possible the Imam of your musjid is practicing on sunnah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
