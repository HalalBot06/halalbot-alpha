  "question": "We have kept fast on the Tuesday even though most people have started fasting on wednesday as our fellow muslim brother keep fast with Saudi,",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWe have kept fast on the Tuesday even though most people have started fasting on wednesday as our fellow muslim brother keep fast with Saudi, however we intend having eid with our friends in another town. There is a possbility we may fast 31 days is this permissible cause we do believe in sighting moon but because the community were fasting so did we?\n\nSecondly we have no Imaam so we read 8 Rakats Taraweeh is this permisible or should i go home & complete the other 12 rakats\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1) If the moon was not sighted before Tuesday, the fast on Tuesday will not be the fast of Ramadhan. Thus, there will not be an issue of 31 fasts of Ramadhan.\n\n2) It is necessary to perform 20 rakats of Tarawih. It is compulsory for you to make up the remaining twelve rakats.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
