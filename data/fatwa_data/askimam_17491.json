  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. what does Islam say about music (i.e. nasheeds with music, love songs etc)\n2. To what extent should a women cover up in Islam (i.e. niqab, jilbab etc)\n3. Is accountancy Haram in Islam\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n Assalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\n1)      The question regarding music has already been answered, please refer to these links:\nWhat is the Islamic stand on music?\n'Islamic' Songs with music sounds... what is the rule?\nA caution for our companions on the prohibition of music\nA brief response to proofs which apparently sanction the listening of music\n\n \n\n2)      The question on women veiling themselves has already been answered, please refer to this link:\nhttp://www.askimam.org/fatwa/fatwa.php?askid=0fa3005a27b626c083c2467d3ef35484\n\n \n\n3)      It is stated in a Hadeeth   \n\nلعن رسول الله –صلى الله عليه وسلم- آكل الربا وموكله وكاتبه وشاهديه وقال هم سواء.\n\nRasulullah (salallahu alaihi wasallam) has cursed the person who consumes interest, feeds it to others, he who records it and he who is a witness to this interest bearing transaction, and he (salallahu alaihi wasallam) said: they are all equal (in the sin).\n\n(Sahih Muslim vol.2 pg27, Rashidiyya)\n\nIf a person deals in interest, the warning of the Hadeeth will apply directly to him. It will not apply to the accountant because he does not provide any help to the transaction itself. He only records the facts as they occurred or checks the correctness of their recording.  (Contemporary fatawa, pg.161,Idara-e-Islamiat).\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa\n\nImportant Posts and Links\n\n \n\nShar'ii stance on Shares and Stocks|Have you prepared your WILL??|Moonsighting - Its that time to sight the moon"
