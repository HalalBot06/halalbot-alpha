  "question": "I work in the IT Department of an MNC Bank in Singapore. Can I work in the IT dept. Let me know please.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Mufti Sahab, My question is same as above. Can I work for an IT department in a bank. IT- Information Technology. Also kindly clarify regarding Question 7810 you had mentioned that muslims can work in south african banks.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is a difference between the case mentioned in q7810 and your situation.\n\nThe difference is that one situation is when you have already worked in a bank and received salary, and the second is to seek employment in a bank. To work in a bank is not permissible, because you are aiding in Haraam, but in order to save the salary of a Muslim, we will assume that it has been paid from the Halaal portfolio of the bank. This does not mean that it is permissible to work in a bank. thus, it will not be permissible to work in the IT department of the bank.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
