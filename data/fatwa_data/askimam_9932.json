  "question": "1.Why do some people read Nafl sitting down? Is this allowed? What is the story behind it?2.Who exactly are JuJ Majoj going to be?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is permissible to read Nafl (optional) Salaat sitting down even though you have ability to stand. However, only half the reward will be received. This (sitting in Nafl with the ability to stand) is only allowed in order that extra prayers not be neglected out of laziness or tiredness. It is only allowed if the person has the strength to stand.\n\n2. Yajuj and Majuj already exist. They have been imprisoned behind a wall built by Dhul-Qarnayn thousands of years ago. They will break down this wall close to Qiyaamat and they will spread lot of Fitnah in the world. Thereafter, Allah Ta?ala will destroy them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
