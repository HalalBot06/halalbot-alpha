  "question": "I was wondering how one knows if one's prayer has been answered by Allah.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSpecifically, how can you tell for sure if what you think to be an answer from Allah is really an answer and not merely a misinterpretation on your part?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Every prayer (Du?aa) is answered by Allah Ta?ala. This divine response by Allah does not necessarily mean that a person?s request will be carried out to the letter. Sometimes a persons wishes are fulfilled. Sometimes the reward is postponed for the hereafter and sometimes Allah Ta?ala staves off calamity in response to a Du?aa. So, in short, there are a number of methods of ?acceptance of Du?aas?.\n\n2. In the case of Istikhaara ? where a person seeks the counsel of Allah ? the inclination of the heart is a form of divine guidance in the matter concerned.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
