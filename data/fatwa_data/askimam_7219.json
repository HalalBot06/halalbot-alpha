  "question": "My husband married his first cousin in 2001 so she could come over here. His family said this was the only way we could marry.Where do we stand Islamically? What advice can you give us?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen my husband was 14 he was engaged to his first cousin in Pakistan. We met at 16 (1997) and pursued a relationship. I knew of his situation but he assured me that he would break the engagement off. His parents told him that if he married this girl and brought her over to the UK he would be allowed marry me with their blessing. In 2001 with my blessing on this understanding he went to Pakistan and did the Nikah. The marriage was never consummated and he returned 2 days later and he has not spoken to her since, he does not support her financially. She knew about us from the beginning & said she was fine with it and that she just wanted to come to the UK. I was to wait until she came over here before we could marry. In May 2002 I found out I was pregnant, as a result we prayed our Nikah. She is due to come over soon and I am worried, where do stand we Islamically? How would he obtain a divorce? I cannot believe that this girl wants to simply come here to take care of my husbands mum her whole life. I feel like my marriage is a lie, his extended family do not know about me and our marriage & pregnancy is hidden. I prayed Istikarrah when we were married and I had a good notion. I love my husband and trust him completely but I don't trust his family. My family are unaware of this whole situation. What can you advise us to do? Zazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shariah, your husband?s marriage to his cousin is valid. She is also his wife.\n\nIf your husband fulfills your rights then you should accept him having the second wife. If he wishes to divorce her, that is his choice. You should not suggest that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
