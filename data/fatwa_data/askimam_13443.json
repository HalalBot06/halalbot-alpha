  "question": "How can we protect ourselves from jadoo? How can I put my faith back in the God who allows this to happen?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\ni & my family hv been victims of black magic, we know the distress that this cause. My son (1 years old was not spared either). Which brings to this question, \"Why does God allows this?\" What crime has my son committed that he has to suffer, what wrongs did my mum & myself did that we have to endure such. If what you say that \"everything is predestined while we are in our mother's womb\" then am I to understand that God wants this to happen but I do know for a fact and confirmed that someone i know is doing this to us.\n \nHow can we protect ourselves ? How can I put my faith back in the God who allows this to happen? Where is the justice because I see that person going thru life with so much of good health and happiness and prosperity while my mother's energy is draining out day by day.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah Ta’ala himself explain to us in the Qur’aan that this world is a place if test and examination.\n\n \n\n \n\nWe are bound to go through trials and hardships Allah Ta’ala tests his slaves in different ways. Some are tested with poverty, others with excessive wealth. Some with comfort and luxury and others with hardship and distress. This is the system of Allah Ta’ala. Do not be deceived by Shaytaan that comfort, luxury and peace means success. Allah Ta’ala has kept complete success only in Deen. The condition that Allah Ta’ala has tested you and your family with is a test from Allah Ta’ala. You have to be steadfast. Do not look at those who are well off living in comfort and luxury. Think of those who are undergoing even worse situations. This of the homeless and starving people around the world.\n\n \n\n \n\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has taught us many Du’aas for protection, the most effective of which is the recitation of the 3 Quls before sleeping. Recite Surah Ikhlaas, Falaq and Naas once each, blow onto your palms and pass your hands over the entire body thereafter. Do this 3 times. Insha Allah, Allah Ta’ala will very soon cure you, Aameen.\n\n \n\n \n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
