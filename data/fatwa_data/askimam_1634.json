  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am an 18 year old. and have a strong desire to get married to a Good Muslim woman but I can't understand how to find one. My parents are not Muslim so they can't 'hook' me up. I seem to only attract kufar women (who I'm always trying to evade) and the \"Muslim\" women I do know (that I'm trying to escape) are just Muslim by name and not action. How can I find and get to know a good Muslim female? Also I'm away from the community in Panama City, FL (sin city) and though I meet the criteria for getting married (in terms of potential sin). (and I'm ashamed to say it) I am a Diver in the U.S. Navy so what good Muslim woman would want me. What should I do? I've tried fasting, but unfortunately that's actually dangerous with my intense physical training. What should I do? Just suck it up and not get married ... but I fear that being around all this Zina I may be inclined towards these animals. I think a wife would strengthen the deen in my life? What should I do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nWe understand your plight and make Du?aa to Almighty Allah Ta?ala to grant you a suitable marriage partner.\n\nWe advise you recite 500 times Durood Shareef every day and male Du?aa to Allah Ta?ala for a marriage partner. You should also communicate with the Muslim community and search for a pious women in the community. You should not hasten. Generally, even in a large Muslim community, Muslim males do encounter much difficulty in finding a suitable marriage partner. We advise you be patient and exercise restraint while searching for a partner.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
