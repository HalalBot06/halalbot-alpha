  "question": "I would like to know if it's haram or not to pierce ones belly? Jazakallah Khaiun",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs long as the piercing does not mutilate the body and your intention is the\nbeautification for your husband then it can be considered as permissible.\nBut if your intention is to do as the young girls of the west are doing for\nthe sake of exposing their bodies so that all and sundry may view then this\nact is Haraam. As stated by Nabi (SAW) verily action is judged by their\nintentions.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
