  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn Islam, love, as is in the western culture, is prohibited. The negative\nconsequences of such love are abundantly clear. Among other evils, some are\nadultery, rape, abortion, etc.\n\nMany young girls have ruined their future by having a child and are\ncompelled to bring up the child as a singular parent. In many instances,\neven without the support of her 'lover'. If by 'love', inclination to marry\nis meant, then obviously, inclination and compatibility are necessary\nfactors to maintain a harmonious marriage.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
