  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam, is it shirk to believe that the Prophet (saw) is haazir wa naazir? Isn?t this the belief of Shah Waliyullah Dhelvi as well and mot just Berelvis? Also, how can it be shirk when they believe that the Prophet?s knowledge is acquired from Allah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHaazir (Omnipresent) and Naazir (Omniseeing) are the sole attributes of\nAllah.\n\nNo human being including our Nabiy (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) cannot be\nHaazir and Naazir. Our beloved Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is\nresting in Madinah Munawwarah. He informed us that when anyone sends Salaams\nto him, the angels convey the Salaam to him there.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
