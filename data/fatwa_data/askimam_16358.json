Even makrooh teherme.\n\n3- What are spefiic type of fish we are allow to eat, crabs,shrimp. Why. please provide with source( i have to fwd this).\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1. There are two types of makruh and the rulings of both differ.\n\nMakruh Tanzihi: A person will be rewarded for abstaining from a makruh tanzihi act but he will not be punished for committing this type of makruh.\nMakruh Tahreemi: A person will be rewarded for abstaining from a makruh tahreemi act but will be punished for committing this type of makruh.(Al-Madhhab al-Hanafiyya, vol 1, pg 304, Al-Rushd)\n\nIn fact, Makruh Tahreemi nears the boundry of haraam. Therefore, one should be extremely cautious regarding acts that are makruh.\n\n2. In principle, we as Hanafees are only permitted to eat fish from the sea. Animals and creatures of the sea besides fish are not permissible to eat.\n\nThere is a difference of opinion amongst the scholars regarding the permissibility of shrimps. Those that consider shrimps as fish say it is permissible and those that do not consider shrimps as fish say it is not permissible. Precaution demands that we abstain from consuming shrimps since there remains uncertainty in it being a fish. (Jaami’ Al-Fatawaa, vol 1, pg 376 / Kifaayat Al-Mufti, vol 9, pg 129 / Fatawaa Al-Mahmudiyya, vol 18, pg 216)\n\nIt is not be permissible to eat crabs since it is not classified as a fish.(Fatawaa Al-Mahmudiyya, vol 18, pg 267, Faruqiyya)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
