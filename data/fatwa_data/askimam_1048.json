  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy husband has been in prison for 10 years and I have remained faithful to him, but it is becoming almost unbearable to remain so.

If he\nrefuses to do so, you may contact your local Ulama and request them to annul\nyour marriage. They will apply the judicial procedure in doing so. Should\nthey require assistance to annul your marriage, they may contact us.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
