  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWill it not be Shirk or Haraam if I cast vote in favour of a political leader who does shirk by asking blessings from the \"Mazaar\" ?\n\nIt has been observed that many political leaders starts their political campaign from the \"Mazaar Shareef\" and asking blessing from the \"Pir Shaheb\". So far I know such act of these political leaders is Shirk. My question is, will it be Shirk or Haraam if I cast vote in favour of him in the election\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAlthough the political leader in question is guilty of Shirk, it will still be permissible to vote for him.\n\nYou are not voting in his favour because of his religious affiliation. You are voting for him because you regard him to be the most suitable to carry out the work entrusted to him.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
