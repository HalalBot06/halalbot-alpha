  "question": "Is it permissible for women to alter their monthly cycle using medications (e.g. birth control pills) so that by halting or shortening their haid they will be able to perform the Hajj or Umrah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nQuestion #1: In our community many women begin to take birth control pills two or three months before a planned hajj or umrah trip so that their haid will either be suppressed or greatly shortened at the time of their trip? This allows ease in planning the trip because once tickets are purchased and plans made these can no longer be changed or returned. Is this methodology permissible? If not are there other ways that a women can avoid such problems? Question #2: As a follow-up to the questions recently asked about musaafir and muqim. If someone lives in a college dormitory (has shifted most of his belongings there) and is sure that he will return to live in his parents home after completing his degree. When he returns to his parents home on the weekends (as a student) can he choose his college dorm to be his place of iqama and then shorten when traveling to his parents? Or will he pray shortened prayers the whole week and only complete his prayers when he visits his parents home? If he doesn?t know where he will live after graduating from college does he have the choice of choosing one (either his parents home or dorm room) as his place of watn asli? How often can one?s want asli be changed given that some people move to a new place every year?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ: A woman intends performing Hajj, her Haydh is calculated to occur during%0D%0Aand over the 5 days of Hajj.
