  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nyesterday I took my sehri performed fajar prayer and read quran in morning, and slept again. At 9 o clock when I woke up I saw it was spotting like my periods though my periods just over a week ago so I kept my roza for the whole day but spotting was continuous whole day. So is my roza still valid or do I need for qaza or will be I sinful as I continued my fasting? As I was in doubt ?\n\n \n\nIf somebody took medicines by which menstrual cycle disturbs and come before time so are these periods count as normal periods? During these periods can we perform namaz and roza in these periods\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\n1)     If you had your periods more than a week ago, this spotting will be Istihaaza. It will not be Haiz. Fasting during Istihaaza is valid.\n\n \n\n \n\n2)     The menstrual cycle that came before time due to taking medication will be treated as normal menses on condition that there is a 15 day separation from the last menstrual cycle and the present one.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
