  "question": "Is it haram to enlarge a tooth that Allah created small, or add a tooth that Allah never created? Also, is braces haram?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe tooth that I want to enlarge is an adult tooth, and the tooth I want to add never grew. I still have a baby tooth that I want to replace with a false tooth. By doing this I have to get braces, but the braces will also fix gaps and the like, which will make my teeth look perfect.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nImplanting of false teeth is permissible. Also, dental treatment to set right orthopaedic imperfections may be sought. The use of braces, etc. for this purpose is permissible.\n\nWhat we understand from ?enlarging the tooth? is that the small tooth will be ground down and a crown placed over it to bring in uniformity with the rest of the teeth. This is permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
