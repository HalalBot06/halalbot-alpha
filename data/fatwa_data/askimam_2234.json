  "answer": "QUESTION\nI ask this general question to avoid confusion in the future. I understand that part of the question is already answered, but it is fragmented. Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssets = Pension R10,000; Cash R15,000; Personal furniture not Zakaatable =\nR25,000\nLiabilities = House R36,000 per annum; Car R20,000 per annum (for example) =\nR56,000\n\nSince the liabilities exceeds the assets, there is no Zakaat on the assets.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
