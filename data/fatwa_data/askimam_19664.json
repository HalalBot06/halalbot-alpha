  "question": "Pearls of wisdom from our pious predecessors",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n Alhamdulillah, every night after Isha salah, Hazrat Mufti Ebrahim Desai sahib has initiated the practice of reading the malfoozaat of our pious predecessors for about 15 minutes.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n The people shouldn’t wait until after Jumuah Salah to bury the deceased\n\n A person once inquired “If a person dies after Fajr salah on Friday morning, should the people wait until after Jumuah salah to bury him or should they bury him before Jumuah salah?” Hazrat replied that the deceased should be buried immediately and the people should not delay.” The questioner then stated that the reason for burying the person after Jumuah salah is that more people will be present. Hazrat replied that these naïve people don’t realize that there is a severe warning for delaying the burial because of their ignorance.” The questioner then said “I have heard of a narration that the angels will not take the account of a person who dies on Friday until the day of Judgement.” Hazrat replied “This is the correct understanding of the Hadith and it refers to the virtues of a Friday. There is no distinction in the Hadith of dying before Jumuah salah or after Jumuah salah.”"
