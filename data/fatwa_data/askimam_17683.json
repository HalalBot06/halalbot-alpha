  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nsalam\n\ni have just visited a barelvi wbsit on which they have made objection on tableeghi and deoband jamat. the links are as follow\nhttp://www.islamicacademy.org/index.htm\nhttp://www.islamicacademy.org/html/Articles/English/Black and White.htm\nhttp://www.islamicacademy.org/html/Articles/English/Tableeghee Jma at-Ahadis.htm\nhttp://www.islamicacademy.org/html/Articles/English/Tableeghee Jma at.htm\n\n\nsome of the objections are as follow. please clear these points as they are confusing me a lot. i have inclined to deoband and tableegh just 2 or 3 years back.\n\nTo have good and strong Imaan, one must have the proper Aqeeda. It is for this reason that we quote a few un-Islamic beliefs of the leaders of the Tableeghi Jamaat together with the proper Islamic answers. The present Molvis and devotees of the T. Jamaat refuse to condemn the persons who wrote such bad beliefs and to even disassociate themesleves from such false beliefs. The un-Islamic beliefs which we have quoted below are quotations from those individuals who possess such beliefs and by writing them in this handbill, we have no intention of Kufr.\n\nFALSE BELIEF 1: \"Allah can speak lies\". (\"Barahine Qaatia\" by Khaleel Ambetwi; \"Yakrozi\" by Ismaeel Dehlwi; \"Fatawa Rasheedia\" by Rasheed Ahmed Gangohi).\nANSWER: Lies is a defect which is not worthy of the Zaat of Almighty Allah and is totally Muhaal (Impossible) for Almighty Allah. Allah is free from all shortages and defects thus making lies Muhaal for Almighty Allah.\n\nFALSE BELIEF 2: \"The Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) had died and is mixed in the sand.\" (\"Taqweeyat-ul Imaan\" by Ismaeel Dehlwi).\nANSWER: It has been stated in the Hadith: \"Verily, Almighty Allah has made it Haraam upon the earth to eat the bodies of the Ambiya\". It has also been stated that Ambiya are alive and are blessed with Sustenance from Almighty Allah.\n\nFALSE BELIEF 3: \"Every creation, no matter how big or small, is equivalent to a cobbler before Allah.\" (\"Taqweeyat-ul Imaan\" by Ismaeel Dehlwi).\nANSWER: The Holy Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) is the most beloved Nabi of Almighty Allah. Almighty Allah took Qasm (Oath) even on the city of the Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). He is the greatest of the creations of Almighty Allah. His every word is accepted in the Court of Allah. He is a perfection in the Attributes of Almighty Allah and Allah has not created any unique being besides Sayyiduna Rasoolullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam).\n\nFALSE BELIEF 4: \"To think of an ox and donkey in Salaah is permissible, but to think of the Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) in Salaah is Shirk (Polytheism).\" (\"Seerate Mustaqeem\" by Ismaeel Dehlwi).\nANSWER: For a Muslim to perform any Ibaadat accepting that it is a noble action of Rasoolullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) is the true sense of Ibaadat. If one reads Namaaz thinking of it as the Sunnah of the Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam), then, without doubt, one will think of the Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). This belief creates in the mind of the performer the thought of the Holy Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). Not only is the thought of the Prophet in Namaaz permissible, it is also the demand of Shari'ah that one must remember the Holy Prophet (salall laahu alaihi wasallam) at the time of Tasha'hud. According to the Fuqaha (Jurists) it is Waajib to believe that the Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) is observing you and that he is aware of your actions.\n\nFALSE BELIEF 5: Any person who says the Nabi to be Haazir and Naazir is a Kaafir. (\"Jawaahirul Quraan\" by Ghulaamullah Khan).\nANSWER: Until and unless we do not accept Rasoolullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) as being Haazir and Naazir, the concept of Risaalat will be incomplete. Our Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) is Shaahid, Mubashir and Nazeer.\n\nFALSE BELIEF 6: To commemorate the Meelad is like commemorating the function of the Hindu deity. (\"Baharine Qaatia\" by Khaleel Ambethwi).\nANSWER: Meelad is a means of gaining blessings and closeness to Almighty Allah. It is the practice of all the great predecessors. Many sources of Shari'ah are available to prove it's authencity. In fact, Rasoolullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) observed fast on Monday as he was born on a Monday.\n\nFALSE BELIEF 7: If Allah wills, then he may create a million Muhammads. (\"Taqweeyatul Imaan\") A Prophet can even come after Muhammad (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). (\"Tahzeerun Naas\")\nANSWER: The doors of Prophethood have been sealed. Muhammad (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) is the Seal of Prophethood. The Prophet also said that no Prophet shall come after him. Any person who claims Nabuwat after the Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) is a Liar, Dajjal Kazaab and a Shaitaan.\n\nFALSE BELIEF 8: \"Rahmatul Lil Alameen\" (Mercy unto the Worlds) is not a special title of the Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam), but the Ummati are also \"Rahmatul Lil Alameen\". (\"Fatawa Rasheedia\")\nANSWER: \"Rahmatul Lil Alameen\" is the unique quality of Rasoolullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) as stated in the Holy Quran.\n\nNote: To believe all these above mentioned false \"Islamic\" beliefs makes one a hypocrite, and one is included in the ranks of the Shia, Rafazi, Khaarijite, Qadiani, Ghair-Muqallid (Ahle Hadith), Tabligi, Deobandi, Maudoodi, Ahle Quran (People of Quran), etc. which are totally out of Islam. Any person who falsely claims to be the true Mahdi is misguided and a Faasiq. Any person who says that Allah can lie, that the Prophet's (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) knowledge are like those of animals, that the Prophet Muhammad (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) is not the Final Messenger, that the swearing of the Sahaba does not make one a criminal, that the Prophet's knowledge is less than Shaitaan, etc. IS A KAAFIR (totally out of the folds of Islam). We should not perform Salaah or associate with such persons as their companionship is detrimental to our Imaan.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAllah has blessed us with the finest of religions. Its purity will always remain. The reason for this is that Allah has preserved its sanctity from generation to generation right until this day. This was through the medium of those selected people whom Allah had chosen for the safeguarding and up keeping of his blessed religion. Allah has not given the understanding of his religion to everyone, rather he as only given it to those whom he wished.\n\nIt is imperative in our religion that we understand things in its context. By not doing so, one may gather a complete different meaning resulting him in being misguided. Not everything in the Quraan and Hadeeth are taken on its apparent meaning. For example, Allah mentions “then whosoever wills, let him believe and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve” (Al-kahf: 29). This verse apparently conveys the meaning that a person may believe or disbelieve. It is a choice given to him by Allah. However, Allama Ibn Katheer (Rahmatullah Alaih) in his commentary explains that this verse serves as a rebuke and warning to the people.\n\nSimilarly, this also applies in the sayings and literature of learned scholars. We should always understand things in its context. This is the underlying factor in all the so called “false beliefs” which you have taken from the website (www.islamicacdemy.com) and sent to us. They are not false beliefs; rather they are misunderstood by those who have commented on them.\n\nWe advise that you be cautious in the websites you browse and the information you accept. At times, incorrect information could create confusion. Be firm in your inclination towards Tabligh and always pray to Allah to keep you on the straight path.\n\nMay Allah guide us all Aameen\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
