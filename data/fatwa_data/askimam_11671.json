  "question": "What is rights of child, husband & wife?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRights?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTHE RIGHTS OF THE HUSBAND%0D%0AAccording to Hazrat Abu Hurayrah Radhiallaahu anhu, Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam said, if I were to command anyone to prostrate before anyone (other than Allah), I would command a woman that she prostrates before her husband. [Mishkat]%0D%0A%0D%0AJust as Allah has placed the parents of a child on a superior rank and commanded him to obey them, He has also placed a husband on a high rank. A woman looks after the chores of the house and her husband earns a livelihood for both of them and their children. A husband spends on his wife as this is her Shar?ee right.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllama Nawawi [Ra] has stated, quoting a verse of the Holy Quran: ?So virtuous women are obedient, guarding in secret what Allah has guarded.? (4:34) In the explanation of this verse the Allamah has said that it is the duty of virtuous women to be obedient (Qaanitah) to Allah, obedient to their husbands in the rights which are due to them and to guard the houses of their husbands in their absence. Guarding the house means:%0D%0A%0D%0AFirstly to guard their own honor and chastity, and Secondly to guard the money and properties of their husbands.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe duties of guarding these values rest on wives, which are confirmed in Sahih-al-Bukhari (the book of Friday #893):%0D%0A%0D%0A?A wife is the protector of the house of her husband, i.e. it is her responsibility to protect the money and property of her husband.? %0D%0A%0D%0AUnder most circumstances it is not binding on a wife to prepare food, but she has been made responsible to protect the money and property of her husband in such a way that they may not be squandered. The Holy Quran has appointed this act of guarding as her essential responsibility.%0D%0A%0D%0ALIFE CANNOT BE BASED ON LAWS ONLY%0D%0AIt has been explained that preparation of food does not fall within the responsibilities of a wife. But this is a matter of legal technicality. However, just as the wife is not responsible legally to prepare food, in the same way a husband is not responsible legally to provide medical treatment to his wife if she falls ill. It is also not the legal responsibility of the husband to take his wife to the house of her parents to see them, nor is it necessary to welcome her parents to his house when they visit the daughter. The jurists have gone to the extent of ruling that the wife?s parents can see their daughter only once in a week, see from a distance only and then go back. The husband is not responsible to welcome them into the house and offer them seats to sit and see their daughter. If life is confined within the thorns of the law, the house hold of both will be doomed. The wheels of life will run smoothly only when both pass their lives according to the way of Nabi S and follow in the footsteps of the sacred wives of Nabi S.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe wife should take care of her husband?s possessions as Hazrat Moulana Thanawi R has stated in his sermons that it is among the duties of a wife to take care of the money of her husband that it may not be wasted and squandered lavishly. If a wife is careless in this matter then she frustrates the requirements of her legal obligations. %0D%0A%0D%0ANabi Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam has said that if a husband calls his wife for his desire, then she must come to him even if she is in the kitchen. [Tirmizi]%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Abu Hurayrah Radhiallaahu anhu has narrated that Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam said: when a husband calls his wife to his bed for intercourse but she does not obey the call or behaves with her husband in such a way that the husband is displeased, then the Angels curse such a woman the whole night till dawn. (Sahih-al-Bukhari)%0D%0A%0D%0ACursing means that the woman will not receive Allah?s mercy that night. This is because in spite of so many rights which the wife enjoys from her husband?s side, she fails to safeguard the chastity of the husband so as to prevent him from falling into illicit relationships. The basic object of marriage is to provide safety against lewdness. If the wife fails to provide this safety the Angles must curse her. %0D%0A%0D%0ASimilarly if a wife leaves her husbands house without his permission, then the Angels of %0D%0AAllah curse her until her return. Nabi S has explained all these matters one by one in full detail, because negligence in these matters may lead to grave consequences. [Discourses on Islamic way of life by Mufti Muhammad Taqi Usmani sahib, page 100]%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Abu Hurayrah Radhiallaahu anhu has narrated Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam said that it is not lawful for a wife to observe optional fast in the presence of her husband except with his permission.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, a good husband will not prevent his wife from optional worship, unless it is unavoidable. He should be liberal in giving permission as far as possible. Undue strictness in this matter leads to tension and bitterness. Both should adopt a flexible attitude in this matter. Although great virtues have been mentioned in the Ahadith for optional forms of worship, still the wife must obey her husband if he does not allow it. The Hadith above shows that Allah and his Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam prefer the husband?s obedience over all optional forms of worship. So the virtue and reward which a wife will earn by obeying her husband will be much more than that from the optional fasting. The wife should not misunderstand that she has been deprived from the virtue of fasting; she should think that I wanted to observe fasts only to earn reward of the hereafter and to please Allah, but instead Allah has said that He shall not be pleased with a wife unless the husband of the wife is pleased with her. Thus, a wife can earn the same reward by eating and drinking which she could earn by observing the fasts if she pleases her husband.%0D%0A%0D%0AA wife should understand that Almighty Allah has imposed on her a duty and the aim of this husband-wife relation is to please the husband and through his pleasure to please Almighty Allah, then this entire affair becomes a source of virtue and reward. The housewives are busy doing household work the whole day from morning till evening. If they do all this with the intention of pleasing their husbands then all this work is recorded in their accounts as worship, whether the work consists of cooking food looking after the house, bringing up the children, minding the comforts and needs of the husband or pleasing the husband with an amicable and warming style of conversation. All these actions are rewarded in the hereafter with divine favors, but only when these are done with pure and sincere intention.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Holy Prophet Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam is reported to have said that it is not obligatory for a woman to serve any individual of the world. She is free from all burdens and all responsibilities, except that she should stay peacefully in her own house, obeying her husband, and bringing up her children with care and love. This is her bounden duty and thereby she would be building the nation and she would be its architect. This is the place of honor which the Holy Prophet Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam has granted to a woman. Now it is up to her to choose between the place of honor or the place of disgrace.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhat is happening today? A woman works as an air hostess serves food to four hundred passengers, stands before them with a tray decorated with drinks and food. She becomes the target of thirsty and greedy gazes of four hundred men. Each passenger on the airplane takes from her a different service, sometimes calling her for nothing but only for lustful enjoyment and exchange of words. The meaning of all this in the lexicon of modern civilization is freedom and emancipation of women. If the same woman provides the same service to her husband, children, brothers and sisters, it is termed as being out of fashion and regarded as opposed to advancement and progress, she is considered to be outdated:%0D%0A%0D%0A?You have named wisdom insanity; and named insanity wisdom; your wonder causing beauty is at liberty to do whatever it likes.? (Poem)%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Umme Salmah Radhiallaahu anhu has narrated that Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam has said if a woman dies in such a state that her husband is pleased with her, she will enter paradise directly. [Tirmizi]%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Muaz bin Jabal Radhiallaahu anhu has narrated that Nabi Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam has said when a wife troubles her husband (because sometimes a woman is ill natured and teases her husband), then his wife whom Allah has ordained for him in paradise in the form of hoor, say to his worldly wife: do not torture him, because he is a guest of yours for a few days and is soon to leave you and come to us.%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam has addressed the following words of admonition to ill-natured women:%0D%0A%0D%0AYou are doing no harm to your husbands by troubling them. You may harm them in this world as you like, but in the Hereafter Almighty Allah shall marry them with Hoors of beautiful eyes who love their worldly husbands so dearly that they are pained to see even now that their worldly husbands are troubled by their worldly wives.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd the woman is a guardian over the house of her husband and his children.%0D%0A%0D%0AThus, the care of two things has been entrusted to the woman, the house of her husband and his children. She is required to guard the house, manage it efficiently in all its affairs, including the care and supervision of the children in matters relating to the world as well as to the faith. %0D%0A%0D%0AThe woman is not only the guardian of the husband?s house but she is also the guardian of his children. Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam has placed on the shoulders of the housewife the responsibility of bringing up and serving and educating them. If the children are not being brought up on the right, if they are not learning the Islamic etiquettes and ways of living, the mother will be questioned first and her husband will be questioned later. She will be asked: why did the children being in your lap remain devoid of the Islamic conduct, character and etiquettes of Islam. Nabi Sallallahu Alayhi wasallam has said: %0D%0A%0D%0AEvery one of you is a caretaker and everyone will be questioned about the person and things placed under his charge. %0D%0A%0D%0AMay Almighty Allah, by His mercy, help us in understanding these obligatory duties and n fulfilling them. Aameen!%0D%0A%0D%0A[Discourses on Islamic way of life by Mufti taqi usmani, vol.2]%0D%0A%0D%0AA person states that one who is harsh on his wife the affect was seen that his wife would call him a pig?s child. As for one who was graceful, polite, courtious, with his wife, the affect was seen that she believes her husband to be a spiritual guide. %0D%0A%0D%0ANabi Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam was always extremely kind and favoring to his wives. We should read about how he S spent his time with his wives and how he favored them. %0D%0A%0D%0AHUSBAND?S RIGHTS:%0D%0A1- Every order is obeyed under the condition that it is not an order of sin%0D%0A2- Do not seek extra maintenance beyond his ability%2Fauthority %0D%0A3- Do not let anyone in the house without the husband?s permission%0D%0A4- Do not go out of the house without his permission %0D%0A5- Do not give anyone anything from his wealth without his permission%0D%0A6- without his permission do not keep a nafil fast whilst he is around%0D%0A7- If he calls for intercourse then do not refuse him unless it is prohibited from the shariah (being in the state of haiz, or nifaas)%0D%0A8- Do not disdain your husband due to poverty or ugliness%0D%0A9- If you see something in your husband which is against the shariah, then stop him respectfully.%0D%0A10- Do not call him by his name%0D%0A11- Do not complain about your husband in front of anyone%0D%0A12- Do not use abusive language with your husband%0D%0A13- Do not argue, fight, debate and dispute, etc. with his relatives%0D%0A[IMDAD-UL-FATAWA, p.186, question 278]%0D%0AThere are many rights from both sides from which some are mentioned above. For more information and details I recommend ?Thuhfat-e-zaujain? written by Moulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi R.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE RIGHTS OF THE WIFE%0D%0A%0D%0AMan is guardian and protector of his household. His wife, children and other members of whom he is head are all included in the meaning of household and he will be questioned in the Hereafter about every member. He will be asked: this household was placed under your control how did you deal with your wife and children? In what manner did you look after them and how did you fulfill their rights? Did you ever take care if they were following the path of religion or not to see if they were going in the direction of Hell? Did you ever pay attention to such vital matters? Man will be questioned about all these things on the Day of Resurrection as has been said in the Holy Quran:%0D%0A%0D%0AO believers save yourselves and your family from the Fire? (66:6)%0D%0A%0D%0ACONSIDER:%0D%0AWhen the relation of wife and husband is established by uttering, the two sacred words of offer and acceptance during the Nikah ceremony, the girl (now a bride) honors the implications of these two words so solemnly that she leaves her parents, brothers and sisters, her hearth and home, her family and the entire clan, and becomes, as it were, a purchased maid of her husband. She has thus become bound to pass her lifetime with a stranger, in a strange house and a strange environment. Will you not take notice of all this sacrifice on the part of that girl who is now your wife and at your exclusive disposal? How would you have felt if the matter had been the reverse; if, after the marriage, you had been asked to leave you family and your parents? What a trying predicament it would have been for you! So have regard for this sacrifice of her and behave with her amicably and fairly.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the Quran it has been stated:%0D%0A%0D%0AYou will not be able to deal equally with (your) wives, however, much you may wish to do so. But turn not altogether away (from one); leaving her in suspense, if you do well and be righteous, then surely Allah is Ever Forgiving, The Merciful. (4:129)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe rights of people are three-fourths of DEEN%0D%0A%0D%0AShariah is divided into four equal parts, only one part will be found to deal with matters relating to worship, and the remaining three parts will be found to contain injunctions with regard to matters that are related to people and their life. [Discourses on Islamic way of life, page 35]%0D%0A%0D%0AAND Almighty Allah said: but consort with them in kindness. (4:19)%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah has addressed all Muslims, commanding them to behave, and consort with women in kindness; associate with them in life with goodwill and sympathy and never give them trouble. This is a general guidance. The Holy Prophet S has explained this verse by his words and practice. He Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam gave such importance to the need of sowing misbehavior to women that he is reported to have said in a Hadith:%0D%0A%0D%0AThe best of you are those who behave well with their women and I am best of you in behaving well with women. (Tirmizi, chapter on right of a woman over her husband#1172)%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam attached so much importance to the protection of the rights of women and ensuring good behavior with them that he has explained this matter in many Hadith. The first Hadith on this subject is one narrated by Hazrat Abu Hurayrah Radhiallaahu anhu wherein Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam is reported to have said:%0D%0A%0D%0AI advise you to wish well for the women. You should accept this advice of mine.%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Muawiyah bin-Hidah Radhiallaahu anhu has narrated that he asked the Holy Prophet Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam: O Prophet Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam of Allah what are the rights of our wives over us? Nabi Sallallahu Alayhi wasallam said when you take food, feed her also and when you wear clothes, provide her also with clothes to wear. Do not beat her on the face, nor curse her. Do not part with her but only within the (bounds of the) house.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHREE STEPS OF REFORMING A WIFE%0D%0A%0D%0AThe differences and disagreements between husband and wife start when the husband feels offended at some action or habit of the wife. The Quran advises that in such a situation the husband should look for some lovely and pleasant quality in the character and dealings of his wife. If the husband fails to discover in his wife any such good points and feels that correction and reform are needed, then the Holy Quran has prescribed the following course to reform and rectify it:%0D%0A%0D%0A?As for those (women) from whom you fear disobedience, admonish them and banish them to beds apart (from yours) and beat them. (4:34)?%0D%0A%0D%0AFirstly, you should advise them in a lenient and polite manner and with love to give up their bad habits and reform themselves. If they respond favorably to admonition and accept your advice, do not go further and treat the chapter as closed. If this does not help and they insist upon their misconduct then the second step is to separate your bed and give up sleeping with them on the same bed. If they have sense, they will surely reform themselves and act upon advice. If this also fails, then it will be necessary to resort to the third step, which is to inflict on the wife some physical punishment; but what kind of physical punishment and to what extent? Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam answered these questions in his sermon on the occasion of his Farewell Hajj in which he said effort should be made so as to settle matters without the expedient of this punishment. If it is found unavoidable, it is permitted only with the condition that it should be very light, the intention being only to enforce discipline and not to inflict pain and injury. It is not lawful beating ones wife in a way that should leave a mark on the body.%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Aisha Radhiallaahu anhu has narrated: Not only did Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam ever raise his hands on any of his wives, but it was also his habit to enter the house with a smiling face.%0D%0A%0D%0ASACRIFICES OF THE WOMAN FOR YOUR SAKE%0D%0ANabi Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam has said in a Hadith: how tremendous a sacrifice the woman has undergone for your sake. If the matter was just the reverse and it were said to you, you would have to leave your family, your parents, after your marriage what an awkward situation it would be for you. As for the woman she has become confined to a strange surrounding, a strange house and a strange person and that, too, for the rest of her life. That is why Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam has said in his Tradition: Will you not mind this sacrifice? Do take heed of this and treat her well and with love.%0D%0A%0D%0AThereafter the Holy Prophet Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam has spoken a very serious sentence of far-reaching consequences. When the meaning of this sentence is explained to men they get annoyed. The meaning of that sentence is as follows:%0D%0A%0D%0AThat according to the laws of the Shariah the only demand you can make of them is that they should live with you in your house, you have no other claim upon them.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis clarifies that to serve the in-laws is not obligatory. She is not responsible to cook food for the parents,%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah has given rights to a husband. To keep the husband happy is a great ibadat, and to upset him is a great sin. Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam has said which ever women prays 5 times namaz, and keeps the fast of Ramadan and keeps herself safe and pure, and obeys her husband, then she has a choice a choice to enter from any door of jannat. This means that from the 8 doors of jannat, she may choose the door she desires to enter jannat.%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Umm-Salma Radhiallaahu anha has narrated that Hazrat Maimuna Radhiallaahu anha and I were present in Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam?s service and during this time Ibn umm-maktum (a blind sahabi came). Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam said, ?cover yourselves (do purdah)? to both of us. We asked that isn?t he blind? He can?t see us and nor can he recognize us. Nabi S replied are you blind as well? Can you not see him? (Tirmizi- Abu Dawud)%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom this Hadith we can understand that it is the right on a wife to do such purdah from non mehram men that nor can she see him and nor he see her.%0D%0A%0D%0AIbn Abi Aufa has narrated that Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam has said by Him (Allah) who has Muhammad Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam?s soul in His grasp, a women will not fulfill the rights of her Lord until she does not fulfill her husband?s rights. [Ibn Majah]%0D%0A%0D%0AJust by keeping fast and praying namaz, no women should think that I have fulfilled Allah?s rights, because it doesn?t fully complete His rights; until she does not fulfill her husbands? rights as Allah is the one who gave the order to fulfill the husband?s rights.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is also a women?s responsibility to make the man deendar (religious). Women don?t take it important to save their husbands from the fire of hell. I.e. whether her husband brings halal food or haram food for her, yet she is careless that he is involved in haraam for our sake. Or if he is getting income via haraam and halal means, then she should try to stop him and say we will live on halal means, it is enough.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf a women wants to make her husband religious then there is no difficulty, first she should be religious and pray namaz, fast, then advice her husband, then inshallah it will affect him.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is a wajib right for a wife to have a separate place to live with her husband.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is not jaiz for the wife to spend her husbands wealth without his pleasure and nor for a husband to spend his wife?s wealth without her pleasure. %0D%0A%0D%0ASometimes women take their husbands money and use it to fill the house or with some excuse she gives to her father or mother which is a great sin. The wife?s relatives have no sharii right from her husband?s wealth. If she wants to give then she must take permission. Yes the money that her husband gives to her as her own (free to spend according to her will), she may give this money to whomever she wills.%0D%0A%0D%0ASome people think that men are higher (virtuous) over women in every aspect altogether and that women are nothing aligned with men. This is wrong. In fact in some things she is equal to man and in other things she can surpass man. Meaning according to actions: by praying namaz, keeping fast, then she can increase to a higher status.%0D%0A%0D%0AShariat is the order of Allah and Rasul Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam. In front of Allah and Rasul Sallallahu Alayhi wasallam, the husbands order will not be accepted. Every woman is equal in this as she must obey Allah and Rasul S?s order. But if the husbands order is not against deen, it must be given priority, as the rights of a husband is the most important after the order of Allah and Rasul Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam.%0D%0A%0D%0ADue to the reason that Allah and Rasul Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam?s order is not known to the general masses, but is learnt from the Ulama (scholars) and Mashaik, then it can be said that rights of the Ulama are more than the husband as the Ulama are those who tell you the order of Shariah. %0D%0A%0D%0AIf women had to act upon the husbands order in every matter then many people would have been deprived of Allah?s worship, which is the real purpose to the creation of humans. It has been stated: and we have created jinn and insaan (humans) for worship. This is why priority should always be given to Allah in every matter.%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi Ra has stated in his book Tuhfat-u-zaujain that I am of the opinion that it is not waajib upon a woman to cook food. And I take proof from the Quran which states:%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd among His signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy. [Surah rum, ayat 21]%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore women were made to ease your hearts and to entertain and amuse you, not for cooking bread.%0D%0A%0D%0AA person once asked that is it wajib upon the wife to cook? It was answered diyanatan (with Allah) it is wajib and qazaan (judicially) it is not (If a husband says to then diyanatan it is wajib and this is manifest from a Hadith).%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the Hadith it has been stated that if husband orders his wife to take the black mountains stone to the White Mountain and the White Mountains? stone to the black mountain, then she should do this. If the amount of emphasis in obeying the husband is this much, then to cook food is less in position.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is not only her right that you give her food and clothes, but also to make her heart happy.%0D%0A%0D%0AWIFE?S RIGHTS%0D%0AThe following has been written in thuhfat-u-zaujain by Moulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi R. %0D%0A%0D%0AThe rights of a wife under the responsibility of a husband are as follows:%0D%0A1- husn khulq meaning to come forth with good etiquette and character and to behave well with her.%0D%0A2- To tolerate eeza (meaning difficulty from the wife) with moderation.%0D%0A3- To be moderate in her modesty meaning do not be suspicious of her and nor totally negligent.%0D%0A4- Be moderate in spending. In other words don?t be tight in spending, nor give her permission to spend on useless needs.%0D%0A5- Learn the ahkaam of her monthly cycle and teach her, and keep emphases on namaz and deen (religion), and stop her from bidaat as well as from those things which are not jaiz. %0D%0A6- If you have more than one wife then have justice and be equal with their rights.%0D%0A7- Do intercourse with her to the extent of necessity.%0D%0A8- Without her permission do not do azal (coitus interruptus)%0D%0A9- According to his ability, he gives her a house to live in.%0D%0A10- To let the wife meet with her mahaarim, close relatives, mother, father, uncle, paternal aunt, brother sisters, etc.%0D%0A11- Not to disclose secrets of intercourse etc.%0D%0A12- Not to hit her except as a last resort and that too within the limits the limits of the Shari?ah.%0D%0A13- Not to give her a divorce without need.%0D%0AThere are many rights of husband and wife from which some are mentioned above. [Imdad-ul-fatawa page185]%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is also the right of a wife that the husband sleeps with her. Moreover it is her right to keep her happy and converse with her. There are some people who are known as buzrug?s, they pray namaz, fast, they are steadfast in zikr, near them it is like they are buying jannah, yet they are negligent of their wives? rights. Remember! It is also the rights of a wife that you converse with her and listen to her problems and comforts, and keep her happy by entertaining her or amusing her. But both religious and non religious people are negligent from this right as they do not think it is a right under their responsibility! They are under the false impression that food and clothes is their sole responsibility.%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is wajib to give her nafqa whether she is wealthy or poor%0D%0A%0D%0ATo give her a separate house is also included in nafqa, and a right of the wife.%0D%0A%0D%0AHow much wealth Allah has bestowed upon you, the way you spend on yourselves, likewise give her to spend as well. This is what the Shariah has taught us.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn fact if the man is wealthy enough, he should get a maid servant for work.%0D%0AIf due to some reason she is ill, and not capable to cook, then the husband doesn?t have to get a servant, in fact he should bring cooked food. [Durr muktar 183]%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam?s character with his wives was such that as Hazrat Aisha Radhiallaahu anha was young then according to her age he would entertain her.%0D%0A%0D%0AOnce Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam had a race with her and Hazrat Aisha Radhiallahu anha won. Another time they raced again, she had gained some weight and his time Nabi Sallallahu Alayhi wasallam won. Thereafter he said this is payback for the first race. %0D%0A%0D%0ANabi Sallallahu Alayhi wasallam even gave Hazrat Aisha Radhiallaahu anha permission to play with dolls. The dolls during there time were different. They would tie an ordinary cloth about 3 times which would seem like a person to the children. Many other incidents took place which we should read and take heed from. %0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE RIGHTS OF A CHILD%0D%0AIt is reported by Hazrat Abu Saeed and Hazrat Abdullah Ibn Abbas Radhiallaahu anhu that the Messenger of Allah Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam said, ?He who has a child born to him should give it a good name and a good education and marry him%2Fher when he%2Fshe reaches puberty. If he does not marry the child when it reaches puberty and the child commits sin, the guilt rests only upon its father.? (Bai-Haqi)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe first thing that is advised is to give good names to ones children. It is the duty of the parents and a right of the children that they be given good names. A Hadith tells us, ?On the Day of Resurrection you will be called by your names and the names of your fathers, therefore, have good names.? [Abu Dawood]%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Aisha Radhiallaahu anhu has said: that the Holy Prophet Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam always changed a named that was derogatory or bad. [Tirmizi]%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam said, ?Give the names of the Prophets, the names dearest to Allah are Abdullah and Abdur Rahman and the worst of names are Harb and Marrah.? [Mishkat]%0D%0A%0D%0AHarb is warfare and Marrrah is bitter. Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam called these the worst of names. Man is created for good will and compassion. How can a name meaning ?warfare? be acceptable. A believer is taught to be well mannered and good-natured and to be loving, then how can a mane that means ?bitter? apply to him. Parents gave names of Prophets Alayhimus salaam and these qualities are reflected in the lives of the bearers of the names. However, most of the people have chosen new names and we have ?Parveen?, Parwaiz?, ?Ghazala and Shaheen?.
