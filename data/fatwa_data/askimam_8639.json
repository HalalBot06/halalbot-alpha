  "question": "1.Can u quote any hadith which mentions the group which does not do Taqleed of any one particular imam is deviant",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam o alaikum Mufti Saheb, May Allah award you for this noble work . Par Mufti Sahab i have a small query . In most of your answers it has been observed that you just mention the Hadith but fail to mention the HAdith no. or page no. of the Hadith, which makes us doubtful whether the Hadith you are quoting is really present or not. So mufti saheb i would request you to please mention hadith no. in answers which contain Hadiths. Thanks My question 1. Can u quote any hadith which mentions the group which does not do Taqleed of any one particular imam is deviant. or How will u measure a deviant group from a right group? Please answer with proofs from Quran and Hadith? 2. Why does Tableegh Jamaat does not say anything regarding current events, like shameful acts of gujarat, injustice done to innocent muslims, oppression etc. you just ask to make dua. no doubt that dua is important, even those who are actively fighting this injustice and oppression are also making dua and fighting as well. My question is after discussion with most of the Tableegh seniors as well as junorios regarding this, i get the same answer make dua.. Y not do something and as well make dua... How can it be right when you have the power, have so many followers, but still you do not raise voice against oppression . this is really surprising??\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Any person who does not follow one particular Imaam is inevitably going to follow his desires. The Qur?aan and Hadith are replete with proofs against following one?s desires. This is besides the verses of the Qur?aan and Ahaadith which substantiate the issue of following one particular Imaam. It is obvious that any person or group failing to comply with the dictates of these proofs will be deviant. The following verses and Ahaadith are the references that you require: Surah Nisaa v59; Surah Nisaa v83; Surah Tawbah v123; Surah Nahl v43. All these and many more are proofs of Taqleed in general. Similarly, looking at various Ahaadih, you may check Musnad Ahmad Hadith Nos.23169; 15318; 12633 and the following of one specific Imaam can be proven from Sahih Bukhari Hadith1758; 6736 and Abu Dawud Hadith3587%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The Tabligh Jamaat is not an organisation, party or some welfare society funded by anyone. It is a unique universal effort which aims at bringing alive 100% Deen in the lives of the whole of mankind. The Tabligh Jamaat does not degrade or criticise other organisations or other people who are involved in current issues. The fact of the matter is this that Tabligh wishes to make humanity aware of the fact that these current issues (like the one?s you mentioned and others) have all erupted because we have left Deen. Therefore, in reality, the Tabligh Jamaat is making an all out effort to bring the awareness of Deen in the lives of people so that Allah Ta?ala will become happy with us and then good conditions will prevail.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
