  "question": "Promise to marry broken due to these reasons - acceptable or not?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was asked for my hand in marriage by a brother a year ago. His condition was that I move to the city where he was staying. I planned on moving there recently so we can marry and was told by the brother that he cannot marry me anymore. He did not give a reason for this. I spoke to his brother who told me that he felt that he cannot give me the life I deserve and does not want me to give up my good job to move to where he lives since if I get a job in his city it will not be as good as the one I have now. He does care about me. I have developed feelings for this man and I feel that I would rather marry him than keep my good job. Were his reasons for breaking his promise to marry me valid?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala says, 'Fulfil promises. Verily, you would be questioned\nregarding promises which you made.' It is improper of the brother to mislead\nyou into believing that he will marry you.\n\nSister, if this brother is destined for you, you will marry him. If the\nperson is not interested, it would be better if you could carry on with your\nlife and do not let this bother you. May Allah Ta'ala grant you a suitable\nmarriage partner, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
