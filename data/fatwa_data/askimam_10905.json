  "question": "With taymum (instead of obligatory ghusul) can I read Quran and other suras? Can I go for permanent sterilization?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nQ1. I am suffering from two prolapsed disc and pain from last couple of years. I already have kids? one boy and one girl. I cannot carry even 2 to 3 kg weight. My spinal cord starts paining. Doctors advised me not to have more children as it can lead to further herniation of my discs. My husband is not interested in having more kids but he does not want to use contraceptives. Can I go for permanent sterilization? Is it permissible in Islam as having more kids can lead to my serious physical problem? Q2. We are married from last 10 years. My husband used to do intercourse twice or max thrice a week. But now after my illness he wants to have sex nearly everyday. He is very loving and caring husband and helps me a lot but in this matter he cannot control himself. I can take bath only once in 3 to 4 days because of bad health. I was doing taymum and praying. But when ever I take bath that same day he wants to have sex. I am basically God fearing women, I feel very guilty to pray everyday only with taymum. I feel very helpless. If I keep my husband happy everyday then I have severe guilty feeling for my prayers. I cannot tolerate my husband marrying any girl and see them together. Please guide me. Please give some dua so that his sexual urge decreases a little. Q3. With taymum (instead of obligatory ghusul) can I read Quran and other suras.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1)If a reliable Muslim doctor informs you that having a child will be%0D%0Adetrimental to your health, and there is no hope of the situation%0D%0Areversing, then only permanent sterilization will be permissible. %0D%0A2)If there is genuine fear that bathing after every copulation, your%0D%0Asickness will be aggravated, then it will be permissible to make%0D%0Atayammum. However, the meaning of bathing is not only confines to%0D%0Aremaining in the shower for 15-30 minutes. It suffices in bathing even%0D%0Aif you take water in your hands and pass the water over your entire body%0D%0Ajust once. If your hair is plaited, there is no need to open the plaits%0D%0Aif water reaches the roots of the hair. It is sufficient to pass water%0D%0Aover the entire plait, even if water doesn't reach into the plaited%0D%0Ahair. You should therefore adopt this simple manner of bathing, and you%0D%0Amay request your husband to assist you. If this type of bathing will%0D%0Aalso deteriorate your condition, you may resort to tayammum, but only%0D%0Auntil the time when you can bath safely. (Tahtaawi pg. 91-92 Noor%0D%0AMohammad)%0D%0A3)It is permissible to read the Quraan with tayammum, only if the%0D%0Atayammum was performed because there was no other alternative.%0D%0A(Tahtaawi)%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
