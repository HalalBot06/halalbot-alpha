  "answer": "QUESTION\nI recently performed an istikhara and saw a dream in which I had sat down to read the Quran and someone kept on putting a pink rose, as a bookmark, at a certain surah. I am not exactly sure as to which surah it was but I am most inclined to thinking it was Surah- Al Mujadilah. Also in the same dream I saw that I was in an airplane and there was a delay because of 20 passengers who had some sort of problem and were not able to board so then it was agreed that 20 Shuyukh would take their places. I felt very comfortable once they boarded. And everyone was happy and carried out conversations.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person sees himself/herself reciting Surah Mujadalah in the dream, the person will engage in fighting and refuting falsehood. May Allah accept you for that and keep you in the company of Ulama Rabbaniyyeen. Ameen\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
