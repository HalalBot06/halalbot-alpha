  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nOne of my friend works for bank (involved in the interested based business), what should i do if that person send me a gift (like food item etc). Is it haram for me to consume any gift from a person whose income is from haram source. If its so then how come i can make sure the person who is inviting me to party, or sending me gift got this income from halal source.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf you are certain that the gift is from a Haraam source, you should not consume or use it.\n\nA Muslim who gives you something or invites you for a meal, you may accept even if you do not know the source of his income. However, if you are certain his income is Haraam, you should refrain.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
