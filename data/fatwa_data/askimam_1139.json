  "question": "We avoid all sorts of MASKUK (not confirmed) food items. What if we become guest and they are using haram.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMany people are not particular about halal and haram. Even one tells them they say no it is halal. If we are guest at one's home and refuse to eat they become upset and this way we cannot have talks of deen specaillay in GAHAST and JAMAT. They will not come close.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, if a reliable and trustworthy Muslim informs that the food is Halaal, his word will be accepted and it is permissible to consume such food.\n\nIf the person is not trustworthy and one?s doubt is based on substantial grounds, then one should abstain from consuming such food. We suggest that one apply wisdom and diplomacy in explaining the reason for abstain from such food and request sea food, or a vegetable dish be prepared to facilitate for them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
