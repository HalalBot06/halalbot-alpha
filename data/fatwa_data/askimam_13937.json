  "question": "made arrangements with other guest houses that in case this guest house is full then the manager asks other guest houses to accommodate their customers.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy son is working in a guest house in Islamabad - Pakistan.  Due to earth quake situation this business is going on very well.  The guest house is a reputed one and many guests come to this guest house for residence.  As the capacity is not much hence the guest house has made arrangements with other guest houses that in case this guest house is full then the manager asks other guest houses to accommodate their customers.  In other words this guest house manager is giving business to other guest houses when asked by the customers who could not get room in this guest house (being house full)due to its reputation.  The arrangement with other guest houses has been made is that when ever the manager of the guest house sends any customer to other guest houses, they pay a certain amount i.e. Rs. 400 or 500 per customer to the manager of this guest house for sending the customers to them.  The question is whether this money being paid by these guest houses to my son, who is the manager of this guest house, is Halal or not.  Pl. keep in mind that the customers insists (due to reputation of this guest house) that the manager should make efforts to accommodate them in some other good and reliable guest house and the manager makes personal efforts to accommodate those customers in other good guest houses.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe guest house is an agent for the other guest houses.\n\nIt is permissible for the guest house to charge agency fees to other guest houses. Your son’s income is Halaal.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
