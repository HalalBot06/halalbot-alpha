  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSalaams, I was talking to a non-Muslim friend of mine who comes from a Christian background. He was wondering about the theological background regarding Adam (pbuh) and Eve and \"original sin.\" I know that concept does not count in Islam because we are all responsible for our own sins and we do not need a savior, however I was unable to answer his question because I was not aware of the theological perspective of Adams descent on earth. I was wondering if you could answer this question. I know that Adam was always meant to be sent down to earth, but was he sent down on earth because he ate the forbidden fruit? My friend further questioned why we all weren't born with Allah because we are all born without sin, and why we are all \"punished\" to live on earth for Adam's sin. If Adam was not sent on earth because of the fruit, was there a reason that Allah chose that moment to send Adam on earth? My friend believed that God would not \"act out of whim\" like that. I know Allah has His reasons for everything, but I was wondering the Islamic theological perspective of this concept. JazakAllah Khair for all your help Walaikum Salaams -Sarah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nThe Christian concept of original sin does not only go against Islamic teachings, but also goes against the Bible.\n\n \n\n\"The father shall not be put to death for the children, neither the children be put to death for their father: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.\" Deuteronomy 24:16\n\n \n\n\"... But everyone shall die for his own iniquity...\" Jeremiah 31:30\n\n \n\n\"The soul that sinneth, it shall die, the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.\" Ezekiel 18:20\n\n \n\n\"Judge not, that ye be not judged. For what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\" Matthew 7:1-2\n\n \n\n \"...and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.\" I Cor. 3:8\n\n \n\nTo prove that children are born without sin, Jesus asked not to let children suffer,\n\n\"But Jesus said suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.\" Matthew 19:14\n\n \n\nMen’s decent on earth was not as a punishment; rather it was one of the reasons of men’s creation. Allah Ta’ala mentions in the Noble Quran:\n\n \n\nوإذ قال ربك للملائكة إني جاعل في الأرض خليفة (البقرة 30)\n\nWhen your Lord said to the angels I am going to create a deputy in earth. (2:30)\n\n \n\nوما خلقت الجن والإنس إلا ليعبدون (الذاريات56)\n\nI have not created jinn and men except that they worship me. (51:56)\n\n \n\nFrom these verses we understand that the purpose of men’s creation is for him to be Allah Ta’ala’s vicegerent on earth, and for him to recognize and worship his Lord.\n\n \n\n \n\nAllah Ta’ala mentions in the Noble Quran:\n\nلا يسأل عما يفعل وهم يسألون (23)\n\nHe is not questioned of what He does, and they are questioned. (21:23)\n\nThere is most definitely wisdom in whatever Allah Ta’ala does whether we understand it or not. We do not have any right to question what Allah Ta’ala does.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl. Ishaq E.
