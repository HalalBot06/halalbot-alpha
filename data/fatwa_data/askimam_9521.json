  "question": "During salat are there any faults in which we have to repeat the namaz and Sajda Sahu is nor permissible. Please list all",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nto repeat the namaz and Sajda Sahu is nor permissible. Please list all. Should the sleeves of shirt be without button or buttons are also permissible\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, if a person omits a Fardh act in Salaat intentionally or unintentionally, the Salaat will be invalid. He cannot compensate for that by performing Sajda-e-Sahw. He has to repeat the Salaat.\n\nSimilarly, if a person omits a Waajib act in Salaat intentionally, he cannot make up for that through Sajda-e-Sahw. A person may make Sajda-e-Sahw only if he omits a Waajib act in Salaat unintentionally. If a person?s sleeves are without buttons, and the loose sleeves do not distract a person in Salaat, it will be permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
