  "question": "Is it permissible to know the gender of the baby before birth?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs part of the routine tests for pregnant women the doctors in US suggest Ultrasound; to monitor the health of the baby. The test (Ultrasound) can also reveal the sex of the baby, is it permissible to know the sex of the baby before birth?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to our understanding, a sensor is placed on the abdomen of a\nfemale and the picture of the womb is reflected on the screen.\n\nIf so, it is prohibited for a female to unnecessarily reveal her entire or\npart of her body to a male physician / gynaecologist. If the scan was\nconducted by a female, then it is not prohibited. As regards knowing the\ngender of the child through the scan, it is not prohibited. However,\nexperience have revealed that the information is not always correct. That\ncan be very disturbing to parents.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
