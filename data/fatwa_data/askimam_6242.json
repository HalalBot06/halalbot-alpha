  "answer": "QUESTION\nI want to know about gheebat. I know what gossiping is. For no reason saying bad things about people behind their back. But is it gheebat if someone said something you didn't like and you want to talk to your friends, family or someone about it to feel better? Is complaining gheebat? Is talking about other people gheebat?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. To talk to your friends, family or someone about this to feel better is\nnot Gheebat.\n2. Talking bad about other people is Gheebat. The definition of Gheebat is\n'to talk about someone with regards to a fault found in him her which, if\nhe/she has to hear what you have said, he/she will feel bad.' (Tirmidhi\nvol.2 pg.15)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
