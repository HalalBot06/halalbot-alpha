  "question": "2 Questions: Wasiyyat and Sajdah Tilawat",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu Alaikum, I have 2 questions: - Is it mandatory for every adult Muslim to have a wasiyyat (will) regardless of age? - If I have to repeat an ayat with a sajdah in it many times for the purpose of memorization, do I need to perform sajdah that many times?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said that it is\ninappropriate for a person to spend even two nights without having written a\nwill. (Bukhari vol.1 pg.382). This Hadith draws our attention towards the\nimportance of preparing a Will.\n2. If one is seated in the same place and repeats the verse of Sajdah many\ntimes, then only one Sajdah will be compulsory.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
