  "question": "I am so scared of death and the punishment to come in the hereafter. What should I do? Regarding covering of body and face.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAt times I get really terrified of dying, the hereafter and judgement day. I feel as if I am going to go mad every time I think of it. I cry alot as I imagine dying and facing the punishments I will receive for doing all the wrong that I have committed. At these times I remember all the bad things I have done and vow to be better but I still remain the same person committing wrong. I get scared of sleeping and am also afraid of the dark at times. Now I can?t even cry as I get so afraid. This usually happens in the night and as I try to sleep I keep thinking of myself in my grave in the dark all alone. I lose hope in going to Jannah and for my sins to be forgiven. Why is this happening? I try to pray all my salahs and have even started to wear hijab a couple of months ago. I know that at this present time it is advisable for women to conceal themselves entirely (body & face) when venturing outdoors. InsahAllah I want to start wearing nikab but I have a query. If non-mahrems come to my home to stay or have a meal is it sufficient just to have hijab and a cloak on or do I have to cover my face as well. And if I live with my in-laws (I have brother in-laws)will I be required to keep my self completely covered body & face as this would be difficult as that would mean that I would have to be in purdah all the time. Please advice me. JazakAllah for your assistance May Allah bless us all with strong Iman.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhile Allah is indeed Severe in punishment, He is also most Forgiving and%0D%0AMerciful. One should be concious of the fear of Allah but should never lose%0D%0Ahope in His mercy. Correct Taqwa is a balance between hope and fear. Once%0D%0Aone has made Tawba (repentance), his sins are as if they have never been. A%0D%0AHadith states \"One who repents of a sin is like one who has had no sin at%0D%0Aall.\"%0D%0A%0D%0ARegarding your query on Hijaab, it is necessary to observe Hijaab, (and this%0D%0Ameans facial covering as well) from non-Mahrams at all times except in case%0D%0Aof extreme necessity. If a non Mahram male is elderly and there is no fear%0D%0Aof any fitnah (mischief) from him, there is some room for concession.%0D%0ABrother-in-laws are no exception to the laws of Purdah. Full facial covering%0D%0Amust be observed. In one Hadith, Nabi (s.a.w) gave express warning against%0D%0Anon observance of Hijaab from the brother-in-law. He said; \"The brother-%0D%0Ain-law is death.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AIf it becomes too difficult, you are entitled to request your husband to%0D%0Aprovide you with seperate or at least semi-detached living arrangements.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Bilaal Cassim%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
