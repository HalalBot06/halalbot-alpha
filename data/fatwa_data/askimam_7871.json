  "question": "If I am fasting, and in some way or form lose my Islam(get kicked and become kafir); but make shahada after that before sunset, is the fast accepted?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI again failed to make known what my question was. Forgive me. I asked if kufr destroys fast if shahada is made and was told to elaborate. I shall insha Allah:If I am fasting, and in some way or form lose my Islam(get kicked and become kafir); but make shahada after that before sunset, is the fast accepted?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs soon as you leave the fold of Islam the fast is nullified. Therefore, the fast is broken and not acceptable.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
