  "question": "Can I marry my fiance without letting out parents know, so we can hangout together, and do the nikah again in 2 years time?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised, 'Announce the Nikah.'%0D%0A(Mishkaat)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe wisdom behind the announcement is to avoid any misconception of an%0D%0Aillegal and illicit relationship between the boy and girl. Although the%0D%0Afirst and secret marriage for the purpose of legalizing intimacy will be%0D%0Avalid and the relationship between the boy and girl will not be prohibited,%0D%0Abut we are also advised to abstain from doubt and disgrace. If the Nikah is%0D%0Anot announced, people witnessing the relationship will regard the%0D%0Arelationship as Haraam and illegal. That is very disgraceful.%0D%0A%0D%0AFurthermore, what if the girl conceives and gives birth before the official%0D%0A'second' marriage. That child will be regarded as an illegitimate child in%0D%0Apublic. The%0D%0Anegative factors surrounding that as well as the child for the rest of his%0D%0Alife are well known. Therefore, we advise that if there is a dire need to%0D%0Afulfil one's desires, the Nikah be expediated to avoid the abovementioned%0D%0Anegative factors of a secret marriage.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
