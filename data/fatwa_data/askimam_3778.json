  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease provide a detailed response.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMAJOR SIGNS LEADING TO THE DAY OF JUDGMENT%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Muslims reach the peak of their military power.%0D%0A2. AL-MAHDI will appear just before the time of the Dajjaal. He will call to%0D%0Athe true Islam, and will be a military leader.%0D%0A3. THE DAJJAAL will come claiming to be god holding Heaven and Hell. His%0D%0Apurpose is to deceive, and unbelievers will follow him.%0D%0A4. EESA (Alayhis salaam), will descend at the time of Fajr Salaat on a%0D%0AMasjid in Damascus, Syria. He will call people back to Islam, but he will%0D%0Aalso be a military leader. The people of the book will revert to Islam, and%0D%0Awealth will be super-abundant. He will break the cross, kill the swine, and%0D%0Aslay the Dajjaal.he will stay on Earth for a long time thereafter, and then%0D%0Adie.%0D%0A5. THE DAABBAH (an animal) will come and call people back to Islam. The%0D%0Adescription of the animal is unknown.%0D%0A6. JAJOOJ AND MAJOOJ (two hidden tribes of people) will break free of the%0D%0Adam that holds them back, and ravage the earth. They will drink all the%0D%0Awater, and kill people until Allah sends against them a worm which will wipe%0D%0Athem out. This is roughly before %2F during the time of Eesa (Alayhis salaam),%0D%0Aalthough it is not entirely clear.%0D%0A7. SMOKE will appear all over the earth which will cause believers to catch%0D%0Asomething similar to a slight cold, whereas the unbelievers will be hit%0D%0Aharder by it. Finally, a cold wind will come and kill all believers, leaving%0D%0Aonly unbelievers on the earth who will then witness the LAST HOUR. The angel%0D%0AIsrafil will blow a trumpet, and the resurrection of all human beings will%0D%0Abegin. At this point, the Day of Resurrection commences in which the skies%0D%0Aand earth are destroyed by Allah, the Mighty.%0D%0A%0D%0AHOW TO PROTECT ONESELF FROM THE DAJJAAL%0D%0AThe Dajjaal will come at a time when the Muslims emerge victorious from the%0D%0Aal-Malhamah. His purpose will be to destroy the Islamic military power which%0D%0Awill have defeated, the Christians. However, the Muslims will not put down%0D%0Atheir arms but will prepare themselves to fight the Dajjaal. It is the duty%0D%0Aof every Muslim to fight the Dajjaal if he lives to witness him, by joining%0D%0Athe Muslim forces under the banner of Jihaad the sake of preserving the%0D%0ADeen.%0D%0A%0D%0AProphet Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) warned us, 'Whoever hears%0D%0Aabout the coming of the Dajjaal should stay away from him because by Allah,%0D%0Aa man could come to him believing he is a strong believer but then he follow%0D%0Ahim because of the doubts he will spread.' (Abu Dawud). He (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) has shown us how to protect ourselves from the Dajjaal.%0D%0A%0D%0ASEEK REFUGE WITH ALLAH%0D%0AProphet Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) commanded the Muslims to seek%0D%0Arefuge with Allah from the Dajjaal in every Salaat. He, himself, used to say%0D%0Aa supplication at the end of each prayer after the last tashahhud which%0D%0Ameans, 'O Allah! I seek refuge with you from the punishment of Hell and from%0D%0Athe punishment of the grave, from the trials of life and death, and from the%0D%0Atribulations of the Dajjaal.' (Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE CAVE (Surah al-Kahf)%0D%0AProphet Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) told us as reported in the%0D%0ASahih of Muslim, that whoever lives to witness the Dajjaal, let him memorise%0D%0Aand recite the last ten verses of Surah al-Kahf (Chapter 18) and he will be%0D%0Aprotected from the Dajjaal.%0D%0A%0D%0ATAKING REFUGE IN MAKKAH AND MADINAH%0D%0AProphet Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'There will be no town%0D%0Athe Dajjaal will not visit, except Makkah and Madinah, for all of their%0D%0Agates will be guarded by angels that will be surrounding the.' (Bukhari and%0D%0AMuslim). So, it is there that Muslims will be safe from the Dajjaal.%0D%0A%0D%0AAl-Jumuah vol.11 issue9"
