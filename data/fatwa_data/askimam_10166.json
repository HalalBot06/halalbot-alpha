  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow will i know which way to make my decision as i did istikharah and on the next few days my parents agreed to meet the family of the man i want to marry, however, i carried on doing istikharah and then things went a little bad between ma and my man...should i carry on with the istikharah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOne makes Istikharah when one seeks the help of Allah in decision one needs to make. As you say that things have went badly between your mother and the man, does this mean that the request that he made for your hand in marriage has been turned down or does it mean that there is just a difference of opinion between the both of them. If the latter is true then you could continue to make Istikharah and wait for a sign because differences can be worked out.\n\nHowever if the decision has been given and you have not received a sign as yet then you should stop the Isthikarah because the reason for it has been taken away.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
