  "question": "What is the fatwa about an unmarried christian man who had illegal sexual relations with another christian female but then embraces islam",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is the fatwa about an unmarried christian man who had illegal sexual relations with another christian female but then embraces islam.Will his crime be forgiven or he has to undergo hadd like other muslims because hazrat muhammad (pbuh) in his life inflicted hadd punishment on a jew man and  woman.And can a muslim woman marry such man??\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn an Islamic country, if a non-Muslim committed the crime of adultery, then hadd will be inflicted on him only if the person confesses in front of a Qaadhi or he is caught committing the crime and that is proven by four reliable witnesses in front of a Qaadhi. If the person does not confess, or if a person/s caught him committing the crime and that was not taken to the Qaadhi, then the laws of hadd will not be inflicted upon the person.\n\nIn fact, it is advisable for the individual to conceal his wrong and not take it further. This is also the advise to those who seen the person committing the crime. They should conceal the fault of a person and help to reform him. If the person in question accepts Islam, all his sins are forgiven. It is permissible to marry such a person.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
