  "answer": "QUESTION\nMe and my wife have recently decided to go for hajj this coming December.  My question to you is that we owe the bank £20,000.00 mortgage and i also owe my father £13,000.00.  Will it be permissable for us to go to hajj even though when we return we will still be incurring sin by paying interest on our mortgage.  My father does not want his money for many years to come and has given us permission to go.  We have intention of paying the mortgage off as soon as possible.  Please reply\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The principle in Shari’ah is Jalbe Manfa’at (derive benefit) is preferred over Daf-e-Madarrat (removing harm).\n\nInterest is prohibited and a major sin. If one has a liability and does not have excess funds, Hajj is not compulsory. It is, in fact, compulsory to get rid of the debt as soon as possible. Therefore, if you have money, pay off the debts and if you have excess money, then perform Hajj. This will be in conformity to the above mentioned principle to avoid hard over deriving benefit.\n\n2. According to the Shari’ah laws of Inheritance and Succession, a son will inherit twice the amount than a daughter. It cannot be stipulated that both the son and daughter inherit in equal shares.\n\n3. A crab is not fish and cannot be eaten according to the Hanafi Madhab. Lobsters, prawns and crayfish are crustaceas and not fish. Some regard them as fish. It is best to exercise precaution and abstain.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
