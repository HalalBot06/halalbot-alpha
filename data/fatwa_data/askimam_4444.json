  "question": "Please interpret my dream",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI had a dream on one of the odd nights of Ramadan. During this dream i awoke all of a sudden and found the moon growing bigger and bigger until it covered the entire sky. I tried waking up my sisters and roommate but they wouldnt get up. I kept on repeating \"Its Lailatul Qadr. Its Lailatul Qadr.\" Then a figure appeared standing by the window. It was an old man (Astagfirallah, i thought he was Allah (SWT)), he had a golden light around him and appeared quite intellectual and knowledgeable. We started talking and i told him \"Its Lailatul Qadr.\" He replied by saying, \"That is not important. You are following Shaitan, SO you are going to Hell.\" I was so heartbroken... I started telling him, \"That can't be, its Lailatul Qadr. He said \"That doesn't matter....\" And then i awoke from my dream.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou should ignore the dream as it has no significance.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
