  "question": "Islam is a relatively new religion. What religion did Muslim practice before Muhammed?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIslam is a relatively new religion.  What religion did Muslim practice before Muhammed?  Why did the prophecies prior to Muhammed become obsolete?\n\nAs a man who was raised Catholic in the US and seeing the turmoil that is happening in the middle east, I have these questions.\n\nI am in love with a Muslim woman raised in Lebanon but cannot marry her as a Catholic.  I want to learn the good about Muslim but I have questions before I can convert.\n\nPlease resond.   Thank you.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nIslam is not new. Every heavenly religion was Islam and every prophet was a Muslim including Easa (AS) (Jesus). The laws of Islam changed according to times through revelation. Christianity is based on the false concept of Jesus being crucified. The religion of Easa (AS) was Islam. The same is true with all the prophets of Allah. Every prophet predicted the coming of the final prophet Muhammad (SAW). Open Deuteronomy 18-18 and read that with an open mind. Moses was told “I will raise them a prophet from amongst their brethren like unto thee” ponder on “like unto thee” who is like Moses, Jesus or Muhammad. Jesus and Moses were both Jesus and prophets. That is also true for many other prophets. It is not a special feature of Jesus.\n\n \n\nConsider the following similarities between Moses (AS) and Muhammad (SAW) \n\n \n\nMoses had a mother and father like Muhammad. Jesus did not have a father. It was not like Moses.\n\n \n\nMoses and Muhammad had a normal birth. Jesus had a miraculous birth. Jesus is not like Moses.\n\n \n\nMoses and Muhammad married and had children. Jesus did not marry. He is not like Moses.\n\n \n\nMoses and Muhammad were generally accepted by their people. Jesus was rejected by the Jews from then till today. Jesus is therefore not like Moses.\n\n \n\nMoses and Muhammad came with new sets of rules. Jesus assured his people that he is not an imposter and conveys the religion of the past. (Matthews 5-17-18) Jesus is again not like Moses.\n\n \n\nMoses and Muhammad died natural deaths. Jesus according to Christians was killed, so he was not like Moses.\n\n \n\nMoses and Muhammad are buried in the earth. Jesus is in heaven.\n\n \n\nIt is clear from all these that the verse referred to in Deuteronomy 18-18, is Muhammad (SAW). If you are honest and sincere you will embrace Islam upon understanding this.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
