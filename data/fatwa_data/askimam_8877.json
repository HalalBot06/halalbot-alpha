  "question": "Masjid al Aqsa or Dome of the rock?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) My understanding is that the Al-Aqsa Masjid is where our Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) led all the other prophets in prayer during the Isra (night journey). Could you confirm if this is correct or is not known where exactly within the Al Haram Al Sharif this prayer took place. I am aware that the Meraj took place in the Dome of the Rock.\n\n2) The Al Haram Al Sharif is one of three places where a muslim should set off in there lifetime to offer prayer, however which masjid is the prayer offered in; Al Aqsa Masjid or the Dome of the Rock or is praying in either Masjid as equal?. (As praying in the Al Haram Al Sharif is equivalant to offering 1000 prayers).\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) made Israa from Makkah to Masjidul Aqsaa (in Jerusalem). Masjidul Aqsaa was build by Suleiman (Alayhis salaam). The Dome of the Rock is situated further in front of the Masjidul Aqsaa. (Tareekh Baitul Maqdis Page 414, Maariful Qur?aan Vol.5 Page.421-431, Tafser Ibn Katheer (Matbooah Darus Sabooni, Cairo) Vol.2 Page.354)\n\n2. The virtue of performing salaah in the Masjidul Aqsaa in the Hadeeth refers to the entire Al-Quds. Therefore, if a person performs salaah in the Dome of the Rock and he intends the Masjidul Aqsaa, he will also receive the virtues of performing his salaah in the Masjidul Aqsaa itself. (Tareekh Baitul Maqdis Page.152)\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf"
