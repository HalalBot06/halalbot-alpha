  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nthe verse of holy Quran3:90 speaks about.. people who leave islam after accepting &then  incerase in diss belief there is no repentence.. for them. And at anothere place in quran Allah ( SwT) speaks about people who are muslim then becomes Kafir.. again muslim .. again Kafir..& then increase in dissbelief..even for them is no repentence..Please tell me whats difference in 1st case(quran3:90) & 2nd case.. of people..?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAllah Ta'ala mentions in the Quran:\n\nVerily, those who disbelieve after believing, then increase in their disbelief, their repentance shall never be accepted. These are indeed the ones gone astray.\"\n(3:90)\n\n\"Durru Al-Manthoor\" reports that Hasan (Radiyallahu Anhu) stated that this verse refers to the Jews and the Christians who do not accept Islam until their dying moments, when their acceptance is futile. Repentance shall not be accepted at the time of death.\n\nIn the second ayah, Allah Ta'ala mentions:\n\n\"Verily those who believe, then disbelieve, then believe, then disbelieve and increase in disbelief, it does not behove Allah Ta'ala to forgive them, nor to guide them to the right path.\"\n(4:137)\n\nCertain commentators mention that this verse refers to the Jews (not the Christians). They believed, then succumbed to the worship of the calf. Then they repented, but later disbelieved in Isa (Alayhis Salaam). Thereafter, they excelled in their disbelief until they knowingly rejected the final prophet, Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam).\n\n(Anwar Al-Bayan, Vol. 2, P. 198-199, 592-593, Zam  Zam Publishers)\n(Tafsir Al-Fakhr al-Razi, Vol. 4, P. 143-146, Vol. 6, P. 79, Dar Al-Fikr)\n(Tafsir Ruh Al-Ma'ani, Vol. 2, P. 209-210, Vol. 3, P. 173-174, Dar Al-Kutub al-A'lamiyya)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
