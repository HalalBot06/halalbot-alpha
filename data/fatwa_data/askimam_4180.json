  "question": "Please advise if I will get the same Sawaab for praying at a Musallah, as in a Masjid for under the following conditions:",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe Tablighi Jamaat is NOT allowed to give Bayaan, or have Mashwarah or Taleem, or stay overnite, at the local Masjid. So, they went out and rented a small apartment kind of place, where they conduct these activities. The 5 daily prayers take place (sometimes Dhuhr and Asr do not take place if nobody shows up) here. All Tablighi Jamaat activities are arranged from here, including Gasht, etc. In terms of people attending, the number attending at the Masjid, is 5 to 10 times greater than at this Musallah. I am confused, that if I pray at the Musallah, I will be losing out on the greater Sawaab.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs long as the Imaam of the Musjid has correct beliefs and performs the Salaat correctly, it will be more rewarding to perform Salaat in the Musjid.\n\nIt is also permissible to perform Salaat in the Musallah, although, the reward will be less.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
