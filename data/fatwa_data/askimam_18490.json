  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. Can a Sunni woman marry an Ahmadiya (Qadiyani) man?\n\n2. What if a Sunni woman has married an Ahmadiya (Qadiyani) man. What is the ruling and what she has to do to get back to the fold of Islam?\n\nPlease advice on this two questions as I would like to help a Sunni woman to correct and be in the right path, the path of Allah subhan-O-Taala.\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh  \n\n \n\nAccording to Shariah, it is not permissible for a Muslim woman to marry a man from the Ahmadi sect. She should try and get out of the marriage immediately and severe relationship with this man. Although she has entered into a marriage with a non Muslim, she has not lost her Imaan. She should make Tawbah and regret over her wrongdoing and resolve to follow the Laws of Allah and the Sunnah of Muhammed (Sallalaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
