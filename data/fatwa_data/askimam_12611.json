  "question": "Is it permissible to destroy plants in someone else's property if it helps you reach the masjid quicker?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nFor about five years now, I have been using a path to the masjid between a cut fence and a building. Recently, a lot of weeds have grown in this area and it is very hard to travel through it. It takes much longer for me to get to the masjid now and I am often late. Is it permissible for me to put chemicals in the soil to destroy those plants?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible to enter a private property or make a pathway without the express or indicative consent of the owner.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
