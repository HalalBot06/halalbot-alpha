  "question": "From my childhood, I've been seeing my parents and grandparents recite Surah Yaseen 3 times, on the 15th evening of Shaâ€™baan for the following benefits:",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1st time to be blessed with health, 2nd time to be blessed with abundance of Rizq, and 3rd time to be protected from all ?Balaa? (evils?), for the whole year - I?m assuming until the next 15th of Sha?baan. Is the above action in line with our Deen? If so, kindly provide the supporting evidence, as I get lot of mixed responses from lot of people.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe practice of reciting 'Yaaseen' three times on the 15 Sha'baan has no\nbasis in Shari'ah.\n\nThe consistent practice of reciting 'Yaaseen' is Bid'at which is a major\nsin. The practice must be discontinued. Bid'at invokes the anger of Allah Ta\n'ala, thus, defeating the purpose of reciting 'Yaaseen' - good health,\nBarakah in sustenance and removing evils.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
