What was the policy of Rasulullah in this subject.Expecting your reply. May Allah accept your service. Jazakallahu Hairan. Assalamu Alaikum\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat %DAmar (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) said that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'When your womenfolk request permission of you to attend the Masjid at night, grant them permission.' (Sahih Bukhari vol. 1 p. 119, Chapter on women coming out to the Masjid).%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the light of this Hadith, Imaam Maalik (Rahmatullaahi %C1layhi) said, 'This Hadith and other similar ones (wherein permission is granted to women to attend the Masjid) apply to old women.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllamah Khirmani (Rahmatullaahi %C1layhi) says that permission for ladies attending the Masjid is applicable to the night time as stated in this Hadith. And that permission is in the absence of Fitnah or mischief against women or by women. During the lifetime of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) the absence of mischief was dominant.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllama Alayni (RA) says, 'Verily, during our age mischeif and evil deeds are rife. (Footnote of Bukhari Shareef vol. 1 p. 119 Pakistani print). %0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat %C1aisha (Radhiallaahu %C1nha) narrates that if Nabi (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) knew what the women are doing he would have prevented them from the Masjid just as the women of Bani Israaeel were prevented.' (Bukhari vol. 1 p. 120)%0D%0A%0D%0AUnder this Hadith, Imaam Taymi says that this Hadith contains substantiation for the view that 'it is not proper for women to emerge (from their homes) to go to the Masjids when mischief becomes rife.'
