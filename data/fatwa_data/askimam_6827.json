  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have some muslim friends. Although they do not practice Islam. For examples, some of them eat food that is not halal and some have friends that are boys and they spend time with them. When I am with my friends and see that they are not following Islam, I really feel sad and I pray for them of Guidance. My faith increases Alhumdulillah and I thank Allah for giving me knowledge of Islam and showing me the right path. I wanted to know what I should do with these friends? Should I stay their friends and try to explain them about Islam (because I have already tried but they don't listen and I fear that if I keep on saying about Islam they might go against it even more) so sometimes I don't say anything and just pray for them. Please advice me what I should do about being staying friends with them and how should I act or advice them? Jazakallah Khairun\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nEmploy your discretion. If you are confident that your relationship with them and your constant advice to them will eventually dissuade them from their evil habits, then you may continue with your relationship with them. However, continue advising them with tact and wisdom.\n\nOn the other hand, if you feel that you may be inclined to evil deeds because of their company, you should refrain from joining them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
