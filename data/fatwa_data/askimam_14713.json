  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) Do you get the same amount of blessing walking or driving to the mosque, because if you walk you use energy, if you drive you spent money for the sake of Allah.\n\n2) I made intention of praying 4 rakats but in the middle i changed it to 2 rakats is this acceptable or makrooh?\n\n3) I hear stories where disbelievers make dua ( I understand if people do not believe in Allah why would they make dua, but for example in jammat they said a man made dua to produce so much Muslim blood it would reach the neck of his horse etc, ) and it is accepted, so because Allah said he will give the disbelievrs there rewards in this life, is Allah more likely to accept duas from non muslims than muslims in this life?\n\n4) I prayed Isha namazz but then somebody wanted to go mosque so i went with them and praued Isha again but with the intention of praying the Isha for a missed prayer (I am msking up missed salat Qadhaa) is this OK or not allowed?\n\n5) If you are doing a bad deed could you tell whether it was shaytaan or your nafs?\n\n6) Allah gave the \"reigns\" of Prophet Soloman (AS) to shaytaan meaning shaytaan was in control in whatever bad happened to the prophet, is it possible for shaytaan to make dua to Allah to control or let bad things happen to us?\n\n7) The hadeeth says shaking hands and giving salam forgives minor sins, but i just say salam mainly because in todays society people are reluctant to shake hands when they do not know you, so if i just say salam do i get halve reward? Do my sins get forgiven?\n\n8) My family is very divided (All muslims) but every year my mother does a Christmas dinner (Halal) should i go with intention of keeping close bonds with family or should not go at all?\n\n9) How do other people from different religions feel spirtual? For example when we pray tobah we cry because of the guilt and acknowldegemnt of Allah, but other religions such as Christains feel that same feeling so a christain sinner will break down and cry and then will feel spirtual and be a born again christian etc, how is this possible, is it there confusement or shaytaan etc?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram Brother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\n \n\nThe general principle is a person is rewarded according to his sacrifice.  Walking to the Musjid as well as driving are both sacrifices.  The issue of which one of the two is a greater sacrifice and yields greater reward depends on the condition of an individual.  For a poor person monetary sacrificed will be more rewarding and for a wealthy person, physical sacrifice will be more rewarding.  \n\n \n\nIt was correct to terminate the salaah after rakaats (Halabi Kabir)\n\nAllah Ta’ala listens to the Duas of all, Muslims and non-Muslims. It is upon Allah to accept or reject any Dua.  The dua of a Muslim is never in vain.  Allah either grants the believer whatever he asks for or grants him something better or stores the reward of that Dua for him in the hereafter.  A Kafir is deprived of such an honour. \n\n    4.   The Esha salaah in the Musjid will be nafl. It is not correct to perform a Qadha Esha salaah.\n\nThis very question is dictated by the Nafs. Furthermore, Shaytaan tries and makes an effort to lead a person astray but finally a person following his Nafs will commit the sin. \n\nAllah Ta’ala did not give any control to Shaytaan against Suleman (A.S.)\n\nThe saying of salaam and shaking the hands are two different actions and deeds. A person is rewarded for saying salaam but minor sins are forgiven by shaking the hands.\n\nTo maintain family ties is fardh. Islam has thaught us how to maintain family ties.  You do not have to do anything un-Islamic to fulfil this obligation. You should communicate with family members in other ways and maintain ties That will be more appreciated.\n\nThe criteria of determining truth not feeling guilty and breaking down. That is human and natural.  All human beings experience that. The issue is of what we do is correct and accepted by Allah or not. A person with wrong belief may cry whole life, yet his crying will be in vain as his belief, and faith is wrong. Allah says “And whosoever seeks a religion/path besides Islam, it will never be accepted from him.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\nThe guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\nEducation and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\nIslam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\nWhen one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\nMuslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\nWe have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\nIf you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\nIf that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\nRasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit”.\n\n \n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
