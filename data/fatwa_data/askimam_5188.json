  "question": "Wastage of water?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nUsually here in canada, The tap water that we do ablution with is cold when initially turned on. So to avoid doing wudhu with very cold water, I have to let some water flow before the warm water from the geezer reaches the tap. Now I have realized that this is wastage of water which is not allowed in Islam. So am I commiting a sin by waiting for warm water to reach the taps, during which cold water is wasted down the drain? We also have to keep in mind that the water is very cold that leads us to chances of getting ill because of the cold weather. Please help\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSince the water allowed to run down the drain is actually done to allow warm water to come through, it would not constitute wastage. However, since water is an invaluable blessing, we suggest you allow the water to run into a container and then use this cold water elsewhere, in the garden, for example. and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Muhammad Kadwa FATWA DEPT.
