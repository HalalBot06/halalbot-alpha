  "question": "contradiction in the qur'aan ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDo these passages of the Quran not contradict each other :\n\nThose who believe [in the Koran] and those who follow the Jewish [Scriptures] and the Christians and the Sabians, any who believe in Allah and the last days, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve (Surat Al-Baqarah 2:62).\n\nand\n\nThe Jews call Uzair a son of Allah, and the Christians call Christ the son of Allah. That is a saying from their mouth; [in this] they but imitate what the infidels (literal translation) of old used to say. Allah's curse be on them: how they are deluded away from the truth (Surat Al-Tawbah 9:30).\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the first verse, Allah mentioned four categories of people; a) Those who believe, b) Those who follow the Jewish scriptures, c) The Christians, and d) The Sabians.\n\nFrom amongst these people, whoever will bring Imaan on Allah and the last day and who will do actions of righteousness, they shall have their reward by their Lord and they will not fear nor shall they grieve. This Aayat is with reference to the people of the previous nations, irrespective of whichever category they fall under, they will have to bring Imaan on Allah and the last day. The verse should not be misunderstood to mean that the people of Imaan, Jews, Christians and Sabinas will be rewarded by their Lord. To attain this reward, the condition of bringing Imaan on Allah and the last day will have to be fulfilled.\n\nIn the second verse, Allah mentions the reason why the Jews and the Christians were despised and accursed. The Jews claimed that Uzayr is the son of Allah and the Christians claim that Eesa (alayhimus salaam)is the son of Allah. Allah is One, Alone, Has no partner nor children. In the Qur’aan, He has clearly declared, ‘they have not been commanded but to worship one diety.’ (Bayyina Aayat5)\n\nIn another verse, Allah mentions, ‘Had Allah willed to take for Himself a son, He could have chosen whom He pleased out of those from whom He created, but glory be to Him, He is above such things, He is Allah, the One, the Powerful.’ (Zumar Aayat4)\n\nTherefore, it is clearly evident from the abovementioned verse that the Jews and Christians were accursed because they ascribed partners unto Allah. To ascribe partners with Allah is Shirk and an unforgivable sin.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
