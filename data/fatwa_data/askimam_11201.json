  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf a male and female like eachother and they have no any other illegal relation between them but they just exchange islamic E_mails is it also sin? plz clearify\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for writing to the institute regarding emails between male%2Ffemale.%0D%0A%0D%0ASister, look at it this way. Shaitaan and our nafs are our biggest challenge and enemies. The principle we have to look towards is the one which clearly tells us to avoid sin. In this case, avoid anything which brings one near to zina. The initial intention may be a good one. However, what guarantees do we have against our nafs or shaitaan taking over? Although we may start off with deeni activity, the nafs may lead one to advance to a level least intended or planned for. Many pious persons have been led down that road by shaitaan and they have unfortunately lost their way.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllow me to suggest that you introduce her%2Fhim to a learned elder in the community, be it an a'lim%2Fa'limah whatever the case may be. You could also suggest websites, bookshops and libraries and leave the person to do their own investigating and learning with the help of these sources.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best.%0D%0A%0D%0A1Social department%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
