  "question": "A building that was used as a bar is on sale. I wish to buy and re-sell it. However, I am sure that I will only be able to re-sell it to some-one who will open another bar in its place. May I do so?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala says, 'And do not assist in sin and transgression.' (Maaidah Aayat2)\n\nSince in this situation, you are sure that the building will be for a bar which is a den of vice, evil and Haraam, it will not be permissible to get involved in such a transaction.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
