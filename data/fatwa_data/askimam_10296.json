  "question": "Can you tell me the meaning and also if its OK to keep the name Laila for my daughter?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI've been told that it means 'dark' and also that it was the name of a drunken sahabiya, can you confirm if this is true please? Can you also tell me if its recommended to keep this name or not. Jazakallah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nLaylaa was the name of numerous Sahabiyaat, in fact is has been mentioned that Laylaa the wife of Amir ibn Rabee'ah was the first woman, together with Ummu Salamah, to make Hijra to both Abbysinia and Madinah.\n\nLaylaa was also the name of the Daughter of Hazrat Uthman ibn Affan (Radhiallahu Anhu).\n\nBearing all this in mind, it would be perfectly permissible to name one's daughter Laylaa. Laylaa does not mean dark and it is not the name of a drunken Sahabiyah, Allah forbid. (Al-Isaabah, Al-Istiaab, Lisaanul Arab, Al-Qamoos)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
