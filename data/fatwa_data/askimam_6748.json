  "question": "1.If conditions weren't met with,during Iddath after talaaq,can this be repeated? 2.I have received a proposal to be a second wife.What are the conditions that i should know about?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy husband issued 3 talaaqs in one sitting 2 yrs ago.I was very traumatised about this especially as it was during a petty argument and he still wanted to maintain ties.Due to my weakness, i had relations with him on a few occasions during the iddath period ONLY.I deeply regret this and need to know what has to be done to undo this wrong deed.Do i have to serve iddath again?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If your husband issued you three divorces, the Nikah was severed permanently. It was Haraam (strictly prohibited) for you to have any relationship with him thereafter. You should make Tawbah (repent) to Allah for that wrong. Your Iddat is completed and you do not have to repeat your Iddat.\n\n2. In a polygamous marriage, the husband must be financially stable to maintain equality between his wives.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
