  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissible for a muslim to play in the NHL (National Hockey League).\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is not permissible for a Muslim to take part in the NHL (National Hockey League). In doing so, one is forced to compromise on many Islamic injunctions and values. Instead one may utilize this time more constructively and fruitfully in doing something that will earn you benefit and reward in the Court of Allah. Allah has sent us into this world to worship and obey Him. Allah states in Surah Mu’min “Do you think that I have crated you for entertainment?”.  \n\nThe tricks and ploy of Shaytaan is to decorate amusement and entertainment activities and deceive us to deem them worthwhile and constructive. Do not become misguided by these decorative activities. Channel your energies and vigor in acquiring Deeni knowledge or something that would benefit you in this world and the Hereafter.\n\nMay Allah guide you and assist you and make you an asset for the Ummah, Ameen.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
