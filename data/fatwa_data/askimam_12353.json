  "question": "Please correct my understanding that Christianity blames Hawwa a.s., solely for forcing Adam a.s. to commit the sin, and according to Islam both Adam a.s. and Hawwa a.s. were equally responsible.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn light of the above, please describe the authenticity of the following Ahadith: Volume 4, Book 55, Number 547: Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, \"But for the Israelis, meat would not decay and but for Eve, wives would never betray their husbands.\" Volume 4, Book 55, Number 611: Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, \"Were it not for Bani Israel, meat would not decay; and were it not for Eve, no woman would ever betray her husband.\" If, authentic, please explain in detail.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn Surah A'raaf Allah S.W.T. clearly explains what transpired between Iblees, Hawwa (A.S) and Adam (A.S.), \"And O Adam! Reside you and your spouse in paradise, and then eat from wherever you two wish, and do not draw near this tree, lest you become of the evil-doers.\" Then the Shaitaan whispered (misleading ideas) to the two so that he may expose to them their modesty which was unnoticed to each other, and he said: \"Your Sustainer forbids you from this tree, lest you become angels or you become permanent dwellers (of paradise).\" And he swore to them, that: \"Feel assured I am a well-wisher to you.\" So, seductively he devised the fall of the two. Then when they tasted of the tree, their shame exposed to each other, and they began affixing the leaves of paradise on themselves. And their Sustainer called out to them: \"Did I not forbid you from this tree of yours and say to you that: \"Indeed Shaitaan is your manifest enemy?\" They said: \"O our Sustainer! We have wronged ourselves; and if Thou do not forgive us and show mercy on us, indeed we shall be ruined.\" Allah said: \"Go down, you will remain enemies to each other; and for you there will be a place of settlement in the earth and enjoyment up to some time.\" Allah said: \"In it will you live, and in it will you die, and from it will you be brought forth.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AAccording to Islam both Hazrat Adam (A.S.) and Hawwa (A.S.) were deceived by Shaitaan into eating from the forbidden tree. It is incorrect to blame Hazrat Hawwa (A.S.) solely for the error caused. She did however encourage Hazrat Adam (A.S.) to eat from the tree assuming Iblees to be a true well-wisher to them. It is for this reason Nabi (S.A.W.) mentioned: \"..and had it not been for Hawwa women would not betray their husbands.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AOn the commentary of this Hadith the reputable scholar Allamah Ibni Hajar Al-'Asqalani states that: \"Hawwa (A.S.) was mesmerized by the false promises and embellishments of Shaitaan, as a result she encouraged Adam (A.S.) to partake from the forbidden tree.\" The Khiyaanah (betrayal) which Nabi (S.A.W.) speaks of in the Hadith is not referring to acts such as adultery, etc. Instead it is regarding a Khiyaanah of a much lesser degree e.g. the wife, due to her weak understanding, encourages the husband to do something of which the consequences are detrimental.
