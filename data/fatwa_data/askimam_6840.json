  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) When washing hands, is there any particular sequence. My friend keeps insisting that it should be right, right, right and then left, left, left. While I?m used to right,left right,left and right,left. 2) While washing face, am I required to say ?Ash hadu Alla Ilaha ??(2nd Kalima)? 3) While in Jumuah Khutbah or any Bayaan, under what condition Wudhu breaks a) Nodding off while leaning on wall or anything b) Nodding off without leaning on anything c) Talking d) Answering a Cell phone 4) While in Salaat, if the person feels that he is going to pass wind, should he break the Salaat or should finish if he can control?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In Wudhu, the right hand should be washed thrice. Thereafter, the left hand thrice.\n\n2. Before commencing with the Wudhu, you should recite Bismillah and when you complete you should recite, ?Ash-hadu anlaailaaha illallaah?.\n\n3. Sleep itself doesn?t break the Wudhu but the passing of wind breaks Wudhu. So, if a person falls into such a sleep that his rear part is not on the ground, then his Wudhu breaks. Also, if a person leans on something that if it is removed, he will fall, then too his Wudhu will break. Talking or answering a cell will not break Wudhu.\n\n4. If by not passing wind, his concentration in Salaat gets affected, then he should break his Wudhu and repeat the Salaat. However, if the time is short, he should complete the Salaat.
