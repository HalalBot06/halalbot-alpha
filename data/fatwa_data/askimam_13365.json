  "question": "I don't know what is sufi. Also please tell me what",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy freind said that hidayat is a favor of Allah Ta'la,and so on.  He also told me that Hadhrat Abul Hasan\nNadvi is a sufi, and I should be careful with sufis.I don't know what is sufi.  Also please tell me what\nis sufism?  Because in my classes whenever they talk about Islam, they talk about sufism.  They say that\nIslam has a mystic segment.  And when they look at me, I don't know anything about Islam as a sufi religion.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIslam promotes Tazkiyah - the cleaning or purification of the heart of all forms of spiritual filth that may impede ones spiritual progress and closer proximity to Allah. Now, some people realize that achieving this goal - i.e. spiritual purification - can only be gained by staying aloof from society and adhering to other stringent regulations. Such people are generally referred to as Sufis. The branch they are involved with is referred to Sufism. As far as Sufism  is concerned, it is a branch of Islam that deals in spiritual elevation and this is also a primary objective of Islam. In short, Sufism is a branch of Deen (Islam). However, over the years, a number of un-Islamic practices have seeped into this branch. Hence, the un-Islamic practices of some of these 'Sufis' cannot be condoned.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
