  "question": "About Jannah and the rewards for the believers. In Jannah, do ALL the inhabitants of Jannah have infinite rewards?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn Jannah, do ALL the inhabitants of Jannah have infinite rewards? The reason i ask this is because we know there are different different heavens, and some believers will undoubtedly have more rewards than others. If everyone had infinite rewards, then everyone would have equal rewards (since one infinity cannot be more than another infinity....infinity means endless). But, we know that some will have more than others, so does this mean that the rewards for the believers, in Jannah, will be finite?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe reward of every dweller of Jannah will certainly be infinite. However, that does not mean that every dweller?s rewards will be equal. The rewards will differ only in Awsaaf (qualities) and not in infinity.\n\nEquality in infinity is not inconsistent with difference in quality.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
