  "question": "A person has disability in his leg (metal fitted leg). He can walk well.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nA person has disability in his leg (metall fitted leg). He can walk well. Due to his disability, usally when he getup from sajda, he move one step front and then come back to the line. Does his salat is correct or not (consider his disability)? If not correct, can he sit in the chair and make Isharah only for Sajda? If yes how he should do Isharah? Jazakallahu Kahran.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle it is Makrooh to move unnecessarily in Salaah. If a Musalli (one performing Salaah) is disabled, etc. and is forced to make certain movements he/she will be excused. The Salaah will not be rendered Makrooh.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nFor-Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nChecked and Approved: Moulana Emraan Vawda"
