  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe power of du?aa is mentioned in many Ahaadith. Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] said in one Hadith, ?If anything could change Taqdeer (fate), it would be du?aa.?\n\nThe meaning of du?aa increasing the lifespan could refer to Allah adding Barakah (blessings) in one?s life, whereby he could achieve sometime which requires a long life in a very short lifespan. There are many such examples of Ulama who live very short lives but left behind a marvellous example.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
