  "question": "What are the teaching/hadith about putting flowers on a grave? Should one do that or should one rather use the money and give to the poor/needy.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI just need to be clarify about the role of flowers on a grave. My gran passed on and the family are all going crazy when it comes to her grave..Thanks Salaams Houmayrah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo place flowers on a grave has no basis in Shari'ah. That is the practise\nof non-Muslims to express grief at the death of a person.\n\nThe practise should be shunned. One should do pious deeds that will be of\nbenefit to the deceased, for example, reciting the Qur'aan, giving charity,\netc. on behalf of the deceased. Placing flowers on the grave does not\nbenefit the deceased in any way. It is a waste of money. Rather, that money\nbe given to the poor and needy as charity on behalf of the deceased. Insha\nAllah, the deceased will benefit from that immersely.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
