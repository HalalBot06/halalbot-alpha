  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nif you are about to read namaaz and you have'nt done azaan is the namaaz kabool.\n\nAlso do u have to do takbeer before namaaz, if u have'nt done it is the namaaz kabool.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe Adhaan and Iqaamat should be given before the Salaat and should not be omitted intentionally. However, if the Salaat is performed without them forgetfully or mistakenly, the Salaat is valid. This applies to Fardh Salaats only.
