  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is narrated from Hadhrat Abu Zarr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Three groups of people are such that Allah will not talk to them on the day of Qiyaamat nor will he look to them, nor will he purify them and for them is severe punishment?. Hadhrat Abu Dharr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) says, ?Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said this three times. %0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Dharr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) said, ?May they be losers. Who are they O Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).? %0D%0A%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?He who wears his pants below his ankles. The one who boasts of that good which he did for a person and that person who sells his goods with false oaths.? (Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn this Hadith, firstly, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) speaks about those people who wear their pants below their ankles out of pride. This is a very grave sin. What could be worse than Allah Ta?ala not speaking to a person, not even looking at him with mercy and dooming him to a painful punishment. %0D%0A%0D%0AFurthermore, it is narrated from Hadhrat Abdullah ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu). He says Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?That part below the ankles which is covered by the pants will be in the fire of hell. Nowadays, when you remind a person to raise his pants above his ankles. He says, ?The Hadith only mentions it in regards to those people who do it out of pride. This is quite a widespread misconception which is dealt with in the following Hadith:%0D%0A%0D%0ASayyiduna Jaabir ibn Saleem (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Be careful with regards to dragging your clothes (below the ankles), for verily it is from the acts of pride.? (Sunan Abu Dawud)%0D%0A%0D%0AHere, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) explains to us that the act of letting the pants go below the ankles is in itself an act of pride. (See Fathul Baari vol.10 pg.210)%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd as for Salaat in this condition, Sayyiduna ibn Mas?ood (Radhiallaahu Anhu) is reported to have said that such a person is out of the protection of Allah Ta?ala. (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta?ala save us all, Aameen"
