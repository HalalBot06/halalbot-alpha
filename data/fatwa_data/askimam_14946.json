  "question": "Taqdeer",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nRespected Ulama, I have read your response that “Taqdeer refers to the absolute knowledge of Allah Ta'ala of everything even prior to its existence. Since the knowledge of Allah Ta'ala is perfect, everything will take place exactly according to his knowledge, but in the case of our deeds it is through the choice of every individual.”\n\nI know in general we believe in fate and that we have a choice. But I also thought that we have to believe that good and bad fate is from Allah. So in that case, is our choice free and unlimited, or is it also according to the will of Allah. Please clarify this for me. Jazak Allah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThere are two issues in taqdeer: \n\nKhalq (to create)\nKasb (to earn)\n\nAllah is the Khaliq (creator) of all things good and bad. It is clear from this that good and bad being attributed to Allah. Human beings have full  and complete choice in choosing either good and bad.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
