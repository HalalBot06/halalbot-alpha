  "question": "Pictures not framed, maghrib 3 rakat prayer.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have read other questions and answers in this site regarding pictures. I was wondering If I am allowed to keep my baby pictures that I have not hanged up but kept in an albumb? I am also unsure about Fard Magrib 3 rakat prayer. I have heard two things- The first 2 rakat are just like the first two in 4rakat prayer then in... 3rd rakat - Just fatiha and the other thing I've heard is Fatiha & surah and some kind of dua. (note: I don't know any dua's so I just say \"Alham do lillah hilla-thee At Amana wa saquana waja 'alana minal Muslimeen\") which one is correct? And I've also heard about dua kunoot. Is it nessecary to memorize it? How do I memorize it - i do not know how to read arabic.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\n1. Pictures can only be taken in situations that are necessary, e.g.\npassport, id document, etc. But to take pictures just for the sake of it, is\nnot allowed.\n\n\n2. In the Maghrib Salaat, you recite Surah Faatiha and any Surah in the\nfirst two Rakaats and in the 3rd Rakaat, you recite only Surah Faatiha. If\nyou cannot read Arabic, you may get the Qunoot translated and then learn it.\nIt is also recommended that you start learning to read the language of the\nQur'aan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
