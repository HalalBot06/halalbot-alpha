  "answer": "QUESTION\ni read quaraan, but without any guidance but i dont know whether i am reading it correctly or not. what should i do\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn Islam, it is compulsory upon every person to seek that amount of knowledge through which he will be able to carry out his acts of Ibaadah (worship). Hadhrat Anas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has stated, ?To seek knowledge is Fardh and compulsory upon every Muslim.? (Mishkaat)\n\nIt is incorrect to perform any act of worship while not knowing it?s rules and regulations. Alhamdulillah, in today?s times, there are many Ulama and books available to guide us so that we may perform our Ibaadat correctly. There are also many books available on how to recite the Qur?aan correctly. One should, therefore, study those books first, so that one is able to recite the Qur?aan correctly. By doing this, Insha Allah, one will attain double reward, one for reciting the Qur?aan and the other for making an effort to recite it correctly.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nQari Ismail Abdul-Aziz\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN QUR?A"
