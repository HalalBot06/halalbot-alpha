JazakAllah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMarriage is a major step in life. You should exercise extreme caution in\nproceeding towards marriage.\n\nYour happiness and grief depends on the type of person you marry. The choice\nof a marriage partner requires skills, wisdom and experience. For that, you\nshould consult with your parents. Their guidance motivated by love for you\nand experience of life cannot be taken for granted. You should confide in\nthem by being clear and transparent. Wait for their response and take the\nmatter up from there.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
