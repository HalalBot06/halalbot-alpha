Giving divorce in state of her  menstruation cycle divorce  is effective? Will it  count as her first iddat period ? For example husband give the divorce at evening but cycle already start at morning?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1) Whenever any issue of Shari'ah and in particular a case of divorce is being presented for a ruling, one must fear Allah Ta'ala and present the case with full honesty and truthfulness. Allah Ta'ala knows all our intentions and what is in our hearts. Allah Ta'ala says:\n\nإن الله عليم بذات الصدور\n\n\"Surely, Allah is All-Aware of what lies in the hearts.\" (31:23)\n\nIf the facts of a divorce case are distorted then the fatwa will be according to the facts presented. However, the fatwa will not make haraam to halaal. It would remain haraam and the man and woman would be with each other illegally.\n\nIn principle, three divorces is considered to be talaaq mughalazah (a permanently irrevocable divorce). However, if the husband repeated one statement three times for emphasis on the one divorce, then his honesty in the matter is solely between him and Allah Ta'ala and the talaaq will be regarded as one.\n\nIf emphasis was not the intention of repeating the statements three times, then it will be regarded as talaaq mughalazah.   \n\n2) It is prohibited for a husband to divorce his wife while she is menstruating. However, if divorce is still given in this state, it will be valid. The iddah would start after her next period commences and after three full menstrual cycles the iddah would be complete.\n\n كرر لفظ الطلاق وقع الكل ، وإن نوى التأكيد دين .\n\n(Darrul Mukhtar, Vol. 3, P. 293, HM Saeed Company)\n\nرجل قال لإمرأته: أنت طالق ، أنت طالق ، أنت طالق ، فقال: عنيت بالأولى الطلاق ، و بالثانية والثالثة إفهامها ، صدق ديانةً .\n\n(Fatawa Alamgiree, Vol. 1, P. 355-356, Rashidiyya)\n\nوإذا طلق الرجل امرأته في حالة الحيض وقع الطلاق لأن النهي عنه لمعنى في غيره وهو ما ذكرناه فلا ينعدم مشروعيته\n\n(Al-Hidaya, Vol. 2, P. 357, Multan)\n\nثم البدعة في الوقت يختلف فيها المدخول بها وغير المدخول بها ؛ فيكره أن يطلق المدخول بها في حالة الحيض\n\n(Badai' Al-Sanai', Vol. 4, P. 205-206, Beirut)\n(Fatawa Mahmudiyya, Vol. 12, P. 185-187, P. 461-462, Faruqiyya) \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
