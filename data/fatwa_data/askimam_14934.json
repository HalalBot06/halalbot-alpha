  "question": "What is the ruling if semen does come into contact with the bedding?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf i had sex with my husband but no semen came into contact with the bed, do i still have to wash out the bedding? Does the bed now become napaak, if i didn't wash out the bedding, and everytime we sleep on it we have to make ghusal? What is the ruling if semen does come into contact with the bedding?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf the bed did not get soiled with semen, the bed will be paak (pure). If the bed got soiled with semen, the soiled portion of the bed must be washed.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
