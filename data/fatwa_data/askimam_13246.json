Kindly advice. please.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe lady with whom these acts were done should inform her husband as to what transpired. If her husband casts her claims aside and does not believe her, then she should continue living with him and not ponder any further in that regard. If, however, the husband believes her and is confident that she is speaking the truth, then it is imperative upon him to divorce her or verbally inform her that he has left her. If the husband does not terminate the Nikah, the wife will not be sinful and the children will be legitimate.
