  "question": "Regrading taraweeh qazaa",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nwhen making qazaa for taraweeh, you are allowed to make the salaat in 2 rakaats or in 4 rakaats. So if you choose to make up the salaah in 4 rakaats, do you recite aloud in the 3rd and fourth rakaats, and do u recite a surah after fatiha?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTaraweeh Salaat is performed only in the month of Ramadhaan. Taraweeh Salaat\nmust be preceded by Esha Salaat. There is no Qadhaa for Taraweeh Salaat.\n\nIf one missed Taraweeh Salaat of any one night, one cannot make up for the\nmissed Taraweeh. The person should make Tawbah (repent) to Allah Ta'ala for\nthat. If one missed Taraweeh Salaat with Jamaat (congregation), the person\nshould performed the Taraweeh of that night individually.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
