  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni want to know is it permissible to check about what ur husband doing like checking about history in net,or checking messages ofmobile ,with the intention to stop if he sees porn,,,\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAllah Ta’ala states in the Holy Quran:\n\n“O you who believe!  Avoid much suspicion; indeed some suspicions are sins.  And spy not, neither backbite one another...” [Surah Hujuraat, Ayah 12]\n\nNarrated Abu Hurairah RadiyAllahu anhu: Allah’s Messenger Sallallahu alayhi wasallam said, “Beware of suspicion, for suspicion is the worst of false tales; and do not look for other’s faults, and do not do spying on one another, and do not practice Najsh* and do not be jealous of one another and do not hate one another, and do not desert (stop talking to) one another.  And O Allah’s worshipers! Be brothers!” [Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 8, Kitabul-Adab, Hadith No. 6066]\n\n*Najsh means to offer a high price for something in order to allure another customer who is interested in the thing.\n\nNarrated Hudhaifah RadiyAllahu anhu: I heard the Prophet Sallallahu alayhi wasallam saying, “A Qattat* will not enter Paradise.” [Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 8, Kitabul Adab, Babu maa yukrah minan-Nameemah, Hadith No.6056]\n\n*A Qattat is a person who conveys disagreeable, false information from one person to another with the intention of causing harm and enmity between them.\n\nAllah gives us advice when He says, “O you who believe! Refrain from excessive assumption.  Verily, some assumptions are a sin.”  Assumptions pave the way for many sins such as slander and backbiting.  When an assumption is allowed to develop, it leads to many evils and serious conflict between people.  An assumption is nothing more than a personal opinion which seldom proves to be true.  Allah Ta’ala declares in Surah Najm, “assumptions are absolutely useless against the truth.” [Surah 53, verse28]\n\nOne should always entertain good opinions of Muslims and regain from harbouring ill thoughts about any Muslim.  Rasulullah Sallallahu alayhi wasallam said, “Beware of suspicion because suspicion is the falsest of all statements.” [Mishkaat, pg.427]\n\nIt should be noted that when a person fears that another may cause harm to him and takes measures to avoid harm as a precaution, his attitude will not be regarded as a sinful assumption.  Simultaneously, he should not backbite the person, nor allow the assumption to escalate to the degree of conviction (i.e. he cannot be convinced that the person will really cause harm to him).\n\nHowever, if there is an apprehension that some member of the Muslim community may be harmed by some mischief-makers, it is permitted for others to spy to protect the innocent and peaceful people, and search furtively for the intentions and conspiracies of such people who are a danger to the society.\n\nEvery human being by nature has an instinct to dispute. This instinct becomes more manifest between the husband and wife, thus leading to marital disputes. *\n\nSimilar is your situation.  If you suspect that your husband may be doing sinful acts due to which you check history or messages, it will be permissible.  However, this assumption should not ‘convince’ you that he really is committing such acts.  Shaitaan puts these suspicions or assumptions in couples to cause problems, for the love between husband and wife is the biggest blow to Shaytaan. \n\nIt is imperative for Muslims to abstain from such places that will lead others to suspect him of evil.  Similarly, he should also abstain from all deeds and words that will also lead to such suspicions.  It is not appropriate for a Muslim to live under a cloud of suspicion. \n\nThe verse makes it clear that all types of opinions about others are not sinful because Allah says that “some assumptions are a sin.”  There are therefore also those ‘assumptions’ that are encouraged, e.g. having the good opinion about Allah that He is Most Merciful and Forgiving while also abstaining from sins.  It is also necessary for a Muslim to entertain a favourable opinion about fellow Muslims, especially about righteous Muslims.  Rasulullah Sallallahu alayhi wasallam said, “Good opinions are part of good worship.” [Mishkaat, Musnad Ahmad, Abu Dawud]\n\n[Hawalah: Maariful Quran, & Anwaarul Bayaan] \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
