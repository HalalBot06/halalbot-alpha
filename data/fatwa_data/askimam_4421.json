  "question": "When approaching ones wife is not Bismillah sufficient enough before becoming intimate?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf ones mother tongue isn?t Arabic then remembering such Duaa can be tricky & the act becomes more planned than spontaneous as you have to go to a book & read the Duaa. I read somewhere on your site that the shaytaan is still there after the initial Duaa as he tries to become involved at the moment of ejaculation. Is there no escape? If one has read Ayatul Kursi before going to bed & then becomes intimate in the night does that Angel go because of the shyness they have while the shayateen enter? This is quite distressing to know that these evil things are still present even after making Duaa. It almost puts one off the idea of reciprocation because no matter what you say or do there is always something watching & wanting to be involved! Seems nothing is sacred not even the privacy of two human beings in an act of love in Islam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf one does not know the specific dua before being intimate, he/she may\nrecite Bismillah before that in the mind.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
