  "answer": "QUESTION\nJazakallah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe have been informed by reliable authorities that this picture is not the\npicture of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)'s grave. The grave of Nabi\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is simple, covered with a green cloth similar\nto the pattern of the Kiswa. It is a simple stone without any turbans or\nsheets around it.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
