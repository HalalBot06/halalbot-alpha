  "answer": "QUESTION\nif the surah was long for example Tabaraka when she goes to bed? JazakumLLAHU khayran.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Haraam for a lady who is menstruating to recite the Qur'aan Shareef\nwith the intention of Tilaawat. However, she is only permitted to recite\nthose verses that contain the meanings of Du'aa (supplication) with the\nintention of making Du'aa, not with the intention of making Tilaawat\n(reciting) the Qur'aan.\n\nIn the example quoted, it will not be permissible to recite Surah Tabaarak\nsince it does not contain the meaning of Du'aa.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
