  "question": "can a person write deeni? this person not a alim and mufti",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nthis person not writing his own words printout other mufti's fatwa and making a book can this person by doing this he is bussy forgeting jamath time not going for 3days jamath in everymonth\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for a person to engage in any activity of Deen to the best of his ability. That includes compiling authentic Fatwas as well as going out in the path of Allah.\n\nIn principle, one should not regard a permissible act to be compulsory. That will be Bid'at. However, an individual should not be complacent in engaging Deeni activities with the excuse that it is not compulsory. Shaytaan whispers an individual points of justification to avoid doing good.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
