  "question": "Is money earned by arranging musical concerts halal or haram?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMany people say that this method of earning your living is not right. I can't understand this because even when Holy Prophet (P.B.U.H.) migrated to Madinah, he was welcomed by the people of Madinah by playing music and the people were dancing etc., etc.. Please tell me what does Quran says about this and whether it is mention in The Quran that music is haram or halal. Please also tell whether there is an hadith regarding this matter.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMusic is prohibited in the Shari?ah.\n\nIn view of the above, any income accrued from Haraam sources is also Haraam. Income by arranging musical concerts is also Haraam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
