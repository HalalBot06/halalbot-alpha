  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have been wanting to get a tattoo of the crescent moon and star, then found out it is against islam to get a tattoo. But what if the tattoo is religious? such as the one i am wanting to get, does make it a difference?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nTattooing in itself is prohibited even though the image is a religious one.\n\nRasulullah (S.A.W.) said, â€œAllah curses the one who performs the act of tattooing and the one who seeks tattooing. This was a common practice during the time of Jaahiliyyah (pre- Islamic era).\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
