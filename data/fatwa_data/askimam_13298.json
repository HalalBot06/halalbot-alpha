  "question": "I have few Credit cards and I am very care ful about not paying any interest",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have few Credit cards and I am very care ful about not paying any interest on that and make my full payments before due date.But it happened that I have my friend and he is in need of some money and he tried all his sources but unable to get hold of any loans and he even tried bank loans which charge him interest but he was unable to fulfill their criteria so he dint got any loan.As a last resort he asked me but as I am also financially not that healthy,I told him he can use my credit card and pay of the debts when ever it is possible by him and also he should take care of his own interest and I am not responsible for any thing in that as long he clears of his debts.So my question is what I did was permissible according to sahria as I my self is not paying any interest and just lending him the whole CC untill he pays of all his debts.Does this comes under the category of helping in doing haram or wrong? when I myself know that it is haram!...also what shud I do by the time I get your reply he already used my Credit card as his matter is very urgent.\n\nJazakallah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf you are aware that your friend will use your credit card and not make payment timeously, then you will be assisting your friend in an interest bearing loan which is a sin. If you will be paying his account timeously and your friend will pay you later interest free, then you will be rewarded.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
