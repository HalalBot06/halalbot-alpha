  "question": "question about women coverinig their faces ... What do we say to people who ask why didn’t our Prophet (S.A.W.) say this and why is this not written in the Holy Qur’an?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaikum, Respected Mufti Sahab. I understand why a woman should cover her face but I don?t know how I can explain it to others who disagree. I have read that Ibn ?Abbas (R.A.) described Jalbab as follows: ?Allah commanded Muslim women to pull this sheet on top of them to cover their bodies except one eye, when it is necessary for them to come out of their home.? What do we say to people who ask why didn?t our Prophet (S.A.W.) say this and why is this not written in the Holy Qur?an? Althought v. 59 of Surah Ahzab does state that a woman should cover herself, many people interpret it differently and say it is not necessary to cover the face. Is it necessary? I have read your answers to similar questions but how can we argue this point with people who say that it is not stated in the Holy Qur?an to cover the face? Jazakallah Khair. May Allah Reward you for your good work.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIs it necessary for a woman to cover her face in the presence of strangers%0D%0A(who are not her designated Mahaarim) according to Shari%E1h?%0D%0A%0D%0AThis question is answered in this article in the context of the claim that%0D%0Athe veil or Niqaab is primarily 'a social requirement and custom according%0D%0Ato the environment and custom and according to the environment and customs%0D%0Aof a particular country.' In endeavouring to answer the question, we will%0D%0Aconfine ourselves to a brief examination of the relevant Qur%E3nic verses.%0D%0A%0D%0ASurah An-Nur, Verses 30 and 31%0D%0A'And Say to the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at%0D%0Aforbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual%0D%0Aacts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent%0D%0A(like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one%0D%0Aeye or dress like veil, gloves, head-cover, apron), and to draw their veils%0D%0Aall over Juyubihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bossoms) and not%0D%0Ato reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or%0D%0Atheir husband's fathers, or their sons, or their husband's sons, or their%0D%0Abrothers or their brother's sons, or their sister's sons, or their (Muslim%0D%0Awomen) (i.e. sisters in Islam), or the (female) slaves whom their right%0D%0Ahands possess, or old male servants who lack vigour, or small children who%0D%0Ahave no sense of feminine sex. And let them not stamp their feet so as to%0D%0Areveal what they hide of their adornment. And all of you beg Allah to%0D%0Aforgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful'%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is apparent that upon a plain reading the purpose of the verse is to%0D%0Aeradicate promiscuity, fornication and adultery and all the preliminary%0D%0Asteps that lead directly to the commission of such shameful acts. The%0D%0Areferences to 'lowering their gaze', 'drawing their veils over their bosoms'%0D%0Aand 'striking their feet to draw attention' indicate that all acts or%0D%0Aomissions which, in the ordinary course leads directly to sexual promiscuity%0D%0Aand FITNAH are forbidden.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn order to totally eradicate sexual promiscuity and FITNAH, the verse goes%0D%0Aon to say that a woman is not permitted to display her beauty and charms%0D%0Aexcept in degrees to her husband, father and the other classes of person%0D%0Aspecified in the verse. The exempt class would constitute the MAHAARIM, and%0D%0Aany other would qualify as strangers or GHAIR MAHRAM. The principle fixed by%0D%0Athe verse is, therefore, that a woman cannot display her beauty to any male%0D%0Aperson other than the persons exempted by the verse. It goes without saying%0D%0Athat the face is the focal-point of a woman's beauty, and the main source of%0D%0Aattraction. Hence, the face of a woman cannot be displayed or shown to a%0D%0Astranger in normal circumstances whether in public or private according to%0D%0Athe general principle fixed by the verse as stated above. She is permitted%0D%0Ato display her beauty to the exempt class (the MAHAARIM) for obvious reasons%0D%0Aof close contact, and because of the considerably lesser danger of sexual%0D%0Apromiscuity and FITNAH within that class. (Zamakhshari)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Shari%E1h, however, is practical, dynamic and takes into account the real%0D%0Asituations of life. A woman may - in the case of genuine need - be forced to%0D%0Aexpose her face in the presence of strangers. For example, when she appears%0D%0Ain court to give witness, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is against this background that the preceding portion of the verse 'they%0D%0Ashould not display their beauty and charms except what must ordinarily%0D%0Aappear unavoidable' falls into proper perspective. The words 'Illaa maa%0D%0Adhahara min'haa' are in context an exception to the general rule, and cover%0D%0Athose cases of genuine need and necessity when a woman is forced to expose%0D%0Aher face in the presence of a stranger. That is how the great commentators%0D%0Aof the Noble Qur%E3n have interpreted the verse.%0D%0A%0D%0ATake the following two examples,%0D%0A'Women must not display any part of their beauty and charms to strangers%0D%0Aexcept what cannot possibly be concealed.' (Ibn Katheer)%0D%0A%0D%0A'Why is the woman permitted to display her external beauty and charms?%0D%0ABecause to conceal that would cause her inconvenience. A woman is forced to%0D%0Adeal in commodities with her own hands. She is compelled by genuine need to%0D%0Aexpose her face especially at the times of giving evidence, litigating in%0D%0Acourt and marriage. She is compelled to walk the streets and expose her%0D%0Afeet, especially poor women. This is the meaning of 'illaa maa dhahara min'%0D%0Ahaa' that is 'except what the situations of ordinary life compel her to%0D%0Aexpose'. (Zamakhshari)%0D%0A%0D%0AA further point is the interpretation of 'illaa maa dhahara min'haa' has%0D%0Abeen highlighted by the well known scholar, Moulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi (RA).%0D%0AHe states that the verb used is that of the first form 'dhahara' and not%0D%0A'adhhar' which (in fourth form) signifies a deliberate exposure or display.%0D%0AThe use of 'maa dhahara' indicates that the exposure of the face is confined%0D%0Ato need. (Imdaadul Fataawa vol. 4 p. 181)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt follows from the aforegoing that upon a proper interpretation of the%0D%0Averse the face and hands of a woman can only be exposed to strangers in a%0D%0Asituation of genuine need where concealment would cause her serious%0D%0Ainconvinience. However, genuine need is not open to wide interpretations.%0D%0A%0D%0ASURA AL-AHZAAB - VERSE 53%0D%0A'.And when you ask them for anything you want, ask them from behind a%0D%0Ascreen.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThe meaning of this verse is clear: the companions of the Holy Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) were ordered to communicate with the wives of%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) from behind a screen and not%0D%0Adirectly face to face. It is obvious that this instruction is not limited to%0D%0Athe wives of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaau %C1layhi Wasallam). The verse has%0D%0Ageneral application and the fact that the noble wives of Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) are specifically mentioned emphasises the%0D%0Aimportance of the subject matter. The distinguished jurist, Abubakar Jassas%0D%0A(RA) in his Ahkaamul Qur%E3n states:%0D%0A%0D%0A'This order, although revealed specifically in relation to the Holy Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) is general in application because we are%0D%0Aordered to follow him.' Similarly, the well known commentator of the Noble%0D%0AQur%E3n Imaam Qurtubi (RA) in his Al-Jamia li Ahkaamul Qur%E3n states:%0D%0A'All women are in effect covered by the terms of the verse which embraces%0D%0Athe Shar%E9e principle that the whole of a woman is '%C1wrah' (to be%0D%0Aconcealed) - her body and voice, as mentioned previously. It is not%0D%0Apermissible to expose those parts except in the case of need, such as the%0D%0Agiving of evidence.'%0D%0A%0D%0ASURAH AL-AHZAAB - VERSE 59%0D%0A'O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the%0D%0Abelievers to draw their cloaks (veils all over their bodies (i.e. screen%0D%0Athemselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way).'%0D%0A%0D%0AIn his commentary to this verse, Allama Abubakar Jassas (RA) states the%0D%0Afollowing:%0D%0A'This verse proves that a young woman is ordered to cover her face from%0D%0Astrangers, and to manifest SATR and modesty in public so that doubtful%0D%0Apeople may not be desirous of her.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is sufficient to quote the following authentic commentators in their%0D%0Ainterpretation of the verse:%0D%0A'They (women), shall cover their faces and bodies with their outer garment%0D%0Awhen they appear in public for a valid reason.'%0D%0A%0D%0A'They shall cover their faces and.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIbn %C1bbaas states that the Muslim women are ordered to cover their head and%0D%0Afaces with outer garments except for one eye.'%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta%E3la Knows Best.%0D%0A%0D%0AWas salaam%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
