  "question": "Is McDonalds fast food chain stores Halaal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf not, why not, and why do (some) then display Halaal certificates?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Jamiat has not certified any of McDonalds chain stores as Halaal. We\nsuggest every Muslim community establish a Halaal Department and\nexamine/supervise outlets claiming to be Halaal and avise their communities\naccordingly.\n\nThe outlets should be notified of the Halaal department and the recognition\nit has by the local community.\n\nAND ALLAH TA'ALA KNOWS BEST\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
