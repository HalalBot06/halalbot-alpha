  "question": "I would like to know how I should join the Jamaat of a Fard Salaat if it is in the Quada(sitting) position",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) After I make takbeer, should I fold my hands and then sit or 2) Should I say Takbeer and just drop my hands to the side and then sit?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf a person did not join the congregation in the beginning with the Imaam, and he joins later, then he should recite the Takbeer-e-Tahrima in the standing posture and join the Imaam. If the Imaam is in Qiyaam (standing posture), the follower will tie his hands and remain standing behind the Imaam. If the Imaam is in any other posture, the follower should join the Imaam immediately after saying ‘Allaahu Akbar’ and without tying the hands.\n\nThe underlying principle is the hands are tied if one is required to recite anything in the standing posture. When a person joins the Imaam late, he does not have to recite anything besides reciting ‘Allaahu Akbar’.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
