  "answer": "QUESTION\nMany times, you tell people things, which you yourself admit have no evidence to support them in the Shariah, but are based on what the Ulema have said, or the experience of pious people. Q1:Doesn't all this fall under the category of bid'ah? Q2 : Is it ok if i don't indulge in things, that have no support for them in the Shariah, even if it is recommended by Muslim scholars like yourself? Will i be sinful for abstaining from such things? I simply want to follow the Qur'an and Sunnah. Q3 : if my mother indulges in such practises, can i tell her not to involve me in them?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf one regards the practice of any person which is not supported or prohibited in the Qur?aan or Sunnah as compulsory in Shari?ah, then only will such a practice be Bid?at.\n\nIt is incorrect for any person to impose upon another such a practice. If he/she does so, it will be Bid?at. It is not compulsory to follow such an act/s.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
