  "question": "founders of Deobandi school like Maulana Qasim Nanotvi and others did not believe in Prophet Muhammad's (s.a.w) finality of prophethood",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI recently heard from a friend that founders of Deobandi school like Maulana Qasim Nanotvi and others did not believe in Prophet Muhammad's (s.a.w) finality of prophethood. I assume this is an accusation. However, I was quoted a couple of paragraphs from Maulana Nanotvi's writings that allude to the same. Please elaborate on this point if possible.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe accusation is absolutely false. It is a common practice of some people to pick and choose some statements of the Ulama of Deoband without presenting the context of the statements. Obviously, that will portray an incorrect meaning. Everything must be understood fully and contextually.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
