  "question": "When will the dowry be given to the wife, on first night, before first intercourse or after intercourse, or after divorce?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nCash dowry may be paid at any time.\n\nHowever, should the wife insist on payment before intercourse, she has the right to do so. She may even refuse the husband the right to have intercourse if he does not pay the cash dowry.\n\nIf it was mutually agreed to differ the payment of dowry, then it will only be due on the agreed date.\n\nIf divorce takes place and the dowry was not paid, it will have to be paid immediately.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
