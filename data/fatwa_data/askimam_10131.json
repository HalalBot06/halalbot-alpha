  "question": "I would like to know the meaning of my name. It is Mariyam Akhsheela, but everyone use to call me Afsheela. I have come to know from a site that because of this name:",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n?Although your first name of Afsheela has created an expressive, fun-loving nature, it has not produced the qualities necessary for a full and complete lifeThe most serious drawback of the influence of this name is in the strong emotional feelings that it produces, which are difficult to control and create lack of stability in your thinking or in your affairs. You would find it difficult to control your desires and could over-indulge in your pleasures.? Note: ?Our Philosophy is dedicated to the service of humanity through dissemination of the wisdom of life, a scientific, practical knowledge based upon definite divine laws clearly understandable and applicable, teaching the individual's relationship to the two basic laws of life -- mathematics and language -- and teaching how everyone can greatly benefit through this wisdom.? As on the site. Do I have to believe this. I have known that it should not be a practice of a good Muslim to believe in such things where people tend to tell the future. Is there any relationship between this and jinn. And how do they know to tell all what had happened in our lives as they had seen us doing so. I have sometimes had confusion in facing my friends asking them to avoid such beliefs but they come up with stories that had come to pass them sometimes by palmistry and face reading. Please let me have a very fine explanation so that I can make my faith stronger with Allah?s will. Wa alaikumusalaam varahmathullah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour name is Mariyam and it is a very beautiful name. It is the name of the Mother of Isa (AS) and an entire chapter in the Quran has been named after her. As for Akhsheela, we are unaware of its meaning.%0D%0A%0D%0AAll forms of fortune-telling. palmistry, astrology,magic etc are vehemently forbidden in the Hadith. They have been classified as those things that destroy a person, a person who indulges in them has been classified a kaafir, one who just asks about them has been said to be out of the fold of Islam if he believes in them, and his ibadat will not be accepted for 40 days if he doesn't even believe in it but enquired about it, he will not enter Jannah, etc. (At-Targheeb)%0D%0A%0D%0AThus you can understand how severe a matter this is, that the one who believes in it is classified a Kaafir!%0D%0A%0D%0AThe reason for it is clear, only Allah and Allah Alone has knowledge of the unseen and thinking that anyone besides Allah could have this knowledge is attributing a partner to Allah (Shirk) which is the highest of all crimes. %0D%0A%0D%0ASome of these people have links with the shaytaans, who go up to the sky and eavesdrop on the discussions of the angels. They then convey this info. to the magicians, witchdoctors etc. who take this one piece of true info. and mix it up with a 100 lies and tell it to their gullible customers. You will find a few things they say to turn out true, some times it is because of their links with an shaitan or sometimes just a lucky guess. They specialize in ambiguous answers which could mean anything and could be interpreted in a manner suitable to anyone. %0D%0A%0D%0AIf you value your imam, please keep your distance from these people and don't give any attention to what they say .%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
