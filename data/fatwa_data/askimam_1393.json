  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs i have a degree but in Islam it does not allow that for women but only for men,is it ok if i work in an environment where there are only women including non-muslim women as i know many organisations where only women work. As for coming out of the house,i have car so will drive there with two other women whom i know.I'm sure this is allowed for women?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer to 'When Women Emerge' at http://www.jamiat.org.za/isinfo/w_emerge.html\n\nHowever, if you have no source of income and are required to work, then you\nmay do so among females.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
