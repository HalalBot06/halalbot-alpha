  "question": "I have a Muslim friend that I think is against Islam, but I don't know how to tell her",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy friend is a practicing Muslim and she is conversing via email with a Muslim guy because they are both interested in getting married. Because my friends older siblings are not married yet, she doesn't think it would be appropriate to get engaged before her sisters do. The thing is that the emails have gotten more and more romantic where they are telling each other they love each other, etc. I am pretty sure this is wrong, but my friend is so happy she doesn't realize what she is doing. How do I explain to her this without her getting offended?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are two aspects here:\nOne is I'elaam (to inform) and the other is I'emaal (to make others\npractice). Informing is merely a means of making others practice. The\npurpose (to make others practice) should be placed first and then wisdom\nshould be applied in trying to achieve the purpose.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
