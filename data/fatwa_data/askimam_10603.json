  "question": "I want to make Nikah while I am studing in the college. How should I do it? How to convince my family and the family of daughter?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI need your help about some serious matter. while living in a secular western country and also as a young man, I have to face many temptations and trials. Almost everywhere, I see things that arouse my sexual passions whether it is in my college, bus or metro (subway) or anywhere else. As a Muslim, I know I must have to suppress these emotions but I, sometimes, really find it very hard to do so. if we have no means and resources to get married, what should we do? I, personally, feel that although I am a little mature, yet, I am still studying and have 5 years to complete my education. I have neither any means and resources, nor I know any good Muslim girl to whom I can marry. Although, I am living with my family right now, but there is something missing in my life. I want to get married as soon as possible regardless of the circumstances I am facing now adays.In canada, some people make \"Nikah\" while they are studing; the girl keeps living with her family and the boy with his family. But if I try to do the same, the main problem is to find the family who would agree to give their daughter in a way that she keeps residing with her family. How to insist the daughter's family? And before that, how to convince my own family? I am waiting for your reply impatiently. I hope that the answer will not only benefit me, but other young boys in Islam as well. May Allah Bless you and the Muslim Youth. Ahmed Khan.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou state that you are a young man and wish to marry due to being faced with many temptations. Your zeal to abstain from sin is encouraging. May Allah Ta?ala keep you steadfast, Aameen.\n\nRasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ?If you can marry, then do so and if you cannot marry then fast as that suppresses the desires.? While you make an effort to marry, we advise you control your passions and desires by keeping fast to the best of your ability. To abstain from avenues of sins and issues that enhance your passion is obviously necessary. You acknowledge being ?little mature?. Marriage is a major step in one?s life. It requires wisdom, experience and expediency to make an appropriate decision. For that, you should discuss with your seniors and request their guidance and assistance.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
