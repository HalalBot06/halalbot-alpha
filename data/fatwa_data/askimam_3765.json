  "question": "Do you have to raise your hand up to the level of your shoulders when you bow down for ruku and when you rise from ruku.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Majority Madhaahib (Shaaf'ee, Maaliki and Hanbaliy), one is required to make Raf-ul-Yadayn before going to Ruku and when coming up from Ruku.\n\nAccording to Imaam Abu Hanifa, there is no Raf-ul-Yadayn before and after Ruku. Both opinions are substantiated from Ahaadith. Based on the principle of Taqleed, every person should follow the ruling of his Madhab as our small drops of knowledge cannot be compared to the Imaam's oceans of knowledge. We do not have that qualification to judge which Imaam's Ijtihaad is correct or incorrect. Therefore, we should trust the Ijtihaad of any one Imaam we follow and practise upon his ruling.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
