  "question": "problem with keeping pants above the ankles",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI understand the importance of keeping the pants above the ankles. I also understand that one cannot claim that he has no pride and therefore it is okay for him to leave the ankles covered.\n\nHowever is there any dispensation if the person is very short and find its difficult to obtain any trousers which do not cover the ankles? He buys the shortest available leg length, and even tries to cut the bottom of the trousers off, but since he is very short, the trousers still cover the ankles. He wears three-quarter length shalwars at home/outside, but his profession demands that while at work, he must wear trousers. And he cannot find any trousers which leave his ankles uncovered.\n\nIs there any dispensation in this case? If not, what would your advice be?\n\nJazakamullah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nNabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] mentioned, ‘Don’t keep your garments below your ankles because this is an act of pride.’\n\nThere are numerous Ahaadith on this subject which emphasise the importance of keeping the garments above the ankles. It is possible for a person to get his trousers hemmed by a tailor in such a manner that it will be below the ankles without damaging the trousers.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
