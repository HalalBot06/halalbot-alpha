  "question": "i am engaged with my cousin since last 3 years,i use to meet him in this era,what is the kafarah f previous meeting in islam after marriage,we had not gone through intercouse yet.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nmy cousin and i come close but haven't have intercourse yet,our parents r delaying our nikkah 4 more 6or 7 months,what will b the kafarah of it,will ALLAH bless us if we gave the kafarah,we have stronge beleif on ALLAH but still we r human beigs,sins come in our mind,what to do...plz guide us.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis is the reason Islam has ordered the laws of Hijaab. We are humans and\nbecause of contact with the opposite sex, especially non-Mahrams, we get\ninto situations that lead us to sins.\n\nIt begins with a small sin and this leads on to bigger sins. Explain to your\ncousin that there is a need to abstain from sins and to exercise Hijaab.\nSituations can become worse and the Barkat of Allah Ta'ala can take us to\ntask whensoever he wishes. At the same time, advise parents in some\ndiplomatic way that the Nikah must not be delayed. It is advised that it\nwould be better to perform the Nikah and go to the husband's house at a\nlater time. In the interim, you and your husband can live as husband and\nwife but still stay with parents till all finances and houses facilities,\netc. are arranged.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
