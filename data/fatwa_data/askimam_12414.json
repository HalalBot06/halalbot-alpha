Fadhaa'il-e-A'maal is a book in which the author has mentioned such Ahaadith and stories which encourages and creates the interest to do righteous deeds within a person. Indeed there are some weak Ahaadith and stories in it, but the object with which these narrations and stories are mentioned in this book permits relating such narrations and stories. The author has also forwarded the reference for each of the narrations and stories and did not merely relate them by making them up. Whosoever has any kind of objection against these narrations and stories can look into them again and practice on that which he thinks is more correct and acceptable. The author cannot be termed guilty in this issue. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Ashraf%0D%0ADARUL IFTA ?
