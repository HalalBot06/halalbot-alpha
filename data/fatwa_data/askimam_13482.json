  "question": "So the Abubakr (RA) was more clever than the profet.Isn't he?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRecently I asked you a question about camparing cleverity and legerity of the profet and Abubakr (RA) in choosing the khalifa for himself.But you answered me and tried to express that Abubakr (RA) choosed Umar (RA) through some method of consultation.So look.My friend asked me:Abubakr (RA) did many works as he can to appoint the best person to be the leader of people.He asked many great of sahaba ,he made many mittings, he gathered people and spoke when he was ill extremely, he killed his valuable time to tell the people \"Umar (RA) is the best choice to ...\".But profet never did this.\nSo the Abubakr (RA) was more clever than the profet.Isn't he?\nHelp me.\nThanks.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere was no need for Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] to appoint Abu-Bakr al-Siddeeq [radhiallaahu anhu] as his Khalifa as Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] knew that will happen even without his express appointment, and this is exactly what happened. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Allah and the believers will reject anyone else but Abu Bakr.’ (Bukhari)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
