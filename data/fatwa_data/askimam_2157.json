  "question": "If a Haaji stays in Makkah Mukarramah for 15 days only including the fivedays of Hajj, will he be considered a Muqeem or Musaafir?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Haaji will be a Musaafir (Raddul Mukhtaar vol.1 pg.571; Kuwait). He\nwill have to make Qasr (perform two Rakaat Salaats in Dhuhr, Asr and Esha\nSalaats), if he performs it individually or behind a Musaafir Imaam. If the\nImaam is a Muqeem, the Haaji will follow the Imaam and perform complete\nSalaat.\n\nFrom: Al Mahmood 13 Q & A from the Darul Ifta\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
