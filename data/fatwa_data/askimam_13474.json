  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni have a question regarding ziyarat e rasul(saw). i have a book named ziyarat of rasul e pak during the wakeful state.It has many instances which tell how do different buzurgan e deen\nwere visited upon by the prophet(saw) and also the 4 caliphs of islam.then at times also by hazrat fatima(RA).The holy prophet(pub) visits the people sometimes in their dreams and at other times when one is awake..Once i was reading about a saint who kept on reading daroodsharif but failed see the messenger.After 12 years he tried to commit suicide and he tied himself to the tree.with a string.suddenly he saw rasullalah catching him by his waist thus blessing him a new life.This happened in alaam e bedari(in wakeful state). people like shaikh abdul  qadir jilani used to see the great messenger in front of him.communicating!Once a saint used to recite darood sharif 75 times a day and kept on seeing the blessed face of the holy prophet.Once there was another sanit whose father died when he was a kid.He and his mother used to boil the leaves and ate them in extreme poverty and never begged from anyone.Due to this pure food allah bleesd him to see the holy prophet in dreams often.there was once a saint who was blessed\nin such a way that he was wakened by the holy prophet at the night of shab e barat.and he witnessed the holy sight with his eyes.I wanted to know that why people now a days dont see the holy prophet in wakeful state but only in dreams.Is this due to lack of our imaan  now\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is possible that people do see the Holy Prophet (SAW) in a wakeful state in today’s times, but they do not relate this instantly. You will probably hear of this as time progress.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf\nDARUL IFTA – JAMEAH MAHMOODIYAH, SPRINGS\n\nJOINT PROJECT WITH DARUL IFTA, MADRASAH IN’AAMIYYAH, CAMPERDOWN"
