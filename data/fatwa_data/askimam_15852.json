  "question": "What if I were to die then what would happen if I am not able to completely cover all my previous prayers? Will I be punished in hell?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nsalaam.\n\nI would like to know one thing. For a few years perhaps 1, I missed my salat though I knew they are farz. But now i sincerely repend that. I am now offering qadhaa namaaz after every fardh namaz for the past 1 month or so.\n\nWhat if I were to die then what would happen if I am not able to completely cover all my previous prayers? Will I be punished in hell?\n\nAdditionally, I would like to know that how do I ask ur repentance. I used to indulge in almost all forms of sexual indecency knowingly. And this used to happen on a periodic basis after several repentances. But this time, I am very much sad about that and I have made a very solid repentance that never again will I ever take that path. Will ALLAH forgive me?..please do let me know as I am concerned.\n\nHope to hear from you soon,\n\nSalaamualaikum.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1. It is encouraging to note that you are making up (Qaza) for your missed salats. Make dua that Allah grant you long life to be able to fulfill all your missed salats, Aameen.\n\nYou should have a will and record your missed salats in the will. Make a bequest to pay fidya for your missed salats. The fidya for each missed salats is the value equivalent to sadaqatul fitr. You should adjust the note of missed salats in your will as you progress in fulfilling you qaza salats. If you pass away while making an effort in fulfilling your qaza salats and you have made a bequest to pay the fidya for the remaining missed salats from 1/3 of your estate after burial expenses and debts, then it is hoped that Allah will accept your efforts and forgive you, Inshallah.\n\n2. If you have made a firm and sincere intention never to commit those sins again and you are honestly remorseful, then Allah will forgive you. Allah is Rahman (Most Merciful). The sighs of a repenter is more beloved to Allah than a person praising Allah. Don’t despair. Focus on the mercy of Allah and fear Allah’s Azaab in commiting sins in future. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
