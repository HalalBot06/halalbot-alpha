  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am always getting confused with the musafir masalahs, I always travel from Jhb to Dbn, and stay close to a mosque, my stay is always less than 15 days so I am a musafir, when my family members who live in Dbn go for salaah I accompany them and perfom my Zuhr, Asr & Isha salaahs in full , Is this correct ? Should I rather stay at home and perform qasr of these\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf a Musaafir performs Salaat behind the Imaam in Dhuhr, Asr and Esha Salaats, the Musaafir will have to follow the Imaam and complete the full Salaat.\n\nIf you can perform Salaat with Jamaat, then you should do so. However, if you perform Salaat individually, then you will have to perform Qasr (two Rakaats) in Dhuhr, Asr and Esha Salaats.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
