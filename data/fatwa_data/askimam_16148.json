  "question": "They do Fateha on the food. Can we consume such food?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ncan   we eat    the food given by our neighbours. they do fateha  \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThere are two issues to this query\n\nEating the food\nAccepting the food\n\nAccording to Shariah, if the food is Halaal, it will be permissible to eat it. However, you state that your neighbors do Fatiha and distribute food on the occasion. In that case, it is best to abstain from eating the food as we do not know the intention of distributing the food. Sometimes food is distributed in the name of some pious person upon whom they rely to fulfill their needs (Al Ayazubillah).\n\nNeighbors have a right upon us. It is important to respect them and be kind to them. In order to maintain your relation with them, you could take the food and dispose of it in some other way. If you refuse to accept the food, it could create doubt in their minds and jeopardize your relation with your neighbor.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
