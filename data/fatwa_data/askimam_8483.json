If some of the syllabus remains uncovered without there being any negligence and wasting of time from your side, then your salary will not be Haraam. The topic should be explained in a moderate manner without too much or too little explanation. If you have experienced that, with a moderate amount of explanation, the time allotted is insufficient then an appeal should be made to the management to increase the time. %0D%0A%0D%0A2. If a topic is easy, the fundamentals of that topic should be explained and then the students can be advised to study further into it together with guiding them to the books pertaining to that topic. %0D%0A%0D%0A3. If looking at the girls does not create any sexual desires or there is no fear of such desires then you will be excused for looking at them only while explaining them the lessons. %0D%0A%0D%0A4. The responsibility of the teacher is to understand the lesson he is about to teach and then put it forward to the students in a simple and noted manner. If the students have any questions he should try to answer them. If after fulfilling this responsibility few of the students fail to understand then this will not become the cause of his salary being Haraam. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Ashraf%0D%0ADarul Ifta ?
