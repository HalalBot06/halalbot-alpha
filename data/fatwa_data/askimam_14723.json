  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalaam Aleiykum!\n\nI had fallen in love with a girl back home for 3years and had the sole intention of marriage but delayed as she has some problems in Imaan and was trying to change to be a better muslm, i encouraged her in every possible way but Shaytaan got the better of her and made her weak at heart therefore i became reluctant and decided to depart and for the sake of my Imaan i came to try my opportunity in another country to get rid of all the evils i may have been trapped together with her.I fnd myself still in love with her although we have less contact now and i still hope she may change with Allah SWT's will.Recently she contacted and told me that she is still in love with me although she says she has plans to get married with someone else of which i believe she is confused or one way she is trying to see if i am available or with other plans of marriage in my mind.I need help as i do not see myself falling in love with any other and i do not wish to impurify or abandon my good deeds as i lost once and do not intend to repeat the mistake again.I had done Istikaharah before and i got a feeling of getting engaged with her but made patience and everything went wrong after that and she turned to someone who was lost with the desires of this world.Kindly advice. \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram Brother / Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nAssalamu alaukum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh\n\n \n\nIf you love the girl, you should first clearify the doubts you have in your mind about her being in love with you.You Should relate to her how you think about her..Confession of love with you and that you feel she is also testing your love for her.Also clearify if she intends marrying someone else, why would she be interested in you.Therefore you should make Istikhara again and then decide.\n\n \n\nAnd Alah Ta’ala knows best.\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
