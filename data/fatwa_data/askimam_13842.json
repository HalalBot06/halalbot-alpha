  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni ask abt the problem of Geryan(drops)once by seeing or reading any extra ordinery thing there might be some drops comes out of semen..my question is that is due to this ghusal is farz or not..and if the gusal is not farz can we perform prayer after cleaning the dress..also tell the method of cleaning\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf semen is discharged out of passion while one is awake or asleep, Ghusl becomes Waajib (compulsory) irrespective of whether it is discharged by touching a person of the opposite sex, or by having any such thoughts or fantasies or by any other way â€“ in all cases Ghusl will be compulsory.\n\nIf the semen fell on the clothes, then they will have to be washed before performing Salaat in them. If the semen is dry, it can be purified by scrapping it off and rubbing it thoroughly. If it has not dried as yet, it will have to be washed until it is removed and no stain remains.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
