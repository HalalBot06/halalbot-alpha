  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI purchased a vehicle on a residual or lease option. I will return the car at the end of the lease term (4 more years). My current lease installment is R2800. For zakaat purposes should I deduct the entire lease liability or onlyÂ the installments due within 12 months?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nYou have mentioned in the query that you will have to return the car to the bank at the end of the lease period. Therefore, it will be as if though the bank is hiring the car to you. In this case, the amount due on you will not be regarded as a liability, but a mere rent that you are paying every month (or however the scheme demands). Now, when the amount will not be regarded as a liability, it will not be permissible to deduct any amount when calculating the zakaat.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
