  "question": "What to do if children are uncontrollable in a masjid or Islamic center?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat to do if children are uncontrollable in a masjid or Islamic center? In many masjids and Islamic centers now, people do not stop their children from running around, hitting, and misbehaving. If a place of worship is an Islamic center and not called a masjid, but there is an Imam there and salat, is it permissible for children to run around during salat or to play in such a place before or after salat? What can the Imam do? What if the Imam has tried having khutbah a couple of times, but the situation continues? Are we (the public) who go to the masjid allowed to stop the children if they misbehave or do we leave it to the parents only? The problem is the parents do not stop their children.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Imaam has all the rights to advise the parents of these ill-disciplined children. He should advise the parents not to bring these children to the Musjid. The ideal age of children who may be brought to the Musjid is 6 ? 7 years.\n\nThe children should be advised about the etiquette of the Musjid before they set off from home. Each parent should be responsible for his own child. However, if other children are misbehaving, one may stop them by employing affection and tact.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI"
