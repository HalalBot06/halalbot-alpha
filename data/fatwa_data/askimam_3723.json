  "question": "Are all of the prophecies of Muhammad (peace be upon him) in the Hadith Qudsi?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf they were directly revealed from Allah, wouldn?t they have been in the hadith Qudsi? Also, what do scholars think the reason for the Hadith Qudsi is i.e. aren?t they in fact Ayah that should have been written in the Qur?an?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAll the predictions of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) are not from Hadith-e-Qudsi. The difference between Hadith Qudsi and Qur'aan is of Ghayr Matloo (not recited) and Matloo (recited) respectively.\n\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was advised by Jibraaeel (Alayhis salaam) as to which revelation form part of the Qur'aan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
