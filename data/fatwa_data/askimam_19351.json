  "question": "I just want to ask that does it come in Haya to hide the news of a woman's pregnancy from na mehram people?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI just want to ask that does it come in Haya to hide the news of a woman's pregnancy from na mehram people? In my situation i hide the news as i have seen that my aalima teachers never let anyone know about their pregnancies until they get the baby. I did the same as long as i can hide. but after sometime i only told some women with the assurity that they won't tell their husbands or any other na mehram. But then few men came to my husband and started congratulating him by saying that we heard about your wife? which made my husband upset. ALso some men do discuss such things with other men about their wives pregnancy details like my wife is pregnant or this is her 1 trimester etc. Is it a right thing according to ISLAM? What sahabiyat used to do in such situation and what islam says? When we are not allowed to say Salam to a na mehram, when we are not allowed to discuss any other women infront of our husbands then how we can discuss such a thing infront of na mehrams which comes in haya . Why such an attitude is becoming so common in muslims? Please clarify me these things in the light of islam and correct me if i am wrong.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nModesty is an integral path of a persons faith.\n\n \n\nصحيح مسلم - عبد الباقي - (1 / 63)\n\nحدثنا عبيد الله بن سعيد وعبد بن حميد قالا حدثنا أبو عامر العقدي حدثنا سليمان بن بلال عن عبد الله بن دينار عن أبي صالح عن أبي هريرة عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال * الإيمان بضع وسبعون شعبة والحياء شعبة من الإيمان\n\n \n\nSayyindunāAbu Hurayrah (Radiyallāhu Ta`ālā`anhu) narrates that Nabi (Salallāhu `alayhi wasallam) mentioned: Īmān (faith) has seventy odd branches. Modesty is one branch of Īmān.\n\n \n\nصحيح مسلم - عبد الباقي - (1 / 64)\n\nحدثنا محمد بن المثنى ومحمد بن بشار واللفظ لابن المثنى قالا حدثنا محمد بن جعفر حدثنا شعبة عن قتادة قال سمعت أبا السوار يحدث أنه سمع عمران بن حصين يحدث عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم أنه قال * الحياء لا يأتي إلا بخير\n\nAnother narration mentions that Nabi (Salallāhu `alayhi wasallam) said: Modesty brings nothing but good.\n\nPregnancy is a bounty from Allāh Ta`ālā. To speak about the bounties of Allāh is encouraged.\n\n \n\nوأما بنعمة ربك فحدث (الضحى11)\n\nAnd about the bounty of your Lord, do talk. [93:11]\n\nTherefore, one may mention the news of conception to ones close relatives and friends in a modest way. There is no prohibition in shariah for that and neither is that against shame and modesty. There are incidents in which mention is made of the pregnancies of sahābiyyāt (Radiyallāhu Ta`ālā`anhunna). For example:\n\nNabi (Sallallāhu `alayhi wasallam) eldest daughter, SayyidatunāZaynab (Radiyallāhu Ta`ālā`anhā) during her hijrah was attacked which lead to the miscarriage of her chid and also to her demise. If mentioning the pregnancy of females were contrary to modest, such information should not have been recorded by our honourable scholars.\n\nIt is famously known that SayyidatunāAsmā’ bint Abi Bakr (Radiyallāhu Ta`ālāanha) made hijrah whilst she was pregnant. Had her pregnancy been concealed none should have known she was pregnant during her migration.\n\nSayyiduna `Imrān ibn Husayn narrates that a pregnant woman from the tribe of Juhaynah came to Nabi (Sallallāhu `alayhi wasallam) ...\n\nYes, one should con conceal the physical aspect of the pregnancy as much as possible by wearing lose clothes.\n\nReferences:\n\n \n\nAl Isābah\n\nAl Istī`āb\n\nAt Targhīb\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Ishaaq E.
