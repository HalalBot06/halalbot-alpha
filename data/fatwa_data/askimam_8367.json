  "question": "Presently my brothers are in banking profession too. Q1. Is the money halal now? Am I obliged to earn money while studying in Madressa or should I start earning after the completion of my studies?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy late father was a banker. Presently my brothers are in banking profession too. Lately I?ve joined madressa while quitting my job of teaching. Now I?m worried about the fund, which is utilized, at my home which is mainly interest and insurance (though my mother after knowing forbiddance of riba has invested money in buying houses and renting as well as invested in Islamic banks). Q1. Is the money halal now? Q2. Am I obliged to earn money while studying in Madressa or should I start earning after the completion of my studies. Q3. Is inheritance from such source is halal or not? Kindly reply soon I?m in a great mental agony.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If the wealth was purely from Haraam services and the real owners of the wealth are known, then it is necessary to give such wealth in charity. If the wealth has been mixed up, i.e. Halaal and Haraam then, the inheritors may inherit such wealth. However, it is best that they not use anything until they have discharged an exchange for an amount equivalent to the Haraam. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyah vol.11 pg.408)\n\n2. If you have somebody to look after your needs and the needs of your family through Halaal sources, or you have sufficient resources of your own at your disposal whilst you study, then earning money will not be an obligation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
