  "question": "is it sunnah to do musaafaha with two hands? give reference [hadith and name of book]",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah is reported to have said, ?The perfect way for one to greet is to shake hands.? (Mirqaat vol.8 pg.498)\n\nThis was the way of the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhu), greeted each other and shook hands. On returning from a journey, they used to embrace each other also. (Shu?bul Imaan; Bayhaqi)\n\nThis Sunnat of shaking hands should be encouraged as Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has stated that mutual greeting creates love and unity. It is clear that both hands should be used in hand shakes. Imam Bukhari has devoted whole chapter in his Sahih Bukhari on ?Chapter of Shaking hands with both hands.?\n\nHammaad ibn Zayd (Radhiallaahu Anhu) shook hands with ibn al-Mubaarak using both hands, then mentioned the Hadith of ibn Mas?ood (Radhiallaahu Anhu), ?Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) taught me the Tashahhud as he taught me a Sura from the Qur?aan while my hand was between his hands.?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai<"
