  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nwhat is the ruling of praying behind barelwi's?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf the Aqeedah (belief) of the Imaam is not that of the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaaâ€™ah, it will not be permissible to follow that Imam.\n\nIf the Imam has the belief that Rasulullah (Salalaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is Hazir (present everywhere) and Nazir (seeing everywhere) it will not be permissible to follow that Imam as these are Sole qualities of Allah Alone. None of the creation could possess these qualities.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
