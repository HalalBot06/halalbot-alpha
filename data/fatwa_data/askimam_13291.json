  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease provide the references from the Qur’an and Hadith, that directly prohibits a woman leading the Salaat.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nNabi (S.A.W.), while delivering a sermon, directly prohibited women from leading prayers, \"Behold! No women should lead a man in prayer.\" (Sunan-e-Ibne Majah)\n\nThe Qur’an speaks, \"And whatever the messenger assigns to you, you should accept, and whatever he forbids you from, you should refrain. And fear Allah, certainly Allah is severe in afflicting.\" (Surah Al-Hashar, Verse 7)\n\nAn Imam holds the position of a leader amongst the people. Women, however, have been banned from assuming the position of leadership, as emphasized by Rasoolullah (S.AW.), \"How can a people lead by a woman, ever prosper.\"\n\nThe Jurists have unanimously agreed that women are not allowed to lead the prayers.
