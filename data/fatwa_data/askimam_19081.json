  "question": "What is the sunnah method of marriage and what rituals should be abstained from? Also, how should I reply to people who say JazakAllah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1)     I will be getting married soon. I wanted to know what is the sunnah way to be adopted in marriage? What things are to be emphasized upon and what things should we abstain from? What actually is the Prophet’s sunnah and which rituals which people consider to be part of Deen should we abstain from?\n\n2)     Also how should I reply to one who says Jazakallah?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\n \n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\n1)     Nikah is considered an act of Ibadah and is a great sunnah of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasalaam). In order to attain full blessings and barakah from this great act, one should have the nikah ceremony in the closest way to the sunnah as possible. Firstly, one should conduct the nikah ceremony in the masjid, as Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasalaam) advised. It is unfortunate that nowadays many people choose to conduct the nikah in halls and fancy, expensive venues. Not only is this unnecessary but it is also extravagance, about which Allah Ta’ala states:\n\n“O children of Adam, take on your adornment at every mosque. Eat and drink and do not be extravagant. Surely, He does not like the extravagant.” (7:31)\n\nFurthermore, many times when these venues are used, there is plenty of unnecessary intermingling of the sexes, music, dancing etc. all of which are prohibited.\n\nAlso, many people include other celebrations in the time of weddings which have no basis in Shari’ah, such as the mehndi and other functions which are from other cultures. These events also include music, dancing etc. and must be avoided. For more information please refer to the following answer of Mufti Abu Yahya:\n\nhttp://askimam.org/fatwa/fatwa.php?askid=372cbb31454c71b78728df7a3642474c\n\n2)     The word JazakAllah is in essence a dua meaning “May Allah reward you”. When one gives this dua to you, respond by returning it back to them and saying “Wa Iyyak” (And to you as well) or once can say “Barak Allah” (May Allah bless you)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\n \n\nMuftī Asif Umar\n\nWashington, DC (USA)\n\n \n\nConcurred by:\n\nMuftī Abrar Mirza\n\nChicago, IL (USA)\n\n \n\n\nUnder the Supervision of Muftī Ebrahim Desai (South Africa)\n\n \n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER – AskImam.org questions\nAskImam.org answers issues pertaining to Sharī’ah.
