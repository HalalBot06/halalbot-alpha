  "question": "What is the punishment for drinking alcohol. Basically I have heard that if you drink alcohol your namaz will not be accepted for 40 days. It this true? and where is evidence of this?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt has been narrated by Hadhrat Abdullah ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that\nNabiy (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'An alcoholic's Salaat will not be\naccepted for forty days. If he repents, Allah will forgive him.' (Tirmidhi\nvol.2 pg.8)\n\nThe commentators have explained this Hadith as, 'Salaat will not be accepted\n', meaning he will not attain the sweetness of conversing with Allah.\nHowever, his obligation will be discharged. Another explanation is that his\nreward will not be like the reward of those who do not drink.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
