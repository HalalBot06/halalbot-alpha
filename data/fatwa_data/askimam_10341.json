  "question": "I have eaten unlawful food accidentally. What should i do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIt happened as i went to meet some friends of mine who are christians and hindus. They offered me a pizza to eat. I was alarmed that this food would be containing some haram meat and i asked them wheter it is halal or not. They said and assured me that it is only cheese and tomato pizza. I ate it then and even asked them where they bought it from with the intention that i would verify wheter it was halal or not. They gave me the dresciption of the pizza. However when i went to the shop i found that the same pizza contained Red Wine Vinegar. I really forgot to ask my friends on that ocassion about alchoal ingredients and think that it is really my fault and that i should have asked them about this as well. I really dont know what to do. I continue to ask ALLAH's forgiveness and request you to please do dua for me as well. Please tell me what should i do in this situation. I really really forgot about this alcohol ingredient and if i would have known i would have never eaten it.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is of paramount importance to exercise extreme precaution in matters of\nHalaal and Haraam. It is also not appropriate to rule any food as Halaal\nbased on the information of non-Muslims. Most non-Muslims do not understand\nthe complete concept of Halaal.\n\nYou should continue making Istighfaar (seek forgiveness) for consuming the\nHaraam pizza and exercise precaution in future.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
