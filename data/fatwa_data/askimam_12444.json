  "question": "How come ex-boss will come to know about his employeeâ€™s misdeeds in the Day of Judgment and will ask his rights from employee about this theft?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRefer to question # 12351, Can you please answer, what if ex-boss is not aware about this stealing, even though we consider this case as not fulfilling the rights of human being, How come ex-boss will come to know about his employee?s misdeeds in the Day of Judgment and will ask his rights from employee about this theft? As Allah SWT did not expose him here, will He SWT will expose him in the Day of Judgment even this guy is asking forgiveness from Allah. Please clarify?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe wealth of an individual is sacred. Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] announced during his Hajj, ?Behold, verily your blood, your wealth and your honour are sacred?.\n\nIf a person stole somebody?s wealth, he has violated the person?s sacred right which can be forgiven only by the person himself. The day of judgment is a day of justice. It will be unjust not to give anyone his due right due to him not knowing of his right. Allah is All-Forgiving. He is also al-Aadl (The Just One). It is possible for Allah to forgive and to do justice at the same time.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
