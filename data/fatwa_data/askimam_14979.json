  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. Allah says he wont push a person past there limits so why do people commit suicide or go insane?\n2. Is it makrooh to hold wind in namaaz?\n3. Allah says in times of problems turn to the Qur'an, does this mean read any chapter, or read a chapter that is similar to your problem?\n4. Can you explain the importance of the topi. I heard some brothers says sometimes Prophet Muhaummad (PBUH) prayed with nothing on his head dues to the heat, is this true or weak haddith?\n5. What is the most rewarding, Umra, dawwah to family or tabligh?\n6. As a mufti what do you do specifically in times of fitnah? I know you should do good ammals etc, but specifically what Qu'ran chapter do you read etc?\n7. If I learn surah Jospeh off by part will i learn the Qu'ran more easier? I hear this chapter once learnt will make the person remember the Qur'an much much more easier. Is there any other particular surahs which have this same beneift?\n8. I know you should take a bath on Friday but because I am busy in the morning is it OK to take a bath late Thursday or even midnight Thursday?\n9. I have finished my degree Alhumdulillah but still find it hard to get a job, is there any dua that i can make?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe choice to carry out any action is the prerogative of every individual. Allah has defined the path of good and bad in the Holy Quraan. Allah has also explained the repercussions for those who tread these paths. It is the choice of every individual to take upon himself/herself whichever path and bear the repercussions accordingly. One of the implications of treading the path of evil and bad is that, Allah will narrow the life of this world and thus make life difficult and miserable (Surah 20 Verse 124). Thereafter, one will become depressed, withdrawn from society and resort to suicide. The cause for the suicide was not that Allah had forced something upon an individual but that which his/her own hands have earned. If citizens of a country violate the laws of the country by causing blood shed and havoc, certainly one will not point fingers at the law-makers and criticize them; rather the actions of the citizens will be condemned. Surely Allah does not compel something out of ones reach; however, Allah cannot be responsible for the consequences of ones bad deeds.\nIt is Makrooh (reprehensible) to perform Salaah while having the urge to pass wind.\nThe Quraan provides solution to all problems. One should search for the solution to his/her difficulty by referring to the appropriate chapter or Surah of the Quraan and search for the solution. Care must be taken that if one is not well versant in the science of Tafseer, a reliable Alim should be consulted and his guidance taken on the matter.\n \n\nTOPEE (HEADGEAR)\n\n1. Hazrat Ibn Umar (Radiallahu Anhu) narrates that Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) used to wear a white topee\n\n (Tabrani)\n\n2. It is reported from Ibn Umar (Radiallahu Anhu) that Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) wore a white topee.\n\n (Mu'jamul Kabeer of Tabraani)\n\n3. It is reported from Ibn Umar (Radiallahu Anhu) that Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) wore a white topee. \n\n   (this Hadeeth is weak - Tazkiratul Maudu'aat pg. 155)\n\n4. Abu Sheikh reports from Ibn Abbas (Radiallahu Anhu) that Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) had three topees in his possesion.\n\n                                                                                                                                              (Bazlul Majhood vol.6 pg. 52)\n\n5. In \"Mukhtasar\", a description of Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam)'s three topees is found - one was such that on the inside it had a lining sewn with it. The second was made of the Hibarah Fabric and the third was the topee that covered the ears, which was generally worn on journeys and would sometimes be in front at Salah times.\n6. Hazrat Ayesha (Radiallahu Anha) narrates that Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) would wear a white topi which lay flat and compressed to his head.\n\n                   (Ibn 'Asaakir has reported this; however the Sanad (chain of narrators) is weak. (Faizul Qadeer vol. 5 pg. 246)\n\n7. Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasllam) has said that a Muhrim (person in Ihraam) must not wear a Kurta, turban, pants and a \"Burnus\" (specific type of Topee) (i.e. he will not wear these types of clothing).\n\n(Bukhaari Shareef vol.1 pg. 209, vol.2 pg. 864).\n\nIt is thus learnt that people were in the habit of wearing the topee in the time of Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam).\n\n8. The narration of Ibn Abbas (Radiallahu Anhu) has already been mentioned (refer to no. 29), the subject matter of which was that Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) would wear a topee under his turban and would sometimes wear only a topee (Ibn Asaakir etc. narrated this Hadith. The Sanad is weak).\n9. Hazrat Ayesha (Radiallahu Anha) narrates that Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) would wear a topee which covered his ears while on a journey and while at home he would wear a thin (i.e. Syrian style) topee. Abu Shaikh has narrated this Hadith. Iraaqi (R.A.) has written that of the Ahaadith dealing with the topee, this hadith is the most authentic and reliable. (Faizul Qadeer vol. 5 pg.  246). This Hadith has already passed under hadith no. 29.\n1O.Abu Kabsha Anmaan narrates that the Topee of the Sahaaba (Radiallahu Anhum) were spread out and flat.\n\n         (Tirmizi - this Hadith is weak pg. 308)\n\nHazrat Gangohi (R.A) explains the meaning of this narration that \"their complete heads were covered. The topees would not stand up but were flat and compressed\".\n\n                                                                                                                                    (Al-kaukabud Durrie vol.2 pg. 452)\n\nMention of the Topee of the Sahaaba-e-Kiraam and Taabi'een\n\n11. Zaid Ibn Jubair says that he saw Abdullah Ibn Zubair (Radiallahu Anhu) wearing a topee. (In the narration, the Arabic word \"Burtula\" appears which refers to a specific type of topee).\nHishaam Bin Urwa also says that he saw Ibn Zubair (Radiallahu Anhu) wearing a topee of thin material.\n\n12. Eesa Ibn Tahmaan says that he saw Anas lbn Malik (Radiallahu Anhu) wearing a topee. In the narration, the word \"Burnus\" comes which means a long hat. (In Bukhari too, the wearing of a topee by Anas (Radiallahu Anhu) is mentioned. vol. 2 pg. 863).\n\n13. The father of Ash'as reports that he saw Abu Musa Ash'ari (Radiallahu Anhu) coming out of the toilet. Abu Musa had on a Topee.\n\n14. Ismaaeel says that he saw Shuraih wearing a Topee.\n\n15. Abu Shihaab says. that he saw Sa'eed Ibn Jubair (Radiallahu Anhu) wearing a Topee. (both Shihaab and Ibn  Jubair are Tabi'ees). Ali Ibn Husain (i.e. Hazrat Zainul Aabideen), Ibrahim Nakh'ee and Dhahaak were all seen wearing Topees.\n\n(All these narrations are reported together with their Sanad in Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaiba vol.8 pg. 212/213/242)\n\nHazrat Ali (Radiallahu Anhu) was seen wearing a white Egyptian Topee.\n\n(Tabaqaat Ibn Sa'ad {Urdu} vol. 3 pg. 187)\n\nThe mention of the Topee of Abu lshaq Sabee Tabi'ee is found in Bukhari. (vol.1 pg.159).\nIbn Ul Arabi writes, \"The topee is amongst the clothing of the Ambiyaa and Pious ones. It protects the head and keeps the turban in place, which is Sunnah. The topee should sit on the head and should not be standing like a dome. Should anyone feel the necessity of making holes in the topee in order to keep the head cool and to let out steam, then this would be regarded as a means of treatment (i.e. this should not be done without necessity). (Faizul Qadeer vol.5 pg. 247)\n\n{taken from the article turban topee and kurta}\n\nIt is not appropriate to afford virtue to one action over the other. All three actions are equally important and meritorious. One will have to assess at each point what is the need of the moment and accordingly, one particular act will take precedence and virtue over the other. For example, if ones children are neglecting Salaah and neglecting their religious obligations, as a parent it will more important to encourage them to fulfill their Deeni obligations than go and remind others. Therefore, it is important to give all Deeni responsibilities its due rights and recognition and fulfill them in such a manner that no responsibility is neglected.\nHadhrat Mufti Ebrahim Saheb has prepared 10 points regarding what to do in times of hardship, please search them on our website at http://www.askimam.org/search/search.php\nAllah States in Surah Qamr “We have made the Quraan easy to memorize, is there anyone prepared to learn it”. Therefore, if you have made intention to memorize the Quraan and have dedicated your time towards committing it to memory, Allah will surely make it easy for you. We have not come across any authentic reference with regards to the memorizing of Surah Yusuf. One major factor that would contribute towards making your memorizing easier, is abstaining from all types of sin. Imam Shaafi (Rahimahullah) complained to his Ustaad, Imam Wakee (Rahimahullah) regarding his poor memory, he said “abandon every type of sin, for Ilm (knowledge) is a Noor (light) from Allah, and Allah does not endow a sinner with His Noor.\nIt is Sunnah to take a bath on Friday specifically for the Jumma Salaah. If is not possible for you to take a bath before Jumma Salaah, and make intention for a Jumma bath on Thursday night, you will receive the reward of having a fuifilled the Sunnah (Shaami Vol.1 Pg 169).\nYou may recite Allahumakfini Bi Halaalika an Haramika Wa Aghniny Bi Fadlika Amman Siwaak, as much as possible.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
