  "question": "Is there any option for a women who is feeding her infant child to leave fasts?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf a woman has an infant child of around 2 months who is totally dependant on mother's milk and if she fasts, it would be difficult for her as well as milk would be insufficient for the child which might be dangerous. In this case, i have heard that there is \"Rukhsat\" for the women from Fasting. Is it true? Is there any Kaffara for the month of Ramzan if she is unable to fast for some days or for the whole month? Kindly answer the question as soon as possible Jazak Allah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYes, she is given this concession to abstain from fasting if fasting is detrimental to her or to the baby.\n\nNo, there is no Kaffaarah in this case. She only has to observe Qadhaa for the missed fasts after Ramadhaan whenever she is able to.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
