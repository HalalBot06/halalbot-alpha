  "question": "Is it more or less virtuous to read Sunnat & Nafl salaah outside the 'Musjid' area in the mosque? As I observe many people purposefully go ousite the musjid area to perform sunnat & nafl salaah.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Ulama have mentioned that it is permissible to read the Sunnah and Nafl\nSalaats both in the Musjid and at home. The more virtuous of the two would\nbe that environment in which one is able to read the Salaat with more\nconcentration and devotion. (Ahsanul Fataawa vol.3 pg.487)\n\nBased on this, we understand that it is permissible to read the Sunnah and\nNafl Salaats both within the boundaries of the Musjid proper, or outside the\nboundaries. Preference should be given to that place wherein the person can\nachieve more concentration and devotion in his Salaats. That is left up to\neach individual.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
