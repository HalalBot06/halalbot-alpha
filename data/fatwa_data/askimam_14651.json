There is no point in getting angry with children when they are mischievous. They simply have to be controlled. However, if they do something wrong, foe example, speaking lies etc, then one should create an expression of anger in front of the child to discipline the child from bad and wrong habits.   \n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
