  "question": "With whatâ€™s happening in India, where innocent Muslims even children are being burnt alive, the question being asked by Muslims and non-Muslims alike is, why is Allah s.w.t. allowing this to happen?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThis is with reference to the massacre of Muslims in Gujarat last week (end of Feb ?02). Even though the Muslims may not be following their belief correctly, but at least they do not oppress people like others, so why is Allah s.w.t., being Ghafoor-ur-Raheem, and one who totally does NOT like oppression, allowing Muslims to be killed in the most unimaginable and horrific way possible? Please generate your response in detail, as this is impacting the thinking of huge number of Muslims and non_Muslims.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDifficulties do not always come about because of sin. If this was indeed the\ncase, the prophets would never have suffered any misfortune.\n\nSometimes, Allah Ta'ala inflicts minor calamities that prevent major\ncalamities. Sometimes, people are tested by Allah Ta'ala to ascertain their\ndegree of forbearance before Allah. Difficulties are also a cause for reward\nand elevation of one's status in the hereafter. Continue making Du'aa and\nbeg Allah's Aafiyat (security and safety from all form of misfortune).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
