  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Sahib, Assalaamu alaikum(w.r.w.b), I'm suffering from SINUS for the past one decade. I often (may be once in a month) get affected with cold and which cause head-ache and sometimes fever. Now my questions are, 1. Is there any domestic medicine according to hadeeth for SINUS? 2. Is there any domestic medicine for stopping the cold quickly? (my friend told me to drink ginger paste mixed with honey). 3. Whenever I get cold I have running nose (i.e. the cold runs like water from the nose). When I do salath with this the cold drops on my cloth and masjid carpets. Is it najis? Can I hold it by hand (using tissue or hand karchief) inside my salath?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. You should refer to a Hakeem who deals with natural medicines.\n\n2. The liquid substance coming out from your nose is not impure. You should adopt some means, for example, handkerchief, etc. to avoid the Masjid carpet from getting messed up.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
