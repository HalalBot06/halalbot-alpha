  "question": "Are humans capable of knowing who a Jinn is in this life? Do angels exist among us?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAre humans capable of knowing who a Jinn is in this life? Therefore, talking to one and the jinn aknowledges that he is a jinn. Same query for angels: do they exist among us, meaning, in the form of humans in society, but without humans knowing that they are indeed angels and not man?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAngels and Jinns can assume the form and shape of human beings. All human\nbeings do not recognise the angels and Jinns in the assumed form of human\nbeings.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
