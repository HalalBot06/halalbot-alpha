  "question": "What is the manner of the Prophet (SAW) according to authentic Hadith?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have been through the site and have not found anything describing the Prophet SAW prayer as described in the Sahih Books of Hadith. There is descriptions based on the Madhab. The Prophet SAW's command was to the effect Pray as you have seen me pray. I would like to know the authentic or proper way of prayer as the Madhabs was chosen centuries after Rasulullah SAW's demise. Please clarify. Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe different Madhaahib were not chosen after centuries.\n\nImaam Nu'man ibn Thaabit Abu Hanifa was a Taabi' and has seen at least four\nSahaabas, among them, one was Khaadim of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam), Hadhrat Anas ibn Maalik (Radhiallaahu Anhu).\n\nImam Maalik was a contemporary of Abu Hanifa. Imaam Muhammad ibn Idriss\nShaafi'i and Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal were also contemporaries and both\nbenefited from the students of Imaam Abu Hanifa. The procedure of the\nProphet's Salaat has been extensively researched by the four Imaams and have\nbeen substantiated by authentic Ahaadith.\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
