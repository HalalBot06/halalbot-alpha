  "question": "Is all forms of kissing allowed before marriage? And should you also perform Ghusal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nReading your site, it was said that a woman is allowed to give her husband pleasure with the use of her hand. Must she perform Ghusal once she has done this? Is all forms of kissing allowed before marriage? And should you also perform Ghusal?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not necessary for the wife to perform Ghusl.\n\nAll forms of kissing and contact with a woman before marriage is totally\nprohibited. One should exercise restraint. In an event where one has already\nmade a mistake then Tawbah should be made. However, Ghusl is not Waajib.\nWudhu or Ghusl is Mustahabb after committing a sin.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
