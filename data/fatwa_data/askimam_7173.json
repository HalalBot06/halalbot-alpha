  "question": "Can struggling for some kind of dunya affair like Basketball team be shirk?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAbout 3 years ago, Allah, through His infinite mercy, allowed me to revert to Islam. Before that, I was a basketball fanatic (you could say it was my dean). My whole life was a struggle revolving around preparing myself through any means of diet, exercise, and practice in order to make my high school team and eventually play for a college. I felt like it was my duty, like my purpose, and I loved the game with great enormity. However, ever since I have been blessed with Islam, I have felt this love, sense of purpose, and duty gradually tip scales to that of Allah. For about the last year I have been constantly debating with myself as to weather I should continue to give this kind of struggle to basketball, or if this is something reserved only for Allah. Finally, just a couple of weeks ago I went up to my coach and told him I can no longer play for the team because I felt that only Allah is deserving of any kind of struggle, and to continue to play for the team would be hypocritical of what my heart was leaning me towards. But I still feel like it is O.K., with the intention of halal recreation and exercise, to continue to play (not struggle) on my own time. By that knowledge which Allah has granted to you, do you feel I have made the right decision, or was this fanatical and excessive of me?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlhamdulillah, you have made the right decision. Previously, your whole life was focused upon a sport but now your focus is Allah and Islam. This is a very commendable decision. We recommend that you do not play for the team as this will, somewhere along the line, make you compromise your religious values.\n\nYou may engage in some other forms of physical exercises to keep physically fit.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
