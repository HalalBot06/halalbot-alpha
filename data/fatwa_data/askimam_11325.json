  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs this correct ALLAH (subhanahu wata'ala) fixed 5 things for all humans, which cannot be changed. that can be say it won't change even a person does any eefort or make any dua for it. and plz tell us what are these 5 things that cannot be changed.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTaqdeer refers to absolute and comprehensive knowledge of Allah. Whatever is in the knowledge of Allah regarding the future, that will never change as the knowledge of Allah is perfect and absolute.\n\nAs human being, we are instructed to make an effort in fulfilling the ordains of Allah. We are also instructed to make du?aa. Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] said, ?Du?aa is a weapon of a believer. If anything could change Taqdeer, it would be Du?aa.? Allah Ta?ala tells us of His absolute knowledge of five things in the Qur?aan ? The time of Qiyaamat, the coming of rain, knowledge of what is in the womb of a pregnant womb, what a person will earn tomorrow, where a person will die.\n\nThe absolute and complete details of these five are only known to Allah. Whatever is known of these five is not absolute and comprehensive.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
