  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)Why can one claim Unemployment benefit from a Kufr government? Claiming money which has not been earned, i.e. usury, is not permissible. What makes this claim of benefit permissible? Since it is unearned? (please explain)2)I have a picture in my house of the mosque (Holly Qibla) in Makkah, It has come to my attention, that in this picture there are (really small) people in the mosque praying namaz, doing tawaf, etc.. Is this picture permissible? My lack of knowledge has brought me to think NO, under the guidelines of a ?picture which contains a living soul? is forbidden. 3)All praise is due to Allah. My local mosque has many attendants for Jummah Salaat. My mosque holds two Jammats so that everyone has a chance to read. Is two Jammats allowed in one mosque, in the same prayer hall? And can this be done by the same Imam under any condition?4)Are we allowed to steal money? Or take out a loan with no intention to pay it back, if the money is for Jihad Fiza-bi-lillah (in the Cause for Allah)?5)I have a beard, and am in need of a job. I had an interview and was told that I can not keep my beard fist length, and was given a polite (but not justified) explanation. If I shorten my beard, inshallah it won?t interfere with my Imaan. Once the job is secure and I am pass my probation period, and have become permanent, I can grow it back fully, knowing that they can?t fire me for keeping a beard? Would this be OK? bare in mind my intentions are good and I am in need of work!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Usury is not simply \"money that has not been earned\", otherwise gifts,inheritance etc would all fall under usury. Our jurists have clearly defined interest based on Quran and Sunnah and this does not fall under this definition.The government offers unemployment benefits to its worthy citizens, thus it could be accepted and would be classified as a gift from them.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. If the people in the picture are so small that their faces and limbs cannot be discerned, then it would be permissible to keep such a picture.(Aap Ker Masail Vol.7 Pg.65)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. It is not correct to hold two jumu'ahs in one masjid. It the musjid does not have the capacity to accommodate all the musalleees, then alternative arrangements for Jumu'ah must be made. Jumu'ah salah can also be performed in a hall or on an open field etc. (Fatawa Rahimiyyah Vol.6 pg.117,118,119 -Jadeed, Fatawa Darul Ulum Vol.6 Pg.71 &105)%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Stealing or taking a loan without intending to repay it, is completely haram, regardless of the intention. %0D%0A%0D%0A5. It is not permissible to trim the beard less than a fist length, regardless of the reason and intention. Sustenance is from Allah Ta'ala and our success lies in pleasing him. How can one expect to get an increase in his sustenance by disobeying Allah? Any sustenance earned through His disobedience would be completely devoid of blessing. Place your trust in Allah and realise that this is a test from Allah to see whether I will be patient or whether I will follow the evil whisperings of Shaitaan and turn my back on the commandments of Allah. May Allah make it easy for you and give us all true tawakkul on him.Aameen%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
