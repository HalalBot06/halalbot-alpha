  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n\n\nFirstly,I want to know a good website address from where i can buy islamic books like'Mareful Quran' written in German.\nSecondly,  what rights a muslim woman has  on his husband's money?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nBookstores:\n\na)      Albalagh Bookstore:  http://www.albalagh.net/bookstore/\n\nb)      Al Madania Bookstor:  http://www.madania.org/bookshop.php\n\n \n\nUnfortunately “Ma’ariful Quraan” is not available in German. However, the English version which is available at these sites is in an easy English.\n\n \n\n \n\nIf the husband is sufficiently providing for his wife and minor children, then the wife does not have a right to use her husband’s money without his consent. If the husband is miserly and he does not sufficiently provide for his wife and minor children, then she has a right to use her husband’s money without his consent to fulfill her principle needs. She cannot take an amount more than her principle needs in order to fulfill her luxuries. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
