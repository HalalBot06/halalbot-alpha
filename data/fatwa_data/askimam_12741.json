  "question": "Is it allowed to drink beer without alcohol?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-wa-alykum 1.) Is it allowed to drink bier without alcohol? And what is about smoking? 2.)While doing Ghusul we have to Pour water three times over head, but here we have shower so do we must use a kind of jug, is this counting so important? 3.)How should I explain my nonmuslim friends that Why tattoo is haram in Islam?4.)Is it allowed to trim eyebrows on wedding day, just to attract newly-wed husband? Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Non-alcoholic beer has been proven to have small amounts of alcohol in it. Thus, it is not permissible to consume. It is Makrooh-e-Tahrimi to smoke.\n\n2. The counting applies to when one takes a bath with a jug, not when using the shower.\n\n3. Tattooes are Haraam because they are a disfiguring of the body that Allah has given us. The body we have is a trust from Allah and should be looked after. Tattoos disfigure the body and change in the way that Allah has created us.\n\n4. It is not permissible to trim the eyebrows even on the wedding day.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
