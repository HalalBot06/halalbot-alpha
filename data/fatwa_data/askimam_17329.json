  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuhu,\n\nMy wife was a Hindu and accepted Islam 4 years ago. Many years ago her father who is still a Hindu, had invested money in a Postal Service Scheme in her name and deposited Rs. 20,000. This money has now matured to the value of Rs. 80,000 and wants my wife to take the money. As per my contention this money is Haraam because of ineterest and refused to take the money in total. What do we do in this situation?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIn principle, it will be permissible for your wife her to accept the entire amount as it will be regarded as a gift to her from her father. Since the investment was carried out by a non Muslim, who is not obliged to adhere to the Furooa’at (Laws of Shariah other than Tawheed), there is no harm in accepting the money even though it has an interest component.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
