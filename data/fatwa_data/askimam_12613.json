  "question": "how many qurbani must b made after shaving head in hajj 1 or 2?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two types of animal sacrifices: a) Qurbaani and, b) Damm\n\nQurbaani is that sacrifice of an animal during Eid-ul-Adha. This is not related to Hajj. Qurbaani is compulsory upon every adult Muslim who has at least the possession of the Nisaab of Zakaat during the 10, 11, 12 of Dhul-Hijjah.\n\nDamm is a sacrifice related to Hajj. If a person performs Umra together with Hajj, whether in one Ihraam or separate Ihraams (Qiraan or Tamattu), then the Haji must sacrifice a goat, sheep or 1/7 share of a camel. This is known as Damm-e-Shukr. It is to thank Allah for the opportunity to perform Umrah together with Hajj.\n\nThere is another type of Damm known as Damm-e-Jinaayat. This is, when a person violates the laws of Ihraam, he has to pay a penalty by sacrificing a goat, sheep or 1/7 camel. At times, an entire camel has to be sacrificed depending on the nature of the violation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
