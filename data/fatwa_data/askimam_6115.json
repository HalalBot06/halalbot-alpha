  "question": "What is the basis of the Arab practice of men greeting each other by kissing on their cheeks? Can this be traced back to Nabi s.a.w.s.?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nUnfortunately, we are unable to trace a basis for the abovementioned\npractice.\n\nThe correct method of greeting is to make salaam and thereafter shake hands,\nand if someone was met after a long period of time, then Mu'aanaqah\n(embracing) should be made. This is what is authentically proven from\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and his companions (Radhiallaahu\nAnhum). (Refer to Majmauz zawaid vol.8 pg.37; Al-Adaab of Bayhaqi pg.181 and\nFathul Baatri vol.11 pg.70; Hadith No.:6266)\n\nFurthermore, to kiss one between his eyes or on his hands is also\nestablished to be part of the practice of our beloved Nabi (Sallallaahu\nAlayhi Wasallam) and his companions (Radhiallaahu Anhum)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
