  "question": "Does sleeping after fajr and asar weaken your memory ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe have not come across any narration to this effect.\n\nHowever, in the Ahaadith, we are informed that these two times are very\nblessed and should preferably be spent in the Dhikr of Allah Ta'ala.\nFurthermore, the time between Asr and Maghrib is short. There is a fear that\none who sleeps after Asr may miss his Maghrib with Jamaat. Thus, without a\nstrong need, one should avoid sleeping during these two times.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
