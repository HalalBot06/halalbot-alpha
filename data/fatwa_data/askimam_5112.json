  "question": "WOMEN and MEDICINE",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWOMEN AND MEDICINE My wife insists on working in hospitals and studying further for medicine. For which she has already compromised her integrity and dignity by studying in men for five years. I know that she is one of the clean and pure women but she fails to understand ALLAH has made no exception for doctors or anyone. She says medicine is a noble profession. As she is clean it doesn?t matter even if she has to face men while working. Her father had even allowed to come on television for a medicine related program. She had clips of pictures in the newspaper because of her outstanding achievements. I cant tolerate her talking to any man no matter for what reason. I am myself very strict in avoiding women, so how can i allow her . And its not just my ego, It's all because Allah has strictly forbidden this. In medicine women almost sell themselves. They have night duties, they stay away from home for days and weeks. And THEY are forced to perform duties alone with men. This stupid law is made in pakistan. Its a requirement for girls to work with boys alone in shifts of 8 hours. We have had serious problems because of this. I don?t know what to do. How can we be Muslims by breaking the basic laws of ALLAh. I ask all of them that did ALLAH leave something desired in Quran. They make fun of Islam. If this is not making fun of Islam then what is it. I don?t know how we will face ALLAH.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nClearly your wife is a Naashiza (disobedient) woman. You should first\nexplain what is required of her. Employ wisdom and tact to win her over.\n\nWe do understand that it is very embarrassing for a man to have a wife\nworking alone with strange males for 8 hours a day. Convince her to work\nfrom home. Do not give up hope. Continue making Du'aa for her as well. Since\nyou are the husband, you are obliged to restrict her emergence from home.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
