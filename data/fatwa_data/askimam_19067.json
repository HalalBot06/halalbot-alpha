  "question": "Can a person with objectionable character lead prayer?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it acceptable for a person (‘ālim) to lead the obligatory prayer if his wife has an objectionable character and he is fully aware?  She is involved in harām acts, such as relations with another man.  The husband and others have caught the wife in harām acts with the other man.  Yet, the husband is still forgiving his wife, even though her character is not changing.  The people are trying to explain to the husband that it is not good to give so much freedom to the wife if she is involved in such harām acts. \n\nIn the above circumstances, is it permissible for this husband to lead prayer? \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nNo sane man, let alone an ‘ālim, would allow or accept that his wife involve herself in harām acts with another man.  The imam in question will also not approve of such acts and will do his best to change his wife’s character so that she does not repeat such acts in the future.  However, rarely does a person change overnight.  Reforming a person takes time and wisdom.  The imam is probably making mashwarah (consultation) with other seniors and ‘ulamā on the best steps to guide his wife and save their marriage, which is definitely a better alternative to simply separate from his wife and allow her to continue a life of sin. \n\nSince such matters are usually complicated, the community members should not judge the imam’s actions and jump to conclusions, as the imam would naturally not share all of his private details with them.  They should continue to make du‘ā for him and offer their support.  However, if it is somehow established that the imam does not place proper emphasis on the laws of hijab or that he is able to take adequate measures to prevent his wife from committing harām, yet chooses not to, then such an imam should be warned of the impermissibility of laxity in such matters.  Thereafter, if he still does not make amendments, he should be relieved of his post as it would be impermissible to allow him to lead prayers.\n\n\n(أحسن الفتاوى، كتاب الصلاة، باب الإمامة والجماعة: 3/288؛ سعيد)\n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\n\n\nMuftī Abrar Mirza\nChicago, IL (USA)\n\n \n\nUnder the Supervision of Muftī Ebrahim Desai (South Africa)\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER – AskImam.org questions\n\nAskImam.org answers issues pertaining to Sharī’ah.
