  "answer": "QUESTION\nAslam o alaikum Mufti Sahib. I started praying when i turned 19. I want to pray them as quickly as possible Can i skip all the sunnahs in the prayer and only do the mandatory actions when i am praying my qadah fard salats. For example can i say subhana rabbiyal azeem only once in rukuh and subhana rabbiyal a'la only once in sajdah.
