  "question": "I have a question regarding imam reciting in different prayers. Why imam recites in Fajr, Maghrib and Isha prayers and why not in other two?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalam-o-Alaikum,\n\n1) I have a question regarding imam reciting in different prayers.  Why imam recites in Fajr, Maghrib and Isha prayers and why not in other two?\n\n2) Some Shia friends wait for 10 minutes before breaking fast saying that in Quran its is written to 'complete your sawm till night'. Please provide reference of Ahadis about breaking fast at the time of sunset.\n\n3) I have heard from one Alim that the divison of Quran in 30 chapters was done well after it was originally complied and it make less sense as sometimes a chapter is finished at a point where neither the Surah is finished nor there is any Rukoo. Sometimes there is only a small pert of a surah in one chapter and the other part is in the next. Could you please provide any facts about dividing the Quran in 30 chapters. Who did it and when it was done.\n\nJazak Allah\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\n1)     The procedure of Salah and other acts of worship and Tawqeefi that is dependent of revelation and the procedure shown to us by Rasulullah (SAW). The forms of worship, for example the Rakats in different Salah`s are based on logic. After Me`raj, Allah sent Jibraeel (AS) to demonstrate to Rasulullah (SAW) how each Salah should be performed. We simply follow what we were ordered o do by Allah and his Rasul.    \n\n \n\n2)     The time of Iftar is sunset and it is proven from many Ahadith. Shias do not believe in Hadith and therefore do not practice on the injunctions of the Hadith. This approach is wrong & fundamentally followed.\n\n \n\n3)     The sequence of the Quran ad its Suras is also through revelation. Jibraeel (AS) used o inform Rasulullah (SAW) that a particular revelation will be part of so and so Juz and Sura of the Quran.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
