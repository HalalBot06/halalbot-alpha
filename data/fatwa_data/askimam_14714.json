  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nA mother swears at boy named Mohammed. This boy influenced her son (in early teens) to taste cigarette, which he eventually became addicted to and became a smoker … and later this same boy influenced her son (now in late teens) to take alcohol, to the extent that he started drinking with boy named Mohammed and coming home drunk.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe parents are religious and could not stand this. Out of heart-ache and anger she cursed and swore at boy name Mohammed (not in front of him) who had influenced her son. But, she become fearful after realising she had sworn at the beloved name of the Prophet Mohammed (PBUH).\n\n \n\nCan you give a verdict on this curse and swear the Mother made against name Mohammed? Also, what to do about son?\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram\n\n \n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\n \n\nThe mothers intention was the person and not the name Muhammad. The parents should discuss the issue of the son with their local Alim.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\nThe guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\nEducation and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\nIslam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\nWhen one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\nMuslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\nWe have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\nIf you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\nIf that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\nRasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit”.\n\n \n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
