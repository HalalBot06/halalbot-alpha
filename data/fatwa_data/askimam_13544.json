  "question": "un-intentionally repeats those type of sentences to himself",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nQUESTION:\nDoubts about divorce.\n\nDETAILS:\nI needed some clarification in relation to answer to question 10700 (this was posted on your old askimam.com website).\nWhen One is only thinking about issue of divorce and things that he has\nread on different websites and during this process he sometimes repeats the questions (as\nhe saw on websites posted by other users) in his mind (to himself).\nThese sometimes have sentences that other users posted that mean divorce etc.\nNow if he un-intentionally repeats those type of sentences to himself\nwhile thinking about those questions etc BUT no voice (low or loud\nvoice) at all comes out of his mouth then will any of those\nsentences constitute divorce? So his tongue may have moved within his\nmouth (and at times his mouth/lips might be slightly open too) as he was\ntalking to himself in his head BUT no SPOKEN words came out with any\naudible voice.\nI am trying to make sure that by UTTERING it means words/sentences that\nare spoken with some sort of voice and that can be heard and understood by a human as\nyou mentioned in question 10700. Mostly all this has happened due\nto waswassah and i am trying my best to control these thoughts that\nbother me from time to time. I never have any intention to divorce. Will any of above can cause divorce?\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe mere thought of a divorce and reading about divorce does not constitute a divorce.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
