  "question": "Following Shafi Madhab in Salaah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI always like to follow the masail by Hanafi Alim,\n\n \n\na) Asr prayer Shafei time starts at one Asli, and Hanafi time starts at two Asli(I learnt it by one Alim). If I follow the Shafei and widely accepted (here in KSA) gaire Muqallid time, our Madhhab time no longer starts. If i follow our timing, I have to pray without Jamah and there is great chance of too much questions, especially from Salafis. What should I do?\n\nb) During travelling (Safr) bus stops according to the timing in such a way that we have to pray Juhr and Asr together (during Juhr) and Maghrib and Isha together. What should we do? Repeat those prayers again (qadha) after reaching to our destination, or what?\n\nc) How much we have the preference to stick (regarding the masail) to our own imam(Madhhab)?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1)      There are two views in the Hanafi Mazhab regarding the time of asr .1) The view of Imam Abu Hanifa (rahimahullah) is that asr salaah be performed in mislain. 2) The view of Imam Abu Yusuf and Imam Muhammed (rahimahumullah) are that asr be performed in misle awwal. If you are in such a place where the asr salaah is read in misle awwal, you may perform your salaah in the musjid. However it will be better if you find a musjid that performs asr in mislain.\n\n2)       Salaah is fardh on every male and female and must be performed in its fixed time. Allah states in the Quraan: indeed salaah has been made obligatory upon the believers at fixed times (therefore cannot be performed before the time). You should try to travel in such times were this situation will not occur. For example, if you leave for your destination after esha salaah you will not have to be put in any inconvenience. However should there be a need for you to travel during the day, then try to take such a bus that stops in those times in which you can read each salaah in its prescribed time. Should you be unable to find this type of bus, then request the driver of the bus to stop at asr time or ask him to stop in such a time were you may be able to make jam-e- sowari (to perform one salaah at its last time and the other salaah in its beginning time)\n\n3)      Under normal circumstances one is not allowed to come out of the perimeters of the mazhab. However should there be a genuine need, then one should consult with the Ulama of that mazhab and discuss with them.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
