  "question": "Is it permitted for a Father to take his 5 years old son to the Mosque for Juammah Prayer? If not then what a Father should do If there is no one to take care of the child during Jummah time?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. I live in London. I use to go for Jumma Prayers along with my four and a half years old son. The reason I took my son along with me was that there is no one who can take care of him when I go to Jumma Prayers. But Couple of Weeks back the Imam of the Mosque has told not to bring the small children in the mosque as they may disturb the others. In this regard he also gave referenece of some Hadith. My question is now What should I do? If I dont take my son with me then, there is no one to take care of him. I haven't gone for last two Jumma's in the Mosque. Please guide me. 2. My Second question is if someone miss Fajr Prayer do he need to perform qaza for the two sunnat prayers also?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. What the Imaam said is correct and is the general rule. In your case, you\nshould do your best to find an alternative for your son. If there is no\nalternative available, then you are excused because of the extraordinary\ncircumstances of your case. It may be advisable to inform the Imaam of your\ncase.\n2. If you are making the Qadhaa before Zawaal of that day, you should make\nQadhaa of the Sunnats as well. If the Qadhaa of Fajr is made at any time\nlater than Zawaal, the only Qadhaa of the Fardh should be made.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
