  "answer": "QUESTION\nSir I put some money in bank in India now bank is paying interest what can be done with it. 1. In India can I give it to some poor deserving needy Muslim student to pursue their education? 2. Use it for bails etc of Muslim in India. 3. Or burn it. (As I asked a sheikh here in Kuwait and they say burn it). 4. Toilet construction Jazak Allaho Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nInterest monies must be given to the poor and needy who are eligible to accept Zakaat without the intention of reward.\n\nA poor and needy student qualifies to accept interest money. If the imprisoned person is poor and needy, he too qualifies to accept interest monies. Interest monies should not be burned or used for toilet construction.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
