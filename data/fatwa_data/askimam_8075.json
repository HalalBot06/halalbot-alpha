  "question": "What is wahdatul wujood and is it correct to believe in it? I have read in several places that this means to believe that Allah (swt) is everywhere",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n, not just in the sense that His knowledge is everywhere and that He sees everything, but literally everywhere. I thought Allah (swt) was above the Arsh and Kursi? I know that He is not limited or anything but isn?t this what the Quran says, that He is above the Arsh and Kursi?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In the terminology of the Soofis, Wahdatul Wujood means to believe that all the Mawjoodaat (things present around us) are an indication of Allah?s presence and to believe that everything besides Allah is subjective.\n\n2. Allah is Omnipotent. Where the text make mention of Allah being on the throne or Kursi, is not in reality but it is merely an indication of His grandeur and majesty over His entire creation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
