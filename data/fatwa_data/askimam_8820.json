  "answer": "QUESTION\nAslaam alekum. I am a 15 year old girl and I really want something. I want to do well in my exams and although I have already done them, I want to ask Allah for help for success in the future and want the results to be good. I know namaz is the answer, and I know several duas (e.g) YAH FATAH HO (I apologize for incorrect spelling). And I realize that you can pray normally for something as well. But are there any special methods for asking for something? I hope I am not being selfish and if I am without realizing I hope Allah forgives me. I don?t want to just pray for me, but for my parents- I want them to be happy generally and proud of me. I only want to ask for good things. I want to take this opportunity to thank you for answering my previous question. You might not realize but you stopped me from sinning. Thank you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour mail brought a lump to my throat and the Praise of Almighty Allah Ta'ala to my lips. I am so pleased that you have the love of Allah Ta'ala and your parents in your heart. You are still young and insha'allah, may you always remain conscious of your duty to Allah Ta'ala and yourself so that you are guided to act carefully and wisely. Ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou mention that you abstained from sinning. This has brought you much closer to Allah Ta'ala than you can ever realize. You have acted on the knowledge which was presented to you and you acted to please your Creator, Alhamdoelillah!! Please try to remember this whenever you are faced with difficult choices. Before a Muslim indulges in any act, he%2Fshe should ask, \" If I say or do this, will my Allah Ta'ala be pleased with me?\" If the answer is \"no\", it means one should abstain from that act even though one may derive pleasure in indulging in that particular act.%0D%0A%0D%0APlease do not ever think that you are selfish if you ask for anything good, for yourself or for other human beings. Allah Ta'ala loves us to ask HIM for whatever need we have. It does not matter whether it is a social, spiritual, physical or material need. You can ask for your personal health, to increase your knowledge which will benefit you in this world and the hereafter or for scholarly success. Allah Ta'ala has such vast treasures that even if HE had to continuously give to every creation of HIS all the time, there will be no end to His store of treasures. We may get tired of asking, but Allah Ta'ala will never tire of giving to us. So go on asking, the more you ask, the more pleased your Creator will be with you. Remember, Allah Ta'ala \"uses\" all of us to assist each other. Our parents, families, friends, teachers etc. are also used by Allah Ta'ala to help fulfill our needs.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is commendable that you have a desire to please your parents. May Allah Ta'ala guide you and cause you to be the coolness of their eyes, ameen. It is commendable to remember your parents in your duas after every fard salaah. Make duas straight from your heart and ask Allah Ta'ala to grant to your parents whatever you wish for them and whatever needs they have. You can include, protection from calamity and evil, strengthening of their imaan, Guidance to do good, forgiveness for their sins, increased love between your parents, between the children and them, ask Allah Ta'ala to put love into the hearts of others for your parents, to make you, your brothers and sisters the coolness of your parents eyes, etc. ( Don't forget to ask all the same for yourself too). An ideal way to make dua (if you have time) would be to perform ablution, and supplicate with concentration and sincerity. Start by mentioning the beautiful names of Allah Ta'ala, send Darood on our beloved Nabi (sallallaahu alayhi wassallam) and then mention your needs. ( Do remember though that duas are accepted even if one is not able to make ablution).%0D%0A%0D%0ADUAAS FOR STUDYING%0D%0A%0D%0ADua Before Studying%0D%0A\"Allahumma infa'nii bimaa 'allamtanii wa'allimnii maa yanfa'uunii.
