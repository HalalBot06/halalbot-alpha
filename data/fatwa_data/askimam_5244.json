  "question": "Salam Mufti, I would like to know about the controversy surrounding Ibn AbdulWahhab. Do you think the Ottoman Caliph was right to send Muhammad Ali Pasha to stop the wahhabi fitna?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nImam Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab\n\nImam Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab was born in the town of Uyaina to a highly\nrespected and religious family. In keeping with his family tradition, he\nexhibited a keen interest in religion and was profoundly perturbed by\ncontemporary deviations from Islamic teachings which included serious\ndeviations from the teachings of the Prophet, (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\nHe therefore undertook to bring about a revival of Islam in its simplest and\noriginal form. Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab did not found a new sect. His sole\npurpose was to re-establish Islam in its purest form.\n\nHis forthright sermons led to his persecution. When he and his family were\ndriven out of Uyaina, Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab sought the protection of\nMuhammad bin Saud, in Ad-Dar’iyah, the home of the House of Saud.\n\nMuhammad bin Saud and Imam Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab found they had\ninterests in common, pre-eminently a desire to see all the Arabs of the\nPeninsula brought back to Islam in its simplest and purest form. In 1744,\nthey therefore took an oath that they would work together to achieve this\nend. Muhammad bin Saud’s son, Abdul Aziz, married the daughter of Imam\nMuhammad. Thus, with an oath and a marriage, the two leaders sealed a pact\nbetween their families which has lasted through the centuries to the present\nday.\n\nImam Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab died in 1792."
