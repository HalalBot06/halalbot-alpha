  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have recently returned from Umrah, and I thank Allah for giving me the opportunity to visit such a blessed place in Makkah and Madina Sharif.\nMy question is while I was there I performed my Nikah in Madina Sharif in Masjid Nabawi. I know that I am very lucky to have been able to perform my Nikah in such a blessed place, as many people travel thousands of miles to have their Nikah there, and I was lucky enough to be there and everything just happen without any planning. But I do not understand what it means. I would be grateful if you could explain to me what it means for a person to have their Nikah performed in Masjid Nabawi.\nI would also like to mention that there were not many people present in my nikah, as it was not possible to have it done on the microphone.\nPeople present were the Alim, my father, father in law, and 2 witnesses. So was not like other nikah’s where a lot of people are sitting around and making dua after the nikah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is undoubtedly a great blessing of Allah Ta'aala that He granted you the opportunity to have had you nikah done in the masjid of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wa Sallam). You should thank Allah Ta'aala for bestowing upon you such a blessing and privelage by wholeheartedly embracing His commands and emulating the ways of his beloved Nabi (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) in all spheres of your life including, but not restricted to, your married and family life. Since your nikah took place in the blessed masjid of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wa Sallam), you should intend to carry on the legacy of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) by calling others to the deen of Allah Ta'aala and His commands and spreading the teachings of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wa Sallam). Also make intention that if Allah Ta'aala bestows you with children you will make them hafiz of the Holy Quran and Alim of deen.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\n\n\nMl.
