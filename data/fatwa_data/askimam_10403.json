I was unaware of 3 talaaqs and,we are completely separated.I was ignorant in divorce(taalaq).had no intention(niet).I love my religion, and my wife and she loves me. we want Allah?s blessings and to make a life and home.is this taalaq vaild?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe understand you are a new Muslim but do not understand your explanation of ignorance of divorce. When your wife requested you to divorce her, you responded ?no?, ?will never divorce you?.\n\nWhat is the difference between that and stating to your wife ?I divorce you three times? upon the instruction of your father-in-law. You could have refused your father-in-law just as you refused your wife.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
