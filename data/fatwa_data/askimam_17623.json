  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI   recently got married and after marriage I find out my husband is physically unfit I told him it ok and we will seek medical help. Now He gets really mad at me for no reasons and when I say something he gets offended I am trying to make him understand that you will be fine and I will still live with you but now he stopped living with me and he says he have to take care of his mother back home. And he says you can’t live with us because my mother doesn’t like you. I am living without him and without any rights and financial help. Please tell me is this right to ask for divorce and move on. Or I should wait and see but he does not even call me from there since he says his mother does’nt like that. Please reply. its already 9 months and he went to doctors and doesnot tell me what is happening.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nWe sympathize with you and understand your pain and difficulties.\n\nUnfortunately, your husband is very irresponsible. He has failed in fulfilling his marital obligations to you. He ought to be providing shelter, food and clothing for you. He ought to be staying with you. Instead he presents the excuse to take care of his mother.\n\nHe further has the audacity to state his mother doesn’t like you. He gets upset when you advise him for his own benefit and welfare. This is not what marriage is meant to be.\n\nOur advice is you make Istikhara regarding breaking the marriage and moving on with your life. If you are satisfied with that then ask him to divorce you or refer to your local Ulama and request him to annul the marriage.\n\nYou should not live in false love and hope. Turn to Allah. He will guide you and open doors or mercy and happiness for you.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
