  "question": "Is it permissible to sit or sleep on a place higher in level than the Quraan when one is reciting it. ? Is it permissible to recite Quraan facing the back of a person ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe underlying principle to determine the permissibility of sitting or sleeping on a place higher than the Qur'aan is respect to the Qur'aan, which is compulsory.\n\nRespect is a relative issue and it varies according to place and situation. A particular act may be regarded as respect in one's situation or in one place whereas the same act will be regarded as disrespectful in other situations and places. If the sitting and sleeping posture higher than the Qur'aan is regarded as disrespectful, then it is not permissible to adopt that posture. If it is not regarded as disrespectful, then it is permissible.\n\nHowever, generally, to be higher than the Qur'aan in any posture is regarded as disrespectful. It is, therefore, advisable to exercise precaution and not\nto sit or sleep higher than the Qur'aan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
