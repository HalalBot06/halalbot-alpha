  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have heard that the month of 'safar' brings alot of hardships and suffering for the ppl more than in any other month. Is this true?? If it is what can we do to protect ourselves from the miseries and distress brought upon during this month?? Can u please quote any hadith related to it. JazakAllah Kahir\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ: There is a general perception that the months of Muharram and Safar have an evil in them and anything major done in these months, for example, purchasing a business, house, making Nikah, etc. is unsuccessful. Kindly explain if the perception is correct or not according to Shari?ah.\n\nA: To regard the Islamic months of Muharram and Safar as ?unlucky? months and suspend important matters with the fear of them being unsuccessful was the belief of the pre-Islamic era. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) condemned this belief. Hadhrat Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, \"There is no bad omen.\" (Mishkat pg.391) In another narration, it is recorded, \"There is no (bad omen) in (the month of) Safar\". (Ibid)\n\nTherefore, one should not suspend any matter in Muharram and Safar with the belief that they are unlucky months.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
