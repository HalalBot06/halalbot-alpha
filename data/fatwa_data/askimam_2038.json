Now what measures should i take to have the least possible encounter with girls?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn an instance where a person is encountered with females, he should ensure\nthat no intermingling takes place. Care should be taken to lower one's gazes\nfor Allah Ta'ala mentions in the noble Qur'aan, 'Say (O Muhammad) to the\nbelieving males that they should lower their gazes and protect their private\nparts.'
