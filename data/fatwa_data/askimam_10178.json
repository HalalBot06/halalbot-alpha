  "question": "What is the ruling on those who fasted based on sighting the moon without the naked eye and they start fasting three days after?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat night is the real Lailatul Qadr nightif we assume it to be the 29th. People who fasted with technology,sighting with naked eye or people some where in the world in winter unable to see moon and starts fastiing 3 days after moon is born.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n1) Rasulullah (Salla Allahu alahi wa sallam) said - Fast when you see the moon (Ramadhan) and break your fast when you see the moon (Shawwal). Muslims around the world are duty bound to look for the moon of Ramadhan. If the moon cannot be sighted, they must commence Ramadhan after completing 30 days of Shaban. It is irresponsible to commence fast three days after the moon is born. \n\n\n2) It is incorrect to assume Lailatul Qadr to be on the 29th. However, Rasulullah (Salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam) encouraged searching for Lailatul Qadr in the last ten nights of Ramadhan.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
