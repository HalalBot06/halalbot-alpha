  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ncan we eat meat in oder contry non muslim?\n\nsalam il from one small island in portugal here there is non muslims at all. can i eat meat not halal when i go for holidays?and if i go to live there forever?can i eat?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nShari’ah has emphasised on eating Halaal. There are two levels of Halaal, a) Income, and b) Matter and ingredient.\n\nThe income of a person must be according to the Shari’ah. If a person purchased Halaal food with Haraam income, it will not be permissible to consume the Halaal food as the source of acquiring it is Haraam. The other level of Halaal is regarding the matter and ingredients. If one has a Halaal source of income but the food item acquired is Haraam or has Haraam ingredients, it will not be permissible to consume such an item.\n\nIt is for this reason Allah Ta’ala orders us, ‘Do not the animal upon which the name of Allah is not taken’. The Qur’aan enumerates other Haraam items as well. For example, Maytah (carrion), flowing blood, the flesh of swine, an animal that died through being strangled or throttled, etc. If Halaal food is not available, one may eat non-meat or vegetarian food. The only time one will be excused from consuming Haraam food is when he is starving to the point of death and there is no alternate food. If you go on holiday and there are no Muslims and no Halaal food, or Halaal meat, then arrange for preparing your own food or eat non-meat products.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
