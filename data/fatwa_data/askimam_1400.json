  "question": "Is it halal to cut contact with kufaar and fellow Muslims if they don't reply to you?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a Muslima. When I phone or e-mail fellow Muslima 'friends' they often don't reply to me until weeks later or not at all. How can there be a friendship when only one person contacts the other one? Also my relatives who live overseas who are kufaar didn't contact me when I got married, gave birth, and when my husband's father died--do I have to maintain contact with them? I just feel like cutting contact with all these people because I'm upset. Jazak Allah khair for your time to reply.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shariah, the right of a relationship depends on the level\nof\nthe relationship. The closer the relationship, the greater the right.\n\nThere is a difference between a friendly relationship and family\nrelationship. A friendly relationship is mubaah (permissible) if there is\nnothing unIslamic in such a relationship.\n\nIf your friends do not respond to you, there is no sin upon you to terminate\nyour correspondence with them. It is inetiquette of them not to respond to\nyou. As regards family relationships, it is compulsory to maintain ties with\nthem even though they may break up with you. You should regard your\ncommunication with them as fulfilling the order of Allah and perhaps one day\nthey will respond. That will reflect Islamic morals and etiquettes to them\nand could be a means of Dawah to Islam to them.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti E Desai\nFatwa Dept."
