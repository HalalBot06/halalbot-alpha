  "question": "1. If I wear a taweez as medication, do I have to take it off as soon as I am cured from that particular illness? 2. please read the article ‘On Raising the Hands in Prayer’ by Shaikh Mubarakpuri",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n2.Can taweez be worn for other than as medication, i.e. to increase knowledge or for protection against ?nazzar?, etc.? 3. I know that the Sahaaba (R.A) used the Quranic aayahs to cure themselves but they did not do so by tying the taweez around their necks. So wouldn?t tying a taweez around the neck be bid?ah? 4. I have heard that it is bid?ah to do tasbeeh with beads ON A STRING. The Prophet (Pbuh) directly ordered the counting of tasbeeh with the fingers, ?That the Prophet (Pbuh) commanded them to count on their fingers, for they (the fingers) will be questioned and interrogated (about it)? What is the ruling regarding this? Could you please read the article ?On Raising the Hands in Prayer? by Shaikh Mubarakpuri and let us know what you think (http://www.troid.org/files4/raising%20of%20hands.htm).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Kindly refer below our standard reply to similar queries - Ta'weez%0D%0A2. The idea is to count the Dhikr. Be it counted with the fingers or with%0D%0Abeads, both are permissible. It is recorded in Abu-Dawood Shareef that some%0D%0ASahaabi had some beads (seeds) to count Dhikr upon.%0D%0A3. Today, it is Raf-ul-Yadayn, tomorrow it could be Ameen bil Jahr or Sirr%0D%0Aand following some other differences. Therefore, in the interest of the%0D%0Acommunity at large, we suggest you continue with the necessary Da%E1wah work%0D%0Aand propagate the faith at all times. With regard to the Salafis, the%0D%0Adiscussion should not be on making Raf-ul-yadayn or not, but making Taqleed%0D%0Aof a specific Imaam. Kindly find below our standard reply on Raf-ul-yadayn%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta%E3la says in the Noble Qur%E3n, 'In the Qur%E3n is (spiritual, physical)%0D%0Acure for people.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThe opening chapter of the Noble Qur%E3n, Surah Faatiha is also called the%0D%0Achapter of Shifaa. It is recorded in the Bukhari Shareef vol. 1 p. , 'A%0D%0Aruler of a certain clan was stung by a creature, the people of the area%0D%0Arequested the Sahaaba to cure him, one Sahaabi read Surah Faatiha and blew%0D%0Aon the affected area and cured the ruler. The Prophet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam) even praised the Sahaabi for doing so.%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the above quotations, it is clear that the verses of the Noble Qur%E3n is%0D%0Aa means of cure. Treating oneself with Taweez containing verses of the Qur%E3n%0D%0Ais similar to treating oneself with medication. By using medication, one%0D%0Amerely places his trust in Allah Ta%E3la and use the medication as a means of%0D%0Acure. The effect in the means is with the Will of Allah Ta%E3la so, too is the%0D%0Ausage of the Taweez.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe art of making Taweez is a science independent to other known sciences.%0D%0APeople who have studied this science are most knowledgeable to explain its%0D%0Avast understanding. One thing must be outlined at the outset is that anyone%0D%0Apractising the making of Taweez cannot ascribe (in his method and%0D%0Aapplication) partners with Allah Ta%E3la. Any act of Kufr is unacceptable in%0D%0AIslam.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe people during the time of Jaahiliyya had an incorrect belief that the%0D%0Astars and planets cause rainfall, but the Prophet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam) dismissed that. The drawings and illustrations used in Taweez are%0D%0Alike the concepts used in geometry, etc. to arrive at a solution.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn conclusion, consider the following Hadith: Abu Khuzaymah (Radhiallaahu%0D%0A%C1nhu) narrates from his father that he asked Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam), 'Inform me about Rukan (blowing in water and Taweez), medication,%0D%0Aand means of security, does it change Taqdeer (predestination)? He replied,%0D%0A'They (all the above) are within Taqdeer. (Mishk%E3t pg. 22)"
