  "question": "Is going to the stage of Mareyfat (spiritual state of Islam) the ultimate state of becoming a true muslim? Is it mandatory for every muslim to go to that state",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn a small Masjid I am visiting these days, they are between Imams. Generally a gentleman without a beard, who seems to be quite knowledgeable about Deen, and knows a lot of Qur?an permits himself to lead the Jamaat. There are other people in the Jamaat with beards of various lengths, who I am sure can recite some Qur?an from memory, and none has objected so far. Is such a Salaat by Jamaat valid, or am I better off praying @home?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nLiterally, Faasiq means one who stray from the right course. According to the Shari?ah, it refers to one who commits a major sin like adultery, drinking wine, etc. There is a long list of major sins which are mentioned in the Aqedah books.\n\nThe reason why a person is considered as a Faasiq is that he is committing a major sin. There are Ahaadith wherein lengthening of the beard are mentioned. Hadhrat Shaykh Zakariyyah [ra] has compiled a book which proves the necessity of keeping a beard to a minimum of one fist length from all around the face.\n\nTherefore, it is Makrooh-e-Tahrimi for a Faasiq to make Imaamat. At all cost, this person must not be allowed to make the Imaamat. If he is put there by the trustees, etc. and one has no choice but to read behind him, then instead of performing Salaat individually one should read the Salaat with Jamaat behind him. The sin will be on the trustees themselves.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desa"
