WATER: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said the best drink in this world and the next is H20,when you thirsty drink it by sips and not gulps, gulping produces sickness of the liver.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe were only able to trace the following:\n\n1. None of the narrations regarding the melon have been established besides the fact that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), ate it. (see al-Maqaasidul Hasanah pgs175-176, al-laalil masnoo?ah vol.2 pg.210 and al-Masnoo?ah of Mulla Ali Qari pg.77)\n\n2. The narration you question regarding ?Lubbaan? which you have translated as milk has also been classified as unauthentic. (see Tanzeehu Shari?ah vol.2 pg.262)\n\n3. Regarding the mushroom, it being a cure for the eyes is recorded by Imaam Bukhari in his Sahih (Hadith4487, 4639 and 5708). However, the type of mushroom refered to in this Hadith should be verified first.\n\n4. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) being very fond of grapes has been recorded by Imaam Abu Nu?aim in his al-Tibbun Nabawiy and Imaam ibn Aadi in his al-Kaamil. Hafiz al-Iraaqi has classified these narrators as weak. (Takhureejul Ihyaa vol.2 pg.331)\n\n5. Dates to be eaten at the time of birth is recorded by Imaam Abu Ya?ala in his Musnad (see Majma-uz-zawaaid vol.5 pg.39; also refer Tanzihu Shari?ah vol.1 pg.209, vol.2 pg.240). Though the Ulama have disputed its authenticity, its meaning may also be established by the Qur?aan (Surah Maryam verse25-26). Imaam Muslim and Tirmidhi among others have recorded the narration of Sayyidatuna Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?That house which doesn?t have dates has no food.? (Sahih Muslim Hadith5305; Sunan Tirmidhi Hadith1815)\n\n6. Drinking water in sips and not in gulps has been mentioned in numerous Ahaadith recorded by Imaams: Baghawi, Tabraani, ibn Mandah and others (refer to Takhrijul Ihyaa vol.2 pg.334; Majma-uz-zawaaid vol.5 pg.80). However, we have not found any mention of ?gulping causing a sickness of the liver?.\n\nand Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\n \n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
