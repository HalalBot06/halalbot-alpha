  "question": "Dear Mufti I would like to ask can a woman divorce her husband if he wants to marry again. Is that acceptable in Islam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlmighty Allah Ta'ala being the Creator of man and woman fully well knows\ntheir temperaments. He has revealed his Shari'ah according to those\ntemperaments. Our success lies in obeying the laws of Shari'ah. According to\nthe Shari'ah, only the man has the right of divorce.\n\nNevertheless, entering into polygamous marriage is not a valid excuse to\nannul the marriage. Our advise is that the person exercise patience and time\nwill heal your wounds. However, if you are unable to do so, then she may\nrequest her husband for a divorce in lieu of cash or kind (Khula). However,\nthe husband may accept the offer or decline it. (Kifaayatul Mufti vol.6\npg.127)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
