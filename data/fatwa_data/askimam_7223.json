  "question": "I have a tamil neighbour who buys fruit/sweets for our children. She assures us that she buys only halaal. She also has an interest acc at ABSA. Can my children consume her food?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis good offering of your neighbour should be welcomed.\n\nYou should use this as a means of getting them closer to Islam. We suggest you educate your children to accept the fruits and sweets but if there is any doubt of halaal and haraam they should abstain and without the knowledge of your nieghbour dispose of the sweets or fruits.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
