  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nRespected Ulema, I would appreciate any assistance rendered to me in acquiring any relevant material regarding the prohibition of oral sex mentioned in the classical books of fiqh etc. Reason being is below you will find a responce given by one of the Ulema here in Canada (and posted on their Darul Iftaa web page)  pretaining to this question which is completly against the teachings of Islam.\n\nQuestion:\n\n \n\nI have a question regarding the sex life of a married Islamic couple. Does Islam allow wife or husband to suck the private parts (Vagina, penis) of each other before having intercourse. Is it allowed to have a anal sex with your wife. What is religious point of view in this regard.\n\n \n\nAnswer:\n\n \n\nAssalaamualaikum,\n\n\nThe following are the answers to your queries;\n\n1.     There is no prohibition found on having oral sex with one's spouse in any of the classical texts. Allah has mentioned in the Qur'an while enumerating the attributes of a believer,\"And they who guard their private parts. Except from their wives or those their right hands possess, for indeed, they will not be blamed.\" (23:5-6)\n\nNo commentary is found on this verse in which such an act has been prohibited. However one should bear in mind that tremendous caution should be exercised in discharging pre-seminal fluid or semen in the mouth of the other as these fluids are impure and to intake impure fluids is haraam.\n\n\n    2. Anal sex is strictly prohibted in Islam. The Prophet pbuh has warned:\n\n\"Do not approach women in their anus (for fulling your carnal desires)\". (Tirmithi: 1164)\n\"Allah does not glance towards that man who approaches another man or a woman (for fulfilling his sexual desires) in (their) anus.\" (Tirmithi: 1165)\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n\nDarul Iftaa\n\nJam'iyyatul Ulama Canada\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAt the outset, before stating the rulings of Fuqahaa on oral sex, it is important to mention the emphasis Shari’ah has laid down on shame and modesty. Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) has said in Hadith:\n\nإن مما أدرك الناس من كلام النبوة ، إذا لم تستحى فافعل ما شئت\n\n\"Indeed, surely people will come to know the words of prophethood. If you do not have shame, then do as you wish.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, 4/183, Dar Al-Fikr)\n\nالحياء من الإيمان والإيمان فى الجنة والبذاء من الجفاء والجفاء فى النار\n\n\"Modesty is from Iman, and Iman leads you to Paradise. Shamelessness is from futile things, and futile things lead you to the fire of Hell.” (Sunan Al-Tirmidhi, 2/21, HM Saeed)\n\nIn light of the abovementioned, Fuqahaa have ruled oral sex to be makruh tahreemi (an abominable act close to haraam) due to the shame and immodesty in the act and the strong possibility of najis (impure) fluids entering the mouth. Even if precaution is taken in this regard, it is a shameful act to use the mouth in such places, as it is the same mouth used to recite Quran and to make zikr of Allah Ta’ala. This ruling applies to the performance of oral sex by the wife to the husband and vice-versa.\n\nIt is unfortunate to see the steep decline of modesty and the increase of shame in our time compared to the pure era of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the Sahaba (RadiyAllahu Anhum). There was so much modesty in their time that Sayyidina A’isha (RadiyAllahu Anha) reported that she never saw the private parts of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) and he never saw hers. (Ibn Majah, Ahmed)\n\nMay Allah Ta’ala give us all the guidance to follow their example. Aameen.\n\nFurthermore, it is incorrect to state that there is no prohibition of oral sex in classified texts of the Fuqahaa. Consider the following two texts:\n\nفي النوازل إذا أدخل الرجل ذكره في فم امرأته قد قيل يكره\n\n(Al-Fatawa al-Hindiyya, 5/372, Rashidiyya)\n\n \n\nإذا أدخل الرجل ذكره فم أمرأته فقد قيل: يكره؛ لأنه موضع قراءة القرآن، فلا يليق به إدخال الذكر فيه، وقد قيل بخلافه.\n\n(Al-Muhit al-Burhani, 8/134, Idaratul Quran)\n\n(Fatawa Rahimiyyah, 10/178, Darul Isha’at)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\nMl.
