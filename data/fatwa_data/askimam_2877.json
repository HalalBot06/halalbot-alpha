  "question": "Is there any ibadah (such as salatul tasbeeh, fasting on day of arafat, etc) that can be done to be forgiven of a major sin and not just a minor sin?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n2) I want to keep a fist-length beard but my non-muslim parents insist I trim it shorter. Do they have this right over me? - please advice.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In principle, it is necessary to make sincere Tawbah (repent) from major\nsins. In order for a major sin to be forgiven, one must sincerely repent\n(make Tawbah) by regretting committing the sin and making a firm conviction\nnever to repeat the sin. If one is sincere, Allah is Tawwaab (most\nforgiving)\n2. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'There is no obedience of\nany creation in the disobedience of Allah. To trim the beard lesser than the\nspan of a fist is not permissible. You should display good character before\nyour parents and apply wisdom and diplomacy in keeping a Sunnah beard.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
