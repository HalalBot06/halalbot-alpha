  "question": "I was forced married to my cousin brother without my will. Is this marriage VALID or INVALID.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was forced married to my cousin brother in Bangladesh without my will, In the nikah ceremoney I did not give my consent by saying KOBUL instead I said BUL which means wrong, I said that for the marriage not to take place. I want to know is this marriage VALID or INVALID.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is obvious that there is a dispute regarding the validity of your marriage. You attempt to claim your marriage is invalid. The other party may attempt to claim the marriage is valid. It is not appropriate for us to issue a ruling unilaterally in a known dispute. That may have ramifications on the other party.\n\nAs a suggestion, we suggest you adopt a middle path. Consult a local Aalim or body to intervene and, in the prense of both parties, try and resolve the issue amicably.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
