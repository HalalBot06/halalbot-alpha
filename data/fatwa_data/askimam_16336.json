  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a problem. Whenver I get up in the morning I see some sort of stains in my undergarments though I did't have a nightfall. Does that make it necessary for me to take ghusl. Problem here is this thing happens almost everyday. I get really depressed by this. I am trying my best to get away from bad things but I really get depressed when this thing happens. I used to study in the morning but now I cannot justbecause I think it is not appropriate to study until I take ghusl.\n\nOne other thing, I am really worried about cleanliness. I live in a hostel. It's dirty in here. Sometimes I take 1hr to take bath 'coz I cannot convince myself that the bucket is clean and I keep washing it. I repeat the process if I feel some drops of water have fallen tin the bucket while taking bath. So, I wash it again. I also have the habit of washing my hands too often.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1.      If you did not have a nightfall (wetdream), then the stains could be mazi or urine.\n\nMazi is the emission of fluid during erection. Mazi and urine are impure. However, they do not necessitate ghusal. It will suffice for you to wass the stains on your undergarments. There is no need for you to be depressed. You should continue your studies and other forms of worship.\n\n2.      If the bucket is rinsed once, that makes the bucket clean. The water in it is pure. The splashes that come into the bucket do not make the bucket or the other water in it impure. You should avoid having unnecessary doubts. That is the course of your difficulty and depression.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
