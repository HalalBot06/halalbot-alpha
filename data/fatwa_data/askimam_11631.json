  "question": "The word \"fesabillilah\"?Is it permissible to go out in jamaat and label it as \"fesabillilah\"",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it permissible to go out in jamaat and label it as \"fesabillilah\" (since some people say this word can only be associated with going for war)? Also where in the quran does it mention that everything has been predestined by Allah for everyone (Rizq, marriage partner etc)? Jazakallah and may Allah reward you?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Allah Ta?ala states in the Qur?aan, ?And struggle for the sake of Allah as it is required?? Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] said, ?Whoever goes out seeking for knowledge is in the path of Allah.? In view of the above, it is permissible to go out in Jamaat as this is also ?fee sabeelillah? and this has been emphasised in the Qur?aan. Fee sabeelillah includes all kinds of efforts and struggle, e.g. tongue, pen, money, body, etc. (Kanzul Ummaal vol.10 pg.158)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Taqdeer refers to absolute and comprehensive knowledge of Allah. Whatever is in the knowledge of Allah regarding the future, that will never change as the knowledge of Allah is perfect and absolute.%0D%0AAs human being, we are instructed to make an effort in fulfilling the ordains of Allah. We are also instructed to make du?aa. Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] said, ?Du?aa is a weapon of a believer. If anything could change Taqdeer, it would be Du?aa.? Allah Ta?ala tells us of His absolute knowledge of five things in the Qur?aan ? The time of Qiyaamat, the coming of rain, knowledge of what is in the womb of a pregnant womb, what a person will earn tomorrow, where a person will die.%0D%0AThe absolute and complete details of these five are only known to Allah. Whatever is known of these five is not absolute and comprehensive.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
