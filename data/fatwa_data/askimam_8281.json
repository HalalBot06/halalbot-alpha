You write about the difficulties in your relationship with your husband.%0D%0A%0D%0AI would like to know if your husband's attitude towards you has been like this always or is it since he has had his heart problem only? Is your husband able to go out to work and is he earning the same amount as he did before he became ill? I am also wondering if his medication is causing him to become depressed and perhaps if this is the reason why he is taking out his frustration and anger out on you. Have you discussed his attitude with his doctor? If you have not done so, do you think you could do so soon?%0D%0A%0D%0AHis illness and his attitude must be causing a strain on you and it must be difficult for you to cope with it. May Allah Ta'ala soften your hearts towards each other, bring you closer together and may Allah Ta'ala reward you abundantly for your sabr and perseverance.%0D%0A%0D%0APlease respond to my questions above so that we can explore your problem further.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0ASister Fadila%0D%0ASOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
