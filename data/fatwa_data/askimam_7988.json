  "question": "If a man has intercourse for a long period [i.e. 5 to 10 minutes] with his wife but he does not ejaculate",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. does he have to make ghusul or is wudo enough for him to perform salat? 2: how about the wife, does she have to make ghusul or wodu to make salat?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nReaching climax is not a condition for Ghusl to become necessary.\n\nAs soon as the husband?s private part enters his wife?s private part, Ghusl becomes necessary on both even though the man does not ejaculate.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
