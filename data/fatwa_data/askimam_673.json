  "question": "What does the Shariah say about entering within the Miqaat boundaries in the months of Haj? Especially if you did not perform your Haj as yet.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen a person enters into the boundaries of Meeqaat, he has to be in the state of Ihraam. Therefore, he has to come out of the Ihraam by at least performing Umrah.\n\nIf he had performed Umrah and has the means to perform Hajj, then Hajj is also compulsory. He can come out of the Meeqaat after performing Umrah and return for Hajj.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
