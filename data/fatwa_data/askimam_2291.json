  "question": "Are Women allowed to pray salat in the Masjid in congregation?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan women join the jamat with men in the masjid? If so, is a curatain to seperate them required? If so, why is there no purdah in Al-Haram and Al Nabwi?Can you please provide support with your answer as I must explain this to someone who wants it. JazakAllah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n%0D%0AHadhrat %DAmar (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) said that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam) said, 'When your womenfolk request permission of you to attend the%0D%0AMasjid at night, grant them permission.' (Sahih Bukhari vol. 1 p. 119,%0D%0AChapter on women coming out to the Masjid).%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the light of this Hadith, Imaam Maalik (Rahmatullaahi %C1layhi) said, 'This%0D%0AHadith and other similar ones (wherein permission is granted to women to%0D%0Aattend the Masjid) apply to old women.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllamah Khirmani (Rahmatullaahi %C1layhi) says that permission for ladies%0D%0Aattending the Masjid is applicable to the night time as stated in this%0D%0AHadith. And that permission is in the absence of Fitnah or mischief against%0D%0Awomen or by women. During the lifetime of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam) the absence of mischief was dominant.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllama Alayni (RA) says, 'Verily, during our age mischief and evil deeds are%0D%0Arife. (Footnote of Bukhari Shareef vol. 1 p. 119 Pakistani print).%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat %C1aisha (Radhiallaahu %C1nha) narrates that if Nabi (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam) knew what the women are doing he would have prevented them from%0D%0Athe Masjid just as the women of Bani Israaeel were prevented.' (Bukhari vol.%0D%0A1 p. 120)%0D%0A%0D%0AUnder this Hadith, Imaam Taymi says that this Hadith contains substantiation%0D%0Afor the view that 'it is not proper for women to emerge (from their homes)%0D%0Ato go to the Masjids when mischief becomes rife.' (Footnote of Bukhari%0D%0AShareef vol. 1 p. 120 Pakistani print).%0D%0A%0D%0AThe law will be the same, be it in Makkah or elsewhere in the world because%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) advised the women to read Salaat in%0D%0Atheir homes.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
