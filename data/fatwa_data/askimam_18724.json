  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nWhat is the best way to deal with Anger and Waswasas?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nANGER\n\nANSWER TO THE FIRST QUERY: Anger is natural to man. There is no man without the instinct of anger. Allah has placed this quality in man for some reason. It is given to man for the purpose of protecting himself, his possessions, his family and his relatives. If he is bereft of the quality of anger then he will never be angry and never defend himself when attacked by an enemy or an animal. So, man is allowed to show anger to protect himself and, the Shariah has not placed any restriction on that. However, what is required s that man keeps it under control, which if he does so, he will save himself from many difficulties. Conversely, if man does not control his anger he is prone to commit innumerable sins. It is anger that gives rise to arrogance; it gives root to jealousy; an angry man bears malice and is also hostile. Hence, man needs to learn how to use this innate tool of anger for his advantage and protect himself from its abuse and nasty consequences.\n\nA FEW ANTIDOTES\n\nHereunder follow a few prescriptions and antidotes to ‘diffuse’ one in the rage of anger. May Allah Ta’ala grant us the Divine ability to implement these when we are placed in such situations, Āmin.\n\nA) RECITE TA’WWUZ - When faced with a situation of anger and excitement, the first thing one should do is act on the directive that Allah Ta’ala has given in the Qurān:\n\nوَإِمَّا يَنْزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ نَزْغٌ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ\n\n“(O Rasulullah) If a provocation from Shaytan provokes you, then seek refuge in Allah.”\n\n(Surah Fussilat – S.41, V.36)\n\nThat is, recite,\n\nأَعُوْذُ باِللهِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيْمْ\n\n“I seek refuge in Allah from the dejected devil.”\n\nThe devil has provoked you, but you have sought the refuge of Allah, so Allah will preserve you from its evil consequences.\n\nB) SIT DOWN OR LIE DOWN – The next thing to be done when angry is to follow the advice of Rasulullah r. It is an unusual but psychological procedure. Rasulullah u advised,\n\n“If you feel the rage of anger in you then, if you are standing, sit down. If the feeling persists in that posture, then lie down.” (Abu Dāwud, Vol.2, Pg.316, Maktabah Ramāniyyah)\n\nC) THINK OF THE POWER OF ALLAH – Yet another method to counter anger is to say to oneself,\n\n“Suppose Allah was to be angry at me in the same way I am angry at this man, then what will become of me?”\n\nWe are told in a hadith that Rasulullah r came across Abu Bakr t scolding his slave. He was blaming him harshly. According to a version, Rasilullah r said,\n\n“Remember, Allah has more power and authority over you than you have over him. You use your authority to hurt him but Allah has more authority over you.”\n\nD) GET ALLAH’S HELP WHEN YOU NEED IT THE MOST – It is recorded in one of the previous Divine books that Allah Ta’ala has mentioned regarding an angry person,\n\n“Remember me in the time of your anger and I (Allah) will consider you at time when I am in full fury.”\n\n(Ihyā Ulumiddīn Vol.2, Pg.219; Dāru Misr Littibā’ah)\n\nE) KEEP SILENT – Sayyiduna Ibn Abbās t has reported Rasulullah r to have said,\n\n“When you become angry, remain silent.”\n\n(Ihyā Ulumiddīn Vol.2, Pg.219; Dāru Misr Littibā’ah)\n\nBy remaining silent, calm and sedate, one will be in complete control of one’s mind and senses thus allowing one to act in correct measure.\n\nF) REMEMBER THESE PHRASES - Next time, before getting angry or while one is in a fit of anger, one may well consider the following wise sayings-\n\n“Anger Is A Very Valuable Thing So Don’t Lose It!”\n\n“For Every Minute You Are Angry, You Lose 60 Seconds Of Happiness!”\n\nMay Allah Ta’ālā protect us from the snares of Shaytan and nafs, and may He allow us to attain His Divine pleasure through our anger, Āmīn.\n\nWASWASA (EVIL WHISPERS & DOUBTS)\n\nANSWER TO THE SECOND QUERY: From the outset we should understand that Allah Ta’ala has given Shaytan the power of whispering into the heart of a person. It is for this reason that we implore Allah’s protection against such whisperings in Surah Nās,\n\n“I seek protection… from the mischief of the whisperer (of evil), who withdraws (after his whisper). He who whispers into the heart of mankind…”\n\n(Surah Nās – S. 114, V. 4-6)\n\nWhilst the evil whispers of Shaytan cannot be heard, its message can be perceived and comprehended by the heart. A golden rule to remember is that, as long as one does not subscribe to these whisperings, (into ones heart), there is no need to become worried and perturbed about them; the whisperings should merely be ignored. In the same note, whilst these whisperings pose a test to mans will-power of restraint, Allah Ta’ālā has provided man with antidotes to secure ourselves from the evil of these injected whispers taking effect.\n\nA FEW ANTIDOTES\n\nA) OCCUPY YOURSELF - Among the numerous divine prescriptions of shielding oneself from waswasas (whisperings), one such technique is to busy oneself in some task when one gets them. One cannot get rid of them by simply desiring them to go away, hence one should occupy himself in some activity. Along with that, one should constantly recite the undermentioned supplication recommended by Rasulullah r for removing these whisperings. The supplication (dua) is as follows:\n\nاَللَّهُمَّ اجْعَلْ وَسَاوِسَ قَلْبِىْ خَشْيَتَكَ وَ ذِكْرَكَ وَ اجْعَلْ هِمَّتِىْ وَ هَوَايَ فِيْمَا تُحِبُّ وَ تَرْضَى\n\n“O Allah! Make Your fear and remembrance the obsession of my mind and divert my will and courage to the performance of deeds that please You.”\n\n(Al Hizbul A’zam)\n\nIt is the disposition of man that his mind is always occupied and never without thoughts. His hands may be doing something but his mind is thinking of something else and continuously receives diverse thoughts. Therefore, we must implore Allah Ta’ālā via this Dua that the idle thoughts we receive be replaced by Allah’s remembrance and fear.\n\nB) DOUBTING ALLAH AND ISLAM - Sayyiduna Ibn Abbas t has stated that if the Shaytan casts an evil scruple in anyone’s heart, and thus causes skepticism about Allah Ta’ala and as to which is the religion of truth, he should in a soft tone recite the following verse:\n\nهُوَ الْأَوَّلُ وَالْآَخِرُ وَالظَّاهِرُ وَالْبَاطِنُ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ\n\n“He is the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden and He is All-Knowing about everything.”\n\n(Surah Al Hadīd, S.57, V.3)\n\n(Ma’āriful Qurān, English, Vol.8, Pg.305; Maktaba-e-Dārul-Uloom Karāchi.14 )\n\nC) DIFFERENCES AMONGST THE SAHABAH t - Someone asked Rabi Ibnul Khaitham about the shahādah (martyrdom) of Sayyidunā Husein t. He sighed and recited the verse:\n\nقُلِ اللَّهُمَّ فَاطِرَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ عَالِمَ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَادَةِ أَنْتَ تَحْكُمُ بَيْنَ عِبَادِكَ فِي مَا كَانُوا فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ\n\n“O Allah! Creator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the unseen and the seen, You will judge between Your servants in that which they used to differ.”\n\n(Surah Zumar - S.39, V.46)\n\nAnd thereafter said, “Whenever you have a doubt about the mutual differences of the noble Sahabah t, do recite this verse.”\n\nAdditionally, Tafsir Ruhul Ma’ani reports this statement and then says,\n\n“This incident serves to teach us the best etiquette with regard to this issue, and this is something one should always bear in mind.”\n\n(Ma’āriful Qurān, Vol.7, Pg.570)\n\nD) SAFETY AGAINST THE CLUTCHES OF SHAYTAN - In the undermentioned verse, Allah Ta’ālā commands His Nabi r and the the Ummah to seek protection from the evil insinuation and instigation of the Shaytan, to commit sin, to confuse one and to enrage his temper where he loses control over himself.\n\nوَقُلْ رَبِّ أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ هَمَزَاتِ الشَّيَاطِينِ  . وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ رَبِّ أَنْ يَحْضُرُونِ\n\n“Say O Muhammad r, ‘O Allah! I seek your protection from the whisperings of the Shaytān, and, O my Rabb, I seek Your protection that they (the Shaytāns) approach me (because they always approach with evil).’”\n\n(Surah Mu’minun – S. 23, V. 98)\n\n(Al Jāmiu Li Ahkāmil Qurān – Qurtubī, Vol.12, Pg.154; Dārul Hadīth, Egypt)\n\nMay Allah Ta’ālā allow us to recite these supplications constantly, and may He occupy our minds with His fear and remembrance, Āmīn.\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl.
