  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThere is a conflict of opinion amongst the scholars on whether to pay Zakat on personal jewelry or not? What are the sources of both opinions and why do they regard others opinion to be less credible? I would like a scholarly discussion on this topic as it is very unclear for the public. \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere is no conflict of opinion amongst the Hanafi scholars in the necessity of Zakaat on personal gold and silver jewellery. The Zakaat should be paid on the value of the actual gold and silver. There is a view of Imaam Shaafi’ee [ra] that Zakaat will not be pain on personal jewellery.\n\nThere are various Ahaadith in which Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] instructed the Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhu] to discharge Zakaat on personal jewellery. Please refer to I’elaa-su-sunan vol.9 pg.59 (Darul Kutub; Ilmiyah). All the Ahaadith are mentioned therein.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
