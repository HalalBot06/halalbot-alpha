The word Wazifa literally means amount. The word is generally used as a descriptive noun for specified wages, gifts, specific recitals, etc. Allah Ta?ala has mentioned in many places in the Qur?aan the recitals (Wazifas) of many prophets at the time of their difficulties. Such recitals are significant and beneficial in removing one from similar difficulties.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Mullah Ali Qari (R.A) has commentated that plucking of the facial hair is haraam (prohibited) for a woman with the exception of moustache or beard hairs, if any woman is unfortunate enough to be troubled by these. (Mirqaat Vol.8 Pg.295; Ashrafiyyah). However, if the eyebrows have become so dense that it is unseemly for a woman and incites abhorrence in her husband, it is permissible to trim it to a more appropriate and normal size. (Ahsanul Fataawa Vol.8 pg.76; Zakariyya Book Depot)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. It is permissible to use any hair removing cream which does not have any Haraam ingredient in it to remove unwanted hair under the armpits and below the navel.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Nikah performed during a female experiencing menses is valid. However, if the spouses plan to live with each other immediately after marriage, it is advisable to adjust the date against the time of her periods to facilitate immediate intimacy between the spouses as the resistance against intimacy may not be effective.%0D%0A%0D%0A5.
