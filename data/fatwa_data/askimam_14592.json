  "answer": "QUESTION\nrespected brother in Islam,\nassalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatu,\n \n I'm really confused about a serious problem in my personal life and I really appreciate ur help.\n \n   i met a convert online, he was a priest for so many years but he converted to Islam 3 years ago mashallah he was so sincere in embracing Islam. dad and i even bought many Islamic books for him and sent it to US. he was very happy about dad's gift and he called him to thank him personally.\n \n  actually this brother told me whats in his heart that he wanna marry me coz i was a good sister to him who can help him to be a better Muslim, he wanted to call dad about that. but i told him that he has to come to my house to ask my hand in the appropriate way he really wanna do that but he has this huge debt with the government that he can't really pay because of his unsettled financial status, so he can't get a passport at all...\n \n  i don't care about the material things as much as i care about the islamic heart thats all what i want in my future husband to be a good muslim and very strong in his belief who's willing to do his best to be closer and closer to Allah my family can't go to the states either, because of the political problem between our 2 countries.\n \n he even performs dawah  and some of westerners has embraced islam on his hand after Allah's guidance. he's still trying to convince his former pastor about Islam and the falsity of Christianity\n \n anyway, he told me that he can move out to Canada for me if i can go there with my family and he'll ask my hand from my father properly there...\n \n \n I'm really confused, I don't know what to do. we wanna be together in \"Halal\" which is marriage. but we don't know how due to the problems i said above.we've prayed alot to Allah swt and inshallah Allah will answer our prayers and be merciful with u. i hope u'll  help us brother in finding a solution for this social problem. coz its really important for us. Thank u a lot for listening. And may Allah reward you for all what u do for islam.assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatu\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nYou should discuss the issue with your father and decide on the best cause of action with Mashwerah (consultation) and Istikharah.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\n Mufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
