  "answer": "QUESTION\nonce I had been to prayer in a mosque and my son was with me, while I was in my salat my son took small book of quran and threw to play in air he is 3 yrs old ..please tell me wat shud I do know.. wat is the proper way to read namaz and please tell me dua in order..and when ever I make wudu and start to read namaz my wudu breaks by wind again if I make wudu again it breaks please tell me how to keep my wudu its happens almost every time I don?t understand how to keep my wudu atleast till I finish my salat and can I break my fard salat in the middle if my wudu breaks..\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Your son is not responsible as he is too small. You should make Istighfaar (seek forgiveness) and ensure that it doesn?t happen in the future.\n\n2. You should avoid eating foods which causes excessive gass and you could also seek medical treatment. If your case is so severe that one entire Salaat time passes and you do not get enough time to perform your Salaat because of passing wind, then you would be classified as a Ma?zoor (excused person). You will then have to make a new Wudhu at the start of each Salaat time and your Wudhu will not break by passing wind. You should refer your case to an Aalim to get the detailed laws concerning a Ma?zoor.\n\n3. Kindly find attached, ?How to perform Salaat?.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
