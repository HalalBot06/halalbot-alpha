  "question": "I was wondering about the exact definition of a 'nocturnal emission' that necessitates Ghusl",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSometimes, when I wake up, I notice a small drop of semen on my private part. Is this a nocturnal emission according to Islam? Do I have to do Ghusl for it? There is no actual sperm, its just a very small drop of clear semen, and this happens often. I'm not sure of the exact definition of a 'wet dream' or 'nocturnal emission'. Please tell me their exact definition accoriding to Islam and what exactly needs to happen for me to have to do a Ghusl when I wake up. Jazak Allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The discharges at being aroused and orgasm are different. The first one\nis Mazi and the second is Mani. Mazi comes out gradually and increases the\npassion while Mani comes out with force and satisfies the passion. Upon the\ndischarge of Mani, Ghusl terminates. The discharge without climax will be\nMazi and does not invalidate the Ghusl.\n2. The fluid after urine is Wadi, not Mazi. The ruling of Wadi is the same\nas urine wherein Istinjaa (washing the private parts) will suffice.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
