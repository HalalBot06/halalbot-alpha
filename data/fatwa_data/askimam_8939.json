  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) I am unmarried and go to work. I dont have a lot of expenses, So who should I give rest of my salary, My father or my mother. My father also has job and is a bit greedy about money matters. So what should I do with my money? 2) and If I give 33% salary in sadqa every month and if my father stops me to do that then what should i do? should i stop doing that if my father doesnt want me to do this?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe do not know if you are a male or a female. If you are a female and you are being supported by your father, then it is not permissible for you to work. If you are a male, then in principle, you have an independent Shar?ee right to manage your own monetary issues. You will be within your Shar?ee right to give any amount of charity from your earnings.\n\nHowever, if your father disapproves of your action, you may stop giving charity as it is not compulsory to do so. You may save the money and offer it to your mother or father with the intention of charity. You will get double reward for that, charity and maintaining ties.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
