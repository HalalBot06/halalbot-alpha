  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMaking up of Missed Salats\n\nOnce after I have prayed my Maghrib Salat I was going for a official meeting. On the way I felt some stickiness in my underwear, and realized that my salat might not be valid. So I decided to repeat it after my meeting. However the meeting continued till Isha time and I could not repeat the Maghrib Salat on time. . 2) On another occassion, I was in another town with my wife, and we were far way from my relatives house. I could not find a suitable place to keep my wife and pray Asr Salat. So we decided to goto my relative house. Just when we reached my realtives house, the Maghrib Adhan was heard and I could not pray Asr Salat on time. I want to know what is the make up for these Salats. JazakaAllah Khair\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah has made five daily Salaats compulsory upon the believers. He has fixed times to perform those Salaats. If Salaat is performed at its fixed time, then it will be called Adaa and if it is performed out of its fixed time, it will be referred to as Qadhaa.\n\nRegarding Qadhaa, there are a few points:\n\n1. To specify which Salaat you are making Qadhaa of, e.g. I am performing Qadhaa of Salaatul al-Dhuhr of January 1.\n\n2. If a number of Salaats were missed, the order of the missed Salaat should be mentioned, e.g. Bakr missed dhuhr on Monday and Asr on Tuesday, when Bakr makes Qadhaa, first he must perform Dhuhr of Monday, then Asr of Tuesday.\n\n3. If one is unable to specify which Salaat Qadhaa he is making, then it will suffice that he state before every Qadhaa Salaat that this is the Qadhaa of the first remaining missed Salaat.\n\n4. The Salaat will have to be performed in accordance to what was Fardh on him at the time when he missed the Salaat, .e.g Zaid was at his house where he did not perform his Dhuhr Salaat. In this case, when he makes Qadhaa, he will have to perform 4 Rakaats, however if he missed Dhuhr while on a journey, then he will perform two Rakaats.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
