  "question": "Can a person, who doesn't have a beard, do tawbah for apostasy?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYes, any person can do so.\n\nTawbah is between man and His Creator. At the time of Tawbah, an individual should be truly sincere, have a sense of remorse within him and promise Allah Ta?ala that to the best of one?s ability he will not return to that sin. After Tawbah, he should make a concerted effort to mould his life according to the injunctions and dictates of Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
