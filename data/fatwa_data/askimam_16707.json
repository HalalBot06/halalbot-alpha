  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know if it is allowed to pray alone under the following circumsatnces:\n\nI work in a software company. Alhamdullilah, I pray with jamaat inside the company premises. However, I may need to come on Saturdays and Sundays. In that case, there will be no muslim brothers coming to office on weekends. the nearest mosque is around 4 kilometers from the company. So, it will be 8 kms to and fro. I have a bike. Still, it would be difficult to travel to masjid. I go to masjid on fridays.\nIs is permissible based on the above conditions to pray alone? Please reply asap.\n\nÂ \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nTo perform salah with Jamaat is emphasized. The reward of performing salah in Jamaat is increased twenty-seven times.\n\nYou should try your level best to perform salah with jamaat in the nearby musjid. If you are unable to do that and perform salah by yourself, the salah will be valid.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
