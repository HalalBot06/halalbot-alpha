  "question": "Do women have to make up fasts they miss during Ramadan due to their periods? During these 7 days, do they have to give away any money every day against the missed fasts?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have heard if a person does not fast, they have to feed one person during this period. Do women in their periods fall in this category? Out here, I?m not sure how to locate any hungry/needy people, and it would look odd to send money overseas to feed a person for 7 days. Pls advise.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is no feeding of needy persons required. All that is required is to make one Qadhaa fast for each fast missed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
