Hazrat Abu Hurairah radiallahu anhu narrates that once Nabi salallahu alahi wasallam said to Bilaal radiallahu anhu at the time of fajr salaat,Oh Bilaal inform me of that action you carry out in islam in which you hold high hopes of its reward,indeed i have heard your footsteps infront of me in jannah.So Bilaal radiallahu anhu said that i have not done any such action except that whenever i made wudhu during the night or day i would perform salaah with it.\n\n[Saheeh Bukhari V1\\2 P60 Daarul Fikr] \n\n2.
