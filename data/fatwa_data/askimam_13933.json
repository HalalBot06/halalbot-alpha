  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissible for one to marry his step sister’s daughter if the step sister is from different mothers but same father.?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe ‘step sister’ you refer to is actually his real sister (consanguine sister). She is a Mahram relation to him. Hence, her offspring will be regarded as his Mahaarim as well.\n\nHence, he is not permitted to marry her.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
