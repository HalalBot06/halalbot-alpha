  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. I read in Fazail-e-Amal that Shaikh Akbar Teahreer (R.A.) said (not exact words) one should have a shaikh or a really pious person whom he should always obey because a company of pious person helps you become pious too. And you should do what ever he tells you to do. You shouldn?t listen to your nafs but do what he tells you and completely surrender yourself to him. But the part that I don?t understand is that isn?t this shirk or riyakaari? Shouldn?t one do everything for Allah and not for a pious person or anybody? It is on page 34 in the Fazail e Tableegh portion (urdu version). Please explain. 2. Is this practice allowed to do in Islam: when someone moves in a new house they do a Quran Khuwani in which they call people to finish one quran? The purpose for this is that before moving in the house, Quran is read and so there will be brakaah in the house, or something like this. They don?t think it is necessary but good to do? Is this ok to do? It this mustahib, sunnat or just biddat or what? ( I have seen this being done in Pakistan)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn the Holy Qur'aan Allah Ta'ala mentions: \"O people of Imaan, Obey Allah,%0D%0AObey His Rasool, and those in charge of your affairs.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Shaikh Kaamil (true and perfect spiritual guide) falls under the%0D%0Acategory of \"those in charge of your affairs\". Hence obedience to him is%0D%0Anecessary. This obedience is undertaken for the sake of Allah Ta'ala, and%0D%0Afor no other reason. Hence it is not shirk. The sign of this is that if the%0D%0AShaikh tells you to do something that is clearly against the command of%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala, then you and should disobey him. This itself shows that this%0D%0Aobedience and submission is for Allah Ta'ala, otherwise the obedience would%0D%0Ahave been unconditional.%0D%0A%0D%0ALet us illustrate by way of an example. The Shariah enjoins strict obedience%0D%0Ato the parents. Now if the mother tells her son to recite the Qur'aan for%0D%0Aexample, it may appear that he is doing it to please his mother, but it is%0D%0Astill Ibaadat, because obedience to the mother is Ibaadat.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe purpose of this obedience to the Shaikh is training. Initially to train%0D%0Aourselves in carrying out the Islamic injunction, we need to be put under%0D%0Apressure and train ourselves under an expert. Once we are trained, then we%0D%0Atake it a step further and refine our intention. So in the beginning stages,%0D%0Athe intention will not be one hundred percent perfect, but this will slowly%0D%0Adevelop to perfection.%0D%0A%0D%0ATake the example of Salaah. In the Ahadith we are taught that we should%0D%0Acommand our children to perform Salaah when they are seven years old, and%0D%0Ahit them at the age of ten. This is the training phase of the child's life.%0D%0AHe will perhaps only perform the Salaah because of the fear of his parents.%0D%0AHowever, once it becomes his nature to perform Salaah, he will then develop%0D%0Athe correct intention. If this was shirk or riya, then the Hadith would not%0D%0Ahave given this directive.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe custom of Qur'aan Khuwaani is something that has no basis in the%0D%0AShariah, and hence should be shunned. There should not be any special%0D%0Aarrangements made for the Khatam of the Qur'aan. Any individual can at%0D%0Aanytime read any portion of the Qur'aan, and it will definitely be a source%0D%0Aof Barakah, but no special customs should be attached to this.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Imraan Vawda%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
