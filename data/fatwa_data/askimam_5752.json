  "question": "What is the ruling on the Dua after Salaah. That is the recitation of aloud Dua.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo make Du'a in any form (loudly, softly, collectively, etc.) and any time%0D%0A(before, after Fardh Salaat, etc.) is permissible. While there are%0D%0Asubstantiations for the different forms and times of making Du'a, Shari'ah%0D%0Adoes not restrict the making of Du'a in those forms or times not%0D%0Aspecifically substantiated in Shari'ah. At most, making Du'a is permissible%0D%0Aand an act of great virtue and merit. It is not permissible to project a%0D%0Apermissible act as compulsory as this is projecting a wrong view of the%0D%0AShari'ah, thus, causing distortion of Deen.%0D%0A%0D%0ATo regard the collective Du'a after Fardh Salaat or Sunnah Salaat as%0D%0Acompulsory will be Bid'ah as that projects the incorrect image of Shari'ah.%0D%0A%0D%0ALoud Du'aa after Salaat is established and proven by many Ahaadith. It is%0D%0Anarrated that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) should say after Fajr%0D%0ASalaat, 'O Allah, I ask you for beneficial knowledge, accepted actions and%0D%0Apure sustenance.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another Hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) told Mu'aadh ibn%0D%0AJabal (Radhiallaahu Anhu), 'I love you, so say after every Salaat, 'O Allah%0D%0Aassist me in your rememberance and gratefulness.'
