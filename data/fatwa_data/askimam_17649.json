  "question": "Can we swim in a pool where Non Muslims also swim",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nQ 1, i just want to know can i go for swim in a pool wherein  Non muslims also took part, i feel uneasy bcoz they dont follow thaharath,& i think some may urinate in a pool itself bcoz its tendency that as soon man come in water he feel to go for urine pass,\n\n\nQ 2, whats ur comment on terror attacks, any fatwa reg this, bcoz i am allways teased by my non muslim  frns in my company ,as i have a beard on my face,\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n1) If the pool you are swimming in is 10x10 Ziraa’ (± 5x5 metres), then such a pool is regarded as a large area of water. If impurity falls into such a pool or a person carrying impurity jumps in, it will not affect the purity of the water. Hence, to swim in such a pool will not render one impure.\n\n (Fatawa Mahmoodiyya vol.2 pg.172, Farookiyya)\n\nIf the effects of the impurity are evident, then to swim in such a pool will render one impure.\n\nHowever, we discourage using public swimming pools due to other un-Islamic or unethical factors in it. If there is a mixture of males and females or males swimming with the undergarment only, it will not be permissible to swim at such a pool.\n\nوالغدير العظيم الذي لا يتحرك أحد طرفيه بتحريك الطرف الآخر إذا وقعت نجاسة في أحد جانبيه جاز الوضوء من الجانب الآخر لأن الظاهر أن النجاسة لا تصل إليه ) إذ أثر التحريك في السراية فوق أثر النجاسة..... وعن أبي يوسف رحمه الله أنه لا ينجس إلا بظهور أثر النجاسة فيه كالماء الجاري .\n(Al-Hidaayah vol.1 pg37,Shirka)\n\n \n\n2) Islam is a religion of humility, simplicity and submission. Whatever we are commanded with, is the divine commandments of Allah Ta’ala and the pure teachings of Rasulullah (salallahu alaihi wasallam). Rasulullah (salallahu alaihi wasallam) who was the most perfect of human was sent as a guide for all of mankind and if we follow his teachings we will be successful in this world and in the hereafter. If we study his teachings closely, we will find that it clearly promotes peace, unity, justice and guidelines on how to live in harmony.\n\n\nAs Muslims we are not allowed to lay an attack on the enemy, unless it is the  last resort. If we do engage in war, then too, we have to abide by certain etiquettes (e.g. not to attack women, children and those who are not actively taking part).\n\n \n\nDuring the time of the Prophet (salallahu alaihi wasallam) for many years the Muslims were tortured and prosecuted by the Makkans. They emigrated to Madina Munawarah and years later conquered Makka Mukarramah. After the conquest, the Makkans expected the Prophet (salallahu alaihi wasallam) to retaliate and to take revenge, but to their surprise, he forgave them and instead, restored their honour and dignity.\n\n \n\nYour friends terming you as a “Terrorist” because you are practising on your religion, is a result of their poor understanding of the teachings of Islam. You should not feel offended by these allegations, but rather, make dua that Allah guide them and do your part by remaining firm upon the Islamic teachings. \n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
