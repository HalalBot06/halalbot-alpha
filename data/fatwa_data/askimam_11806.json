  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) Many people say that we should not sleep or eat between Asr and Maghrib is it true coz they say it is a time of Ibaadat...My husband does not take tiffin along and he stays hungry till he comes home at 6:30.We live in united states and here maghrib is at 8:20 in the evening,so what shall i do can i serve him dinner when he comes home and can i accopany him too.2)What is the Meaning of Benazir,Moid,Hamid,Tabassum,Haania,Ayesha, Khalid,Jawwad.Jazakh Allah!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There is absolutely nothing wrong with eating after Asr. In fact, many ahadith show that in the time of Nabi (sallahu Alaihi wasallam) supper was eaten before maghrib.(See Fathul Bari Vol.2 Pg.160, Umdatul Qari Vol.5 Pg.197)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn those days only two meals were consumed, one late morning meal and another just before or just after maghrib. If one needs to sleep then there is no problem in sleeping after Asr. The narration that prohibits sleeping after Asr is extremly weak.(Asnal Mataalib No.1513, Ma'rifatut Takkirah Vol.4 Pg.2421, AL-Kaamil Vol.4 Pg.145 etc) Not only is it permissible for you to eat with him, it would be preferred for you to do so. It leads to greater love between the spouses.%0D%0A%0D%0A2.Banazir- Unique, Matchless; Moid- Pronounced \"Muayyad\" meaning Strong, one who has strong support; Hamid- Praised; Tabassum- Smile; Haania-Happy, Ease; Ayesha- One with a good life and in a good condition; Khalid- Everlasting, Stable; Jawwad- Generous%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
