  "answer": "QUESTION\nAslam-o-Aliakum Missed Fard salat Neeyat? I have recently realised the truth about Life. I am trying to complete my missed fard salats. I am 26 yrs old please tell me from which age I should count my missed salats i.e. 14yrs or 12 yrs? Also What is the neyat of missed salat, as I offer one missed one with each regular one. Also for Isha one, do I need to offer missed Witr as well Jazak-Allah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFirstly, we wish to embrace this opportunity to congratulate you on\nrealizing the truth of life. May Allah Ta'ala grant you steadfastness and\naccept you for the service of his Deen.\n\nIn principle, Salaat becomes obligatory once a person becomes Baaligh\n(physically matured). However, if an individual does not become physically\nmatured at the age of 15, the Shari'ah considers such a person as Baaligh\n(physically matured).\n1. If any obligatory Salaat is missed, Qadhah (to cover up) is necessary\n2. If a lot of Qadhah Salaat have accumulated, the intention for Qadhaa will\nbe, 'O Allah! I am performing my Qadhaa for Fajr ...' (For all Salaats,\nsimilar intention will be made)\n3. If one misses the Witr Salaat, Qadhaa is necessary (Tahtaawi pg.239;\nQadeemi)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
