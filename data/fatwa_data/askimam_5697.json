  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaam, 1) I am a very sad mother. I got this 23 year old son doing nothing at all and staying home all the time reading Islamic books. He doesn?t work although he can find work easily. He doesn?t help his dad maintain the property. He doesn?t help me doing shopping or anything. He always goes late for namaaz although he has a beard and wears a jabbah. I can?t get him married because he has no qualification of deen or dunya. Sometimes I think to throw him out. But then again I am scared of losing him. He can find a job in the mosque but he doesn?t so please advise me on how to help him. 2) I heard from a Pakistani business women that bibi khadija RDA was a successful business women. Does that mean that women are allowed to do business? 3) What is the ruling of jokes? Some people say something and then they say ?no, I was only joking!? what does Islam say about this? Sorry for being so long, I have greatly benefited from your site.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We advise you refer to Mufti Ismail Kachholvi and seek his guidance in%0D%0Athe matter of your son. He may be contacted at at 71 Fairbank Road,%0D%0AGirlington, Bradford BD8 9JU Telefax: 01274-822538%0D%0A2. Yes, a woman is allowed to do business with the condition that it is%0D%0Awithin the confines of Shari'ah and in accordance with the rules of Hijaab.%0D%0A3. It has been proven in many Ahaadith that Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) joked with the Sahabah. But it has also been prohibited to joke.%0D%0AIn Tirmidhi, a narration of Hadhrat ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) is%0D%0Areported wherein it has been prohibited to joke. Imam Nawawiy (RA) has%0D%0Areconciled between these two types of Hadith in this manner and said that%0D%0Aexcessive joking which will result in the heart becoming hard or keeps one%0D%0Aaway from the rememberance of Allah Ta'ala, or it may lessen the dignity and%0D%0Adegrade one. All these will be included in the prohibition. However, if it%0D%0A(joking) is void of these and is done to appease and to make someone happy,%0D%0Athen it will be Mustahabb.
