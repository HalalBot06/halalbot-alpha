  "question": "Regarding wudu being rendered makruh due to being miserly with water....",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am aware that if one has enough time and sufficient water to wash ones limbs thrice (in wudhu) then it is makruh not to do so. However is this still the case if one does wudu, not with the intention of offering salat or praying Qur'an but, with the intention of sleeping in a pure state? i.e. If one did wudu in order to retire to bed but one only washed all fard parts once despite having the ability to perforn it fully, does this render the wudu makruh?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf one fulfilled only the Fardh of Wudhu before retiring to bed, that is\npermissible. The Wudhu will not be Makrooh.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
