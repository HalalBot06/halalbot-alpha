  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am aware of the fact that wife?s Iddat starts as soon as Husband give her 1st Divorce. Q.1. If husband give the 2nd and/or 3rd Divorce at the end of 1st month of her Iddat, would Iddat be extended for extra month as well? Q2. If Husband gives the 2nd and/or 3rd Divorce after the completion of her Iddat then would she have to sit in Iddat again because of 2nd and 3rd Divorce? or can she carry on with her normal life after her 1st Iddat.? Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the husband gaver one divorce and after that he never took the divorce%0D%0Aback and gave the 2nd and 3rd divorce then she has become haraam upon her%0D%0Ahusband. However if the husband gave only a 2nd divorce during her iddat%0D%0Athen the husband still has a chance to take his divorce back. This woman's%0D%0Aiddat started after the first divorce and will finish after the completion%0D%0Aof her 3rd menses even though the husband gave the 2nd or 3rd divorce during%0D%0Athe iddat.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf the husband gave a divorce and then took her back during her iddat, and%0D%0Athereafter gave a divorce again then she will have to commence her iddat%0D%0Aagain.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever if the iddat was completed and the husband never took the divorce%0D%0Aback during this time then the Nikah between the husband and wife no longer%0D%0Aremains. Therefore if the husband gave another divorce it will not count,%0D%0Aand she will not have to sit in iddat again. She can move on with her life%0D%0Abecause he is no longer her husband.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
