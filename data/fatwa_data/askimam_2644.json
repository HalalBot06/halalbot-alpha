  "question": "Salam, What is your position on scholars that have shortened or no beards?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\n'For Muslim males to grow a beard is Waajib (compulsory), and to let it grow\na fist length is Waajib. Without any Sharée reason to cut or shave is Haraam\n(totally prohibited). He who does so is a Faasiq (sinner) and to shorten it\nless than a fist length is Makruh Tahrimi (near Haraam).' Dari Aur Ambiyaa\nKi Sunnate, Mufti Saeed Palanpuri.\n\nIf a Faasiq person (one who openly violates the Laws of Allah Taãla e.g.\nshaving the beard, etc.) leads the Salaat, his Imaamat will be\nMakrooh-e-Tahrimi (close to Haraam). However, following such an Imaam does\nnot invalidate the Salaat and does not necessitate to repeat the Salaat.\nPeople responsible for appointing such persons will bear the sin.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
