  "question": "Does Nabi(saw) himself appears in grave?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen we are buried in grave, we are asked to recognize the face of Nabi(saw). Does Nabi(saw) himself appears there? Many people are buried in grave at a time around the world. If Nabi(saw) himself appears in the grave, then how it is possible for him to appear in every grave at a time if he is not everywhere. 2. Hindu burns the dead bodies. Do they also undergo the hardship of grave becasue they do not bury dead boy in grave. Do they also face the questions as we Muslims face int the grave? What about Jews and Christians? 3. What happens to the soul of kaafir after death and muslims who die with imaan and those dying without imman. where did they go. Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] doesn?t himself appear, but an image of Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] is presented.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The assumptions that Hindus will not be punished because they bury their dead is irrational and illogical in relation to the concept of the punishment of the grave since even those who are buried normally, their bodies will decompose in a matter of months. Shall we deduce from this that after their bodies decompose, they no longer receive any punishment, etc.? The fact of the matter is that the punishment is given to the soul. Thereafter, whether the body is there or not, there makes no difference. Yes, they will also be asked the same questions that the Muslims will be asked. It is narrated in a Hadith that two angels will come and sit in Qabr, and they will ask questions. As for a belier, he will answer them. As for a Munafiq and non-believer, he will not answer them.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. When a Mumin passes away and proceed to the Aakhirat, angels come to him from the sky, their faces are like the sun. they will have shrouds from the shrowds of Jannah on them ad they will sit next to him. The angel of death then will come to him and make salam upon him. He will sit by his head and will call out, ?Oh pure soul, come out to forgiveness which is from Allah and his pleasure.?%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd when a Kaafir passes away and proceed to the Aakhirat, angels come to him from the sky. Their faces like pitch black. They will sit next to him. The angel of death then comes and sits by his head. He will call out, ?Oh evil soul! Come out towards the anger of Allah. The grave of a Mumin will be one of the garden from the gardens of Jannah and for a kaafir, he will be from the pits from the pits of hell.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
