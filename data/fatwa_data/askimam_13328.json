  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it true that once a woman starts wearing a Jilbaab, she should always stick to only this dress?\n\nAssalamualaikum, I have heard many people say that once a woman starts wearing a Jilbaab, she should always wear it and cannot switch to any other outfit even if that other outfit covers whole body and is loose (such as pants and a long loose blouse and Hijaab). Can I wear the Jilbaab only when my inner garments are not fit for going out (such as having short sleeves) and wear the Jilbaab only when necessary? I would be grateful if you could clarify this point as it causes lots of confusion for me. Thanks Was Salaam\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn principle, a woman should wear such clothing that are not attractive, and it covers and conceals her entire body, her colour, form and shape. If a woman wears a long loose dress that is not attractive in colour and that dress covers the form and shape of the body, then the dress will serve the purpose of the Jilbaab.\n\nIf the dress is attractive in colour or is also fitting size, then such a dress will not serve as a Jilbaab. Generally, the dress of a woman is attractive.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
