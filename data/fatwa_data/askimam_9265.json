  "question": "Trimming the hair by the ears and following sequence of Surahs in Salaah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nEspecially at the left and right hand side of the face i.e. near the ear and eyes can we trim a little bit to make it even. Also whether in Namaz should we have to read surahs in the same sequence as in the quran or we can read surahs in any sequence i.e. can we read Surah Nas in first rakat and surah falak in second rakat. For Sajda Sahu should we raise our finger after Tashud and before saying first salam.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The jurists explain that the beard should be equal to one fist all around and that the beard starts from the jawbone. However, it will be permissible to trim a little by the ear section in order to grow the beard evenly.\n\n2. It is necessary to observe the correct sequence of the Surahs in Salaat. It is Makrooh to intentionally recite Surah Naas in the first Rakaat and Surah Falak in the second Rakaat. However, if a person changes the sequence of the Surahs it will not necessitate the performing of Sajdah Sahw and the Salaah will be valid. (Raddul Muhtaar, Vol. 1, Page 404, Ahsanul Fataawaa, Vol. 3, Page 444)\n\n3. One should lift ones finger in Tashah-hud whether it is before or after the first Salaam in Sajdah Sahw. (Raddul Muhtaar, Vol. 1, Page 376)\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf"
