  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamaualikum, when we enter a bathroom, we read the dua, and there by we cant do any form of zikr until we come out and read the dua again, but in present days we have attach bathrooms, in which we have both th etoilet as well as the washroom, when do we have to say the dua to enter the toilet, and whendo we have to say the dua of leaving the toilet, coz problem arises when we have to do wadhu inside the bathroom. pls explain in detail.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person forgets to read the Du?aa before entering the toilet, then the Du?aa should be read in one?s heart, not on the tongue. However, if the toilet and bathroom are combined, then before entering the actual place of toilet, one may read the Du?aa verbally, on condition one is not unclothed. (Fathul Bari vol.1 pg.197; Daarul Qur?aan).\n\nHowever, it will be best if the Du?aa is read before entering. There is no Du?aa for entering the bathroom before taking a bath. If one enters to relieve himself, then the following Du?aa is recited, ?Allaahumma inniy a?oodhu bika minal khubuth wal khabaa-ith?.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
