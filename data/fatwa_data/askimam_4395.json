  "question": "I start crying when I read/hear Quran or when I hear the name of Allah!",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamOalaikum! Dear Imam, Everytime I hear someone reciting the Holy Quran, or when I hear the name of Allah (s.w.t), tears go running off my eyes. My heart becomes very soft. What is it?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah describes the qualities of His pious servants in the Quran that they\nhave the fear and consciousness of Allah and upon hearing the Quran, their\nhearts become soft. You are fortunate to be chosen from among such people.\nWe humbly request you to make dua to Allah that He chooses us also among His\nchosen ones. (Ameen)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
