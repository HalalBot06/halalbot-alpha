  "question": "Would talking about a person, behind there back,without inslutling the person, but discussing problems and situations about that person,is that backbiting?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI will have the opportunity to have sex in my dreams and will stop myself, thinking that its real life, because im saving myself for marriage. Than other times in my dreams I will have sex realizing its just a dream .What does it mean when I have dreams like this? Another dream that I had, I was spiderman (comicbook superhero) I was swinging along on my web and fighting the badguys., then another dream, I was superman (comicbook superhero) and I was fighting doppleganger (supervillian, an evil version of superman) and I only had half my strength, and was protecting innocent civilians and fighting the villain and also using my smarts to beat him, because the villain was double my strength. What do these dreams mean? If a good muslims becomes old and gets alzhimer desiese,(or someone else who gets amnesia) and cant remember anything and dies , and when the angels come to ask his soul the questions, would he rememeber? As in would he have his memory as if he was young again so he can answer them? What are all the questions that we will be asked from the day we die till we make it into heaven (inshallah)? Will there be all the same questions for the believers and non-believers? Is it haaram to feel bad for non-muslims who get harmed and killed, in general? I feel sorry for people because im a pretty sensitive guy.Thank You , May Allah bless you all.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is not permissible to speak anything evil of a person behind his back.\nThat will be Gheebat, which is prohibited and is a major sin. However, if\nthe discussion is based on attending to the problem and in search for a\npossible solution, then that should be without despising the person.\n2. All the dreams in reference are Shaytaani dreams. You should be in the\nstate of wudhu before sleeping, recite Aayatul Kursi and four quls. Think\nabout Allah and death and sleep while making Zikr of Allah.\n3. Allah Taala will deal with every person according to his condition. That\nis not for us to judge. However, every believer is asked three questions in\nthe grave, who is your Rabb (Lord), b) what is your religion, c) about\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)\n4. To feel bad when any human or animal is hurt is a sign of Imaan. We must\nhave compassion for the fellow creation of Allah Ta'ala.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
