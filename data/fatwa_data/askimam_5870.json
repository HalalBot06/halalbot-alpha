  "answer": "QUESTION\nI had committed fornication in the past and i have repented from that sin. My question is that do i have to marry a girl who also committed fornication in the past. what does the ayah number 3 of surah nur say about fornicator can only mary a fornicator. I have heared that we are not suppose to talk about our sins. When i get married, do i have to tell my wife about my past life and the sins like zina that i have committed. Even if she doesn't ask, do i still have to tell her. jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen a Muslim has made sincere Tawbah, with all its conditions, namely, he\nstops the sin immediately, secondly, he is remorseful of the sin and\nthirdly, he repents and makes a firm resolution not to commit the sin again,\nthen he is as if he has not committed the sin. Therefore, he will not be\ntaken to task for his deed.\n\nThis Aayats refers to a fornicator who has not made sincere Tawbah and is\nstill committing immoral and indecent acts. Therefore, the rule applies to\nsuch a person. Therefore, he will marry his type, i.e. fornicator. All the\nchildren of Aadam (Alayhis salaam) are sinners, and the best of sinners are\nthose who repent.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
