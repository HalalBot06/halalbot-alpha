  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamoalaikum mufti sahab! Kindly advise, what should be done if one is praying farz in home and mother talks of some less important thing during prayer. For example, while i am praying farz/sunnah in my room, my mother says, switch off the light after you are done, or i have kept money here, bring this and that. I have explained this politely to my mother that she can say this after I am done, but she doesnt cares and ignores its importance. Kindly advise what should I do, if she talks to me when I am praying next time?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf your mother addresses you whilst you are engaged in Salaah, ignore her altogether. After Salaah go up to her and very kindly and polietley enquire what she said- even if you know what she had said. Perhaps this would ensure that she does not address you whilst you are in Salaah.\n\nWe suggest before you commence your Salaah, inform her that you are about to begin your salaah and ask her if any chore requires urgent attention. Attent the chores first and then perform your Salaah- time permitting.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Moulana Emraan Vawda"
