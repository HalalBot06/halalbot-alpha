  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamu Alaikum\n\n\nIs it necessary to a married person bath after physical relation?\n\nIf I wash whole body without hair is it acceptable in Islam? if not than if i wash my hair like wudhoo is it ok ...\n\nPlease advice me what will i do..\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nThe compulsion to take a bath after physical relationship with one’s spouse depends on the extent of the relationship.\n\nIf there was intercourse (whether there was emission of sperms or not) or there was emission of sperms (even if there was no intercourse) it will be necessary to take a full bath. The entire body from head to toe has to be washed. It is also necessary to rinse the mouth and nose.\n\nIf there was no intercourse or no emission of sperms, external of intercourse, then it is not necessary to take a full bath. If any part of the body got soiled with madhi (pre-coital fluid) then that must be washed and wudhu should be performed to perform salah.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\n \n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
