  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease can you suggest a dua for my parents. They are trying to sell their business but no one seems interested. People come like the business but never return. My dad has advertised everywhere and response to the ad has been great but no one seems to buy it. Can you please suggest something to sell the business because it has now started to effect my parents health.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah is Razzaq. Whatever He does is full of wisdom and Hikmat. Therefore, advise your parents not to be hasty. Allah will send the appropriate buyer at the appropriate time. Recite Ya Baasitu and Yaa Waasiu after every Salaah. Inshallah, Allah will open up the way for them.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai\nStudent: Darul Ifta"
