  "answer": "QUESTION\nif a woman is displeased with her husband regarding sth that he did, how should she handle it so as not to be ungrateful? Does she have the right to show it to him by ignoring him(still serve him, but not talk a lot or joke)to avoid a dispute?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis depends on the severity of what the husband actually did. It also\ndepends on the individual, the environment, times and the understanding that\nboth spouses have.\n\nSometimes, ignoring the husband will work for some, but not for others and\nsometimes ignoring the husband may even be detrimental and make the problem\nworse. It is best for the individual to use his/her discretion considering\ntheir understanding amongst one another.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
