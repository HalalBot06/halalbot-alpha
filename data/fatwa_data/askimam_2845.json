  "question": "I had a dream recently about death while on hajj",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have recently had a dream in which I am preparing to go to Hajj in the following year, I am then told by someone that I am going die while on this trip to Hajj, I look at myself in the mirror and start to cry saying that I am too young to die as I am only 18. I was hoping you would be able to help me in understanding what this dream means.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOur purpose of life is to attain the pleasure of Allah Ta'ala by being%0D%0Aobedient to Him in every way possible and also securing His bounties and%0D%0Afavours upon us after death through Jannah (paradise) which offers the%0D%0Agreatest opportunity to meet our Beloved Creator, Allah Ta'ala.%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore, death should be seen as a bridge that makes a Beloved (Allah Ta'%0D%0Aala) meet his beloved (obedient servant). Death is a reality and is%0D%0Aimminent. A believer should always be conscious of death, irrespective of%0D%0Abeing young or old and make necessary preparations for it. Hajj is indeed a%0D%0Avery auspicious Ibaadat and if one passes away dyring Hajj, he%2Fshe is a%0D%0AShaheed and will get the reward for Hajj till the day of Qiyaamat.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllaah Akbar! What a great virtue and may Allah grant the writer this%0D%0Ahonour, Aameen. Nevertheless, the dram could also mean the death of the Nafs%0D%0A(spiritual upliftment) which is the purpose and accepted signs of Hajj.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
