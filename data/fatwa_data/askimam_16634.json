It will be considered as your actual salary was the amount after deductions. The pension pay out is regarded to be a gift from the company.\n\nNawadirul Fiqh 1/326 Maktaba Darul Uloom Karachi\nFatawa Mahmoodiyya 16/391 Jamia Farooqiyya Karachi\nAhsanul Fatawa 7/35 H.M.Saeed\nAp ke Masail 6/212 Maktaba Bayyinat\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
