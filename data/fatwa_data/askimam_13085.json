  "answer": "QUESTION\nA friend of mine has hired a nanny, a 20 year old Muslim girl, to live in her house & help her take care of her kids, while she goes to college etc. She is leaving the nanny to take care of her kids when she goes for 2 weeks to take care of her ill Mom. The nanny does not observe purdah for the husband. How do I tell my friend that this is wrong? She trusts her husband.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWith tact explain to her that no matter how much reliance she has on her husband, he is human and Shaitaan is ever present. He runs in man like ones blood and is always waiting for an opportunity to inject his poison. Nabi (Sallalahu alaihi wasallam) has mentioned that whenever a man is alone with a woman, then the third one present is Shaitaan.(Sahih Ibn Hibbaan Vol.12 Pg.399)\n\nRemind her of the many marriages that have been broken because of the husband getting involved in an affair with a woman working with him or for him.\n\nAsk her if her marriage is worth risking for the convenience of having a nanny looking after her children? Ask her if she is prepared to risk the wrath of Allah?\n\nMake dua that Allah opens her heart\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Husain Kadodia\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Ml. Imraan Vawda"
