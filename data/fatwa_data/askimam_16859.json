  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nHello, I am a Buddhist, however I believe in God as the creator of all things and beings but created by no one, has no earthly origin or connection. I believe that as the creator of man and nature, he is full of mercy for mankind and all beings created by him. He provides for each one his share of food and happiness. As the judge of the universe, he rewards virtues and punishes sins according to his laws of justice. He stretches forth his hands and assists the good in moments of difficulty or danger. He punishes the wicked with misery and misfortune. One may sometimes escape the punishment of the law or the condemnation of public opinion but one can never escape the fair judgment of Heaven. Heaven is a moral God standing on the side of truth and justice. Is there any way that is Halal for me to court a Muslim girl?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAs Muslims, we believe in the Oneness of God (Allah) and his 99 attributes, one of which is justice. Our belief in the Oneness of Allah can only be completed if we believe in Him as He wants us to believe in Him. For that, Allah sent his messengers in every time and era. Muhammad (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) is the last Messenger of Allah. He taught us who is Allah and how we should believe in Him. Muhammad (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) also taught us the ordains of Allah. As Muslims, our faith can never be complete without believing in Muhammad (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) and following the ordains of Allah as shown to us by him.\n\nCourting in Islam is prohibited by Allah. Allah is moral and commands morality. Allah condemns vice and evil. Courting is a vice and leads to immorality. A just Allah who is moral will never permit such an evil. Furthermore, a female Muslim cannot marry a non-Muslim. Our sincere advice to you is to do some sincere soul searching and study Islam. Study the great prophet of Islam, Muhammad (sallallahu alayhi wasallam). It is only then the light will beam in front of you to explore the heights spirituality. Your e-mail is an excuse and way to lead you to the ultimate truth. You may communicate with us for further assistance on Islam at admin@askimam.org\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
