  "question": "1. Musa (AS), Isa (AS), Adam (AS), all have died. They are alive in their graves.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Musa (AS), Isa (AS), Adam (AS), all have died. They are alive in their graves. But while on Miraaj, Nabi(saw) met all of them in the heavens. Some are in first heaven, some are in second heaven etc. Where are they actually, in grave or in heaven. What about Nabi (saw)? Is he in the grave or heaven? 2. Is sleeping allowed in Masjid?. Do Sahaba used to sleep in the Masjid?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The Ambiyaa [alayhimus salaam] are alive in their graves. Allah Ta?ala caused their souls to go and greet Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam]. According to some, it could also be that Allah Ta?ala caused their bodies as well to appear there for this occasion. (Fathul Baari vol.7 pg.210). Isa [Alayhis salaam] is present in the sky and alive, while Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] is alive in his grave. (al-Muhannad)\n\n2. A person sitting in I?tikaaf is allowed to sleep in the Musjid. Similarly, a Musaafir can sleep in the Musjid if he has no other place to stay. For any other person to make a habit of sleeping in the Musjid, with any need, would be Makrooh. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyah vol.15 pg.222). Ibn Umar [Radhiallaahu anhu] would sleep in the Musjid, as he had no other place to stay. (Ibid; Faydhul Baari vol.2 pg.49)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl.
