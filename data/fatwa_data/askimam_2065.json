  "question": "Regarding the function of Meelad, you have termed it a bid'at.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nTo substantiate this, you have rightly indicated that the Blessed Companions did not hold such gatherings. Therefore, using this argument, is it safe to assume that the annual Ijtema is also bid'at because it was not a clear command of The Holy Prophet Muhammad Sallallaahu Alaihi Was Sallam nor was it the practice of the Blessed Companions.?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShari?ah had not mandated a particular format for Da?wah work. Religious education, Tabligh, Jihaad, etc. are different ways of discharging this collective responsibility and they are all important in their own right. The popular format chosen for a given function is an administrastive matter. For example, today our religious institutes offer instruction for 10 months a year, six days a week, six hours a day. They also have exams at predetermined intervals. This arrangement has been found useful through experience, but it was not used at the time of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and one cannot find any evidence supporting it in the books of Hadith.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, since this arrangement is not considered mandated by the Shari?ah, but it is only an administrative matter, therefore, it cannot be considered a Bid?at. The format adopted by the Tablighi Jamaat is also of this nature and does not need evidence in its favour as long as it is not considered as mandated by the Shari?ah. However, for our understanding, it is sufficient to note that all prophets (Alayhis salaam), including Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), had gone out to invite the people to the greatness of Allah. This is an answer given to a similar question by Mufti Taqi Usmani.%0D%0A%0D%0ATo claim that Tablighi Jamaat accords no importance to Qur?aan is an erroneous notion reinforced by non-conformance to Usool (principles) and laxity by some of its members which cannot be used as a basis to come to a general conclusion. In fact, a lot of emphasis is given to the Qur?aan as regularly mentioned in the Hidaayat (guidance) talks delievered daily in the central Markaz Nizaamuddeen that every Haafidh should recite no lesser than 1 Juz. Brothers are also encouraged to teach one another, those who know how to recite, to teach those who don?t. In Fadhaail-e-Aamaal itself, is a complete chapter dedicated to the virtues of reciting, learning and teaching the Qur?aan.%0D%0A%0D%0AConcerning the Mehfils of Dhikr in the manner you describe, many Ulama, regarding it to be nothing more than an exercise to gain concentration, have taken it to be permissible. It should be noted, however, that many evil practices accompanying these Mehfils (when held by Barelvis) do in fact constitute Bid?at, such as belief that Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is present in the gathering, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
