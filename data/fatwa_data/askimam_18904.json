  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nI am in quite a problem and if you can answer as quick as possible it would be very much appreciated. On the tiles in my bathroom which surround the bathtub, there are designs on them which resemble very much the name of allaah. So what i did was that i took some paint which is not really the same color as the designs and as the name of allaah is spelled as 'la' 'la' 'ha' in arabic, i took some paint and made a dot underneath the two 'la' to make it look like the letter 'ba' so now it reads 'ba ba ha', would this be correct or will it still read the name of allaah because remember, the designs are imprinted into the tiles and the dots are made outside the tiles. Am i committing kufr by having napaak water splash onto the name of allaah as i take baths and the water splash onto the tiles. If this is not correct then what shuold be done as i rent the place and cannot remove it? Also the tiles on the floor have some desings that resemble the name of allaah if looked in a certain angle, what should i do? And if the design only has the letters 'la la ha' without the letter 'hamza/alif' will it still be considered the name of allaah?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIn order for us to determine the shar῾i ruling regarding the tiles, please send us the pictures of the tiles.
