  "question": "What does the various positions of Salat represent?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nI have heard a few theories in this subject, one of being that the postures\nrepresent the servitude of the different creations of Allah. Thus Qiyaam\nrepresents the trees, Rukoo, the four legged animals, Sajdah, those animals\nwho crawl and Jalsah, the mountains. However, I have been unable to document\nthis from authentic sources due to lack of reference material.\n\nPrimarily, Salaat is as it is because it has been taught to us in this way.\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) stated \"Perform Salaat as you see me do\nso'' (Mishkaat). Trying to grasp the symbolic meaning of Salaat, although\nunderstandable , can have no impact on ones Imaan, therefore not deserving\nof great concern.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
