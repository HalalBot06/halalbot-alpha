This is the ideology of the west that the prospective spouses should have relationship with each other so that they may come to know each other.\n\nAccording to the Shari?ah, it is prohibited for a man to have any contact with any strange-woman. We suggest you communicate your intentions to your parents and take their guidance on the issue.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
