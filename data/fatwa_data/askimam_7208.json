  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. my father owns land and he has not yet distributed among his children. He told us to pay zakat for our share of the land. There is no income from this land should i have to pay zakat on such land 2. I bought few pieces of land over the last few years and I am planning to do business on this land. and presentl the nald is not generating any income for me. Should i have to pay zakaat on such land 3. If i have fixed deposits in bank should i have to pay zakat on such money every year.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) In principle, Zakaat is not necessary on personal belongings. Therefore, if the land is not bought for resale purposes Zakaat is not neccessary. If your father intends to hand over the land to his children he should rather disrtibute it in his life time in order to avoid any possible dispute and confusion after his death.\n\n2) No, there is no zakaat on this land.\n\n3) If the fixed deposits amount to the nisaab (stipulated amount of zakaat) zakaat will be neccessay.If the fixed deposits do not amount to nisaab ,zakaat will not be neccessary on these deposits.These amounts will have be checked annualy to see if they amount to nissab or not. We wish to point out that the interest accrued from the fixed deposits is not permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
