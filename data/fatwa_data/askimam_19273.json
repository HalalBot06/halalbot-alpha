  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDoes a mustahadha have to change her pad for every salaah?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nIf a Mustahadha’s pad, cotton wool, etc. remains clean, salah may be performed with the same pad. If however, if the pad is soiled with blood then she should keep a separate clean pad which she should wear at the time of every new Salah and remove it after salah and wear it for the next salah.\n\nIf the pad is soiled during the salah, then there is no harm and the salah will be completed. The pad should merely be disposed off appropriately and a clean one worn at the next salah. Hence, every salah should commence by wearing a clean pad. After salah, it is not necessary to see whether she bled or not because even if she did bleed, her salah will still be regarded as complete.\n\n(Al Hadiyyato Linnisa – Maulana Muhammad Ebrahim Palanpuri, Pg. 34, Islamic Book Service)\n\nThe above mentioned book is very beneficial in detailing the different scenarios a Muslim woman is generally faced with. We recommend it be studied by every female.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
