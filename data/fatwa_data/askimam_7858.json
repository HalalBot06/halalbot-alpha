  "question": "is it permissible to work for the Australian Tax Department. 2. has $2000 (Nisaab is $1500), has this money for less than 1 year, have to pay zakaat on that money after 1year is completed",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have 2 questions. The first is on behalf of my brother. He would like to know if it is permissible for him to work for the Australian Tax Department. The second Question is regarding zakaat ? If a person has $2000 (Nisaab is approx $1500) but has had this money for less than 1 year, and he also has a debt of $5000, does he have to pay zakaat on that money after the year is completed or does he have to first pay off the debt. The person in question has never had above the nisaab amount for more that a year and has never payed zakaat before. Also, in this situation, is it permissible for this person to receive zakaat. Jazakallah Khair. May Allah reward you for your time.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\na) It is permissible.\n\nb) In principle, the conditions for paying Zakaat are, a) A person should possess the complete amount of Nisaab, b) The wealth must be free from debt, c) One entire lunar year must pass. If these 3 conditions are found, then only Zakaat will be necessary. In the enquired case, one entire lunar has not passed and the money is indebted, hence, Zakaat is not necessary.\n\nc) It is permissible for this person to receive Zakaat. However, there are many such people who are much less fortunate than this person. it is advisable to offer Zakaat to the people most inneed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
