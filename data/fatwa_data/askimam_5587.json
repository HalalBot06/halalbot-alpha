  "answer": "QUESTION\n2) Is it true that its the duty of every Muslim to invite 40 people to Islam each day? 3) Is it true that you cannot get married in first 13 (or 21) days of Saffar? I have been told these things. Please give evidence so I may correct these people. Jazakallahu-khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If in a place, all the condition for the validity of Jummu'ah exists, and\nthen for some reason a Salaat has been missed in the past 40 days, it will\nstill be permissible to read Jummu'ah there.\n2. Every Muslim has a moral duty to invite towards whenever the\ncircumstances are conducive to it. There is no fixed number of times. If the\nsituations allows, one should call towards Islam for there is immerse reward\nin this. However, simply ignore the notion of a fixed number being\ncompulsory.\n3. One can get married on any day of the month of Safar. Ignore such\nsuperstitions.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
