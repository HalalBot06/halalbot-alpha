  "question": "What is the punishment for zina,listening & dancing to music in the hereafter?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI found many interpretations of the punishments but I need clear answers. Some people say that it is ok to dance and sing and listen to music, but I feel it is not alright. What are the reasons for not dancing and listening to music?Are their any physical problems from dancing and singing?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs a Muslim, one does not require any rational explanation for any command or prohibition of Allah or His messenger (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). However, experience has taught that these are rarely without apparent reason, singing and dancing being no exception. One of the most logical reasons is the inescapable fact that music and dancing incite passions and carnal desires thus leading to Zina. %0D%0A%0D%0AIn the Quran, Allah says: \"And go not even near to adultery, for it is an obscenity and a most evil way.\" (Israa: 32). Another reason mentioned in the Quran itself is that it creates pride and obstinacy towards the commands of Allah. -\" And among the people are those who purchase useless speech, unknowingly causing deviance from Allah's path, taking it to be insignificant. For him awaits a disgraceful punishment. When our signs are recited before him, he turns away in arrogance, as though he hears not, like one bearing a weight in his ears (blocked). Give him tidings of a painful punishment.\" Luqman: 4,5. Useless speech has been explained by a number of Sahabah (R.A), among them Ibn Masood, as music or singing. (Tafseer Ibn Kathir Vol 3 Pg 543 Darus Salaam). Another reason mentioned in Hadith is: \" Music causes Nifaaq (hypocrisy) to grow in the heart like water causes crop to grow.\" (Mishkaat with Mirqaat Vol 9 Pg 134 Ashrafiyyah). Aside from these, there are probably a number of other reasons that in depth research may reveal. Concerning physical problems, it is common knowledge that music, blasting at high volumes, as is the trend nowadays, causes severe damage to the eardrums. People in the medical field may be better informed in this regard and should be able to elaborate on this topic.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Bilaal Cassim%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
