  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni gave my wife one divorce then we found out she is pregnant,does this divorce still count?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nThe divorce in state of pregnancy is valid. You may reconcile with your wife depending on the type of divorce. If you give divorce with an express word directly meaning divorce  then one talaq e raj’ee will take place. In that instance m you may verbally resp;revoke the divorce by saying for example, I take you back as my wife. If you issued a divorce with a word having an indirect meaning of divorce with the intention of divorce, for example you say “go away” and you intended divorce, then one talaq e baa’in takes place. In this instance the Nikah terminates. You may reconcile with her by having a reperformance of Nikah.\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla knows best\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
