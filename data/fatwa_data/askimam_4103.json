  "question": "Shia Sunni Marriage, Dreams, and Soap",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRecently a girl was married to a boy whose parents at the time claimed that he was a sunni but right after the wedding the boy says he is shia, although he does not pray the shia way or say the kalima their way etc... they now have a baby to, is this marriage valid? Also what is the interpretation of seeing the same male in your dream often. I also had a dream that i was marrying this male and when it came to sign the nikah papers it turned out to be something else he signed. Also can one use soap that has animal by-products or eat cheese with the animal by-products, some of the sheikhs here say that you can do so because it is no longer the same animal product anymore. Your help is greatly appreciated.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The dream indicates success and prosperity.\n2. At the time of the Nikah, since it was apparent that he was a Sunni, the\nNikah is valid. We have to first ascertain his beliefs before a ruling can\nbe issued.\n3. Soap with animal by-products may be used. Kindly explain to us the\ningredients in cheese in order to issue a ruling.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
