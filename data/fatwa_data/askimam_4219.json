  "question": "out of controll sexual thoughts",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nEsselamo Elykum, I often have out-of-control sexual thoughts-ideas which i cannot avoid and as a result of those sexual thoughts I experience a release of (usually small quantities of) sexual fluids (whether mani or mazi). Does ghusl becomes obligatory after the release of such fluids even if there has been no erection (and of cource no ejaculation)??? Does ghusl become obligatory if there has been a little bit of erection but no ejaculation??? This problem causes me trouble in being regular for Salat and during Fasting. I try to recite \"subhan Allah\" and \"alhemdulillah\" when such thoughts come into my mind but usually the release of fluids occurs before i get control over the thoughts. Does the release of fluids in this way break the fast immediately? Does the ghusl only become obligatory if there was ejaculation or atleast erection? Jazakallah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe emission of a fluid during erection is Mazi. That does not invalidate\nghusl or fasting. It only invalidates wudhu. The soiled portion around the\nprivate parts and undergarment should also be washed before performing\nwudhu.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
