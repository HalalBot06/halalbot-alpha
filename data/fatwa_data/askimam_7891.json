  "question": "Is it permissible to become a stockbroker?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA broker is an agent middleman who, for a commission or fee, bargains or negotiates between his principle and a third party for the purchase or sale of goods, real estate, services, stocks and bonds, insurance and commodities without having title and usually without having possession of the property or rights involved. (Encyclopaedia Britannica vol.ii pg.291)\n\nFrom the above, we can understand that a broker involves himself in many different transactions. Only those deals which are Shari?ah compliant will be permissible. the same will apply to a stockbroker more specifically. If he is only involved in those type of companies and shares that are totally in conformity to the laws of the Shari?ah, then only will it be permissible to become a stockbroker.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
