  "question": "In Beralwi mosques Salat-o-Salam is recited before Azan. Further the first Kalma is also recited three times after Fard prayers. Can it be called Bidat ? Can such a action be called a Sin?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo recite Salaah and salaam or any Durood Sharief specifically before Azaan has not been proven from any hadith and therefore will be contrary to the Sunnah. However, to read Durood after Azaan and thereafter make dua is proven from the hadith. Everything we do should be according to the Sunnah, (Fataawa Mahmoodiyah vol.15 pg.87).\n\nTo make Zikr after Farz Salaah or any other time is meritorious. However, to deem the recitation of the 1st Kalima thrice, specifically and necessarily, will be a bidah and a sin.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
