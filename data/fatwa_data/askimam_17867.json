  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissable or is it \"Bidah\" to visit a Wali's grave recite yasin and place your forehead and hands on the grave (like in sajda) and to ask the wali to make dua on your behalf for whatever you require. I refer to Badsha Peer, Soofie Saheb etc.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nIt is advisable to visit the graveyard as much as possible as this reminds one of death and inspires one to prepare for ones final abode in the hereafter. When visiting any grave, it is advisable to make Dua (supplication) for the deceased. When making Dua, one should ask directly from Allah Taa’la and not from the deceased. However one could ask Allah Ta’la through the Waseela (intermediary) of the deceased.\n\nMaking Sajdah to a grave with the intention of showing honour, greeting etc is Haraam. If it is done with the intention of Ibaadat (worship) it will be Shirk (polytheism) and Kufr (disbelief). However to recite Quraan by the grave is permissible.\n\n{Fataawa Mahmoodiyyah v3 pg231}\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
