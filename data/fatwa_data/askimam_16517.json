I am totally confused please tell me?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is stated in the Quran; “ Allah T a’ala sent among the unlettered ones a messenger (Nabi Sallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) from among themselves reciting to them His verses ‘purifying them’ and teaching them His book”. (62:02)\n\nIn the above verse Allah Ta’ala mentions three missions of Nabi (Sallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). One of the missions of Rusullulah (Sallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) was purification of the soul. Nabi (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) is reported to have said;\n\nVerily in the body of man is a peace of flesh. If this is pure, then the rest of the body will be pure, and if this peace of flesh is impure, then the rest of the body will be impure. Alas, it is the heart”.   (Muslim, Vol.1. Pg.28. Kutub Khana Rashidiya)\n\nA person should choose a spiritual guide for spiritual development. \n\nAllah Ta’ala Says;\n\nO you who believe! Fear Allah Ta’ala, and be with ‘those who are true’ (in words and deeds). (09:119)\n\nIt is important to choose a guide with whom one has compatibility. This can be determined by staying in his company for a few days. Keeping this in mind a spiritual guide should preferably be a scholar (alim) of deen and maintains the following characteristics;\n\n·        He is upright and pious.\n\n·         A person who stays in his company, inculcates concern for the hereafter and desire for doing good actions.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
