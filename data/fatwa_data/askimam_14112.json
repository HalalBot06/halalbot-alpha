  "answer": "QUESTION\nI live in USA, working in a big store where all the time music is going on which  is the normal routine in almost all the stores in USA/WESTERN WORLD, we offer our prayers in a room but the voice of music keeps coming in the room, is it ok to read namaz over there b/c there is no other space available.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWhen performing Salaat, one must look for a place where one can concentrate. If after searching for a suitable place for Salaat and no alternative is found except a room where music can be heard, then one will be excused.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
