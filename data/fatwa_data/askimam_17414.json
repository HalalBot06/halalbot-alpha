  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n\nMy question is what is exactly durood shareef, the one which we recite in salat is durood ibrahimi. I want to know which one is durood shareef.\nI am asking this question because i want to do a wazifa and for this i have to recite 11 times awal and akhir durood shareef.\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nDurūd is a Persian word used to refer to Salām and Salawāt upon Rasūlullah صلى الله عليه و سلم. Sharīf means honorable and exalted and in this context is used as an adjective for Salām and Salawāt. This is mainly done as a sign of respect as normally done for things related to Dīn similar to a person referring to the Qur'ān as Qur'ān Sharīf, Bukhārī Sharīf, or K‘abah Sharīfah etc. It can refer to any Durūd and is not specific to any one type of Durūd. \n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nMl. Yusuf bin Yaqub,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\nDarul Iftaa"
