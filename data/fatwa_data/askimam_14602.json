This is the true spirit of Deen and Islam. You are conscious of Deen and the guilt of your action has brought you this far. Your sincerity will take you a long way Inshallah. According to Shariah, your husband cannot wear a condom or withdraw without your consent. If he does, he is violating your rights of being fulfilled during intercourse. You should discuss the issue with your husband openly. There is no need to divulge your sin to him. Both of you could agree for you to take oral contraceptives instead of your husband using condoms or withdrawing. This should be agreeable to your husband as he does not want to have children and it will also serve to grant you fulfillment from his side. This ruling is based on the principle of lesser of the two evils. It is not correct to unnecessarily practice birth control, but the sin of adultery etc is worse. You should also make Tawba to Allah and do not resort to anything un Islamic. Allah is Rahman & Rahim, he is most forgiving. Do not despair; turn to him for forgiveness & solutions for your problems.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
