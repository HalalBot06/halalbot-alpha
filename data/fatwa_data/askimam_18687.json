  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it haraam to become a professional wrestler?\n\nthis is not a joke! it's something serious iv'e been thinking about for a long period of time now! i'm muslim, pray 5 times a day and read the qu'ran at least once or twice a week which is good for me because my schedule in life is very busy! so could you please let me know, i dont want to go on in life doing something wrong! thank you for your time!\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIn principle, wrestling is a Mubāh (permitted) act. It was common amongst the Sahabah (radiyallahu anhum) to wrestle with one another.\n\nOn the occasion of Uhud, Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) turned back many youngsters from participating. It was mentioned that Rafi’ ibn Khadeej (Radiyallahu anhu) was a good archer, hence, he was permitted to join the army. Another young Sahābi by the name of Samurah bin Jundub said “if I wrestle Rāfi’, I will overthrow him”. They both wrestled and Samurah overthrew Rāfi’. The both were then permitted to join the army.\n\nHowever, due to wrestling being an entertainment and commercialized, there are multiple un-Islamic factors prevalent in such gatherings, e.g. a) Music, b) exposing of the Satar, c) intermingling of sexes and d) people being unmindful of Salaah etc. Due to the predominance of these and other un-Islamic factors, it will be impermissible for a Muslim to undertake such a profession.\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla knows best\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
