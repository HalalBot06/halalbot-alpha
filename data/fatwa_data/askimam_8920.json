  "question": "a brother always asks for daleel, for example: i told him to read the Quran in facing the Qibla, in tashahud position... etc In this type of case, what approach should be made?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAm i wrong at this position on telling him what to do w/o daleel?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAdvise should be given with total wisdom and humility. A person advising another person should convince him with his character, then if a person offers a Daleel or not, one should be eveready to practice on his/her advice.\n\nNevertheless, the manner of reciting the Qur?aan is one of etiquette. It is not something stipulated in Deen. However, maintaining Adaab when reading the Qur?aan is a great virtue. The procedure mentioned by you is not in any Hadith according to our knowledge.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
