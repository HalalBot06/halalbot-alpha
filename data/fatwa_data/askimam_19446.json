  "answer": "QUESTION\nAre muslims allowed to read english Quran with out wadu?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\nYour question ‘are muslims allowed to read an english copy of the quran...’ could refer to an only english ‘quran’ without the arabic in it. If so, there is a consensus amongst the ulama of the Ummah and in particular the four famous Fuqahaa- Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Shafi, Imam Malik and Imam Ahmad- that publishing such a ‘Quran’ is prohibited. A quran will only be called a ‘Quran’ when there is the Arabic version of the Quran in it. If there is just the translation of it in any other language without the arabic text at all, it will not be permissible to publish it[i].\n\n \n\nHowever, if one does happen to come across a book that contains only the translation of the quran, it will be permissible to touch it without wudhu.\n\n \n\n“If the words of the Quran are more than that of the tafseer then it will not be permissible to touch the tafseer book without wudhu; otherwise it will be permissible as long as one does not touch the words of the Quran.”\n\n(Ahsanul Fatawa vol. 2 pg. 27 H.M. Saeed)\n\n \n\nIn the above mentioned quote, it is stated that if there is more tafseer than quran, it will be permissible to touch it without wudhu, and the translation of the quran that contains no quran will also be in the same ruling as there is no Arabic text.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nSaanwal ibn Muhammad,\nUK\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\n(2011-09-19)"
