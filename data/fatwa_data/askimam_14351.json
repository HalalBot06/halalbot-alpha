  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI need to know if there is any islamic finance business that is permissible, I am not rich to offer house financing or auto financing.  I have read most of your fatwas and honestly everything seems to be haram and allah knows best. This is the only type of business that i enjoy. I would like to know if i purchase other peoples debt can i collect on them for a fee.  \n\nFor example If I purchase 300,000 worth of debt which might invole interest(credit card debt, auto debt) for 20,000. Can I procedd to collect on that. I may only recover 20,000 or may recover 150k-200k. Collections great deal of work. Is this Haram or not\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYour question is not clear.\n\nAccording to our understanding, you will pay the creditor his debt and proceed to collect the debt for the debtor. This is a transferral of a debt and the debtor has to agree. As an alternative, you could serve as a debt collector and charge a fee for that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
