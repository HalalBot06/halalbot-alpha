  "answer": "QUESTION\nAre pork enzymes haram to eat?\n\nI dont beleive so, because enzymes are so very small (smaller than an atom) and a wise person I trust told me that the prophet mohmmad (PBOH) said that \"if the pork weights less than an ounce then it is okay to eat\".\n\nOne of the reason that we don’t eat pork is because it is bad for you right? well pork enzyemes are so small that you would have to get a huge big-high tech. microscope just to see it, and even then it is still not clear! so it wouldn’t affect your body at all.\n\nI want to know if it is okay to eat them? my friend think that all enzymes are haram but it is only a chemical that is use to speed up a reaction. I am a young mulim trying to get answer, can you help me please?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nPork is haram (absolutely prohibited. Pork enzymes are also haram. There is no hadith that states one may eat lesser than one ounce of enzymes.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\n \n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
