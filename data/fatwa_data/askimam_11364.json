  "answer": "QUESTION\ncan anybody take an istakhara out?A person who has verbal relationship with a na_mehram?(who intent to maryy)will the istakhara she takes out be valid? Is it suggested that istakhara should be taken out? Also can u tell me any easy way of doing istakhara?JazakAllah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYes, anybody can make Istikhaara. a person who has a verbal or any type of relationship with a non-Mahram should immediately stop this illegal relationship and repent. The Istikhaara that she will do will be valid. Istikhaara is advised before embarking upon any important, permissible venture.\n\nIf you do not know the Du?aa for Istikhaara or you are finding the suggested method difficult, then merely perform 2 Rakaats of Nafl Salaat sincerely and thereafter beseech Allah for help in whatever language you are comfortable with. Insha Allah, you will be guided.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
