  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nJummah Khutab is in English or in Somali, more over, the random Imams picked for Jummah khutbah is either clean shaved or trimmed beard. There is no Arabic Khutab in the entire city of Minneapolis/St Paul, and all and every Imam is either clean shaved or trimmed, although many of them are hafiz Quran (somalies) and with beautiful Tajbid. In this case, what should I do about my Jummah salat? Do I have to re-do them as Zuhar salat?\n\nOn regular salat in Masjid it is as worse. Mufti Nawal ur Rahman of shariahboard.org chicago, IL, has said, salat behind a clean shaved or trimmed beard (less than 1 fist) is not valid. So in regular 5 times salat, I do pray in jamat 1st, then go behind and re-do my salat. Is this ok?Â  The salats that I pray behind a clean shaved or trimmed behind Imam, can I make Niyah of Umri Kaza salat since I re-do all my 5 times salat, Fajar salat being a home after attending to salat at the masjid.\n\nSomali and Isna followers pray Isha before time comes in according to 18 degree hanafee time. It is always 15-30 min difference. I pray with them in jamat with their time with the intention of Nafal. And then wait 15 more minute and re-do my Isha salat. Can I pray their Isha salat in early time, basically Maghrib time witht he Niyah of Umri Kaza? Looks like if I can continue making the Intention of Umri Kaza for all the 5 times salat, I will have made up all my Umri kaza in 5 years inshaAllah.\n\nMost of our tablighi brothers got feed up and now do not bother who they are praying behind or what time they pray there salat. I am the last one standing. Am I wired or am I doing the right thing?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is wajib to keep the beard the length of one fist and Haraam to shave or trim it lesser than this. It is Makrooh to willingly appoint a beardless Imam. If you are ot in a position to appoint a suitable Imam, then instead of performing salah individually, it will be better to perform the compulsory congregational prayers behind the Faasiq Imam. It will not be necessary to repeat these prayers. The Qadha prayers should be performed seperately.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
