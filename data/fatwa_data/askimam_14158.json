  "question": "If my dad tells me not to read salaat and gets really angry, what am i supposed to do - do i respect him",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf my dad tells me not to read salaat and gets really angry, what am i supposed to do - do i respect him by obeying his order or do i continue to be faithful to my religion by reading Salaat? He says to me that if I did not listen to him there will be no point in me reading salaat because i will not get rewarded for it nor will my prayers be answered. Is this true. I really love reading salaat, but I am finding it really difficult to understand, and thus, respect my parents these days because they are not finding any marrige proposals for me and because  I am upset for this reason my parents do not want me to read salaat any more.  \nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah Ta’ala has made it compulsory upon every mature Muslim to perform Salaat. Our beloved Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] had given the most severe warnings for those who even delay their Salaat, let alone not read Salaat at all. The punishment for this is even more severe.\n\nThe Qur’aan also commands us to treat our parents with respect and honour. If they compel us to disobey Allah, we are not allowed to obey them in that command. However, it is still necessary to respect and honour them. We should also make du’aa to Allah to guide them and make them see the light. If there is an Aalim who is reliable in the eyes of your father, it would be advisable for him to explain to him the importance of Salaat and evils of deterring others from the Deen of Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
