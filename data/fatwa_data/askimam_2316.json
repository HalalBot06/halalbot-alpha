  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Respected Mufti Saab, Is it permissible to make pictures of people and living things on a computer to display on the screen without printing the picture out? Is it also possible to distribute this picture on the internet? Is manipulation of photos on a computer also allowed as long as the photo is not printed out? Jazaka'Allah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPicture frames and photographs of animate objects are not permissible to\ndisplay. Frames having pictures of inanimate objects e.g. trees, mountains,\netc. are permissible.\n- Hadhrat Abu Talha (Radhiyallaahu Ánhu) narrates that Nabi (Sallallaahu\nÁlayhi Wasallam) said, 'Angels do not enter a house wherein there is a dog\nor picture.' (Mishkãt vol. 2 p. 385)\n? Ábdullah ibn Masóod (Radhiyallaahu Ánhu) narrates that Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, 'The people with the most severe\npunishment by Allah will be the picture makers.' (Ibid).\n? Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (RA) narrates, 'I heard the messenger of Allah saying,\n\"Every picture-maker will be in the fire. A life will be created for every\npicture the picture-maker made, and he will be tortured in Hell.\"\nIf you have to make pictures (says Ibn Abbaas) then make a picture of a tree\nor such things which are inanimate.' (Bukhari and Muslim)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
