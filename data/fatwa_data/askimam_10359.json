  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf my father asks me to cut off relationship with his/my relatives (aunts or uncles etc) shall I obey him in doing this big sin? Or shall I keep in touch with them which makes my father angry with me for being in contact with them?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo maintain family ties is an express order of llah, which is replete in the Qur?aan. Allah Ta?ala says, ?And remember when we took the covenant from the Banu Israaeel that do not worship but Allah and be favourable to parents and relatives.?%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another place, Allah Ta?ala states, ?Verily, Allah orders justice and Ihsaan (to be favourable) and to offer to relatives?? In a Hadith Qudsi, Allah Ta?ala states, ?Family ties (Rahm) is from Rahmaan. Whomsoever maintains family ties, I will maintain him and whosoever breaks family ties I will break him.?%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] stated, ?Whosoever loves his wealth to be increased and his life to be increased, he should maintain ties.? In another Hadith, Rasulullah [sallallahu alayhi wasallam] announces a severe warning for a person who severs family ties, he said, ?The person who severs family ties will not enter Jannah.? In another Hadith, he states, ?The mercy of Allah does not descend upon that nation among whom there is a Qaati?e (person who severs family ties).%0D%0A%0D%0AThe importance of family ties is clear from the above quotations. According to Shari?ah, a child must be obedient to his father. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], ?The pleasure of Allah lies in the pleasure of the father and the displeasure of Allah lies in the displeasure of the father. However, if the father instructs the son to do something against the order of Allah, he cannot obey his father in violating the law of Allah. The son should respectfully express this to his father. Insha Allah, Allah will guide the father that his son is responding to him only according to the order of Allah and he too will be granted tawfeq to express submissions to the order of Allah like his son.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
