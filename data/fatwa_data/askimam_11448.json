  "question": "1-Baby name 2-Interest 3-Translating quran 4-Going to Hajj wihout Mehram",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs the name Rafiel and Jamemah an islamic name? Also, if for example, someone has a name Tariq Wahab Ahmed, and his wife when married change their name to Zahida Wahab. Is this permissible? as Wahab is one of Allah's name, (Wahab to be used as a last name.) Also brother i was wondering what is the punishment taking interest, and what was the last word's of the prophet about interest, because i heard an imam talk about his last words involving interest. Brother their alot of people whom are from the arabic descent, translating the quran by themselves, is this permissible, their alot of youngster heading towards such groups and many of the translated meanings do not coincide with our teachings on islam. Mashallah brother your are very knowledgeable and inshallah Allah will reward you for the efforts taken in to help muslims such as myself. I have learnt alot from this site, and inshallah much more muslims will appreciate this tool given from Allah. My mum would like to go for hajj, she is a 40 yr old widow, we cant afford for all of us to go for hajj, we can only pay for her, is it permissible for her to go to hajj without a mehram. Wallaikum-assalam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We were unable to find meanings of those names. Instead of keeping names similar to hose of Kuffaar, one should keep names mentioned by Allah Ta?ala, Nabi [Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam] or normally kept by the Muslims.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. It would be permissible to keep the name Wahaab as it means one who gives generously and is not specific to Allah Ta?ala only. (Ahsanul Fataawa vol.9 pg.60)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Allah Ta?ala has declared war against those involved in interest and Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] has mentioned that they are accursed. There are many other punishments mentioned in the Ahaadith. We are unaware of what is meant by ?the last words of Rasulullah [Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam] concerning interest?.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. In order to translate the Qur?aan and explain its meaning, one needs to be suitably qualified. In addition to this, the commentary given has to coincide with what has been narrated to us by the Sahaaba [Radhiallahu anhum] and Taabi?een [ra]. The majority of these groups propagate beliefs and practices opposed to Islam, thus, one should keep his distance from all such groups unless they are headed by reliable Ulama.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. If your mother doesn?t have a Mahram to do with her for Hajj, she is not allowed to go. She should wait for the opportunity for one of her Mahrams to get the means and make Du?aa to Allah. If Hajj is Fardh on her and she is unable to go right until her death, she will have to make a bequest that Hajj be performed on her behalf from her wealth. (Ahsanul Fataawa vol.4 pg.532)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
