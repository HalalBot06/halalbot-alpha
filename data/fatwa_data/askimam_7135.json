  "question": "Is it permissible to read Quran while in the office, through software Quran (ie. by using computer ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nImam, Is it permissible to recite Quran, through software Quran (ie. by using computer) , while in the office (ie. while wearing shoes, socks and not in Wudhu). Since Ramadhan month is coming soon , I want to spend most of the time spending by reading Quran, also it is easier to read Quran in the office. Because by the time I reach home in the evening (ie after Taraweeh) I will be too tired.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is permissible to recite the Qur?aan without Wudhu. Yes, to touch the Qur?aan without Wudhu is prohibited.\n\nAlso, to recite the Qur?aan as it appears on your computer screen without Wudhu and with shoes on is permissible. However, do not touch the screen without Wudhu whilst the Qur?aan appears on it.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
