  "question": "Assembling a second, third, or fourth jamaat in Massajid for daily salaah. Right or Wrong?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHere in USA, it is very common to find Mussali's in Massajid to assemble a second, third, or fourth jamaat for daily salaah. One of the scholar, who visits our Masjid each year, strictly prohibits the practice. According to him only travelers are allowed to assmble for additional jamaat when the scheduled jamaat for the salaah is over. Please explain in some detail, if it is recommended to either start or join a second/third jamaat or not. Jazakallah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nEvery effort should be made to have one Jamaat for every Fardh Salaat. However, if people do not attend the official of the Jamaat Musjid timeously, they may make another Jamaat outside the Musjid proper as a second Jamaat inside the Musjid proper is prohibited. and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai FATWA DEPT."
