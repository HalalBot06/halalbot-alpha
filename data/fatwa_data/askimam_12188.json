  "question": "What is Quranic guidance on Tran sexuality; Female is getting sex changed to MAN and will marry another female.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam Alai Kum Please advise on what is the Quranic and Sunnah guidance on a very complex circumstance. As you are aware this is the new decadent society in the West and its sickness where Homosexuality, Lesbianism, Trans sexuality and Hermaphrodites are all finding legitimacy. The situation below relates to Trans sexuality: Two females involved in a Un Islamic situation. A. One female says she is a man in a woman?s body and is undergoing sex change to become a ?MAN? B. Second female states she is going to marry the new ?MAN? C. Both state that sex changes are going on in Muslim world and nothing in ISLAM prohibits them from: Â· Sex change (2) the subsequent Marriage and (3) they will adopt children. D. If Quranic proof is provided against it, they state they may Re consider. Please advise on what is Islam?s position on: 1. The sex change 2. The subsequent Liaison\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala has sent given us both the Quran and the teachings of Nabi (Sallalahu laihi wasallam) for our guidance. Refutation of any one of them is Kufr!%0D%0A%0D%0AThe crux of the argument put forward is that since the Qur'an has not clearly forbidden undergoing a sex-change, it is therefore permissible. If this is the case, that whatever is not forbidden in the Qur'an in explicit terms is permissible, then if it is said to them that \"marrying\" an animal is not explicitly forbidden in the Qur'an, hence would they do so?%0D%0A%0D%0ANevertheless, changing the sex, is forbidden in the Quran. Allah Ta'ala clearly mentions in the Quran (Surah 4 Verse 119) that shaitaan will command people to alter the creation of Allah Ta'ala and that those who listen to Shaitaan would have thrown themselves into clear destruction. There exists absolutely no doubt that changing the sex falls clearly under the ambit of \"altering the creation\", infact it could be classified as the worst form of alteration possible. Allah Ta'ala in surah 4 verse 32 also commands the sexes, not to wish for that which Allah Ta'ala has bestowed upon the other gender.%0D%0A%0D%0AThus it should be understood that changing the sex, is Haraam and would earn them the curse of Allah. The female undergoing this Haraam operation will always remain a female and the laws applying to females would fall on her. It is completely Haraam for her to marry a woman, as this would constitute lesbianism, which is Haraam. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMl.
