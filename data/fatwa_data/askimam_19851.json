  "question": "Why do Muslims don’t get baptized whereas they believe in Jesus?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nassalaamu alaikum..\nmy friend asked me a question that \"muslims say that no muslim is a muslim until they believe jesus christ(pbuh) and follow him........if that is true why muslims didn't get baptized?????\n\n \nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu `alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nAs Muslims, we believe in Eesa (Jesus) (Alayhi al- Salaam). We believe that Eesa (Jesus) (Alayhi al – Salaam) is a prophet of Allah (Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala) having reached a very lofty position and status. Belief in the prophethood of Eesaa (Jesus) (Alayhi al- Salaam) is an integral part of Eemaan (true faith).\n\nAllah (Ta’ala) says:\n\n \n\nإِنَّمَا الْمَسِيحُ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ\n\n“The Messiah, Eesa (Jesus) is only but a messenger of Allah” (Al Qur’an, 4: 171)\n\n \n\nAs Muslims, We attest to the original unaltered Torah (gospel of Moses) and the original bible (the gospel of Jesus) since they were revealed by Allah (Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala) to his prophets. However, none of these original scriptures are in existence today, in their entirety.\n\nTherefore, as Muslims, we follow the subsequent, final, and true religion, Islam.\n\nThe concept of “Baptism” is foreign and alien to the teachings of Islam; therefore, we do not practice “Baptism” in Islam.\n\nMoreover, in light of the many contradictions, distortions and errata contained in the Bible, it will not be sensible to follow the Bible and its teachings.\n\nAnd Allah knows best.\n\nIsmail Desai,\nDurban, South Africa\nStudent Darul Iftaa \n\nChecked and Approved \nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
