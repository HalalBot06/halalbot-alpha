You should abstain from consuming such foodstuff. If not Haraam, then these products are at least doubtful. Hence, you should keep away from them.\n\n2. Yes, since it is still in your possession, Zakaat is compulsory on it.\n\n3. If you mean the Zaaidiyah sect of the Shi’as, then your Salaat behind such an Imaam is incorrect.\n\n4. Yes, Zakaat is still compulsory on such jewellery.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
