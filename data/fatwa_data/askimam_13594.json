  "question": "I get yellow discharge frequently, What if I get this yellow discharge for about 6 days before my bleeding starts, and my bleeding lasts for 7 days",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI get yellow discharge frequently. I recently heard that if I get this discharge (yellow) during the days of Haidh (after my 15 days of purity have passed), it would also be counted as haidh, is this true? Even though I have been get this same kind of discharge, sometimes, within my 15 days of purity too?\n\nWhat if I get this yellow discharge for about 6 days before my bleeding starts, and my bleeding lasts for 7 days, will I count the 6 days as part of haidh, and therefore the remaining 3 days of my bleeding as Istihadha?\n\n If I get 7 days of bleeding (that’s when I start counting my haidh days), and after that I get yellow discharge for 3 or more days, will I count my haidh as 10 days?\n\nI am really confused regarding the above, especially since Ramadhan is coming, and I don’t want to miss my Salaats or fasts wrongly.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nTreat this yellow discharge as though you are bleeding. If this occurs within the 15 day purity period, treat it as Istihaadha. If 15 days had elapsed and then you start discharging yellow, regard it as though your Haydh has commenced. This will now lengthen your period of Haydh. Ultimately, other rules and regulations applicable to Haydh will apply to this entire period.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
