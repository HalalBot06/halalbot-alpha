  "question": "What book of Hadith contains the Hadith Quoted by Zakariyah Kandahlawi that dead person will first see the Holy face of the Prophet PBUH?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMaulana Zakariyah Kandahlawi writes in his article, The Beard of a Muslim and its Importance: \"when he (the dead person) is placed in his grave he will first be shown the countenance of Rasulullah (PBUH).\" What book of Ahadith tells us that a dead person will be shown the Holy face of Rasulullah sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam? I am not aware of any such hadith. Thank you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Hadith which Hadhrat Shaykh Zakariyya is referring to in his book, 'The%0D%0Abeard of a Muslim and its importance' can be found in the following books of%0D%0AHadith: Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, Nasaa-ee, Ahmad, Mishkaat.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the Arabic version of the same book, which is approved by the world%0D%0Arenown Shaykh Abdullah ibn Abdul-Aziz ibn Baaz. The translator mentions,%0D%0A'The seeing of the holy Countenance is one of the two views of the eminent%0D%0Ascholars of Hadith.' (Sharh Qastalaani)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe second view of the scholars of Hadith is that all the veils between%0D%0Ahimself (the deceased) and the beloved Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Awill be lifted, whereby the person will see Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam). Therefore, the word 'this' which is used in all these Ahaadith is%0D%0Anot referring to a person who is absent. (Fataawa Mahmoodiya vol.12 pg.104)%0D%0A%0D%0AHereunder are the extracts of the various Ahaadith which you can refer to:%0D%0A1. In the Hadith of Barraa ibn Azi (Radhiallaahu Anhu), these words have%0D%0Abeen used, 'Who is this (man) who was sent to you.' (Ahmad %2F Mishkaat)%0D%0A2. Hadith of Hadhrat Anas ibn Maalik (Radhiallaahu Anhu), 'What do you say%0D%0Aconcerning this Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).' (Bukhari; Muslim)%0D%0A3. In Abu Dawud, Nasaa-ee and Ahmad, the following words are used, 'What do%0D%0Ayou say concerning this man.' (Targheeb vol. 4 pg.364)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
