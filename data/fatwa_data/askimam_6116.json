  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Allah's Messenger (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, \"The perfume for%0D%0Amen is the fragrance is apparent but the colour is hidden, and the perfume%0D%0Afor women is the colour is apparent but the fragrance is hidden.\" (Mishkaat%0D%0AHadith4443)%0D%0A2. Allah's Messenger (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said: Every eye is%0D%0Alustful and when a woman applies perfume and then goes about in an assembly,%0D%0Ashe is like such and such, i.e. an adulteress. (Mishkat Hadith1065)%0D%0A3. The Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said: If a woman applies%0D%0Aperfume, she must not attend the night prayer with us. Ibn Nufayl said:%0D%0AIsha' means night prayer. (Abu Dawud Hadith4163)%0D%0A4. Narrator: Abu Hurayra - A woman met him and he found the fragrance of%0D%0Aperfume in her. Her clothes were fluttering in the air. He said: O%0D%0Amaid-servant of the Almighty, are you coming from the mosque? She replied:%0D%0AYes. He said: You used perfume? She replied: Yes. He said: I heard my%0D%0Abeloved AbulQasim (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) say: The prayer of a woman%0D%0Awho uses perfume is not accepted until she returns and takes a bath like%0D%0Athat of sexual defilement. (Abu Dawud4162)%0D%0A5. The Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said: If a woman uses perfume%0D%0Aand passes the people so that they may get its fragrance, she is so-and-so,%0D%0Ameaning severe remarks. (Abu Dawud Hadith4161)%0D%0A6. The Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said: I do not ride on purple,%0D%0Aor wear a garment dyed with saffron, or wear shirt hemmed with silk.%0D%0APointing to the collar of his shirt al-Hasan (al-Basri) said: The perfume%0D%0Aused by men should have fragrance but no colour, and the perfume used by%0D%0Awomen should have a colour but no odour.%0D%0ASa'id said: I think he said: They interpreted his tradition about perfume%0D%0Aused by women as applying when she comes out. But when she is with her%0D%0Ahusband, she may use any perfume she wishes. (Abu Dawud Hadith4037)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
