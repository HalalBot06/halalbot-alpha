  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have heard in some bayan from authentic person regarding Omar R.A stopping earthquake in Madina munwarrah, and once he wrote letter to river niel when its water was drying and once during qutba in madina his voice reached saria r.a to look behind towards mountain who was fighting with enimies . Also once a jamath of sahabi crossed the sea (or river) with their horses. Please can you provide me ref book for any 1 or all the story mentioned above. I dont doubt on any of the above stories but need to give to my friend who needs proof. Jazakallah qair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The incident of Sayyiduna Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) writing a letter to the river Nile has been recorded by Imaams Abu Shaykh in his Kitaabul Azamah, ibn Asaakir and others. (refer Hayaatus sahaabah vol.3 pg.602)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The incident of his voice reaching Saariya is recorded by Imaams, Abu Nu?aym, Bayhaqi and others. (refer Hayaatus sahaaba vol.3 pg.527-564)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. There are a few stories concurring how the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) crossed the seas and rivers. (refer Hayaatus sahaaba vol.3 pg.603-608)%0D%0A%0D%0A4. As for the incident of the earthquake, perhaps it is the same incident of the eruption of some sort of a volcano that took place in Madinah Munawwarah and Sayyiduna Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) sent Sayyiduna Tamim Daariy (Radhiallaahu Anhu) alone who waved it back into its hole with the action of his bare hands! This has been recorded by Imaam Abu Nu?aym and Bayhaqi.
