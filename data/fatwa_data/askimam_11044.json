  "answer": "QUESTION\nChisty people? Are they Muslim? What is the differnce in their belief? Are they \"grave-worshippers\"? My best friend has received proposal from Chisty boy. What should she do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not clear what you mean by Chisty people. A proper Muslim is one who subscribes to the Aqeedah and believes of ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaa, i.e. the Sunnah way of the Sahaaba [Radhiallahu anhum].\n\nGenerally, the term ?Chisty? refers to a group of Sufis. Their Aqaaid usually subscribes and is in conformity to the Aqaaid of the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaa. They are not grave worshippers. We advise your friend to try and obtain information concerning the beliefs of the boy. By merely being a ?chisty?, we cannot determine his Aqeedah and beliefs. If an when you get this information, you may write to us for a ruling.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
