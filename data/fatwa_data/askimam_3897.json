  "answer": "QUESTION\nThis man and I have been in a relationship for almost three years. He and I have reqreted what happend. Since then, both he and I have tried to stay away from each other. However my parents are pressuring me to get married now. I can not marry another man, since I have had this relation with this man. I have deep feelings for him. I would like to know what I can do to get married to him. Thank you\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the person is not married, then you may propose marriage to him but if\nthe person is married, then you should also consider the implications (many\nnegative factors) of marrying a married person.\n\nFeelings before marriage and within are different. It is often noticed that\nthe prositive feelings before marriage drastically changes into negative\nfeelings after marriage due to circumstances. We advise you first make\nIstikhaara (seek Divine guidance) and make Mashwarah (consult) with your\nseniors about marrying the person. If both Istikhaara and Mashwara are\npositive, then you should appoint a representative to propose marriage to\nhim.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
