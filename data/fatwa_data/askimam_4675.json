  "question": "Is it permissible to break the nikah before rukhsati",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it ok to break the nikah before rukhsati on the basis that I don't feel that my wifr is very beautiful\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNikah is a sacred bond. Among many virtues of Nikah, one is that Nikah is a%0D%0Ameans of an extended family. In view of major implications of a Nikah, the%0D%0Aconsequences of a divorce are equally grave.%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'The most%0D%0Adetestable thing in the sight of Allah is Talaaq.' Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%0AAlayhi Wasallam) also said that the Shaytaan is most pleased when there is a%0D%0Aseparation between the husband and wife.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen one searches for a marriage partner, his purpose ought to be to choose%0D%0Aa life partner, to share with one another everything in life, happiness,%0D%0Agrief, etc. Compatibility as well as suitability between the husband and%0D%0Awife is of paramount importance. It is for that reason, Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised that the boy and girl see one another%0D%0Abefore marriage. If there is no compatibility between the spouses, for%0D%0Awhatever reason, it is irresponsible to proceed with the Nikah and%0D%0Asubsequently break it. That attitude may have a permanent and devastating%0D%0Aeffect on the girl. It also leads to having a bad impression about the girl.%0D%0ANot being 'very beautiful' is a weak basis for breaking a marriage. That%0D%0Ashould have been ascertained before marriage. Furthermore, what is the limit%0D%0Aof being very beautiful? It is irresponsible for a person to marry and%0D%0Athereafter simply divorce her because she is not very beautiful.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
