  "question": "Is it permissible to eat from a canteen that stopped selling Haraam food over 3 mths ago?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nOur canteen used to stock pork a few months ago, but have ceased to sell any 'Haraam' products. They now have a certified Halaal meat supplier, with all meals prepared on site. No specific cleaning of the utensils was carried out since they stopped providing pork products. The crockery/cutlery is washed in an industrial dishwasher daily. At least 3 mths have passed since the last time any Haraam meals were prepared there. The company is either not able to or not willing to pay the costs associated with Halaal certification.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShari'ah has emphasised on eating Tayyib foods. Tayyib refers to Halaal\nbeyond doubt.\n\nAlthough the washed utensils will be pure and the supplied meat is Halaal\nbut what measures are taken to ensure that there is no contamination of\nHaraam at all? We suggest that one should exercise precaution in purchasing\nmeat products from the Canteen until it is managed by a conscious Muslim.\n\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
