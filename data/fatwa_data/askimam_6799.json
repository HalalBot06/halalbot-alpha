  "answer": "QUESTION\nZaid broke 2 fasts in Ramadan 1996. These fasts were broken due to eating intentionally. He did not perform the kaffara for these fasts. The following year, he broke 1 fast due to indulging in sexual intercourse intentionally. How many kaffaras are now necessary for him to perform?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are different possibilities:\n\n1. A person broke his fast intentionally by eating, or drinking or intercourse on one day or many days in one Ramadhaan, then only one Kaffaarah is Waajib.\n\n2. If he broke his fast intentionally by eating or drinking in different Ramadhans, then too only one Kaffaarah is Waajib\n\n3. If he broke his fast intentionally by sexual intercourse in different Ramadhaan, then for each Ramadhan, a separate Kaffaarah has to be made.
