  "question": "Please can you tell me what the arabic word Lillah means? 2: Is it permissible to give Lillah to non-muslims in leu of gaining a reward?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Lillah literally means 'for the sake of Allah.'\n2. There is one of two possibilities: a) It is your own wealth, or b) You\nare distributing it on behalf of someone.\na) If it is your own wealth, you may spend it on needy non-Muslims with the\nintention of gaining reward from Allah Ta'ala. This too will be considered\nas Lillah. Fulfilling the needs of fellow humans is a highly meritorious\nact.\nb) If it is someone else's wealth, inquire from this person what his/her\nintention was. If it was his intention that it should be specifically for\nMuslims, then you may not spend it on non-Muslims. If it was his/her\nintention that it may also be spent on non-Muslims, you may then spend it on\nnon-Muslims.\n\nIf the actual donor's intention are unclear, the safest procedure would be\nto spend it only on Muslims.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
