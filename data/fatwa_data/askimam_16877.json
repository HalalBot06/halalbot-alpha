  "question": "I have a Skin disorder which makes it difficult for me to keep a beard",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI know that keeping a beard is wajib but what if you have a skin disorder which causes itchy and flaky red skin under the beard. This skin starts coming off and leaves patches of skin that are red that burn and the skin peels off. there is also patches of hair that fall out. In this case is it okay to trim the beard or shave it. Since  this at least stops the peeling off of skin.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nWe advice you to consult a reliable Muslim dermatologist (physicians specializing in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the skin and its appendages) and find out if any treatment could be carry out without you trimming or shaving the beard.  Kindly let us know the advice of dermatologist. We will advise thereafter.\n\nMay Allah grant you completely Shifaa and recuperation.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai \nDarul Iftaa"
