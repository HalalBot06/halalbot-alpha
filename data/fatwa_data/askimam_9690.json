  "question": "1. Is it correct that the prayer times for Hanafi & Shaafi madaahib differ ONLY for Aasar salaat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe other day, while surfing the internet, I did a little research of prayer times according to Hanafi and Shaafi madaahibs. The web-site at http://www.al-islam.com/ lists the following organizations as its source for the calculation method of prayer times: 1. Umm Al-Qura University 2. Muslim World League 3. Egyptian General Authority of Survey 4. University Of Islamic Sciences, Karachi 5. Islamic Society Of North America The ONLY difference was in the prayer time of Aasar salaat for the Hanafi and Shaafi madaahibs according to ALL of the above listed organizations. Please be kind enough to answer the following questions in detail: 1. Is it correct that the prayer times for Hanafi & Shaafi madaahib differ ONLY for Aasar salaat? 2. Can a follower of Hanafi madaahab call adhaan and/or lead Aasar salaat according to prayer schedule of Shaafi madaahab? Jaza-Allah-O-Khairan, Wa-As-Salaam-O-Alaykum Wa-Rahmaahtullahey-Wa-Baraakatah. Regards, Syed Abdul-Wajid\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe only real difference in Salaat times between the Hanafi Madhab and other Madhabs is in Asr Salaat. The differences in other Salaat times are not real, but on virtue (Afzaliyyat).\n\nThe view of the two famous students of Imaam Abu Hanifa (RA), Imaam Abu Yusuf (RA) and Imaam Muhammad (RA) concurs with the other Madhabs in Asr Salaat time. Hence, there is a leeway for a Hanafi in, for example, a Shaafi?ee dominated area, to perform Asr Salaat in the Shaafi?ee time.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
