  "question": "we need to mourn for 3 days over a funeral, Some practise 40 days of mourn/recitation.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nwhat we do during the 3 days [any special prayer or dua] How long IDDAT for the woman.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'None should mourn the death\nof a person but for three days.' (Bukhari)\n\nIt is clear from the abovementioned Hadith that it is not permissible to\nmourn the death of a person after three days. The only exception is the\nwidow. It is permissible for her to mourn the death of her husband until her\nIddat (waiting period after death) which is four months and ten days if she\nis not deceased. If she is deceased, her Iddat is till birth.\n\nThere is no specific prayer to be performed during the mourning period. One\nmay engage in any prayer without regarding that as compulsory. Allah Ta'ala\nstates, 'O you who believe! Seek assistance through patience and Salaat.\nVerily, Allah is with the patient ones'.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
