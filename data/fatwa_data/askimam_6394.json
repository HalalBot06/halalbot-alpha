  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have been really frustrated in my marriage, my husband isn't as religious as I would like him to be, and I would like for him to improve his ways as a husband and father. Two weeks ago, after an argument, I prayed Istikhara very sincerely before sleeping and all I remember is seeing my husband dead on my son's bed. I read in a Muslim book of dreams that this foretells divorce. I told my husband about my vision, and told him that maybe we should separate, he refused and said that he would change. He has changed a little, but a week later, I had a miscarriage so I prayed istikhara again during the daytime but not as sincere as the first time. We still have a few arguments and his wedding band broke, he said it was previously cracked a while ago. Sometimes I think he really is changing and sometimes I think I'm wasting my time,1) should I get a divorce? 2)What should I do? Jazak Allah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDivorce is not the only alternative whenever there is a bit of discord in\nthe marriage.\n\nIt seems that your husband is attempting to change. Help him along and\ncontinue encouraging him but in a very cheerful and diplomatic manner. Do\nnot nag him continuously or criticize him. Avoid looking for arguments or\ndisputes. Control your tongue. Don't think you are wasting your time. Think\npositively and be optimistic. His attempts to change - even though they\nfail - indicate his good intentions.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
