  "question": "is permissible in islam for a man to love a non-muslim (mirzae) woman",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI want to ask if it is permissible in islam for a man to love a non-muslim (mirzae) woman\n\nI loved a mirzae girl but i had an intention that i would marry her only if she accepts islam. In this case it is permissible to love a non-muslim girl\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe concept of love before marriage has no basis in Islam. It is, in fact, prohibited. Islam does not even permit a lustful glance on a woman and orders us to lower our gaze. A female is prohibited from talking in a sweet and melodious way to a male. All these acts have a potential of adultery and fornication.\n\nYour love to the Mirzaee girl or any girl for that matter is a major sin. You should terminate that relationship and make sincere Tawbah (repent) to Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
