  "question": "Is it allowed to use spells (ruqa) described in the book 'Tibbe Nabawi' to make an individual fall in love with you?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nLike in Tibbe Nabawi there are many methods by which you can do this - one is that you pray something into your kohl and apply it to your eyes - when the guy/girl sees you, he/she falls in love with you..there's another one wher you write some type of ta'weez thing then you let the paper burn, and love it supposed to be cast into the desired's heart - and you have to do it during specific times of the month becuse the stars supposely have an effect on the way things happen...Are these methods lawful if you don't want to approach an individual through haram means?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari?ah, it is prohibited to perform any Ruqyah (spell) to create any Islamically unlawful relationship between boys and girls.\n\nBy Tibb-e-Nabawiy, we presume you refer to the book of Allaamah ibn al-Qayyim [ra]. If so, kindly provide a detailed reference.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
