  "answer": "QUESTION\nwhat are the Sunnat length(s) of Imama? I heard Mulla Ali Qaari said 7 yards b) what are the sunnah colours of Imama? Mufti Rasheed Ahmed says that 'black imama' is not a sunnah? (refer Ahsanul Fatawa)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The length of the turban of sayyidina Rasulullah (sallallahu %C1layhi Wasallam) has not been given in the well known ahaadith .In a narration from Tabrani seven dhi-raa have been mentioned. Bayjuri has related from Ibn Hajar that this hadith has no origin. Allaamah Jazari says, I studied the books on seerah (the history of sayyidina Rasurullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), but I found no mention of any length. It is related from Imaam Nawawi that Sayyidina Rasulullah sallallahu %E1layhi wasallam had two turbans, one was a small one, the length of which was six dhi-raa (cubits) according to munaawi ,and seven dhi-raa according to Mulla Ali Qaari. The long one was twelve dhi-raa. The author of Madkhal mentions that the length of the turban of Sayyiduna Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was seven dhi-raa; he did not mention any other size. It was a continuous sunnah to wear the turban. It has been related that Sayyiduna Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) ordered the wearing of the turban. He said, ?Wear an amaamah (turban) regularly, for it increases one?s hilm (gentleness).? (Fathul Baari). Someone enquired from Abdullah ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu), ?Is it sunnah to wear an amaamah (turban)?? He replied, ?Yes, it is a Sunnah.? (Ainiy). (Shamaail Tirmidhi ? Shaykh Muhammad Zakariyyah)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. We are unable to locate Mufti Rashid?s saying that black amaamah is not a sunnah in Ahsanul Fataawa. However, there are many Ahaadith that prove that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) wore a black turban. It has been narrated that Amr ibn Hurayth (Radhiallaahu Anhu) said, ?I had seen Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) wear a black turban.? (Sahih Muslim). So, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)?s habit of wearing a black turban is well known. However, the Ulama have two meanings of a black turban. Some have translated it as a black coloured turban, whilst others say it is only a strip of cloth. Both are correct. (Shamaail Tirmidhi ? Shaykh Muhammad Zakariyyah)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
