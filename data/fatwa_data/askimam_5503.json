  "question": "If after urinating, small drops of urine keep leaking for 15 minutes, is my wuzu valid for salat? See details.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy problem is that whenever I finish urinating and do the taharat... little drops of urine still keep coming out slowly... this goes on for about 15 to 20 minutes. After that the ?leaking? stops. Now I was told by someone that for my prayers I have to perform wudu everytime before a prayer. I don?t have any problem doing that... but the problem is that this condition lasts for about 15 minutes only... if I do taharat after those 15 minutes, then im totally clean... What I want to know is that for example its maghrib time... and I feel the need to urinate... so is it alright if I urinate and then perform wudu and then salat... OR do I have to wait for those 20 mins after urinating before performing the wudu??? And what about my clothes?? How should I manage those... shall I change them everytime?.. I mean that way I would be going in and out of the bathroom all day!... Please clarify\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe basic rule is that you have to be completely at ease as far as these\ndrops are concerned.\n\nIn other words, you should be confident that no drops will come out and then\nonly should you make Wudhu. Therefore, in your case you will have to wait\n15 - 20 minutes and allow these droplets to be discharged and then perform\nWudhu. Why don't you go toilet after Salaat or allow extra time between\ntoilet and Salaat? As for your clothes, you can put a tissue or something\nsimilar to absorb these few droplets and then dispose of the tissue. In this\nmanner, you won't have a problem of changing repeatedly.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
