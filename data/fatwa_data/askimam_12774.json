  "question": "Which one of Lotto machine, credit card and bank loan is worse in Islam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to our understanding of your query, you enquire about gambling through a lotto machine and interest through a credit card or bank loan. If our understanding of your query is correct, then in essence your question relates to two evils and which one is worse.\n\nAs Muslims, our sense of submission and subjugation to Allah should direct us to the source of the prohibition. That is Allah. It suffices that Allah has expressly prohibited both, interest and gambling. He stated that the sins in both are more than the benefits. He also refers to both as Rijs (impure) and acts of Shaytaan. The evils of both extreme and detrimental to one?s Imaan. The question of relative evil is irrelevant when one focus on the source of the prohibition of both evils.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
