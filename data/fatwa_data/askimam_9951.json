  "question": "Hadith about Solomon. I need clarity. Please explain. Volume 8, Book 78, Number 634: 'Tonight I will sleep with ninety women,...'",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSelam Aleykum. I came across this hadith in the internet: Volume 8, Book 78, Number 634: Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, \"(The Prophet) Solomon once said, 'Tonight I will sleep with ninety women, each of whom will bring forth a (would-be) cavalier who will fight in Allah's Cause.\" On this, his companion said to him, \"Say: Allah willing!\" But he did not say Allah willing. Solomon then slept with all the women, but none of them became pregnant but one woman who later delivered a half-man. By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad's soul is, if he (Solomon) had said, 'Allah willing' (all his wives would have brought forth boys) and they would have fought in Allah's Cause as cavaliers. \" I always wondered wether this hadith is sahi, because I once read that the Prophets (s.a.w) are free from sin. Aren't they? I mean isn't it a sin to sleep with seventy women in one night, because we are allowed to marry only four women at a time? Or did I just misunderstood the hadith (I hope so)?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis Hadith is authentic. The restriction to four wives is for this Ummah, not for the previous ones neither for their prophets.\n\nMany of those who Sulaiman (alayhis salaam) slept with were slave girls as well, regarding whom there is no restriction.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
