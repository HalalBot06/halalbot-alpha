  "question": "bfore 10 years my father demised and I builded a small grave and kept name plate on my fathers grave. should i demolish the grave????",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am from India and my Father demised in india around 10 years back after his demise due to lack of knowledge and week tradition, we build a small grave (4 x 6), but we were not mature-aged at that time, after we grown up my younger brother remind me that our father use to tell us during his life that we should not build any grave after his demise as it is prohibited in islam. since around 2,3 months my younger brother is reminding me and telling that we will demolish the grave and make it a normal and plane land. I am really confused of this, please guide us under the bright light of our greate islam, I will remain thankful to you of your valuable time.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is unclear of what you mean by ?build a grave?. Nevertheless, if you mean that you built a concrete structure / wall or fencing around the grave, then this is incorrect.\n\nThe grave should be normal. It should have a slight slope made on top from the sand. If there is no objections, arguments or disputes among your family members or the cemetery caretakers, etc. you may break down the concrete structure. There is no problem having a simple name plate.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
