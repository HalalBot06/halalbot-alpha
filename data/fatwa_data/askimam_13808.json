  "answer": "QUESTION\nI work for my father, We have a few clothing stores in which we sell european fashion clothing.  We have always played music in the shop as i was taught by my father that music was essential to this sort of business as the customers are all young women who come into the store to buy their clothes.  But since learning that music is Haraam in Islam i have stopped playing the music in the shop and the shop assistants have complained to my father that i have stopped playing the music and its bad for business. \nMy father has today warned me to put the music back as he said there is nothing in Islam stopping us from playing music, beacuse we are not directly listening to the music as we are playing it for the customers.  And he has also said to me thatw e dont do everything according to Islam anyway so what difference does music make.\n\nI just want you to clarify from the Quran and Sunnah that music is Haraam..\n\nHe has also warned me if i dont listen to him he will relieve from my job within the business.  I try not to disobey my parents but he makes out that i never listen to them and i never do anything for them\n\nI am feeling really hurt and lonely.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n* Almighty Allah Taãla says in the Noble Qurãn: ‘And there are some people who purchase idle talk… for them is a severe punishment’. Ibn Masóod (Radhiyallaahu Ánhu) says that this verse was revealed regarding singing.\n\n* Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, ‘Allah ordered me to destroy musical instruments.’\n\n* Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, ‘People from my Ummat will drink wine and give it other names and singing girls and musical instruments will be played before them. Allah will cause the earth to swallow them, and disfigure their faces into apes and pigs.’\n\n* Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) mentioned, ‘When singing girls and musical instruments becomes common, wait for red winds, earthquakes, the earth swallowing people, disfiguring and many more punishments.’ (Mishkãt 470)\n\n* Hadhrat Ibn Mas’ood (Radhiallaahu Ánhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) declared every wine, gambling, beating of drums and every intoxicant as Haraam. (Abu Dawud)\n\nThe above references are clear that music is Haraam. Also note, Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘There is no obedience of a creation while disobeying Allah.’ It is not permissible for you to listen to your father and play music. Do not submit to the threats of your father. The punishment of Allah is more severe.\n\nHowever, never be disrespectful to your father. If your father relieves you from work, accept that. After, the one who provides for your father, will provide for you. Allah is the sole. Place your trust in Him.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
