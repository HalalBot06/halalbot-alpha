  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) My brother misbehaves in that he swears mildly, how do i help him kick the habit? He also hits me, his older sister (i'm 17, he's 12)how do i tell him off? He makes me mad and sometimes i hit him back because he provokes me alot. I dont tell my parents b/c i dont want them to get mad at us for fighting. 2) My nonmuslim grandfather is sick and i dont know how to pray for him. Everyone is certain that this is the end for him. I know it is not permissible to pray for nonmuslims when they die...but how do i handle the situation? 3) My brother also prays sitting when nothing is wrong. How do i discourage him?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. You state that your brother is 12 years old. This is the age to be groomed and nurtured with good manners. We observe that children of that age adopt habits very fast. If their character and conduct is not controlled and supervised, those adopted habits become their second nature and it then becomes very difficult to change them later. You are the brother and only 17. You do not have the desired authority to control and supervise your brother. You cannot hide his bad habits from your parents as that will lead to his condition becoming worse. You should inform your parents about your observations and concern for your brother?s character and conduct. Your father?s brief attention will have a positive impact on your brother.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. It is permissible for you to make Du?aa for the Shifaa and cure for your non-Muslim grandfather. Make Du?aa to Allah to grant him Imaan and make an effort to invite him to Islam. Do not despair of the mercy and assistance of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
