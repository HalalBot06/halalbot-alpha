  "answer": "QUESTION\nSince the rulers of our Muslim countries don?t rule by Sharee?ah and have left the fold of Islaam b/c of it, are the kuffar (non Muslims) who have traveled to the Muslims have a valid covenant with the Muslims? Since there covenant is with the kufr governments in Muslim lands and not with a Muslim leader or the people. Insh?allaah I hope u understand what I?m asking. Allaahoo Alim. Jazakullaah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe governments of the Muslim countries are legitimate. If they do not rule by Shari?ah law, they are sinful but that does not take them out of the fold of Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
