  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nis it advisable to have nikah and connsummate marriage later?\n\nI am muslim male who is to be engaged to my future partner in a week. we will not be consummating the mariage or living together for another year due to financial reasons and other reasons. i wish to get know my future partner by speaking on the phone with her , so that we can exchange ideas and develop a bond between us. since this is is not permissable without nikah, i wish to perform nikah in a few months time so that i may start communicating with her and later on consummate the marriage by starting to live together. is this advisable? generally in a situation where a partner is decided and there is a need to delay living together , is it better to get enagged and waiting an year for nikah? or have nikah as soon as possible and consummating marriage later\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf you exercise restraint in communicating with your future wife, then you could delay the Nikah. If you cannot exercise restraint, then it is advisable to perform the Nikah and save yourself from communicating with an unmarried woman which is a sin.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
