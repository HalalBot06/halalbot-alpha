  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe have a cloth shop, and we buy and sell clothes. After a season, we always have some over which we could not sell. The years go on, and we still can't sell some clothes but some of the clothes we can sell by lowering its price. Do we have to pay Zakat for the remaining clothes which we can not sell?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, there is Zakaat on stock-in-trade. The old stock will be included in the stock-in-trade and is also Zakaatable.\n\nIt is also important to point out that Zakaat could be given in kind as well. You could give the unsold clothes in Zakaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
