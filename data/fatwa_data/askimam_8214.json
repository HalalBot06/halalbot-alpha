  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it permissible 4 sum1 to work in a company which sells Halal & Haram products?e.g:We r INDEPENDENT distributors of a company called Goldquest Intl Ltd, which sells Numismatic Products(collectors items). The products include gold/platinum coins; gold/platinum watches; holiday packages; diamonds, etc. Some products r ?permissible? (non-image based); some products r ?obscure? (they include Islamic images like the Sacred Ka`bah with obscure images of ppl around); while other products r not permissible. These products/coins hav pictures & images, including images of Jesus Christ; Hindu \"gods\"(i.e. shirk based images), etc. I work in the Network Marketing side of the business, where THE INCOME IS BASED ON THE COMMISSION OF SALES (ON ANY/ALL OF THE ABOVE PRODUCTS) & my question-Is it permissible for me to work in this business while restricting it to only purchasing, or referring other people to the 'permissible' products such as holiday packages,etc?-which they would purchase directly from the company via the Internet-(some Muslim/s may purchase an image based product without our knowledge, or a non-Muslim/s may purchase these products ?down the line? as an indirect referral of ours/customer of the company). Would some sort of restriction to 1 product like this be needed anyway?Also, would this not be like one who is working in a Super Market (& other like companies which deals with Halal and Haram products), & at times paganistic/shirk type products such as X-Mas cards, etc?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible to work in the enquired business and restrict your referrals to permissible items only.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
