  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nplease tell me about the Hadees mentioned by people who insist that the fasting of 15th Shabaan particularly and ibaadat is of great reward as said by Huzoor(saw) narrated by Hazrat Ali(rta). following is the reference of that Hadees mentioned in one of the website.\n\"(sunan ibn-e-maja, jild 2, page# 160, raqm-al-hadees 1388, publish bairut)\"\n\nalso please tell me the authenticity of  \"6 nawafil\" performed in a specified manner in some masajid. is there any proof of those 6 nawafil.?\n\nwassalaam,\nfarooqi. \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nOne may fast on the 15th of Shabaan, however it is not necessary. The hadith in reference is supported by other Ahadith and could be considered for purpsoses of virtue based on the principles of hadith. If you are referring to the six rakaats of nawaafil that is performed specifically on this night then there is no basis for this in Shariah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
