However, without the intention of wuzu, one will not attain the reward for that wuzu. (Behishti Zewar p51)\n\n2)      Allah Ta'ala says in the Qur'an Kareem\n\n\"And provide them shelter where you stay and do not harm them\".\n\n (S. 65 V. 6)\n\n \n\nWhen a man divorces his wife, he must provide her shelter during her Iddat. Even when the marriage has deteriorated, the husband has to provide her shelter. How much more important it would be upon him to fulfill the obligation during the normal marriage period. The verse clearly indicates that the husband must provide shelter for the wife. Despite this verse exhorting the husband to provide shelter for his wife, the purpose for her shelter is to protect her belongings and her privacy. If she is staying with other people in the house (e.g. her in-laws) then her room will be her private space. It will not be permissible for any person of the house to enter her room without her consent. (Shami Vol. 2).\n\n \n\nWe understand your condition and make dua that Almighty Allah makes this matter easy for you. As explained above, you have the right to your privacy and none can invade your personal space; neither your brother in-law, nor your in-laws. You have complete control over your privacy to such an extent that your husband cannot force you to grant access to anyone without your approval.\n\n \n\nHowever, this is a very delicate issue which can create family feuds. Therefore, you should take care when presenting your concerns to your husband. Knowing that you are not on good terms with your in-laws, your husband may sense aversion from you to his parents and brother and this may cause him to have an aversion towards you. So act with wisdom in order to keep the peace with your in-laws and to keep the respect of your husband.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
