  "question": "Is blind following of a scholar allowed?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Respected Mufti Saab, as I am not a scholar so must I follow my scholar in everything or only in things which do not contradict BIG issues which is commonly known in Islam. Do I get sin if I follow the ruling of a local Mufti and he is wrong in the issue. JazakAllah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala states in the Qur'aan, 'Hence, ask those with (knowledge) of%0D%0Athe Divine Book if you know not.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above Aayat is clear that one should refer to the Ulama (learned%0D%0Ascholars) in matters of Deen (religion). When a person requires advise on a%0D%0Aworldly matter, he refers to an expert on that matter. Similarly, in%0D%0Areligious matters, one should refer to an expert in religion.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhenever a person is faced with medical problem, he continues to consult%0D%0Awith a reliable practitioner in his locality as long as he is satisfied with%0D%0Ahis services. Sometimes the need arises to consult with another expert in%0D%0Aorder to gain satisfaction. Similarly, we should refer our Deeni (religious)%0D%0Aproblems to such an Aalim (scholar) with whose piety and Faqaahat%0D%0A(jurisprudence) we are satisfied. However, if the need arises to consult%0D%0Awith another Aalim to gain satisfaction, that is not inconsistent with the%0D%0Adictates of the aforementioned Aayat.%0D%0A%0D%0AOne should be cautious that in pursuit of gaining satisfaction, he%2Fshe does%0D%0Anot become disrespectful to the learned scholars of Deen. In the medical%0D%0Afield, practitioners adopt different methods in treating the same disease,%0D%0Ayet the opinion of each one is respected.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn worldly affairs, derogating the opinion of any expert may not cause any%0D%0Aserious repercussions beyond the earthly existence but to lose respect of%0D%0Athe learned scholars of Deen is extremely hazardous to one's faith. It is%0D%0Astated in one Hadith, 'Whomsoever shows no mercy to our youngsters, does not%0D%0Arespect the elders among us, and exalts not our Ulama (learned scholars) is%0D%0Anot of us.'%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore, a person should follow such an Aalim with whom he is satisfied%0D%0Aand is certain of his reliability, who is sanctioned by the Ulama of his%0D%0Atime in all Deeni (religious) matters as long as he is consistent upon the%0D%0ASunnah (way of Nabiy (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). If any doubt arises in%0D%0Ahis piety or motives, then without losing respect of the first, another%0D%0AAalim may be consulted.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
