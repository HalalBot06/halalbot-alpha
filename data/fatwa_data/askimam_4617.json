  "question": "Ghusl/wudhu with a cast?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaam I have fractured my leg and it is in a plaster cast from the toes till above the knee, the plaster cast cannot be wet! 1 - How can I go about making ghusl since i cannot wet the area covered by the cast(toes to upper thigh)? 2 - Also, due to this fracture & cast I cannot reach my feet..& one foot is covered by the cast. What should I do when making wudhu(washing feet)? Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt will suffice for you to make Masah (pass wet hands) over the entire\nplaster during Ghusl and the feet area during Wudhu.\n\nBy doing so, you will be pure and your Wudhu will be valid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
