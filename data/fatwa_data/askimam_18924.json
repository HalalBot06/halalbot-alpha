  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMe and my wife own quiet a lot of gold (about 25 tola) that we got at our marriage from our parents and as gifts. I am a government servant and am hrdly managing my expenses in my salary. My wife is a housewife and we do not have any other source of income. At the end of the year, I dont have any surplus money to pay zakat. Should I sell a part of that gold every year to pay it or take some loan etc. \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIf you are unable to discharge your zakah through money, then it is compulsory for you to sell 2.5 percent of your gold and pay zakah.\n\nIf you and your wife jointly own the jewelry, then both of you will have to discharge the zakah according to your respective portion.\n\n(Aap kay Masail, Vol.3, Pg. 385, Maktabah Bayyinat)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl.
