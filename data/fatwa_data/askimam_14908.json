  "question": "Is it right to hold the Jumaa in such rooms in the given circumstances?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMany Muslim students studying in universities in foreign lands are facing the problem of praying Namaz-e-Jumaa. The mosques are usually at long distances from the universities and, friday being a full working day, it is not possible for many students to attend the Jumaa. So the usual practice is to ask the university administration to designate a room as prayer room and pray jumaa in it. It is notable that no other prayer is held in congregation in the prayer room. Is it right to hold the Jumaa in such rooms in the given circumstances?\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nIf the Muslim students can not travel to the Masjid for Jummah Salah due to the circumstances that were mentioned and they wish to establish Jummah Salah in one of the designated rooms on campus, then the Jummah will be valid.\n\n \nRad Al-Muhtar (2/151)\nBada’i  Al-Sana’i (1/602)\nAl-Bahr Al-Ra’iq (2/151)\nFatawa Mahmoodia (14/251)\nAhsan Al-Fatawa (4/130)\nFatawa Uthmania (1/571)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
