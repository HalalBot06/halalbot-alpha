  "question": "Can we walk infront of people if the mosque is jammed?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaams, I perform juma at certain mosue which becomes very,very full at this time.Sometimes there is no place for Sajda.We go early to get a decent spot but after namaaz to get out is a problem.The mosque is still jammed pack and we sometimes have to walk infront of people to get out ,Is this permissible? The mosque is a standard mosque size like +- 500 sqm! Please advise!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the Musjid, room or courtyard is smaller than 334,45 square meters, then in that case, it will not be permissible to cross in front of a Musallee, whether from near or far. If the Musjid, etc. 334.45 square meters or more as in your case, then it will be permissible to cross in front on condition that the distance between you and the Musallee is approximately 3 Saffs, i.e. from where he is standing. The distance is measured by some Ulama is 2,44 meters (Ahsanul Fataawa).%0D%0A%0D%0AIf there is a need to cross and the abovementioned space, i.e. 2,44 meters is not possible, then one of the following may be practised upon:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Place an object which is approximately 1 arm?s length high in front of the Musallee.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. If this is not available, then something which is less than one arm?s length.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Placing a stick or drawing a line should be done lengthwise, i.e. towards the Qiblah, although breath is also permissible.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. It is permissible to cross after the place of Sajda of the Musallee, i.e. one Saff from the standing position of the Musallee.%0D%0A%0D%0AExcept for no.4 above, the other 4 options are in the time of need.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
