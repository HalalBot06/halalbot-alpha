  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease give me a clear answer on why is it forbidden for men to wear shorts that are above knees & also why is it forbiden for men to wear gold ornaments?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\n \n\n1) According to the Fuqahaa, the Awrah of a man is from below the navel up to and including the knee. It is necessary to cover this portion of the body at all times. It is not permissible for a male to expose any part of his Awrah to another person or to look at the Awrah of another.\n\n( وعورة الرجل ما تحت السرة إلى الركبة ) لقوله عليه الصلاة والسلام { عورة الرجل ما بين سرته إلى ركبته }\n(الهداية ج1 ص92,شركة)\n(البحر الرائق ج8 ص192,رشيدية) \n\nBy wearing shorts that do not cover the knees, the Awrah will be exposed which is not permissible in Shariah.   \n\n2) The following Hadeeth is narrated in Sunan Abi Dawood:\n\nعن عبد الله بن زرير يعني الغافقي أنه سمع علي بن أبي طالب رضي الله عنه يقول إن نبي الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أخذ حريرا فجعله في يمينه وأخذ ذهبا فجعله في شماله ثم قال إن هذين حرام على ذكور أمتي  (سنن أبى داود, ج2 ص205, سعيد)  \n\n“Once the Prophet of Allah ((صلى الله عليه وسلم took a piece of silk in his right hand and some gold in his left hand, then he said: “verily these two (i.e. silk and gold) are forbidden upon the males of my ummah. \n\n \n\n ( ولا يجوز للرجال التحلي بالذهب ) لما روينا ( ولا بالفضة ) لأنها في معناه ( إلا بالخاتم والمنطقة وحلية السيف من الفضة )\n(الهداية ج4 ص457,شركة)\n(البحر الرائق ج8 ص190,رشيدية) \n\nHence, it is not permissible for men to adorn themselves with ornaments made of gold.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa\n\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER - Askimam.org questions\n\nThe Askimam.org Site answers issues pertaining to Shariah.
