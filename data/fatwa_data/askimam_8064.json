  "question": "I was labelled a Faasiq because I donot wear \"Sunnat\" beard or dress according to the \"Sunnat\" (wearing of a Qurta). Please comment.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAccording to the accusor any testimony of mine will not be accepted, and i cannot defend any accusations made against me, because i am a Faasiq. I was also told that I if I wear Qurta for 40 days and grow a sunnat beard, and that will make me a better muslim.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nCutting or shaving of the beard lesser than a fist length is Fisq (sin). In fact, it is a greater sin than many other sins because this evil is openly displayed and an open transgression of Shari?ah. The Shahaadat (witnessing) of a Faasiq (sinner) is not accepted.\n\nHowever, if there are no just witnesses in a particular case and there is fear of somebody?s right being neglected and this Faasiq is most probably speaking the truth, then the Fuqahaa have ruled that his testimony could be accepted. (Ahsanul Fatawa vol.7 pg.204). Nevertheless, to trim the beard lesser than fist length is a sin and one should immediately abstain from such actions. One should make sincere Tawbah of which the condition is that you make a firm determination never to return to the sin again, in your instance, never to trim your beard again lesser than a fist length.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
