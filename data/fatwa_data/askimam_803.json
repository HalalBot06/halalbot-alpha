  "question": "My father does not say prayers except of the Jumma Prayer. He is also Hafi-e-Quran. What should I do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have repeatedly said to my father to say prayers atleast one time a day. But all in vain. Kindly throw some light on it and also pray for my father and also for me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two aspects here:\nOne is I'elaam (to inform) and the other is I'emaal (to make others practice). Informing is merely a means of making others practice. The purpose (to make others practice) should be placed first and then wisdom should be applied in trying to achieve the purpose.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
