  "question": "Can a boy trim his bushy eyebrows using Laser Hair removal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam. I am a 19 year old boy. I have very thick eyebrows which also join together. Can I trim them using Laser Hair Removal as it does not involve plucking of eyebrows? Also this procedure is permanent; I'll have to go for 4 or 5 sittings only, after which my problem will be solved. What are the circumstances under which a boy/girl can trim his/her eyebrows using Laser Hair removal?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf you eyebrows have become so thick that they are about double the thickness of those of a normal person, thus they have become a fault, then there is permissibility for bringing them back to their normal size.\n\nNote: Your eyebrows CANNOT be thinned so much that they become thinner than what is normal.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Husain Kadodia\nSTUDENT: Darul Ifta\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
