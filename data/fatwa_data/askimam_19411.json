Sahaaba & other family members who passed on before and do they give the full report of the people in the world\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nIt is mentioned in a hadith,\n'When Ramadhan comes, the gates of paradise are opened, the gates of hellfire are locked and the devils are shackled.' (Bukhari)\n\nWe can deduce from this Hadith that the one who passes away in Ramadhan, will be safeguarded from punishment by the grace of almighty Allah. \n(fatawa mahmudiyyah 1/630) (ahsanul fatawa 4/208)\n\nImam Ahmed narrates in his compilation of Hadith that the messenger of Allah (sallahu alaihi wasallam) said,\n'whoever professes La ilaha illah (there is no god besides Allah) seeking the pleasure of Allah and happens to pass away in that state, he will enter paradise. Whoever fasts a day seeking the pleasure of Allah and happens to pass away in that state, he will enter paradise.'\n\nA person who passes away in the state of fasting will enter paradise.  (fatawa mahmudiyyah 1/631)\n\nWith regards to meeting one's predecessors after death,if one is amongst the fortunate ones and successfully answers the questioning in the grave, he will get to meet whom he wants.\n(fatawa mahmudiyyah 1/612)\n\nA Hadith states that when a person passes away, he meets the souls of the believers and discusses the affairs of the living.\n(Nasai Hadith no.1834)\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Faraz Ibn Adam,\nUK\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
