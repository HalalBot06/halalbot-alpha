  "question": "Is it true that couples are made in heaven?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMufti Sahib, Salaam. I have a question for you: Is it true Allah has made a life partner for every one at the time they were born? Meaning if someone is meant as a life partner for somebody they are going to get him or her? How can one tell if some one is meant for them? Please provide any Hadith or Quranic Ayat regarding this matter also any special duass to make difficult situations easy and to get over depression.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe common saying that couples are made in Jannah actually refers to the\nabsolute knowledge of Allah. He knows everything ahead of time. That\nincludes a person's marriage partner. However, this world is Darul Asbaab\n(word of means). One has to adopt means for everything and the outcome of\nones efforts will be according to the decree and perfect knowledge of Allah.\nIf a person is of a marriageable age, his/her seniors should inform people\nand request their assistance in getting a compatible marriage partner. If\nanyone shows interest and proposes, then one should decide by making\nIstikhaara and Mashura. If the procedures are appropriately carried out, the\noutcome will be a success. Whatever, the outcome is, that was known to Allah\nahead of time.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
