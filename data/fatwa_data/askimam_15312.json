However, if one did not become physically mature by the age of fifteen, he will be classified as Baaligh (mature) there from.\nOne must make Qada for the five Fardh Salaah as well as the Witr Wajib Salaah. \nThere is no Qada for Eid Salaah. The Qada for Jumma Salaah will be Zuhr Salaah.\nIf a person laughs aloud during Salaah, the Wudhu and Salaah will break.\nIt is not necessary to make Qada for the Salaah missed before becoming baaligh (mature). The calculation must start from the time you attained maturity.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
