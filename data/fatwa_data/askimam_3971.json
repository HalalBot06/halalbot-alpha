  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKhudaij (Arabic - dimunitive of Khadeej) meaning small, young, small bodied,\nof small statue, etc. (Dimunitives in Arabic are used to express\nendearment).\n\nRoomaanah (Arabic) - a derivative of Raama - to seek or intend. Generally, a\nsuffix of Alif noon denotes the superlative. Thus, Rooman (fem. Roomaanah)\ncould mean determined, seeking, etc. A close match is Rummaanah meaning\neither pomegranate or navel (anactomy) - which is the centre of the body,\nthus, it could mean a central or focal figure, etc.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
