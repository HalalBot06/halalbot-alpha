  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n (1)  Is vitiligo disease a punishment in islam? is there a story in alquran about the disease? where is it in quran, which ayah/surah? is there a story in hadits      regarding the disease? thank you for helping me\n\n(2) i make an oath in the past, and i have broke it, what should i do? i want to cancel the oath because i dont know if i can keep it, because i make the oath back when i was 13, and already had my first dream (Aqil balig)\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1.)    Vitiligo disease is not mentioned as a punishment in Islam nor is it mentioned in the Quran. \n\nWhen Allah (Subhana WaTa’ala) has inflicted a person with a disease he has done so for the reason of testing one and for the reason of punishing one. As in the case of Ayub (A’lahi Salaam) Allah (Subhana WaTa’ala) tested him with the disease of leprosy in which he succeeded. He did not inflict him with this disease for the purpose of punishment. Contrary to that was the infliction of the disease onto Samree, whom was being punished in his situation for his disobedience.\n\n2.)    As for the oath, we need to know how it was taken to enable us to give a ruling on it.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
