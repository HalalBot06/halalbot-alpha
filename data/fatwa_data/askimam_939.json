  "answer": "QUESTION\nSallam alaikum, I met a Muslim man who is married to a Christian woman.We felt in love, we love eachother deeply, and we both love Islam more than anything.He cant practice Islam the way he would like to,cause of the fact that he is married to the Christian woman.I converted to Islam after meeting him,but not because of him.I would like to know,what Islam says about this situation. Should I let him be, or should I try with some means to convince him that he should practice his religion which is more important than his marriage to a Christian woman. Can he divorce her? They have a child together.I need some advice, pleace help me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSince the man is married and have a child, your intrusion may affect their marriage.\n\nThe brother should be advised to make an effort in converting his wife to Islam. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised that a woman should not ask a man to divorce his wife so that she becomes the sole wife. (Bukhari vol.2) If he is interested in marrying you, he should apply wisdom\nand discuss the matter with his wife to avoid acrimony in the matter.\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
