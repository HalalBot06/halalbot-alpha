  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nI want to become an alim and do studies plus get married.\n\nIs there some du’a I may be able to recite so I can get high grades and a du’a to get a pious wife soon?\n\nIs smoking Haraam?\n\nWas salatul janaza read on RasullAllah (s.a.w)? Every one\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is a universally accepted fact that smoking is injurious to the smoker and to his surroundings. Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم)  said, “There is no causing harm to oneself and to other in Islam.” It is clear from the aforegoing that smoking is prohibited.\nSalatul Janaza was performed on Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم). There was no one Imam for the salatul Janaza of Rasullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم). Sahaba came in groups and each sahabi performed salatul Janaza by himself.\n\nWe take note of your zeal to study and get married. May Allah make you successful in all your endeavors, Ameen.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
