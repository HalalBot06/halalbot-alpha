  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen you have a wet dream and the semen gets on your clothes and u put that piece of cloth in the washing machine for a wash and after the wash has finished, some semen traces are still on the cloth. Do i the wash the whole load again or just that cloth?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis depends on how the clothes were washed and what type of machine was\nused.\n\nIn principle, if after the clothes have been washed, there still remains\ntraces of semen in such a way that it could very easily be removed by\nanother wash then it must be washed since this proves that the first wash\nwas not effectice. This will apply to all the clothes in the load. Once you\nare satisfied and convinced that the clothes are clean and pure, then this\nis sufficient.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
