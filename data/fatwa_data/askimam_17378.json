  "question": "I purchased an article. I paid the person via internet transfer.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI purchased an article.\n\nI paid the person via internet transfer.\n\nA few days later the money was reflected in my acount again.\n\nI checked with the supplier the money reflected in his bank statement. when he checked his account.\n\nThe supplier was happy and sent me receipt for payment and accepted my payment for the article.\n\nI checked with my bank - they say the account number was incorrect and hence the payment was rejected.\n\nWhat should I do - return the article to the supplier?\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYou should resubmit the payment to the supplier and inform him to notify his bank that he was credited twice. This would be the morally correct thing to do. It is extremely important that as Muslims, we abide by the strictest ethical code and portray a good example for the non-Muslims. It is not appropriate for Muslims to involve themselves in any actions that will be a cause of ignominy or disrepute. Unfortunately, the biggest complaint against Muslims today, and duly so, is that they do not practice what they preach. Thus, you should fulfill the payment and anticipate your reward for acting in accordance to the teachings of Islam from Allah. May Allah guide the entire Muslim Ummah to act in accordance to our pristine morals and teachings. Amin.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nMl. Yusuf bin Yaqub,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\nDarul Iftaa"
