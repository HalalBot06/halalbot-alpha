  "question": "Is it permissible for me to marry a christian women even though she does not want to convert to islam.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n'And We have made permissible the pure women from the believers and the pure women from the people of the Book.' (Maaidah)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above verse is clear that it is permissible for a Muslim male to marry a female from the Ahl-ul-Kitaab (Jews%2FChristians).%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Christians during the time of the revelation had the distorted beliefs of trinity, crucifixion, etc. Despite that, Allah Ta?ala permits marrying a Christian or Jewish female. However, the purpose of marrying such females is their apparent adherence to a heavenly revealed book which could be a stepping stone into understanding the true religion (Islam). Understandably a marriage has influence on a person's thinking and ideology. Since the male is stronger generally, he would be able to influence his wife into Islam. Therefore, it is not permissible for a Muslim female to marry a Christian or Jewish male purchance she will be influenced to leave Islam.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt must be noted that if the Muslim male is weak in his Islam, and there is fear of him being influenced by the Christian%2FJewish wife, it is not permissible for him to marry her. A Christian%2FJewish woman should not be just by registration while not really being a Christian%2FJew.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
