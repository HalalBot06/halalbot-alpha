  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWill marriage to anyone else work after I have had a positive outcome from my first Istekharrah?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf you are doubtful whether your marriage to another person will be successful or not, you should make Istikhaara again.\n\nThe positive outcome from your first Istikhaara does not necessarily mean that your present intention to marry another person will not be successful.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
