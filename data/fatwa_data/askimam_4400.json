  "question": "Zakaat on investment property",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI own a property which I have rented out for 11 months. Prior to renting the property I lived in the property. 1. Do I have to pay zakaat on the property? 2. If yes, is it pay on market value of rental income? 3. If rental income can I deduct direct expenses from the rental income eg. Bond repayments, rates etc?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nZakaat is not payable on the actual property. Zakaat is only levied on the\nincome received. Your Zakaat on the income received will be calculated as\nfollows:\nCash on hand less current liabilities (like annual bond repayments, rates,\netc.) Zakaat is payable on the balance. You may not deduct expenses which\nyou think may fall due during the course of the year - like maintenance,\netc.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
