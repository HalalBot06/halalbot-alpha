  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour zeal to learn the procedure to fulfil the Sunnah of Nikah is encouraging. May Allah Ta?ala increase your zeal to educate yourself in Shari?ah, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen a person intends undertaking an important task, he should do the following:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Make Du?aa to Allah Ta?ala for guidance.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Perform Salaat of need (Haajat)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Offer some charity according to one?s means.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Consult with one?s seniors and pious people%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Consult with the Ulama and enquire if the advise given is according to the Shari?ah if you are doubtful.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. If you have identified (see) a girl for marriage, then you should discuss that with your seniors%0D%0A%0D%0A7. Enquire about the girl, her character and conduct, etc. Her Deeni inclination is of utmost importance%0D%0A%0D%0A8. Also enquire about the family. The temperament and nature of the family (parents in particular) plays a crucial role in one?s marriage life%0D%0A%0D%0A9. Once you are satisfied and do not have any reservations, then the seniors of the family should identify an appropriate person to send a proposal%0D%0A%0D%0A10. If you have reservations, then make Istikhaara and follow the rules of Istikhaara%0D%0A%0D%0A11. Once the proposal is sent, turn your gaze on Allah and make du?aa that Allah must grant an outcome which is best for your acceptance or refusal%0D%0A%0D%0A12. Whatever is the response, be happy and content with that%0D%0A%0D%0A13. Do not propose for a girl who is inclined towards another proposal%0D%0A%0D%0A14. If you receive a positive response, try to perform the Nikah as soon as possible and with the least amount of expenses incurred%0D%0A%0D%0A15. Lead your marriage life according to the Sunnah%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
