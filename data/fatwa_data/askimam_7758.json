  "answer": "QUESTION\nMufti, I have chosen to read Isthikara namaaz as I need to make a decision with regards to my career. I am currently not happy with my job and it is family that I work for. The dream placed me in a very dark room but everything around me had a bright orange glow. I saw my cousin (boss) speak(angrily) to me but could hear his wife's voice. The room was also filled with smoke and everytime i tried to speak to him, nothing came out. Please interpret this dream for me as I need to make a decision whether I want to work there or not. Jazakullah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is a negative indication in the dream.\n\nAfter making Istikhaara, if you feel uneasiness in your heart in continuing your employment, you may regard that as a guidance through Istikhaara.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
