  "question": "1.From whom my wife should do purdah 2.I have seen a very bad dream about me and my wife. What should I do (sadqa etc)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nFrom whom my wife should do purdah 1) My brother 2) My brother in law. 3) My 1st cousins. 4) My 2nd cousins. 5) Her brother in laws. 6) Her 1st cousin 7) Her 2nd cousin.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Many bad dreams are from Shaytaan who wishes to instill fear in a person\nand distract his/her attention in Ibaadat. You should recite, 'Laa hawla\nwalaa quwwata illaa billaah' and ignore the dream. Giving charity is indeed\nan efficient way of averting evil from one's path.\n2. All the relatives in reference are Ghayr Mahrams (not prohibited in\nmarriage). In principle, a female must maintain Hijaab from any Ghayr\nMahram.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
