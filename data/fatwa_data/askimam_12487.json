  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow and when did reciting the shahada become the way to convert to Islam and did it always include the second half (Prophet Muhamed (SAW) being the messenger of Allah)? Did the Prophet (SAW) recite this to become a Muslim? Did the Prophet (SAW) recite the kalima when he prayed namaaz the same way we do? If not, isn?t this considered bidat?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The recitation of the actual Shahaadah is not a requirement for conversion to Islam. Even if a person merely expresses his faith in Allah and His Rasul [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam], he is declared a Muslim. Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] asked a slave woman once, ?Where is Allah?? She replied, ?Up there.? He then asked, ?Who am I?? She replied, ?The Prophet of Allah.? Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] declared her a Muslim. This clearly shows that the recitation of the actual Shahaadah is not a requirement for conversion but it is merely preferable.\n\n2. You question about reciting Kalimah in Salaat is unclear, kindly clarify.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
