Allah Ta’ala tests a person in many ways. In that condition, a person will experience tension and pain. It is not appropriate to blindly attribute all pain to black magic. During difficulties and pain, one should resort to Salaat and Du’aa. Favourable conditions as well as adverse conditions are from Allah. He is the only one to remove pain and hardship. Turn to Him, He will guide to means of ease and comfort.\n\nAbstain from sin. Fulfil the daily obligations of Shari’ah. Also try to remain in the state of Wudhu. After all the above, recite Aayaatul Kursi after each Fardh Salaat and the four Quls at night before sleeping.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
