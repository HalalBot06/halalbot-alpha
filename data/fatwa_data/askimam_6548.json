  "question": "What is the correct way of naming a child? If the father is called Masud Ahmed and he calls his son Khalid. Can he give the full name Khalid Masud",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs there a proper way of naming a boy and girl. Many people use middle names in western countries therefore many Muslims living in these countries give middle names to their children ie many girls have a middle name of Fatimah. Is it ok to give a middle name and is it necessary to have a surname. If the father is called Masud Ahmed and he calls his son Khalid. Can he give the full name Khalid Masud to his son? Can he call him Khalid Bin Masud or should it be Khalid Ibn Masud? A detailed answer would be appreciated.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe companions of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) are guiding starts. We%0D%0Ashould endervour to follow them in every aspect of life. Similarly, it is%0D%0Aimportant to keep a good name for our child. What better can there be than%0D%0Athe names of Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhu)?%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore, firstly, we should name our children after the Sahaaba. Secondly,%0D%0Aas long as the child can easily be distinguished from others of a similar%0D%0Aname, it is sufficient. Many Sahaaba, for example, named their sons%0D%0AAbdullah. Therefore, in order to distinguish one from another, the father's%0D%0Aname was attached to the son, e.g. Abdullah ibn Umar, Abdullah ibn Mas'ood,%0D%0AAbdullah ibn Abbaas, Abdullah ibn Ja'afar, etc. (Radhiallaahu Anhum). In our%0D%0Acustom, the surname will suffice to distinguish two such person who have the%0D%0Asame name. There is no compulsion that one has to attach the father's name%0D%0Awith the name of the son like Sahaaha did. The object is to distinguish%0D%0Awhich can be attained through the surname, however, if one wants to do away%0D%0Awith a surname and attach his name with his son's name, then there is no%0D%0Aharm.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
