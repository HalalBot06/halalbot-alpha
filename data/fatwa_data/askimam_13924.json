If the Muslim forum is set up in such a way that it rules out all risk and possibility of strange males and females communicating directly which may be used as a stepping stone to further vice and sin. It will be permissible to post on such a forum. However, we strongly advocate the setting up of female only Muslim forums.\n\n2. As a prerequisite for Salaat, a woman should ensure that her entire body is covered except for her face, feet and hands (upto the wrists). This includes the entire neck including the upper portion thereof. (Raddul Muhtaar vol.1 pg.406; HM Saeed)\n\n3. As a necessity, a woman is allowed to answer the phone. However, after establishing that the person on the other side is a male stranger, a woman should ensure not to speak in soft and alluring tones. (Surah33 Aayat32). Furthermore, the communication should be limited to the need.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
