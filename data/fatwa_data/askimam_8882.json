  "question": "What is the best way to calculate salat time in the united states is it to use computerized salat time from internet or judge by the rise and decline of the sun if possible?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI read in Bahishti Zewar under the chapter of salat qada; salat masallah 11 about having to offer witr before fajr and if one does not then the fajr is incomplete I don?t understand this because witr is wajib and fajr fardz why would witr have to be made before fajr could be made? What is the punishment in shariah for taking riba? Also was the stance of imam abu hanifa rahmatullah alahie regards to cutting off the hands of thieves for stealing, I have heard that it was only the other three imams shafi, ahmad, and malik rahmatullah alahie who said this to be the punishment, did abu hanifa hold a different stance at all, what is the evidence of Quran and Hadith relating to this subject? What is the best way to calculate salat time in the united states is it to use computerized salat time from internet or judge by the rise and decline of the sun if possible? What is the qiblah dirrection in michigan, united states? Does night begin after maghrib or isha salat, what is the best way to calculate the beginning of the last third of the night and also how to judge that fajr time has come in? And is it makrooh or haraam to pray when the sun is coming up? When is the proper ishraq time? Also how should the time of salatuldoha be calculated?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. This refers to a specific type of person only, i.e. that person who does not have to offer any other Qadhaa Salaat. This type of person is known as a ?Saahib-e-Tartib?, i.e. a person of sequence. It is incumbent upon him to follow that specific sequence when discharging his Salaat. Hence, Witr will have to be discharged first and then the Fajr, in order to keep to the correct sequence. For more details, refer to the entire section of Qadhaa Salaat in Bahishti Zewar.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The Qur?aan and Ahaadith are replete with such warnings. It is not possible for us to encompass all, hence, we will suffice on one from the Qur?aan and one from Hadith. Allah Ta?ala says, ?O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from Ribaa (usury) if you are verily believers. And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and his messenger?? (Baqarah v278). Hadhrat Jaabir (Radhiallaahu Anhu) said that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) cursed the one who takes Riba, one who gives Ribaa, one who writes the transaction and those that witness it.? (Mishkaat pg.244; Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Cutting off the hands as a punishment for theft is proven through the Aayat of the Qur?aan, ?As for a male and female thief, then cut off their hands.? (Maaidah Aayat37 para6). This type of punishment is also proven through numerous Ahaadith and has also reached the category of Ijmaa (consensus) as well. (Fiqh alal madhaahibil arba vol.5 pg.153). Hence, there is no difference of opinion regarding cutting off hands being a punishment for a thief. However, the different Imaams do hold different views regarding who should be categorised as thief and all the other details related to it.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. If these computers correctly indicate towards the Qiblah and are proven to be authentic and reliable, then one may use them also. In this time and age, it will be recommended to use modern technology as an aid. However, the original way is to determine it directly by oneself. The actual direction of Qiblah in Michigan should be determined by consulting the local reliable Ulama.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Time of Ishraaq begins after sunrise when the sun rises until an arms length. The exact time differs from place to place and season. Time of Ishraaq continues until %BC day.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe time for Salaat al-Dhuhaa (Chaast) starts immediately after Ishraaq. However, the most meritorious time is after %BC of the day has passed.%0D%0A%0D%0ATahajjud Salaat starts after Esha Salaat uptil Subh-e-Saadiq (starting time of Fajr). Whoever desires to pass 1%2F3 of night in Tahajjud should divide the night into 3 parts and read Salat in the middle third and sleep in the first and last third. If he wishes to pass %BD the night in Ibaadat, then the second half is more meritorious. (Ahsanul Fatawa vol.3 pg.467). Night is calculated from sunset (Maghrib) till Subh-e-Saadiq (Fajr)%0D%0A%0D%0A6. Salaat performed when the sun is coming up is invalid. (Ahsanul Fataawa vol.2 pg.130). it is Makrooh-e-Tahrimi to read Salaat at such a time. (Shaami vol.1 pg.371)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
