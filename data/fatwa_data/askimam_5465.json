  "question": "My wife is not religious...should i make dis clear to her that if she does not try to change herself then i will leave her?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam Alykum! Please help me to make my decision I would like to ask what can i do according to the Quran and Hadith? I live in europe and would like to spend rest of my life according to the Quran and Sunnah of our Prophet Peace be Upon Him. My wife is not religious. she does not pray namaz, does not wear the scarf and makes sure she wear nice clothes when she goes out and her hair style is good. I have tried to teach her but no luck. Sometime i just think to end the marriage and Allah will help me to find a better wife. But then i start thinking again as this is my 2nd marriage and have 3 kids as well. I am 30 year old. Should i make this very clear to her that if she does not try to change herself then i will leave her? and do so if she does not try? I am really confused and don?t know what to do? Jazak Allah Khairen\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Qur'aan has shown us the procedure when dealing with our wives, a)\nAdvice, b) If this fails, then separation from their beds and if this fails,\nc) a light form of chastisement.\n\nAs far as possible, do not end the marriage. Continue making Du'aa for her\nand advise her as well. Allow her to wear nice clothes, etc. but within the\nhome or under the cloak when she goes out. Be considerate and understanding\nbut at the same time, do not let up in your efforts. Do not threaten her\nwith divorce as with would have a negative effect.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
