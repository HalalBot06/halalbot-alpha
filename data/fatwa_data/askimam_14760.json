  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have been troubled off late by the points mentioned below:\n\n1. Crime ? What do we do? DO we emigrate?? Islamophobia being on the rise is there any place to go if we do emigrate2. Passing of Unislamic Laws in SA must surely attract the Azhaab of Allah i.e. same sex marriages3. Corruption in everywhere in SA!Off late thinking of these problems makes me very depressed!\n\nAny advice or naseehat that you may offer will be appreciated!\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nMuslims all around the world are faced with many challenges. There is hardly any part of the non-Muslim world free of Islamophobia. Muslims in Muslim countries are also faced with other challenges. At most, the nature of the challenges will vary. There is not a single country in the world, including Muslim countries where a person will find everything Islamic. Muslims must deal with the challenges they are faced with. Islam is complete way of life and we must live by Islam. We should analyse the cause of the challenges we face and seek solutions for them in Islam. What we are facing is nothing new. Islam is the religion of all prophets and all prophets faced challenges. They faced the challenges of their time and lived by Islam. Islamic history is filled with issues of crime and Islamophobia. It is nothing new. Dedicated Muslims lived by Islam and practiced Islam in every way. We are meant to be tested through these challenges. If those challenges were not there, our Imaan would not be tested. Allah says, “Do people think that they will be left merely claiming that we bring Imaan and not be tested?\n\n \n\n \n\nYou refer to three issues, Crime, Islamophobia and un-Islamic Laws. Crime is caused due to being materialistic. Islamophobia is due to ignorance and un-Islamic Laws being passed is due to the negligence of Muslims.\n\n \n\n \n\nMuslims need to educate themselves on Islam first. We suffer an inferiority complex and feel ashamed of our Islamic values. Islamophobia will certainly dominate in such circumstances. If we educate ourselves on Islam and understand Islam from its depths, Islamophobia will never affect such a person. Furthermore, Muslims have Islam as a religion but unfortunately we do not live by it and do not illustrate practical Islam to non-Muslims. Our bad character and conduct has actually given birth to Islamophobia. We need to reform ourselves and live by Islam. The most important solution is to make Dawah to all Muslims and non-Muslims. This is what the prophets were instructed to do to change Islamophobia and reform the environment. There is no point of being depressed.\n\n \n\n \n\nAllah has given you the understanding of knowing the wrong. Thank Allah and make others understand. If every Muslim individual does this, we could have an impact on our surroundings and free ourselves from the evils you have enumerated.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
