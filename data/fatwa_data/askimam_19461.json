  "question": "Is facebook permissible for Islamic radio stations?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n(Continuing from your article about abstaining from facebook). Is it then permissible for Islamic radio stations to use facebook and twitter?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nIt was stated in the previous article:\n\n          “You mentioned that you want to spread Deen and raise awareness of Islam. We commend you for this intention and pray that Allah, the Almighty gives you the ability to do so. However, you also mentioned that you would like to try and do this on facebook, a website based on the intermingling of the sexes and communicating with non mahram  people, which, unfortunately, some Muslims nowadays don’t consider to be a sin. They consider it to be the ‘norm’ and say that there’s nothing wrong with it...”\n\nThe same statement can be applied to this question. Many radio stations have a good intention when they initially make a facebook or twitter page, but the users and ‘fans/ followers’ are generally of a mixed gender. Therefore, if the radio station is able to ensure that there will be segregation on their website, there will be no harm in using facebook or twitter to assist the radio station. However, if someone looks at the ‘islamic’ groups on facebook or twitter, they will see that majority of the groups do not implement this and they will see the amount of unlawful interaction there is between the sexes.\n\nوَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَىٰ. ۖ وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ .ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ  إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ\n\n “And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty.” (5:2)\n\nThe shari ruling will be according to the measures taken by the radio station to ensure that their ‘page/ wall...’ is sharia compliant.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\n\nStuden Darul Iftaa\nUK\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
