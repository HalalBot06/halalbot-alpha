  "answer": "QUESTION\ni was wondering if there are anything i can do to get my du'aas and wishes come true. I know about reading surah fatiha 41 times, after fajr, as you have mentioned, and provoking allah by calling him by the name of 'wahhaab'. I can also be praying tahajjud and pray for that too... but are there anything else? is it any use of doing tasbeeh with 'ya wahhaab' and 'subhanallahi wa bihamdihi, subhanallahil azeem' before asking and making du'aa? anything else i can do to make my dua being fullfilled? i mean to get what i want?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nEvery human being wants his wishes fulfilled. However, we should not lose sight of our weakness which is addressed by Allah Allah in the Qur?aa. He says, ?You may dislike a thing whereas that is better for you, and you may like a thing whereas that is bad for you. And Allah is the Knower of everything.?\n\nWe are encouraged to make du?aa with full conviction that Allah is All-Hearing, but leave the acceptance of our du?aa to Allah. His knowledge is absolute. He knows what is best for us. At times, He may grant us whatever we ask for, or grant us something else in place of what we asked for as that is better for us according to His absolute knowledge. The wisdom behind the decisions of Allah may not be well comprehended by us. Therefore, continue making du?aa and be rest assured that Allah is Hearing and granting whatever is best for us.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
