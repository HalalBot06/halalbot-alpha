  "question": "I am working as a security Guard for a company. I am required to monitor all traffic going in and out of the gates. I have 2 questions regarding this. I have been able to perform my fardh salat",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamu alaikum Mufti Sahib I have obtained permission from my supervisor to take about five minutes to pray. 1)I barely have enough time to make wudhu and pray my fardh salat, alhamdulillah I have been able to perform my fardh salat. However it is not possible to perform the sunnah muakadah.I was wondering if that is ok? 2) When I am praying during my job I sometimes look out of the corner of my eyes to see if anyone is approaching the gate, is that ok?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We suggest you try to change your shift times to accommodate your Salat\ntimes. If this is not possible, try and start your shift with Wudhu. At\nleast, the Wudhu time will be saved from the allotted five minutes. Also,\nrequest for an additional 3 - 4 minutes. Insha Allah, this would leave you\nwith ample time for your Sunnats as well. It is sinful to omit the\nSunnat-e-Muakkadah without a valid excuse.\n2. Looking through the corner of eyes is permitted whilst in Salaat.\nHowever, take care not to turn your neck to look.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
