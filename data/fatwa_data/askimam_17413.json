  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n\nAssalamu alaikum,\nI am an international student in UK from Bangladesh. I am studying in BA Hons. 2nd year. From the last Ramadan i am trying to practice Islam accordingly.I am trying to pray 5 time salah,Tahajjud,and other Nafl prayers. Reading Quran with meaning and doing Dikr. For last few days i am feeling some different and difficult things,i got fear of death deeply,feeling bad with all types of Fitna that i can not avoid because of the social environment.I could not concentrate on my studies(study of this world),everytime i feel like crying in fear of Allah swt.I want to know about Quran and Hadith more deeply,and want to live my life according to Quran and Sunnah totally by studying related subjects. On the other side i dont know how my parent will react at that matter because they have spent a lot of money on my studies.I dont want to disrespect my parents by not giving their proper respect according to Quran and Hadith.But i am ready to take a difficult decision inshallah and also will convince my parents inshallah.Please help me to take the right decision no matter how difficult it will be.I will do anything to seek mercy from Allah swt inshallah.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAlhamdulillah, it is very pleasing to learn of your newfound zest for Islam and increased spirituality. May Allah keep you steadfast. There is no need for you to abandon your secular studies in order to maintain your piety and increase your Islamic knowledge. You should consider completing your studies since you have dedicated so much time and effort thus far. Inshallah, you can also use the very skills and knowledge that you have learned to assist the Muslim Ummah. Furthermore, you should encourage and assist other Muslims in your university and locality to become closer to Allah. After you have completed your secular studies, if you feel that you want to enrol in a full-time Madrasah, then you should do so then. In the meantime, you should search for some local ‘Ulamā who can assist you in fulfilling your thirst for more Islamic knowledge. They can probably offer you some part time / weekend classes which will enhance your Imān and A‘māl. Moreover, in order to maintain and increase your zeal, try to spend some free time in Jamā’at.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nMl. Yusuf bin Yaqub,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\nDarul Iftaa"
