  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAlhumdllah I'm Hanfi, I been told by salafi that it is not right to fully answer salam to Bidati/innovaor as per ibn Baz shaikh. Is that true we shouldn't we only say them wa alikum instead of walakum asslm wr wb?.\n\nSecond Can we say Salafi an innvators in islam? as they innvated lots of things in islam like not wearing cap during salat, and turning weak hadeeth into wrong one. Which is mention by shaikh Sayf ad-Din Ahmed ibn Muhammad in the following link....http://www31.brinkster.com/ak4thanvi/090404/albani.htm\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n1.       If a bid’ati (innovator) makes salām upon a person it is necessary (wājib) to reply.\n\nAhsanul Fatāwa 8/135\n\n \n\n2.       The vast majority of scholars accept weak narrations. (Atharul Hadithis Sharif 36).  The approach of the salafis is incorrect. It is sunnah to wear a topi (hat). For a detailed discussion regarding the hat you could refer to “The crown of a believer” authored by our honourable Ustadh Mufti Husain Kadodia Saheb.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
