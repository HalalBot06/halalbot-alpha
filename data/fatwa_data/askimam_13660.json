  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nif a person get sexullay aroused from some reason but get control over it without doing anything wrong but in the process he get noticed that a drop or two are on his clothes (doesn't clear what it is). does he had to make ghusul? or by just changing clothes he perform his salat?\nif a person perform his salat in this condition what will be the remedy for it? though he continuoulsy ask forgiveness from ALLAH.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn principle, the liquid that emits from the private part when one is sexually aroused is called mazi. The ruling of mazi is that it will nullify the Wudhu only and not the ghusal.\n\nIf the mazi has soiled the under garment to the amount of the inner portion of the palm or more, it will be necessary to wash the under garment and salaah in it will not be permissible. However, if the under garment has become soiled lesser than the inner portion of the palm, salaah in it will be permissible but Makrooh.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
