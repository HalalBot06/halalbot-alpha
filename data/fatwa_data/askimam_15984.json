  "question": "I gave her one Talaaq and now we want to reconcile",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nA few months ago, my wife and I got divorced.  She had asked me for a divorce, so we sat down and discussed the conditions and so forth.  At the end of the discussion, I chose to divorce her. \n\nNow, however, I have been wanting to remarry her.  We have passed the idaat, so a nikah would have to be performed. \n\nShe says that since I didn't tell her to shape up or or change any behavior or else she would get divorced (or that I would revoke the divorce if she satisfied certain conditions), that because of that her opinion is that the divorce is final (Talaq al-Bain).  I do not agree.  Also, I admit that I had no intention at the time of getting back together with her, but from what I've read I don't understand that to constitute talaq al-bain, so I am writing to you to see if it does.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nYou have issued your wife only one talaq. If you wish to reconcile with your ex-wife, you may do so by re-performing the Nikah. Your wife’s claim that the one talaq – bain is final as you dud not make the talaq a conditional one, is incorrect.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
