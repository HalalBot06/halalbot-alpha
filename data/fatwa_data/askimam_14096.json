  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) I have few thousand dollars in my checking account for past few years, I do not collect interest on that amount. The reason is \"taking interest is Haram\". I used to get interest and give it to poor with no intension to earn reward until then I stop taking the interest due to an Alim said this \"taking interest is Haram\". My question is 1) Is I am allow to take interest and give it to poor to help them with out the intension of earning rewards or I keep the money in same way and do not take interest. This way bank makes the money.\n\n2) If a Muslim friend who works in a bank or in an insurance company invites us for meal, what we should do? Can we go and give some many to Sadqa (rough price of meal).\n\n3) When Muslim departs should we say Wassalam or Assalama Alay kum or Allah hafiz or Feeamanullah or what is the Shariah in this regard we should say?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. It is not permissible to open interest accruing bank accounts. If due to extreme necessity, a person opens an interest accruing bank account, then it will be necessary to remove the interest money accrued from the bank and give it away as charity (without intention of reward). (Fataawa Hindiya vol.5 pg.349)\n\n2. If the host’s only source of income is from the bank/insurance company, then it will not be permissible to attend such an invitation. If the host also earns from a Halaal avenue and his Halaal earnings supercede his Haraam (earnings), it will be permissible to attend such an invitation. However, it will still be better if the host earns from both Halaal and Haraam sources and both the Halaal and Haraam are equal, or the Haraam earnings are more, then it will not be permissible to attend to such an invitation. (Ibid vol.4). If the host has both Halaal and Haraam wealth in his possession and he informs the guest of the food being from pure Halaal, then to attend to such an invitation will be permissible. (Ibid)\n\n3. It is preferable for a Muslim to make Salaam when he departs. (Sunan Abi Dawud)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
