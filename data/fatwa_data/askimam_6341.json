  "question": "Who should we curse more for the genocide in Gujrat, the fascist Hindus who are the enemies of Islam, or the Muslim governments, for not even opening their mouths, FORGET doing something about it.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is clear that the Hindus are oppressing the Muslims and the Muslim\ngovernments are negligent in coming to the defense of the Muslims, but there\nis no point in cursing the Hindus or the Muslim governments. That will not\nsolve the problems of the victims.\n\nEvery Muslim should assist his/her oppressed Muslim brother/sister in any\npossible way. That includes, financially by giving Sadaqah and charity to\nthe poor and needy victims. Du'aa should also be made that Allah remove them\nfrom their plight and misery.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
