  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat are the virtures of the Chast Namaaz and during what time can it be read. Jazakallah Khaira.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe virtues of Chaast Salaat (Salaat al-Dhuhaa) are many. In one Hadith, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, ?That person who performs 2 Rakaats of Chaast Salaat, he will not be counted from among the neglectful ones and the one who performs 4 Rakaats of Chaast he will be recorded from the worshippers and the one that reads 6 Rakaats, it will suffice for him on behalf of any optional act for that day and the one that performs 8 Rakaats, Allah will count him to be from among the obedient ones and the one the performs 12 Rakaats Allah will build for him a house in Jannah.? (Al-Tabrani)\n\nThe best time to read Chast is when quarter of the day has passed, otherwise it could be read from after sunrise uptil before midday. (Tahawi pgs.395-596)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
