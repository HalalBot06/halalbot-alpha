  "answer": "QUESTION\n2) In one of the Jumuah prayers I had finished reciting the 'durood shareef' when the Imam did salam, is my prayer incomplete? (as I also did the salam at the same time as the Imam and did not finish my recitation). Please can you explain your answer 3)When standing up from rukoo can the words \"SamiAllahu Liman Hameeda\" be recited without any additional words? 4) Is making up for the prayers one never used to pray fard or sunnah? 5) Is it adviseable to use your fingers as oppossed to a tasbeeh (after prayer)?, also what dua can be recited at when using the tasbeeh.(can the 4 quls be read?) 6) Is reading the Ayatul Kursi after each fard salat the most adviseable dua to read? Your co operation is greatly appreciated.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There is no restriction in the sitting posture during the Jumu?ah Khutbah. One may sit in any posture one is comfortable with as long as one listens attentively to the Khutbah.\n\n2. If you did not complete the Durood Shareef when the Imaam made salaam and you made salaam with the Imaam, your Salaat is complete.\n\n3. The Muqtadi (follower) should recite ?Rabbanaa lakal hamd? when standing up from Ruku, while the Imaam recites ?Sami?allaahu liman hamidah? and when in the Qawmah (upright position), it is advisable to recite ?Hamdan katheeran tayyiban mubaarakan feeh?.\n\n4. It is Fardh to make Qadhaa (make up) for the missed Fardh and Waajib Salaats.\n\n5. Using the fingers to count does not have any special virtue. It is just a means which is similar to using a Tasbeeh.\n\n6. There is great virtue in reciting Aayaatul Kursi after Fardh Salaat. Other Du?aas may also be read ? refer below.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahi"
