  "question": "Regarding question 994 about Milad. You quoted an islamic organization which says it is bidat and not allowed. Is that your opinion?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am now confused. Milad is held very high amongst the Sufi's and you have stated that tasawwuf is an integral part of Islam. On top of that many scholars say Milad is allowed and praiseworthy. I am confused as to why you did not answer this question yourself and instead quoted from another Islamic organization?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSufism is indeed an integral part of Islam. However, any practise against\nShari'ah cannot be tolerated even if practiced by Sufis.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
