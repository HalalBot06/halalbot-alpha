  "answer": "QUESTION\nmy husband is a hardworking, loving man; he prays 5 times a day and reads yaseen regularly but he drinks alcohol at night.Plz prescribe a dua to enable giving up of the drinking habit. He was into this habit before marriage. Whenever i do send u a question i do not get the question posted to my e- mail address and sometimes the answers to my questions reach my mail box but do not appear on your site.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlcohol is Haraam. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?No person drinks whilst he is a believer.? (Mishkaat pg.17)%0D%0A%0D%0ADu?aa is the greatest weapon that can assist a believer but together with that one needs to take the necessary steps and actions. Hence, you should try and explain to him the evils of alcohol more especially stressing to him the command of Allah Ta?ala regarding alcohol. Allah Ta?ala says, ?O you who believe! Intoxicants (all types of alcoholic drinks) and gambling and al-Ansaab (animals sacrificed for idols, etc.) and al-Azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytaan?s handiwork, so avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.? (Surah Maaidah Aayat90).%0D%0A%0D%0ARemind him that alcohol is as filthy as urine, that if it falls on the clothing, it has to be compulsorily washed. If you cannot then let some elders of your family or some respectable person in your community speak to him confidently. Try out all other methods to discourage him from such an evil habit. Also, ask Allah Ta?ala to assist you and to guide your husband. You may ask Allah Ta?ala in any language and any way taking into consideration all the etiquettes of Du?aa.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0Afor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
