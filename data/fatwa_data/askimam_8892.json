  "question": "Insight into dream...I have a white, fatty substance inside my mouth (attached) which I am always able to tear off with my hands and/or by biting it off and then throwing away",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have been having this dream for the past few years and about 3 to 4 times a year. While the dream takes place in different situations the theme is always the same. I have a white, fatty substance inside my mouth (attached) which I am always able to tear off with my hands and/or by biting it off and then throwing or spitting it away, the substance feels unclean and I want to get rid of it in private. The dream leaves me feeling uneasy. It will be appreciated if you could guide me to a correct understanding of this dream by Allah's will.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream has no significance/ however, you should take care of two things:\n\n1. The food that enters your mouth should be clean and pure. The money with which the food is bought should not be contaminated with Haraam sources.\n\n2. You should be careful of your utterances. It must not be that people are harmed by your words.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
