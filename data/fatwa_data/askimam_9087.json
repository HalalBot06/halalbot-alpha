  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan you please shed some light on the following hadith from 'Sahih Muslim' Book 41, #6924. Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The Last Hour would not come until the Romans would land at al-A'maq or in Dabiq. An army consisting of the best (soldiers) of the people of the earth at that time will come from Medina (to counteract them)?.. They will then fight and a third (part) of the army would run away, whom Allah will never forgive. A third (part of the army). which would be constituted of excellent martyrs in Allah's eye, would be killed ani the third who would never be put to trial would win and they would be conquerors of Constantinople. And as they would be busy in distributing the spoils of war (amongst themselves) after hanging their swords by the olive trees, the Satan would cry: The Dajjal has taken your place among your family. They would then come out, but it would be of no avail. And when they would come to Syria, he would come out while they would be still preparing themselves for battle drawing up the ranks? 1.Constantinople has already been conquered,no Dajjal appeared though. 2.The appearance of Dajjal according to this Hadith is suppose to be in a time where muslims are still using Swords as weapons:'hanging their swords by the olive trees',if he is to appear in future times one would excpect the use of more sophisticated weaponary than what is around today.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Constantinople having been conquered already does not negate the possibility of it going back in the control of the Kuffaar once more. (refer Takmilah Fathul Mulhim vol.6 pg.296). A Muslim is supposed to have complete conviction on the words of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), even though the apparent meaning may be far fetched.\n\n2. Although the Hadith makes mention of swords, it could be that it refers to weaponry, in general. Obviously, if the sophisticated weaponry of today were to be mentioned, the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) would have not been able to understand and fathom its meaning. And it is also possible that the weapons used in that war would be actual swords. Nothing is difficult on Almighty Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
