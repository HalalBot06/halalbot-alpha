  "answer": "QUESTION\nassalamu'alaikum wr. wb.\n\nRespected mufti shahib..\n\n1. I have a few questions in regard to zakat.\nSay the nisab of zakat is $1000, and My wife has gold (which she doesn't wear) equal to $500 (throughout the year). She also have some land inheritade from her father, which has not been distributed yet and therefore it's not clear how many meters is her part.\nOn the other hand, I have some deposit money amount to $300 (the balance at the end of 1 year), a car which I use every day value to $3500, a house which I live in value to $5000. I have my salary but it always used up for our monthly expenses.\nOn the top of that I have some inheritance from my late father and mother in terms of land (2500 m2) and 3 houses . 1 house is in rental for $1600 / year, another house we rent the rooms to people, which gives profit (at the end of the year) of $300, and another house is just empty. These houses are supposed to be distributed among the three of us, but my brothers have not been able to do that yet.\nDo we have to calculate zakat for each individual or can we combine both of our wealth ?\nWhich property is zakatable ?\nHow much do I have to pay for the zakat for each year ?\nWe really need your response asap as the time is getting close to pay the zakat..\n\n2. Is khutbah for Ied the same as for jum'ah (2 times, with sitting in between). please explain the detail of khutbah for ied...\n3. Do we have to pay income for our monthly income?\n\njazakallaah\n\nwassalamu'alaikum wr. wb.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\n1)      Both of you, husband and wife will calculate your Zakat separately. If the nisaab of Zakat is $1000 and your wife has jewellery for $500, then the jewelry is not Zakatable if she does not have atleast $500 cash to make up the nisaab.\n\nYou do not have to pay Zakat on your living house, car and monthly salary.\n\nYou will pay Zakat on the cash $300 and your share of the inheritance from the rentals if the amount equals to $1000, or more.\n\n2)      The Khutbah for Eid is same as Jummah Khutba. However, the Eid Khutbah will be after Eid Salah and the Takbirs in the Eid Khutba should be recited a few times.\n\n3)      Refer to No1.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm. Also 10:00am everyday, Q/A 2:00pm and after Asr Majlis 5:15pm. All times are according to British standard times."
