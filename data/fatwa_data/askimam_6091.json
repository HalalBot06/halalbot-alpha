  "question": "My (house)wife is concerned that since I am the earner, I am the one who gets all the reward for giving money in charity, while she does not. Is this true?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, we should understand that Allah Ta'ala's mercy knows no%0D%0Alimits. Allah Ta'ala rewards a person on the basis of the most insignificant%0D%0Aand minutest of actions. This is solely based on one's intentions. A person%0D%0Awho merely intends at heart to do good is rewarded fully on the basis of his%0D%0Aintention even though he was unable to do the action.%0D%0A%0D%0ASimilarly, here in your case, you have enough wealth to spend in charity so%0D%0Ayou will be rewarded if you spend. If your wife does not have wealth to%0D%0Aspend in charity but she makes this intention at heart that if she had%0D%0Awealth, she would have spent it in charity, then she is also being rewarded%0D%0Afully by Allah Ta'ala on the basis of her pure intentions.%0D%0A%0D%0ANevertheless, in all cases the wife earns tremendous amount of reward even%0D%0Athough she does not physically prepares for her husband, the dishes that she%0D%0Awashes and all the other chores is in reality charity and will earn lots of%0D%0Areward for her.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
