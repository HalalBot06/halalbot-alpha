  "question": "Dear Mufti Saheb, What is the status of belief of the the Scholars on Imam Ibn Taymiyyah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShaykh Taqi-u-ddin Ahmad ibn Taymiyah was a prominent Aalim (scholar) of Deen. Shaykh Taqi-u-ddin had his independent views on many matters based on his vast knowledge and research. It is incorrect for non-scholars and non-academics to pass a judgment especially on such learned people. They should fear Allah and abstain from engaging themselves in such discussions. Differences of opinion is a salient feature among the Ulama-e-Haqq (true scholars). and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai FATWA DEPT."
