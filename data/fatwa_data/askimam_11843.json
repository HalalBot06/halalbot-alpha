  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Fatwa that we viewed on the www.shariahboard.com website clearly states that usage of a digital camera is not permissible. We concur with this ruling.\n\nWhile we do not know Mufti Nawal Saheb personally, the biography given on the website shows him to be a very senior, high ranking Mufti, who studied under great luminaries and benefited from their company.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
