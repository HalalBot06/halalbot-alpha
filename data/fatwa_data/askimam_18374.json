  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a question regarding which I would like your guidance. For example, take the Salat of Asar. It has four farz Rakat. Suppose I join the congregational prayer in the 4th(last) rakat and when the Imam says salam, I again stand up and start my 2nd rakat. In this rakat I will start from subhan allaha then sura fatiyah and then sura Ikhlas. After that I will recite Ata hiyat and then I will again stand up for the 3rd Rakat. Now, my question is that will I recite only one sura i-e sura Fatiyah in this 3rd Rakat or will also recite sure Ikhlas because in the forth Rakat when I joined, sura Ikhlas was not recited and overall I am one sura short. On the other hand, If I will recite only one sura in the 3rd rakat then what would be the case in the last rakat? Will I again recite only one sura?\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nIn the specific scenario mentioned in your query, you will recite Surah Fatihah and another Surah in the third rakah. Thereafter, in the last rakah you will recite only Surah Fatihah and will not add another Surah with it.\n\n \n\n(Fatawa Rahimiyah, 5/ 154, Isha’at)\n\nويقضي أول صلاته في حق قراءة ، وآخرها في حق تشهد ؛ فمدرك ركعة من غير فجر يأتي بركعتين بفاتحة وسورة وتشهد بينهما ، وبرابعة الرباعي بفاتحة فقط.\n(رد المحتار، 1/ 596-597، سعيد)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
