  "answer": "QUESTION\nHAIR TRANSPLANT SURGERY\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nHAIR TRANSPLANT SURGERY\n\nMedically speaking:-\n\nHair transplantation is a surgical technique that involves moving skin containing hair follicles from one part of the body (the donor site) to bald or balding parts (the recipient site). It is primarily used to treat male pattern baldness, whereby grafts containing hair follicles that are genetically resistant to balding are transplanted to bald scalp.\n\nSince hair naturally grows in follicles that contain groupings of 1 to 4 hairs, today’s most advanced techniques transplant these natural occurring 1 – 4 hair \"follicular units\" in their natural groupings. Thus modern hair transplantation can achieve a natural appearance by mimicking nature hair for hair. This recent hair transplant procedure is called \"Follicular Unit Transplantation.\"\n\nThe loss of hair is a problem that dates far back in time- as far as 3500 BC where legendary figures like Julius Caesar struggled with hair fixations.\n\nAccording to studies 60-70% of men struggle with baldness and hair loss, while a much smaller proportion of women have the same problem.\n\nScientists are still researching and trying to find the exact causes of hair loss, but the most general (and proven) are caused by hereditary factors. Unfortunately, this does not mean that if ones parents aren't bald that baldness won't happen. According to studies, this is due to spontaneous mutation which happens when genetic information changes at conception. Other causes of hair loss can be due to any traumatic events, surgery, radiation, drugs and diseases.\n\nThe permanent hair restoration or hair loss treatment is a surgical hair transplant procedure. The latest advances in hair transplant surgery have made this procedure far more appealing thanks to the far less artificial results which can now be anticipated.\n\nThe Micrograft Hair Transplant is the result of the latest developments in this field. This technique uses smaller hair grafts in greater numbers, resulting in an attractive natural look.\n\nJust to give clients an idea what exactly this hair transplant process entails: A thin strip of hair, attached to the skin, is taken from the 'donor' area - usually the back or sides of the patient's own head. This is repeated until the required number of hair grafts has been harvested. In the second step of the procedure, the surgeon makes a number of tiny incisions - one per hair graft - into the bald area and transplants the grafts into these.\n\nThe length of the procedure varies depending on the size of the area to be treated - anywhere from 2 to 7 hours!\n\nDO YOU REALLY NEED A HAIR TRANSPLANT??\n\nIslam prohibits us from unnecessarily interfering or tampering with our bodies. This falls under the forbidden category of mutilation or distortion of Allah’s creation, which has been spoken of as a project Shaytaan is committed to engaging humankind in.\n\nExamples of such tampering and interference are face lift, changing the colour of our skin through surgery, likewise, and adding a cluster of false hair to one’s hair. The Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘alayhi Wassalam):\n\n“Allah curses women who patch up (their natural) hair with another patch of hair or women who receive such work!” [Recorded in Sahih Bukhari]\n\nGenerally it is understood that hair transplantation is the redistribution of your naturally growing hair. Hair follicles growing in areas of greater density at the back of the head are transplanted to areas that are bald. If balding is regarded as a defect, then this method of transplant will be permissible.\n\nThe permissibility is because this comes under the heading of restoring that which Allah has created, or correcting a fault; it does not come under the heading of cosmetic procedures or adding to what Allah Ta’ala has created, rather it is restoring something that is lacking or removing a fault.  \n\nHair transplantation by means of one’s own natural hair as well as artificial hair is considered permissible.  However, this should be restricted to cases of necessity when a person suffers real psychological or social pains. We would like to stress an important point here, which is related to the fact that the door of permissibility in such area cannot be left wide open.\n\nHaving said this, however, it is important to state that Islam is not at all opposed to resorting to treatments or medications in order to enhance Allah’s creation without in any way altering or mutilating it. Hair transplantation of one’s own natural hair in such a way that it would grow and take roots on one’s head is also considered permissible.\n\nIt is also permissible to resort to treatments or medications that help natural growth of hair just as we are allowed to take medications in order to enhance our eye sight or physical stamina, etc.”\n\nThere have been reports from some patients who have not found the transplant successful. It is therefore advisable if patients consult an experienced dermatologist or hair specialist and seek out alternative methods. One such alternative method is treating the hair [including the bald areas] with some type of hair-growing cream or ointment. This would be preferred to undergoing of transplant surgery.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMl.
