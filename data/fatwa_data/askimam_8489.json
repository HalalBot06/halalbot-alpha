  "answer": "QUESTION\nI recently saw a picture in the newspaper where a shia man in iraq was holding up a painting that was said to be of Hazrat Ali (radiallahu an). Do pictures of the sahaba exist? I am very scpetical about this because if the is a painting of hazrat ali (ra) why is there not one of our beloved nabi Muhammed (sallalahu alayi wasalam)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) prohibited drawing pictures and making images of animate objects.\n\nIt is impossible that the Sahaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum), the Taabi?een (RA) or the Taabi?e Taabi?een will commit a prohibited act and draw the image of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), Hadhrat Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu) or any Sahaabi.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
