  "answer": "QUESTION\nI started mastrubating a year ago, and when I found out it's haraam, I still didn't give much thought to it and considered it less of a sin than fornication or casual sex. Then later on I read more about it and wanted to stop. But everytime I tell myself \"I am not going to do this\", I end up doing it by listening to this little voice in my head \"don't worry it's okay\" ...I totally hate it, I want to stop but I can't seem to find a way PLEASE HELP! I feel terrible I've asked for repentance many times and I wonder if Allah will grant me after all the times I've tried...\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is incorrect of you to make a statement depicting your loss of hope in\nAllah's forgiveness. Allah forgives even if the sins are equal to the foam\nof the Seas. Continue repenting from your sins.\n\nThe revulsion you harbour for the sin is the main part of the battle. Half\nthe battle is won. Now, you should exercise will power and whenever you are\ntempted to do so, you should visualize that Allah is watching you. Also,\ncontinue making Du'aa and beg Allah to assist you.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
