  "question": "I secretly visit my mother by lying to my husband and he has found out. He no longer trusts me and keeps me from going out anywhere now. I feel trapped and I think the treatment I am getting is unfair",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am married now for a year and a half and am expecting now. I live with my husband and in laws. I have lied to my hsband in the past about going to visit my mother because our family do not get along. My husband and in laws have forbidden my mother to come over to see me or to call here. As a result I got my own cellphone so my mother and I could keep in touch. I secretly visit my mother by lying to my husband and he has found out. He no longer trusts me and keeps me from going out anywhere now. I feel trapped and I think the treatment I am getting is unfair. My husband also gets very angry and has a bad temper along with the rest of his family. He says mean things and emotionally abuses me. What should I do as I don't feel comfortable here and don't want to return after I deliver my baby which is any day now...\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. You have a right to live on your own without any interference from your in-laws. We suggest you discuss this very politely with your husband and explain the emotional trauma you are suffering.\n\n2. Also, it is very cruel of him to prevent your mother visiting you without any just cause. Perhaps, he has a reason for preventing her.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
