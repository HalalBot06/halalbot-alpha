  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMalfooz: A strange Muslim who doesn’t want a Masjid to be built\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nA person once narrated an incident to Hazrat. He said “There was a dispute between Hindus and Muslims regarding a masjid. One Muslim; Jamaluddin supported the Hindus and said I am happy to pray at home, therefore there is no need to build a Masjid”. Hazrat stated that his name should be Zawaluddin (the eradicator of deen). One person then mentioned that Jamaluddin is bay’ah to such and such a Pīr. Hazrat replied that what effect can this customary pledge (bay’ah) have? People give Pīrs a bad name.\n\n Hazrat mentioned “What a sad state of affairs it is that this person being a Muslim is against the building of a Masjid. After hearing these kinds of things we should fear the wrath of Allah Ta’ala."
