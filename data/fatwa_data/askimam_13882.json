  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy sister wants to know a good female Muslim baby name. She has been looking for names online, but we do not know which website is reliable and which one is not. We want to be ensured that we name her daughter something which has good meaning and is also easy to pronounce since we live in the USA. Could you please kindly give any suggestions for girls names and/or suggest any reliable websites that we could use to find baby names.\n\nAlso, we would like to know the meanings of  these names: Tania, Areej, and  Alishba. Jazakallah Khair!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere is a book compiled by Rafiq Abdur-Rehman by the name of ‘Treasury of Muslim Names’. Here are a few names: Farida – unique, precious; Fawziyah – successful; Haleemah – compassionate; Haseenah – beautiful; Humayrah – red (name of Aaisha [radhiallaahu anha]); Karimah – noble; Malikah – Queen; Malikah – queen; Nabeelah – noble; Najma – star; Ridwanah – delight; Yumna – rightsided\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
