Third edition)\n\nIt is best to keep the names of the Sahāba, Anbiyā, and pious predecessors.  Here under are a few names of our pious predecessors:\n\nAdam, Sheeth, Sulaiman, Esa, Musa, Yunus, Ismail, Zakariyya, Ayub, Yahya, Ilyas, Sālih, Muhammed (Alāhimussalām)\n\nThe above are a few names of the Ambiyā.        \nThe following are the names of a few Sahāba (Radiyallāhuanhum ajmaīn):\nAbu-Bakr, Umar, Uthmān, Ali, Hasan, Husain, Ja`far, Jābir, Abdur Rahman, Zubaīr, Sa`d.\n\n2) It is not permissible to watch these videos due to the many Harām elements which exist within them.\n\n3) The amount of 612.35 grams of silver or 87.479 grams of gold or cash to that value is called Nisāb of Zakāt. (Minimum amount to be in possession for the liability of paying Zakāt).\n For example, if the price of silver is quoted at A$ 4.40 per gram then the Nisāb will equal approximately to A$ 2.702.\n\n If the money in your bank account is equivalent to the value of Nisāb or more than the Nisāb amount, and this remains in your possession for a complete lunar year, it will be Wājib upon you to give Zakāt at a rate of 2.5% of the total amount in possession at the end of the lunar year.\n\n(Hāshiyatut Tahtāwiy, Pg.714, Ilmiya) [1]\n\nIf you had possessed money equivalent to the value of Nisāb for a time less than a lunar year, there after this amount decreased to less than the Nisāb and after a time within the lunar year it returned to the original amount or more; in this case also Zakāt will have to be paid.\n\n(Badā`i us Sanā`i, Pg. 387 Vol.2 Ilmiya)[2]\n\nFor example: if you had Nisāb amount at the beginning of the lunar year and you possessed that until six months into the lunar year, thereafter it decreased to less than the Nisāb amount for 2 months, then it increased above the Nisāb amount and remained at or above the Nisāb till the end of the lunar year then you will have to pay Zakāt on the whole amount at the end of the lunar year. \n\n(Behisti Zewar, Pg.297, Vol.1)\n \n\nIf the value of your wife’s jewellery is equal to the Nisāb, or more than she will have to pay 2.5% of the total amount.\n\nYou could also refer to Fatwa #17114 on the Ask Imam site for further clarity.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl. Muhammed Sindhi,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā\n\nا فرضت على حر مسلم مكلف  ما لك لنصاب  من نقد او تبرا ...... فارغ عن الدين و عن حاجته الاصلية (كثيابه المحتاج اليها..و كالنفقة و دور السكنى ...فاذا كان عنده دراهم اعدها لهاذه الاشياء و حال عليه الحول لا تجب فيها الزكاة (كتاب الزكاة)   \n\n و عندنا نقصان النصاب فى خلال الحول لا يقطع الحول [2]"
