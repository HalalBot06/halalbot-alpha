  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy parents have some debts around Indian Rs.80000, insha allah on their behalf this debts would be repaid back by me in another 8 months. My wife has some jewellery around 150gm which are in use by her. My question is as a husband whether I need to pay zakat on this jewellery as I alone would be performing my hajj this year, whether I need to pay zakat before my hajj travel.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Zakaat on the Jewellery of your wife does not have to be paid by you. If\nthe Zakaat on the jewellery has become Fardh, then it has to be discharged\nby your wife. However, you may discharge the Zakaat of your wife with her\nprior consent.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
