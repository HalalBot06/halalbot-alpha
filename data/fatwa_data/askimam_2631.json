  "question": "What is the Sharâ€™ee ruling of determining characteristics of people through the zodiacal signs?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Zodiacal signs evolved from the ancient Babylonia and moved into China, India, the West, etc. They in turn added their traditions and practices to it. Being conceptualised by man and based on traditions and myths that are man made, it cannot be used to make a judgement that people born under the same sign share the same or similar characteristics.\n\nZodiacal signs being the tools of fortune-tellers and soothsayers rules out the use of these signs as stated in a Hadith ?Whoever goes to a fortuneteller or soothsayer and believes in what he says then he has disbelived in what has been revealed to Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). (Mishkaat pg.393; Qadeemi)\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
