  "question": "Is it permissible to listen to the Qur'an (audio tapes, etc.) when involved in other activities (assignments, reading, etc.)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen the Qur?aan is recited, it is compulsory to listen attentively. It is not permissible to play an audio tape of the recitation of the Qur?aan while engaged in other activities. That diverts one?s attention from listening to the Qur?aan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
