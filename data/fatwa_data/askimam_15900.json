  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have Eczema and slight Vitiligo ( whitening of the skin) could you please prescribe me some form of dua, as i  believe in the power of dua and Allah swt. Please reply back as i have checked you forum and there is no question present which answers my question.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe power of dua is great and mighty. Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said, “If there is anything that could change taqdeer, it is dua”.\n\nHowever, we are living in a world of means. At times, it is compulsory for us to adopt means. Allah then puts effects in the means we adopt. You should consult a skin specialist and adopt all possible means for your care and also make dua to Allah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
