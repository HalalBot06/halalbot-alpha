  "question": "Is it true that Wudu gets broken, if one touches their private parts with their bare hands?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n* If this is the case, then when performing Ghusl, if one makes wudu at the start, and happens to touch the private parts during the course of the shower (of which a good possibility exists), this will have to be repeated. * Also, what is the definition of private parts? Does this include the bottoms (butts), and for women their bosoms? When putting on clothes, again there is a strong possibility of touching these.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the majority Madhaahib, touching of the private parts does not\ninvalidate the Wudhu. This is only according to the Shaaf'ee Madhab.\n\nAccording to the Shaaf'ee Madhab, if a person, male or female, touches the\nfront or hind private parts, the Wudhu is invalidated.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
