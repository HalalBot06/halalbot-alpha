  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaikum Mufti saab,\n\nJazakallah Khair for providing this service of helping us to know\n\nabout things in Islam.\n\n1. I want to know that what is the criteria for walking in front of a person who is praying salat.\n\n2. I heard that we should not eat the products containing some E--- (Like E101 etc.) could you please\n   about this.\n3. Can women go to mosque/others homes and pray taraweeh prayer like most people do in Saudi and India.\n4. Now I am in saudi Arabia, here I noticed one strange thing, from my previous knowledge I read and heard from sholars that if we want\n\nto go to Makkah and Madina we should make intention (Niyyat) for makkah (to do omrah or tawaf or for salat because we get one lakh\n\najar) and for madina (to do ziyarat and to do salam or to pray salat because here we get 50000 ajar). The strange yhing which i observed\n\nhere is that in ramazan people use to go to harmain for finish of quran in taraweeh usually on 28th ramazan and many poeple made this\n\nas tradition and they go by making intention for completion of quran only. I want to ask that is this a biddat. Or is it allowed.\n\nJazakallah Khair.\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram\n\n \n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\n \n\nIt is not permissible to walk anywhere in front of a person performing Salaah in a small Musjid. In a big Musjid, one may walk beyond the area of sight of a person performing Salaah. This is generally the area of two normal Saffs. In a very big Musjid, like the Haram in Makkah Mukarramah, one may walk in front of a Musallie. In the preceding two situations, it is advisable to exercise restraint from passing in front of a Musallie to the best of ones ability. In one Hadith, Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said “if one knew the burden of passing in front of a Musallie, he would prefer standing and waiting for 100 years. The size of a small Musjid is 235 square meters or less (Ahsanul Fataawa Vol. 3 Pg. 409 H M Saeed).\n\nWe are based in . You may refer this query to some reliable Halaal certifying body in your country.\n\nIt is better for a woman to perform all her Salaah Fardh, Nafl, Tarawih at home. If there is fitnah in going to the Musjid, then she should not go. It is a well-known fact, that we are in times of fitnah and immorality.\n\nThe completion of the Quraan in Tarawih is an auspicious occasion. It is a moment of acceptance of Duas. That auspiciousness is even greater in the Haram of Makkah. Those that go on the 28 Ramadaan to join the completion of the Quraan and to join in the Dua upon the completion of the Quraan. It is not an act of Bidah.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
