  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nDarul Uloom Deoband (also other institutions based on Darul Uloom Deoband ideologies) is sourced and referred to often. Inevitably, Deoband is based on the teachings of the Noble Qur'an and Sunnah of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) as well as the illustrious Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu √Ånhum)\n\nThe Barelwi / Deobandi issue is an age-old difference which should have been buried a long time ago, but unfortunately some people will resort to mud-slinging. May Allah Ta'ala guide all of us on the right path.\n1. You may refer to 'Mutalia Barelwi' by Dr. Allama Khalid Mahmood\n2. 'Who Are the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaa' by Mufti AH Elias\n3. 'Deoband Se Barelwi Tak' by Moulana Abu Awsaf\n4. 'Barelwi Fitna ka Naya Roup' by Muhammad Arif\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
