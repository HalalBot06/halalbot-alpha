  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissible in Islam to have birth control? If yes, how can it be done without having recourse to medecines?\n\nWe have decided not to have a baby right now for we want to construct a house of our own.Is it valid reason for not having a baby or whether it is obligatory to have children once we are married.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYour reason for not having a baby is incorrect. Your reason alludes that having a baby will be a financial burden as you will not be able to construct a house.\n\nAllah is the Provider and He will provide for you as well as the baby.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
