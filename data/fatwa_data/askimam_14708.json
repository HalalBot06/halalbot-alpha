  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDear Mufti Sahib\n\nAssalam-o-Alaikum!\n\nI am studying in Seoul (Korea). Here a lot of Muslims of different origins and backgrounds form a small muslim community. There are some questions that are causing me confusion regarding this.\n\n1. We pray Jumaa in the university. The Imam is from Ahl-e-Hadith and he gives Khutba in english whereas I heard in one of Maulana Taqi Usmani's lectures that it is compulsory to give Khutba in Arabic. When I told our Imam, he told me of a Syrian mufti who allowed him to do so.\n\n2. Many Ahl-e-Hadith say that Hanafi keep their hands below naval in Qayaam based on a hadeeth told by Hadrat Abdullah Ibn-e-Masood  in Sunan Abi Dawood. They say that first of all no book except the Sahih Bukhari and Sahi Muslim should be followed. They also say that Hadrat Abdullah Ibn-e-Masood did not consider Surat Aala and Muawazatain to be a part of Quran. So we shouldn't follow his Rawayat whereas according to my knowledge Imam Abu Hanifa derived most of his knowledge from pupils of Hadrat Ibn-e-Masood\n\n3. Please give me an online source of Tafseer from a reputed Ahl-e-Sunnat aalim. I tried to find out Maarif-ul-Quran by Maulana Shafi but couldn't find it on internet.\n\nPlease clarify my confusions and make dua for me. May Allah give you Ajr-e-Azeem  \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram\n\n \n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\n \n\nAt the outset, we must acknowledge that when Muslims from different backgrounds live in one area, they are bound to differ with one another based on their training and understanding of Islam.  Muslims are brothers unto one another.  Every effort should be made to live with love and harmony.  Bonding and unity is the greatest strength of the Ummah.  The disunity in the Ummah and discords is weakening this Ummah. We should tolerate each other and manage differences according to the ethics of Islam.  It is unfortunate that when people are faced with an adverse view, they become emotional and broaden the gap of disunity.  That attitude is childish and immature.  It is a great disservice to Islam and Muslims.  Responsible people will conduct themselves in a mature way.  They uphold unity and address differences in a mature way. We have used the opportunity of this question to address this important issue for the benefit of the broader viewers of this site.  We now revert to your queries\n\nIt is compulsory to give the Friday Khutba in Arabic.  The Imam should be advised on this.  If the Imam recites a few verses of the Quran and Ahadith and Dua in Arabic, the obligation will nevertheless be fulfilled but will not accord with the obligation of rendering the entire khutba in Arabic.  If your’ll are helpless and your’ll cannot do anything beyond making a reasonable request to your Imam, your’ll will be excused\nThe Hanafis response is simple. We follow Imam Abu Hanifa.  He was a great Mufassir, Muhaddith, a great Faqih and we trust his guidance in following the Quran and Hadith.\nYou may contact Mufti Husain Kadodia Sallamahu. He is a reliable Aalim and Mufti and conducts online programmes.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\nThe guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\nEducation and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\nIslam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\nWhen one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\nMuslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\nWe have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\nIf you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\nIf that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\nRasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit”.\n\n \n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
