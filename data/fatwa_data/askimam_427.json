  "question": "Masjids have bazaar and family days to raise funds, booths are set up that sell things and men and women invited.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nGames are also played. Masjids as a fund raising have Bazaar where all are invited to buy things and play games. is this jaiz, can such money be used for the masjid. also the Maktab has a Sports day when the parents and children come together and play games, what is the ruling on this.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) says, 'Whoever imitates a nation%0D%0Ais among them.' It is an undeniable fact that today carnivals, fetes and%0D%0Aevents have become a hallmark of the non-Muslims.%0D%0A%0D%0ABesides, it is events of this nature that many laws of Allah Ta'ala are%0D%0Atransgressed, of which intermingling of the sexes is foremost. Furthermore,%0D%0Athe primary drawcard in these events is the entertainment. It is this%0D%0Afundamental point that adds to the transgression. If the donor is sincere in%0D%0Ahis purpose, he would donate his money without going there and%2For in%0D%0Aanonymity. In fact, if such people contributed their monies before-hand, it%0D%0Awould have saved the Muslim organisations from stooping to these levels.%0D%0A%0D%0AHow can such funds, derived through events where prohibited practices occur,%0D%0Acontain Barkat? How can such monies accumulated with Allah's wrath be used%0D%0Ato please Him? There were many ways in which Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) and his companions (RA) used to raise money but most definitely%0D%0Anot the fund-raising events of today.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
