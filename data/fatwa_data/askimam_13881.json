May Allah Ta'ala comfort and guide you in your loss and open the doors of happiness for you in this world and the hereafter, ameen.\n\nSister, it is pleasing to note that you are attached to Allah Ta'ala. Only He knows what tests each one of us are to undergo in our lifetime.\n\nAlhamdulillah, we have not been created in vain. You are still young and have a lifetime ahead of you, insha'allah. You are feeling your loss strongly at the moment and no doubt you have difficulty in seeing any future joy or happiness at the moment. Allah Ta'ala has not meant for us to be in a permanent state of grief and loss. My dua is that you will soon be able to experience the joys of life again, ameen.\n\nBe that as it may, if you really think that you will not be able to fulfill the rights of a husband and that marriage may make you unhappy, then perhaps it may be wise to the option of not marrying. You have to however keep in mind that there are many temptations out there and you will have to be mindful of the fact that you will have to strive to maintain your chastity as shaitaan is your greatest enemy. Do you think you will be able to meet this challenge with success? May Allah Ta'ala guide and protect you , ameen.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best.\n\nSister Fadila\nSocial dept\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
