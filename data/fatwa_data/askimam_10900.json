  "question": "Can I make life insurance of myself or some other muslim?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs some say that intrest should not be taken in islam so life insurance is not permitted. How far is it correct with respect to Quran and Hadees ? If it is not permitted, Is it permissible to make insurance to non-muslims?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe insurance schemes nowadays in vogue are structured on Ribaa and Qimaar (interest and gambling).both are heinous crimes as mentioned in the Quraan and Hadith. Insurance based products sold to non Muslims are also not permissible as this is tantamount to assisting others in sin.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI"
