  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs salaam u alikum\n \nNow a days as you may know that,  Zaid Zaman Hamid (who is the owner of Brass Tacks) are struggling for khilafa system in Pakistan.\n \nI came to know that he (Zaid Zaman Hamid ) is same person who is the follower of yousaf ali kazab (who claimed to be a propohet Muhammad, Nauzubillah).\n \nBased on above sitaution what are precautions that Muslim umma should need to take, Sould we struggle for khilafa just by following a person like Zaid Zaman Hamid ? or what\nkind of advice which you could give to MUSLIM UMMA\n \nI know this question is personally targeted some one (like Zaid Zaman Hamid), but you may also know that this is very important question for the whole young youth in Pakistan who wants islamic ways of life in Pakistan and now we all are looking towards our Ulama Karam (Muslim Scholars) in Pakistan that , how they respond to this fitna. May Allah guide us to the right path \nPlease please reply me as soon as possible so that i can also inform others about it who is just blindly following Zaid Zaman Hamid\n \nWaiting for your reply\n \nJazakAllah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIn the compilation of ahādīth a very large portion has been dedicated towards ابواب الفتن   (Abwābul fitan) or كتاب الفتن  (Kitābul fitan) where in the muhadithīn have narrated all those ahādīth which are related to the trials and tribulations. In these ahādith Nabi sallalāhu ῾alaihe wasallam has warned the ummah against all those events which will occur before Qiyāmah.\n\nIn كنزالعمال (Kanzul ῾ummāl) the most famous work of Allamah Ali Muttaqi rahimahullah, it has been narrated on the authority of Hazrat Abdullah ibn Mas῾ūd radiyallaho ῾anho,\n\n“Be cautious of the company you join and how you obtain Ilm deen. Verily, towards the end of time the devils will disguise themselves into the form of men and they will say; “حدثنا \" and “ أخبرنا   \"  therefore when you adopt someone’s  company then inquire about his name, his father’s  name and his lineage; so that you may pursue him in his absence.”\n\n(kanzul ῾ummāl vol.10, pg.214, mo’assisātur risālah ) [1]\n\nIn the light of above hadīth we understand that it is very important to identify the person we seek our legal advice/guidance from, whether he is a reliable ῾ālim or not? where did he attained his knowledge? who are his teachers? This is because anyone quoting  “اخبرنا” and “حدثنا” does not automatically qualify him to be a reliable ῾ālim. As Abdullah ibn Mubārak rahimahullah said very beautifully;\n\n“The entire deen is based on the chain of narrators, had it not been for the isnād then every person will narrates that;  what he desires”.\n\n(Muqaddimah muslim, vol.1, pg.12, Maktaba-e-thānvi Deoband) [2]\n\n \n\nAnd Muhammad bin Sirīn rahimahullah has mentioned;\n\n“Knowledge is the entire deen so beware who you obtain your deen from”.\n\n(Muqaddimah muslim, vol.1, pg.11, Maktaba-e-thānvi Deoband) [3]\n\nWe have conducted a research on “Zaid Zaman Hamid” and we concluded that there is     sufficient information about him on:\n\nwww.nazmay.com\n\nhttp://smhumayun.blogspot.com/2009/06/my-meeting-with-maulana-saeed-ahmed.html\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n\nMl. A Khan,\nChecked and Approved by:\n\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā\n\n[1] - عن ابن مسعود رضي الله عنه انظروا من تجالسون وعمن تأخذون دينكم فإن الشياطين يتصورون في آخر الزمان في صور الرجال فيقولون : حدثنا وأخبرنا وإذا جلستم إلى رجل فاسألوه عن اسمه وأبيه وعشيرته فتفقدونه إذا غاب. )كنزالعمال باب آفات العلم)\n\n \n\n 2 - قال امام مسلم رحمه الله حَدَّثَنِي مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ قُهْزَاذَ مِنْ أَهْلِ مَرْوَ قَالَ سَمِعْتُ عَبْدَانَ بْنَ عُثْمَانَ يَقُولُ سَمِعْتُ عَبْدَ اللَّهِ بْنَ الْمُبَارَكِ يَقُول الْإِسْنَادُ مِنْ الدِّينِ وَلَوْلَا الْإِسْنَادُ لَقَالَ مَنْ شَاءَ مَا شَاءَ\n\n(   مقدمه مسلم شريف, باب الاسناد من الدين  )\n\n \n\n3- قال امام مسلم رحمه الله حَدَّثَنَا حَسَنُ بْنُ الرَّبِيعِ حَدَّثَنَا حَمَّادُ بْنُ زَيْدٍ عَنْ أَيُّوبَ وَهِشَامٍ عَنْ مُحَمَّدٍ وَحَدَّثَنَا فُضَيْلٌ عَنْ هِشَامٍ قَالَ وَحَدَّثَنَا مَخْلَدُ بْنُ حُسَيْنٍ عَنْ هِشَامٍ عَنْ مُحَمَّدِ بْنِ سِيرِينَ قَالَ إِنَّ هَذَا الْعِلْمَ دِينٌ فَانْظُرُوا عَمَّنْ تَأْخُذُونَ دِينَكُمْ\n\n(   مقدمه مسلم شريف, باب الاسناد من الدين  )"
