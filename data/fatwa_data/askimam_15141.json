  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDear Mufti Sahab, I've a baby girl of eight months Al-Hamdulillah. Now, my wife is again pregnant (first month of pregnancy).  I want to ask a question here; is there any permissibility to abort this pregnancy due to any of the following reasons?\n\n1- The existing baby girl  is still smaller & needs full attention.\n2- We are living in USA alone & we don't have any relatives here to assist us especailly the mother.\n3- My wife is of age 22 & I'm afraid that she could handle two samller babies at the same time.\n\nWhat is your suggestion according to Shari'ah? We are still confused & both of us like to stick with the Shari'ah rules. Al-Hamdulillah we don't have any financial problem except those I discussed earlier. Please suggest us what should we do in this situation.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh.\n\nIt is not permissible to abort the pregnancy based on any one or all the three reasons cited in your query.\n\nInshallah, Allah will grant you all the strength and courage to nurture both the children.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
