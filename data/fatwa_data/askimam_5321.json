  "question": "Please provide the history behind the book, Manzil, as to how it came into existence and the criteria used to select the Qurâ€™aanic verses therein.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nINTRODUCTION%0D%0A%0D%0A'All praise be to Allah and peace and blessings be upon His messenger'.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe aayaat (verses) of the Qur'aan compiled hereunder are generally known as%0D%0A'Manzil\" in our family. The elders in our family were particularly punctual%0D%0Ain reciting this 'Manzil' from amongst other duaas and formulas for%0D%0Aprotection and cure. It was customary to make special arrangements for the%0D%0Achildren of the family to commit this 'Manzil' to memory.%0D%0A%0D%0AUndoubtedly the aayaat of the Our'aan and those duaas that are mentioned in%0D%0Athe Ahaadith are more effective and beneficial than the wearing of a%0D%0ATa'weez. In the formula of these amaliyaat (reciting of certain ayaat and%0D%0Aduaas for a particular purpose) preference must be given to the Qur'aan and%0D%0AAhaadith. The Noble Leader of the Ambiya A.S., Muhammad S.A.W., has taught%0D%0Aus a duaa for every occasion of our Deeni (religious) and Dunyawi (worldly)%0D%0Aneeds. In the experience of the Mashaa'ikh the reciting of certain aayaat%0D%0Aand duaas for particular purposes has also been proven to be successful.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe reading of the 'Manzil' has been confirmed to be extremely effective for%0D%0Aprotection against the evil influence of Jinn, Sihr (witchcraft, sorcery,%0D%0Aetc.), and other evils. These aayaat of the Qur'aan have also been mentioned%0D%0Awith a slight variation in the number of aayaat, in the books 'Al Qowlul%0D%0AJameel' and the 'Beheshti Zewir. Shah Waliullah Muhaddith Deh'lawi R.A.,%0D%0Awrites in his book \"Al Qowlul Jameel\" that there are these thirty three%0D%0Aaayaat which ward off the effects of Sihr (witchcraft), and that they are a%0D%0Aprotection against the Shayaateen (devils), thieves and harmful wild beasts.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn 'Beheshti Zewir' Hadhrat Moulana Asharf Ali Thanwi R.A., writes that if%0D%0Aone suspects anyone to be afflicted by the evil effects of the Jinn then%0D%0Athese aayaat should be written and made up as a Ta'weez, then hung on the%0D%0Avictims neck, so that the Ta'weez be inplace of a pendant, near the heart.%0D%0AThese aayaat should be read and infused into the water by blowing thereon,%0D%0Aand subsequently sprinkled onto the victim. If the ill effect is in a house%0D%0Athen this water may be sprinkled inside and outside the four corners of the%0D%0Ahouse.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhenever womenfolk of our household suggested the reading of these aayaat to%0D%0Aa victim, they had to either indicate these verses in the respective books%0D%0Aor write them down. Therefore it was felt that it would simplify this task%0D%0Aif these aayaat were printed separately. It should be considered, and borne%0D%0Ain mind that the effectiveness of the recital of these aayaat and duaas as a%0D%0Aformula for specific purposes depends on the sincerity, undisturbed and%0D%0Aearnest devotion of the reader. The effectiveness of the response to duaas%0D%0Ais relative to the determination of ones conviction and the depth of ones%0D%0Asincerity with which duaas are made. Allahs names and His true and holy word%0D%0Ahold great Barakaat, (unseen blessings, benefits and advantages of abundant%0D%0Avalue from Allah).%0D%0A%0D%0A'And Allah is the One who grants strength to comply and adhere, (to His will%0D%0Aand command)'.%0D%0A%0D%0AMuhammad Tal'ha Kandahlavi.%0D%0A23 Shabaan, 1399, Hijri%0D%0A%0D%0ATranslated; Rabi 11, 1401 March, 1981"
