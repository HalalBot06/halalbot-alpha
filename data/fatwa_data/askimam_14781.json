And if i may ask which Imaam you follow.\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is not a sin. However, it is advisable not to engage in intercourse during Azaan as a mark of respect and in order to prepare for salaah.\nIf one wishes to increase his Imaan, he should have the greatest amount of respect for Allah, Rasulullah ((Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and Shariah. Ponder upon the greatness of Allah through His creations. That will make one realise Allah’s power and greatness. Study the life of Rasulullah ((Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) in detail. That will make one realise and understand the perfect and sublime character of Rasulullah ((Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam). Study Deen and Shariah. You will understand the perfection of Deen and Islam. One should also make Dua to Allah to increase ones Imaan. Educating oneself about Allah, Deen and His Rasul is the most effective in increasing ones Imaan.\nThe Quraan declares that Qiyaamat is near. Imam Mahdi will appear before Qiyaamat. During his time there will be peace and justice. Everyday Qiyaamat is drawing closer. Our concentration should be on our personal Qiyaamat-death. The life is getting short and the time for death is drawing closer. We should concentrate on what concerns us. What will happen when I die? What will happen in the Qabr (grave)? Did I do good actions and deeds? Will I be able to answer the questions of Imaan in the grave? How will I be resurrected on the day of Qiyaamat? How will I stand before Allah? What will I answer Allah? Will I go to Jannah or not? Am I ready for all that? I should change now and fear Allah. I will return to Him?\nWe are Hanafi and we issue rulings on the Hanafi Madhab.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
