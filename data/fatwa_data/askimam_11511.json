  "question": "Should I confess to wife of sin before we have any children?...I committed a sin with a woman for which I have repented to Allah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI committed a sin with a woman for which I have repented to Allah. However, I am married and fear that my wife may find out in the future about this sin and seek a divorce from me (chance is 10%). Because of this should I confess to her of the sin? Should I consider divorcing her without telling her of the sin? We were planning to have many children and I am worried that if she finds out later and we end up divorcing then, the children would be affected by the divorce. Would a divorce be better now while we do not have any children? Would the ruling be different if she were pregnant and expecting our first child? May Allah(swt) reward you greatly. Wasalam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is no need for you to confess to your wife a sin you committed before marriage. There is also no need for you to divorce your wife.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
