Please note that I use to wear scarf and cover my body during office timing and also avoid to talk to opposite sex\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYou are also a mother. You have a child of two years. When you are at work, your mother has to take care of your child. With respect, that is not the same as you taking care of your child. When you return home from work, you are tired and you will not be able to give your child the much needed attention.\n\nAs the child grows, it demands more attention. The absence of that could impact negatively on the child for a long time or may be permanently. Is the proper upbringing of the child more important or owning a house more important? You will have to sacrifice one for the other. In your instance, sacrifice your extra income and pay attention to your child. Ownership of a house is a possibility and expectation, whereas the loss of motherly attention in your child is a reality. Don’t sacrifice a reality for an expectation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
