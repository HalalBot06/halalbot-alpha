  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni wana know that after a night fall i have changed my clothes and washed my private part and legs with water now am i \"paak\" and can i offer prayer now or not?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nWe are not clear as to what you mean by nightfall. It appears that you are an adult and by nightfall, you mean having a wet dream. If our understanding is correct then our ruling will apply to you.\n\nIf a person had a wet dream, then he has to make ghusal to becomes paak. The clothes that have been soiled by the sperms also become impure. All the clothes do not become impure.\n\nTherefore, merely changing the clothes and washing the private parts and legs will not suffice.\n\nGhusal is to take a full body bath and to rinse the mouth and nose. Ensure the entire body in wet and not portion is left dry.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
