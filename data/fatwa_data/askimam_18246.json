  "question": "Is the brother correct in leading the prayer if he fulfills the first two conditions mentioned above?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWith Reference to Fatwa #18199, What stance should be adopted if the person in Question is\n\n1. The most knowledgable with regards to all aspects and Masaail of Salah (as well as Islam as a whole), and\n\n2.the person also recites the Qur'an the best?\n\nSince he fulfills these two conditions, should he be allowed to lead the salah, or should we stop him. Normally he steps forward on his own accord. Most of the musallees agree with his belief, and tend to back him up.\n\nThe last time he stepped forward, an elderly musallee, reprimanded him. After the salah, the elderly musallee told the young brother that he must not lead the salah without covering his head (with a topi). The elderly Musallee also said to the young brother 'Look at your condition; How can you make namaaz in your condition' (The elderly Musallee was refering to his dressing). The younger brother responded that his beliefs are different and that his imaan and condition is between himself and Allah and it is not for anyone else to judge.\n\n1) Is the brother correct in leading the prayer if he fulfills the first two conditions mentioned above? (with his head uncovered and sometimes with pants below his ankles)\n\n2)How should I as a musallee, address this situation, as things were heating up?\n\nJazakallah for your timeous response to my first question.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n1) The procedure mentioned before is a guide to select the most suitable Imam. However, the post of Imamat is a very high and prestigious position which is to be handed over to someone respectable who follows and adheres to the beautiful teachings of Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم).\n\nRasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) has mentioned:\n\nعن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال ما أسفل من الكعبين من الإزار ففي النار\n\n(صحيح البخاري ج 2 / ص 861,قديمي)\n\n“That part of the pants which is below the ankle will be in the fire” \n\nوإياك وإسبال الإزار فإنها من المخيلة وإن الله لا يحب المخيلة\nسنن أبى داود ج 2 / ص 208,سعيد))\n\n“Beware of allowing the pants to flow below the ankles because verily it is an act of pride and Allah Ta’ala does not love the proud ones”.\n\nعن أبي ذر عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال ثلاثة لا يكلمهم الله يوم القيامة ولا ينظر إليهم ولا يزكيهم ولهم عذاب أليم قال فقرأها رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ثلاث مرارا قال أبو ذر خابوا وخسروا من هم يا رسول الله قال المسبل والمنان والمنفق سلعته بالحلف الكاذب\n صحيح مسلم – ج 1 / ص 71,قديمي ))\n\n“On the day of Qiyamah there will be three types of people, Allah Ta’ala will not speak to them, look at them (i.e. with mercy), nor will he purify them and they will face a painful torment, 1) That male who allows his upper garment to flow below his ankles 2) he who continuously reminds others of the favours he had done 3) He who sells his goods by taking a false oath”.\n\n \n\nAllamah ibn Qayyim Al-Jauziyah, Allamah Suyuti,Ibnul Haj,Mirak,Allamah Barizi and Shaikh Muhib At-Tabari رحمهم الله have all written:\nNabi (صلى الله عليه وسلم) would normally wear a turban with a topi (head cover) underneath. He would sometimes wear only a topi and at times only a turban.\n\n(زاد المعاد ج1 ص135)\n\nAllamah Tibi رحمه الله mentioned that the wearing of the topi alone (i.e. without a turban) is (also) Sunnah, as is the practise of many.\n\n(الكاشف عن حقائق السنن ج8 ص215)\n\nIf there is any other person worthy of making the Imamat who dresses and practises according to the Sunnah, he should be appointed as the Imam. However, in the absence of any other person worthy of Imamat, if he goes forward and leads the congregation, the Salaah of the Musalli’s are valid.\n\n \n\n2)  Whenever an issue arises, irrespective of how serious it maybe, the issue will only be resolved if it is handled in a respectable, dignified and diplomatic manner, otherwise it will just add more fuel to the fire. In order to keep the peace amongst the musalli’s in the Jamaat Khana, if in the future he makes Imamat in the absence of any other person worthy of Imamat, you should follow him in Salaah. However, if there is someone else worthy of Imamat and follows the Sunnah teachings, he should be given preference and granted the post of making the Imamat.\n\nTake out some time or contact some Aalim to talk to this brother in a very polite and diplomatic manner, of the importance of following the Sunnah and keeping the upper garment above the ankles. Insha Allah this will have a positive impact and win over his heart.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
