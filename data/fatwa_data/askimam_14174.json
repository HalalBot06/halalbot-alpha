If your second wife is prepared to forego her rights and live with you, that is in order.\n\n2. In principle, if a Muslim is being restricted from practicing on Islam as was the situation with Rasulullah and the Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhu], then Hijrah will be compulsory. Today, freedom of religion forms part of democracy. Muslims are not restricted from practising and adhering to Islam. The Hijrah that is important in this time and age is the Hijrah of sins. There are all forms of sins and attractions around the world, Muslims should make Hijrah and abstain from sins.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
