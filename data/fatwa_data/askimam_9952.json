The valuation of the house property is US $ 1000000.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nhe Islamic law of Succession and Inheritance will only take effect after your Dad passes away. Till then, he is considered as the owner of the house. If he wishes to distribute the house in his lifetime, he may do so. There are no specified shares for that.\n\nIf he wishes to use the shares of inheritance as a guideline, he may do so.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
