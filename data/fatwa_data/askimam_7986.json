  "question": "what is your opinion on isaal e sawaab(sending sawaab to the dead)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI had earlier heard from a friend of mine that once a sahabi approached our prophet and asked him what can he do for his dead parent. Our prophet replied that dig a well and after the well was dug he said this well is now for your father(my friend said he read this on your website). Now i wanted to know that in india there is a common practice that after a person dies the family members of the dead and other relatives will recite the holy quran and then ask Allah to send the reward for this activity to the dead, so is this correct or wrong. I think that if the above the above incident is correct then this way of sending rewards should also be correct but i really keep wondering that if one is dead thats the end of him, we are always told to be prepared for we never know when we may die, so if this sending rewards this way is correct then many people will end up in heaven because of the deeds they never did. To this a friend of mine said that even when a person is dead, money can be paid to maek up for his prayers and missed fasts. However he said Zakath must be paid before he dies..is this correct...kindle give me details on this. Also please give me details on the do's and donts for sending rewards to the dead.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIsaal-e-Sawaab (to perform a virtuous act and grant the reward to any person, alive or deceased) is permissible. %0D%0A%0D%0AOn numerous occasions, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised the Sahaaba (Radhiyallaahu Anhum) to give charity on behalf of the deceased. One specific incident is of Hadhrat Abu Talha (Radhiallaahy Anhu) when the Aayat, ?You cannot attain virtue until your spend what is beloved to you?? (Nisaa 4). Abu Talha gave his most valuable well and garden, Bi?r Haa as charity on behalf of his deceased mother. In fact, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) slaughtered 100 sheep during his farewell Hajj and made intention for himself and all those (alive, deceased and to come) who bring faith on his prophethood. (Nasbur Raaya, Allama Zailee)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Anas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Whosoever reads Yaseen at anybody?s grave, Allah will decrease their punishment.? This proves that reading the Qur?aan and conveying the rewards to the deceased, benefits the deceased.
