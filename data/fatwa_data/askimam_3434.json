  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. How quran and sunnah explain dreams? Are dreams from shaytan or they are true for the future happenings. 2. How the result of istikhara is experienced. To what extent or how istikhara is related to the dreams. wassalam and Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFirstly, it has to be understood that none of the narrations in the Ahaadith\nhave any mention regarding seeing a dream in Istikhaara, or even about\nperforming the Istikhaara before sleeping. However, some Ulama do prefer\nthat Istikhaara be performed before sleeping.\n\nWith regards to the person who does see a dream while performing Istikhaara,\nit is like any other dream.\n\nIt is reported in a Hadith that dreams are of three types: a)\nHadeeth-un-Nafs - imagination, b) Takweefu-us-Shaytaan - a dream instilled\nin the mind by Shaytaan, c) Bushra minallaah - true dreams are also known as\nMubaashiraat. (Bukhari)\n\nIt is mentioned in a Hadith that the dreams of pious believers are generally\ntrue dreams. Another Hadith states, 'The most true dreams are those seen at\nthe time of Sahr (early dawn).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
