Do not associate with the girl until you marry her.\n\nTo perform a secret Nikah may be against the interest of both of you, especially, the girl as she too will be going against her family, which generally has negative consequences. Nevertheless, if you decide to secretly marry, the Nikah will be valid if it is performed correctly. In such a situation, the second Nikah will be insignificant according to Shari?ah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
