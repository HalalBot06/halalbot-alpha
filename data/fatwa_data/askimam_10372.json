  "answer": "QUESTION\nCould you tell me all the types of liquids (e.g.sperm, mazi etc) that come out of the male private parts, and also tell me how you know if it is sperm or mazi or whatever, and could you also tell me what you do in such situations e.g. do you have a bath?, wudhu? A friend of mine goes to university and lives away from home, he has recently consumed alcohol, drugs and defends himself by saying that ?its only 1% alcohol in the drink? etc. me and my friend are doing fikr for him, how should I explain to him the harms of alcohol and the harms of the life he is leading?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour concern for your friend is encouraging. That is a sign of your strength%0D%0Aand sensitivity to Deen. May Allah Ta'ala accept your concern and efforts,%0D%0AAameen.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf every Muslim expresses a similar concern to his friends and associates,%0D%0Athat will have a huge positive impact on the reformation of the Ummah. You%0D%0Ahave identified a shortcoming in your friend. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi%0D%0Awasallam] said, 'A believer is a mirror to a believer.' First and foremost,%0D%0Ayou should keep your friend as close as possible to you like a mirror. That%0D%0Awill enable you to observe his temperaments more closely in order to%0D%0Aapproach him appropriately. Your close relationship with him, your kindness%0D%0Aand compassion to him will win his confidence in you. He will present his%0D%0Aheart and himself to you. Your advise to him will be appreciated and valued.%0D%0AYour friend will try his level best to implement the advises given to him as%0D%0Athat will be motivated by your love and compassion for him. Once you gain%0D%0Athe confidence of your friend and he hands himself over to you, he requests%0D%0Afor advise or he is ready to accept your advise, discuss with him the%0D%0Afollowing:%0D%0A1. The purpose of life and life after death. Discuss about accountability in%0D%0Athe court of Allah. The discussion of Jannah and Jahannum will be useful.%0D%0AThe greatest motivation behind the change and reformation in a person is the%0D%0Aconsciousness of Allah and accountability in the court of Allah.%0D%0A2. Explain the verse, 'O you who believe, verily wine, gambling, worshipping%0D%0Aidols and choosing spears (in making decisions) are dirt and acts of the%0D%0AShaytaan, so abstain. Verily, Shaytaan want to instil among you enmity and%0D%0Aanimosity through those evils.'%0D%0A3. Physical harms of consuming alcohol and the value of life.%0D%0A4. Sahaabas abstention from alcohol expression of submission to the order of%0D%0AAllah after it was prohibited.%0D%0A5. Assist your friend in leaving the habit if he is addicted to it.%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, 'If one person is guided%0D%0Athrough you, that is better than red camels (the most precious commodity of%0D%0Athat time).'%0D%0A%0D%0AThere are two types of liquids that emit from the private parts.%0D%0A1. Mazi - thick liquid which emits after erection and before ejaculation.%0D%0AMazi is impure (Najis). If it soils any portion of the clothes, it must be%0D%0Awashed before performing Salaat. Mazi invalidate Wudhu only. There is no%0D%0Aneed to take a bath upon and after the emission of Mazi.%0D%0A2. Mani - a thick fluid which comes out with force and satisfies one's%0D%0Apassion. The emission of Mani causes diserection. Mani is also impure like%0D%0AMazi. Mani invalidates Ghusl.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
