What other signs are there to indicate that Qiyamat is near?Jazakallah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYA'JOOJ AND MA'JOOJ%0D%0ADuring the reign of Eesa (%C1layhis salaam) people will live an extremely%0D%0Apeaceful life filled with prosperity and abundance. Then the wall which%0D%0Aimprisones Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj will break and they will surge forth in large%0D%0Anumbers.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"But when Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj are let loose and they rush headlong down%0D%0Aevery hill\"%0D%0A%0D%0AWHO ARE'THE YA'JOOJ AND MA'JOOJ%0D%0AZul Qarnain (A.S.) who was a pious and just Ruler travelled to many lands%0D%0Aand conquered them, establishing justice and the Law of Allah therein. Allah%0D%0ATa'ala provided him with all forms of material strength through which he was%0D%0Aable to carry out his conquests and missions.%0D%0A%0D%0AHe once carried out a mission in three directions, the far west, the far%0D%0Aeast, and then in a northerly direction. It was here that he came across a%0D%0Atribe of people who complained to him about the tribes of Ya'iooj and%0D%0AMa'jooj which inhabited the land behind two huge mountains and often emerged%0D%0Afrom behind these mountains to perpetrate acts of anarchy and plunder among%0D%0Athem. They requested Zul Qarnain (A.S.) to erect a barrier between%0D%0Athemselves and the tribes of Ya'jooi and Majooj so that they could be saved%0D%0Afrom their atrocities. With the material strength at his disposal, Zul%0D%0AQarnain (A.S.) enlisted their physical labour and set about erecting a high%0D%0Awall between the two mountains. The height of the wall or its exact length%0D%0Ais unknown. What is known is that the height of this wall reaches that of%0D%0Athe summit of both mountains. It is made with blocks or sheets of iron,%0D%0Awhich is further strengthened with molten lead. In this manner Ya'jooj and%0D%0AMa'jooj are unable to scale the wall, or cross it except when it is the will%0D%0Aof Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"And when the promise of my Rabb approaches, He will level it to dust\"%0D%0A(Quran 18:98)%0D%0A%0D%0AThey are situated in a land of ice which is hidden from our gazes and the%0D%0Aexact location of which is unknown. Though many interpretations do exist in%0D%0Athis respect, none of these can be said to be absolute.%0D%0A%0D%0AYa'jooj and Ma'jooj are human beings and according to a narration they are%0D%0Afrom the progeny of Yafith ibn Nooh (A.S.)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn a lengthy hadith by Hadhrat Nawwas ibn Sam'aan (R.A.) Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) is reported to have said: \"Allah will send%0D%0Arevelation upon Eesa (A.S.) that 'Such a creation of mine is now going to%0D%0Aemerge that no power will be able to stop them. Therefore take my servants%0D%0Aand ascend the Mount of Toor'. Then Ya'jooi and Ma'jooj will emerge and%0D%0Asurge fourth in all their fury. When those from among them who constitute%0D%0Athe fromer part of their army pass the lake of Tiberias (which is in%0D%0ANorthern Palestine), they will drink up all the water of that lake and by%0D%0Athe time those that constitute the latter part of that same army pass the%0D%0Alake, they will say, \"There used to be water here (long ago). When they will%0D%0Areach the Mount of Khamr in Jerusalem, they will arrogantly proclaim; \"We%0D%0Ahave conquered the people of the earth, now we will annihilate those in the%0D%0Asky\".%0D%0A%0D%0ASo saying they will fire their arrows towards the sky. When the arrows%0D%0Areturn to the ground they will be blood stained.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the meantime Eesa (A.S.) will be on the Mount of Toor with his followers.%0D%0AAt that time the head of an ox will as valuable as is hundred dinars to you%0D%0Ain this day. (This indicates the scarcity of provisions).%0D%0A%0D%0AFaced with these hardships, Eesa (A.S.) and his followers will make dua unto%0D%0AAllah (to remove this calamity). As a result Allah will cause sores to%0D%0Aappear on the necks of each and every individual of these people which will%0D%0Acause their death suddenly. When Eesa (A.S.) and his followers descend from%0D%0Athe Mount of Toor there will not be a single space on the land where the%0D%0Adead rotting bodies of these people is not littered, giving off a horrendous%0D%0Aodour. Eesa (A.S.) and his followers will once more supplicate unto Allah as%0D%0Aa result of which Allah will send down huge birds whose necks will be as%0D%0Athick as that of the necks of camels, and they will dump these bodies in a%0D%0Aplace where Allah wills. (According to a narration by Tirmidhi, they will be%0D%0Adumped at a place called Nahbal).%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala will then send down a heavy rain, the waters of which will flow%0D%0Ain every part of the earth cleansing it thoroughly. It will rain for a%0D%0Aperiod of forty days. The Muslims will then burn the bows and arrows of%0D%0AYa'jooi and Ma'jooj for a period of seven years. Allah will order the earth%0D%0Ato yield forth its crops in abundance and there will be such blessing and%0D%0Aprosperity that one pomegranate will be sufficient for a whole group while%0D%0Athe peel thereof will suffice to cast a shadow over them. The milk of one%0D%0Acamel will be sufficient for many groups while one milk giving cow will be%0D%0Asufficient for a whole tribe. One milk giving goat will be sufficient for a%0D%0Awhole family...\" (Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Saeed Khudri (R.A.) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) said: \"On the day of Qiyamah Allah will say to Adam (A.S.) to pick%0D%0Aout the Jahannamis from his entire progeny. Adam (A.S.) will ask: \"O Rabb%0D%0Awho are they\"? Allah will say: \"Nine hundred and ninety nine of a thousand%0D%0Aare Jahannami while the one is a Jannati'. On hearing this the Sahaba were%0D%0Aovertaken by fear and they asked: \"O Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Awho will that one Jannati be\"? Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) said:%0D%0A\"Do not grieve, the nine hundred and ninety nine will be Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj%0D%0Awhile you will be the Jannati\". (i.e. your numbers in relation to them will%0D%0Abe one in a thousand). (Bukhari and Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abdullah ibn Umar (R.A.) says that Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) said: \"Allah Ta'ala divided mankind into ten parts. Nine tenths%0D%0Aconstitute Ya'jooi and Ma'jooj while the remaining one tenth constitutes the%0D%0Arest of mankind\". Hadhrat Zainab bint Jahsh (R.A.) says: \"...once Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) awoke from such a sleep that his face was red%0D%0Aand these words were on his tongue,' There is none worthy of worship but%0D%0AAllah. Destruction is upon the Arabs on account of that evil which has come%0D%0Aclose to them. Today a hole as big as this has opened up in the wall of%0D%0AYa'jooj and Ma'jooj and Rasulullah (SaliaJiahu Alayhi Wasallam) indicated%0D%0Athe size of the hole forming a ring with his index finger and thumb\".%0D%0A(Bukhari and Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Hurairah (R.A.) narrates that every day Ya'jooi and Ma'jooi%0D%0Abreak (dig) through the wall erected by Zul Qarnain (A.S.) until they reach%0D%0Athe end of it to that extent that they can actually see the light on the%0D%0Aother side. They then return (home) saying that \"We will break through%0D%0Atomorrow. \"But Allah Ta'ala causes the wall to revert to its original%0D%0Athickness and the next day they start digging through the wall all over%0D%0Aagain, and this process continues each day until as long as Allah wills them%0D%0Ato remain imprisoned. When Allah wishes them to be released, then at the end%0D%0Aof the day they will say, 'If Allah wills, tomorrow we will break through\".%0D%0AThe following day they will find the wall as they had left it the previous%0D%0Aday (i.e. a will not have returned to its original state). and after%0D%0Abreaking the remaining part of it they will emerge\". (Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn%0D%0AMajah)%0D%0A%0D%0ACommenting on the above hadith, Allamah ibn Arabi says, Three miracles are%0D%0Aevident in this hadith:%0D%0A1. It never occurs to these tribes that they must continue work during the%0D%0Anight. After all, they are in such large numbers that they can easily%0D%0Adelegate the work among themselves and work in shifts. But Allah does not%0D%0Aallow this thought to occur to them.%0D%0A2. It does never occur to them that they can merely cross the mountains or%0D%0Ascale the wall, which they can do through the aid of equipment and%0D%0Aimplements which they possess in large numbers. According to a narration by%0D%0AWahab ibn Munabbah it is known that these tribes are agriculturists and%0D%0Aartisians possessing various types of equipment.%0D%0A3. The thought of saying \"if Allah wills\" never enters their minds and it%0D%0Awill only occur to them to say it when Allah wills that they be released.%0D%0A%0D%0ASigns of Qiyamah by Tayyib Publications%0D%0A%0D%0AYA'JOOJ AND MA'JOOJ%0D%0AYajooj and Majooj are two tribes which have been imprisoned behind a%0D%0Amountain range by Zul Qarnain (alayhis salaam). They are a powerful and wild%0D%0Apeople. They will emerge from their imprisonment during the reign of Nabi%0D%0AIsaa (alayhis salaam), i.e. after the death of Imaam Mahdi (alayhis salaam).%0D%0A%0D%0AAfter their emergence, they will wrought great destruction and anarchy on%0D%0Aearth. They are imprisoned in a land of ice, the location of which is hidden%0D%0Afrom our gaze. Allah Ta'ala will finally eliminate them by means of a%0D%0Anatural disaster. After the destruction of Yajooj and Ma'jooj. Nabi Isaa%0D%0A(alayhis salaam) will live for a period of forty years.%0D%0A%0D%0AImportant: Some commentaries on the Qur'aan written by modernists present%0D%0Asome fanciful interpretations regarding the people, Yajooj and Ma'jooj.%0D%0ATheir interpretations being the product of their personal opinions refute%0D%0Athe Shar'i teachings on Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj. All such personal opinions and%0D%0Atheories advanced by the modernists are baatil-baseless and false. Among%0D%0Asuch false personal opinions on the matter of Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj is the%0D%0Acommentary of Yusuf Ali.%0D%0A%0D%0AKitaabul Imaan by Majlisul Ulama%0D%0A"
