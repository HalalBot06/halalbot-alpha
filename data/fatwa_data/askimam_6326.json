  "answer": "QUESTION\nI keep reading how our dear Prophet SAW, his sahabas, and family members and many pious muslims used to stay awake in ibadat whole night. And at the same time they did their household chores or other work that they used to do, didn't have much to eat, were fasting a lot. I am trying to make up my lost fasts from the time of my childhood, praying five times (with hours reading duas, Allah's names, some surahs etc) trying to read ishraq namaz, tahajjud and even awwabeen. I work full time 5 days a week. My travelling time to work is 1 hour one way. What I am trying to say is that I get so tired, not of praying but physically tired. Sometimes I do miss a prayer because I overslept for fajr, or was too tired to know what I am saying to pray isha. I don't like missing my prayers but can't help wondering why I get so tired and how come the people mentioned above didn't get tired? I want to pray, so I don't think it is because my imaan is not so strong. Today I missed my fajr prayer even though I had the alarm on. I did read that if a person overslept than its not a sin but that's not the point. I just hate missing my prayer. I also read in fazail-e amaal about how simple they were living their lives, which makes me want to throw up at my lifestyle. In comparison to their live, my life seems like a royal life. So, I was wondering should I then sleep on floor instead of bed?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo seek an income to fulfil one's basic needs and support one's dependants\nis compulsory. It is also an act of worship and great reward. Simply change\nyour intention and that will create a feeling of fulfillment in your\nsacrifice of traveling for work. It will also decrease your burden, if any.\nTo get tired is natural.\n\nYou should make every possible effort to perform every Fardh Salaat\ntimeously. If you overslept and there was no negligence on your part in\nwaking up for Salaat, you will be excused. It is also natural to feel upset\nat missing Salaat. It is the Sunnah of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) to sleep on the floor. It is pemissible to sleep on the bed and\nuse other luxuries of life with Shari'ah. If you have the courage and\nstrength to follow that Sunnah, then you should adopt that Sunnah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
