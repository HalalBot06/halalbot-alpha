  "question": "Can an Aalim who did many people down in his business which was in the newspapers,can he go in front of a jumma congregation and lead the prayer is he not a Faasiq?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaams.Please comment 1) This Aalim cheated many people in his business as well as the reciver of revenue,it was also in the newspapers.He then wants to lead the Jumma prayer ,is he not a Faasiq? 2) We have a problem in our masjid,during Ramadaan the Mutawallis only allow the Hufaaz who are from rich families to make taraweeh.I witnessed a situation where a boy who reads beautifully came and asked to read Taraweeh in our Mosque and the Muttawallis said that his father is a nobody and he cant read in our Mosque..where is the justice? 3) We hear every year how the Haj agents are corrupt and dont deliver what they promise here at home ,they dont refund the people when the flights go late etc.should we as muslims do what we can to stop these agents by reporting them to neccessary authorities? They abuse the Hujaaj?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In principle, if a Muslim, Aalim or non-Aalim commits a major sin and does not repent, he is a Fasiq. It is Makrooh for a Faasiq to perform Salaat. However, if he made sincere Tawbah, then his Fisq falls off and his Imaamat will not be Makrooh. If a person openly commits sins and his sins are well known to the community, then it is not proper to appoint such a person as an Imaam as the congregation should have respect for the Imaam. The position of Imaamat will be taken lightly by the general public.\n\n2. It is incorrect to determine an Imaam for Taraweeh based on the father being somebody. It is sad that a Hafiz was rejected to be an Imaam for Taraweeh as his father is ?nobody?. Richness of wealth is no criteria in Shari?ah for choosing an Imaam.\n\n3. If Hujjaaj are abused, then they have recourse to SAHUC (South African Hajj and Umrah Council) ? a recognised body to address all difficulties during Hajj and Umrah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
