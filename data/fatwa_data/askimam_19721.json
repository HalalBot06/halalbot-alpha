  "answer": "QUESTION\nsalam, im looking to start studying sharia law, preferably in a Muslim country. whats your advice for me?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\n \n\nAs-salāmu `alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\nWe commend you on your good intention to study Shariah Law. Islam accords significant importance to studying Deeni (religious) knowledge.\n\n \n\nRasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said:\n\n \n\n \n\nحَدَّثَنَا هِشَامُ بْنُ عَمَّارٍ قَالَ: حَدَّثَنَا حَفْصُ بْنُ سُلَيْمَانَ قَالَ: حَدَّثَنَا كَثِيرُ بْنُ شِنْظِيرٍ، عَنْ مُحَمَّدِ بْنِ سِيرِينَ، عَنْ أَنَسِ بْنِ مَالِكٍ قَالَ: قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ: «طَلَبُ الْعِلْمِ فَرِيضَةٌ عَلَى كُلِّ مُسْلِمٍ\n\n[سنن ابن ماجه 1/ 81]\n\n \n\n \n\nTranslation: “Seeking Knowledge is an obligation on every Muslim” (Sunan Ibn Majah, 81/1, Mishkaatul - Masaabeeh, Kitaabul – Ilm, 218, 301/1)\n\n \n\n \n\nVirtues of Knowledge\n\n \n\n \n\nAllah (Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala) says:\n\n \n\nيرفع اللَّهُ اللذين امنوا و اللذين اوتوا العلم درجات\n\n \n\nTranslation: “Allah elevates those who believe and those who have been given knowledge in different stages” (Surah Al – Mujaadalah, 11/58)\n\n \n\nThe above mentioned verse expounds the honour given to an Aalim (Islamic Scholar) over a normal believer. An Aalim (Islamic Scholar) has virtue over a non- Aalim.[1]\n\n \n\nRasullullah (Sallaalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said:\n\n \n\nفقيه واحد اشد علي الشيطان من الف عابد\n\n \n\nTranslation: “One person who has understanding of Deen is more severe over Shaytaan than one thousand worshipping slaves” (Mishkaatul – Masaabeeh, 217, 300/1, Kitaabul – Ilm, Daarul – Fikr, Tirmidhi , Ibn Maajah)\n\n \n\nRasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said:\n\n \n\n \n\nمَنْ سَلَكَ طَرِيقًا يَلْتَمِسُ فِيهِ عِلْمًا، سَهَّلَ اللَّهُ لَهُ طَرِيقًا إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ\n\n[سنن ابن ماجه 1/ 81]\n\n \n\nTranslation: “That person who treads the path of knowledge, Allah will make his pathway to Jannah (Paradise) easy” (Sunan Ibn Majah, 81/1)\n\n \n\nفَضْلَ الْعَالِمِ عَلَى الْعَابِدِ كَفَضْلِ الْقَمَرِ عَلَى سَائِرِ الْكَوَاكِبِ\n\n[سنن ابن ماجه 1/ 81]\n\n \n\nTranslation:  “The virtue of the Aalim over the worshipping bondsmen is like the virtue of the Moon over all the Stars” (Sunan Ibn Maajah, 81/1)\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen searching for something, the purpose (Maqsood) is highlighted, for example, if a person is ill, his purpose is to get treatment and be cured. For that he will search for a competent and reliable physician.\n\n \n\nAllah (Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala) says:\n\n \n\nانما يخشي اللَّه من عباده العلماء\n\n \n\nTranslation: “Only the Ulema fear Allah from his servants” (Surah Al- Faatir, 35/28)\n\n \n\nThe objective of studying Ilme- Deen is to gain the pleasure and fear of Allah (Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala) which is the apex of knowledge.\n\n \n\nYou should search and see where this is best achieved.\n\n \n\nMuhammad Ibn Seereen (Rahmatullahi Alayhi), a great jurist states: “Indeed this knowledge is your religion, investigate/enquire about those whom you take your religion”[2]\n\n \n\nIf your teacher is a pseudo Scholar having no Sunnah and Shariah in his life, don’t expect to achieve the Noor (Spiritual light) of Ilm (Knowledge) in you.\n\n \n\nThe Noor of Ilm goes beyond books and studying.\n\n \n\nIn the past, the Ulema of Haqq (Truth) did not only focus on studying of books, rather, they stayed in the companionship of a pious and learned Scholar who upheld the Sunnah and Shariah.\n\n \n\nHereunder are a few examples of such illustrious Ulema:\n\n \n\n \n\n1. Imam Abu Haneefah (Rahmatullahi Alayhi) studied under the tutorship of his Ustaadh (Teacher), Hammad Bin Abi Sulaymaan (Rahmatullahi Alayhi) until he passed away.Imam Abu Haneefah (Rahmatullahi Alayhi) attained many Sifaat(qualities).These qualities were not gained through studying books, rather, they were acquired from the Ustaadh.\n\n \n\n3. Imam Muslim (Rahmatullahi Alayhi) studied under the tutelage of Imam Bukhari (Rahmatullahi Alayhi).\n\n \n\n4. Imam Muhammed (Rahmatullahi) studied under the tutelage of Imaam Abu Hanefah (Rahmatullahi Alayhi) until he passed away.\n\n \n\n5. Haafiz Ibn Hajar Al - Asqalaani (Rahmatullahi Alayhi), the commentator of the famous Al- Jaami – Ul –Saheeh of Imaam Bukhari (Rahmatullahi Alayhi), studied under the tutelage of Allamah Iraaqi (Rahmatullahi Alayhi).\n\n \n\n6. In the recent past, Hadhrat Sheikhul Hind Moulana Mahmoodul – Hasan Deobandi (Rahmatullahi Alayhi) studied under the tutelage of Hadhrat Moulana Qaasim Nanotwi (Rahmatullahi Alayhi), the founder of Daarul Uloom Deoband, a famous Islamic Seminary in the Indian Subcontinent from which hundreds of thousands of likeminded Islamic Seninaries have spread across the Globe and are attributed to Darul Uloom Deoband.\n\n \n\n7. Sheikhul Islam, Hadhrat Moulana Hussain Ahmed Al – Madani (Rahmatullahi Alayhi) studied under his famed Ustaadh, Hadhrat Sheikhul Hind (Rahmatullahi Alayhi) and stayed in his companionship for the rest of his life.\n\n \n\nThese luminaries attained True Islamic Knowledge by staying in the company of their tutors who were upright, Pious and upheld the Shariah and Sunnah at all times. This companionship effected their students who also attained the same saintly qualities of Taqwa, Fear of Allah (Subhanahu Wa  Ta’ala, upholding the Shariah and Sunnah, good character, tolerance and many other qualities from their tutors.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRasullullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said:\n\n \n\nيحمل هذا العلم من كل خلف عدوله، ينفون عنه تحريف الغالين و انتحال المبطلين و تاويل الجاهلين\n\n \n\nTranslation: “This Knowledge will be transmitted from every just successor who will negate the distortions of the deviated, the plagiarism of the people on falsehood and the false interpretations of the ignoramuses” (Mishkaatul – Masaabeeh, 248.322/1, ibid)\n\n \n\nThe above description mentioned in the Hadeeth expounds to us the key attributes and principles of the Ulema of Haqq (Truth).\n\n \n\nYou stated that your preference is in studying in a Muslim Country. Unfortunately, not everything in a Muslim Country is Islamic.\n\n \n\nWe are not in a position to comment on any Islamic Institution in any Muslim Country. However, we can comment on the Islamic Institutions present in South Africa.\n\n \n\nAlahamdulillah, there is an influx of students from many parts of the World coming to South Africa to study.\n\n \n\nMy respected Father Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Daamat Barakaatuhum) teaches at Daarul Uloom Nu’maaniyyah based in Durban, South Africa.\n\n \n\nYou may refer to the following link for more details should you wish to study Islamic Shariah:\n\nhttp://daruliftaa.net/Trusted-Links/numaniyyah.html\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best.\n\n \n\nIsmail Desai,\n\nDurban, South Africa\n\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\ndaruliftaa.net\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n و رفع الدرجات تدل علي الفضل. فتح الباري لابن حجر.172/1.دار الحديث.[1]\n\n \n\n  وعن ابن سير ين قال : ان هذا العلم دين فانظروا عمن تاخذون دينكم.مسلم.مشكوة المصابيح.273.373/1.[2]"
