Can he do Hajj for someone who is alive but not able to travel?\n\n3. Also people who are in saudi arabia, they do Hajj without any registration and paper work, they just sneak in, is this ok ? , though not allowed by government ? doing Haj is the main thing, or doing it within framework of law ? jazakAllah khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. It is permissible to do Hajj-e-Badal on behalf of a deceased and on behalf of a person who is alive but cannot perform Hajj due to a permanently critical health reason. If Hajj is Fardh upon a person but he is not permanently ill, and there is hope of recovery, then Hajj-e-Badal cannot be performed on his behalf.\n\n2. A person living in Saudi Arabia can perform only the Ifraad Hajj. He cannot do Qiraat or Tamattu.\n\n3. It is not appropriate to violate the Hajj administrative laws. However, adhering to such laws is not a prerequisite for the validity of Hajj.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
