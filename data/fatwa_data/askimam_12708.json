  "question": "I thought Allah rests in his throne sometimes Amongst doing other things such as, helping Muslims in their lives.Is it okay to believe this? Are ambiyaa alive in their graves",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala is completely independent and is free of all faults. He is not dependent on anything. In the Quran Allah Ta'ala says he made Istiwaa on his throne. Our belief is that we believe in what Allah Ta'ala intended by the word Istiwaa, however we don't take it on its literal meaning i.e.. sitting, as this meaning is not suitable for Allah Ta'ala. This is because the person sitting on something becomes dependent on that thing and similarly by saying that Allah Ta'ala is sitting on his throne, it implies that Allah Ta'ala is confined to a place, which is impossible. Allah Ta'ala exists without place and time. Thus we believe that Allah Ta'ala made istiwaa on his Throne and we believe in what Allah Ta'ala intended by the word istiwaa. This is from the Mutashaabihaat i.e.. those things whose real meaning only Allah Ta'ala is aware of.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe belief of the Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama'ah is that the Ambiyaa (Alaihim as-Salaah was-Salaam) are alive in their graves.
