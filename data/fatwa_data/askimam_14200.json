  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have many friends who claim that the meat slaughtered by the ahl-e-kitaab is halaal even though the NAME of ALLAH SWT was not taken at the time of slaughter.  They tell me that one should not reject food that is offered by other Muslims.  I try to explain to me that I can not accept your offer because I consider such meats to be murdaar.  They insist that I am wrong and that I am causing a further split in the ummah.  I told my friend the other day that a certain styrofoam cup brand contains zinc stereate, a fatty acid derived from swine, as a lubricant in the cup making.  He informed me that I am commiting the sin of tashaddud.  He told me that the jews used to do tashaddud and Prophet Musa (PBUH) came to save them.  Hence, I was indirectly told that I am implementing the actions of the jews.  Please kindly comment to these problems with support from the Qur'an-e-hakeem and the ahadith. \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. It is not permissible for a woman to become a president of MSA. This is because her position demands that she interact with strange men [non-Mahram] which is haraam and prohibited. From among the signs of Qiyaamat is that woman will take up leadership positions and become rulers. Furthermore, the MSA meetings are mixed and there is free intermingling. The responsible people should try and correct this practice. It is sad to note that this is a body that represents Muslims and Deen, but the Laws of Allah are not upheld. An Islamic Society should be an organization that portrays true Islam and Deen. These organizations in the university should not be as other student movements that are formed for ulterior motives. The Islamic Society must have dedicated Muslim students that are committed to Deen and are motivated by the fear of Allah. Until such members are not part of the Society, such an organization can never become a means of others gaining Hidaayat and finding the straight path. In order for other students to be convinced about Islam, it is the responsibility of the Islamic Society and its affiliates to project true Islam and be practical. Attending certain programmes and Jumma is not sufficient. Then what is the difference between us Muslims and other religious organizations. They also attend their places of worship once or twice a week. We therefore implore you and your associates to consider this advise and try to change the mindset of the Muslim students first. If there is an Islamic renaissance, this alone will attract other students and you will be used as a means of other students Hidaayat (guidance). Programmes with pop and glory for a few hours do not yield and constructive benefit but only becomes an entertainment for all participants and everyone returns with nothing to ponder over.\n\n2. If the subject is studied for sheer entertainment or is used as an easy alternate to pass the examination, it will not be permissible to study it. Hayaa and modesty are inherent qualities of a believer. Lessons of this nature generally surpass the limits of modesty and breed lewdness and incite passion and desire. However, if the subject is studied for a genuine reason, for example a medical doctor wishing to pursue a degree in this field it would be permissible for him to study this subject as it is not for entertainment and pass time.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
