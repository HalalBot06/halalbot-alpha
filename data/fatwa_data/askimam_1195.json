  "question": "If the husband gives the wife his home (for example) but does nottransfer it on her name to avoid the transfer duty, is it regarded as given according to Shariâ€™ah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe husband may gift his house to his wife during his lifetime by\nrelinquishing all his rights over the house. The wife must also accept the\ngift. Having done so, according to Shariah she will be the owner of the\nhouse even though the house would have been on the husband?s name. In order\nto avoid any problems in the future, the transaction of gifting should be\nreduced to writing and witnessed accordingly. If the husband pre-deceases\nthe wife, the house will be excluded from the husband?s estate.\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best.\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
