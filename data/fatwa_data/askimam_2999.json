  "question": "Is niyyah (intention) permissible in Urdu before prayer?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIT HAS COME TO MY KNOWLEDGE THAT A NEEYAT (AN INTENTION MADE BEFORE PRAYER) IS NOT PERMISSIBLE, IS THIS TRUE OR FALSE. MY PARENTS HAVE TOLD ME I MUST DO A NEEYAT. WHAT SHALL I DO? JAZAKALLAH\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNiyyat (to make Niyyat) is an integral part of all actions. Without Niyyat,\nan action is void of Thawaab. There are certain Ibaadat where Niyyat is a\nprerequisite for its validity, e.g. Salaat.\n\nHowever, Niyyat is an act of the heart. Hence, if a person is certain in his\nheart that he is performing Dhuhr Salaat, for example, and he utters Asr\nSalaat by mistake, his Dhuhr Salaat will still be valid. A verbal intention\nmay be made before commencing Salaat. It could be made in any language,\nkeeping in mind that you do not inconvenience the person standing next to\nyou, e.g. raising the voice when making Niyyat, etc. (Sharhul Wiqaayat\npg.139)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
