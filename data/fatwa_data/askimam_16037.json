  "question": "If someone wants to become a shaheed, what should he do, other than make du'aa?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. If someone wants to become a shaheed, what should he do, other than make du'aa?  This is a world of means, cause, and effect, so what steps and efforts should one make to try and become a shaheed?  should he especially go to places where legitimate jihad battles are taking place, and fight there and hope that he gets killed? or what?\n\n2. how exactly does one create a will, according to shariah?  does he just use any piece of paper? and what does he write on it, in order for it to be a valid will?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh.\n\n1.      If a  person is sincere with Allah in his aim, Allah will guide him. It is also mentioned in a Hadith: Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم ) said “Whoever sincerely begs from Allah to grant him the status of Shahadah (martyrdom), Allah will raise him from among the martyrs even though he passes away on his bed (home)”.\n\n \n\nصحيح مسلم - (ج 12 / ص 461(\n\nحَدَّثَنِى أَبُو الطَّاهِرِ وَحَرْمَلَةُ بْنُ يَحْيَى - وَاللَّفْظُ لِحَرْمَلَةَ - قَالَ أَبُو الطَّاهِرِ أَخْبَرَنَا وَقَالَ حَرْمَلَةُ حَدَّثَنَا عَبْدُ اللَّهِ بْنُ وَهْبٍ حَدَّثَنِى أَبُو شُرَيْحٍ أَنَّ سَهْلَ بْنَ أَبِى أُمَامَةَ بْنِ سَهْلِ بْنِ حُنَيْفٍ حَدَّثَهُ عَنْ أَبِيهِ عَنْ جَدِّهِ أَنَّ النَّبِىَّ -صلى الله عليه وسلم- قَالَ « مَنْ سَأَلَ اللَّهَ الشَّهَادَةَ بِصِدْقٍ بَلَّغَهُ اللَّهُ مَنَازِلَ الشُّهَدَاءِ وَإِنْ مَاتَ عَلَى فِرَاشِهِ ». وَلَمْ يَذْكُرْ أَبُو الطَّاهِرِ فِى حَدِيثِهِ « بِصِدْقٍ ».\n\n \n\n2.      A will to inform the executors of the estate how to manage your money after your demise. A person generally records his assets, debts, etc. in his will. If the person intends to bequeath (Wasiyyat) some of his assets to someone he may do so in the will. It is important to remember that one cannot make a bequest in favour of an heir. The maximum a person may bequeath is one third of the estate after burial expenses and paying off debts. It is also important to note that a will has certain legal implications. Therefore, a will should be designed according to the Shariah Laws of inheritance together with complying with the legal system of your country. After confirming the Shariah aspects of your will, you should give it to a lawyer to approve its legal status.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
