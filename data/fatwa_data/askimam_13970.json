  "question": "Is it allowed to work as a cook when we have to cook pig meat as well?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it allowed to work as a cook when we have to cook pig meat as well?\n\nWill the income from this job be considered Halal?\n\n What should be done if the person cannot find an alternative job?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is not permissible to work as a cook in which it is required to cook Haraam. That is similar to serving wine. Allah Ta’ala states, ‘And do not assist in sin.’ (Maaida)\n\nIf one does not have any income and he has no alternative to support himself and his dependants, then he will be excused from accepting the employment of cooking Haraam. In the meanwhile, the person should continue searching for a Halaal source of income.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
