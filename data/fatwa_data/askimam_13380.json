  "answer": "QUESTION\nThere is a hadith about Najd. Our beloved prophet SAW made doa for Yaman and Syam, but not to Najd.. and so on. Some Ulama' said this hadith referring to Wahhabi sect.\n\nÂ Question:\n1. What is the authenticity of this hadith? From which kitab, its status, etc.\n2. What is the syarah of this hadith by the previous Ulama'?\n3. What is your valuable comments and opinion about this?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nNajd being the place of Fitnah and the rising of the horn of Shaytaan, is recorded by Imaam Bukhari [ra] on the authority of Sayyiduna Abdullah ibn Umar [Radhiallaahu anhuma] that once Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] made du'aa, 'Oh Allah! Bless us in our Syria, Oh Allah! Bless us in our Yemen.' Some Sahaaba [Radhiallaahu anhum] requested that Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] also include Najd in his du'aa, but Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] repeated the same words without mentioning Najd, on the third request, he said, 'That is where the earthquakes and Fitnahs (corruption) will occur, and in it the horns of Shaytaan will rise.' (Sahih Bukhari Hadith7094)\n\nThe Muhadditheen have explained that over centuries, there were several Fitnahs / evils and innovations that had originated from the area of Najd. (Fathul Baari vol.13 pg.58 Hadith7094)\n\nThe Hadith is general and includes all eras. Every Fitnah that originates from the era of Najd will be considered within the ambit of this Hadith.\n\nNB. The reason for which some Ulama implicate the Wahabis/Salafis with this Hadith is because their origin is from Najd.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH SCIENCES\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
