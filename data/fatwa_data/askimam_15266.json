  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDo we as Muslims believe that Dinosaurs existed before mankind?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThere is a possibility that dinosaurs did exist. Islam neither negates this fact nor does it confirm it. However, there is no Shari’ benefit in discussing such issues.\n\nAllah Ta’ala says in the Holy Quran:        \n\nيا أيها الذين آمنوا لا تسألوا عن أشياء إن تبد لكم تسؤكم\n\nO those who believe, do not ask about things which,\n\nif disclosed, may displease you; (Verse 5:101)\n\nUnder the commentary of this verse, Mufti Shafi Saheb (Rahmatullahi Alaih) explains:\n\n“Asking about things for which there is no need, shall still remain prohibited, even after the discontinuation of the process of Prophethood. The reason is simple. This is a waste of time, your own and that of others.\n\nThe Holy Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) has said:                   \n\nمن حسن إسلام المرء تركه ما لا يعنيه\n\nOne of the qualities making someone a good Muslim is that one leaves what is unnecessary.\n\nThis tells us that many of our brother Muslims who keep investigating into unnecessary subjects, such as, the name of the mother of Sayyidina Musa        عليه السلام, or the precise length and breadth of the Ark of Sayyidina Nuh      عليه السلام, indulge in what has no effect on one’s conduct in life. Therefore, asking such questions is blameworthy, especially when it is already known that people who tend to ask such questions are mostly unaware of the basics of their religion. The problem is that falling for what is wasteful invariably results in making one stay deprived of doing what is necessary.”\n\nMa’riful Quran (English Translation) Vol:3 Pg:265-267 (Maktabah Darul Uloom Karachi)\n\nWe too take heed from the abovementioned advice of Hazrath Mufti Shafi Saheb (Rahmatullahi Alaih)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
