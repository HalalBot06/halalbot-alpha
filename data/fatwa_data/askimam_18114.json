  "question": "Deobandi sister wants to marry a man who does not follow any Madhab",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is the ruling on a Deobandi Sister wanting to marry a brother who does not blindly follow a mathab ie He is a Hanafi in general but follows the other imams in situations where they agree on a matter and Imaam Abu Hanifa differs?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is permissible for a Deobandi woman to marry a Muslim who does not follow a madhhab.  However, one should consider whether it would be advisable to do so as the husband might influence her or their kids with his incorrect understandings.  It would be ideal to, first, make the man properly understand and, consequently, accept the concept of taqlīd.  Thereafter, they should proceed with the marriage.\n\nFor a detailed article on taqlīd, please see the following answer by Ml. Ismail Moosa: http://www.al-inaam.com/fataawa/taqleed_shakhsi.htm.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMl.
