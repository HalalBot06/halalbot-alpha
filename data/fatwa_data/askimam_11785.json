  "answer": "QUESTION\nMe and his man love eachother dearly for the past 2 years and have been thru many ordeals but have remained strong in the end. We were about to marry, I worry deeply for him as a crisis has changed his mind about marrying me and does not want to hurt me in future in the marriage. He has lost faith in Allah to help him and is very depressed and has dissapeared from my life and from family. He is a very wonderful man with a beautiful heart and he taught me about the wonderful religion Islam which has led me to Convert. If Allah cannot help me, please I pray to help this man. He was a part of me and I was a part of him. He doesnt deserve the hardship he is going through, and Needs Allah's blessings.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMasha Allah that you have accepted Islaam and you have learnt about Islaam.
