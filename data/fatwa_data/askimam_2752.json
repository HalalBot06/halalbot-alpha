  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nThe area immediately under the navel is not to be shaven.\nThe area of shaving for a person (male / female) is above and around the\nprivate parts. If possible, it is commendable to shave around the hind\nprivate parts as well.
