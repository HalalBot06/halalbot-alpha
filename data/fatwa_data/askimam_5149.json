  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have been suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) for nearly 11 years. My symptoms are characterised by incessant, obtrusive, obscenely blasphemous thoughts, which I have no control over, and cannot seem to purge from my mind. Moreover, I suffer from another manifestation of OCD, vis, excessive hand washing and avoidance behaviour. This condition is having a debilitating impact upon my life. I would like to know the Islamic take on my situation, and does it lay the blame for my affliction firmly on my doorstep.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) may be viewed as a sickness like any\nother sickness.\n\nAs Muslims, it is out belief that sickness is from Allah Ta'ala and it is\ncompulsory upon us to be happy with the order of Allah Ta'ala. When one is\nill, he will consult an appropriate physician with the hope of getting\ntreatment to cure or control the sickness. You should view your condition in\nthe light of the above and consult with a psychologist for treatment.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
