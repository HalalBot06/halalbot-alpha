  "question": "Can i continue my fast and will it be accepted by Allah on the grounds of forgetfulness?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalaam alaykum  , today morning missed suhoor. Got up late ie. at 5.30 am . The imsak timing being 4.32 and fajr salah at 4.42 am. Thought i could have a glass of water before fajr and keep my saum. Just after a sip of water realised that it was nearly an hour after fajr salah. Was very disappointed. Now it is 10 am here and i haven't consumed anything. Can i continue my fast and will it be accepted by Allah on the grounds of forgetfulness?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIn principal, if water goes down the throat it invalidates one’s fast. Hence your fast was invalid as you sipped it after imsaak time started. You have to make qadha of your missed fast. There will be no sin upon you since you did it forgetfully.\n\n(Aap kay Masail, Vol.3, Pg.282, Maktabah Bayyinaat)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl.
