  "answer": "QUESTION\nwhat is barelwi, deobandi, soofi, salafi, wahhabi, ahle hadith, tablighi, hizbutahrir ?? what and should i follow any of them ? .. why cant i just follow my own islam ? from what i see fit and makes sense to me from the Quran and sunnah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to our understanding, you are confused over the fact that there are many sects who claim to be on the right. A similar question was asked to Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) who replied, ?You should follow my way of life and the way of my companions (Radhiallaahu Anhmu).?\n\nIt is necessary to know that Deen is not based on logic. This was the downfall of the Jews and Christianity. In numerous Ahaadith, we are called upon to follow the commands of Allah as practiced and demonstrated by Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
