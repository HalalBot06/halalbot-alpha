  "question": "Is is ok to forward blasphemous material to raise awareness about it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSir, these days I'm confused about an issue and would like to seek your guidance. There is this email making rounds these days on the net which depicts a fake picture of the Holy Prophet(pbuh) which was published in some book printed in India. Along with the picture is a note that encourages us to forward this picture to as many people as we can to raise awareness about the issue and try to put an end to it. I would like to know whether it is ok to attach that picture with the mail and forward it to my aquaintances to raise awareness about the issue. I need a definite answer in \"yes\" or \"no\" after weighing the pros and cons (raising awareness about the evil deed vs the spreading of blasphemous material). And could you please support your opinion with examples and arguments because i need to be convinced on one point of view.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt was the Sunnah of the Ulama of Deen to defend the pristine purity of Deen\nfrom all onslaughts of Baatil and interpolation. They did this by recording\nthe Saheeh (correct) Aqaaid and refuting the incorrect. To do so, they had\nto relay these Baatil Aqaaid as well, but did so in a manner that left no\ndoubt as to their correctness and non-veracity.\n\nWith regards to your specific query, it would not be correct to relay\nsupposed pictures of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) for the simple\nreason that pictures of animate objects are impermissible in Islam. One must\ntherefore refute the Baatil information without relaying the picture which\nshould be deleted. This should be sufficient to raise awareness among the\nunwary.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
