  "question": "What is the view of ulama regarding the comntroversial film Fitna by dutch filmmaker Geert Wilders?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is the view of ulama regarding the comntroversial film Fitna by dutch filmmake Geert Wilders.Are we allowed to watch it to see what is actually happening?What should we do as a reaction against such debasing film which degrade Islam and its teachings?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIn regards to your question of watching the film, we advise against it. There is no real need or benefit to watch such propagation against Islam. Written summaries and articles have been prepared regarding it to which you can refer. \n\nRegarding your question of what our reaction should be, the following should be considered:\n\nFrom the inception of Islam and the commencement of the prophet-hood of Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم the disbelievers and polytheists disseminated misinformation,  propaganda and outright lies against Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم in a vain attempt to extinguish the light of Islam. Previously, they used to promulgate that Nabi Karim صلى الله عليه و سلم was insane, bewitched or a magician. They spread this propaganda amongst the visiting pilgrims of Makka Mukaramah to dissuade them from accepting the message of Islam. However, Allah Ta'ala, in His unlimited power and wisdom, thwarted this wicked plot and caused it to backfire against them. The popularity and fame of Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم spread tremendously triggering the people's curiosity regarding his message and call. Once the people came in contact with Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم  , experienced his impeccable character and listened to the Divine revelation, they could not resist but to accept Islam.\n\nIn a similar light, the disbelievers of our era are implementing the same type of propaganda against Islam. The only difference is that in place of using the previous derogatory labels and titles such as magician and insane, they are using words such as terrorists, fundamentalists and extremists to incite hatred and fear in the hearts of unsuspecting masses. However, by the will of Allah Ta'ala, this scheme will also backfire. Allah Ta'ala states in the Holy Quran, \"they scheme and Allah also schemes, and Allah is the best of schemers.\" (3 : 54)\n\n \n\nوَمَكَرُوا وَمَكَرَ اللَّهُ وَاللَّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَاكِرِينَ\n\nIn their attempt to tarnish the message and religion of Islam, more and more people will seek the truth about Islam. In recent years, it has been noticed that there has been a substantial increase in the publics' interest regarding the tenets and traditions of Islam. The non-Muslim masses of today are just as curios regarding the message of Islam and the polytheistic pagan pilgrims were 1400 years ago. Our responsibility and duty is to follow the pristine and immaculate example of Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم by displaying good character and noble manners in our association with the non-Muslims. Once the non-Muslims personally experience the Islamic spirit, they will naturally reject the propaganda of the scandalmongers. Once they learn about the reality of Islam, they will be inclined and disposed to accepting it.\n\nFurthermore, we should educate ourselves in respect to the misinformation being propagated against Islam, namely, the verses of the Holy Quran and Ahadith of Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم which are quoted out of context to serve the purposes of such mischief-makers. We should learn the complete context and proper interpretation of these verses and Ahadith in order to educate and inform our unwary non-Muslim associates, colleagues and friends. This information is obtainable from the Ulama of your locality and readily available from various Islamic web sites. We are currently preparing an article enumerating such scandalous non-contextual quotations and objections coupled with their interpretations, elucidation and responses.\n\nDespite the immense love for Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم and Islam, we should maintain our composure and avoid every type of rash, violent and inflammatory behavior. Such actions will not assist the cause of Islam; rather, it will serve as substantiation for the claims of the propagandists against Islam.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
