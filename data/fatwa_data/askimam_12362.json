  "question": "I have found on the albalagh.net web-site an answer concerning guidance financial institution by Respected Justice Mufti Taqi Usmani - clarify",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn response to few inquiries concerning \"Guidance Financial Group\" regarding House Financing on your web-site, you have stated that based on the information provided by the group, it would be impremissible to finance house using their services, as it involves \"Riba\". I have found on the \"www.albalagh.net\" web-site an answer concerning the same institution by Respected Justice Mufti Taqi Usmani Saheb, that he has approved their method of house financing as of August 30, 2003. Please visit \"http://www.albalagh.net/qa/0015.shtml\", for details. I have tried to contact Mufti Taqi Usmani Saheb at Darul-Uloom Karachi, requesting clarification concerning financing through \"Guidance Financial Group\". So far, I am still wating to receive a reply. If you have a way of contacting Mufti Taqi Usmani Saheb directly, it would be benificial for the masses to have a joint response from the two of you, posted on your web-site, concerning \"Guidance Finalcial Group\". Please advice. Jaza-Allah-O-Khairan, Wa-As-Salaam-O-PS: You need to allow more than five seconds to fill the form to ask a question.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for your query\n\nGuidance had sent us a copy of their contract. Unfortunately due to our large workload it had slipped our mind. We have now looked into the matter once more.\n\nWe are in communication with Guidance in the hope that we can reach a common understanding on the matter. If we are able to achieve a common fatwa, well and good. This would be the ideal. If however we are unable, then one should understand that there are at times differences between Ulama, and each view should be respected.\n\nWe will follow up this matter.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best.\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
