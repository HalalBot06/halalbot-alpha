  "question": "Reward for praying kazaa salat compared to that of regular.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSince we are strictly commanded to pray salat on time otherwise there will be great punishment, what is the ruling regarding kazaa? Do we get punished if we perform kazaa since it wasn't done one time. And do we get fullreward for praying kazaa?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSalaat is one of the fundamental pillars of Islam. The order of Salaat is%0D%0Aexpressly repeated in the Qur'aan. The order of Salaat was given to%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) as a gift during Me'raaj (physical%0D%0Aascension to the heaven).%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the following two days of Me'raaj, Allah Ta'ala instructed Jibraaeel%0D%0A(Alayhis salaam) to perform each Salaat for Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam). Jibraaeel (Alayhis salaam) then informed Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam), 'The time between these two times (commencing time and%0D%0Aterminating time) is the times for the Salaats.' (Bukhari)%0D%0A%0D%0AEvery Salaat must be performed timeously. This has been emphasized by%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). It is a sin to delay Salaat within%0D%0Aits time until the Makrooh time. To completely miss a Salaat constitute many%0D%0Amajor sins. Qadhaa is to make up the missed Salaat. Obviously, that can%0D%0Anever be equivalent to Adaa (timeously performed) Salaat. In Qadhaa, the%0D%0Aobligation will be fulfilled but sincere Tawbah and Istighfaar should be%0D%0Amade for the neglect in not performing Salaat on time. A firm intention%0D%0Ashould be made never to miss any Salaat on time in future and every effort%0D%0Ashould be made to make Qadhaa of every missed Salaat in the past.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
