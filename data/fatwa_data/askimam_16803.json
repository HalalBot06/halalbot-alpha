  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question is \"Although it is not possible that their is no area where the light of Islam is not reached but what if someone didn't receive the light of Islam what would be his destiny Heaven or Hell?\nWhat if a Muslim living a sinful life goes to heaven under the Shafaat of Prophet PBUH and a Non-Muslim living a life full of humanity goes to hell?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1) There are two opinions in the Hanafi Madhab regarding this matter:\n\na) The first opinion is mentioned by Hakim al-Shahid (Rahmatullah Alayhi) in his Muntaqa that Imam Abu Hanfia (Rahmatullah Alayhi) said, \"There is no excuse for anyone to be ignorant of his Creator because of what he sees of the creation of the heavens and earth and his own self.\" He also said, \"If Allah Ta'ala had not sent a messenger, it would still have been obligatory for created beings to recognize Him through their intellect and reason ('aql).\" Therefore, at a minimum, one who never received the message of Islam must still adopt monotheism through their reason. If this was done, then it is believed that the person will be saved from the punishment.Â \n\nb) In the second opinion, the Imams of Bukhara (the latter Hanafis) had the view that belief does not become obligatory, nor does disbelief become prohibited until Allah Ta'ala has sent a prophet. They say that none of the rulings of Allah can be known except through the coming of a prophet. This is how they interpret the verse of the Holy Quran:\n\n\"And We will not punish until We send a prophet.\" (17:15)\n\nOthers have interpreted the \"punishment\" in this verse as a punishment in this world, not the Hereafter.\n\nThe first opinion mentioned is the stronger one in the Hanafi Madhab. We say that some rulings can be known without the aid of a prophet, such as the existence of Allah and His Oneness.\n\nWe must remember that Allah Ta'ala is the Most Just and All-Knowing. He will rule with fairness on the Day of Judgment. These matters should be left up to Him without us pondering over them excessively.\n\n(Al-Fiqh al-Akbar Explained, P. 205-211, White Thread Press)\n(Ma'ariful Quran, Vol. 5 P. 442-445, Darul Kitab)\n\n2) The difference between a Muslim who committed many sins and a kaafir who committed good actions in this life is that the Muslim still had Imaan in his heart, even if it was the weight of a mustard seed. The Muslim still had belief in the Oneness of Allah Ta'ala and Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam) as the final messenger. A kaafir has a belief involving shirk (associating partners with Allah Ta'ala) and a belief that Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam) was not the final messenger. A Hadith mentions:\n\nIt is related from Anas (RadiyAllahu Anhu) that the Prophet (Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam) said, \"Whoever says 'There is no god but Allah' and has a barley-corn's weight of good in his heart will come out of the Fire. Whoever says 'There is no god but Allah' and has a wheat-grain's weight of good in his heart will come out of the Fire. Whoever says 'There is no god but Allah' and has an atom's weight of good in his heart will come out of the Fire.\" (Sahih al-Bukhari)\n\nThis Hadith clearly shows that even a minimal amount of Imaan in one's heart will eventually save one from the fire of Hell. However, a Muslim who has committed many sins and has not repented will have to serve time in Hell until he is purified of his sins. Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam) will be interceding on the Ummah's behalf until the final person of the Ummah with Imaan is removed from the fire.\n\nIf anyone has a belief which associates partners with Allah Ta'ala, this is the worst possible sin which is unforgivable. Allah Ta'ala says in the Holy Quran:\n\n\"Surely Allah does not forgive the sin of ascribing partners to Him and He may forgive any sin short of that for whomsoever He wills.\" (4:116)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
