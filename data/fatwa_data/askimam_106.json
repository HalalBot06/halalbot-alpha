  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the three Madhaahib, viz. Shaaf?ee, Maaliki and Hanbaliy, Calamari is permissible irrespective of it being a fish or not.\n\nHowever, according to the Hanafiyah, it will not be permissible on account of it not being a fish. It is Makrooh Tahrimi, which in reality means it is Haraam.
