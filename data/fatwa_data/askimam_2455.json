  "question": "I would like to know whether all sins (including kabira/major sins) will be forgived after the Haj? 2. Can we (women) cut our hair just to remove split ends?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1.After Haj, it is known that an haji will be as pure as an newly born child. I would like to know whether all his past sins (like farz namaz,roza,zakat etc. all kabira sins/mistakes) will be questioned on the day of judgement (qayamath) or not? Whether he will be punished for the same or not? If yes, then which type of sins will be forgived after haj. If a person performs haj at a very old age and dies immediatly after haj, does it mean that all the sins he/she done throughout life will be forgived and will not be asked/punished. He will be directly eligible for jannath 2. Can we (women) cut our hair just to remove split ends?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person performs his Hajj correctly, then all his sins are forgiven.%0D%0AThere is a difference of opinion among the Ulama as to whether this incudes%0D%0Athe major sins.%0D%0A%0D%0ASome say that the major sins are also forgiven. Others say that the major%0D%0Asins are only forgiven by Tawbah, i.e. sincerely repenting from those sins.%0D%0AThe way to reconcile these two views is that it is only befitting of a true%0D%0AHaaji that he will, during his Hajj, make sincere Tawbah from all sins.%0D%0AThus, in this way, a person who performs his Hajj correctly, which includes%0D%0ATawbah, will have his major sins forgiven as well.%0D%0A%0D%0ABy having his major sins forgiven does not mean that his duties fall away.%0D%0AIf he did not perform Salaat, then he will still have to make Qadhaa of%0D%0Athem. Similarly, he will have to make Qadhaa for many missed fasts, and has%0D%0Ato fulfil any outstanding Zakaat. If he is permanently unable to fulfil the%0D%0ASalaat or fasts, then he should make a bequest that his heirs should pay the%0D%0AFidya (monetary compensation) for all outstanding Salaats and fasts.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the same light, if an old person performs Hajj correctly, which includes%0D%0ATawbah, then all his sins are forgiven. He will, Insha Allah, be eligible to%0D%0Aenter Jannah. This is provided that he makes a genuine effort to fulfil all%0D%0Aoutstanding duties such as Salaat, Sawm (fasting), Zakaat, etc. As far as%0D%0Athe rights of others are concerned, these will only be forgiven if either%0D%0Aone fulfils their rights or he obtains their forgiveness.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Women may cut their hair to remove split ends.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
