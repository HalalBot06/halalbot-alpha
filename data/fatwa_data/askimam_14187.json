  "question": "If I don’t get a chance to read at mosque I read at home. Am I allowed to do jamat at home with my wife as an imam normally would?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. If I don’t get a chance to read at mosque I read at home. Am I allowed to do jamat at home with my wife as an imam normally would? If yes then who does azan/iqamat? 2. If someone goes for umra, is it more encouraging for him to do maximum umras or just one umra and maximum tawafs? 3. Is there any dua my wife can read to get pregnant quicker? My wife tells me that some women use fresh alcohol after birth as an antiseptic for the vaginal area (they put it on a cotton pad and place it under the vagina). They say this is good because it prevents swelling of the rest of the body. At the moment I strongly oppose this, as it seems odd but want to ask you to make sure. jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Yes, you may perform your Salaat with Jamaat at home with your wife – if you did not manage getting the Jamaat at the Musjid. You will call out the Adhaan as well as the Iqaamat and not the wife. She will stand directly behind you and not on your side.\n\n2. More Umrahs are more virtuous.\n\n3. Ask her to recite Surah Maryam.\n\n4. If there is no other antiseptic available and she is forced to use this alcohol, she is permitted to do so.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
