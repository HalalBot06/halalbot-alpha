  "question": "I stole an amount of money from my workplace.No one knows it was me.I have left work now but cant afford to repay it nor can i tell my boss.ive askd 4 thawba by allah.should i give sadqa aswell?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe money you stole belongs to your ex-boss. You will not be absolved from this sin by merely making Tawbah to Allah. This is a right of human being and it is necessary to pay the stolen money to your ex-boss or seek his forgiveness.\n\nIf the money reaches the ex-boss without informing him the source of the money, that will suffice. Instead of giving Sadaqah, you should endeavour to pay your ex-boss.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
