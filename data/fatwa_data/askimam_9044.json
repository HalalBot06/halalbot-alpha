We were unable to trace it as any form of a Hadith of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). %0D%0A%0D%0AAs for the the second narration, great scholars like Hafiz al-Dhahabi and Hafiz ibn Hajar (RA) have classified it as a fabrication. Though there may be other Muhadditheen who have not done so. For further clarity, let it be understood that the task of authenticating Ahaadith of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is dependent on the individual theological conclusions of the Masters of Hadith. %0D%0A%0D%0ABetter still, caution would demand that we refrain from quoting narrations classified as fabrications by such scholars of Hadith. %0D%0A%0D%0AMay Almighty Allah grant us all the ability to keep to the straight path and to keep away from extremism and deviation, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
