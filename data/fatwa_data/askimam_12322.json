  "question": "If i got a drop of that Transpirent Water which discharge from men's hidden place on my dress,then can i offer Salat with that dress or i have to change that dress?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nClear fluid that is discharged is called Mazi. It is impure.\n\nHowever, if the amount on the clothing is less than one dirham (equivalent to the sunken area of the palm of a person), then Salaat would be correct. It would, however, be better to wash that as well.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
