  "question": "Can a person follow another person while prayer without knowing the niyat of the person praying?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu Alaikkum Imam, Can a person follow another person while prayer without knowing the niyat of the person praying? While I was praying alone nafil (after praying zuhur and sunat) in the office prayer area, one of my colleague entered the prayer area , and upon seeing me praying he just tapped my shoulder and started to pray along with me, as if praying in Jamaat. When I asked him how can you follow my prayer as I was praying nafil, he replied it is allowed in his country (Indonesia) to just follow whoever is praying , thinking it is Jamat prayer. My question is (1) Can a person just follow another person without knowing the niyat of other person ? (2) If they tap on my shoulder (eventhough I am praying nafil) can i change my niyat in between my prayer to Jamaat prayer niyat ? Assalamu Alaikkum\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Yes, one may follow another person without knowing his Niyyat provided\nthe person following has made Niyyah of Nafl. If both are reading the same\nSalaat, like Fardh for example, this is also in order.\n2. Yes, you may do so.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
