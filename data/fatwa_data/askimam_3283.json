  "question": "I have a question about 2 dreams I had.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs salamu alaikum I would like to ask for your interpretation of two dreams that I have had. First, I have been Muslim for about 12 years now and have hoped that, Insyah Allah, my parents would follow. I had a dream where my parents were dressed very nicely in traditional Islamic clothing and my mother was wearing hijab. They both seemed very happy and as I approached them, my father told me that they had accepted Islam. Second, I have a five-year-old daughter and I am trying to teach her as much as I can about Islam. I want her to love Allah and love Islam. I recently had a dream about her where she was with me at the Kaaba. As we got close to it, she was so excited to see it that she let go of my hand and ran up to it and put her hands on it as if she wanted to hug it. It made me happy to see her feel such joy at seeing Allah?s house. What do these dreams mean?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nBoth the dreams are a reflection of your wishes. Parents accepting Islam and\ndaughter loving Islam.\n\nMay Allah Ta'ala make the dreams a reality, Aameen. However, that can be achieved through effort and sacrifice.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
