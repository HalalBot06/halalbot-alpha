  "answer": "QUESTION\nI'm a often benefiter of this site and hence I introduced this to my fellow cousins and friends. Hope all will make use of this. Now my question is about a mail which I recently received from one of my friend. It says about a chritian lady who died 122 years ago and her body still looks fresh. Below I'm giving the mail content... \"This is the pictures of St.Bernadette who died 122 years ago in >>Lourdes,France and was buried, her body was only discovered 30 years ago >>after the church officials decided to examine her body. Her body is >>still >>fresh until today and if you ever go to Lourdes, >>France you can see her body in the church in Lourdes. Her body does not >>decay because during her lifetime, the mother of Jesus would always >>appear >>to her and give messages and advice to all mankind on the right way to >>live on this earth. Many miracles has taken place in this place of Lourdes >>and still do until today. She died 122 years ago but you can see her >>body fresh. Her body was found 30 years ago . >> >>These pictures show her body after 122 years.!!! \" I'm not giving the pics here as I don't know I to attach them. If necessary I can forward you. Now my question is, are there any Quran or Hadhees verses which quotes about such 'munafiq' information? ( I heard liers will arise in large numbers during the end of days..)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe are unable to comment on the incidents in reference.
