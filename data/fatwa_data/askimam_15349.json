  "question": "Should females pray Jumuah Salaah at home?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) please advise as a female should females read jumma salaah or zohr salaah when reading at home? 2) it is my understanding that jumma salah is meant to be read in congregation. 3) also its is permissable for a female to read any tasbeeh or zikrullah without a scarf? and what is the latest can one offer magrib salaah?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1)      A female should perform Zuhar Salaah at home on Fridays.\n\n2)      Tasbeeh and Zikrullah could be made without a scarf\n\n3)      It is not permissible to delay the Maghrib Salaah under normal circumstances, as the Nabi of Allah (sallalahu alaihi wasallam) is reported to have said that one should hasten with the Maghrib Salaah and not delay in performing it. However should there be a reason deemed to be valid in the light of the Shariah to delay Maghrib Salaah, then the latest one may perform Maghrib is before the whiteness in the sky appears (shafaq-e-abyadh or white twilight.)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
