  "question": "Say if 2 rakat taraweeh in Ramadan are under progression, can we stand in the jamat with the niyah of reading isha 4 fards first, if thats not been read as yet?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThen when they finish the 2 rakats, we get up and finish off the 4 fards? I asking because some brothers told me to get the jamah reward, one can do this? Jazak Allah Khairun.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi school of thought, the position of the Imaam's\nSalaah must be stronger than or equal to the Muqtadi's (follower's) Salaah.\nTaraaweeh Salaah is sunnah and Esha Salaah is Fardh. In view of the above\nprinciple, it is incorrect to perform Esha Salaah behind a person performing\nTaraaweeh Salaah.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best,\n\nMufti E. Desai"
