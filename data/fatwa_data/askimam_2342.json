  "question": "Is it wrong in Islam, to know about the general characteristics of people belonging to each zodiac sign.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe know that reading about future is prohibited, but what about just the characteristics? Jazakallaah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe zodiacal signs evolve from the ancient Babylonia and moved into\nChina , India, the West etc. They in turn added their traditions and\npractices\nto it .So being conceptulized by man and based on traditions and myths that\nare man made cannot be used to make a judgement that people born under the\nsame sign share the same or similar\ncharacteristics.\n\nZodiocal signs being the tools of fortunetellers and soothsayers rules out\nthe use of these\nsigns as Stated in a HAdith \" Whoever goes to a fortuneteller or soothsayer\nand believes in what he says then he has disbelived in what has been\nrevealed to Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
