  "question": "Please explain what talaaq-e-baain is and what are its implications. Is halalah neccessary for couple to reconcile even after three menstrual cycles. Kindly clarify.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) There are 3 types of talaqs. One is that talaq, when it occurs, it totally terminates the nikah, thereafter it is not permissible for the couple to live together. If they wish to reunite, then it is necessary to redo the nikah. This type of Talaaq is known as Talaaq-e-baain. [sharh-ul-bidayah p.-165] [qudoori page 148, 144]\n\n2) If three talaaqs were issued then halaalah is necessary. If one or two Talaaqs were issued, then halaalah is not necessary.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
