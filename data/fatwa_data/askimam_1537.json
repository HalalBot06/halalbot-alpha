  "question": "Assallah Mu-allaikum Imam. How can one go about strengthening one's memory and eyesight?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI read in a few Islamic Books that one should recite after every Farz Salaat, Ya-qawiyu to strenthen ones memory, and Ya-Noor for eyesight eleven times. I have been practicing this for some years now, but the other day a brother pointed out that this was Bida. Please could you kindly clarify this for me and perhaps make alternative suggestions if any. Jazakhallah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nIt has been tested that the action of reciting 'Yaa Qawiyyu' 11 times after\nFardh Salaat is a means of strengthening one's memory.\n\nJust as it is permissible to recite other Wazifas for other physical and\nspiritual benefits, so too is the recitation of Yaa Qawiyyu. However, one\nshould not regard the practise as Sunnah or else it will be innovation\n(Bid'ah)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
