  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is defination of biddah. Is every thing new in relegion i do will be consider biddah. I feel confused about this matter. I heared if some one introduce a good thing, get ajar. Then where is the border line of this good invention and biddah. Please explain, Jazkallah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, there are two types of Bidahs; a) Bidah lid-Deen, and, b) Bidah fid-Deen\n\nThe first refers to a Bidah (innovation) for the benefit of Deen ? Madaaris, libraries, etc. Such a Bidah is permissible and acceptable. The second category refers to introducing something in Deen itself and to regard it as a part of Deen. This is not acceptable.\n\nWhere a person is rewarded for introducing something, this is the first category of Bidah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
