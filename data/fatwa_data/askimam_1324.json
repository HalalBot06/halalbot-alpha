  "question": "I read somewhere that men and women are not allowed to imitate one another in regards to clothing, hair etc.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWomen have to wear underwears, and the obvious reason is because of menstruation, they need a sanitary towel to rest on the underwear. So why does it say in one of the articles here that this is an imitation of men, so women should not wear them because men wear them. And also Allah (swt) forgive me but i wanted to know that our Prophet (saw) had his hair up to his shoulders so is this an imitation of women, because we women have long hair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is prohibited for a male to imitate a salient and outstanding feature of a female and vice vesa. Males and females wearing underclothes does not fall in the prohibited category. Was salaam Mufti E Desai Fatwa Dept."
