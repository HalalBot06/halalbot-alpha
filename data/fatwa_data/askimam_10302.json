  "question": "How can one who memorises the Quraan in English not be considered as Hafeez Al Quraan? Surely knowing the meaning is just as good as not.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe definition of the Qur?aan is - that which is written in the Masaahif (books), narrated through Tawaatur (unlimited narrators).\n\nThe definition fits only the Arabic version of the Qur?aan and not the English version as that will be a translation of the Qur?aan and not the Qur?aan itself. A person who memorises the Qur?aan in English has memorised the translation and not the actual Qur?aan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
