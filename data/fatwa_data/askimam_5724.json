  "question": "Can we pray Salah at a Musallah that is just above a Bar. Difficulty with family due to their un-islamic gatherings",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am a revert to Islam and many of my family members are non-muslim still. I know that Haram wealth makes everything bought from that wealth also Haram. I have also read that those who break relations with their kinship suffer a lot in this world and in the next, as well their duas are not accepted. Sometimes I have difficulty with my family because I don’t attend any of their gatherings (Christmas, birthdays etc.). But once in a while I may go over but I am afraid to drink their juice or anything they may offer me, out of fear that the wealth that bought these things are haram. I recently received some shirts from my sister (the shirts belonged to her husband) as a gift. My sister is a house wife and her husband owns a telemarketing company which I suspect may not be fully honest to their customers. Are these things ( clothing, gifts, juice, etc.) haram for me?? And how can I keep good relations with them (family)?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is in order to perform Salaat in such a Musallah. Do not let their activity bother you. However, Muslims should be more selective as to where\nthey establish a Musallah. \n\nAs long as you occasionally visit your relatives, and maintain cordial ties with them, you will have fulfilled your duty. You will not be regarded to be ‘one who breaks ties’ if you do not attend their gatherings. In fact, it is not permissible to attend their gatherings such as Christmas and Birthdays. As far as non-Muslims are concerned, the rule is that as long as they acquire the major portion of their wealth from a method that is socially acceptable to them, then Muslims may consume items bought from such wealth, e.g a non-Muslim sells liquor or deal in interest, and from his income her buys some fruit juice and offers it to you, it is permissible for you to consume it.\n\nIf, on the other hand, he, for example, is a thief, then one may not consume items bought from such tainted sources. Remember that this rule applies to non-Muslims only. As far as Muslims, one has to judge whether the major portion of their income is from a source that the Shari’ah regards as Halaal. So, for example, a Muslims works at a bottle store, Allah forbid, his income is Haraam and one may not consume something he buys.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows best,\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
