  "question": "can a muslim eat and stay for a night or two at Qadiani colleague's house?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQadianis are not Muslims. The ruling of staying with a Qadiani at his home\nis the same as staying with a non-Muslim. If there is no genuine need to\nstay by the Qadiani colleague, then a Muslim should not do so. If there is a\nneed and there is no alternative then the Muslim will be excused. The Muslim\nshould exercise precaution when eating with non-Muslims as the food my be\nharaam or contaminated. He/She may eat vegetable meals that is not\ncontaminated with any impure ingredients. The opportunity may be embraced to\nexplain the Qadiani the correct Islamic belief with wisdom.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
