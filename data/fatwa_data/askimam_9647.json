  "question": "Can Zakaat be paid at different times, as per the needs? Doesn't Zakaat is to help poor and needy and to improve their financial conditions, rather than just paying off at one time at the year end",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAlhamdulillah I regularly help financially my near and distant family members, friends and poor and needy people at the time of thier most financially necessary situations, like Marriages, School/College fees, medical expenses, debt etc. At the end of the year, can I consider my Zakat is paid-off, if the accumulated amount exceeded my Zakat due amount. Doesn't Zakaat is to help poor and needy and to improve their financial conditions, rather than just paying off at one time at the year end and saying \"NO\" when some-one asks for help at thier necessary situations. Can't these amounts accumulate to pay-off my Zakat? Jaza-ka-ALLAH Qairan.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are few conditions in order for the Zakaat to be discharged correctly. Your Zakaat will be considered as fulfilled if these conditions were taken into consideration at the time of discharging the money throughout the year. The conditions are as follows:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. That poor Muslim, except a Hashimi is deserving of Zakaat who does not possess any gold, silver, cash, stock for trade and surplus goods i.e. non-necessities, separately or in combination of the above items to the value of Nisaab (612.36 grams silver or its equivalent value.) %0D%0A%0D%0A2. Zakaat cannot be given to a non-Muslim, a wealthy person as mentioned above, a Hashimi (children of Abbas, Haarith and Abu Taalib), ones own parents, children, and grandchildren and so on and spouse. (Raddul Muhtaar, Vol. 2, Page 69-73) %0D%0A%0D%0A3. Zakaat must be given into the ownership of the deserving person, therefore if you had paid someone?s school fees, medical expenses, debts, etc without transferring the money into his%2Fher ownership first, then your Zakaat will not be discharged. (Raddul Muhtaar, Vol.2, Page 2) %0D%0A%0D%0A4. The payer of Zakaat must make the intention of fulfilling his Zakaat at the time of discharging of the Zakaat. If the intention was not made then the Zakaat will not be discharged. (Raddul Muhtaar, Vol. 2, Page 4) %0D%0A%0D%0A5. The money paid during the year should be equivalent to the amount that is due at the end of the year. If there is a short-fall then it should be paid. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Ashraf%0D%0ADARUL IFTA ?
