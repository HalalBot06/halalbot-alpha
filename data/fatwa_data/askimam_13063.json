  "question": "Can I still go for Hajj if I have debts?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamu alaikum, I'll be buying a car soon using my credit card (something cheap, R17,500). Insha-Allah, in December I'll be able to pay off R10,000 and end of January another R4,000. The credit card will be settled by end of February, Insha-Allah. Also, my agreement with the bank is that the monthly installments will be settled via debit order from my current account. Can I still go for Hajj if I have a debt which I will be honouring while I'm in Saudi Arabia?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Hajj will be valid.\n\nDo bear in mind that if you are financing your car with an interest transaction, then this is Haraam. One should sincerely repent and desist from such transactions in future.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
