  "question": "The Masjid Administration has banned the Mufti from comming to Masjid for salaah, who thaught us in Masjid because he pointed things out to them that they did not like. is this right?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu alaikum Mufti Sahib For sometime now in our Masjid we have a Mufti who carries on classes. He was initially brought in by the administration members of the Masjid. since that time Mufti sahib has formed a connection with the jamaat and all the musallies have love for him and he as even accepeted our Masjid and Jamaat as his Jammat. however when he started speaking of rules that were not liked by the administration like the Jummah Khutbah must be in arabic and those who shave or trim their beards less than fist should not lead salaah etc., they became very insulant and even argued with him in the Masjid and Insulted him, what is the ruling about that? all the rules which he has thaught we have found to be correct after asking other scholars but we would still like you to elaborate on these points. Our Masjid administration has banned Mufti sahib from leading any salaah as he use to do in the absence of the Imam or if promted by the Imam, IS this a permissable thing they have done? secondly they have banned him from conducted any classes and to even the point of answering any questions anyone may ask him in the Masjid, is this permissable? Thirdly, they have now banned him from comming to the Masjid for even the performance of Salaah saying that he is causing fitna, is this permissable? please provide a comprehensive reply to this with all proofs and referenceses. we would like our Mufti Sahib to return and teach us. please reply quickly. Muhammad Anwaar.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly take note of the above points and our response should be read in that context.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou state that the Musjid administration brought the honourable Mufti to conduct classes in the Musjid, and now even banned him from coming to the Musjid. You state that the disagreement stemmed due to the honourable Mufti propagating certain views ? Arabic Khutbah, condemning the shortening or shaving the beard. You also state the administration stopped him from even coming to the Musjid as he is causing Fitnah. If the administration regards the propagation of the Sunnah beard, Arabic Khutba, etc. as Fitnah, then that is indeed very unfortunate.%0D%0A%0D%0AHow can the propagation of Haqq and Sunnah be termed as Fitnah? What is the basis of the administration regarding such propagation as Fitnah? The lengthening of the beard is strongly emphasised in many Ahaadith. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] had a beard. All the prophets [alayhimus salaam] had beards. The Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhum] had beards. How will the administration react upon hearing Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] himself condemning the shortening and shaving of the beard? Will they term that as Fitnah? If they do so, they risk losing their Imaan. They risk their Nikah being severed and the relationship with their wives being Haraam. Any subsequent children born to them will be illegitimate. It is sad that the propagation of the Sunnah beard and condemnation of shortening the beard is branded as Fitnah by the administration. The administration should support the Mufti in his propagation of Haqq and Sunnah. A mechanism should be put in place to discuss the issues between them and the honourable Mufti. If he presents sound proof on, for example, the Khutbah in Arabic, lengthening the beard, the members of the administration should be the first to accept that and practise accordingly. They will set an example in the community and assist the honourable Mufti in establishing a Shari?ah way of life. They will be greatly rewarded for that. If they cannot do that, they should resign as the post is an Amanat (trust) for which they will be questioned by Allah. Why hold a position and risk your hereafter for not fulfilling the right of the position?%0D%0A%0D%0AIf the community is certain that the administration is not fulfilling their duty, they should raise their objections and have the administration changed. To have an administration who cannot assist in establishing the Haqq is itself a big Fitnah. The community should put pressure on the administration to reinstate the honourable Mufti to continue his duties and services to the community.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
