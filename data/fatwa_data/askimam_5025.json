  "question": "My mother is experiencing problems with her mum who wants to destroy people's happiness.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nShe wants to know if she must invite my grandma to my brother's wedding although my grandma does not want the wedding to go ahead. My father does not want my grandma to attend because she only likes to create trouble unfortunately. This has been my mum's fate all her life, suffering under her own mother. Should my mum listen to my dad and not invite her? Will she be guilty of cutting ties even though this is not her intention? How should this situation be handled- she does not want to upset her mum nor my dad?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nSince your father's wishes should be adhered to in the house, your Mum\nshould obey your father's (her husband's) decision - especially since this\n'non-invitation' does not entail severance of family ties.\n\nNonetheless, your father should observe good conduct with his mother-in-law\nand try to please her as far as possible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
