  "question": "What is the extent of pardah? When making purdah is it okay to leave the eyes open with the rest of the face covered?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen making pardah is it okay to leave the eyes open with the rest of the face covered? If one is in the state of impurity, can one wear new dress (never worn before) or will have to take a ghusl first? Jazakallah Khairan.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta√£la mentions in the Noble Qur'an, '(O Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam), tell the believing males to lower their gazes. tell the believing\nfemales to lower their gazes ...' (Quran 24:29-30). The injunction of\nlowering the gaze is clear that it is not permissible for strange males and\nfemales to look at one another. Due to the immorality of times and weakness\nof resistance, it is compulsory for a female to cover her face which is the\nfocus of her beauty. The covering of the face conveniently facilitates the\naccomplishment of the purpose of lowering the gaze.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
