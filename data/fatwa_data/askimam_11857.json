  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhy Islam or Muslims are against Jews (in general)? Why Koran contains many verses regarding Jews in which they are cursed and it is said that Zillah is predetermined for them in this world? Also, Koran claims that they will never be able to rule the world? How Jews disobeyed Allah and his prophets and how they broke the covenants? Why did not Allah, according to His Sunnah, sent torment on Jews after they refused the clear signs from Him or His messengers?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The holy Qur?aan declares them to harbour the most enmity against us Muslims. This is one of the reasons the Muslims don?t get along with them. The main reason for this enmity stems from jealousy.\n\n2. Due to their constant transgression and pride, Allah Ta?ala has predestined disgrace for them.\n\n3. It is incorrect of you to say that Allah did not punish them. They were duly punished for all their evil misdeeds.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nchecked & approved by: mUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
