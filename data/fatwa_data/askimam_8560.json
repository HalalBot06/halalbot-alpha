  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu alaikum during discussion on ahya.org a salafi brother claims that Abdul qadir jeelaani is quoted as saying that there can be no wali in hanafi. Is it true? Is is quoted out of context?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nUnfortunately, we do not have a copy of 'Tabaqaat ibn Rajab'. Thus, we are%0D%0Aunable to certify this claim.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, the reality of affairs will comfortably refute it's apparent%0D%0Ameaning. The number of saints who were Hanafi and were accepted to be great%0D%0AWalis of Allah by their own contemporaries, as well as those that come after%0D%0Athem are innumerable. In fact, regarding Imaam Abu Hanifa (RA) himself (the%0D%0Afounder of the Hanafi Madhab), there are quotations of great Ulama who%0D%0Atestified to his extreme piety.%0D%0A%0D%0AImam Isa ibn Yunus (RA) says, 'Do not speak ill of Imaam Abu Hanifa nor%0D%0Ashould you believe anyone who does so. For verily, by the oath of Allah. I%0D%0Ahaven't seen anyone more virtuous, more pious and more greater a Faqeeh%0D%0A(theologian) than him.' (al-Intiqaa of Hafiz ibn Abdul-Barr pg.212)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe following scholars also mentioned that they didn't see anyone more pious%0D%0A(more greater a Wali of Allah) than Imaam Abu Hanifa (RA), a) Imaam Abdullah%0D%0Aibn al-Mubaarak, b) Imaam Makki ibn Ibraahim, c) Imaam Nadhar ibn Muhammad%0D%0A%0D%0AIn fact, Imaam Yazeed ibn Harun (RA) states, 'I have studied under 1000%0D%0Ascholars and I haven't seen among them anyone who was more pious and more%0D%0Aprotective over what he said than him (i.e. Imaam Abu Hanifa). (for%0D%0Areference for the above see Taarikh Baghdaad vol.13 pg.356-358; Tabyidu%0D%0ASaheefa of Allaamah Suyuti pg.106; al-Khayraatul Hissaan of Hafiz ibn Hajar%0D%0Aal-Haytami pg.97)%0D%0A%0D%0AImam Hasan ibn Saalih says, 'Imaam Abu Hanifa was extremely fearful of%0D%0AAlmighty Allah.' (Manaaqib Imaam Abi Hanifa of Imaam Dhahabiy pg.10)%0D%0A%0D%0AAfter reading the above, the fallacy of the assumed meaning of the statement%0D%0Aof Shaykh Abdul-Qaadir Jailaaniy (RA) can be understood.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
