If one has done so, there is no Kaffarah. However, Rasulullah (Salalaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has advised a Sahabi to offer Sadaqah in the same situation.\nRasulullah (Salalaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was an Arab. He belong to the clan of Banu Hashim. However, Rasulullah (Salalaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said “there is no virtue of an arab over a non arab, the most honorable among you are those who have Taqwa”. Nowadays lineage cultural backgrounds etc. have become a source of honour and pride. Many claim with much pride and passion to be from the blessed family of Rasulluah (Salalaahu Alayhi Wasallam) but it is unfortunate that their actions and appearances defy his blessed Sunnah and lifestyle. They should ponder for a moment and reflect that if indeed we are from the Family of Rasulullah Salalaahu Alayhi Wasallam, then we should adhere to his Sunnah and adopt his lifestyle.\nWhen making Qadha e Umri, you will make intention that I am performing the last Fajr Salaah that I had missed (Example) and thereafter the next and then the next. Qadha is only made of Fardh and not of the Sunnah.\nIf he has perfomed all the rituals of Haj correctly, there is no need to offer neither Kaffarah nor Dam.\nYou may recite “Rabbi la tazarni fardan wa anta khairul Waritheen” as much as possible. Wake up in the dead of night in Tahajjud Salaah and beg Allah to fulfill all your needs.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
