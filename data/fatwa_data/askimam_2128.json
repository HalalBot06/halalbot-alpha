  "question": "Is it ok for a girl to consider more than one nikah proposal at the same time?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. can a girl consider two marriage proposals at the same time? 2. I proposed to a girl not knowing that she was proposed by another brother. despite this, she told me she wanted to get to know me better (so she did not accept or reject my proposal outright). Later i found out she was talking this other brother about marriage (even after I proposed). Should she have just given me an answer and moved on? Or is it ok for her to float my proposal while she discusses with others nikah opportunities? 3. I'm not sure if i remember correctly, but there was a hadith that said that a muslim brother should not propose to a girl if he knows that someone else propose to her. so have i sinned? I did istikhara also. Please help w/ this urgent matter. Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAny kind of premarital relationship between the boy and girl is Haraam. The%0D%0Aconcept of 'getting to know one another' is the influence of the Kuffaar%0D%0Acustoms and is largely the cause of the escalating divorce rate among the%0D%0AMuslim Ummah, for Nikahs based on Haraam (unlawful practices) are devoid of%0D%0ADivine blessings which are constant source of love and affection between the%0D%0Apartners. Therefore, great care should be taken to act upon the dictates of%0D%0Athe Qur'aan and Sunnah wherein lies only good for the obedient servants of a%0D%0ABountiful Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0AAlthough a girl may consider as many proposals as received, this is no%0D%0Aexcuse for frivolous and irresponsible behaviour, thus causing ill feelings%0D%0Aand rivalry among suitors. Marriage to such a female should be very%0D%0Acarefully considered and divine guidance be sought on the matter. The%0D%0Aprohibition in the Hadith referred by you applies only when one advances his%0D%0Aproposal despite being aware that his brother's proposal has not, as yet,%0D%0Abeen rejected or is still being considered by the proposed.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
