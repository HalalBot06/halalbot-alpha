  "question": "Who are the Jahamis and Muâ€™tazilis?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease provide the historic details and timelines.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJahmiyyah%0D%0AThese are the followrs of Jahm ibn Safwaan (who was from the Jabriyyah sect ? they believe that man does not have the ability to do any action nor can he do any action). His innovations started in Tirmuz.%0D%0A%0D%0AHe was killed by Salm ibn Ahwaz al-Maadiniy in Marw at the end of time of Banu Umayyah. He conformed to the views of the Mu?tazila in negating the Sifaat Azliy of Allah Ta?ala. However, he also adopted some of his own views, e.g.:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. It is not permissible to describe Allah Ta?ala with any description that His creation is described with, because that necessitates Tashabbuh (resemblance). Hence, he negates Allah being Hayy (alive), Aalim (knowledgeable) but establishes Allah as being Qaadir (All-Able), Faa?il (Doer), Khaaliq (Creator) and none of the creation can be described with Qudrah (ability), Fa?al (actions) and Khalq (creation)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Qudrah Haadithah ? that man does not have the ability to do anything and cannot be described as having ability. Man is forced in his actions, he does not have any ability nor intention nor choice. Allah Ta?ala creates actions in him just as how he created in all other subjects. Actions are only attributed to man figuratively, just as how it is attributed to objects, e.g. tree bore fruit, the water flows, sun rising and setting, etc. Reward and punishment are forced just as how actions are forced. When force is established, then man being burdened is also force.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. The actions and movements of the people of infinity will come to an end. Jannat and Jahannum will cease after their people have entered it and taken the benefits of it and derived the necessary punishment because one cannot perceive and understand movements and actions that never end.%0D%0A%0D%0AThey have interpreted the Aayat wherein mentions, ?They will stay therein forever? to be an exaggeration and emphasis only and not a reality. They have adopted this stance through an Aayat of the Qur?aan, ?They will stay therein forever as long as the sky and earth remain unless your Lord desires otherwise.? They say that this Aayat has mentioned exceptions and conditions of infinity, and whereas there is no exception and condition for infinity.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Whoever recognises Allah (Ma?arifat) then denies or rejects with his tongue does not become Kaafir. Because Ilm (knowledge) and Ma?rifat (recognition) do not terminate by denial, hence, he is still a believer. Also, Imaan is not divided into parts, i.e. belief, saying and action. Also, the Imaan of people do not differ. Hence, the Imaan of Anbiyaa (Alayhis salaam) and the Imaan of the ordinary Ummat is the same level because Ma?arifat does not differentiate.%0D%0A%0D%0AMany of the Salaf (pious predecessors) severely opposed them.
