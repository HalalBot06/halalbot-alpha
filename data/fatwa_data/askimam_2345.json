  "question": "Is it true that doing certain adhkar gets all ours sins forgiven?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu alikum Mufti Sahab ! I read this Hadith: Abu Huraira Radhiallahu ?anhu narrated that Allah?s Messenger Shalallahu ?alaihi wa Salam said: ?Who-ever says ?Subhan Allahi wa bihamdi hi, one hundred time a day, will be forgiven all his sins even if they were as much as the foam of the sea.? Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. Does this men that if I recite 'Subhan Allahi wa bihamdi hi' all my sins will be forgiven? Or does it mean that i will just get alot of reward for reciting 'Subhan Allahi wa bihamdi hi'?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllaamah Shaykhul Hadith Moulana Zakariyyah (RA) writes in his book,\nFadhaail-e-Aamaal commenting on a Hadith of this nature, 'It should,\nhowever, be remembered that according to the verdict of the theologians, it\nis only the Saghaair (minor sins) that are forgiven by the performance of\nSalaat and other services.\n\nThe Kabaair (major sins) are not pardoned without repentance. We should,\ntherefore, in addition to saying Salaat (and in this instance Dhikr), be\nparticular about doing Tawbah (repentance) and Istighfaar (seeking\nforgiveness). Allah Ta'ala may, however, pardon by His bountiful grace, even\nthe Kabaair of any person because of his Salaat (in this instance, Dhikr).\n\nTherefore, just because Allah is Clement, Merciful and Forgiving does not\nmean that we should commit sins in the hope of getting them forgiven through\nthese actions.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
