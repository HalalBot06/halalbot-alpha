  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is the rulings on Moustache in Islam? I'm confused about this.\n\nShould the Moustache be completely removed or rather only shortened ?\n\n \n\nOne Alim in our area has long Moustache in the two corners in upper lip and he said he is following the Sunnah of Umar bin Khattab (Radhi Allahu Anhu) who used to pull his moustaches hair near the lips when he was in deep thought of something and from this it is established that Umar (Radhi Allahu Anhu) had hair on both sides of the lips.\n\n \n\nWhat is correct? Please help me finding the best option/rules. Please, also attach some graphical images in support of this so the issue can be better understood. Please, please, please.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nThere are different words in different Ahaadith pertaining to the moustache (to shorten), (Ihfaa) to shorten excessively etc. In view of the different Ahaadith, one may only trim his moustache or even shave it if he wishes to. Shaving falls in the category of Ihfaa.\n\n \n\nFine clipping of the moustache is sunnat .It is reported in a Hadith: - \"The one who does not clip his moustache is not of us.\" (Tirmizi, Nasaie). Imam Tirmizi relates on the authority of Hadhrat Ibne Abbas (RA) that the Holy Prophet sallallâhu alaihi wasallam used to trim his moustache.\n\n \n\nذكر الطحاوي في شرح الآثار أن قص الشارب حسن ، وتقصيره أن يؤخذ حتى ينقص من الإطار وهو الطرف الأعلى من الشفة العليا قال والحلق سنة وهو أحسن من القص وهذا قول أبي حنيفة وصاحبيه رحمهم الله تعالى كذا في محيط السرخسي\n\n \n\n (Al-Fatawa al-Hindiya (5:358) Maktaba Rasheediya)\n\n \n\nعن زيد بن أرقم : أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : من لم يأخذ من شاربه فليس منا\n\n \n\nEvening out the surface of the moustache without actually thinning it with a scissors etc - resulting in the exposure of the reddish area of the lip - is also proper. However, very fine clipping falls within the sunnat practice. It is stated in Fatâwa âlamgiri: - \"It is commendable to cut the moustache very fine.\" Allamah ibne Hajar (Rahimahullah) states in his commentary of Shamâil: - \"According to Imam Abu Hanifa (Rahimahullah) and his two most eminent and outstanding pupils (Rahimahullah), instead of mere clipping, it is most desirable to cut or clip the moustache very finely.\" It is reported that Imam Ahmad (Rahimahullah) was in the habit of trimming his moustache very finely.\n\n \n\nIt is permissible to abstain from clipping the two extreme ends of the moustache. Hazrat Shaikh Muhaddith Dehlawi (Rahmatullahi Alaihi)) states in his commentary of Mishkât: \"There is no problem in leaving the two corners of the lips (moustache) intact.\" Numerous authentic Ulama of contemporary times also practice this i.e the extreme ends are left intact whilst the moustache itself is clipped to a fine texture.\n\n \n\nوَكَانَ بَعْضُ السَّلَفِ يَتْرُكُ سِبَالَيْهِ هُمَا أَطْرَافُ الشَّوَارِبِ كَذَا فِي الْغَرَائِبِ .\n\n \n\n(Masaail of hair by Hazrat Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi Rahmatullahi Alaihi)\n\n(Al-Fatawa al-Hindiya (5:358) Maktaba Rasheediya)\n\n(Fataawa Mahmudiyah (19:423) Faruqiyah)\n\n \n\nIt is understood from the abovementioned explanation that it will be permissible for a male to shave or finely trim the moustache .\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
