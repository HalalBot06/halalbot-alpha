  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssala-u-alaikum 1.Respected mufti sahib, I do observe hijab but doesn't cover my face. I taqleed Imam abu hanifa(RA).Does covering face included in hijab? Also should I use obaya too to cover my whole body over my dress. 2.U have sugeested for me to recite verse 29 of Surah 23 after each salat, is it this one Qul-rabi anzilni munzila-mubarak-ow wa anta khair-ul munzileen. from surah mominoon Also for how many time should i recite it and do I need to read darood before this verse and after it. May allah reward u for ur help to all human beings\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is necessary for a woman to cover her face.(Shaami Vol.1 Pg.406) If your dress shows the shape of your body or is transparent, then it would be necessary to wear an abaya or cloak over the dress.\n\n2. This is the correct verse. There is no set number of times to recite it or specific manner, however reciting durood before many duas has been found to make them more effective.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
