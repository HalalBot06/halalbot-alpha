  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu ALaikum Mufti Sahib, A brother who follows the Shafi'i madhab says that it is not haram for him to congratulate and greet kafirs on their religious holidays like easter and christmas. My question is whether he is right or wrong. Second if he is wrong could you please provide me with some quotes from Hadith or Quran that says that congratulating kafirs on their religious holidays is not permissible. Allah Hafiz\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, 'He who\nresembles a nation is from amongst them.'\n\nNo Muslim is allowed to imitate or resemble the Kuffaar in any way. It is\nnot permissible for a Muslim to be even part of the joy held by the Kuffaar\nin their religious days.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
