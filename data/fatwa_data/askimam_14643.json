That is to purify the souls of people. If the soul of a person is purified, then all his actions and deeds will fall in line. If one does not understand the reality and purpose of life, he will engage in wrong acts and suffer grief and uneasiness. You are a youth. You are in the prime of your life. There are three phases in life. Childhood, Youth and old age. The phase of your life is like the midday sun, like the fourteenth moon, like the nutritious plant ready for consumption and like a ripe fruit. Understand the value of the phase of life you are passing through. Your youth is not there forever. Your childhood has passed by quickly, so too will your youth pass by. Soon you will approach old age. If you value youth age you could make a meaningful input to yourself and the entire world, if you abuse your youth age, then you will be causing extreme harm and danger to yourself. Don’t suffer an inferiority complex. As a human being, everyone makes mistakes. Sincerely repent to Allah and put that behind you. Now look forward and make the best use of your youth. Don’t destroy it. Rasullullah (SAW) said the youth who nurtures himself in the worship of Allah will secure for him a place under the shade of the throne of Allah. Fight those internal challenges in you. There is a biological change in you. You will feel lust and desire. Control it. Don’t approve it by thinking evil, reading evil or seeing evil. Masturbation could cost you your health and marital problems. Choose a spiritual mentor and seek regular advice and guidance from him. Be punctual in the Masjid and become an asset in the community. Don’t grief. Rise above your feelings and face the challenges of life.     \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
