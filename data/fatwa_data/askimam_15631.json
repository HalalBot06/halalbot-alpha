By means of these we will attain piety.\n \n\nوَمَنْ يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَلْ لَهُ مَخْرَجًا  وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَحْتَسِبُ\n\n“And whosoever fears Allah and has piety, then Allah will make a way out for him (from difficulties) and sustain him from means that he did not perceive.”\n\nAs human beings it is part and parcel of our existence in this world that we are put to test and placed in trying circumstances\n\nBy observing patience and carrying out righteous actions insha-Allah you will overcome the difficult situations you find yourself in.\n\nIt is not permissible for you to take the commission and not inform your boss. Islaam severely discourages deception; every Muslim will be answerable on the day of judgement with regards to his actions and with regards to those things over which he was put in charge. You will be answerable for that which your boss has entrusted to you; likewise the boss will be answerable for his treatment of the people working for him.\n\nRasulallah(صلى الله عليه و سلم  ) has stated that every human being is a Shepard over whatever has been entrusted to him, and he will be accountable for his flock.\n\nحدثنا إسماعيل حدثنى مالك عن عبد الله بن دينار عن عبد الله بن عمر - رضى الله عنهما - أن رسول الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - قال « ألا كلكم راع ، وكلكم مسئول عن رعيته ، فالإمام الذى على الناس راع وهو مسئول عن رعيته ، والرجل راع على أهل بيته وهو مسئول عن رعيته ، والمرأة راعية على أهل بيت زوجها وولده وهى مسئولة عنهم ، وعبد الرجل راع على مال سيده وهو مسئول عنه ، ألا فكلكم راع وكلكم مسئول عن رعيته » .\n\n(Sahi al Bukhaari 2:1057 Qadeemi)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMl.
