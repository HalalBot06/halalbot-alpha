  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am 23 years old and have been the victim of bad society which has costed me my Faith and my health. I am masturbating from last 15 years like i have started doing it at the age when i didn?t know what exactly i was doing and till rite now i am practicing it continuously and with intense frequency everyday. I find it difficult to write that i indulge in illicit physical relations with a Christian girl. every time i had intercourse i used to ask my Lord for forgiveness and promise Him that i wont do it again but whenever came across that girl i simply could not resist myself and commit that major sin again and again. It happened alot of times. I committed this major sin even when i was fasting. The girl got married and this thing even didn?t stop after her marriage like i was still in physical relations with that Christian girl after her marriage and still i find it difficult to control myself whenever i came across her. I am ashamed of being called a Muslim and i know for sure that my Allah is really annoyed with me after all i am breaking my promise again and again. I wonder how should i get out of this devil act. Unfortunately during all this shameful moments of my life i discovered that i am suffering from severe premature ejaculation problem, improper erection and impotence too. Please help me i have lost my religion my health. I need a way out of all this miserable life and is there any cures to all the sexual problems I mentioned earlier?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou have a major problem.
