  "question": "Please advise on what one should eat or not eat for pregnancy according to sunnah.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAlso acts which are recommended or that which one should refrain from during pregnancy. I have heard that the Nabie (SAW) has encouraged the eating of melons when pregnant - Is this sweet melons or water-melons?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nThere are many beautiful virtues and rewards for being pregnant. It is\nmentioned in a hadith that Nabi (salallaahu alayhi wassallam) is reported to\nhave said, ” Does it not please you (O woman) that when you conceive from\nyour husband while he is pleased with you, then that woman will receive such\na reward equal to that of a fasting person in the path of Allah Ta’ala and\nspending the night in ibaadah…..”\n\nEat coconut to reduce vomiting in early pregnancy.\nNabi (sallallaahu alayhi wassallam) recommended that a pregnant lady should\neat sweet melons, good pure healthy foods in moderation and dates. Dates\nshould be eaten throughout the pregnancy but especially during the latter\npart of the pregnancy. Dates are effective for the growth of the foetus,\nstrengthen the muscles of the uterus, help with the dilatation of the uterus\nduring labour and also help reduce bleeding after delivery. Dates also\nenrich breast milk. Grapefruit is a cure for all illness and also assists\nwith milk production. A glass of grapefruit every morning is excellent.\n\nAlso keep in mind that vitamins in the form of fresh fruit and vegetables\nwill help in keeping you strong and healthy. Try to eat dark green leafy\nvegetables and prunes to prevent constipation and to control anaemia. A\nwell balanced diet with all the essential nutrients should be maintained\nthroughout the pregnancy.\n\nModerate exercise is highly recommended during your pregnancy. Try to go for\nbrisk walks everyday and keep yourself physically active in the home. Take\nshort naps after thuhr salaah. Maintain your personal hygiene, if you tend\ntowards varicose veins then put your feet up on a stool whilst you are\nresting. Do simple stretching exercises daily and if you are inclined to,\nmaintain whatever exercise you can. Water aerobics is recommended as your\nbody is buoyant in water and there is less strain on it. (However, remember\nto chose a swimming pool where you will be able to maintain your modesty).\nPrevent strain on your back and try not to lift heavy items.\n\nThe Islamic education of a child begins whilst it is a foetus in utero. If\nshe recites the Quran frequently, reads verses from the Quran from memory,\nmakes lots of zikr and is constantly engaged in good deeds and thoughts,\ninsha’allah her child will be born with similar attributes. A mother who is\ncalm, serene and relaxed during her pregnancy will hopefully go through a\nrelatively easy labour and give birth to a contented baby.\n\nAvoid sinful, lewd acts and situations of anger and anguish. A mother’s\nnegative emotional experiences are detected and felt by the foetus because\nher breathing becomes heavier, her blood pressure rises and so does her\nheart beat. This impacts on the foetus. The foetus can also hear loud\nnoises and tests have revealed that the heartbeat of the foetus rises\naccording to the discomfort experienced by it.\n\nMake dua and salaah for protection from calamities in abundance. Read Ayatul\nKursi, Surah Yaseen, Surah Maryam, Surah Yusuf and Surah Mohammed. Duaas: ‘A\n‘oodhu bikalimaatil-llaahi al-ttaammaati min sharr maa khalaqa’. (I seek\nprotection in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of that which HE has\ncreated), ‘Hasbiya-llaahu wa ni’imal wakeel’ (Allah suffices us and is the\nbest guardian). ‘U’eedhuhaa bika wa dhurriyyatahaa minash-shaytwaanir-rajeem\n‘ (And I command her and her offspring to THY protection, from the evil one,\nthe rejected)\n\nMay Allah Ta’ala grant you healthy, pious offspring and make them the\ncoolness of your eyes. Ameen.\n\nand Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\nSOCIAL DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
