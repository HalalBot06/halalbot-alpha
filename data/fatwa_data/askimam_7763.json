  "question": "On 10th Zilhaj,after pelting the shaytan,doing animal sacrifice&Halq all the restrictions of ihraam have endedâ€“except sexual relations with ones wife.Does this rule apply to woman on Hayd as well?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat I am confused about is, If a woman is on hayd, after doing halaq can she now let material touch her face or does she have to stay in a state of ihraam until she becomes clean and performs ghusl? Also if she is not able to perform the tawaf-ziyarah during the five days of hajj, but does it later on (when paak) does she have to give daam, due to the delay in doing tawaf ziyarah? Pls answer soon because I am leaving for hajj in 2 weeks.May Allah aid & reward you in this.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If the sacrifice for a woman in menses is done, she will be out of Ihraam after trimming her hair. The restrictions of Ihraam will not apply any more. Therefore, if it is permissible for her to cover her face with the ordinary Niqaab touching her face.\n\n2. If Tawaaf-e-Ziyaarah is delayed due to menses, there is no penalty (Damm)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
