Any depiction of an animate object in durable form (on paper or anything else e.g. wood cloth, etc.), irrespective of where it is displayed, falls within the prohibition of numerous Ahaadith. Refer below. 2. The principle regarding all money earned through unlawful means is that it be returned to it's rightful owner, failing which, it must be given away to an eligible recipient of Zakaah on the owner's behalf without intention of reward. One may not personally benefit from such monies in any way. 3. Ta'weez means to seek protection from Allah. It is permissible to use Aayaat of Qur'an and authentically established Duas for such purposes. (Mirqaat Vol.9 Pg. 360). When utilizing these means, ones intention should always be to seek Allah's protection. If the belief enters the heart that it is the Ta'weez itself that brings luck or protection, then it is Shirk indeed and must be shunned. and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Bilaal Cassim FATWA DEPT.
