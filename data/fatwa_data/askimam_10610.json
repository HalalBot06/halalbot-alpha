  "question": "If men will be rewarded with a certain number of chaste partners in Jannah, then what will women be rewarded with?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhile a man will get many Hurs in jannah, a women would be made the queen of Jannah. Her beauty will far outshine the beauty of the hurs.%0D%0A%0D%0AUmme Salamah R.A narrates that she said to Ras%FBlullah SAW \"O Ras%FBlullah, are the women of this world superior or the h%FBrs?\" He replied, \"The women of this world will have superiority over the h%FBrs just as the outer lining of a garment has superiority over the inner lining.\" %0D%0A%0D%0AUmme Salamah R.A then asked, \"O Ras%FBlullah, what is the reason for this?\" He answered, \"Because they performed sal%E2h, fasted, and worshipped [Allah]. Allah will put light on their faces and silk on their bodies. [The human women] will be fair in complexion and will wear green clothing and yellow jewelry. Their incense-burners will be made of pearls and their combs will be of gold. They will say, 'We are the women who will stay forever and we will never die. We are the women who will always remain in comfort and we will never undergo difficulty. We are the women who will stay and we will never leave. Listen, we are happy women and we will never become sad. Glad tidings to those men for whom we are and who are for us.'\" (Tabr%E2n%EE) %0D%0A%0D%0AMuhammed ibn Ka'b Al-Qurazi t narrates from a person of the Ans%E2r (people of Mad%EEnah) that Ras%FBlullah SAW said, \"I take the oath of that Being who sent me with the truth, you are not more acquainted with your wives and houses than the people of Jannat. A person of Jannat will come to 72 wives which Allah specially created in Jannat (h%FBrs) and 2 human wives. The human wives will have virtue over the [h%FBrs] because they worshipped Allah in the world.(Targheeb Vol.4 Pg.534)%0D%0A%0D%0AThis will be the high position of the women of the world in Jannah.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf a women had more than one husband, she will choose which one of them to stay with, and she will choose the one with the best character. As for those women who never married or their husband were mushriks, they will be allowed to marry whichever worldly man, they so wish, in Jannah. Thus every man in Jannah will have 2 wives from the world.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf we have full conviction in Allah's promise that he will fulfil our every desire in Jannah, then instead of worrying about what they will get in jannah, the women should concentrate their endeavours on pleasing Allah and thus getting to Jannah. As for pleasing us in Jannah, That is Allah responsibility, so he will do His and we should do ours. The greatest pleasure in Jannah for men and women will be the very pleasure of Allah. Everything else will be secondary.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
