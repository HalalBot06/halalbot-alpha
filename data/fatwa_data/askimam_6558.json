  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) I want to know regarding the duas prayed after fard salat. Gor eg. at zohar we pray 4 sunnat, 4 fard, 2 sunnat and 2 nafl. Now should I pray the duas after the 4 fard salat or after completing the whole salat? 2) In salat after tashajjud, when standing up do I say just once Allah ho Akar and place my hands on chest or do I say it twice, once while standing up and once while placig hands on chest.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo answer your first question there is no stipulation in the Shari'ah on the%0D%0ADu'aa after Fardh Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0ATo make Du'a in any form (loudly, softly, collectively, etc.) and any time%0D%0A(before, after Fardh Salaat, etc.) is permissible. While there are%0D%0Asubstantiations for the different forms and times of making Du'a, Shari'ah%0D%0Adoes not restrict the making of Du'a in those forms or times not%0D%0Aspecifically substantiated in Shari'ah. At most, making Du'a is permissible%0D%0Aand an act of great virtue and merit. It is not permissible to project a%0D%0Apermissible act as compulsory as this is projecting a wrong view of the%0D%0AShari'ah, thus, causing distortion of Deen.%0D%0A%0D%0ATo regard the collective Du'a after Fardh Salaat or Sunnah Salaat as%0D%0Acompulsory will be Bid'ah as that projects the incorrect image of Shari'ah.%0D%0A%0D%0ALoud Du'aa after Salaat is established and proven by many Ahaadith. It is%0D%0Anarrated that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) should say after Fajr%0D%0ASalaat, 'O Allah, I ask you for beneficial knowledge, accepted actions and%0D%0Apure sustenance.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another Hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) told Mu'aadh ibn%0D%0AJabal (Radhiallaahu Anhu), 'I love you, so say after every Salaat, 'O Allah%0D%0Aassist me in your rememberance and gratefulness.' (Fataawa Mahmoodiyah%0D%0Avol.10 pg.238)%0D%0A%0D%0AYou, however, can practice certain Masnoon acts after the Fardh Salaat like%0D%0Athe reciting of Tasbeeh, i.e. 33 times Alhamdulillah, 33 Subhaanallah and 34%0D%0AAllaahu Akbar. Also, you can recite Aayaatul Kursi, when you complete all%0D%0Ayour Sunnah and Nawaafil you may then make your Du'aa.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
