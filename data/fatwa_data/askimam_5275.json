  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-o-alaikum! I wanted to know if it is allowed for a woman to take full bath during the 7 days of periods??i have heard from some people that as it results in more napaki in the bathroom so one shouldn't take bath during periods, on the other hand some people say that one should keep clean even during those days by taking full bath. I need your answer to clarify these two statements.Thank you!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is no such thing as you can't take bath during these days. You are\nallowed to bath as frequently as required.\n\nImagine what would happen if a woman is not allowed to bath for upto 10\ndays? Obviously, such unhygienic conditions cannot be tolerated in a\nreligion that maintains 'half of faith lies in cleanliness.'\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
