  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni currently work for a solicitor and have done so for the past 8 years. now my children are at school i want to go back to college and complete my law courses to be able to become a paralegal (like a solicitor but a little less qualified). if i do this is it allowed in islam? i will be doing things like sorting out people's divorces and debts and things like that. i am female so that may be an issue as well.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIn principle, a woman should stay within the confines of her home. She will be maintained by her father if she is unmarried. If there is no one to maintain her, then she may leave the confines of her home to work and earn an income. In doing so, she should try her level best to adhere to the laws of hijab. There is no prohibition in Shariah for a female to study on condition no laws of Shariah are violated in the cause of that, for example, hijab, intermingling or sexes etc. You should keep the above principles in mind when making a decision.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
