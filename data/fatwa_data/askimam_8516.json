  "question": "Can we wash clothes of many people in one washing machine?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamoalaikum mufti sahab! Can we wash clothes of many people in one washing machine, keeping in mind that they may be impure. Similarly can the clothes be given to the laundry to be washed, as they might wash clothes of different persons at once in bulk.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the washing machine is a domestic one which drains out the water several times and refills in one wash, the impure clothes washed in such a washing machine will be pure.\n\nHowever, impure clothes washed in commercial washing machines using one chemical for many washes will not be pure.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
