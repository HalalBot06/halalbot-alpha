  "question": "Can I join prayers whilst at work?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI work in a hospital and only get 1 hour break at lunch. Can i join zuhr to asr and then join Maghrib to Isha?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJoining prayers is a concession only during travelling according to the\nmajority Madhaahib. According to Imaam Abu Hanifa, even during travelling it\nis not permissible to join the two Salaats at one time.\n\nTherefore, you should exhaust every effort to perform every Salaat on time.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
