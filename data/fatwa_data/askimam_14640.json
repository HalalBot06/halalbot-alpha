  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat are the rules concerning muslim woman going to the masjid for salaath and other social gatherings? Is it preferable for them to go to certain salaaths such as Taraweeh prayers and Eid prayers?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nIt is permissible for women to go to the Masjid with the following conditions;\n\n1)      She maintains strict Hijab.\n\n2)      She does not apply perfumes and fragrances.\n\n3)      There is no intermingling in the Masjid.\n\n4)      There is nothing unIslamic in her conduct.\n\n \n\nIf any one of the above mentioned conditions are violated, then it will not be permissible for the women to come to the Masjid. Furthermore, Rasullullah (SAW) advised that the Salah of a woman is better in her home. A woman’s place is at home. If there is need for her to leave the home, she may do so on condition she practices her Hijab.\n\n   \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
