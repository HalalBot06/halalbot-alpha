However, if you purchased the house, it belongs to you.\nTherefore, after your mother passes away, the house shall return to you\nalone, not to your brothers.\n\nWe suggest this agreement between you and your mother be brought to the\nnotice of your brothers or any potential heir and be reduced to writing by\nthem as well to avoid any future problems.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
