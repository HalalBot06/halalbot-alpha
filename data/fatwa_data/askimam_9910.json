  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The message behind the website is the promotion of ?Salami? and ?Qiyam?. In other words, to stand when conveying salutations upon the beloved Master Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). We wholeheartedly agree that standing before him as a sign of respect is permissible. However, we tend to disagree on the method of conveying salaam adopted by some people nowadays. This is not sanctioned anywhere in Shari?ah.\n\n2. There are a number of issues raised in this website. Could you kindly specify which aspect of the site you require advice on?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
