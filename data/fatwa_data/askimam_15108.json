  "question": "Can i burn these manipulated scripts?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSome weeks before, i saw an advertisement in the newspaper about Quran & Science. I sent my address towards the advertiser (New Hope Mission) to get the free book on quran & science. But when i went through it , alhamdulillah, allah put some thaught in my mind  that something is wrong in this. They keep on senting booklets towards me. Only from the third booklet i understood that the book was written by a Christian who has converted from Isalm and he is trying to invite muslims towards christianity.. Regarding this, my question is that , i would like to destroy these books. If i leave it anywhere, it may reach someothers hands and it may cause trouble. Some quranic verses, both in Arabic and in our regional language (may be some words changed / manipulated with some wordsfor misleading people) is written. Can i put fire on it? or tear it into a lot many peaces so that it willnot be read by any one else?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nYou should be grateful to Allah that He has given you the ability to affricate the truth from falsehood. It is your responsibility to caution others as well regarding this deceptive method of preaching Christianity. You may get into contact with the reliable ulama of your area and put a mechanism to create the awareness in your community regarding this Fitnah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
