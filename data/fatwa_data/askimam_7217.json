  "question": "Is it a chain letter if an email has dua (supplication) and says send it to people for a miracle tomorrow?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI received a chain letter with Prophet Family Lineage and at the end of the email there was a dua. Then it said ?send it to 7 people and a miracle will happen for you.? There is nothing bad that the email says will come if you don?t send it but shaytaan puts doubt into our hearts that we should or maybe something bad will happen. Are these types of emails allowed? Is this considered a chain letter? What if our own muslims are sending them?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPassing these chain letters is a scam and a waste of resouces.\n\nYou should not waste your time in these scams. Rather being the month of Ramadaan, devote more time towards Ibaadat and supplicating to Allah Taalah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
