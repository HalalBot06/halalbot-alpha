  "question": "Assalaamualaikum. Does revealing one's hair to Ghair-Mahram nullify ones wudhu?And is one's father-in-law considered Ghayr-Mahram?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI encountered a hadith about a non-believing woman who'd taken an oath to walk the streets naked upon the birth os her child. On embracing Islam, she asked Nabi (S.A.W)how to fulfil such an oath. He replied that her displaying one strand of her hair suffices to her being considered naked.From the above, if one's wudhu is nullified by revealing one's aurah(hair), will the same apply to women who live with in-laws and cannot help but to sometimes have their husband's fathers see them without a scarf? .\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is haraam for a female:\n1. To reveal her hair to ghair Mahrams but that does not nullify her wudhu.\nHowever, as a general rule , it is Mustahab to perform wudhu after\ncommitting a sin for example, after revealing ones hair to Ghair Mahrams.\n2. A father-in-law is a Mahram to his daughter-in-law.\n\nAnd Allah Ta`ala Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
