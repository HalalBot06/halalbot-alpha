  "question": "What is sufism and what is its position in Islam if any ? Isn't Islam only the belief in and practice of the Holy Quraan and the hadith ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIslam promotes Tazkiyah - the cleaning or purification of the heart of all\nforms of spiritual filth that may impede ones spiritual progress and closer\nproximity to Allah. Now, some people realize that achieving this goal - i.e.\nspiritual purification - can only be gained by staying aloof from society\nand adhering to other stringent regulations. Such people are generally\nreferred to as Sufis. The branch they are involved with is referred to\nSufism.\n\nAs far as Sufism is concerned, it is a branch of Islam that deals in\nspiritual elevation and this is also a primary objective of Islam. In short,\nSufism is a branch of Deen (Islam). However, over the years, a number of\nun-Islamic practices have seeped into this branch. Hence, the un-Islamic\npractices of some of these 'Sufis' cannot be condoned.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai</"
