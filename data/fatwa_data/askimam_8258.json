  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have debts some I acquired when I was kaafir and some when I was Muslim, are the debts taken on when a person is kaafir and then reverts to Islam obligatory on him to pay and will he be acquiring sin assuming these debts are based on riba? I understand that in a mans family morns very excessively for him when he dies then he is punished in the grave more severely, my family is kaafir if I die they may do this will it affect me? What should I do if non Mahran kaafir women want to talk about deen I am not married? Are computers halal is TV is haraam?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In Umrah, Damm refers to payment of a penalty in the form of slaughtering of an animal in the precincts of the Haram at Makkah.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The sin of the debt based on Ribaa accumulated when he was a disbeliever will not apply once he reverts to Islam since he was not compelled to adhere to Islamic law in a state of Kufr. However, the capital amount of the debt has to be paid as the debt is of the ?human rights? category.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. The deceased is punished if his family mourns his death excessively if he requested them to do so in his lifetime. If he didn?t request them to do so, he is not responsible for their actions.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. A long chat with them is not permissible. However, one or two statements on Deen are understandable if you are convinced that your answer will incline them towards Den, there is no fear of Fitnah and you lower your gaze.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. The use of computers for Halaal purposes is permissible. The television, on the contrary, is predominantly used for Haraam hence prohibited.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Kadwa%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
