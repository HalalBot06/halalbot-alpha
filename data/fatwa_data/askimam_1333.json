  "question": "Is there any basis to the claim that the Quran consists of elaborate mathematical structures.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nExamples of mathematical structures is for example the theory by the 'Kafer' Rashad Khalifa that all the Quran is structured around multiples of the number 19. Or other theories I heard are that many of the opposite meaning words in the Quran (like Jenna and Nar, good and evil, mo2menoon and kafereen, etc.) occur in the same number of words in the Quran. i.e. is there a proven mathematical pattern or structure which stands out as a major part of the miracle of the Quran.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Quran is a book of many miracles. If it consists of a unique\nmathematical structure it will be regarded as another miracle of the Quran.\n\nAnd Allah Ta`ala Knows Best\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT"
