  "question": "What does shariah say regarding the rights of parents when going on Jammat/Jihad? Please explain with daleels if possible.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWell i have heard we need permission from parents when going on jammat/jihad as they have rights over us. The people who i have asked quote the tabiyeen who was everything but a sahabi as he never saw Rasool(S) but had everything which sahabas did and the only reason why he wasnt able to was because he had to look after his mum? Is this a valid daleel for parents to use? Basically if parents dont give permission then are we bound to please them by not going? JazaakAllah khairan\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf ones parents are old and they require the services of their child, the\nchild cannot\ngo for a jihad which is not declared fardhain without the consent of his\nparents. To stay in the service\nof ones parents is jihad itself.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT"
