  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have been advised to read 2 rakaats of salaatul istikharaa. In the salaah, I am suppose to read seven times surah fatiha and eleven times surah ikhlaas. Please advise if this is permissable and substantiate with hadith. Shukran\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is sufficient to recite Surah Fatiha and a Surah.
