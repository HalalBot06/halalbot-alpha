  "question": "Converting and marrying a married Muslim man...What would the procedure be for him to take me as a second wife? Does he have to ask her permission?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am in love with a Muslim who is also in love with me, he is married but unfortunately his wife is not very well mentally. I am willing to convert to Muslim, I am also married, not by the church (seperated for one year, not legally). What would the procedure be for him to take me as a second wife? Does he have to ask her permission? Would he have to explain how/when we fell in love? Please help me understand how we stand within the Islam?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThank you for the questions which you have submitted to the institute.%0D%0APlease do forgive me for the delay in responding sooner.%0D%0A%0D%0AI am pleased that you have decided to accept Islam and my prayer is that you%0D%0Awill seriously study this beautiful religion which was revealed over 1400%0D%0Ayears ago. You will find that guidelines have been laid down for every%0D%0Aaspect of life for every man and woman. So do consider reading the Quran (in%0D%0AEnglish) and equip yourself with knowledge which will empower you as a%0D%0AMuslim but more especially, as a Muslim woman who has a high status and%0D%0Astanding in the court of our Creator.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou ask if your intended husband has to get his first wive's permission to%0D%0Amarry again. He doesn't have to. However, it would be kinder to inform her%0D%0Aat some stage. There is no need to go into details when he informs her. It%0D%0Ais important that he uses wisdom, kindness and tact in telling her. You%0D%0Amention that she is mentally ill. He will have to consider her mental state%0D%0Aand what affect it will have on her. Am I correct in assuming that he will%0D%0Anot divorce his wife but that you are willing to be a second wife as it is%0D%0Aallowed in Islam?%0D%0A%0D%0AAnother very important aspect you should be aware of is that he will have to%0D%0A%0Atreat both of you equitably in all aspects of your lives. This means he has%0D%0Ato spend equal time with both of you; make an equitable financial%0D%0Adistribution in whatever he supplies, it has to be the same for both of you%0D%0Aetc.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou would obviously have to clear your side as far as your legal divorce is%0D%0Aconcerned. It is best that whilst you are waiting to clear these formalities%0D%0Ayou meet with Muslim sisters and learn more about Islam. You can contact%0D%0Asisters4dawaah%40yahoo.com to see if there is anyone in your area who will%0D%0Ahopefully assist you.%0D%0A%0D%0AI hope I have answered your questions satisfactorily. You are welcome to%0D%0Awrite again if you need more clarification. May both of you be guided by%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala, ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A1SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
