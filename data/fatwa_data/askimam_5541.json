  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nConsider the following: man is created from an impure speck of semen -\nsomething even his parents felt shy to talk about. He, then carries within\nhis body a host of impurities. His end will be sand and dust.\n\nVisualize this, and Insha Allah, it will eradicate this feeling of pride.\nWhenever you think of uttering abusive words, ponder over the Hadith wherein\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, pointing to his tongue, 'This\nwill certainly take a number of people to hell.' The bad temperament you\nmention, stems from pride. Once the problem of pride is sorted out, this\nwill, Insha Allah, also be sorted pout.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
