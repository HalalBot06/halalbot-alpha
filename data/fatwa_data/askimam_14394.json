  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to ask why womens are not allowed to visit kabrastan at the time of janazah or there after?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nHadhrat ibn Mas’ood (Radhiallaahu Ánhu) narrates that Rasulullah ? said, ‘I used to stop you from visiting graves, (now) visit the graves for it creates abstention (in love) for the world and reminds of the hereafter. (Mishkaat p. 154 - Qadeemi)\n\nFrom the above Ahaadith, it is clear that visiting graves was prohibited for all (men and women), and thereafter the prohibition was abrogated. Therefore, it is Mustahabb for males to visit graves. With regard to females, see the following Ahaadith:\n\nHadhrat Abu Huryara (Radhiallaahu Ánhu) narrates that Rasulullah (?) cursed women who visit the graveyards. (Mishkaat p. 154 - Qadeemi)\n\nHadhrat Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Ánha) said to Rasulullah ? ‘Oh Prophet of Allah what should I say when visiting the graves’, Rasulullah ? said, 'Assalaamu Alaa ahlud diyaar minal mu'mineena wal muslimeena wayarhamu Allaahu al-mustaqdimeena minnaa wal must'akhireena, wa innaa inshaa'a Allaahu bikum lalaahiqoona\n\nWhile Rasulullah ? taught Hadhrat Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Ánha) the Du’a when visiting the graves, he also cursed females from doing so.\n\nThe reason for prohibiting females from visiting graves is due to our corrupted environment wherein women (ly) who do not adhere to the laws of Hijaab and hence strange men are attracted towards them. Therefore, it is not permissible for young females to visit the graveyard.\n\nHowever, if the laws of the Shariah (Hijaab, intermingling, crying, etc.) are not violated then the prohibition may be set aside. Since generally the women visiting the graves are not free from the above aspects, they should refrain from doing so.\n\nIf a female visits the grave to remember death and soften without crying … there is nothing wrong if they are old. It is Makrooh (not permissible) if they are young (Shaami vol. 1 p. 665 - Maajidiyya)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
