  "question": "If I marry this woman will it be haram and how can I make it acceptible in the sight of Allah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalaamu alykum Imam. I have met a muslimah 2 1/2 yrs ago via the internet. At the time she was married but our conversations were strictly Islamic and friendly in nature. Was this action haram? Also she moved to georgia and I lost contact with her for 1 year and during that time her marriage was very bad. Her husband was disrespectful(calling her names like stupid etc.),oppressed her (wouldnt let her go out, go to school, etc.), and on occasion dated other women. She eventually asked for a divorce and was granted it by the husband after alot of fighting about it. I was talking to her during the time she asked for the divorce and she said that i wasnt the reason for it. She was gonna eventually ask for it soon. Her husband feels I broke up the family they had by talking to his wife. Now Im engaged to be married to her. Will this marriage be valid and if what needs to be done for Allah to accept it.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, it was incorrect for you to communicate with a married women.\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'A person is judged by his\nintentions.' (Bukhari)\n\nIf possible, you should use your influence and advise the woman to make up\nher home and especially if she has children from her husband and refer both\nto an Ulama Council for marriage counselling. However, if all that is not\npossible, then you may propose to marry her and communicate with her only\nafter marriage.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
