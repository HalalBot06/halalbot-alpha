  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy wife used to leave my house very often without informing me without my permission & also there parents & grand parents used to misbehave with me & My parents she left my House using abusive language with my mother in my absence for the 3rd time.i have given her one time talaq in the presence of muslim friends now she is pregnant.i know the iddat period will be upto the delivery of the baby. now she is not comimg for reconcilllation.if she changes her attitude after the delivery of the baby can i carry on my marriage life.forgive me if iam wrong.Jazakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n \n\nTalaq is the most detestable act. Islam always encourages that the couple reconcile and come to common terms. However, if after trying all means of reconciliation, there does not seem to be an end to the tunnel then only should one resort to divorce. We therefore advise that both the families compromise and come to common terms. For that identify a neutral person with whom both of you are comfortable with and could address all the differences and come to common grounds. Also consider what will be the future of your child. You should also continue to ask Allah Ta’ala for guidance and to change the bad conduct of your wife as Allah Ta’ala is the controller of hearts.\n\nAfter the completion of the iddah, you will have to make a new nikah in order to live a married life.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
