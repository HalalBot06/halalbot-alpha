  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n i had unislamic relations with the guy i love,we wanted to and still want to get married but due to my family circumstances we cannot marry now.My elder sister has to get married first and then i can get married.Unfortunately we had sex but i regret it and in my prayers ask for Allah's forgiveness.We have promised not to indulge into such a sinful act again b4 marriage.but still when we meet we hug and kiss each other,i try hard not to have any physical contact with him but when he kisses i couldnt stop myself.Both of us want to get married asap,please tell us if we can do Nikkah and then tell our parents after that.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf you make Nikah with the person, the Nikah will be valid. It will be then permissible for both of you to be in contact. Until then, any contact with the boy will be haraam and a major sin.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
