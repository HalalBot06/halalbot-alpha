  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have been selected for a job in other department and presently I am also working in another department. Now I am in dilemma whether to join new job and leave current or continue with my current  job. How to find through Islamic way which one is best for me.?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIf one of the two departments requires you to deal with what is impermissible then you should work for the other department. However, if both departments do not require dealing with what is impermissible then you should see as to which one is in the best interest for you and your family. You should also make istikhara and seek the help and blessings of Allah Ta’ala in the decision you make. You may also consider taking the advice of appropriate people for example, some senior person of the family and someone who is aware of your work situation.  We make dua that Allah Ta’ala guides you to make the best decision. Ameen! \n\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n\n\n\nMl. Sajid bin Shabbir,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
