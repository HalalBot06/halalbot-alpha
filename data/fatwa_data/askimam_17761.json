  "question": "Personal license holder",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAt work i have been asked to become a personal license holder.  This is where i go on a one day course to learn about the country's licensing laws etc...Once i have obtianed this license i would have to manage functions which involved the bar being open in the evening.  I would not be serving at the bar.  However, i would be expected to ensure the licensing laws are being upheld.  For example; no under age drinking, refusing to serve a drunk person, and the correct I.D. etc...\n\nwhat are the islamic views on me becoming a personel license holder???\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nAs Muslims it is our duty that we generate halaal income by venturing into such avenues which will be in compliance to the teachings of Islam. Many a times whilst occupied in our mundane affairs we become oblivious and unmindful of our duties resulting in us straying away from the correct path. Apart from this it is also our duty that we command with good and abstain from evil. Allah Ta’ala mentions in Surah Ma’idah:\n\nوَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ\n\nHelp each other in righteousness and piety, and do not help each other in sin and aggression. Fear Allah. Surely, Allah is severe at punishment.\n\nThis course which you wish to undertake is designed for anyone who desires to work in premises where alcohol is sold, for drinking on or off the premises - in a position where they will authorise the sale of alcohol to the public.\n\nIf we analyse the issue of attaining a personal license to control a liquor outlet or a bar, many negative factors are established i.e.\n\n1)      You will be attending such gatherings wherein the wrath of Allah Ta’ala descends.\n\n2)      It is a great possibility that you may be called out on duty at such times which clash with the times of salaah hence putting you into great difficulty.\n\n3)      Intermingling of sexes which is prohibited and despised greatly.\n\n4)      If a Muslim takes up this job and he legalises a liquor store or a bar, this will be assisting in sin.\n\n5)      All the above factors will have an effect on your spirituality.\n\nAccording to your query, you have a job already. We have studied the roles and responsibilities of a personal license holder. It is obvious that this is not the best of professions to delve into. The responsibility that you will be given are all good but we feel that this should be managed by a non Muslim. We advise you to turn down this offer considering the above mentioned negative factors.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
