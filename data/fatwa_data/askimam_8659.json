  "answer": "QUESTION\nI think that it is called siratul nu?man or something. It says in that books that the hanifi madhab is influenced by early Persian law , is this true ? And is this book accurate? Is it permissible to ask the women you are going to marry if she is fully circumcised or should you ask her guardian? Is it true that in the hanafi madhab you must make up any missed witr before performing fajr salat or else you will have to make up both witr and fajr ? If someone followed the ahmadiyya or qadiani movement and then later learn about real Islam is it necessary to retake shahada because qadianis are not Muslim and if so, should one make qaza salat only for the prayers missed after he took shahada over again? On your website you say that you don?t know what clams are , they are a kind of muscle that lives in a shell , are they permissible? Also you say shrimp is not halaal , why ? You can eat shark ( which eats seals, dolphins, pigs, humans, and every other thing that it can get find. Do all madhabs say that eating shark is halal?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. This view ? that the Hanafi Madhab is influenced by Persian Law ? is baseless. The Hanafi Madhab has its roots in Iraq ? an Arab country in which scores of Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) lived.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. It is rather shameless to pose such a question to her. If you have to know, rather ask her guardian. However, this seems like a rather irrelevant question.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. If a person is a Saahib-e-Tartib, he should first complete his missed Salaat and then the current Salaat. Since the Witr Salaat is Waajib (compulsory) according to the Hanafi Madhab, it should be made up if missed out, just like the other Fardh Salaats. A Saahib-e-Tartib is one who has five or less Qadhaa Salats on his shoulders.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. If his beliefs were Kufr beliefs, he should renew his Shahaadah and there is no need to repeat all the Salaats because he was never a Muslim in the first place.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. All such sea creatures are not permissible according to the Hanafi Madhab. Since Shark is classified as a fish, its consumption is permissible irrespective of what it eats. The diet of an animal or fish does not always influence the permissibility or prohibition of the said animal or fish.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Kadwa%0D%0A%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
