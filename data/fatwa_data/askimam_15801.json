  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs there  a hadith that states, \"if you eat haram then your whole body will tend to do wrong , or lean towards doing wrong?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIMPORTANCE OF EARNING HALAAL\n\nEarning a halaal livelihood is a command of Allah and the responsibility of every man. Hazrath Anas [radhiallaahu anhu] reports that Rasulullah [صلى الله عليه وسلم] has said: \"It is a bounded duty upon every Muslirn to earn a halaal livelihood.\"\n\nEarning halaal saves one from begging, consuming haraam and doubtful things which are truly harmful.\n\nMany aayaat as well as ahaadith have been given explaining how one should conduct oneself while seeking a halaal livelihood and regarding the importance of doing business and trade in accordance to the shariah.\n\nWe see that Hazrat Umar [radhiallaahu anhu] would not allow a person to do business until he had learnt the Islaamic manners and etiquette of running a business. Thus, it is also essential that we too, learn the correct method of dealings, trade and that of running a business.\n\nWhile doing business, one should be honest, as this will bring blessings in the trade. One should apply good conduct and also be lenient. Never should one be harsh or rude. Also, avoid swearing oaths excessively when selling.\n\nWe must also realize that earning is only a necessity and not one's object. Therefore, the business should not make one unmindful of Allah nor should it distract us from His remembrance.\n\nFurthermore, Allah says in the Quraan: \"And I have not created Jinns and men, except that they worship me.\"\n\nHere we should understand well that worship does not only mean Salaah, Fasting, Haj etc. In every aspect of life, if one will do it for Allah's sake, then that also becomes Ibaadaat (act of worship) - be it in one's eating, earning, providing for one's wife and children or spending on the family.\n\nIf one has the correct intentions, than that very same act, which outwardly may seem to be a necessity and a duty will become an Ibaadaat and a means of blessing and reward.\n\nLikewise, even in one's business, if one will do it for the pleasure of Allah, having the correct intentions, then that very same business and halaal earning, which is a responsibility and an incumbent duty upon every Muslim, can easily become a source of gaining tremendous amounts of reward from Allah Ta'ala and a means of virtues and blessings. Therefore, while running a business, one should have the intention that:\n\n1) I am working because it is the command of Allah.\n\n2) To protect my wife and children from begging and to provide halaal sustenance for them. In this way saving them from haraam as well.\n\n3) I am running this business, so that I can give employment to others so that they too, can earn a halaal livelihood.\n\n4) The way I am going to conduct the business is going to be an invitation for the non Muslims to accept Islaam.\n\n5) I will not indulge in interest, overdraft etc. and that I will close my shop at salaat times.\n\n6) From the profit I get, I will assist the poor & help in good causes, like building madaaris, masaajid, hospitals etc.\n\nThese are just some of the intentions that one should have. Also, we see that although it may be just one shop, the rewards will be so much. Therefore, the more intentions that a person will make, the greater the amount of reward he will receive. As Nabi [صلى الله عليه وسلم] has said: \"Verily actions are judged according to the intentions.\"\n\nAayaat:\n\n\"And Allah Ta'ala has made trade lawful.\" (Baqarah)\n\n\"And We have made the day a means of earning livelihood.\" (Naba)\n\n\"And it is We who have placed you with authority on the land, provided you therein with means for fulfilment of your life.\" (A'raaf)\n\n\"And there are others travelling in the land, seeking Allah's bounty.\" (Muzammil)\n\n\"And when the prayer is finished, disperse in the land and seek the bounty of Allah (by working etc.) and remember Allah much so that you may be successful.\" (Jum'ah)\n\n\"O you who believe eat from the pure things of what We have sustained you.\" (Al-Baqarah)\n\nThe Importance and Virtues of earning Halaal\n\nHadith 1\n\nHazrat Abdulla ibn Masood [radhiallaahu anhu] reports that Rasulullah [صلى الله عليه وسلم] said, \"To earn a halaal livelihood is compulsory after the completion of other Fara'idh.\" (compulsory acts)\n\nHadith 2\n\nRasulullah [صلى الله عليه وسلم] is reported to have said: \"No one has ever eaten any food which is better than that which he had earned through working with his hands, and verily Allah's Nabi, Dawood [alayhis salaam] used to eat that which he earned with his hands.\"\n\nHadith 3\n\nHazrat Abu Saeed Khudri [radhiallaahu anhu] relates from Rasulullah [صلى الله عليه وسلم] that he said: \"For every person who earns anything halaal which he eats himself or whereby he clothes himself or anyone of Allah's creation, that shall be written as a deed of charity.\"\n\nHadith 4\n\nNaseeh-al-Ansi [radhiallaahu anhu] relates from Rakb al Misri [radhiallaahu anhu] that Rasulullah [صلى الله عليه وسلم] said: \"Glad tidings to those whose earnings are halaal.\"\n\nKhalifah Hishaam bin Abdul Maalik asked Abu Haazim Makki (Rahmatullah alayh): \"How can salvation in the hereafter be achieved.\"\n\nAbu Haazim said: \"By the acquisition of wealth lawfully and spending it lawfully.\"\n\nThe Khalifah asked: \"Who can do this?\"\n\nAbu Haazim (Rahmatullah alayh) said: \"He who wishes for Jannat, Fears Jahannam and searches for Allah's pleasure. \"\n\nHadith 5\n\nHazrat Abu Hurairah [radhiallaahu anhu] says that Nabi [صلى الله عليه وسلم] has said, \"If a man brings a load of wood on his back, sells it and eats from its produce, it is far better than begging for bread and what about begging alm? Someone gives and some doesn't.\"\n\nHadith 6\n\nSayyidina Anas [radhiallaahu anhu] reports that a certain ansari once came to Rasulullah [صلى الله عليه وسلم] and begged him for something. Rasulullah [صلى الله عليه وسلم] asked him, \"Is there really nothing in your house?\" He replied. \"Yes, sire there is a hessian bag, one part of which I wear and the other part I spread when I retire to sleep, and a cup which I use for drinking water.\" Rasulullah [صلى الله عليه وسلم] said; \"Bring both to me.\" He brought the articles. Rasulullah [صلى الله عليه وسلم] took them and exclaimed, \"Who will buy these from me?\" A man replied, \"I shall buy them both for one dirham\" Rasulullah [صلى الله عليه وسلم] asked twice or thrice, \"Who will give me more?\" A man finally said: \"I shall buy them both for two dirhams.\" Thereupon Rasulullah [صلى الله عليه وسلم] gave the goods to him and gave the two dirhams to the ansari and said: \"Buy food with the one dirham and feed your family and buy with the other an axe and bring it to me.\" The ansari brought the axe. Rasulullah [صلى الله عليه وسلم] took it and with his own mubarak hands fitted the handle to it, and said: \"Go! Cut wood and sell and let me not see you for 15 days.\" The man did as he was told and came (again) after 15 days with 10 dirhams, with some of it he bought clothes and with the other he bought food.\n\nRasulullah [صلى الله عليه وسلم] said to him: \"This is better for you than that you shall appear on the day of Qiyaamat with a mark on your face to indicate that you were a beggar.\"\n\nHadith 7\n\nSayyidina Aisha (RA) reported that Rasulullah [صلى الله عليه وسلم] said: \"Whosoever in the evening is exhausted through his work, has all his sins forgiven by that evening.\"\n\nHadith 8\n\nHazrat Ka'ab bin Ujra [radhiallaahu anhu] says that Rasulullah [صلى الله عليه وسلم] has said: \"To work for himself, his children and his parents is pleasing to Allah. To earn for show or pride is the devils way.\"\n\nHadith 9\n\nHazrat Abu Saeed [radhiallaahu anhu] says that Nabi [صلى الله عليه وسلم] said: \"Whosoever maintained himself on legitimate earning, followed the prophets traditions and refrained from doing mischief, deserves Jannat and would be admitted to it.\" Those present represented that there were such people those days. Nabi [صلى الله عليه وسلم] said: \"Even after him there would be such people.\"\n\nBusiness which is done in the morning is blessed\n\nHadith 1\n\nHazrat Aisha (Radiallahu Anha) said that Rasulullah [صلى الله عليه وسلم] said: \"One should go out to seek sustenance and legitimate earning in the morning, for morning work is blessed and prosperous.\"\n\nHadith 2\n\nHazrath Sakh'r ibn Wad'ah [radhiallaahu anhu] relates that Rasulullah [صلى الله عليه وسلم] supplicated: \"O Allah bless the mornings of my people.\" Whenever he despatched a small or big army, he despatched it early in the morning. Hazrath Sakh'r was a merchant. He always despatched his goods in the early part of the day and as such his business flourished and his wealth increased.\n\nHadith 3\n\nNabi [صلى الله عليه وسلم] has said: \"Allah distributes sustenance to the people from dawn till sunrise.\"\n\nFrom “The Book of Wealth” By Ml.
