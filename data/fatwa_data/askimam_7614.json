It is Haraam for strange men to have any contact with strange women. Salaat behind such a person will be Makrooh. If one read Salaat behind such a person, the Salaat will be valid.\n\n2. We suggest you use wisdom and diplomacy in advising your parents the consequences of having such pictures. Thereafter, with their consent remove the pictures together with taking their Du?aas and blessings.\n\n3. Yes, it is true. According to the Hanafi Madhab laughing aloud in Salaat breaks the Wudhu and Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
