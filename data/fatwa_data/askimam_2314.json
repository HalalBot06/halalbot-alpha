  "question": "I would like to know who is the leader of ahle sunnat wal jamaat.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have heared that Imam Ahmed Raza Khan is the leader of ahle sunnat wal jamaat, is this true. Jazakallah Khair, Khuda Hafiz\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn order to answer your question, it is necessary to understand the term%0D%0AAhlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah`. Literally, it translates as, 'The people of the%0D%0ASunnah (way of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the Majority.'%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore, the leader of the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah` is actually Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) himself and his illustrious Sahaaba%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhum). Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'My Ummah%0D%0A(nation) will split into 73 factions, all will enter the fire save one. The%0D%0ASahaaba (companions) enquired, 'Which is that faction?' Nabi (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) replied, '(The one that follows) my way and the way of my%0D%0Acompanions.' (Mishkaat).%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) also said, 'Follow the way of the%0D%0Amajority. He who separates himself from the majority will be alone in the%0D%0Afire.' (Ibid). In view of the above Ahaadith (and similar other Ahaadith),%0D%0Athe Ulama (scholars) among the Salaf (pious predecessors) began using the%0D%0Aterm Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah` to differentiate between the path of truth and%0D%0Athe already widespread Fitnah (mischief) of sectarianism. Therefore, it is%0D%0Aobvious that the criteria for the true way will always be conformity to the%0D%0ASunnah way of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the beliefs of the%0D%0AMuslim majority.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
