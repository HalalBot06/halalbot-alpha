  "question": "Are Ismailees (Agha khanees) Muslim. 1: Are they Muslims. 2: Is it ok to work in their company.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a Sunni Muslim Alhamd-o-Lillah. I work in a company owned by Ismailees. My questions are: 1: Are they Muslims. 2: Is it ok to work in their company. 3: Can we say Assalam-o-Aleekum or Allah Hafiz to them. 4: Can we eat together with them. Please answer these questions...\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It all depends on the beliefs they hold. If they believe in Muhammad [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] as the last prophet and the Qur?aan as complete and authentic, regard them as Muslims.\n\n2. Yes, you may work for them. It is permissible.\n\n3. Here again, it boils down to their beliefs. If they are Muslim, you may make salaam to them.\n\n4. The same applies here as well. Try to determine their beliefs and act accordingly.\n\nIf you are certain that they are Muslims, eat with them, otherwise try to abstain from partaking of their meals.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
