  "question": "can read salat in a room where there are photoes on the wall?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI wanted to ask whether we can read salat in a room where there are photoes on the wall? I heard angles do not enter a room where photoes are hooked up, is this true? What about mirrors?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is not permissible to have pictures of animate objects. The angels of mercy do not enter such a house. If there are pictures of animate objects in one’s house, Salaat performed there will be Makrooh. To have mirrors in one’s room is not like having pictures of animate objects. The picture in a mirror is a reflection.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
