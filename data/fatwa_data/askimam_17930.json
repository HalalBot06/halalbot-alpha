  "question": "Can a husband drink his wifes milk?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n“During the life-time of the Prophet’s Companions (may Allah be pleased with them all) it happened that one of the Companions was making love with his wife, and in the course of love-making he (the Companion) sucked her breasts to the extent that some of the milk reached his stomach. Following that, the Companion went to Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (may Allah be pleased with him) and asked him about the ruling. Replying the man, Abu-Musa Al-Ash`ari said that the man’s wife had become forbidden for him. (i.e., like his mother)\n\nAfter that, the man went to ask `Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) about the same ruling and Ibn Mas`ud stated that there was nothing wrong with what happened. Ibn Mas`ud backed his argument by citing the Prophetic hadith, which clearly states that suckling is confined only to the two earlier years of a child. Ibn Mas`ud cited this Qur’anic verse: 'Mothers shall suckle their children for two whole years; (that is) for those who wish to complete the suckling…' (Al-Baqarah: 233)\n\nThe apparent meaning of the aforementioned verse is that the suckling, which may act as a cause of prohibition, is confined to the suckling during the first two years. After the elapse of the first two years, suckling is no longer a cause of prohibition.\n\n\nHearing the above argument, Abu-Musa Al-Ash`ari (may Allah be pleased with him) said: 'Do not ask me while this erudite scholar is there to guide .\n\nBased on this can a man drink his wifes milk? \"is confined to the suckling during the first two years. After the elapse of the first two years, suckling is no longer a cause of prohibition\".\nPlz explain me this what does this mean.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\nIt is not permissible for a man to drink the milk of his wife. The Fuqahā have strictly condemned such action. Milk is a juz (part) of a womans body. To take benefit from the juz of a human body without neccessity is not permissible.\n\n(Al-Durr al-Mukhtār, vol 3, pg 211, Sa’eed)\n\nThe incident of Abu Musā Ash’ari and Ibn Mas’ud (Radiyallāhu ‘anhuma) cannot be used to prove the permissibility of drinking the milk of one’s wife. The discussion between these two Sahaba was concerning the validity of the nikāh and not concerning the permissibility of drinking the milk of the wife. Thus, it cannot be used as proof.   \n\nAbu Musā Ash’arī (Radiyallāhu anhu) ruled that it was impermissible for the man to stay with his wife, as he drank her milk. He was under the impression that drinking milk from one’s wife establishes foster hood. He based his ruling on the verse of the Qurān that prohibits men from marrying women that fostered them.\n\nIbn Mas’ūd explained that it was permissible for the man to stay with her, as foster hood was not established. Foster hood is established when a child (up to the age of approximately two years) drinks the milk of a women. If a child beyond this age or a man drinks the milk of a woman, foster hood will not be established.\n\nThus, the discussion between these two Sahaba was regarding the validity of the nikāh and not the permissibility of drinking the wife’s milk. It is not proven that these two Sahaba permitted drinking the milk of one’s wife and neither is it proven that they justified the action of this man.\n\nمص رجل ثدي زوجته لم تحرم (الدر المختار،3/225،سعيد) \n\n \n\n( ولم يبح الإرضاع بعد مدته ) لأنه جزء آدمي والانتفاع به لغير ضرورة حرام على الصحيح (الدر المختار،3/211،سعيد)\n\nكفايت المفتي (5/166،حقانية)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
