Plz answer in detail.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for writing to the institute. You have written about your habit of masturbating for the last 9 years. I recall that this question was previously answered in detail.%0D%0A%0D%0AI wish to point out to you that it is entirely up to you to stop this habit. You are fully aware of the effects this is having on you, emotionally and physically. Allah Ta'ala has provided you with a halaal avenue whereby you can fulfill your sexual desires You have a woman who is prepared to marry you.You can go on making all sorts of excuses to carry on with your habit, thus pleasing shaitaan and earning the displeasure of Allah Ta'ala. %0D%0A%0D%0AOr you can decide that you are going to stop giving in to shaitaan and your nafs. You can start making shukr to Allah Ta'ala for giving you abundant abilities, bounties and skills to achieve specific goals in your life. The choice is entirely yours. %0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala loves you for you are His creation. Allow him to come into your life and heart by striving to act upon your knowledge of what will earn you His pleasure. You can enjoy halaal sexual gratification with your wife and there is no harm in it. Go on masturbating and know that you harm only yourself. You say you perform all your salaah. Examine yourself and your salaah. Note if you are sincere in all that you recite in your salaah. When you recite Surah Al- Fatiha you ask Allah Ta'ala to lead you to the straight path and you also declare to him that you worship only Him. Then why do you go ahead after your salaah and indulge in what you know is taking you away from the Straight path and towards earning Allah Ta'ala's wrath? %0D%0A%0D%0AI suggest that you start keeping yourself in a state of whudu all the time. Keep your tongue and heart busy with the zikr of Allah Ta'ala constantly, start reading the Quran with translation and commentary so that you can learn exactly how your are expected to conduct your daily life and what is required of you as a Muslim. Make istigfaar constantly as you go about your daily activities.%0D%0A%0D%0ALearn the true meaning of \"Laa-ilaaha illallaa\" and act upon it. Strive to act on the sunnah by learning one sunnah everyday and bring that sunnah into your life. It is only by bringing the sunnah alive into your life and heart that you will thwart shaitan and stop acting on your nafs. Avoid watching TV, reading books with pictures of women, and start lowering your gaze and dont look at non-mahram women. Get married. May Allah Ta'ala guide you, ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A1SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
