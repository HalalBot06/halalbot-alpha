  "question": "I am interested in ur faith.I want to know whats the purpose of wearing a hat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe first and primary reason is that it was part of the attire of our Beloved Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). Out of our love for him, we attempt to emulate him in every action of his, be it his dressing, eating or anything else. It is similar to how fans of a certain \"star\" imitate his every action, than out of their love for him, they ensure that they resemble him in every possible manner.%0D%0A%0D%0ASecondly, every group, nation and religious body has its uniform and dress by which they are recognised and stand out from others. The uniform of a Muslim is the dressing of our Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wasallam), through it a Muslim can be recognised anywhere and would stand out in any crowd. Wearing the hat, is an integral part of this uniform.%0D%0A%0D%0ACovering the head also serves to display the humility of a person and to remind him that regardless of his high position in this world, there is somebody viz. Allah Ta'ala who is superior to him and to whom he must bow. For more details refer to the book \"The crown of a believer\".%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMl.
