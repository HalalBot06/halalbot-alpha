  "question": "Should i remove unwanted hair before Hajj?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMufti saab I wasnt to ask that shoul women also shave/remove their unwanted hairs before going for haj or omrah as it is required for men. And is it required for womens also to remove their unwanted hairs atleast once in 40 days.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is mustahab to remove one’s unwanted hair once a week, preferably on aFriday. It is makrooh to leave the unwanted hair for forty days or more.\n\n \n\nIt is not a condition fore the validity of umrah and haj to remove ones unwanted hair. It is however desirable to remove the unwanted hair before donning the ihram for umrah or haj.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
