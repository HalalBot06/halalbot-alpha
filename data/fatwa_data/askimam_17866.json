  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI need an answer immediately because i don't want to live in sin.\n\nIs the talaq valid when it is given during the menses however when the husband gave the divorce he did not know about it. Now the husband denies that he gave two talaqs and want to get back in this case if wife does not respond the way husband wanted is the rujoh is done or both husband and wife needed to be on same page or consumate.\n\nIt is three months now and wife need to know if rujooh happened or not. so she can live in the house without thinking that divore is happeved\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nThere are three aspects to your query:\n\n1.      Talaaq given in menses\n\n2.      Husband denying giving Talaaq\n\n3.       Husband making Rujooh and wife not consenting\n\nThe answers are given as follows:\n\n1.      Talaaq issued during menses will be effective, whether the husband was aware of the menses or not.\n\nوإذا طلق الرجل امرأته في حالة الحيض وقع الطلاق (فتح القدير ،مكتبه رشيديه، ص 338،ج3 )\n\n \n\n2.      If the wife heard that the husband issued her a Talaaq, or she was informed by a reliable witness of the same, and the husband denies it, It will not be permissible for her to grant access to her husband over her.\n\n \n\n \n\nوالمرأة كالقاضي إذا سمعته أو أخبرها عدل لا يحل له تمكينه {رد المحتار ج3 ص251 سعيد}\n\nفتاوي رحمية ج8 ص283\\268}\n\n \n\n \n\n3.      If the husband makes Rujooh verbally, for example he says I take you back as my wife etc. it will take place irrespective of the wife’s reaction. Consummation is not a condition for the validity of Rujooh. Also if the wife did not positively respond to the husband in consummation, the Rujooh will be valid.\n\nقوله وتصح في العدة إن لم يطلق ثلاثا ولو لم ترض         (بحر الراحق ص50، ج4)\n\nThe Rujooh will only be valid during Iddat. If her Iddat terminated, it will not be valid. If the spouses want to reconcile, a new Nikah will need to be made.\n\nإذا طلق الرجل امرأته تطليقةً رجعيةً أو تطليقتين فله أن يراجعها في عدتها، رضيت بذلك أو لم ترض.\n\n(فتح القدير ،مكتبه رشيديه، ص 14،ج4 )\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
