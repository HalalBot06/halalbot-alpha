  "question": "Mufti Saheb... Assalam o Alaikum, here is my question regarding the validation of wadhu and male health",
  "answer": "QUESTION\na) If mazi(pre coital fluid) is so less that a person has to press the tip of his penis to release it, is the wadhu still valid and b)if a person is unaware of the release of mazi and his clothes get dry, what is the validity of salat. c)Please also tell me if releasing mazi at certain conditions, an illness, does the intensity of sexual arousal resulting in release of mazi differ from person to person naturally, im a little worried....Allah Hafiz\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Irrespective of the quantity of the Mazi or how it is released, the Wudhu\nis invalid. The basic rule is, 'anything discharged from the private parts\ninvalidates Wudhu.'\n2. The Shari'ah only holds you responsible for what you know or what you are\naware of. In the case mentioned, in spite of all necessary precautions, he\nwas unaware of the release of Mazi, he will, Insha Allah, not be held liable\nfor the Salaat performed in this manner.\n3. The release of Mazi is something natural found in every adult male. Some\nmen enjoy robust health and become aroused quickly, they would release more\nMazi than others. This is quite natural. Our question to you is, What factor\nworries you?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
