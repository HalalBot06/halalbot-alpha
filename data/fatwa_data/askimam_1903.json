However, the\nFuqahaa have explained the procedure of marriage for people intending to\nmarry from distant places, for example, England and Canada.\n\nThe procedure is: The girl, in the presence of two Shar'ee witnesses propose\nto marry the boy. The proposal and the witness be reduced to writing with\nthe relevant details, date, signatures, etc. and be sent to the boy. The boy\naccepts the written proposal in the presence of at least two Shar'ee\nwitnesses.\n\nUpon fulfilling the above mentioned procedure, the Nikah between the two\nparties living at distant lands will be complete.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
