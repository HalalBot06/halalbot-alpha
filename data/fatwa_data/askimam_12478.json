  "question": "What does Islam say regarding astral projection? Is it permissible for a Muslim to do it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn our understanding that astral projection is an experience in which a person has the feeling that their astral body (spiritual being) is temporarily separated from their physical body.\n\nIt should be understood that spirituality hold a high position in Islam and the only spirituality acceptable is that which is mentioned in the Qur?aan and Hadith. It is only with the spirituality mentioned in the Qur?aan and Hadith that a person can achieve his goal, i.e. closeness to Allah. All other types are a mere deception and should necessarily be avoided.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
