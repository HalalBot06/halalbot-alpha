Thank you\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN%0D%0A%0D%0AA Muslim can acquire the shares of a joint stock company with the following%0D%0Aconditions:%0D%0A1. The main business of the company must be Halaal (permissible) according%0D%0Ato Shari%E1h. So, a Muslim cannot invest in a company whose main business is%0D%0AHaraam, like the traditional banks, insurance companies, companies dealing%0D%0Ain wines, etc.%0D%0A2. If the main business is Halaal, but it is involved in borrowing money on%0D%0AInterest or placing its funds in an Interest bearing account a Muslim%0D%0Ashare-holder should raise his voice against this practice in the annual%0D%0Ageneral meeting of the company.%0D%0A3.

Then a similar proportion from his own dividend%0D%0Amust be given by him to a person or persons entitled to receive Zakaat.%0D%0A4. If all the assets of a company are in a liquid form and the company has%0D%0Anot yet acquired any fixed assets or any stock for trade, then the sale and%0D%0Apurchase of shares must be on their par value only.%0D%0AIf anyone of these conditions is contravened, the investment in a company is%0D%0Anot permissible in the Shari'ah.%0D%0ANB.
