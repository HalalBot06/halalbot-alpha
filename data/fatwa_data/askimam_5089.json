  "question": "I have three questions.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs sala'amu alaikum (peace be upon you) Dear scholar, I am 13 and I have just converted to Islam. I have a few questions: 1. I made my shahadah in secret because my mother is Catholic and would never have let me convert to Islam. Must I tell my parents about my coversion? 2.I do not know salat in Arabic. However, I do know how to make salat in English. Will my prayer still be valid if I make it in English? 3.I have heard that music is haram. Is this true? Is there any Hadiths to support this claim?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. It is not necessary to let them know. However, they are bound tolearn of\nyour conversion sooner or later. We suggest you employ wisdom in approaching\nyour parents. Explain to them in a very polite manner, your reasons, etc.\n2. You may temporarily recite the Qiraat, etc. in English. However, you are\ncompelled to pursue learning the Salaat in Arabic.\n3. Yes, Music is Haraam as mentioned in a number of Ahaadith. Among the\ndominant purposes of our beloved Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was\nto destroy musical instruments. (Mishkat vol.2).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
