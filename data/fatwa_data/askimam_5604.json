  "question": "How does one become an Imam? ... how much money would an Imam make, and what exactly would the duties of an Imam be",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am 16 years old and living in Boston, USA. I want to become an Imam (inshallah) In another question, you said to go to a Institute of Islamic learning, where are these found? Also, how much money would an Imam make, and what exactly would the duties of an Imam be. Salam alaykum!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are many virtues for seeking Islamic education.%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Almighty Allah Ta'ala speaks about His oneness and among those who%0D%0Atestify to that are people who have been given knowledge.%0D%0A2. In another place, Allah orders the believers to obey Allah, His prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and those who have the order. The people of%0D%0Aorder have been referred to the people of knowledge.%0D%0A3. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'When Allah intends to do%0D%0Agood to a person, He gives him understanding of Deen (religion).'%0D%0A4. In another Hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'That%0D%0Aperson who walks on the path of seeking knowledge, Allah will make his%0D%0Aenterance to paradise easy.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThere are many virtues of seeking knowledge of religion. Reverting to your%0D%0Aquery of where to seek knowledge, a renowned scholar and Sufi states,%0D%0A'Verily this knowledge (of Islam) is religion, so becareful from who you%0D%0Aseek your religion.' (Mishkaat) Human nature is stealthy and generally gets%0D%0Aaffected with knowledge. His%2Fher practices, etc. are generally directed by%0D%0Athe knowledge of the person.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf the teacher is pious and adheres to Shari'ah, that will have an effect on%0D%0Athe student. If the teacher is oblivious and unmindful of practicing on%0D%0AShari'ah, that will be the effect on the student. He will also be neglectful%0D%0Ain practicing on Shari'ah. The best way to seek Islamic education is in a%0D%0Atraditional way which is close to the Sunnah and students are reared%0D%0Aaccording to Shari'ah. A consciousness is inculcated in them to adhere to%0D%0AShari'ah which makes it easy for them to follow Deen. Alhamdulillah, in%0D%0ASouth Africa there are many such traditional institutes, among others, one%0D%0Ais Madrasah In'aamiyyah where we are based.%0D%0A%0D%0AGenerally, an Aalim (scholar) is appointed by the community as an Imaam%0D%0A(leader) of the community. His responsibility is to create an awareness of%0D%0AIslam to people and make them practice on Islam. The community takes care of%0D%0Athe needs of the Imaam which is done through a contractual agreement%0D%0Astipulating the duties and remuneration. The remuneration is merely to%0D%0Afulfil one's worldly needs. The real reward of a scholar is from Allah Ta'%0D%0Aala in the hereafter if he served Deen for the pleasure of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
