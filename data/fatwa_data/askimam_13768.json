  "question": "I would like to know what is the ruling regarding Trade Unions where you pay a regular fee for the Trade Unions' support and backing in work related issues?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) I know that in the it is permissible to have car insurance due to the fact that the law of the land makes it obligatory. However, what happens in the situation where you have insurance and you become involved in a car accident. Is it permissible to claim the money for damages for your car?\n\n2) I would like to know what is the ruling regarding Trade Unions where you pay a regular fee for the Trade Unions' support and backing in work related issues? Is it permissible?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. If you are at fault, you may claim only the amount of total instalments paid over to the insurance companies. If the other party is at fault, you may claim the total costs involved from him and he in turn will claim from his insurance companies.\n\n2. You may joint the trade union and pay the fee. However, you may only elicit their support to enable you to get what is rightfully due to you. In the case where the union assists you to extort money from the employer beyond what is due to you, it is Haraam for you to accept this money.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
