  "question": "I am married to a foreign Muslim man, but our parents are unaware of it. He told me that his parents will not approve of a foreign wife. What are my rights as his wife?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe had a nikah one year ago, after knowing each other for 11 months. It was a mutual decision based on mutual admiration and respect because our relationship had been conducted on the internet. Our love has not diminished, but my husband feels that obeying his parents command to marry a woman from his own country, is more important than fulfilling the obligations and responsibilities of our marriage. He has never provided for me as a husband should, and yet he intends to marry another woman chosen by his parents.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt was extremely irresponsible of your husband to have married you despite\nknowing his parents insistence of marrying a woman from his country. It was\nalso irresponsible of you to have committed to such an irresponsible person\nin such an irresponsible way (internet).\n\nMarriage is a major step in life and you should have exercised precaution\nbefore committing to marriage. If your husband cannot provide for you, and\nyou are unable to live with him, you may request him to release you by\nissuing you a Talaaq.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
