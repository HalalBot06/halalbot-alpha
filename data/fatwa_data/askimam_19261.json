I used to wear these but now it just doesn't seem right to me.\nQ.2 Is it permissible to keep turtles? I have them but my heart says that this isn't right\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\n \n\n1)     It is not permissible to wear football jerseys irrespective of whose names are on the jerseys, including muslims names. Names and Logos on football jerseys is an integral part of commercial sports which have many un-islamic practices within them. Purchasing and wearing such jerseys fall in the category of assisting in sin.\n\n \n\nAllah Ta’ala says,\n\n \n\nوَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ\n\nAnd do not assist in sin\n\n(Qur’an 5:2)\n\n2)     It is permissible to keep turtles.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\n \n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
