The question is if you give money or gift from the profit you will not earn much or anything so is it ok to bribe them from the interest amount\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo give or receive bribe is Haraam, whether it is through pure or interest monies. To derive any benefit from interest monies is also not permissible.\n\nTherefore, it is not permissible for you to give a bribe in your business. Whatever amount you earn is written down before the Creator of this world. You should keep your business pure from any Haraam activities.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
