  "answer": "QUESTION\nI noticed that the muazzin in our mosque, before giving azaan recites the following durood - sallallaho alannabiyye ummiye wa alihi sallallaho alayhi wassalam salatau wa salaaman alayka ya rasoollah Is it correct to recite this before giving azaan as well as before iqaamat?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf it is done silently by himself, then any form of Durood or Dhikr may be\nrecited.\n\nThe word, 'Yaa Rasulullah' should not be used since many people attach wrong\nbeliefs to these words. If these words are said aloud like the words of the\nAdhaan and Iqaamat, then this is a Bid'ah and will be Haraam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
