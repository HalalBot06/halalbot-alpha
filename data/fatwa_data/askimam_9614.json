  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle the Shafi'i madhhab regards all marine animals as halal. There does exist an opinion within the madhhab that excludes from permissibility such marine animals as resemble unlawful land animals, of which the dog and pig would be examples. However, this opinion is not the preferred position of the madhhab.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nShaykh Taha Karaan\nMADRASAH AL-ARABIYYAH AL-ISLAAMIYYAH, Western Cape - SA\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
