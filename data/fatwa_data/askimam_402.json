  "question": "If a Muslim kills a kafir in an Islamic state, what is the punshment?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe life of a non-Muslim living in an Islamic state is the same as a Muslim's life. His life is sacred and will be protected by the Islamic state. If a Muslim murders him for no justifiable Shar'ee reason, the law of Qisaas (killing by sword) will be applied on the Muslim.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
