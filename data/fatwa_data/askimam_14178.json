  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. I have heard that if anybody did umra after the month of Ramzan it is necessary to do Haj, as per hanafi maslak. How far it is true?\n\n2. I like to do Haj-e-Tamattu, can I do umra in this month and come back to riyadh (as i stay in Riyadh) and then directly join haj without doing umra again.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. If a person is in Makkah on the first of Shawwal and he has the financial ability to continue staying in Makkah until Hajj, then only Hajj is compulsory upon him if he hasn’t performed Hajj in the past.\n\n2. No, the Tamattu Hajj has to be performed in a manner whereby both the Hajj and Umrah take place in a single journey and not in two separate journeys as you wish to do.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
