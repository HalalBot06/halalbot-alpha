  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. Would you mention the many forms in which the guidance for istikarah appear to one(like dreaming etc..)?\n\n2. The husband's duty with regard to his wife's hijab: If the wife is modern and finds it hard to wear the hijab is the husband's duty done if he tells her he wants her to have an open and willing mind to wear it,tells her of the benefits of full hijab and makes dua that she wears it,instead of enforcing it on her?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1.      At the outset, one must understand that Istikhara is made when one is unsure of a particular decision. If one is confident of a particular decision there is no need to make Istikhara.\n\nOne may be guided in an Istikhara either by seeing a dream/vision that guides him/her towards a decision or a person becomes convinced of a decision after the Istikhara without seeing a dream.\n\n2.      There are two aspects to this query\n\nA) The command of Allah                     B) Wisdom in achieving ones objective\n\nAllah Taa’la has mentioned in the Quraan “Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom”. This Quranic advice applies to anyone who wishes to encourage others to follow the commands of Allah. The noble objective of getting one to obey Allah and His commands will be achieved effectively, if one adheres to this advice of the Quraan. Experience bears testimony that those who encourage others to do good in a kind, polite, and humble way are far more successful than those who are forceful and aggressive.\n\nEncouraging ones wife to wear Hijaab is the duty of the husband. However, the husband should understand the sensitivity of the matter and encourage his wife with extreme tenderness, love and affection. In the beginning he should not impose upon his wife as that could jeopardize his marriage. Certainly this will not be achived in a day. The husband should also create a Deeni environment at home that will make it conducive for the wife to wear Hijaab. The husband himself must adhere to all the commands of Allah so that the wife is also encouraged by his actions. It is futile for the husband to impose upon his wife to obey one command of Allah while he ignores any other commands. Lastly, if the husband is sincere, surely Allah will create the means for the wife to wear Hijaab. The husband should continue making Dua daily on her behalf that Allah guides her towards His obedience.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
