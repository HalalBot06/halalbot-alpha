  "answer": "QUESTION\nI love her very much. She is very nice. She is religious and says she loves me. I did istekhara and I had good feelings about her. So i am not sure what to do now. She says she has some problems and she need to take care of them first. She is trying to become more religious. So if you can pls guide me through this the islamic way. On what to do? and how to go about it. I will greatly appreciate it. Should I wait for her? or Should I just forget I love her?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, we wish to point out that according to the Shari?ah, it is Haraam to have any unnecessary contact or communication with a Ghayr Mahram (not prohibited in marriage) female.\n\nSince you had proposed marriage to the person and she has refused you, there is no point in considering her in marriage. You should move ahead with your life and consider marrying someone else.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
