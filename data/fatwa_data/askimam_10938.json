  "question": "What is called ‘pool serat’?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is called ?pool serat?? I heard that every people has to overcome this pool serat. My question is when we have to overcome this 'pool seart'? Is it before or after judgement? If we have to overcome pool serat before judgement then no meaning of judgement, On the other hand if we have to overcome the pool serat after judgement then no meaning of overcoming pool serat either. This is what I am confusing about. Please clarify me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe pul siraat is the bridge between the plains of resurrection and%0D%0AJannah. Beneath the pul siraat lays the fire of Jahannam. The Hadith%0D%0Adescribes the pul siraat having a distance of 1500 years, an incline of%0D%0A500 years, a level area of 500 years and a decent of 500 years whilst%0D%0Abeing sharper than a sword and thinner than a hair. The believers shall%0D%0Across the pul siraat in accordance with their actions. Some will cross%0D%0Ait like the blink of an eye, some like the speed of fast horses and some%0D%0Awill be dragging themselves across. The actual reality of it will only%0D%0Abe understood in the hereafter. The crossing of the pul siraat will take%0D%0Aplace after judgment. The crossing, in actual fact, is the outcome of%0D%0Ayour judgment. If you were successful then you will be able to cross the%0D%0Apul siraat. The ease or difficulty and the speed of crossing will be%0D%0Aaccording to how well the person faired at judgment. However, if he was%0D%0Aunsuccessful, he will not cross the pul siraat, but will instead fall in%0D%0Athe fire of Jahannam. May Allah save us all. Ameen%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti EBRAHIM Desai%0D%0A%0D%0A"
