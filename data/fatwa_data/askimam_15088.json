All that is required is a little courage and a little sacrifice. That will impact positively in your life and you will lead a more quality life.\n\nIf your husband divorced you, then your iddat commenced from the time of the divorce. If you were not conceived then upon the expiry of three menses, your iddat terminated and you were free to marry another person from that time. You had to observe the laws of iddat at that time. If you did not do so, that is a sin for which you should repent. However, not observing the rules of iddat does not obstruct the iddat. We also wish to advise you that Islam prohibits a fiancé/fiancée relationship. If you wish to get married, then follow all the appropriate guidelines in doing so. Do not rush into marriage. Consult appropriate people and only when you are sure about your decision, then place your trust in Allah and proceed.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai \n\nDarul Iftaa"
