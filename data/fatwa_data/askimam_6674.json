  "question": "Do I do qasr whiel going to my Hometown where I no longer live.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI used to live with my parents till 1998. Now I work in New Delhi which is around 500 kms from Lucknow, my home town. My question is that if I go to my hometown for about a week, do I offer Qasr there while offering prayers. Also, while doing Qasr do I offer sunnats alongside farz.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In this situation, you need to define your Watan-e-Asliy. If you are\npermanently living in New Delhi and intended to make it your home, then\nDelhi becomes your Watan-e-Asliy. If you go to Lucknow for visiting purposes\nand stay for less than 15 days, you will be a Musaafir and must perform\nQasr. However, if you did not intend to make Delhi your Watan-e-Asliy and\npermanent home, then Lucknow will still be said to be your Watan-e-Asliy.\nTherefore, in this case, when you return home for any amount of time, you\nwill not be a Musaafir and will have to read full Salaat.\n2. If a person is in a hurry, then he may leave out the Sunnats. However,\none should try to perform the Sunnats of Fajr in particular. If one has time\nand there is no hurry, then it is necessary to read the Sunnat-e-Muakkadah\nSalaat. (Ahsanul Fataawa vol.4 pg.71)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
