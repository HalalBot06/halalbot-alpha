  "question": "Shares obtained from banks...I cashed my free shares a while ago, however I am not sure whether this money is hallal or not, if not then what can I do with it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome time ago, a building society that I used to save money changed to a Bank. On doing so the bank gave its customers who had a certain amount of money saved in the bank a set number of free shares regardless of how much money above the threshold they had saved. I cashed my free shares a while ago, however I am not sure whether this money is hallal or not, if not then what can I do with it?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is a strong possibility that the free shares offered by the Bank is from interest monies.\n\nIn view of that possibility, the proceeds from the sales of the free shares should be given in Sadaqah (charity) to the poor and needy.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
