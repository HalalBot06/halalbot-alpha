  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a young 18 yr old muslim girl. My situation is as follows i have been proposed by someone whom i intially met on the internet in a islamic chatroom. Alhamdulilah he is practising and i have met him once face to face and have talked on the phone a few times. We share the same views and would like to get married and live a life in obedience to allah. However there are a few problems. First of all he being indian and myself pakistani the chances of my parents agreeing are virtually nil. To marry him would be without my parents permission. Secondly he lives in germany and I in uk which brings forth another problem. I have met him since he is here on a visit and will return at the end of the month. I have made istikharah several times. The first time he came in a car in my dream and asked me to accompany him but i refused because we were not married. However in my dream my parents encourage me to leave with him and to marry him so we get married. The next few times i made istikharah there was not dreams but i felt i had positive feelings. In another dream we are serving guests as a married couple. The final time i made istikharah me and him are moved into a new home and are busy setting up the new home. My question to you imam is whether i should marry him even without my parents will and what is the meaning of my dreams and please can you advice me my rights islamically and how i should go about this situation\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMarriage is a big and important step in one's life. You have to exercise\nextreme precaution in making a right decision.\n\nFor that, you require the experience and insight of your parents. They have\nlove for you and their guidance will be motivated by their love for you. It\nis, therefore, important you disclose your intentions to your parents. You\nshould also explain them the importance of Istikhaara and the outcome seems\nto be positive.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
