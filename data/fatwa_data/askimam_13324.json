One of the reasons that this was caused was because of the fact that i didnot like going to my madressa because i was extremely scared of my teachers.. now that i understand the importance..at the age of 14 .. i really want to do them over.. i have done 4 nd am on my 5th para.. but i am havin an extremely diffcult time. Its extremely hard for me to memorize.. The portion that i memorize in an hour.. i will forget after a half hour, its very hard for me to do so because its causing me much frustration nd i am extremely scared that shaytaan will use this against me nd cause my discontinuation of hifz .. please refer me to a duaa which will help me ..... i am able to memorize nyting else .. but with quraan  its very hard for me ....  and the progress is slow.. i would like to finish my memorization as fast as possible.. because my work at skool is getting harder each year.. please refer me to a duaa.. i would also like to know if i would get the gunna for forgetting the quraan even though i am trying everyting in my power to revive the forgotten verses.\n\n Jazakallah hu khair\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe commend you for your dedication to the Quraan at this young and tender age. May Allah make it easy for you and make you a strong and practicing Hafiz, Inshallah.\n\nContinue slowly trying to revive the forgotten portion. Do not become frustrated as this is the plot of Shaytaan to divert you to other things. Remain steadfast and defeat him in this. Inshallah Allah wants to take great service of Deen from you so he is preparing you from now. Make dua to Allah to help and assist you in your work. Also request your parents to make special dua for you as their dua for you is readily accepted. It is also possible that you are experiencing difficulty due to other reasons besides your memory. The environment and methods of memorising could also be some possible factor leading to your difficulty.\n\nRecite this before you start learning \"Rabbi Shrah ly Sadri Wa Yasir ly Amri Wahlul Aqdatan min lisaani Yafqahu Qawli\". This is verse 26-28 of Surah Taha (16th Juz).\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
