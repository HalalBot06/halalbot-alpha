  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan I break relations with my sister if she does not follow Shariah Rules or at least can I become angry from her for one or two months so that she can feel she is doing wrong\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFirstly, you should endervour to join relations by continuously\nencouraging her and speaking to her in a kind way. You should also apply a\nlot of wisdom and diplomacy in dealing with her. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) said, 'Good relations are attached to the throne of Allah, saying,\nwhomsoever joins me (relationship), Allah will join him and whomsoever cuts\nme off, Allah will cut him off as well.' (Mishkaat pg.491)\n\nWe should therefore be extremely careful in our approach and the way we deal\nwith our relatives. However, if she persists in doing Haraam and evil, then\nas a last resort, you may severe your relations with her, but this should be\ndone with the intention of reforming her.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
