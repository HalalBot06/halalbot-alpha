  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have commited a serious sin 15 year back by trying to sexually assault my neibour girl, girls parents got angry and they suffered from serious humiliation,at that time i never accepted the sin which i have done, which lead to cursing me by the girls parent, 15 years  passed since then i am suffering from a strange mental problem which is effecting my daily life a lot. I consulted various doctors but no body had diagnosed or treated my problem,i made ASTAKHFAAR craied and prayed for my forgiveness with ALLAH SUBHANAHITALA, i cant approch the family of the girl for asking thier forgiveness for various reason, and i dont know were are they since they left the place at that time. I am willing to do any sought of SADAKHA for pleasing ALLAH and asked his forgiveness to cure me here and Bless me forgiveness.\n\nPlease advised me what sought of Amaal i due to change my life, and make ALLAH happy here and here after.i am very much shamefull by the act i have done.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nWhen making Tawbah it is necessary that you regret the sin, make sincere Tawbah, and make a firm intention never to do the action again. Since you have also violated the rights of another person it is required that you ask for their forgiveness. If you are unable to contact them in anyway, it is hoped that you will be excused. However, if any opportunity is available in the future, you must ask for their forgiveness then. It will also be preferable for you to give some amount of money as Sadaqah, as Sadaqah cools the anger of Allah (Subhanahu WaTa’ala).  \n\nAfter having made a sincere Tawbah, it is imperative that you have a firm conviction in the acceptance of your Tawbah Allah (Subhanahu WaTa’ala) is all-Merciful and all-Forgiving. He is always ready to accept the repentance of His sinful slaves. You should not have the slightest doubt of the acceptance of your Tawbah as this will have severe spiritual ramifications. After repenting, you should try to live your life in absolute accordance with the Shariah and Sunnah of the Prophet (SallAllahu Alayhi Wa-Sallam). This will bring the utmost peace and tranquility into your life. It is a blessing from Allah (Subhanahu WaTa’ala) that he made you realize the severity of what you did and you have come to accept your mistake. From this point on you should make a firm decision and live your life only in the way that pleases Allah (Subhanahu WaTa’ala) and we pray that Allah makes this easy for you. Ameen. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl. Sajid bin Shabbir,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
