  "question": "What proof is it that Salafis are wrong? You said that taqleed is compulsory.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nGive hadith on it. Why not then do taqleed to Ahmed Raza Khan- You said it's compulsory.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe concept of Taqlid simplified%0D%0A%0D%0ATaqlid refers to the practice of an unqualified, lay person (in a specific%0D%0Afield of specialization) submitting to and accepting the authority of an%0D%0Aexpert in that field, without demanding proof and justification for every%0D%0Aview, opinion or verdict expressed by such an expert authority.%0D%0A%0D%0AImitation is a natural tendency of human existence, practiced by millions of%0D%0Apeople worldwide in every facet of life. The simplest and most tangible%0D%0Aexample of Taqlid is that of a child learning his basic alphabets at school.%0D%0AEvery child learning his alphabets is unconsciously practicing Taqlid. A%0D%0Alearner driver taking instructions from a driving instructor is practicing%0D%0ATaqlid. People going to a specialist doctor for medical treatment and%0D%0Afollowing his instructions is another example of Taqlid. A lay person%0D%0Asoliciting a legal opinion from an advocate or following the advice of a tax%0D%0Aconsultant is another common case of Taqlid. A client at an engineering%0D%0Afirm, asking for the engineer's advice on complex engineering calculations%0D%0Ais yet another instance of Taqlid in action. The millions of 'facts' in the%0D%0Amyriad of sciences such as astronomy, archaeology, etc. are all distinct%0D%0Aexamples of Taqlid. Who ever questions the 'fact' that the sun is really 93%0D%0Amillion miles away from the earth! It is taken for granted that this is the%0D%0Afindings of the 'experts' in these fields and everyone simply accepts it as%0D%0Asuch. School teachers teach these to their pupils as 'gospel truth' and%0D%0Achildren learn and memorize these 'facts' with the hope of succeeding in%0D%0Atheir exams. There are countless such examples of Taqlid in everyday%0D%0Aexistence.%0D%0A%0D%0ABy way of extension, Taqlid is the easy option for ordinary people In the%0D%0Acontext of Islamic Fiqh or Law too. Taqlid in Islam simply refers to%0D%0Aaccepting and following the verdicts of expert scholars of Islamic Fiqh in%0D%0Atheir exposition and interpretation of Islamic Law, without demanding from%0D%0Athem an in-depth explanation of the intricate processes (Ijtihad) required%0D%0Ain arriving at such a verdict. It simply means that ordinary folk do not%0D%0Ahave to do Ijtihad. The duty of ordinary people is to trustingly accept the%0D%0Aauthority of the learned scholars in this matter and act upon their%0D%0Averdicts.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn this sense, Taqlid is a great blessing for common people, for it is%0D%0Abeyond the capacity of everyone to understand the extremely complex and%0D%0Acomplicated mechanics of Ijtihad. The ability to do Ijtihad requires many%0D%0Along years of study and erudition and a great deal of exertion in acquiring%0D%0Aa mastery of various Islamic sciences.%0D%0A%0D%0AKhalid Dhorat (Mawlana)%0D%0A%0D%0A"
