  "question": "Suppose someone decides to honor God somehow, say by fasting. Suppose another person also fasts but does so partly because their Islamic government requires it. Who receives a greater reward?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFasting is to abstain from eating, drinking, and fulfilling ones carnal\ndesires from the break of dawn till dusk even in isolation and privacy in\nthe absence of any government supervision. Fasting; therefore, can only be\nfor Allah. It is precisely for that reason, Rasulullah (SAW) said that Allah\nsaid, Fasting is for me and I personally will give reward for that - or I\n(myself) am the reward for the person. (Bukhari)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
