  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs salaamu alaikum\n\nPlease help me with my Zakaat calculation.What value can I deduct as a liability and what value as assets?\n\nHow do I calculate the Zakaat payable in the following cases:\n\n\n\n\n1) The house that I live in.\n\nMarket value = R 1 800 000\n\nTotal owing to bank = R 1 200 000\n\nMonthly repayment to bank = R 14 500\n\nMonthly Income received from cottages on property = R 7 000 per month\n\n \n\n2) Flat that I have as an investment and it is currently let out.\n\nMarket value = R 200 000\n\nOwing to bank = R 50 000\n\nMonthly repayment to bank = R 800\n\nMonthly rent received = R 1 500\n\nJazakallah.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram ,\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n The house you are living in is not zakatable. Your next 12 installments to the bank may be deducted as a  zakat liability. Your flat will only be zakatable if purchase with the intention to resell. If so 200,000 is zakatable. If not, no zakat is payable. In both scenarios you may deduct the  next 12 installments as zakat liability.\n\nAs far as the rental income is concerned, whatever amount is still on hand on the day of your zakat calculation will be zakatable.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nImran Hatia\nDarul Iftaa, Madrassah In'aamiyyah"
