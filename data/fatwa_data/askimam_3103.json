  "question": "A man who trims his beard less than a fist is the khateeb in the masjid. Do you advise we pray behind him? Please explain.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat can one do if there are others who are capable of leading?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPerforming Salaah behind an Imam who shaves or trims his beard less than his\nfist, such Salaah will be valid although the Imaam is classified a Faasiq.\nIf there are other persons worthy of the Musallah, then they should be\nappointed to lead the Salaah. Being complacent with the Imaam who trims his\nbeard will result in the community being sinful.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
