  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy husband had issued second talaq. I beleive we have to perform a nikah to be husband and wife.\n\nI would like to ask you that; is will of both is necessary for such nikah or only will of husband is necesary. Do i have the right to say no to such nikah ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. First type: If the husband clearly utters, 'I divorce you' or 'I divorce\nmy wife'. In other words, he issues the divorce in such clear words that\nthere is no possibility of taking any other meaning from these words. This\nis known as 'Talaaq-e-Sareeh'. The law of Talaaq-e-Raj'ee will take place\nhere, i.e. the Nikah has not broken as yet. If the husband divorces his wife\nby uttering the words of divorce one or two times and thereafter regrets his\naction, it will not be necessary to renew the Nikah. He can live with his\nwife by revoking the divorce, for example, say 'I take you back as my wife'\nor be intimate with her. This must be done before the expiry of the Iddah.\nHowever, if the man divorced her and maintained this divorce of his, then\nthe moment the Iddah of Talaaq expires, the Nikah will break. As long as the\nIddah does not expire, the man has a choice of keeping her or not. This is\nTalaaq-e-Raj'ee.\n\n2. Second type: The husband does not utter words of divorce clearly.\nInstead, he speaks in very vague terms which could have the meaning of\ndivorce and some other meaning, e.g. get out, go away, etc. Uttering any of\nthese words or similar in which there is the possibility of several meanings\nis known as Talaaq-e-Kinaayah (unclear divorce). Talaaq will only take place\nif that was the intention of the husband. The law of Talaaq-e-Baain will\napply, i.e. the Nikah is totally annulled and will not be permissible to\nlive together without renewing the Nikah. If they wish to stay together\nagain, they will have to renew the Nikah. This is known as Talaaq-e-Baain.\n(Bahishti Zewar vol.1 pg.389)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
