  "question": "My friend has recently found out that her house was built on a very old burial site. Is there something she should do, besides moving. Thank you.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy friend has lived in her house for 30 years. She has always had problems (arguing, fighting, sickness) in her family. Is there anything she could pray or anything else she can do so she may live in peace. The house is in Yugoslavia so she does not know if the graves are of muslims or not. Thank You for taking the time to help others.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour friend should consider moving out from her house as the mere thought of\nliving at a burial site will have a psychological effect of her. It is\nprobably for that reason she attributes her problems of arguing, fighting\nand sickness to living there.\n\nIf she is unable to move out for whatever reason, she should fulfil the\ninjunction of Shari'ah by performing her daily Salaat, reciting the Qur'aan\npunctually and making Du'aa. Insha Allah, by doing so, Allah will remove her\ndifficulties.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
