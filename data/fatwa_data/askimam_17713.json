  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs salam alai kum wr wb ,\n\nI would like to know your stand on Fazail-e-amal which is being read in Many masjid by People belonging to the tableegh jamaat. I belive you are aware of   errors inside the book regards to weak hadeeths & also interpreation of dreams attributed to Prophet saws.\n\nEg.  Moulana Zakariyah mentions in Fazaail-e-Aamaal: - \n\n “Shaytaan does not have the power to declare himself a Prophet in a dream.”“It is impossible that that the person dreaming may misunderstand Shaytaan as the Holy Prophet.” “If the person does not see the Prophet in a good feature, then that is the fault of the dreamer.” “If the person sees the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) doing an unlawful act, then the dream need interpretation in light of Islamic law even though (the person who dreamt) may be a pious saint.”[1]\n\nref: Fazaail-e-Aamaal, (Eng. Trans.), Virtues of Darood , Chapter.2, p.67. (Edt. 1985, Published by Dini Book Depot - Delhi.\n\nAlso regarding tawassul of prophet saws which even according to imam abu hanifa was never allowed, then why is it practised  by hanafis & many tableegh jamat .\n\nSee proof: \n\n It occurs in Durrul-Mukhtar (a famous book on Hanafee Fiqh) (2/630), ‘From Abu Haneefah: “It is not fitting at all that anyone should supplicate to Allah except by Him (Allah), and using such supplications have been permitted and ordered in the like of the Saying of Allah, the Most High, “And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call upon Him by them.”\n\nAlso---->  Its like is also found in al-Fatawa al-Hindiyyah (5/280), and al-Qudooree[3] said in his large book of Fiqh called Sharahul- harkhee in the chapter of detested matters: “Bishr Ibn al-Waleed said: ‘Abu Yusuf (one of the main students of Imam Abu Haneefah) narrated to us that Abu Haneefah said: ‘It is not right that anyone should supplicate to Allah except by Him, and I hate that anyone should say: ‘By the right of so and so’ or ‘By the right of your Prophets and Messengers’ or ‘By the right of your sacred house and the sacred area (of Muzdalifah).”\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nHow unfortunate it is that in matters related to our worldly affairs we are always looking for the experts of the field. If someone wants to put up a structure, he will look for an experienced architect, builder etc. He will not just call any Zaid or Bakr to draw his plans. On the contrary when it comes to matters of religion, everyone becomes their own specialist of the field despite him not knowing and understanding the very basics of Islamic law. They also pluck the courage of becoming arbiters and passing verdicts over the authorities of Islamic law. These were mountains of knowledge. They thoroughly understood shariah, Quran and Hadith before penning anything. They passed verdicts and interpreted Ahadith only after gathering the different variations of any Hadith. They also understood what is saheeh, hasan and da’eef and what are their implications. Where could it be used and where it could not be. These were masters of knowledge.\n\nWhat fault there is in any book containing weak narrations, if the author did not take it upon himself that he will not mention any weak narrations? A study of the six famous books of Hadith will prove that they too contain some weak narrations. The vast majority of scholars accept weak narrations, especially when it is related to fadha’il. But unfortunately the modern day homemade, unbaked, microwave “scholars” through their sheer ignorance totally reject such narrations.\n\nThe examples given in your query is sufficient prove to show your ignorance. Firstly, the Ahadith regarding seeing the Noble Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلمin a dream aren’t weak. Secondly, the interpretation given by Allama Shaykh al-Hadith رحمه الله تعالى is totally correct. This explanation was also given by great scholars like Mullah Ali Qari رحمه الله تعالى and Allamah Munawi رحمه الله تعالى. \n\n \n\nRegarding the second part of your query, the given so called proofs do not have any link with tawassul. Therefore, we see no need in wasting time in responding to them.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl. Ishaq E.
