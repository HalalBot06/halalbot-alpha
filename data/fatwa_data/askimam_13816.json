Rasulullah (Sallallahu-Alaihiwasallam) was certainly a human being as also mentioned in the Quran and Ahadith. Allah Ta'ala also refers to him as Noor (light) as his teachings were means of guidance and light for people. The explanation of Rasulullah being Noor and not a human being is incorrect.\n\n2. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] is alive in his blessed grave. This is also the condition with every Prophet. The earth does not consume them. Allah Ta’ala informs Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] about his Ummah through the angels. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] is not Aalmul Ghayb and he is not like Allah who knows everything directly.\n\n3. The love for Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] is an integral part of Islam. We are ordered to obey Allah and His Rasul [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. Love and obedience are closely linked. When a person loves someone, he obeys the person. Allah states, ‘Say (Oh Muhammad) if your fathers, your children, your brothers, your wives, your family, your wealth that you have accumulated and your business which you fear its loss and your houses which you love are more beloved that Allah and His Rasul [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], then wait until Allah brings his order (punishment).\n\nIt is clear from this verse that the love for Allah and His Rasul [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] should supercede all love, including love for near ones and dear things. This is further explained in the following Hadith. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘None of you can be a perfect believer until I am more beloved to you than his father, child and all of mankind.’ There are two types of love – natural and inculcative. The example of natural love is the love between the mother and her child. It is a love beyond any reason. That is the type of love an Ummati should have for Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and that was the type of love the Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhum] had for Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. They fully complied with the order of the Qur’aan and Hadith regarding the extent of the love for Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. Consider two incidents:\n\nIncident One: One Sahaabi was taken as captive by the enemies and he was about to be killed. Abu Jahl asked him, don’t you wish that Muhammad be in your place? The Sahaabi replied, ‘I am fully aware of my condition. If I die, my wife will be a widow, my children will become orphans, I will be brutally killed inspite of being in this condition and this frame of mind I cannot bear even hearing that a thorn has pricked the mubaarak feet of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. The pain of the thorn pricking Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] is more severe to me than the spear wounding my entire body.\n\nIncident 2: A woman sacrificed her father, husband and three sons in a battle. They all became Shaheed. She was informed about each one of them. Upon hearing the news of the death of all her beloved ones, She replied, ‘Innaa lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raaji’oon’ but would ask about Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. When she finally seen Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], she said, ‘O Prophet of Allah, every difficulty after seeing you is easy.’\n\nThe books of history are replete with such expressions of love. The second type of love is an inculcative one. One may love a person because of his outward experience, his character or his favours. Each one of these is fully found in the personality of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. This brief forum does not allow us to discuss all this in detail. The most effective way of inculcating the love for Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] is to obtain authentic literature about Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and study his life. When one understands the lifestyle of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and his mission, then one will truly appreciate Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and his great position. That will help build love and the expressions of love will naturally die.\n\n4. Your question is not clear.\n\n5. Refer to 3 above.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
