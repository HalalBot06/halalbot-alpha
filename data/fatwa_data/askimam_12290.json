  "question": "What is the Correct way of GhusalFriday & Rakat, Friday Afternoon , Ghusal After Intercourse,& what AIyat to say while Performing Ghusal & its Name. Pls Guide.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJumu?ah Salaat is Fardh and more emphasis has been laid on it by Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam]. There is no Dhuhr Salaat on a Friday. The Jumu?ah Salaat has been fixed in place of Dhuhr Salaat and is Fardh on all free, major, sane, healthy and Muqeem men.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is Sunnat to make a normal Ghusl (bath) on Friday before going for Salaat. Since the Ghusl has so many virtues for anyone who attend Jumu?ah prayer, if the Ghusl is taken after Salaat then it will have no virtue. The Jumu?ah Salaat has got 2 Fardh Rakaats which are performed in congregation. Before the Khutbah, there are 4 Rakaats Sunnat-e-Muakkadah, and 6 Rakaats after the Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0AProcedure for Ghusl%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Pour water over your right shoulder thrice;%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Pour water over your head thrice;%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Pour water over your left shoulder thrice;%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Make sure no part of the body or hair remains dry;%0D%0A%0D%0A5.
