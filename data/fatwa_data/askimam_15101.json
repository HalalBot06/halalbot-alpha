Please enlighten me on this issue.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n \n\n1.\n\nThe profession of Radio Jockey where you have to play music is not permissible in Shariah.\n\nAllah says in the Holy Qur’an:\n\nوَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يَشْتَرِي لَهْوَ الْحَدِيثِ لِيُضِلَّ عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَيَتَّخِذَهَا هُزُوًا أُولَئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُهِينٌ (لقمان:6)\n\nThere are those amongst men who purchase vain speech without knowledge, to mislead from the Path of Allah and throw ridicule on (the Path). For them there is a humiliating chastisement.(Luqmân : 6 ( \n\nIbn Kathir in his commentary of the Holy Qur’an writes under this ayah that three eminent Sahabah Abdullah bin Mas’ood, Abdullah bin Abbas, and Jabir bin Abdullah refer vain speech to mean singing.  The same explanation is stated by Ikrimah, Sa’eed bin Jubair, Mujahid, Makhool, Amar bin Shu’aib, and Ali bin Buzhaimah.\n\nHasan al-Basri says, “This ayah was revealed pertaining to singing and musical instruments.”\n\n(Tafsir ibn Kathir v.3 p.413 Dar al-Mufeed) \n\nImam Bukhari in his Sahih narrates:\n\nأبو عامر أو أبو مالك الأشعري والله ما كذبني سمع النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول ليكونن من أمتي أقوام  \n\nيستحلون الحر والحرير والخمر والمعازف (صحيح البخارى 6:303)\n\nThere will be people from my Ummah who will seek to make lawful fornication, wearing of silk, wine and the use of musical instruments (Sahih al-Bukhari 6:303 Dar al-Fikr)\n\nTo earn a living is compulsory and a necessity of life. However, the commands of Allah cannot be broken to fulfill this requirement.  One must try to look for work in which the commandments of Shariah are not broken.  Since the earning of this job is unlawful it will have a definite effect on one’s Akhirah.  To harm the eternal life of hereafter for the short life of this world will be foolish.\n\n2.\n\nAs an employee it is obligatory upon you to complete the work appointed to you and fulfill its requirement.  However, it is not permissible to break a commandment of Allah to fulfill this duty.  Salah is the foremost command of Allah and compulsory upon every believer.  It is unlawful and a grave sin to miss Salah for the reason of work.  Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) has said:\n\n عن نوفل بن معاوية الديلي قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم من فاتته الصلوة فكأنما وتر أهله وماله (صحيح ابن حبان و مسند احمد و شعب الايمان للبيهقى)\n\nNaufil bin Muawiyah (Radhiyallahu Anhu) narrates that he heard Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) saying, “A person who has missed one Salaat is like one who has lost his family and wealth.”\n \n\n You should try to take out few minutes out from your schedule and pray the Salah on its stipulated time.  If the work does not allow you to pray your Salah then such work will not be permissible.  You should try to look for another job which allows you to pray your Salah. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
