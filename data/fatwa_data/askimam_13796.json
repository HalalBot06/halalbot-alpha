  "answer": "QUESTION\nmy wife is pregnant, but she has a slight problem because she bleed even while she pregnant. doctors have told us that this is common but we should be careful, which means no sex. its alittle difficult for me because im still a male what should i do to satisfy my desires.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nConsider the difficulty your wife is experiencing during pregnancy. She is carrying your child which is an average of 1kg throughout the 40 weeks pregnancy period.\n\nThat is 6720 minutes. Would you carry 1kg continuously for so long? She also experiences many other complications â€“ back pain, nausea, etc. Compare your little difficulty with her enormous difficulties and pains. That may help suppress your desires. Nevertheless, you could derive pleasure from your wife in other ways besides intercourse.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
