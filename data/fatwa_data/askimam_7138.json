  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Can the dawah people who cannot concentrate daily taraweeh of 1 1/4 para in one mosque pray five parah of Quran daily. So that they finish atleast 1 Quran in Ramazan. 2. Can zakat be given in madarsah where our orfan brothers and sisters learn quran. If yes to whom we must give priority Madarsah or poor people or poor relatives. 3. I stay and work away from my home country. I cut short my expenses and send money to my Parents and they do lot of sadqa by helping poor and needy. Do i still have to pay zakat separately?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It would be better for them to read 5 Juz daily, so that they can be sure to complete, at least, one Qur?aan.\n\n2. Zakaat may be given to any reliable Madrasah who are known to use it correctly according to the rules of Shari?ah. Poor relatives get first preference, then the Madrasahs and then other poor people.\n\n3. Yes, you have to pay Zakaat separately on your personal assets.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT"
