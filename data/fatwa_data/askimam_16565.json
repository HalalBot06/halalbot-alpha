  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am revert to Islam for over two years Alhamdulillah, I did not know I women were not allowed to cut their hairs. However I do understand Allah (SWT) will not hold me responsible for what I did not know. I have few questions now in reference to my hair and hairs of my daughters.\n1. My oldest daughter has often split ends with long hairs. Periodically I trim her hairs to prevent breakage (more less than half inch). Is the acceptable because my only concern/intention is to maintain her hairs? We both love long hairs and it is not desirable to cut for style just for healthy hair.\n2. Youngest daughter has hairs that grow long but uneven drastically. Right side is over three feet and left side can differ by 5 or so inches at times (Right side grows very fast). So I have in past cut hairs to make somewhat even, is this acceptable?\n3. Lastly is multiple questions and is most sad and unfortunate for me and my hairs. I have extremely low iron and some health problems. My hairs began thinning and falling out, and doctor said is was due to my lack of iron and has put me on iron supplements after blood transfusion to save my life. I was devastated seeing my hairs come out every morning after washing and every time I brushed hairs. So I made mind to cut them and start fresh (prior to knowing I should not cut my hairs), I cut them size of man because some places of my hair got as low as man (1 inch). I hate it and I look like man style and I am dying inside! It has been two months now and hairs are only about 2 inches or so and growing very slowly. I hate to look at myself and pray Allah (SWT) to help hairs grow back healthy and to help my health to maintain my hairs. Okay so my questions are:\n\nA) Is it okay if I wear hair weaves (fake hairs)?\nB) If my health does not allow for me to grow hairs properly, is it okay for me to wear hair weaves?\nC) I feel so less of woman and I cry too much when looking in mirror and I feel big embarrassment for husband and don’t wish to show him my hair ever. Is this acceptable behavior?\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1.It is permissible to trim the split ends of her hair. (Aap-key Masail, vol. 7 pg. 128)\n\n2.If your youngest daughter is a minor, it will be permissible to cut her hair. If she is mature and her hair is extremely long to the extent that it reaches below her waist, it will be permissible to trim the left side of her hair to straighten it. However, if her hair is not so long then it will not be permissible to cut her longer hair. (Fatawa Rahimiyah, vol. 10 pg.120)\n\n3.It will be permissible for you to use synthetic hair weaves or any other material such as animal hair. It will not be permissible to use human hair in the weave. (Al-Bada'i al-Sana'I, vol. 4 pg. 302, Dar al-Kutub Deoband)\n\nIn regards to your depressed state due to your hair condition, it is only natural for you to feel this way. Hair was created by Allah Ta'ala as a means of beautification therefore; it is normal and acceptable for you to feel depressed due to your condition. However, you should use this incident to ponder over the millions of other bounties that Allah Ta'ala has bestowed upon you and has not taken it away from you. Thousands of other people do not enjoy the bounty of sight, hearing, speech, walking etc whilst you do. Everyone is tested and tried to some extent by Allah Ta'ala. The successful servants are those who praise Allah for His bounties and practice patience upon their difficulties. In this manner, you will be rewarded for both the praises and patience. Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم has stated, \"The matter of a believer is peculiar, every affair of his is good and this is for no one else besides a believer. If good befalls him, he is grateful and that is good for him. If calamity afflicts him, he is patient and that is good for him.\" (Muslim)\n\nعجبا لأمر المؤمن إن أمره كله خير وليس ذاك لأحد إلا للمؤمن إن أصابته سراء شكر فكان خيرا له وإن أصابته ضراء صبر فكان خيرا له\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
