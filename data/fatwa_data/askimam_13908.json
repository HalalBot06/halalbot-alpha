  "question": "If the imam has started Fajr salaat, do I join the imam, or do I first read the 2 sunnat rakaats.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1)  If the imam has started Fajr  salaat, do I join the imam, or do I first read the 2 sunnat rakaats.\n\n2)  What do you read in the DUA when a muslim dies.\n\n3) Could you recommend me a good book in English on Tawheed. \n\n4)  Did the prophet (PBUH) see Allah when he went on Meraj ? What is the view of Ahle-Sunnat-Wal-Jamaat.\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1) The Sunnah Salaah of Fajr is the most virtuous Sunnah Salaah. Rasulullah () is reported to have said the two rakaats Sunnah of Fajr is better than the whole world and whatever it contains. In another narration Rasulullah () said \"do not leave the Sunnah of Fajr, even though the horses trample upon you\". In view of these Ahadith it is important that an effort is made to perform the Sunnah of Fajr.\n\nNevertheless, if the imam has begun with the Fardh Salaah there are two possible situations a Muqtadi (follower) will be face:\n\nA) Confident in joining the Imam before salaam\n\nB) Not confident in joining the Imam before salaam\n\nIf the Muqtadi is confident that if by performing the Sunnah of fajr, he will still join the imam before salaam, he should perform the Sunnah of fajr. However, if the Muqtadi is in doubt or is not confident on joining the imam before salaam, he should not perform the Sunnah but join the Fardh Salaah.\n\nThere is no Qadha for the Sunnats of Fajr if the Fardh has been performed.\n\n2) When somebody dies one should recite \"Inna lilaahi wa inna ilayhi raajioon\"( to Allah do we belong and to Him do we return). Umme Salamah reports that the following should also be recited \"Allahuma ajirniy fi musibati wakhlufni khairan minhu\"-(oh! Allah reward me in my calamity and grant me something better)\n\n3) An excellent book on Tawheed in English is a book titled \"Imam Abu Hanifa’s Al Fiqhul Akbar with Maghnisawi’s Commentary\" translated and edited by Abdur Rahman ibn Yusuf. You may also obtain the English version of Aqeeda At Tahawiyya. These books are available from White Thread Press in the United States. This is their website address www.whitethreadpress.com\n\n4) There is a difference of the sahabha on this issue. Some opine that Nabi did see Allah and some say he did not see. Both groups have substantiated their views. This is not an issue that we will be questioned on the day of Qiyamah. There is a principle \"Conceal what Allah has concealed\".\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
