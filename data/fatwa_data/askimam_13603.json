  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. if someone, while fasting, touches the private parts and kisses a girl (which is not his wife- Intercource is not made), what would happen to Sawm? would it break? what would be penality.. should he have to fast for only one day (Quda) or for whole 60 days (Penality)? 2. On what value of shares zakat has to be paid.....on purchase price or market value on a partiuclar date (an oil & gas exploratipon company shares).\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAt the outset it is important to understand that it is prohibited to touch a non mahram female. Kissing is far more severe than that. Remember you are in the month of ramadaan and it does behove a muslim to be involved in Haraam acts. Just as the rewards are multiplied in this month, the punishments for sins are also multiplied. Therefore make sincere tawbah for your wrongs in this blessed month and stop having any contact with strange women. If you have reached a marriageable age ,you should marry. Marriage will protect you from falling into Haraam relationships and will also protect your chastity and Imaan.\n\nKissing does not nullify the fast.\n\nZakaat will be given according to the market price of the share.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
