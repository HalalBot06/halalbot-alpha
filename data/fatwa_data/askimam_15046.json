  "question": "Is hypnotherapy allowed in Islam? How to achieve Tawakkul?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs salaam u alykum respected mufti saab.Hope this finds you in the best of health.\n\nTwo questions.....\n\n1.Just wanted to ask some advice on tawakul. How best to achieve this? Especially when one has been tested by Allah. Like how best does one get over a death in the family etc?? How does one completely accept this and move on from it? Basically, how best to achieve this quality of complete tawakkul in Allah? Is it confirmed that Allah wont test man more than he can handle?\n\n2.Is hypnotherapy allowed in islam? I know a brother that has undergone hynotherapy from a pious muslim to overcome smoking.From what this brother advised me,is that it is allowed.But only to be done by an Allah fearing muslim.A thing like smoking seems to be \"all in the mind\" so to speak. I once heard in honourable Moulana Abdul Hamid's majlis programme in darul uloom azadville where he mentioned to strengthen the heart,one should eat one nice fresh apple everyday among other things ofcourse. What can one do to strengthen the mind??Physically and spirutually?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh.\n\n1) Firstly, it is compulsory for each and every muslim to believe in death. Each and every person has to face death, and death will come in its destined time and place. Allah Ta’ala says in the Quran:\n\nكل نفس ذائقة الموت وإنما توفون أجوركم يوم القيامة فمن زحزح عن النار وأدخل الجنة فقد فاز وما الحياة الدنيا إلا متاع الغرور \n\nEvery soul has to face death. And it is on the Doomsday that you will be paid for your reward in full. So, whoever has been kept away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise, he has really succeeded. And the worldly life is nothing but an asset, full of illusions. (Verse: 3:185)\n\nAllah Ta’ala mentions in another place:\n\nأينما تكونوا يدرككم الموت ولو كنتم في بروج مشيدة \n\nWherever you will be, death will overtake you, even though you are in fortified castles. (Verse: 4:78)\n\n \n\nSecondly, Allah Ta’ala has made this world a test ground for the believers; and Allah Ta’ala puts them through trials and tribulations so that they could be rewarded abundantly in the hereafter.\n\nWhen the companions of Nabi (Sallalllahu Alaihi Wasallam) were tormented by the infidels of Makkah, they came to Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam). At this point Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) reminded them of the trials the former Prophets and their followers had to go through. The following verse of the Quran was also revealed under this background.\n\nأحسب الناس أن يتركوا أن يقولوا آمنا وهم لا يفتنون \n\nDo people think that they will be left (at ease) only on their saying “We believe” and will not be put to test? (Verse: 29:2)\n\nUnder the explanation of this verse in Mariful Quran, Mufti Shafee (RA) says: \n\n“Although the background under which this verse was revealed, according to many narrations, was the harassment faced by the companions of Nabi (SAW) from the infidels at the time of Hijrah, but otherwise its message is common to all times. The pious, saints and scholars will also face the trials and tribulations in all times” (Qurtubi).\n\n \n\nThereafter, the believers are encouraged to exercise patience in calamities and hardships. Alaah Ta’ala states in the Quran:\n\nوبشر الصابرين  *  الذين إذا أصابتهم مصيبة قالوا إنا لله وإنا إليه راجعون\n\nAnd give good tidings to the patient who, when suffering comes to them, say: “We certainly belong to Allah and to him we are bound to return. (Verse: 2:155/6)\n\nMoreover one should complain about his hardships only to Allah, and ask him to grant the strength to overcome it. It is mentioned in the Quran that when Yaqoob (AS) lost both his sons, he said:\n\nإنما أشكو بثي وحزني إلى الله\nI complain of my anguish and sorrow to none but Allah.\n \n\nTherefore, it is advisable that you exercise patience to the best of your ability and remind yourself at all times that everything is the creation of Allah, and Allah can give life and death to His creation whenever He wants. You should also make dua to Allah Ta’ala that He gives you strength to overcome this grief.\n\n \n\n2) Hypnotherapy is neither encouraged nor discouraged in Islam. If it is used in the right context, it will be permissible. On the other hand, if it is used for evil purposes, then it will be impermissible.\n\nWe are unaware of how one could strengthen his mind physically.\n\nHowever, one can strengthen his mind spiritually by refraining from sins and avoid looking at those things that the Islam has prohibited. One should also avoid looking at his own private parts and his faeces.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nM.
