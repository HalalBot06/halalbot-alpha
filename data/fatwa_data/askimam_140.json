  "question": "What is the latest permissible time that one can perform Asr salaat, and how close to sunrise can one perform Fajr?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have been told that provided 2 rakaats of the Asr salaat have been completed before the Maghrib azaan commences, one can complete the Asr salaat and it will be valid.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe time for Asr Salaat is divided into two, Mustahabb (preferable) and Makrooh (reprehensible).\n\nThe Mustahabb time for Asr Salaat is until the sun is so bright that it is difficult to set one?s gaze on the sun, the eyes will dazzle. The Makrooh time commences upon the sun losing that brightness. Asr Salaat can be performed until sunset. Fajr Salaat can be performed until before sunrise.\n\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
