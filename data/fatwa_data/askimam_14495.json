  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know what is the fatwa regarding the folding of the pants during namaaz.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe pants of a male should be above the ankles at all times. There are severe warnings mentioned in the Ahaadith regarding those men who allow their trousers to fall below their ankles.\n\nIt is mentioned in one Hadith that Allah Ta’ala will not even cast a glance of mercy of the day of Qiyaamat towards that person who allows his trousers to fall below his ankles. (Muslim Hadith290). In another Hadith, it is mentioned that whatever clothing falls below the ankles, that portion will be in the fire of hell. (Bukhari Hadith5787)\n\nIt is mentioned in another Hadith that Allah does not accept the Salaat of that person whose trousers is below his ankles. From the above mentioned narrations, we learn the severity of the sin of letting one’s garments reach below the ankles, one should ensure at all times that his pants is above his ankles. If the trousers is so long that it reaches below one’s ankles, it should be folded, especially at the time time of Salaat, for Allah Ta’ala does not accept the Salaat of that person whose trousers is below his ankles.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
