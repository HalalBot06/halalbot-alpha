  "answer": "QUESTION\nI've been in a grave pain for the past 6 years.And my husband is the one causing this pain & problems. He insults me & my children (which are all grown up), doesn't respect us, doesn't let me see my family or talk to them,fight alot with us.Everything is miserable beause of him. I keep quiet and keep patients for which he takes advantage of. My sons pay for everything;the rent,food,insurance...He works but does not spend a single penny towards us or for the upbringing of the house(which is a father's duty). He insults me & my family alot & sometimes he don't speak to us for days or even months It's unbearable. I've done everything (used Allah's name to make him alright,have read some verses from Quran,but no luck). He don't listen to anyone & no one can dare talk to him.Please advice what I can do or read to make him alright again. You're my last hope!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Perform 2 Rakaats of Salaatul Haajat and beg Allah to deliver you from\nthis predicament.\n2. Whenever he comes home, recite 'Yaa Hayyu, Yaa Qayyoom, Yaa Ghaffooru,\nYaa Wadood' silently and blow upon him.\n3. Continue with your good conduct towards him even if he is abusive towards\nyou.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
