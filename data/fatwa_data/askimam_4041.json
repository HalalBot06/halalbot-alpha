  "question": "Salaam Mufti I am enquiring regarding the rights of a daughter to visit her parents home.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe have a situation where a son-in-law keeps no contact with his in-laws and prohibits them from visiting . When he does allow her to visit he merely drops her off and drives away . Please assist . Was Salaam Hassen\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA wife can visit her parents home once a week if they are unable to visit\nher. The husband cannot prohibit his in-laws from visiting his wife once a\nweek. (Shaami - Pg 602 vol,3)\n\nThe son-in-law should humble himself and visit his in-laws. His present\nstubborn behaviour will only worsen his relationship with them.\nConsequently, it is highly possible that this attitude will gradually affect\nhis relationship with his own wife. He should therefore \"break the ice\" now\nand show some affection towards his in-laws.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
