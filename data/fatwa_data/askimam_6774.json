  "question": "1. Is applying bleach on the face haraam? 2. Whats the meaning of the name Imran? 3. Is it haraam to shave one's beard?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Bleach will be permissible if it doesn?t cause harm to the skin.\n\n2. Imran comes from the word Amara which means long life or thriving.\n\n3. It is not permissible to shave the beard. The beard is one of the salient features of a Muslim. The person who shaves his beard is considered a Faasiq (open sinner) and his word will not be accepted in an Islamic court. It is also not permissible to appoint such a person as an Imaam. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has, ?Lengthen the beard and trim the moustache.?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
