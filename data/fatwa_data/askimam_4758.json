  "question": "what should be the aqeedah of Ahle sunnah about Yazeed ibn Muaavia (R.A)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\na friend of mine has name Yazeed ul hasan and he insists that yazeed is jannatee being amir of the lashkar which conquered qastuntunia.(he quoted a hadees from baab i jihaad of Bukhaari). is it true?should my friend change his name or not. is it jaaiz to say (RA) after taking yazeed's name? or is it jaaiz to curse him? Please guide us..jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAqeedah (beliefs) are regarding those matters mentioned in the Qur'aan and%0D%0AAhaadith. Since Yazeed is not mentioned in the Qur'aan, nor in the Ahaadith,%0D%0Awe are not required to have any Aqeedah regarding him. Insha Allah, we will%0D%0Anot be questioned about him on the day of Qiyaamat.%0D%0A%0D%0AYour friend does not have to change his name. To say that a person is a%0D%0AJannati requires sound proof. There is no proof to state that Yazeed is a%0D%0AJannati. We, thus, leave his affair to Allah Ta'ala.%0D%0A%0D%0AMerely being an Ameer of the army is not sufficient for a person to be a%0D%0AJannati. Only Allah Ta'ala knows who he has accepted to be a Jannati. For us%0D%0Ato say that a person is a Jannati, we have to have some Aayaat or Hadith to%0D%0Asupport this. There is no such Hadith regarding Yazeed, hence, we adopt%0D%0Asilence.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe term, 'Radhiallaahu Anhu' is generally used for the Sabaaha. Since%0D%0AYazeed was not a Sahaabi, this term should not be used. However, if somebody%0D%0Adoes ut it, it will not be sinful. As far as cursing Yazeed, what benefit is%0D%0Athere in it? It is neither Fardh, Waajib, Sunnah or even Mustahabb to curse%0D%0Ahim. If on the other hand he is not worthy of this curse, the curse will%0D%0Areturn to the one cursing. Thus, the issue of cursing requires absolute%0D%0Aprecaution. The method of our senior Ulama is to abstain from cursing him.%0D%0A(Fataawa Mahmoodiya vol.20 pg.77; Fataawa Rashidiyya pg.76)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
