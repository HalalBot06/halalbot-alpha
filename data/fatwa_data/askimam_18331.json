  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSalam...\n\nI had just given birth to my 3rd child. After my nifaas, I had the contraception-IUCD, inserted. Right after the insertion, I was bleeding & then was spotting for 2 days. The blood stopped for abt 3 days & I am spotting again after that.  After reading the IUCD guide, it was stated that, the spotting will go on for abt 3 mths. My questions is :-\n\n1) Do I need to perform the ghusl after every bleeding/spotting period?\n\n2) What kind of blood is this? If the blood is not haidh, do I still need to perform my prayers? Since I'm unsure if it's haidh. I am still performing my prayers. My reassure me on this question since I wouldn't want to do anything haraam like praying when I'm in haidh.\n\nJazakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nTo make the answer simpler, can you please let us know how many days you had the nifaas for and how many days after the nifaas did you start bleeding again?\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\n\n\nMl.
