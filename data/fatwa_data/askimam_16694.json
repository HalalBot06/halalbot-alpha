  "question": "I would like to know the evidences for 2 adhaans for Jumaah prayer?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know the evidences for 2 adhaans for Jumaah prayer. I know that Uthman radiallahu anho came up with the 2nd adhaan. I fully believe in this but many people are sceptical and say that we should revert back to the one adhaan. What response should we give and is the ruling found in any fatwa book?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nEvidence for the added adhan of Jumu'ah during the time of Uthman (RadiyAllahu Anhu) can be found in Sahih al-Bukhari:\n\n \n\nعن السائب بن يزيد قال كان النداء يوم الجمعة أوله إذا جلس الإمام على المنبر على عهد النبى - صلى الله عليه وسلم - وأبى بكر وعمر - رضى الله عنهما - فلما كان عثمان - رضى الله عنه - وكثر الناس زاد النداء الثالث على الزوراء.....قال أبو عبد الله: الزوراء موضع با لسوق با لمدينة.\n\n \n\n\"Saaib ibn Yazeed (RadiyAllahu Anhu) said that the first call for jumua'h in the time of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam), Abu Bakr, and Umar (RadiyAllahu Anhuma) was when the Imam sat on the pulpit. In the time of Uthman (RadiyAllahu Anhu) when there were many more people, he added a third call at the zawraa (the place of the market in Madinah).\" (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 1, P. 124, Qadimi)\n\n \n\nA similar Hadith is also narrated in Sunan Abi Dawud.\n\n \n\nIt is important to note that the narrator of the Hadith included the iqamah as a \"call\", which is why it is said that a third \"call\" was added.\n\n \n\nWe must remember that the Sahaba (RadiyAllahu Anhum) were the companions of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). They were with Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) day and night and their understanding of the Shari'ah was based on his teachings. They loved Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) more than they loved themselves. Allah Ta'ala made them examples and role models for the Ummah. Those who follow the example of the Sahaba (RadiyAllahu Anhum) will be guided on the straight path while those who do not follow their example will be deviated from the straight path. It is a command of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) himself that we must follow their sunnah. It is said in a Hadith:\n\n \n\nعليكم بسنتي وسنة الخلفاء الراشدين المهديين عضوا عليها بالنواجذ\n\n \n\n\"Upon you is my sunnah and the sunnah of the guided Khulafaa Raashideen. Hold firmly onto it.\" (Ibn Majah, Ahmed, Bayhaqee)\n\n \n\nIbn Mas'ud (RadiyAllahu Anhu) says:\n\n \n\nمن كان مستنا فليستن بمن قد مات فان الحى لا تؤمن عليه الفتنة اوليك اصحاب محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم كانوا افضل هذه الامة ابرها قلوبا واعمقها علما واقلها تكلفا اختارهم الله لصحبة نبيه ولاقامة دينه فاعرفوا لهم فضلهم واتبعواهم على اثرهم وتمسكوا بما استطعتم من اخلاقهم وسيرهم فانهم كانوا على الهدى المستقيم (رواه رزين كذا فى مشكوة المصابيح)\n\n\"Whosoever is going to adopt a way, they should adopt the way of those that passed away from this world.  For verily those that are alive are not saved from fitna.  They (those that passed) are the Companions of Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam).  They are the most noble from this Ummah.  They were the most pure from the heart, deep in knowledge, and less in formalities.  Allah chose them for the companionship of his Nabi (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) and for the upliftt of his Deen.  So recognize their status and follow their footsteps.  And inculcate in you their character and lifestyle to the best of your abilities.  They were on the straight guidance.\" (Razeen as mentioned in Mishkat Al-Masabeeh)\n\nThe abovementioned Hadith clearly indicate that we must follow the Sahaba (RadiyAllahu Anhum).\n\nDuring the time of the Khulafaa al-Raashideen, there were issues that arose which weren't present during the time of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). The Khulafaa al-Raashideen introduced these issues to the Ummah after understanding their importance. For example, the compilation of the Quran into one book was done after the time of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). Umar (RadiyAllahu Anhu) introduced praying salat-ul-taraweeh in Ramadan in congregation because there was no fear of it becoming fard. Likewise, when the city of Madinah grew and the boundaries spread, there was a need for an additional adhan for Jumu'ah to call people from their works so that they may come on time to the masjid for the Khutbah. This was introduced by Uthman (RadiyAllahu Anhu) who was Khalifa at the time. All of these rulings were agreed upon by the Sahaba (RadiyAllahu Anhum) with ijmaa' (consensus) by their approval or silence. They surely would have disapproved anything that Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) would have disapproved.\n\nTherefore, it is compulsory on us to follow the way of the Sahaba (RadiyAllahu Anhum). This was a direct command of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) as mentioned in the Hadith above. And following the command of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) is following the orders of Allah Ta'ala as is said in the Quran:\n\n. من يطع الرسول فقد أطاع الله\n\n\"He who obeys the Messenger has surely obeyed Allah\" (4:80)\n\nTherefore, whoever denies these rulings has disobeyed the direct orders of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) which is also disobeying Allah Ta'ala.\n\nMay Allah give us the strength to follow the Sunnah of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) and the Sahaba (RadiyAllahu Anhum).\n\n(Fatawa Mahmudiyya, Vol. 8, P. 297-300, Faruqiyya)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
