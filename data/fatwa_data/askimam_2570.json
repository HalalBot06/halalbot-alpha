  "question": "Is it more rewarding for us (females) to follow our father in salaat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe live in a small town where there are no Masjids and practically no Muslims. My father goes for Jumaa prayers to a masjid that is 45 minutes away. But on regular days we make a jamaat to pray and he leads us. There are no males in our family except for him. Would it be more rewarding for us (females) to follow my father or for us to read our own indivisual prayers? Jazakallah khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nIf there are other Muslim men in the area, they should be consulted to\nperform five times Salaat with Jamaah. However, in the meanwhile, due to the\ncircumstances mentioned in the query, it will be permissible for your\nfemales to follow your father in Jamaah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
