  "question": "Is this true? women who wear hijaab are allowed to do anything, as long as they have on the hijaab.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn my family, the women who wear hijaab are allowed to do anything, as long as they have on the hijaab. They can go to work ( even though they don't HAVE to as the father & brothers work), they don't need a wali to travel long distances locally or overseas, they can go to mixed gatherings, malls, school, college, university; late at night etc. Is it true that if you have on hijaab the other rules don't apply? What clothes are part of hijaab? is it dresses, skirts, jeans or does it mean outer cloak and head-scarf? does the hijaab protect you?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Donning the Hijaab does not permit one to commit any prohibited act in Shari?ah. Rather, the Hijaab should protect one more from such acts.\n\n2. It is compulsory for the woman to cover herself totally from head to toe in a decent way without any clothes being transparent, tight-fitting and resembling the clothes of the Kuffaar.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
