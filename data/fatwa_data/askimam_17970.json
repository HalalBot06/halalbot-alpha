  "question": "Money earned from a bank",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy wife was working in a bank few years back. During that time we purchased a land in India.\n\nWhen  I did a mashura with two aalims, they said the money erned by working in a bank is not halal, so it has to be distributed to poeple who are in great misery or immersed in\nliablities. So we did accordingly and finished all the money.\n\nNow only this land is remaining. Please let me know whether the money invested at that time has to be given out or the existing appreciated value of the land has to be given out.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nIn order for us to answer your query, please clarify the following:\n\nWhat were your wife's responsibilities in the bank?\nWas the land purchased jointly or with your wife's money only?\nIf it was bought solely with your wife's money, then did she only have money from her employment in the bank or did she have money from other halāl sources, too, which was used in the purchase?\n\n                                                              i.      If she had money from other halāl sources, as well, then what percentage of the land's cost was the money from other sources?\n\nWas a loan taken to purchase the land?\nIf a loan was taken, then what percentage of the land's price was paid from the loan?\n\n \n\nIt is important for us to have answers to these questions in order to answer your query.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
