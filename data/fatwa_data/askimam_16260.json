  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nTell me the belief of  \" Nazr \" we muslims have eman that if we didnt say \"MASHALLAH\" our eye has a power to demolish buildings, to make someone ill, to stop or make bad the good work of someone. My question is that if eye has this much power so what is Allah doing. If someone forget to say MASHALLAH then his eye can make things wrong without Allah order.\n\nI was very dishearted when my friend come from two day holiday and said that i was ill due to effected by NAZR he has not eman that Allah did this thing not NAZR. I have confusion and i think that this is great SHIRK.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is our aqeeda and belief that everything that happens in this world is with the order of Allag Taala. Nothing in this world occurs by itself. However, we are living in a world of means (Darul Asbab). If one is hungry, he has to adopt means to eat. If one is thirsty, he has to look for water. The food and water is not sent by Allah from the skies. In this condition, while we adopt means to eat and drink, we still believe that Allah gave us to eat and drink as Allah is the One who created the means for us to get he food and drink. Allah is Musabbihul Asbaab (the Creator of Means). Similarly, when a person gets sick, he goes to a physician who cures him. We believe, Allah put the effect in the means for him to be cured.\n\nNazar is haq and true, Rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wasallam) said, “The eye is Haq”. (Bukhari) Allah put effect in some eyes as He put effect in cold wind, black magic, poison etc. If one gets sick due to extreme cold, one cannot say why did the cold make him sick, what is Allah doing? If one dies through poison, one cannot say, why did the poison kill him, what is Allah doing? The effect in the cold and poison is by the order of Allah. If Allah wants, cold may not make a person cisk and poison may not kill.\n\nSimilarly, the effect of Nazar is by the order of Allah. If Allah wills, the Nazar will have and affect. The nazar itself does not have any powers. Therefore, the belief in Nazar is not Shirk, However, this does not mean that anything negative is the consequences of Nazar. a person who has the skill in this can point out whether that is Nazar or not.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
