  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaikum, My question is regarding the authenticity in the knowledge of Astrology, pamistry, optical telepathy and foretelling someone about one's future through the Quranic verses. Most of the learned people say that these are just beliefs upon which people strain pertinaciously but one thing that strikes my mind is the incident of the birth of Hazrat Musa A.S. The Pharaoh was foretold about Hazrat Musa's birth by his astrologers and magicians. He was told by them that the specific child would demolish his reign and tyrannical rule over the Bani Israel. And that's what happened. If these things are just baseless creeds then how can this incident bhi expounded? Some people have showed conviction in the truth lied in the knowledge of pamistry. They have even showed this. Moreover some people use Quranic verses to foretell the incidents of future which may occur with a person. However it goes without saying that ALLAH ALMIGHTY is the only one in this whole universe which knows the fate of every creation of HIS. But i want to know what is the reality behind these things? Are they completely baseless? If so, then what would u say about the prediction of Hazrat Musa's birth by Pharaoh's Astrologers? JazakAllah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nUndoubtedly, the complete and correct knowledge of the unseen and the future%0D%0Ais only known by Allah Ta'la but Allah Ta'la through His wisdom has kept%0D%0Aopen certain ways and methods for man to determine the unseen and future%0D%0Awhich sometimes turn out to be true but often untrue. Although Allah Ta'la%0D%0Ahas kept open these certain avenues for man, He has also made it haraam for%0D%0Aman to utilise these methods and ways to determine the future and unseen and%0D%0Ato beleive in it, thererfore, establishing this knowledge as a test for the%0D%0Ahearts of man.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is recorded in the books of Tafseer and Hadith that before the birth of%0D%0ANabi alaihis salaam the jinnaat and shayateen were granted free-flow access%0D%0Ato the skies so that whenever any command of Allah Ta'la was to be%0D%0Atransmitted via the Angels from the seventh heaven to the first heaven, the%0D%0AJinnaat would listen to the command of what was to occur on the earth and%0D%0Aspontaneously they would pass this knowledge on to there foretunteller,%0D%0Aastrologer or palmistry friends on the earth who would then foretel the%0D%0Adifferent occurrences to take place.%0D%0A%0D%0AAfter the blessed birth of Nabi alaihis salaam, Allah had destined that the%0D%0AJinnaat and shayateen would not be granted access to the skies and now%0D%0Awhenever they would try to listen to any order being passed-on by the Angels%0D%0Athey would be repelled instantly. Now, the jinnaat would climb on the backs%0D%0Aof each other and make a queue till the sky and the one at the top would%0D%0Ahide behind a star and listen like a thief to the order being transmitted%0D%0Aand almost instantly the Angel after noticing the jinnaat would kick the%0D%0Astar thereby burning the jinn. As soon as the first jinn would hear%0D%0Aanything, he would immediately whisper it to his companion below him and so%0D%0Aon till the fortunteller at the end would be informed of the future%0D%0Aoccurrences. Before this information could reach the last person, many lies%0D%0Awould have been mixed to the original message therefore the last person%0D%0Awould only receive one percent of truth and ninety nine of lies. This is%0D%0Aonly one of the methods which was and is still adopted to foresee the%0D%0Afuture.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllamah Ibn Hajar Asqalaani in his book, Fathul Bari, has mentioned four%0D%0Aways of how the unseen and future is interpreted. The above method is the%0D%0Afirst one and the other three are as follows: 2) Some people come to know of%0D%0Athe unseen via a jinn who befriends them and informs them of different%0D%0Aoccurrences and happenings regarding which man is unaware of OR 3) Through%0D%0Aconjecture, estimation and guess some people tell of the unseen. This is a%0D%0Atype of power which Allah Ta'ala grants an individual but many a times it%0D%0Aturns out to be false OR 4) By means of experience and understanding the%0D%0Ahabits and system of different things some people deduce of what is to occur%0D%0Ain the future . This last type is similiar to magic.%0D%0A%0D%0AAll the above methods adopted to foresee the future and to tell of the%0D%0Aunseen are reproachable and reprehensible.(Fathul Bari vol. 10 pg. 266,%0D%0AKitaab on Tibb, Chapter on Foretuntelling, Qadeemi Kutub Khana).%0D%0A%0D%0AIn no circumstances is it permissible to go to a foretuneteller or%0D%0Aastrologer. There are numerous Ahadith sounding prohibition from visiting a%0D%0Aforetuneteller. Nabi alaihis salaam said: He who visits a foretunteller, his%0D%0Asalaat will not be accepted for 40 days.%0D%0A%0D%0ACorncerning the person who recites Quraanic verses and foresees the future,%0D%0Awe cannot be specific and pass any verdict as to the methodology he adopts%0D%0Abut the above 4 methods are the common ones used.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
