  "question": "Why are the hands not raised before bowing, etc. in the Hanafi madhab, even if it is mentioned in the Hadith?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaikum. 1. My name is Saad Mahmud Kabir. Do I need to change my name, especially my last name? 2. Sahih Al-Bukhari Hadith, Vol 1, no. 706 - It is said that the Prophet (saw) used to raise his hands at the Takbir before bowing, on saying \"Samia-l-lahu Liman hamida\", and on rising from the second Rak'a (for the 3rd Rak'a). Why does the Hanafi Madhab not follow this rule? Please clear my confusion. 3. Where should hands be placed during Salat? This question was asked before, but the Hadith given was not Sahih Bukhari or Sahih Muslim. Could you please give me a Sahih hadith (of the two mentioned) about this? Jazak Allah, Wassalamualaikum.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We don?t see the need for you to change your name.\n\n2. The Hanafi Madhab takes into account other Ahaadith that do not make mention of raising the hands and the Hadith mentioned by you is considered abrogated by the Hanafis.\n\n3. There are many other authentic Ahaadith books besides Bukhari and Muslim. What gives you the notion that if something is not mentioned in Saheehayn, it is not authentic?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
