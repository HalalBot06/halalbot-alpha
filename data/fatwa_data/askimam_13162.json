  "question": "Apalled at Muslims who consume alcohol, etc.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI visited America recently and was appalled at the state of the Muslims there. They do not eat Halaal and are consuming alcohol. What is happening there ?\n\nPlease comment.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAt the outset, it is important to understand that we humans are created weak. Allah created us with desires. Therefore, with our weakness and desires, we are attracted to sin. Shaytaan has taken a pledge with Allah that he will try his utmost to lure us into sin. It is, therefore, not appropriate to look down upon those who sin and err. The sin should be condemned, not the sinner.\n\n \n\nAnalyse the conditions prior to the advent of Islam. The Quraysh of Makkah had reached such a level of social ethics that they were classified as barbarians and no government was prepared to rule them. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] made an effort upon them and they became heros and guiding stars of humanity. What was that effort? That was the effort of Imaan. He built their Imaan to such a level that they abhorred those sins which were part of their lives prior to Islam. It is for this reason that the temperament of Deen is not to practice Deen yourself, but together with your ibaadat, you encourage others with wisdom and diplomacy. To talk and condemn them will serve no good. In order to get a change, we will have to first change and encourage others. You should join the local effort and assist them. You will find change slowly, Insha Allah.\n\n \n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
