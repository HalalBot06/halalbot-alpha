  "question": "can i marry my wifes cousin? Is there anything in Shariah to suggest that a man cant marry any of his wifes relatives obviously excluding her sisters if she has any?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nShe is very virtuous & pious & I admire her much. I make duaa that I can marry her and complete a sunnah of the noble Prophet (saws) to marry more than once. I do know for sure that whoever marries her if Allah through His infinite Wisdom does not give her in marriage to me, is that she will make some other brother 'very happy'. Is it bad of me to have such a thought even though I want something which is halal? Is there anything in Shariah to suggest that a man cant marry any of his wifes relatives obviously excluding her sisters if she has any? Is it possible to have wives live in the same house as long as they have their own bedrooms but are treated fairly as regards clothing, food etc if they agree, or must they have totally separate space? Your advice & time in answering this question is much appreciated. May Allah Bless you....\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Why do you insist on this Sunnah? Remember, Shari'ah has not encouraged\npolygamy. It has merely condoned and permitted it. However, if you are bent\non marrying a second time, you may do so provided you are confident you will\nbe able to maintain equality.\n2. Separate bedrooms are not sufficient. They have to be kept separately as\nprivacy is essential. If they are both under one roof but living in\ndifferent rooms with separate ablution, toilet and kitchen facilities and\nseparate entrances, this is fine. The point is privacy and complete\nseparation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
