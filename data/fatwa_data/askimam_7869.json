  "answer": "QUESTION\nWala ta da lana fi maqamina haza thambien ila gafarta wala humnan ila farajta wala karban ila nafasta wala daynan ila qadayta wala nareedin ila shafaita wala dhaalin ila hadaita wala aseerin ila yasarta wala maytan ila rahiemta wala haajatan min ijit dunya wal ahkira\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHadhrat Abdullah ibn Awf (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Whosoever has a need from Allah as any other need from man, then he should make Wudhu properly then perform 2 Rakaats of Salaat and then praise Allah and send salutations upon Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and then recite:%0D%0A%0D%0ATranslit: Laa ilaaha illallaahul adheemul kareem, Subhaanallaahi rabbil arshil adheem wal hamdulillaahi rabbil aalameen, as-aluka muwjibaat rahmatika, wa azaaima maghfiratik, wal ghaneemat min kulli birri, wassalaamata min kulli ismi, laa tada?a liy dhanban illaa ghafaratah, walaa hamman illaa farrajtah, walaa haajatan hiya laka ridhwan illaa qadhaytahaa yaa arhamar raahimeen%0D%0ATrans: There is none worthy of worship besides Allah, the Clement, the Bountiful. Glory be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds. I beg of you the causes entailing your mercy, and the purpose of (securing) your pardon, gains from every righteousness and safeguard from every sin. Leave no sin of mine unforgiven, no anxiety unrelieved and no need (of mine) with which you are pleased, unfulfilled, O merciful of those who show mercy. (Mishkaat pg.117)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above is the exact words and translation as found in the Hadith. However, the meaning of the text as mentioned by you is ?and do not leave any sin this place except they be forgiven and not worries except that you remove them and no difficulties except that you clear the way and no debt except that you discharge it and no sickness except that you cure them and no misguided except that you guide them and no prisoner except that you free them and no dead except that you forgive them and no need of this world and Aakhirat ?%0D%0A%0D%0ANb. The text you have mentioned has some error, for e.g. ?walaa nareedin? should read ?walaa mareedhan?, ?Walaa humnan? should read, ?Walaa hamman?, ?Walaa haajata min ijit dunya?? should read ?Wala haajatan min hawaa-ijd dunyaa?? Also, the text is incomplete.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
