  "question": "What makes a hadith muttawatir and what makes a hadith Ahad, according to the hanafi opinion?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nScholars of Hadith have classified the Ahadith into two broad categories which are termed as Mutawatir and Ahad. Mutawatir Hadith is one which has been reported by a large number of narrators and therefore it is inconceivable that all of them could have lied.\n\nAs for the Ahad Hadith, the number of narrators are lesser than that of those reporting the Mutawatir Hadith. Kindly refer attached ? ?rejectors of Hadith?.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
