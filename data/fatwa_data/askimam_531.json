  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nUNBRIDGEABLE DIVIDE%0D%0A-------------------%0D%0A%0D%0AThe protracted contrariety between Islam and Shi'ism is but a clear%0D%0Areflection of fundamental differences between the two. The only common%0D%0Adenominator between Islam and Shi'ism is the Islamic Kalimah. The rest of%0D%0AShi'ism has very little in common with mainstream Islam. The unbridgeable%0D%0Adivide between the two is entrenched in some of the core fundamentals of%0D%0Athis sect, such as:%0D%0A%0D%0A* THE TWELVE IMAAMS%0D%0A%0D%0AImaamah is a divine station like Nubuwwat. This implies that Sunnis, who do%0D%0Anot believe in Imaamah, are unbelievers. According to their beliefs, Allah%0D%0Ahad chosen twelve men to succees Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). The%0D%0Atwelfth Imaam however disappeared at the age of five. He is believed to be%0D%0Athe awaited Mahdi.%0D%0A%0D%0A* THE STATUS OF THE IMAAMS%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Imaams possess more knowledge than the Ambiyaa. They are superior to the%0D%0AAmbiyaa and the entire creation. The Imaams can bring the dead back to life.%0D%0ANo knowledge of the heavens and the earth is hidden from them.%0D%0A%0D%0A* THE INTERPOLATION OF THE NOBLE QUR'AN%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Qur'an is incomplete and distorted in its present form. This tenet had%0D%0Abeen explicity propounded by the classical scholars of Shi'ism, but frugally%0D%0Adenied by the contemporary scholars.%0D%0A%0D%0A* VILIFICATION AND APOSTASY OF THE SAHAABA%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Sahaaba were guilty of wilfully distorting and corrupting the Deen of%0D%0AMuhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). They turned renegade after the%0D%0Ademise of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) except the immediate household%0D%0Aof Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0A%0A* THE PERMISSIBILITY OF MUT'A%0D%0A%0D%0A* VIRTUES OF TAQIYYA%0D%0A%0D%0AIslam and Shi'ism are two parallel streams of thought that can never%0D%0Aconverge. They are as distinct from each other, as is Islam to the%0D%0AAhlul-Kitaab.To ignore these differences is to ignore the stark reality.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe often repeated hallowed call for \"Muslim Unity\" simply serves as a%0D%0Asmokescreen, behind which Shi'a missionaries penetrate Muslim societies. Any%0D%0Aattempt to resist this imposition is branded as \"divisive\". Would it be%0D%0Adivisive to protect Islam from a sect that inherently debases the Qur'an,%0D%0Athe Ambiyaa, and the Sahaaba? Unity can only be forged on the basis of%0D%0AAqeedah (belief). To label these differences as 'hair splitting issues' is%0D%0Ato undermine the sanctity of the Qur'an, the Ambiyaa and the Sahaaba unity%0D%0Aat the cost of the Qur'an is tantamount to blasphemy.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe constitution of our country guarantees religious freedom. The Shi'as%0D%0Atherefore have the right to propagate their beliefs. However, they need to%0D%0Acome out of the closet and do so under the banner of Shi'ism.%0D%0A%0D%0AIssued by: UUCSA%0D%0A"
