  "question": "If someone charges something on my credit card promising that they will pay within the due date and they don't, will I be liable for the interest that I pay on their behalf",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThis question has been bothering me for a long time. If someone charges something on my credit card promising that they will pay within the due date to avoid interest(in this case, my family) and they don't, will I be personally liable for the nterest that I pay on their behalf. They make the payments and everything is theirs except that it's on my name. Will Allah punish ME for interest. I have explained to my family many many times but they always come up with excuses like, how will we survivie if we pay it all at once? 2) My dad just saw dream on laitul Qadr (27th night). The dream was as follows: There was a big ijtimah. Many many people were there. It seemed like it was at our godowns back in Pakistan. Someone said that Rasulullah(saw) has also come. After a while, it was confirmed which one was him. He(saw) had a big white beard, tall, perfect fit and he was wearing white clothes. Sometimes, it seemed like he had white feathers all over his body. Because of adaab, nobody went and dared to say salaams to him. Everyone was looking at him from far away. Can you interpret this dream. It's blessed but what exactlty does it mean?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In principle, it is Haraam (prohibited) to get involved in any interest bearing transaction. Therefore, to avoid the interest accruing on the account, you should advise your family to be vigilant and efficient with the payments. Educate them with regard to the serious implications of getting involved in interest so that they may pay the due amount within the required date.\n\n2. Alhamdulillah, that is a blessed dream.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
