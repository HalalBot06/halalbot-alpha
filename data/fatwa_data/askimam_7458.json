  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe understand that if a person is very old and cannot fast, he/she should give food to any one poor person twice a day. But if we have difficulty in giving food and want to pay the amount, how should we calculate the amount. Please also let me know in detail how to calculate Zakaat on property i.e. Car, House etc.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not necessary to give the actual food to the poor and needy as Fidyah. The cash amount equivalent to the amount of feeding a poor person may also be given as Fidyah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
