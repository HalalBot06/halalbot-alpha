  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissible for me to attend the Christian wedding in the church/hall?... since many of my co-workers are christian... I already attend few of the ceremony with the intention of friendship...\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIt is important to show good character to your Muslim and non Muslim co-workers and acquaintances as it is a means to present the beauty of Islam. However, to keep non Muslims as close friends or allies is against the law of the Shari̒a.\n\nAlmighty Allah says in the Holy Quran:\n\n\"Oh you who believe! Do not take the Christians and the Jews as allies. They are allies of each other. Whoever has taken them as allies is among them. Indeed Allah does not guide the wrongdoers.\"\n\n( Al Quran 5:51)\n\nAttending gatherings of the kuffār in churches etc. and participating in their ceremonies is tantamount to honouring their religion and resembling them in action.\n\nRegarding this, Rasulullah Sallallāhu ̒alaihi Wa Sallam has said:\n\n\"Whoever resembles a nation, then he is among them.\"[1]\n\n                                                                              (Abu Dāwud)\n\nTherefore, in principle it is not permissible to enter churches/church halls etc.[2]\n\n \n\nN.B.  In most, if not all ceremonies of non Muslim weddings there are mixed gatherings (of males and females), music, dancing and alcohol that is served. Therefore, to attend these weddings and ceremonies will be Impermissible.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl. Zakariyya bin Ahmed,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā\n\n\n\n\n[1] قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم من تشبه بقوم فهو منهم\n\n \n\n[2] وفي التتارخانية يكره للمسلم الدخول في البيعة والكنيسة ، وإنما يكره من حيث إنه مجمع الشياطين لا من حيث إنه ليس له حق الدخول ا هـ قال في البحر : والظاهر أنها تحريمية ؛ لأنها المرادة عند إطلاقهم.\n (رد المحتار,سعيد ,ج1,ص380)"
