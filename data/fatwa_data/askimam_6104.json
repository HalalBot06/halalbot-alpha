The marriage is invalid.%0D%0A2. Kindly refer below our standard reply on 'How to perform Nikah.'%0D%0A3. It is not permissible to have any premarital relationship with the girl.%0D%0AYou should terminate every contact with her until marriage.%0D%0A4. Marriage is a major step in one's life. It is important to seek the%0D%0Aadvice and guidance of your seniors in your marriage. Your seniors, parents,%0D%0Aetc. have experience and wisdom. They love you and know you. You should not%0D%0Ado anything behind their back. Explain them your feelings and what you wish%0D%0Ato do. They will advise you appropriately.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AA Nikah is performed with a proposal (Iejaab) by the male or female and%0D%0Aacceptance (Qubool) by the male or female in the past tense and in the%0D%0Apresence of two male Muslim witnesses (Hidaaya vol. 2).%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is Sunnat that the marriage be announced and performed in the Masjid and%0D%0Athe bride be represented by her Mahram (father, brother, etc.). The bride%0D%0Agives consent to her representative (Wakeel) in the presence of two%0D%0Awitnesses to perform her marriage at the Masjid. At the Masjid, the Wakeel%0D%0Arepresents the bride in the presence of the two witnesses and the stipulated%0D%0Adowry. The witnesses must be two trustworthy and pious male Muslims who are%0D%0Anot her ascendants e.g. father, grandfather or decendants e.g. son,%0D%0Agrandson, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Mahr (dowry) is the woman's right and should be stipulated prior to the%0D%0Amarriage.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe procedure of marriage via the internet is same as marriage by proxy%0D%0Awhere one of the partners (boy or girl) propose to marry the other. It is%0D%0Aadvisable that the proposal be written in front of two persons. However,%0D%0Athis is not a precondition. (Shaami vol.3 pg.12; HM Saeed)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe two witnesses should also sign the document be sent to the other party,%0D%0Afor example, in a foreign land and accept the written proposal in the%0D%0Apresence of two witnesses. The presence of these two witnesses is a%0D%0Apre-condition. It is important to exercise extreme precaution by verifying%0D%0Athe proposal and its witnessing to avoid any possibility of fraud and%0D%0Adeception."
