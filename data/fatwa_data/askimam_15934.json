  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI live in Pakistan and in this Ramadan I went with my family to perform Umrah. We began our fasts in Pakistan, however we celebrated Eid in Makkah. My question is that since there is a difference of dates between the 2 countries in starting and ending Ramadan, therfore I had observed only 28 fasts. I have now returned to Pakistan. The issue is there were 29 fasts in Saudi Arabia and 30 in Pakistan. Now what am I supposed to do. Complete 29 or 30 fasts? Keeping in mind that I returned after 15 Shawwal.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nYou are required to make qadha of only one fast. The minimum number of days in a month is 29; therefore, you are required to complete only 29 fasts in such a situation, regardless of how many fasts any of the countries had.\n\nFatawa Raheemiyah Vol.7 Pg.214 (Darul Ishaâ€™at)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
