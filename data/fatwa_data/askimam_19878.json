  "question": "Is it permissible for me to send kisses to a man over facebook?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a brother on Facebook. He is not my blood sibling but I from the depth of my heart think and accept him as my brother. He is to me, just like my own blood brother.\n\nThere are two problems, one he is a non-Muslim. I pray to Allah to show him the right path and the second problem is that we became so close to each other that we used to kiss each other on the forehead, face or nose(by saying only i.e. we used to write it in texting. We never met, but of course we meant that).\n\nI am suffering from mental depression and torture due to my mother and father always fighting with each other. He kind of gave me mental support. I feel relax when I talk to him. He never interfered in my religious activities rather he forced me to offer Salaat, keep Fasts and don Pardah etc. I want to ask seek an authentic answer for it, that is it really a sin to kiss on forehead or nose or hug such a brother? When my mother told me I told my brother (from fb) not to do so until I get an authentic answer from my religious teachings. Can anyone help me out of this confusion?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nWe are sorry to hear about the problems you currently face at home. We hope and pray that Allah Ta’ala assists you in persevering over these different challenges.\n\nSister as a Muslimah one of your most prized and valued possessions is your chastity. You should take pride in refraining from any type of connection with the opposite gender.\n\nWe understand that because of the different challenges you face at home you look for an outlet with which you could lessen your burden. It is something natural and to a certain degree understandable. But to go and speak to a strange (one who is not your Mahram) man is not the solution. Rather look for another Muslim sister who you can turn to and who would give you a listening ear.\n\nIt is incorrect of you to consider this man to be your brother. From the very inception your relationship with him was totally impermissible. To term him as your brother is only a ploy of Shaitan to trivialize the magnanimity of this sin. He is not your brother in any way. He is a total stranger. You should immediately cut all contact with this man and never speak to him again. Don’t feel guilty about totally abandoning all links with this man since this is in your best interest. By carrying your relationship with this person you are only earning sins for yourself in turn making life more difficult. Obey the commands of Allah and live within the laws of Allah Ta’ala, you will find that Allah Ta’ala will assist you in all of life’s challenges.\n\n\nWe ask Allah Ta’ala to guide us to the path of his righteous and faithful servants. Aameen\n\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Ali bin Cassim\nStudent Darul Iftaa\nLos Angeles, CA (USA)\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
