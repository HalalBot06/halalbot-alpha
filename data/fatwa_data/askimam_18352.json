  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI regularly encounter the following situation after waking up in the morning:\n\na) I can not see any traces of mani, wazi etc. in my wear\nb) I go to the bathroom and squeeze my sexual organ to ensure that really no liquid is stuck it\n\nThen, at the moment of squeezing there is often a single drop of liquid (I think it is wazi) which comes out.\n\nQuestion 1:\nIn the above-mentioned situation, will I have to do ghusl if I saw no erotic dream?\n\nQuestion 2:\nIn the above-mentioned situation, will I have to do ghusl if I actually saw an erotic dream?\n\nQuestion 3:\nWould it be ok for me to simply stop squeezing every morning and just going to toilet and ignoring this single drop? (This question applies to both cases: erotic dream and no erotic dream)\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nÂ \n\nAfter Analysing your query, it seems that you are suffering from Waswasa (Develish doubts) these are doubts from Shaitaan, you should overlook these doubts. There is no need to make Ghusal, By washing your private parts and making Wudhu would surfice.\n\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
