  "question": "Are decoration pieces made of Crystal or Marble allowed which depict different animals?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nFor example, a swan made of crystal? Also, are stuffed animals allowed to be kept in one's drawing room? People hunt these poor animals for fun and then stuff them to preserve them to show off to people. Would Salat be valid in a room with any of these objects?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Pictures and decorations depicting animate objects are not permissible immaterial of the substance it is made of. (Raddul Muhtaar vol.1 pg.647)\n\n2. It is not correct to keep stuffed animals. (Fatawa Mahmoodiyah vol.15 pg.345)\n\n3. It is Makrooh-e-Tahrimi to perform Salaat in a room containing pictures or decorations depicting animate objects. (Raddul Muhtaar vol.1 pg.648)\n\n4. It will be Waajib (necessary) to repeat such Salaat. However, if the picture is behind one?s back it will be Makrooh, but not as severe.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
