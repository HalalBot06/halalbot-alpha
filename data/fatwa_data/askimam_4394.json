  "question": "As-salaam-u-alaikum. My question concerns the practices in Salaat. It consists of numerous subquestions, therefore please read the details below. Jazakallahu-khair.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) Which is the correct way to count the Tasbeeh on your fingers? 2) When should you read Tasbeeh in Salaat (i.e. after the Fard or at the end)? 3) Do you have to say things in multiples of eleven (e.g. Alhamdullilah 33 times)? 4) I've noticed that people sometimes blow or kiss their fingers and rub their eyes 3 times when they complete the Tasbeeh. Is this bid'at? What should be done? 5) After the Fard salaat, the Imaam reads Fateha. Should he sit facing the Qiblah or turn towards the right when doing so? Should he read Tasbeeh before making fateha (Refer question 2)? 6) Finally, I've heard that it is Sunnah to rub the hands over the face when completing fateha. Should you also kiss your fingers when this action is completed?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (SAW) emphasised on reciting Tasbeeh-e-Fatima, Subhanallah,\nAlhamdolillah and Allahu-Akbar after each farz salaah. According to one\nnarration each of the three zikrs should be recited 33times and be completed\nby reciting the first kalima. That makes it 100. The zikr may be made\nimmediately after the farz salaah or after making dua.(Fateha). The numbers\nmay be counted in any way comfortable to an individual. There is no specific\nway to do so. The zikrs may be counted on the fingers or by using tasbeeh\nbeads or a counter.\nFateha (dua) after farz salaah is encouraged by Rasulullah(SAW). The dua\nmay be made individulally or in congregation. It is not correct to insist on\nany one way.\nTo wipe the face after making dua is proven in the hadith. To kiss the hands\nand eyes is not proven in the hadith.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
