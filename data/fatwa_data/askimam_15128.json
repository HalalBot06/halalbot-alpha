  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamoalaekum Wa Rahmatullah Wa Barakatohu\n\nFew days ago I got an email from my friend with the issue \"Taking the Husband's name after marriage is Not based on Shareeâah\"\n\nIt also contained the following detail.\n\nKindly give me your kind comments, so that we can keep ourselves on the right path.\n\nBy Asma bint Shameem\n\nIn our eagerness to copy the West, we Muslims have adopted many of their practices which have no basis in the Shareeah. And among them is the practice of a woman changing her family name to that of her husband after she gets married.\nThe fact is that Islam does not require woman to change her name at marriage and there is nothing in the Sunnah to indicate that a woman should take her husbands name after she gets married.\nActually, the Ulama tell us that this is an innovated practice that is not approved of in Islaam.\nNow, I know some people will sayâ€¦’ Oh, come onâ€¦What is the big deal?!!â€\nSo read on and you will know what I meanâ€¦.\n\nThe wives of the Prophet (Sal Allaahu Alaiyhi wa Sallam) are the Mothers of the Believers, and the Prophet (Sal Allaahu Alaiyhi wa Sallam), is the noblest of people and the best example. And yet when we look at their example, we will realize that when the Prophet(Sal Allaahu Alaiyhi wa Sallam) married any of his wives, NOT ONE of them took his name. On the contrary, each one of them kept her fathers name even if her father was a kaafir. Similarly, the wives of the Sahaabah and those who came after them did not change their names.\nDid you ever think why they didnt do that?\nSurely, if it was a good thing, the wives of the Prophet(Sal Allaahu Alaiyhi wa Sallam) would have done it and the Prophet(Sal Allaahu Alaiyhi wa Sallam) would himself have instructed it and encouraged them to do it.\nThat is because it is Allaahs order to keep your fathers name as an indication of your lineage.\n\n‘Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allaahâ€¦â€ [al-Ahzaab 33:5]\n\nAnd the Prophet (Sal Allaahu Alaiyhi wa Sallam) said: \"Whoever calls himself by other than his fathers\n\nname, will be cursed by Allaah, the angels and all the people.\" (Ibn Maajah -Saheeh by al-Albaani).\n\nAnd he (Sal Allaahu Alaiyhi wa Sallam) also said:\n‘Whoever knowingly claims to belong to anyone other than his father, Paradise will be denied him.â€ (Ahmad, al-Bukhaari, Muslim).\n\nNow some might argueâ€¦.’But the woman is not claiming that her father is someone else. She is just honoring her husband or she doesnt mean it that way. She just wants to belong to her husband out of love for him.â€\nTo those people I sayâ€¦.\nIf it was a matter of honor to have the husbands name attached to the wifes, wouldnt our Ummahaat have done that??\nIsnt it the biggest honor in the WORLD to have the name of the Prophet(Sal Allaahu Alaiyhi wa Sallam) attached to yours?? And yet the wives of the Prophet(Sal Allaahu Alaiyhi wa Sallam) didnt do that.\nEver wonder why??\nAnd if it was a matter of expressing love for the husband, no relationship between a husband and wife on the face of this earth was better than the relationship between the Prophet(Sal Allaahu Alaiyhi wa Sallam) and his wives. And yet none of the Mothers of the Believers expressed their love for the Prophet (Sal Allaahu Alaiyhi wa Sallam) by changing their last names.\n\n \n\nIt doesn't make any sense\nThe last name is an indication of the father of the person and represents the persons lineage.\nShaykh Bakr Abu Zayd said: ‘This is one of the beauties of Shareeah, because calling a person by his fathers name is more appropriate for knowing who is who and telling people apartâ€¦..â€ (Tasmiyat al-Mawlood, 30, 31).\n\n \n\nOriginally, the woman is ‘the Daughter of So and so, and NOT ‘the wife of So and so. Since there is no blood relationship between the husband and wife, how can she take his last name as if she is part of the same lineage?\nAnd surely, she is not claiming that he is her father!!!!\nAlso what happens if she gets divorced, or her husband dies, and she  marries another man? Will she keep changing her surname every time she marries another man?\nIn addition to this, there are rulings attached to the woman being named after her father, which have to do with her inheritance, spending and who is her mahram, etc. Taking her husbands last name overlooks all that.\nAlso, if you think about it, the husband is named after his own father, and what does she have to do with the lineage of her husbands father? This goes against common sense and true facts.\nBesides, the husband has nothing that makes him better than his wifes father. So why should she give up her fathers name and  take her husbands last name??\nAnd why does the man get to keep his fathers name and not the woman??!!\nIt just doesnt make any sense.\n\n\nSheikh Salih Al-Munajjid says:\n‘A woman changing her family name to that of her husband after she gets married is Haraam and is not allowed in Shareeah, because it is not permissible for anyone to claim to belong to anyone other than his or her fatherâ€¦â€¦ And Allaah knows best.â€ (www.islamqa.com)\n\nNot only is it so in this world,  but, we will also be called by our father’s name in the Hereafter as well. The Prophet (Sal Allaahu Alaiyhi wa Sallam) said:\n‘On the Day of Resurrection, each betrayer will have a banner raised beside him, and it will be said, this is the betrayer of So and so, the son of So and so.â€ (Bukhaari, Muslim).\n\nSo, all you single females out there, dont be in such a hurry to change your maiden name after you get married. And those of you who have already done that, it is never too late. Take back your maiden name and reclaim your identity. It is part of the Shareeah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nA married woman may maintain her maiden name. It is not compulsory to do so. She may adopt her husband’s name or his surname for identification purposes. Shariah does not prohibit that. In doing so she does not negate her lineage to her father. That will be prohibited she negates her lineage from her father.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
