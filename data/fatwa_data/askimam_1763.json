  "question": "Hajj-e-Badal, whose Hajj will be discharged?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf I haven?t had enough money to go for Hajj, can I go for Haj-e-Badal on someone else?s expense before doing my own Hajj? Does it matter if it is for my grandfather?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is preferable to choose someone who has already performed his/her fardh haj to perform haj-e-badl. However, it is also permissible for a person who did not perform his fardh haj to perform haj-e-badl even if it for one's grandfather.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
