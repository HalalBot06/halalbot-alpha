  "question": "Why do the Ahnaaf not lift their hands in Qunoot-e-Naazila in the Fajr Salaah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThey do not raise their hands even in the Qunoot of Witr Salaat. The simple\nreason for this is that the Hanafis take into account those Ahaadith that do\nnot make mention of raising the hands whilst those Ahaadith that do mention\nraising of the hands are regarded as abbrogated by them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nfor: FATWA DEPT."
