If either of the parents, or both of them, attain old age during your lifetime, then do not say to them \"Ugh, (word of contempt)\" nor rebuke them: and say unto them a gracious word.? (Surah Bani Isra?eel, Verse 23). %0D%0A%0D%0AFrom this we understand that in respecting and obeying our parents, Allah Ta?ala will not only bless us but also show His approval. Our parents sacrificed a lot for us so we should also do the same by respecting their wishes, therefore we advise you to put the pigeons on the roof. After all, Allah Ta?ala protects everything and He will look after His own creation. Our suggestion is to build a cage on the roof so that you may look after your pigeons as well as obey Allah Ta?ala?s command by showing goodness to your parents while fulfilling their wishes. Do this for Allah Ta?ala?s pleasure and you will be rewarded insha-Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Ashraf%0D%0ADARUL IFTA ?
