  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nGetting married to seek maximum pleasure and Islamic way of birth control. Actions to perform on the first night.\n\n1. Alhamdulillah I am an adult and InshaAllah will be 27 this year end. The feminine attraction tends to seduce me. I try hard to avoid masturbation, but at times, despite of my strong willingness not to do it, I could not stop myself. So finally, I have decided to get married InshaAllah. Infact, I expressed my willingness for marriage to my parents well before, but only now they have started to take it seriously Alhamdulillah. The only reason I find myself convinced to get married is to avoid the sin and attain pleasure from it InshaAllah. But with my plans for marriage, I wish to have maximum satisfaction from this intimacy and wish to satisfy my partner as well, yet I do not intend to have kids for 2 years or so. I want to know if my approach (for birth control) is Islamic or not and also what is the permissible islamic way to have maximum pleasure without having kids responsibility at this time. 2. Is there any special dua or prayer before one initiates the intimate relationship with his partner? Also, is it necessary to have the intercourse on the very first night of marriage (because some people say before Valima one should have it - is it true.)?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Your decision to get married to avoid sin is commendable. However, let me remind you that the objective of Nikah is not mere pleasure. The main objective is to increase the Ummah. The reason you mentioned for instituting birth control is lame. This is an un-Islamic approach. You can have pleasure even with kids.\n\n2. Recite Bismillaah in your heart before the actual intercourse.\n\n3. No, intercourse is not necessary. Merely meeting in privacy without any hindrance is sufficient to have a Walimah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
