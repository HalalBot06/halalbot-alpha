  "question": "Can we pray Jumuah Salaah in the Campus?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nwe live in japan as a student. At our uni, we don't have a permanent praying room yet. There are many building in the campus. Some brothers used to pray in small jamaat in their respective building (2-3 person) and then for jum'ah they will go to the designated building for jum'ah. The distance between the building is 5-15 minutes. Is this arrangement OK? Or should we go to the designated building everytime for shalat in jamaat?\nPlease give us advice ..\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThere should be only one Jummah Salah at the Campus. As regards to the other Salah, if different people perform their Salah in their buildings, that will suffice. It is however advisable to perform one Jamaat for all. The bigger the jamaat is, the better it is.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
