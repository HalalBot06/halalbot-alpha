  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Sahib: As-Salaam-O-Alaykum-Wa-Rahmatullahy. If an igredient(L-Cystine), which can be derived either synthetically or from HUMAN HAIR, renders the food item(s) HARAAM? Wa-As-Salaam-O-Alaykum-Wa-Rahmatullahy. Jazakallah-O-Khair, for your prompt response to my question.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is not permissible to use any item that contains human hair. (Bahrur\nraaiq part6 pg.81)\n2. If the source of an item is uncertain then too it is preferable to\nrefrain from using such items until proper research is made into the\ncontents of the article. In a Hadith, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)\nmentions, 'Verily Halaal is clear, and verily Haraam is clear. And between\nthem there are certain doubtful matters many people are unaware of them,\ntherefore, who stays away from doubtful matters he has protected his Deen\nand honour. And who gets involved in doubtful matters, he would fall into\nHaraam.' (Bukhari; Muslim)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
