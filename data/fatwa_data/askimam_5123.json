  "question": "Assalam Alaikum Mufti Sahab, Can you please tell me meaning of names like Ayan & Ayman",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Ayman means 'right side'. The name of the woman who breastfed Nabi\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was Umm Ayman.\n2. As for 'Ayan', we are not exactly certain of the way you may be\npronouncing this word. Ain' the plural of which is 'Ayun' refers to the eyes\nor it could mean a spring / fountain. I'yaan means eyewitnessing. In any\ncase, this is not a suitable word to be kept as somebody's name.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
