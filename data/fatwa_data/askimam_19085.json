  "question": "Can we pray for the guidance of a non-Muslim? Is it allowed to have a disbeliever as a friend?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI like a Hindu lady. She is very much obedient to me. She always tries to follow almost all of my instructions without any argument. She respects Islam and never troubles me when I perform my religious doings. But when I tried to make her understand the reality of Islam and ask her to accept Islam, she directly refused it and told me that she is the daughter of a Hindu mother and she will remain Hindu. I was very shocked at this. But still she continues her good relations with me. I always used to pray to Allah to give her knowledge and give her guidance. Now my questions are:\n\n1)     Is it correct to pray for a specific non-Muslim for guidance?\n\n2)     Is it correct to like a non-Muslim and to accept any disbeliever as a friend? Do I have to refuse her?\n\n3)     Is there anything I can do for her good?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\n \n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\nFirstly, it is not permissible to be in contact with any non-mehram woman, whether Muslim or non-Muslim. If you would like to make her understand the reality of Islam and teach her basics about Islam, you should ask a mehram female you know to speak to her and help her out. Perhaps they can even refer her to an Aalimah if she has questions. It is also important to remember that as much as we want someone to accept Islam, it is Allah Ta’ala who will accept those whom He wills. As far as your questions are concerned:\n\n1)     It is permissible to pray for the guidance of a specific non-Muslim. Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasalaam) himself prayed to Allah Ta’ala to guide either Umar (RadiyAllahu Anhu) or Abu Jahl to Islam.\n\n2)     As mentioned above, it is impermissible for you to be in contact with any non-mehram woman. You may pray for her guidance, and if Allah guides her and she accepts Islam it will be permissible for you to marry her. As of now, it will not be permissible for you to marry her since she is Hindu.\n\n3)     Make dua for her guidance and ask your mehram female relatives to speak to her about Islam if she is interested. Refer her to an Aalimah if she has questions. It is encouraging to hear that she respects Islam Alhamdulillah. Remember at the end it is up to Allah whether He will accept her or not.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\n \n\nMuftī Asif Umar\n\nWashington, DC (USA)\n\n \n\nConcurred by:\n\nMuftī Abrar Mirza\n\nChicago, IL (USA)\n\n \n\n\nUnder the Supervision of Muftī Ebrahim Desai (South Africa)\n\n \n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER – AskImam.org questions\nAskImam.org answers issues pertaining to Sharī’ah.
