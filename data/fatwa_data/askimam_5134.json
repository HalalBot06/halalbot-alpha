  "question": "Once I was leading a Salaat, and right after I started, I realized that I was without wudu. I wasnâ€™t sure what to do, so I continued on with it. Please advise, what I should have done.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAfter I finished the prayer, I made wudu and repeated my own Salaat. I was also too embarrassed to tell the others who were in the congregation behind me. Is their Salaat valid?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWudhu is a condition for Salaat. If the Imaam performed Salaat without\nWudhu, then the entire congregation as well as the Imaam's Salaat is\ninvalid. It is necessary for the Imaam to inform the congregation to the\nbest of his capacity. The Salaat will have to be repeated.\n\nThe correct procedure would have been that as soon as the Imaam realized he\nwas without Wudhu, he should break his Salaat totally. The Salaat should be\nstarted all over again.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
