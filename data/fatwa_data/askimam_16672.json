  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI belong to a Syed faimly who are considered as most respected because they belong to HAZRAT MUHAMMAD P.B.U.H faimly tree. my question is some people think that syed's cannot marry a non syed person its very bad  and person will face serious consequences for this. some poeple say we do this for the survival of the syed's generation..so is it wrong to marry an non-syed person???..something bad happens..please guide me i need ur response.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nShari’ah has taken great precaution in ensuring that nikah with an incompatible person does not take place. Therefore, Shari’ah advices one to perform nikah within those who are compatible and equal in the following factors:\n\nLineage.\nIslam.\nPiety.\nWealth.\nProfession or occupation.\n\nThe Sayyeds hold the highest rank as far as lineage is concerned. The ‘Alawis and the Ansaris follow thereafter. However, all three will be regarded as equal in lineage and marriage between them will be regarded as compatible. Marriage of a Sayyed to anyone lower in status will be regarded as incompatible.\n\nThe issue of incompatibility in marriage will only take effect when a girl marries a person who is incompatible to her, without the consent of the wali (guardian). The wali will then have the right to annul the marriage. On the other hand, if the wali himself gets his daughter married to an incompatible person and feels that this person would be more suitable for his daughter, then it will be permissible for him to do so. Similarly, it will be permissible for a boy to get married to a girl who is not compatible to him.\n\nIn the light of the abovementioned, it will not be permissible for you to get married to a non-Sayyed without the consent of the guardian. However, if you find a boy who is not a Sayyed, but is bestowed with the bounties of knowledge and good character; it will be permissible for you to marry him with the consent of your guardian.\n\n(Bahishti Zewar (English Translation) Vol.1 Pg.376 – Zam Zam Publications)\n(Fatawa Mahmoodiyah Vol.11 Pg.622 – Jami’ah Farooqiyah)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
