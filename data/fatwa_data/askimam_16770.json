  "question": "The Story of Pharoah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ncan u please explain the story of pharaoh in detail? i have lots of confusion about it. Pharaoh was actually the title of ancient Egyptian rulers like the kings or emperors in Western context. is the Ramses II is the pharaoh which quran is talking about? can u plz explain the entire story in context of islam. because this archeologist and historians is putting entire picture against islam. plz help me clarifying this issue.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is obligatory upon every believer to have firm conviction on what Allah has mentioned in the Qur’an.  They must have belief that whatever is mentioned in the Qur’an is the truth and there is not a doubt on even one letter of the Qur’an. To have the slightest amount of doubt regarding the Qur’an will render a person out of the fold of Islam (may Allah preserve our faith, Ameen). It is incorrect to compare the Qur’an to historical and archeological research and judge Qur’an through their scope and understanding. Firstly, historical data has always been tampered with and has been influenced many a times by people’s emotions and understanding of history. Secondly, historians and archeologist reject anything for which they have not found any proof. Not being able to find any ‘proofs’ does not negate the whole incident and render the incident false. It merely means they weren’t able to discover any archeological proofs. Thirdly, the Word of Allah is superior than any science or history. Therefore, if even some historical information or scientific and archeological fact appears contradictory to the teachings of the Qur’an, then we will hold fast to the Qur’an and leave aside all others.\n\n.........
