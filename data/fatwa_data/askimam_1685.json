Please give detailed answer as this is very hurting for all involved\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, an Aadil (just) person?s information regarding Halaal and Haraam in Shari?ah is valid. (Hidaaya vol.4)\n\nAn Aadil is a Muslim who is upright and strictly adheres to Shari?ah. The Aadil person must also have the correct understanding of Halaal and Haraam. Therefore, if an Aadil Muslim informs that the meat is Halaal, it will be permissible to accept his information and consume the meat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
