  "question": "What about reciting Salat-un-Nariya during a calamity? I have heard some people say that it’s shirk or bida. Please clarify",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n2. Also my lives back home, waiting for the visa, we speak over the phone everyday, sometimes after conversations, I tend to have pre-seminal fluids coming out. Am I able to pray Fajr by just washing? Or should I shower gusl? I follow the Shafi school of thought\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. We do not know of Salaat-un-Nariyah. Is it a du’aa that is recited or a Salaat that is performed. Salaat could mean both. Please clarify. However, Shari’ah has guidance for times of difficulties and hardships. Whenever Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] faced a matter, he would perform Salaat. He also taught us the following du’aa to recite after Salaatul Haajat (Salaat at the time of need): Laa ilaaha illallaahul haleemul kareem. Subhaanallaahu rabbul arshil adheem. Nas-aluka muwjibaati rahmatika, wa aaima maghfiratu, wal ghaneemat min kull bir, was salaamat min kull ithm, laa tada-a lanaa dhanban illaa ghafartah, walaa hamman illaa farrajtah, walaa haajatan hiya laka ridhan illaa qadhaytahaa wa yassartahaa yaa rabbal aalameen.\n\n2. It will suffice to wash the private parts and the soiled portion of the under garments. There is no need to make Ghusl.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
