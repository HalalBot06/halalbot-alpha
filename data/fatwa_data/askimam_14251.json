  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nYou see i go to school everyday and am in the educational system where i live,but the problem is i dont have interest in it,i personally think it is a waste of time because i am learning what the kufffar or non-believers want me to learn and none of this will benefit me in the Akhira,thus i choose to learn about deen but i dont know how to break it to my parents that i want to discontinue my studies in a school system and join a madrassa,as they themselves are not Muslim so they will not understand what i am saying to them,i was wondering how should i approach them in this basis,what should i say i dont want them to go away from islam or worse begin to despise this religion because of my actions or my intentions to join madrassa and dis-continue the school education i am recieveing\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe were impressed by your wish and desire to seek Islamic education and decided to respond to you inspite of our policy of not responding to non-Fiqh queries on the askimam.org\n\nYour consideration for your non-Muslim parents is appropriate. You should not let them have any negative feelings about Islam. As a Muslim, you should be more loving and courteous to them. Attribute your extra care and love to them as the teachings of Islam. As they will be the direct recipients of the teachings of Islam, they will be impressed with Islam and will save your way to achieve your objective to study Islam. First, convince them with your character. Secondly, generally parents are concerned about the welfare of their children and future. They wish to secure the future of their children by educating them and ensuring they are able to support themselves. You should gradually explain your interest of studying theology to your parents and show them the benefits in that. A research of Imaams enjoying a life of respect and dignity would be useful for that. Assure your parents that you will never be a burden on them and that you will take care of them.\n\nFurthermore, it is possible to study secular knowledge and obtain degrees and thereafter study theology. Islam is not opposed to that as it will enhance your skills for advancing the cause of Islam. Whatever you do, do so carefully and diligently. Never break the morale of your parents. Don’t hasten. Take time and plan your future and work your plan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
