  "question": "I made a resolution to stop doing Gheebat",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI went to hajj this year Alhumdulillah and made sincere tawbah regarding backbiting. I had been involved in the past (before going to hajj) in listening to people who talk bad about other muslim brothers and may have also sad bad things about some of my brothers or sisters in that company. Now, I have made tawbah and inshaAllah will try my best to not to repeat these sins. My question is seeking the forgiveness from Allah enough for these gunahs or I have to go and ask forgiveness from each person that I have said or heard bad things about? I can atleast approach the people that I remember that i have said bad things about. BUt I fear that this could lead to some fitnah's. Such as, some people that i have said bad things about are not my mehrams and by seeking forgiveness from them i'll have to talk to them. Also, i fear that some people may take my request of forgiveness in negetive terms and could break ties with me or my family as they would feel bad about the fact that i have been saying or hearing bad things about them. So I am not sure what to do? All my backbiting have been regarding minor things like every day gossip and was not done to harm anyone.\n\nMy second question is about the money i had earned from the US stock market. I used to invest in stock market a few years back as at that time stock investement was permissble according to the fatwa in your site. You had given the answer that we can invest in stocks as long as we invest in a company that does not deal with haram things (Fatwa #  47). Last year, I noticed that you have a new fawta regarding stick invesment, which prohibits it completely. At that point, I stopped trading in stocks completely. My question is now about the money I have already earned from the stock market. Shall I dispose it, meaning give it to some charity with the intention of no sawab. Or Can I keep it. Even though, I have already spent that money that I had earned through stocks during those years, but by looking at my tax return statements, I can find out the exact amount of my earnings through stocks and can try to get rid of it but it will greatly effect my current financial situation. Please advise in this regard.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\n1.        We commend you on your determination in abandoning the sin of Gheebah (backbiting). We make Dua that Allah grants you steadfastness in your determination, Ameen. \n\nThe scholars state that if the statements uttered by you did not reach the people whom you have backbitten, there is no need to approach them and seek their forgiveness. However, it is necessary to clarify the matter in front of those whom you have spoken to that the reality of what you have said is untrue and false.\n\nIf the statements did reach the person whom you have backbitten, you will have to ask that person for forgiveness. If the person passed away you should make Dua e Maghfirah on his behalf. Through this it is hoped that the sin of backbiting will also be forgiven.\n\n \n\nجامع الأحاديث - (ج 15 / ص 299)\n\nكفارة الاغتياب أن تستغفر لمن اغتبته (ابن أبى الدنيا فى ذم الغيبة ، والحارث بن أبى أسامة ، والبيهقى فى شعب الإيمان \n\n \n\nRefer Maa’riful Quraan Vol. 6/123\n\n2.    We are currently considering this issue and suggest that you revert to us after some time.  \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
