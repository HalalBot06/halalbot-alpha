  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe husband is HIV Positive (aids), and the wife wants to have a baby. There is a procedure which enables the sperm of the husband to be washed (cleaned) and then inserted/injected into the wife?s egg. Will this be permissible as the couple is in desperate need of having a baby?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari?ah, ?desperate need? of having a baby does not fall in the category of ?Dhuroorah? which relaxes prohibition.\n\nA need is something the lack of which threatens one?s very survival. It is not permissible for the wife to undergo such a procedure as it unnecessarily exposes her to others.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
