  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. What is the meaning of the name Nurfan (and its correct spelling)2. Is it permissible for a woman to remove her hijab if there is a possibility of her being attacked or even killed. jazakallah khayr.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe are unable to locate the meaning of the name Nurfan.%0D%0A%0D%0AAt the outset, we wish to clarify the concept of Hijaab. The word literally means a barrier. In the context of women, there are three categories of Hijaab; a) House, b) Body, and c) Face.%0D%0A%0D%0AA female must remain in the confines of her home. If there is a need for her to leave her home, she may do so only if there is a dire need. Allah Ta?ala states, ?And remain in your homes and do not exhibit like the exhibiting at the time of Jaahiliyyah?.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf there is a need that is acceptable in Shari?ah for a female for her to leave the home, then she may do so provided she maintains body and face Hijaab. She will not have the fear of being attacked or killed as she is in the Hijaab of her home.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Hijaab of the body is to dress in a way that the form and shape of her body is concealed. The reason to point this out is that many women simply cover their hair and confine that to maintaing Hijaab while they wear clothes that expose the form and shape of their bodies, for example, tops, pants. That is not Hijaab.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn fact, the Fuqaha have stated that at the time of corruption, a female should even cover her face as that is the centre of her beauty. Reverting to your query, why will a Muslim women be attacked? Because of practising on Islam? In such a situation, Muslim citizens living in a non-Muslim country like Australia, etc. should form committees and make representations to government authorities regarding such issues. Freedom of religion is an entrenched principle in all Democractic states. That should be used to secure and advance the cause of Muslims.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
