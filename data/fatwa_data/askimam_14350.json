  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1.I want to know the truth abt mary magdalene as mentioned in the book 'da vinci' code,have islam scholars ever worked in this regard,besidea i wonder where mary,jesus mother, was at the time he went to the heavens,was she still alive?\n\n2.If a person is sure abt something,he thinks he should only pray for it now then is it ok if he doesnt perform istikhara in dream abt it,also can u pray against a bad istikhara,i once read that Allah reveals future only when it can be changed\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The late Shaikh Ahmad Deedat [rahimahullaah] has dedicated most of his life on expounding the incorrect beliefs of the Christians. He has written many books on the subject and his debates are recorded and are found all around the world. You will find the answers to your queries in his works.\n\n2. Your question is not clear. Istikhaara is performed to seek Divine guidance of Allah. A person may be sure of something but it is possible that he makes an error in his judgment. It is, therefore, still advisable for one to make Istikhaara even though he is sure.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
