  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have recently been crying alot especially when I either read the Quran, or Islamic material. Also when I hear Quran's recitation or such, I experience a deep sense of emotion. It results in crying, and all I care for is seeking Allah SWT's forgiveness, and I feel a sincere love for Allah and also for the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Is there a particular reason for an invidual to feel such emotions or such? 2. A few nights ago, I had a dream where I was at an Islamic gathering, and an individual, who appeared to be a person of spiritual & religious status reciting Surah Yaseen, and I saw myself, and some of my family members reciting after him. Please offer your kind guidance to help me understand what I have or had experienced? Jazakallah Khair.

It seems that you are experiencing this increase in your Imaan which no believer could have asked for anything better.\n\nIt comes in many Ahaadith that speaks about the person tasting the sweet taste of Imaan. One of these characteristics is when a person loves Allah and His Rasool (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) better than anything else i.e. to put Allah and His Rasool (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) before everything else.\n\nYou need to continue and be steadfast in the Shariah of Allah and make a lot of Dua and Dhikr that Allah keeps this love in your heart. May Allah guide us All.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
