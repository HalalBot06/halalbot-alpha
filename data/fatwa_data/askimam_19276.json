If a place is empty and does not have valuables, a thief will not concentrate in that place as that place is of great interest to him. The focus of shaitaan is to attack man and weaken ones iman. The thoughts and waswasa you have is a clear sign of your imaan. If you did not have imaan; shaitaan would not focus on you.  The only way to overcome the waswasa is to ignore them.Shaitaan wants to divert your attention and create doubts in you. Dont give in to the plot of shaitaan. When you experience such thoughts, recite lahawla wala quwwata illa billah, and ignore the thoughts. Don’t let anything bother you. When shaitaan will see you are not bothered, and his plan is not working, he will move his focus away from you. It is heartening to know you commenced praying. Be steadfast on that and don’t let anything deter you from fulfilling your obligations in shariah. \n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
