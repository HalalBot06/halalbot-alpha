  "answer": "QUESTION\ni heared that during menses husband shouldnt touch his wife from pubic till knees. Q1: Is it just recomendations or its haram to touch, what is the source of this recomendation. Q2: Is it just about front part only (to not to touch even)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta?ala says in the noble Qur?aan, ?They ask you concerning menstruation, say, That is an Azhaa (a harmful thing for a husband to have sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having menses). Therefore, keep away from women during their menses.?\n\n1. Therefore, the Fuqahaa (jurists) have ruled that during menses the husband should abstain from the navel to the knee.\n\n2. The term ?touch; refers to sexual intercourse and not meant literally.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
