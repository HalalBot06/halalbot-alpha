  "question": "Assalaamu alaykum. Bi-dah \"Innovation\"?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nBy saying your Kalimah before taking wudu or before performing salaah, or before any other good deed, will this be classified as an \"innovation\"? If a person recites Kalimah Tus-shahaadah, then a person is a Muslim. If a person recites Kalimah Tut-Tay'yibah, then is this person also a Muslim?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. To recite the Kalimah as much as possible is indeed an act of virtue.\nThat will not be an act of Bid'at if one does not regard reciting the\nKalimah in the different intervals as compulsory.\n2. If a person belives in the Oneness of Allah and in the finality of the\nprophethood of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) with the other\ninjunctions of Islam, he is a Muslim. He may express that in any language.\nKalimah Tayyiba and Kalima Shahaadah both are expressions of the same\nbelief.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
