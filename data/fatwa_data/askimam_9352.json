This happened a couple of times since we broke up, and i whenever i make repentance (tawbaH) and i pray and ask God for forginvess i become weak again in front of him. I am so afraid of God's punishment, i keep praying, and i pray the sunnas as well but so weak. Whats the dua i can make to be strong?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for your mail. You write about your continued weakness in controlling your sexual desires. Sister, I am going to be very honest with you but at the same time realise that I am not judging you. Many sisters may read this mail and I wish for them to get the message too, just in case they fall into a similar trap. I cannot understand why you have decided not to get married, but still say you love each other and are involved in a physical relationship.%0D%0A%0D%0ASister, who are you are harming when you give in to your ex-fiancee? Do you think he cares for you at all? Is he not using you like a sex tool? How do you know that one day he may make you go all the way and then dump you when you fall pregnant? How do you know if he isn't going around telling other guys what he is doing to you? How do you know that he is using you as an experimental tool?%0D%0A%0D%0ADo you not know that you are precious? You are Allah Ta'ala's creation and He has given you so much honour as a Muslim woman. He has placed you on a pedestal so why allow a man who does not care for you to ruin your life? My dear sister, STOP seeing this man. Don't ever talk to him again. Avoid him as if he is the worst news in your life. Don't even take the trouble to tell him you don't want to ever see or hear from him again. Just write him off !!%0D%0A%0D%0AI guess you also aware that you are committing major sin upon major sin each time you are with this fellow. You are personally destroying your dunya and hereafter. Allah Ta'ala is not pleased with you at all. Please take account of yourself and make sincere tawbah. Be remorseful and acknowledge to Allah Ta'ala that you have erred and promise never to go back to this sin again. Perform as many nafl salaah as you can, make lots of istighfaar, dua and bring an Islamic culture into your life. Give sadaqah too.%0D%0A%0D%0AGive up the values which are alien to Islam and learn to treasure your deen and yourself. A Muslim man and woman are not allowed to date or touch each others body's unless they are married. This is a direct command from Allah Ta'ala. Abstain from intermingling with non-mahram men at all times. I am sure with hindsight you will realise why this command has been imposed upon us. Develop self-respect. Do remember that as long as you allow a man to use your body, you will not be able to respect yourself and no ways will he respect you. May Allah ta'ala guide you and all of us to abstain from breaking His commandments. Ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A1SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
