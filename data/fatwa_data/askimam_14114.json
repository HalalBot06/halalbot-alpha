  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am currently experiencing immense hardship in sticking to the faraid of islam. I used to pray five times a day few years back but now i dont even pray once. When my wife prays she asks me to pray but i just say i will and i dont. I am very worried about this state of imaan and the reckoning i will have to face. Its as if my imaan is slowly fading away and i cannot do anything. Satan has put me in his grasp. Is there anything i can do to change this state of affair. Your advice will be appreciated.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe fact that you are concerned about this indicates your Imaan. If you had no Imaan, you wouldn’t have bothered.\n\nYou will have to confront your Nafs and Shaytaan and extract yourself from this stage of spiritual lethargy. Continue fighting your Nafs by adhering to the Faraaidh and continue making du’aa for Allah’s guidance.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
