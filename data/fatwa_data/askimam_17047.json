  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni am with Tablig Jamat for about 2 years.BUt i've been asked many Questions by many people which confuse me.\n\n1.Why we only call people to Amal (salat,zikir,dua,..) but dont try to establish islam in the government level.if we dont try so then we cant follow islam properly.because we have\nto pay taxes,obey un-islamic laws etc.\n2.Rasulullah (SAW) did not only Dawat but also politics,zihad. but we only give Dawat and say that,this is the way of Ambiya AlihimusSalam.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe greatest challenge facing the Ummah lies in strengthening their I'tiqadat (beliefs) and Ibadat (acts of devotion). If the beliefs and Ibadat of the Muslim leaders & public are deficient, politics will be totally futile\n\nNabi صلى الله عليه و سلم is reported to have said;\n\n“The first sign of reformation & progress of this Ummah is that their Yaqeen and belief will become correct and they will lives of contentment. (Bayhaqi #10350)\n\nBased on the above hadith, Hasan Basri رحمه الله تعالى is reported to have said; “the reformation of this Ummah lies in piety”.\n\nImam Tibi رحمه الله تعالى explains under the above mentioned hadith that; “the correct belief of this Ummah is that they comprehend Allah Ta’ala to be the sole provider and there is no creature except Allah Ta’ala is responsible for its provisions. When this is acknowledged they will lives of contentment”.\n\nMula Ali Qari رحمه الله تعالى have stated under the aforementioned hadith that; “the sign that the Ummah is on its way to reformation & progress lies in them having correct beliefs in matters of the hereafter”.\n\nTherefore it is essential that as Muslims we correct our yaqeen and belief in Allah Ta’ala and practice our Deen in totality.  Allah Ta’ala says;\n\n“O’ you who belief Enter into Islam perfectly” (02:208)\n\n“Allah Ta’ala does not change the condition of a people unless they change themselves” (13:11)\n\nAn effort should be made to strengthen our Iman and actions. How many Muslims really know Islam? How many Muslims perform five daily Salah? How many Muslims dealings are straight? How many Muslims are truthful and honest? What will politics help if Muslims are weak in their faith and actions?\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
