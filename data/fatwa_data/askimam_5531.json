  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaikum. Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for men to wear silk. Similarly, men are prohibited\nfrom using pure gold.\n\nThings that are merely colour coated in gold and imitation are permissible.\nHowever, we should bear in mind that the object must not be beautification.\nIt is not advisable for men to wear gold items (even though colour coated or\nimitation) if the object is merely for beauty.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
