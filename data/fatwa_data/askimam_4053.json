  "question": "Is it fard to recite Surah Fatiha in salaat. If missed, will a sajdah-sahoo suffice?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAnswer 3703: Someone said that according to Taleemul Islam (Mufti Kifayatullah saheb) that if one recites a surah after Fatiha in the 3rd or 4th rakat of fard, he will have to do sajdah sahoo. Please calrify,. Your answer# 3703 touches upon it, but is not clear to me. Moidul Haque\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, to recite Surah Faatiha in the first two\nRakaats of Fardh Salaat and every Rakaat of Sunnah Salaat is Waajib.\n\nIn principle, if a person forgetfully omits a Waajib act in Salaat, he will\nhave to compensate for that by making Sajda-e-Sahw. One cannot compensate\nfor deliberately omitting a Waajib act in Salaat. To recite Surah Faatiha in\nthe third and fourth Rakaat of Fardh Salaat is Mustahabb. One should not\nrecite a Surah after Surah Faatiha in the third or fourth Rakaat. However,\nif he did so, there is no Sajda-e-Sahw.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
