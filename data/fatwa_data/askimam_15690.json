  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. Does Islam allow life insurance?  Is Vehicle or Properity Insurance Halal in Islam? If one is invovled in above mentioned acts un intentionaly, what is kafara ?\n\n2. Some People in my town  work as agents to send people abroad on fake documents.  They take money from the customer and make fake documents of him and presents the same to embassy.  If the documents satisfies the embassy officer, they get visa.   My question is the money earned by this method is Halal or Haram while  both customer and agent knows and agrees on submitting fake documents to embassy.  Whereas it is cheating with embassy people.  Is the earnings of  person are Halal  who has reached there  after cheating the embassy.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1. It is not permissible to subscribe to any voluntary life or vehicle insurance schemes as they contain elements of Riba (interest) and gambling which are expressly prohibited in the Quraan. If one has subscribed to a voluntary insurance scheme, he/she should cancel the subscription and repent to Allah for doing so. There are some insurance companies that pay back a percentage of the monthly contributions in which case it will be correct to take the payback. However, it will be incorrect to take back any amount exceeding your actual contributions. As an alternate, we advice that the monthly premiums which are paid to the insurance company be deposited into a separate emergency account which may then be used at time of need or apparel.\n\n2. Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم  ) said \"Whoever deceives is not from amongst us\". In another Hadith recorded by Imam Tirmizi (R.A) Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said, \"It is not appropriate for a believer to put him/her self in a position of disgrace and humility\". Bearing the above two Ahadith in mind it is incorrect to carry out such a business. Muslims living in non Muslim countries will have to abide by the Immigration Laws of that country. To cheat and fraud the immigration system to attain legal status or citizenship is not permissible. The income earned from such a business will also not be free of any contamination.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
