  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalam waliakum,\n\nI try to be a good muslim and i have the utmost belief in Allah as the great architect, but i have some interest that clash with islam in terms of referrring to film-making.I, however understand filming scenes of violent and rude nature is simply haram, but what about documentaries or films regarding of positive attitude which might help a fellow brother in recieving some enlightment by watching it that would help him in his Islamic Life, Work life and Socializing life. From what i know that images as whole is haram but not if they are blurred or have no emotions potrayed on the face, if such is a case, then in countries such as Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and most importantly Saudi Arabia show scenes of people praying (men and women, that right and women) in Mecca and Medina during Namaz times at all the 5 prayer times on TV. More over these countries are predominantly muslim and are partly run by the government and sharia.\n\nI've been told its haram by a lot people but if you can answer that along with REFERENCES IN QURAN OR HADITH i'd be highly gratitude of your time taken. As i am gonna start filming about a very positive outlook of islam being the greatest and most noble religion, potrayed very simply by a family who are muslims but not so religious and eventually become devout muslims due to a dark family secret of their ancestors and other circumstantial situations which i am sure would encourage other muslims to look into their religion with interest too.\n\nIf you can give a explanation along with REFRENCES IN QURAN OR HADITH i would be very happy thank you\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nWe have been preparing a detailed article on picture making and we will post that on the site after Ramadhan. At present, I am out of the country. You may get in touch again after Ramadhan.  \n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
