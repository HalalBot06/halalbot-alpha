  "question": "Is this halaal? Is soy sauce & wine vinegar halaal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs soy sauce & wine vinegar halaal? \"Kikkoman Soy Sauce is a naturally brewed product. It is made from wheat, soybeans, salt and water. During the fermentation process, the wheat starches are broken down to sugars and part of the sugar is changed into alcohol. So Kikkoman Soy Sauce contains approximately 1.5 to 2% alcohol by volume. The alcohol is naturally occurring and adds to the aroma and overall flavor of our soy sauce.\" KIKKOMAN INTERNATIONAL INC. Consumer Services \"Principally, if the alcohol is extracted from grapes or dates it is not permissible. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, 'Khamr (wine) is from these two trees, dates and grapes.' (Mishkãt p. 317). Furthermore, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, 'Alcohol itself is prohibited and intoxication in every other beverage.' (Hidaaya vol. 4 p. 497).\"\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the alcohol in soy sauce is from wheat and soya beans, then it is permissible. Obviously, the condition of non-intoxication has to be considered.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
