  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShirk literally means partnership. In Shari'ah, it refers to ascribing\npartners with Allah in worship. Many disbelievers at the time of Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) believed in Allah Ta'ala but also worshipped\nidols. Almighty Allah says, 'Verily Allah will not forgive ascribing\npartners with Him and He will forgive all sins besides Shirk'.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
