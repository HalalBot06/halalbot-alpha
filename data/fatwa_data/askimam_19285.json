  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWill watching the faces of my female cousins within the family constitute to \"badcasting\" as well?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nWhichever male can marry a female according to the rules of Shariah have to observe the laws of hijaab from each other. It is not permissible for such males and females to freely intermingle with each other as there is a potential of them committing evil and immoral acts. It is permissible for cousins to marry each other.Therefore, male and female cousins must adhere to the laws of hijaab.It is not permissible for male and female cousins to see each other’s faces.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
