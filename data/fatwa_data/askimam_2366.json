  "answer": "QUESTION\nI feel that collecting interest and paying is haraam but obtaining a salary is not interest since it is money worked for. What if a person can not find any other job and he has to mantain a family?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nConventional banks are interest bearing institutes, therefore, it is not\npermissible to work in a bank. However, if a person employed there, he is\nadvised to search for an alternate employment. If he succeeds, he should\nleave employment at the bank. The excuse that finding an alternative\nemployment are slim is a preconceived notion. If one decides in advance that\nthe alternate job has to be of a certain status, salary, benefits in the\nline of the 'so called' standars of life, then it may be difficult indeed.\nBut if one was to think a little differently, induce himself to accept\ncomparatively reduced benefits, keeping in mind that Rizq (sustenance) free\nof doubtful elements brings a great amount of Divine Barakaat (blessings),\nthe chances are that he will, Insha Allah, find an employment yielding much\nBarakat and blessings.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
