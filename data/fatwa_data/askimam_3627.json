  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamoalaikum We know sum families who r not practising Purdah,whereas we observe the rules of Hijab in n outside our house.We have felt that because of our strict adherence to Hijab n no mix sitting of men n women these good friens r avoiding us.We have told them the Importance of Hijab many times but to no avail rather they tend to avoid us now because we advise them.What should b our course of Action in this situation?Should v continue our friendship,just cut off, minimize or what?Because of their Unislamic attitude we dont want to be too close to them now as it might affect our level of Iman we might become week too by the passage of time.Plz Advise us what to do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJust as practise upon Deen is necessary, it is also necessary that one\ninvite and enjoin others to do same. The purpose of this is not merely to\ninform others but to induce practise.\n\nTo achieve this, it is imperative to apply wisdom and tolerance. In your\nsituation, cutting off ties with friends may prove more detrimental.\nTherefore, you should continue to socialise with them in a way that does not\ncompromise Shar'ee principles. Encourage them to start daily Ta'leem of\nFadhaail-e-Aamaal by Shaykh Zakariyya Kandhlawi in their homes for a few\nminutes and you will, Insha Allah, soon notice a change. Be steadfast and\nconstantly make Du'aa to Allah Ta'ala to guide them and grant them ability\nto be practising Muslims.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
