  "question": "Is it unIslamic to sue a group of kaffir who are harrasssing us and forbidding us to sit in front of our apt.? Plus scandals and other horrible things, bad notes, racial letters, ect.?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThese American people are looking for reasons to harrass, kick us out, etc, by false complaints, accusations, telling us we have to sit in back of the house, and not in front, forbiding us from walking in area or sitting on grass. They say now we cannot be in front of the apartment. Our kids are not allowed to carry their birds in the cage. We are not allowed to have a chair in front, but they can. We are not allowed to do anything, but they all can. They leave racial notes on our car, windows, peek into iour windows and try to goad us into fight. They can't get a fight so they create false accusations. They are making all people hate us for no reason, some people listen, others do not. What can we do? We have not the money to move and do not want to move. Soheilah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf your complaints against the group in reference is legitimate and you have\nno alternate way of addressing the complaints, you may seek refuge through\nthe legal system to alleviate your difficulties.\n\nHowever, if the group in reference has any complaints against you or their\nactions are based on your wrong doings, then you should rectify yourself and\nconduct yourselves as Islam has advised us.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
