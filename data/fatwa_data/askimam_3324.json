  "question": "I would like to know is it good or bad when a single muslim person has dreams about intercourse.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nEvil dreams (including dreams about sex) are Shaytaani dreams.\n\nDreams are not within our Ikhtiyaar (choice). Therefore, it is not within us\nto avoid bad dreams. However, if one sees bad dreams, he/she should spit\nlightly and recite 'Laa Hawla Walaa Quwwata illaa billaah'. Thereafter,\nchange one's direction of sleep. Insha Allah, the dream will not have any\neffect on the person.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
