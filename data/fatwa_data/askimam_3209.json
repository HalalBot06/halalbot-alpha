  "question": "How should underpaid zakat from previous years be discharged?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nHow should I calculate the sum of money I have to pay an outstanding Zakaat. money for all my life) if I am 34 and I have never paid it properly. Or should I do something else on top of it. Please advise how much money I have to pay as otstanding zakaat. I am 34 and I gave zakaat from time to time but it was much more less than I had to give. I was now aware that zakaat equals 2,5%. I have known it recently. It means I have never paid it properly. Perhaps there is something I have to do in addition to or instead of outstanding payment. Thank you in advance.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nMay Allah reward you for your care and concern in fulfilling the obligations of Islam in the correct manner. It is a sign of your faith [iman] that you want to rectify past mistakes made with regard to the distribution of your zakat.\n\nThe jurists [fuqaha] state that one should not delay in paying the zakat without a reasonable excuse. If this delay extends to a year after it is due then one would be sinful. [i][ii][iii]\n\nHowever, in your situation, you did pay your zakat, except that you've now determined that your zakat was underpaid.\n\nWe advise that you pay any remaining and underpaid zakat by your next annual zakat date. If you find it easier then you can start paying smaller amounts now weekly or monthly as your financial situation permits so that you don't have to pay a lump sum when your annual zakat date comes. [iv]\n\nYou may also deduct the underpaid zakat for each year from your total zakatable wealth in the subsequent year. This will reduce the amount of zakat due each following year. For example: If you underpaid your zakat in the last three years and the amount of unpaid zakat due for the first year is $500, then when giving the zakat for the second year you can deduct this $500 from your total zakatable wealth and so on.
