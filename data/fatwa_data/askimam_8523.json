  "question": "Is there any advise or help you can offer to me to help my skin conditions better?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaam-u-alaykum. I suffer from skin conditions, which involve acne, mild rash and have holes in my skin. Skin condition is not the only problem I have, my facial feature is also a problem for me however, I know there is nothing I can do about this. I therefore pray my skin condition to better. Apart from praying to Allah Taallah, I have sought and received help from many others such as my doctor and have travelled to India to see a specialist doctor. However there have been no improvements. Previous medication has led to facial hair growth, which simply added to my problems. It has affected me largely, it is something I am unable to forget about and am tortured by. For the past three years, I have only but cried and felt helpless, I am unable to allow myself to simply live with the problem.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for writing to the institute regarding your skin problem.%0D%0A%0D%0ASister, I empathize with you regarding this difficulty that you have with your skin. It can be debilitating at times for the one who suffers with the condition. Especially when others stare or comment on it's appearance.%0D%0A%0D%0AI would however like to reassure you that no matter what your skin may look like, it is your heart and your deeds which are most precious to our Creator. Since this is your personal experience, you will no doubt appreciate how a person has to readjust to life after her face has been disfigured due to burns or due to an accident.%0D%0A%0D%0ASister, this world is but a test and trial for us. Unfortunately, we are weak and vain. Most of us tend to put a lot of emphasis on \" skin deep\" beauty and we miss out on the wonderful hearts ( souls) of people. I say again, no matter what your skin may look like, remember that Allah Ta'ala personally created your face, He alone knows why this test has been put before you and He alone knows what beauty lies in your heart.%0D%0A%0D%0AThere was a Sahabi who lived in a rural area. It is reported that physically he was extremely unattractive. Yet he often brought vegetable into Medinah city for our beloved Nabi (sallallaahu alayhi wasssallam) who in turn gave him merchandise (which was not available in the rural area) to sell there. Nabi (sallallaahu alayhi wassallam) was extremely fond of this Sahabi, alhamdoelillah! Bilaal (Radi'allahu anhu) was another sahabi who is reported to have been physically unattractive, yet he was so special to our Nabi (sallalaahu alayhi wassallam) that he was given the honour to give the first azaan in Madinah (and he was the first give azaan on the rooftop of the Kaa'bah).%0D%0A%0D%0APlease do not think that you are unattractive or repulsive. Only the foolish or the heartless and cruel person would think that you are. In my lifetime, I have seen many a person who was considered to be \"most beautiful\" become a nervous wreck when they lost the \"skin deep\" beauty. If one follows the fashions and the cosmetic cult, then one is doomed to failure and despair. I see many young and not so young people, but especially women who spend $ thousands of their hard earned money to keep their faces and skins \"young and beautiful.\" When age or illness eventually deprive them of this false beauty, they \"perish\" emotionally.%0D%0A%0D%0AI recall some non-Muslim neighbors whom I knew as a child. They were very \"posh\" and travelled all over the world in cruise liners etc. I went to visit them several years ago as my father felt it would be nice to see them again. The husband had barricaded himself in his room as he was old and frail and did not want anyone to see him in his helpless state. The wife was frail too and her skin was withered beyond her years due to over exposure to the sun and wind. It was like she just wanted to hide herself from the world because of her lost physical beauty. After the husband died, her children sent her off to an old age home as she was too much trouble to look after.%0D%0A%0D%0AAlhamdoelillah, as Muslims and as believers in Allah Ta'ala and Jannah, we know what treasures and pleasures He has in store for us in the hereafter. Insha'allah, in Jannah you will be rewarded for the sabr you make in the dunya. You will be granted the skin you desire there. Do go on making dua. At the same time ask Allah Ta'ala to give you something better in the aagirah for the loss of a good facial skin. You have consulted many specialists and used many treatments on your skin. Some of them have had adverse reactions on your skin. Put your hope, trust and faith in Allah Ta'ala.%0D%0A%0D%0AHave you thought about joining a support group for people with skin problems? Make inquiries or ask your doctor about these groups where you will meet people who have similar problems to yours. It helps when you find that you are not the only one who has this difficulty. You can get a great deal support from them and build up your self esteem and confidence.%0D%0A%0D%0AI would also like to suggest to you that you should emphasize your strengths and not your weaknesses. Allah Ta'ala has given each one of us some strong characteristics which we should maximize. You are perhaps very good academically in some subjects. Maybe you are a skilled crafts person or you have some other hidden talent. Use that potential of yours to its maximum. As I said before, it is not what you look like that is important, it is what your heart is like and the contribution which you can make to your society, family or the Ummah which is important.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf you wish, you could volunteer to help those who are less fortunate than you. In this way you will meet so many warm and wonderful people and this can bring the realization to you that there are any people who also have difficulties. You will learn new and better ways of coping with your disability. You are tied to your problem only as much as you allow it to tie you down. If you decide, \" This is it, it is no longer a problem for me\" then it won't be. It can just become an everyday routine that you have to apply some medication and carry on with your life.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala grant you the ability to strive to beautify your soul and may He grant you the ability to continue to make sabr on your difficulty, ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0ADo write again if you wish.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0ASister Fadila%0D%0ASOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
