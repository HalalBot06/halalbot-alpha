  "question": "Is the divorce valid whilst she is in Pregnancy?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy sister is married to a guy in the USA a year ago and her husband said word \"divorce\" twice, after few months later he said 3rd time \"divorce\" while she is  currently pregnant with him, now someone says it didn't work if the women is pregnant, Is this true?\nPlease give us detail possibilities.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIn principle, divorce to a pregnant woman is valid. If the husband issued the third divorce to his pregnant wife, it will be valid and that will constitute a talaq-e-mughallazah (a permanently irrevocable divorce)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
