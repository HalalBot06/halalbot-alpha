  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nQuestion regarding Taraweeh salat. I live in Germany and there are mosques either from Turkish community or Arab community. They arrange Taraweeh prayers but no where they finish whole Quran. In Arab mosque, they offer only 8 Rakahs and read only half Juz everyday. The imam also reads from Quran and is not Hafiz. Please guide what to do if no other mosque in the area offers 20 rakahs and complete the Quran.  And if it is at all so important to have 20 rakahs and complete the Holy Quran during the month of Ramadan.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssalamu Alaykum Warahmatullah.\n \nBrother/Sister in Islam\n \nIn the situation explained by you, perform Taraweeh with congregation and therafter perform another 12 rakaats by yourself or in another congregation and complete 20 rakaats as it is Sunnat-e-Muakkadah (emphasised Sunnah) to complete 20 Rakaats.If the Quran cannot be fully recited in Taraweeh, you should endevour to recite and complete the recitation of the Quran by yourself.\n \nAnd Allah Knows Best\n \nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
