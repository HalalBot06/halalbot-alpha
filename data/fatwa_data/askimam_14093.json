  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI want to know as to what needs to be done with the postage stamps if one receives a mail and the postal department have not marked them as used. Can we reuse them or send it back to its owner or return it to the postoffice?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe postage stamp is a receipt for the payment of delivering a letter. If a letter has been delivered, then that is in lieu of the payment made. If the stamp is not marked as used, it is not permissible to reuse the stamp.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
