  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease advise, while living in America nd during travels, a lady with age of 57 years, How she should make Hijab, can she keep her face and hands open during traveling and going out for shopping ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe underlying principle of a woman covering her face is fear of Fitnah. If her face is open, then that gives a man the opportunity to cast a glance on her and that may lead to evil thoughts and intentions. If a woman is very old and there is no fear of such evil, then she is exempt from the laws of Hijaab.\n\nThe issue of very old in the context and purpose of Hijaab will differ from person to person. It is possible an elderly woman may look young and she will require to observe the laws of Hijaab like any other young woman. It is advisable that an elderly woman seek the advise and guidance of two members of her family who are conscious of Deen to advise her on the status of her Hijaab. They will consider the issue of Fitnah and advise her accordingly.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
