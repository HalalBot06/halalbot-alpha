  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs salaamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu\n\nDear respected brother in Islam,\n\nAlmighty Allah is most merciful and most forgiving. In order to invoke the\nmercy and forgiveness of Allah, you should make tawba(repent). There are\nthree conditions of an accepted repentance.\n1. Sincerely regret the sin committed.\n2. Repent to Allah for the sin committed.\n3. Make a sincere and firm intention never to repeat the sin in the future.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
