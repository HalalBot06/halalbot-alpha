  "question": "Are the following claims authentic? This Solaah can also be performed on behalf of any deceased family members. The Solaah must be performed after the last Jumuah of Ramadaan until before Asr.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease substantiate with proofs from Hadith. Recently I received the following in an e-mail from a friend: The Solaah of Compensation This Solaah is performed when a person has been neglectful with the Solaah in the past and is not sure haw many Solaahs were missed. It must be noted that this Solaah is not a compensation for future Solaahs being missed. This Solaah can also be performed on behalf of any deceased family members. This Solaah must be performed after the last Jumuah of Ramadaan until before Asr. This Solaah consists of 4(four) Raka-aat with 1 Tashahud (tagieyyah). It is performed as follows : In each Raka-aah recite Suratoel Faatigah and thereafter recite Suratul Qadr(Innaa an zalnaa fie laylatul qadr) 15 times and then recite Suratoel Kouthar(Innaa a?taynaa kal kouthar) 15 times The above must be recited in every raka-aah without a first Tagieyyah until the four raka-aat have been completed. After completing the Solaah, recite Salawaat (100 times) on the Nabie SAW, perform Iestieghfaar (Astagh-fieroellaah) 70 times and thereafter make duah on all Muslimeen and end off with Suratoel Faatiegah. The Niyyah : Nawaytoe Oesollee Arba?a ro? ka?aatien Kaf?faarotan Liemaa Faatanee Mienas Solaatie Liellaahie Ta?aalaa Please comment on the above, as I have doubts as to the authenticity of this. If this turns out to be false, I want to inform my friend not to forward this e-mail to anybody else.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis Salaat and all similar Salaats performed on the last Friday of Ramadhaan are all fabrications.\n\nA person can only compensate for a Salaat performing it or by giving Fidyah under certain conditions. Moulana Abdul-Hayy Laknawi (RA) has compiled an entire booklet showing the falsity of all these narrations. (See Majmoo Rasaail Laknawi vol.2)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
