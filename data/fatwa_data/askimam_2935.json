Jazakum Allah Khairun.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDEFORMED CHILDREN: the will of Allah Ta'ala%0D%0A%0D%0AO People, if you are in any doubt regarding the resurrection, then%0D%0A(reflect), Verily, We (Allah) have created you from sand, then from a sperm%0D%0Adrop, then from a clot of congealed blood, then from a lump of flesh formed%0D%0A(i.e. properly shaped) and (sometimes) deformed so that we display to you%0D%0A(our power). we keep you in (your mothers) wombs for an appointed time as We%0D%0Aplease, then We extract you as an infant.' (Hajj 5)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe decision to create a fully and properly formed child or deformed one is%0D%0Athe decree of Allah Ta'ala. Deformities in the unborn child are not the%0D%0Aresult of any accident. These are by Divine design as the aforementioned Qur%0D%0A'aanic Aayat explicitly states. It is Allah Ta'ala who decides if a child is%0D%0Ato be born with a deformity.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe stages: according to Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), forty%0D%0Adays after after fertilisation the Nutah (sperm drop) develops into Alaqah%0D%0A(clot of congealed blood). Within the next 40 days, the Alaqah develops into%0D%0Athe Mudhghah (lump of flesh). At the end of the third 40 day period (i.e.%0D%0A120 days after fertilisation), an angel is sent to breathe rooh (life%2Fsoul)%0D%0Ainto the foetus. At this stage, the angel calls to Allah, 'Oh my Rabb!%0D%0AMukhallaqah or ghayr mukhallaqah?'%0D%0A%0D%0A'Mukhallaqah' means a properly and fully formed child. 'Ghayr Mukhallaqah'%0D%0Ameans a deformed child. Thus, the development of the foetus into a properly%0D%0Aformed or malformed (deformed) child is decreed by Allah Ta'ala. Allah Ta'%0D%0Aala in His infinite wisdom decides whether the foetus will develop into a%0D%0Aproperly formed or malformed (deformed) person. Since this is the Divine%0D%0ADecree, it does not behove the Mu'min to register displeasure and discontent%0D%0Awhen Allah Ta'ala bestows a deformed child to him%2Fher. Parents should%0D%0Aunderstand that the foetus is a gift from Allah Ta'ala. It is destined to%0D%0Adevelop into a human being. The bestowal of a child to a parent is a%0D%0Awonderful Ni'mat, irrespective of the child being born deformed. Regardless%0D%0Aof the condition of the gift, it should always be remembered that the gift%0D%0Ais the bestowal of Allah, Rabbul Izzat, the creator Who had chosen the%0D%0Adeformed form for the child.%0D%0A%0D%0AThere are many benefits and Great Wisdom in the creation of deformed%0D%0Achildren. Allah Ta'ala Alone is Aware thereof. But on the day of Qiyaamat%0D%0Athe parents who had accepted the Divine Choice will be overjoyed when they%0D%0Abehold the immense rewards which Allah will bestow to them for their%0D%0Acontentment and service of love and sacrifice which they had offered the%0D%0Achild on earth. Thus, whether the child is born sick or deformed, parents%0D%0Ashould wholeheartedly accept it and not bemoan their fate. Muted silence%0D%0A(i.e. a forced Sabr) is not the attitude which the Muslim parents should%0D%0Adisplay when they have been awarded a deformed child. While it is not said%0D%0Athat one should ask Allah for deformed children, it is imperative that%0D%0Adispleasure and complaint should never be the attitude when a deformed child%0D%0Ais born. Allah Ta'ala knows why He had bestowed a malformed child to the%0D%0Aparents. When deformed child is born, the parents should accept it with%0D%0Alove. The Thawaab for this attitude of love is tremendous. We are sure that%0D%0Athe reward for the service of love which the parents will offer their%0D%0Adeformed child, will be the ranks of martyrdom. Parents who care lovingly%0D%0Afor well-formed daughters will be very close to Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) in Jannah. The proximity will be greater in the case of%0D%0Ahaving cared lovingly for deformed children. The deformed child shoud not be%0D%0Aviewed with disgust and displeasure. Allah's Ni'mat should be accepted%0D%0Awholeheartedly with gratitude. He knows what is best for His creation.%0D%0A%0D%0AMajlis vol11 no.8"
