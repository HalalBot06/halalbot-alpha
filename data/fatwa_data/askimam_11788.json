  "question": "Please explain the DO’s and DON’Ts narrating the Sahih Hadiths that should be observed, when burying someone?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome people recite portions of the Qur?an, standing towards the head (1st Ruku of Surah Al-Baqarah) and then towards the feet (last Ruku of Surah Al-Baqarah), while some give a lecture (like a Qutbah) to exhort people to piety. Afterwards they move 40 steps and recite something else. Also, is it just the head that should face the Qibla or the whole body tilted slightly towards the right? Please explain this in detail along with the actual Du?aas (translit + translation) that should be recited that are based on Ahadith.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Hadhrat Abdullah ibn Umar [Radhiallahu anhuma] narrates that it is Mustahabb to recite the first and last Rukus of Surah al-Baqarah. This has also been the action of our Ulama. (Shaami vol.2 pg.237)\n\n2. The sunnat way of burying the dead is to place the body on its right side facing the Qiblah.\n\n3. It is established from the Hadith that after burial, you should make du?aa for the deceased?s steadfastness, because now he is asked. From this, you may make whatever du?aa you want.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
