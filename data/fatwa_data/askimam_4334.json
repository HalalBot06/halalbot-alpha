  "answer": "QUESTION\nBissmilla ir Rehmaan er Raheem, Assalaam o alaikum I dreamt of having sex with a lady then the ladies face changes to my sisters as I am surprised in the dream I actually/really wake up. The next day I dreamt a man I know comes to my (house) door and his face has blood on it. I assume (whilst dreaming) that he had a fight at home --- On these two days (dream 1 & 2) I went to sleep after fajr salah, but before sunrise (does that affect the dream?) Also a couple of days later I dreamt being made feel good, comfortable and satisfied whilst like sitting with a beautiful young girl/lady who I don?t know. I was in physical contact with her e.g. possibly my leg and hers were touching but nothing like ie sex was involved. I had this dream (number 3) when I went to sleep after sunrise but before mid-day.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAll the dreams have no significance. When you see an evil dream, recite\nlaa -howla-wa-laa-quwwata-illah-billahi. Inshallah the dreams will have no\neffect.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
