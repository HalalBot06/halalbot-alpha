  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have been told that Tahajjud salaat, once you start to read it you can never miss a day for any reason, cause if you do it's more ghunnah, so you should only start this when your sure you can read it everyday for the rest of your life? Is this true, what is your opinion on this?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThis is not true. Tahajjud Salaat is a voluntary act (Nafl). It does not have to be compulsorily performed everyday. If one misses Tahajjud Salaat, he would continue with performing it in the future.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
