The web site “Aswat Al-Islam.net” features over 150 different lecturers, some of which are reliable while others are not. Before listening to any lectures, one should know as much information about the reliability of the lecturer as possible. If one is careless in this regard, he may be led astray if the lecturer has beliefs against our aqeedah. Therefore, we advise you to contact your local ulema for more information regarding lecturers you may be unaware of.\n\n2) We are unaware of Shaykh Feiz Muhammad and his qualifications.\n\n3) You may check www.duai.co.za and www.seekingilm.com\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl. Asif Umar,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
