  "question": "to have any sort of disscussion while having intercourse, is it right?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have read that it is Harram for husbnad wife to have any sort of disscussion while having intercourse, is it right?If it is right then I want to say that normally for loner intercourse time it is recommended that man should not think about intercourse or penis vagina as it will caouse him to ejaculate so quickly so he must divert his attention while haveing intercourse so that he can extend intercourse time.But if wife and husband can not talk during intercourse then how a man can divert his attention and then how he can extend the intercourse time.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nRasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Modesty is a branch of Imaan.’ To talk while having intercourse is against shame and modesty.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
