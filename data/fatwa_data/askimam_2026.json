  "question": "How do I pray on a plane and how do I calculate in-flight prayer time?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nHow do I go about praying on a plane? I will be taking a flight overseas (Canada to Pakistan) and I want to know how to pray my salat. There will be a few stop-overs, but the flight will be 16 hours in total. Jazakallah khair.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nYou will need to offer each salah in its proper time while traveling. Use the following website to calculate in-flight prayer times: Halaltrip\n\nYou will pray your obligatory [fardh] salah in a standing position and facing the qiblah.\n\nThe flight crew can assist you if you request them politely and they are usually quite accommodating. Cooperate with them so that they can facilitate your request.\n\nIf, however, a situation arises where you are not permitted to pray on the plane or the plane is too small such that there is no room to pray in a standing position – then you will have to perform your salah in your seat and will also have to repeat it later on. [i][ii]\n\nIf there will be a few stop-overs and if the passengers are not required to be on board the plane, then you can perform the salah of that time in the transition lounge of the airport.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n_____\n\nأحسن الفتاوى، ٤/ ٨٨ - ٩٠ [i]\n\nكتاب النوازل ٥/ ٤٧٠ - ٤٧١ [ii]"
