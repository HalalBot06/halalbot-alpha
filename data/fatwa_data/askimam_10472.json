  "question": "i want to know that can i say only fardh of zuhur and asr during college time or if my salat is missed during studies then when should i say qada.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nalso is it ok to study from male teachers (if there is no female teacher available easily) ?and also i would like to know that can a girl (in hijab)study with boys as there is no engineering college for girls only.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In addition to saying the fardh of Dhuhr Salaat, one should perform the sunnatul Mu'akkadah (The emphasized sunnats) as well before and after Dhuhr Salaat. However, if one is a Musaafir, then the Sunnats before and after Fardh Salat do not have to be performed. There is no Sunnats before Asr Salaats. It will suffice to perform the Fardh of Asr.\n\n2. It is a major sin to miss salah or delay it after its time. If missed, it should be made up as soon as possible.\n\n3. A female shouldn't attend a co-ed college, even if she observes the laws of Pardah. If she really wishes to study, then she could either attend a girls institute or study through correspondence.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
