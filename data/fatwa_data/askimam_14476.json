  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen reading about the life of the Prophet (SAW), different books and sources mention Abu Sufyan (RA) as being one of the wealthy chiefs of Quraysh who was an enemy of Islam until the Conquest of Makkah, after which he became a very pious Muslim.  However, when looking at the family tree of the Prophet (SAW), it seems that there are two people:  Abu Sufyan ibn Harith, who was the cousin of the Prophet (SAW), and Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, who was a more distant cousin.  Could you explain which one is the Abu Sufyan mentioned in the stories of the Prophet's life (as mentioned above), and who is the other Abu Sufyan?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Abu Sufyaan Sakhr ibn Harb was a distant relative of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. He is the one that embraced Islam during the conquest of Makkah and was a very wealthy person, chief of Quraysh, etc. (Asadul Ghabah vol.6 pg.144; Ilmiyah)\n\n2. Abu Sufyaan ibn al-Haarith was the first cousin of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. He also accepted Islam around the time of Fath Makkah (conquest of Makkah). Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] liked him a lot after he embraced Islam. He was also given the glad tidings of Jannah. He passed away during the Khilaafah of Umar ibn al-Khattaab [radhiallaahu anhu]. (Ibid pg.141)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
