  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan I use interest acquired from cancelled life insurance policies to settle interest on my bond and overdraft?  Original amount of bond has long been paid off, just basically interest that remains.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIf you are poor and needy, you may use the interest earned from the cancelled life insurance to pay off the interest portion of the bond. However, if you are not poor and needy it is not permissible to use the interest to pay it off.\n\nAnd Allah knows best \n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
