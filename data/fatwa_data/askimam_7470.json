  "question": "Is it possible to do work which I feel required? In written we show on paper that we do extensive testing,but while doing actual testing we don't do as much as we have showed on paper",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am in testing for 2 yrs.In our project there is one release for every 6 months. we do testing for the product for new developments in every release. If we find any faults,we raise fault report.After seeing our fault report,our developers fix the fault.Then we do testing for that fault.We are supposed to test some related functionality in addition to the actual fault.In written we show on paper that we do extensive testing,but while doing actual testing we don't do as much as we have showed on paper.Ofcourse I test some related funtionalty. Generally I test reasonably good compared to others.While testing any fault,I do testing what ever I feel sufficient.Actually some times we have time also. But I think testing all the thing which is shown on the paper is waste of time,some times what ever given on the paper may also be not required.I think what ever I am doing is sufficient.So some times I don't even check what is given on paper.I test whatever I think sufficient.Am I committing any sin by doing so? If this is a sin how to compensate this? Do I have to give money to the company by calculating the time required to test those faults which were not tested by me extensively.Or is it sufficient If I test those fault reports again now? I may or may not find any errors now as in between some other people might have tested those areas and the product is also released into the field.Or can I do extra work for the company\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf you are hired by the company to test its new products and you are also given the discretion to test whatever you feel is appropriate, then that is sufficient.\n\nYou will not be liable for not testing every aspect of the product which you feel is not necessary.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
