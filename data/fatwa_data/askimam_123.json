  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSome learned men claim that the six fasts of the month of Shawwaal are bid'ah (innovation). Please comment.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nThe fasting of six day of shawwaal is proven from a Hadith in Sahih Muslim (No.1164), Sahih Ibn Khuzaimah (No.2114) etc and there are many other narrations bearing out the same meaning, thus it is Sunnah. \n\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n(2004-07-23)"
