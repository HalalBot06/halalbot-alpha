  "answer": "QUESTION\n(1) Is there a way to increase my intellect level? (2) I accidentally touched a sharp object and cut my finger. The blood was flowing for a while and I squeezed my finger to take all of it out until it stop bleeding and then I put a bandage on. Was my fast valid?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There are many possible reasons for one?s weak memory, for example, anxiety, diet, sinning, etc. Imaam Shafi?ee (ra) who was so well known for his excellent memory put this aspect so aptly in a poem - he states: \"I complained to Waqi about my bad memory - So he advised me to leave sin And he said: know that knowledge is light - And the light of Allah is not given to a sinner.? We suggest you explore all possible avenues to strengthen your memory. Kindly refer attached\n\n2. By blood coming out of the body, the fast is not invalidated. It is not necessary to make Qadhaa.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
