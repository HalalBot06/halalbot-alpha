  "answer": "QUESTION\nI work for a company that specialises in producing accounts for small and large companies. I have been recently transferred to another accounts department. In this department, accounts are produced for the brewery industry (mainstream industry to sell alcohol). We produce management accounts for each public house that the brewery has. Although each public house does not directly benefit from the services we provide, as we only take the information provided to us and place it in a format that accountants can understand. There is great benefit for me to remain in this department as I am gaining good knowledge. 1) I would like to know if I am allowed to work in such a department. 2) I would also like to know if one is allowed to perform namaaz of Istikhaarah in the masjid, after Isha and is it better to perform in the masjid than in ones house.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour practise to provide information in a format to accountants for the brewery company is permissible, but undesirable.\n\nIt is permissible as you are not directly involved in the breweries deal. It is undesirable as your contributions to the breweries company is assisting in sin. Allah Ta?ala states, ?And do not assist in sin.? (Maaidah)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
