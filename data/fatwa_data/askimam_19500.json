  "question": "My children use books with explicit human pictures in their maktab. Is this permissible?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThe maktab where my children study has started using books with tasweer (drawn pictures of humans and animals with faces and eyes explicitly depicted). I approached the principal who is a mustanad alim with my concern from a fiqhi point of view.  He told me that his teachers and a certain local Mufti sahib have said it is okay for educational purposes.\n\nI find this position very difficult to accept as I have been brought up and brought up my children to shun all forms of tasweer.\n\nPlease advise me as to what course of action I should take in this situation to gain the pleasure of Allah Ta’ālā.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nWe are very pleased to see the concern you display for your children’s education.  May Allah Ta῾ālā grant your children beneficial knowledge. Āmīn.\n\nContextually, we do not see any necessity for such material in a maktab.  The makātib system has been running for hundreds of years.  Millions of children graduated with exceptional grades from the makātib without having to ever utilise such material.  The same Qur῾an which was taught then is being taught now. \n\nTo introduce such methods into our makātib system will be compromising the efforts of our pious predecessors.  Such makātib risk losing all spiritual blessings.   \n\nYou may consult the principal and the board of governors of the maktab your children study in.  If they are adamant on using such text books then encourage them to efface all facial features.  If they resist then a positive way would be to consult other parents and raise awareness regarding this issue.  Public pressure will surely cripple any resistance.  In all cases, present yourself with respect and leave with dignity. \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
