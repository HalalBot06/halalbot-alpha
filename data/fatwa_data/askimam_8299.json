  "answer": "QUESTION\nThat Yemen is a blessed nation ,also Syria. I have also heard that najd was not blessed by the prophet [saw] . He {saw} said great fitna would rise as well as the horns of shaiytan out of Najd , Is this hadith true? Did the prophet [saw] say that faith is Yemeni and wisdom is Yemeni and why was muadh bin jabal R.A sent there to be governor, were any other sahaba sent to other nations to be governor?. Could you Tell me about the prophet HUD alahis salaam like where he was from and how many followers he had . I?m planning to study in Yemen because I want to become hafiz and study Arabic , Is the madrasa in Tarim a good choice? I follow hanafi but im going to study in a country that?s mainly shafi is that alright because I?m going to become hafiz and not an alim or mufti? I want to study Quran and original Arabic not fiqh\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSayyiduna Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Faith (Imaan) is Yemeni and wisdom is also Yemeni.? (recorded by Imaam Bukhari in his Sahih Hadith4388)%0D%0A%0D%0AThere are many narrations which discuss the virtue of Shaam (Syria and surrounding areas). In fact, several books have been written by various Ulama and Muhadditheen just on the topic, e.g. Fadhaail-us-Shaam of Hafiz ibn Hajar al-Hanbali, the first 2 parts of Taareekh Dimish of Haafiz ibn Asaakir, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs for Najd being the place of Fitnah and the rising of the horn of Shaytaan, this is deduced by some people from a Hadith which states that this would take place in the east, and Najd is east of Madinah. This Hadith has been recorded by Imaam Muslim in his Sahih (Hadith188)%0D%0A%0D%0ALike Sayyiduna Mu?aadh (Radhiallaahu Anhu), Sayyiduna Abu-Moosa al-Ash?ariy (Radhiallaahu Anhu) was also sent to Yemen as a governor and to teach Deen to the people. Whilst Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was still living in Makkah, he sent Sayyiduna Mus?ab ibn Umair (Radhiallaahu Anhu) to Madeenah as a teacher and a guide for the people of Madina. Sayyiduna Hood (Alayhis salaam) was from Yemen. (Qasasun-Nabiyyeen pg.97)%0D%0A%0D%0AAlhamdulillah, it is good that you have the urge to be a Haafiz of the noble Qur?aan. There is no harm in memorizing the Qur?aan under anyone who adheres to the Sunnah. We are unaware of the particular Madrasah in Tarim.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
