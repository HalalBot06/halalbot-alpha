  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy dad gambles, he has been gambling for the past 40 years. Know he is in his 50's. His gambling is destroying our family. What can we do to stop him from gambling? we have confronted him many times but he does not listen and now his gambling is getting worser. A learned elder has told us to do taweez, as this method has also worked before. Is this a correct method. Is doing taweez shirk?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nTo make Taweez is not Shirk. The following makes this clear.\n\nAllah Taãla says in the Noble Qurãn, 'In the Qurãn is (spiritual, physical) cure for people.'\n\nThe opening chapter of the Noble Qurãn, Surah Faatiha is also called the chapter of Shifaa. It is recorded in the Bukhari Shareef vol. 1 p. , 'A ruler of a certain clan was stung by a creature, the people of the area requested the Sahaaba to cure him, one Sahaabi read Surah Faatiha and blew on the affected area and cured the ruler. The Prophet (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) even praised the Sahaabi for doing so.\n\nFrom the above quotations, it is clear that the verses of the Noble Qurãn is a means of cure. Treating oneself with Taweez containing verses of the Qurãn is similar to treating oneself with medication. By using medication, one merely places his trust in Allah Taãla and use the medication as a means of cure. The effect in the means is with the Will of Allah Taãla so, too is the usage of the Taweez.\n\nThe art of making Taweez is a science independent to other known sciences. People who have studied this science are most knowledgeable to explain its vast understanding. One thing must be outlined at the outset is that anyone practising the making of Taweez cannot ascribe (in his method and application) partners with Allah Taãla. Any act of Kufr is unacceptable in Islam.\n\nThe people during the time of Jaahiliyya had an incorrect belief that the stars and planets cause rainfall, but the Prophet (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) dismissed that. The drawings and illustrations used in Taweez are like the concepts used in geometry, etc. to arrive at a solution.\n\nIn conclusion, consider the following Hadith: Abu Khuzaymah (Radhiallaahu Ánhu) narrates from his father that he asked Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam), 'Inform me about Rukan (blowing in water and Taweez), medication, and means of security, does it change Taqdeer (predestination)? He replied, 'They (all the above) are within Taqdeer. (Mishkãt pg. 22)\n\nIt is our opinion that you refer your matter to a local Aalim for personal attention and guidance. You could refer to Hadhrat Mufti Ismail Kachholvi Saheb of of 71 Fairbank Road, Girlington, Bradford BD8 9JU Telefax: 01274-822538.

Many people have benefitted from his spiritual discourses and guidance.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
