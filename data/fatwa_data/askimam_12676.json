  "question": "What if oneâ€™s good deeds are heavier than the bad by just One more good Deed, what will happen?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamualaikum Dear Mufti sahab and staff, I hope you are all fine and well Inshallah. #1) On the day if Qiyama, I f a Muslim person shall have his scale of good deeds heavier than his bad deeds by the presence of just ONE more good deed, will he go straight to Jannah because of that 1 more good deed, or will he have to suffer in hell first? What if his bad deeds are just ONE more heavier what will be the outcome? And Thirdly, What if a Muslim?s Good and Bad deeds are exactly equal in count, what will then be the outcome? #2) What is the significance, if there is any, of saying salaam to the 2 angels on our right and left sides at the end of our salaahs? #3) A full hafiz-e-Quran will get many rewards and gets to stand before Allah (SWT) and recite the Quran until he stops which will increases his positions in Jannah as he recites each ayah. A hafiz is one who preserves the Quran. Aren?t every Muslim a Hafiz of the surahs he/she memorizes and doesn?t forget? Will we get similar rewards (maybe less in number) for our efforts of memorizing the portions of the Quran and will we be able to stand before Allah (SWT) and recite as much as we memorized and increase our Positions in Jannah as well? Jazakallahu khair for all your time and help! May Allah (SWT) reward you infinitely and make you( muftis and all Staff) as well as this whole ummah among the most honored on the Day of Qiyama.Assalaamaualaikum\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Allah has sent very person into the world for the purpose of His worship. The more one will worship and obey Allah, the more he will be rewarded in the hereafter. The actions of every person will be weighed on the day of Judgment. If the good deeds are heavier, even by one deed, he will be entered into Jannah, and if the evil deeds outweigh the good, he will be put through the process of going into Jahannam and after being cleansed of the sin, he will be put into Jannah. Regarding those whose actions, good and bad, are equal, the Qur?aan terms them As-haabul A?raaf. Ibn Jareer [Radhiallaahu anhu] has narrated from Hadhrat Huzayfah [Radhiallaahu anhu] that Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] mentioned regarding As-haabul A?raaf, ?Those whose actions, good and bad, will be equal on the scale. That such people will be saved from Jahannam, but initially will not enter Jannah. They will be kept in the place of A?raaf, a place between Jannah and Jahannam. Thereafter, they will be forgiven and granted entrance to Jannah.?%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The significance of making Salaam to the angels on the right and left in Salaat is that it is a reminder for a person that he constantly has two noble beings who are constantly monitoring and writing down one?s actions. This reminder will encourage one to try to do as much good as possible.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Allah rewards every person according to the effort and sacrifice he makes. A Hafiz due to making a great sacrifice to learn and memorise the Qur?aan is granted a very high position by Allah. The treasures of Allah has no limits. Allah will reward any person who strives to learn the Qur?aan, even though it may be a small portion. It is narrated that any person who strives to learn the Qur?aan and passes away before completing this task, Allah will appoint an angel to teach him the Qur?aan and he will be raised amongst the Huffaaz on the day of Qiyaamat, Insha Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AQari Ismail Abdul- Aziz%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN QUR?AANIC SCIENCES AND RECITATIONS%0D%0A%0D%0Achecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
