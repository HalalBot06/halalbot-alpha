  "question": "I understand that the Bidah is of two types, good and bad. Who has the authority to decide if certain Bidah is one or the other? What is the correct terminology for these?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nE.g.: Would performing certain types of Wazaif fall into one category or the other since these are based on \"certain scholar's or Holy people's\" viewpoints and NOT the Sahih Ahadith? In other words where should one draw the line?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Mubaah to recite Wazaaif that are not in the Qur'aan and Hadith if the\nwords and meanings are not contrary to the Shari'ah.\n\nThe general principle of a Mubaah act is that one should not regard that as\ncompulsory by insisting on it or reproaching people who do not follow it. To\ninsist on something Mubaah or reproach others for not following it will be\nBid'at as that attitude displays distortion of Deen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
