  "question": "Halal food mixing with haraam food.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy 2nd question about food,as I say we work for oilfield and eating is can not be alone we have to eat with rest, we need to know if any halal meat which is not proper way cut as Islam say. that meet we can eat or not. 2nd thing we eat with every body and food cook by non Muslim and they don?t care about mixing pots and spoons while cooking or serving. Can we eat there or not? If no what we do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe quran orders us to eat that which is tayyib. Tayyib is that food which\nis halaal beyond doubt. If the meat is not slaughtered according to the\nshariah, or non-muslims mix up halaal with haraam, then you should abstain\nfrom eating such food. We advise you make private arrangements for your food.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
