  "question": "Women trimming each other's hair in Hajj",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it permissible for women to trim each other?s hair in order to come out from the state of Ihraam, i.e. after all the acts of Hajj are complete and only the trimming of the hair remains?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen a person, male or female, completes all the acts of Hajj before coming out of Ihraam, the Muhrim (person in the state of Ihraam) may cut his own hair or another person?s hair even though the other person is also a Muhrim. There will be no penalty for that. (Muallimul Hujjaaj pg.205; Idaratul Qur?aan)"
