  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy questions pertains to the recent earthquake that took place in India which resulted in vast loss for our fellow-muslims, especially Ahmedabad. When Allah gives earthquakes, is there a particular reason for it or for other natural calamities to take place, Islamically speaking. Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala says in the noble Qur'aan, 'Destruction appears in the land and%0D%0Asea by the actions of men that they may suffer the consequences for some of%0D%0Atheir misdeeds in order that they may return (to Allah in obedience).' (Rum%0D%0A41)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn these times of depravity and moral decadence, the punishment of Allah Ta'%0D%0Aala descending on the disobedient is not a matter to be taken lightly.%0D%0ARather, this is an eye-opener and a reminder to all of us to repent to Allah%0D%0ATa'ala, to return to the Divine injunctions and act upon them as shown to us%0D%0Aby the Messenger (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) before we too are seized fro%0D%0Aour misdeeds. May Allah Ta'ala save us all from His displeasure and grant us%0D%0Athe wisdom and ability to obey him.%0D%0A%0D%0AAll natural occurances and happenings, including, earthquakes, hurricanes,%0D%0Avolcanic eruptions, etc. are in the control of Allah Ta'ala. In numerous%0D%0AAayats of the Qur'aan, Allah calls our attention to this fact that upon%0D%0Awitnessing these signs, we may come to recognize the greatness and might of%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala. The cycle of the sun, moon, the movement of the planets and%0D%0Astars are all signs for us to take heed.%0D%0A'For the sun, a fixed cycle. That has been decreed by the Mighty the%0D%0AAll-Knowing. And for the moon, we have set stations (to traverse) until she%0D%0A(wanes) to become like a withered date stalk. Not permitted it is, for the%0D%0Asun to catch up the moon, nor for the night to precede the day. Each (just)%0D%0Aswims along in it's (fixed) orbit.' (Yaseen)%0D%0A%0D%0Adespite being witness to these manifestations of Allah's power, the Merciful%0D%0AAllah sent His apostles to guide them to the way of submission. Thus, were%0D%0Athe Messengers sent to the nations and many were ruined for their refusal to%0D%0Aaccept the truth. Allah Ta'ala says about the nation of Aad, 'Concerning the%0D%0AAad, they walked the earth in arrogance proclaiming, 'Who could be greater%0D%0Athan ourselves in strength'. Could they not realize that Allah Ta'ala, the%0D%0AOne to give them existence, He was stronger by far? But they denied our%0D%0Asigns, so we loosed upon them an icy wind. An evil omened days to give them%0D%0Aa taste of the punishment of humiliation in this very life. (Sajdah). In the%0D%0Asame chapter, Allah talks about the nation of Thamood, 'As to Thamood, We%0D%0Ashowed to them the way, but they preferred the blind path to the road of%0D%0Aguidance. Thus, were they seized by the Thundercap of a humiliating%0D%0Apunishment, in lieu of their deeds.'%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore, these natural conditions have been controlled by Allah Ta'ala to%0D%0Apunish those who transgress against His law. 'Say (O Muhammad) He is easily%0D%0Aable to loose upon you from above a scourge, or to bring it from beneath%0D%0Ayour feet.' (A'araaf)%0D%0A%0D%0AThere can be no doubt that we are suffering these disasters by our own%0D%0Amisdeeds. 'Destruction appears in the land and sea by the actions of men%0D%0Athat they may suffer the consequences for some of their misdeeds in order%0D%0Athat they may return (to Allah in obedience).' (Rum 41). 'Whatever disaster%0D%0Aafflicteth you, it be by the earning of your own hands, And Allah forgiveth%0D%0Amuch.' (Shuraa)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Ahaadith have shown us that close to the advent of Qiyaamat, when whole%0D%0Asocieties will be steeped in sin and evil, the punishment of Allah Ta'ala%0D%0Awill become a common occurrence. It is stated in one Hadith, 'When public%0D%0Aproperty is treated as personal wealth and trust as booty (to be looted) and%0D%0AZakaat (obligatory charity) is taken as a fine, when knowledge is acquired%0D%0Afor motives other than Deen (religious) and a person obeys his wife (in%0D%0Adisobedience of Divine command) and disobey his mother (in things lawful),%0D%0Aand has a close relationship with his friend yet distancing his own father,%0D%0Awhen voices are raised in the Musaajid and the leader of a nation is an open%0D%0Asinner, the head of a family is the most mean among them, and a person is%0D%0Ahonoured out of fear for his mischief, when dancing girls and music is%0D%0Abecome rife, wine is consumed greedily by all, and the latter part of this%0D%0AUmmah curses the former, then wait for red winds, the quakes, the swallowing%0D%0Aup in the earth, the disfiguring of faces, the pelting of stones from the%0D%0Askies and the signs which will follow one after the other, as do the beads%0D%0Aof a necklace whose thread is broken.' (Mishkaat).%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen each and every one of these vices is prevalent in our society, it is%0D%0Aindeed only the Mercy of Allah that the punishment has not seized us as yet.%0D%0AHow long can we remain fearless of this? 'What the are the people of the%0D%0Avillages fearless that our punishment will not descend upon them at night%0D%0Awhilst they slumber.' (A'raaf)%0D%0A%0D%0AThese frightening occurrences are indeed an eye opener to us all. How long%0D%0Aare we going to remain in Allah's disobedience. 'Has not the time come for%0D%0Athe believers that their hearts submit to the mention of Allah and the%0D%0Arevealed truth?' (Hadeed). Now is the time to repent and avail ourselves of%0D%0AAllah's Mercy, before we too suffer the consequences of our deeds.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala save us all from His displeasure and grant to us the wisdom%0D%0Aand the ability to obey Him.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
