(Maaidah)\n\nTo advertise any avenue that engages in sinful activities, for example, cinemas, pubs, or any avenues that is in commonly known to gather and associate in immoral activities, for example, clubs and pubs will be assisting in sin, hence, not permissible.\n\nAs regards advertising restaurants, it is permissible if they are strictly Halaal. If they sell alcohol, it is not permissible to advertise such outlets even if they claim to sell Halaal.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
