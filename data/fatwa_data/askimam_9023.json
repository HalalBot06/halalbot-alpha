  "answer": "QUESTION\nQ1: What is the correct way to make salaam & reply? Q2: What is the max time & distance a woman can travel alone? Q3: If a Muslim invites one for a meal, can the invitation be refused? Q4: Must a husband/father provide money allowance also, or just the basic needs? Q5: Can a woman work if her husband/ father/ brother works to provide for home? Q6: Can Muslim girls go alone to University?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The best way to make Salaam is to say ?Assalaamu alaykum wa rahmatullaah? and the best reply is ?wa alaykumus salaam wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuhu?.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. A woman cannot travel except in necessity. If she has to travel out of necessity, she cannot travel more than 77 kms alone.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. A Muslim?s invitation should not be refused except on a valid Shar?ee grounds, e.g. it is known his wealth is Haraam or there is some Haraam activity taking place, music, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. It is the duty and obligation of the husband to provide all basic needs for his wife, i.e. food, clothing, shelter. These are the wife?s rights. Money allowance is not her right, rather the husband should be encouraged to stipulate an allowance so that she doesn?t need to ask him for everything.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. In Islam, it is the duty and obligation of the male to provide for the females, i.e. food, clothing and shelter. If the male members of the house are working and providing for the household sufficiently, it will not be correct for the female to go out to work.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. In these days of evil and corruption and shamelessness, sending girls alone to university wherein every type of evil is present is a great danger. Many Muslims have lost their Imaan. There is no denying that there is a need for female doctors, dentists, etc. However, great precaution should be taken. Pressing correctly, keeping the right company, being punctual with Salaat, Qur?aan, etc. is very important.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
