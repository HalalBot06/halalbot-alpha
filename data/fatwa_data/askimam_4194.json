He tells where are the missing things and few things like who did jado on some one or if u have asrat whatever.he sees in the saucer and tell u who that is. Often times it?s very true. My question is is it allowed to ask him these things.because I have seen too much crowd at his place people asking about this stuff Is it haram to go and ask him to know about your health problems or missing things jAZAKALLAH KHAIR\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA person who cures people from black magic or assist them to find lost items\nis called an Aamil. If the Aamil is a pious and righteoss person, he may be\nconsulted as his practice will be within laws of Shariah. If an Aamil\nviolates any law of Shariah in his practice, it is not permissible to\nconsult him.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
