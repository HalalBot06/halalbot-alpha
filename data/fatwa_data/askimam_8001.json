  "question": "No Salat because of the bleeding after the first night of wedding? lady will bleed for 2-4 days as a result of the acts of the first night of the wedding (i.e. not her regular monthly bleeding)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am going to get married in about a month, and someone told me the lady will bleed for 2-4 days as a result of the acts of the first night of the wedding (i.e. not her regular monthly bleeding). Also, I was told that we can get together on the subsequent nights, but the lady has to stop her daily salawat until her bleeding stops (i.e. once again, not her period). Is it true that the lady has to stop her daily five times salawat because of this bleeding? Please make special du?ua for our success in both worlds.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe subsequent bleeding after intimacy with one?s virgin wife is not Haydh. It is similar to the bleeding of a wound which is not an obstacle for performing Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
