  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am Ubed Shipra from India. I am working in a Stock Broking Firm, so Mufti Saheb could you tell me whether it is advisable to work or not in the light of Islam.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf the firm deals in all types of investments like interest, gambling and other Haraam related investments, it is not permissible for you to continue employment in such a firm. You should look for another job. You will be excused to work there until you find an alternative.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nDarul Iftaa"
