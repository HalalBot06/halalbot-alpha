  "question": "What is the maximum permissible age difference between a husband and wife which is recommended by Islam.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam o Alaikum I'm a boy of 26, and i have come to know a very nice girl, belonging to a very good family. I wish to marry her and to propose to her parents for this purpose. But the problem is that the girl is still a child, and only 13 years old, which makes her 13 years my junior in age. What is the maximum permissible age difference between a husband and wife which is recommended by Islam. I understand that technically there is not limit, but i mean to ask which is a favoured figure in this regard. Also I wish to ask if its morally acceptable for me to think about her, be attracted to her and to propose for her in marriage. And do u think our relationship would be legimitate and socially and religiously acceptable with this age difference. Also, if per chance it is acceptable, it raises a question that islam advocates soliciting a girl's opinion in marriage, but how can such a young girl make an intelligent decision for herself. In such case, what are the basis for islam's allowing such a marriage to take place. YOur help would be gratefully appreciated. Jizak Allah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) As you have rightly stated there is technically no stipulated age limit\nbetween the spouses.\n2) What one has to consider is compatibility. This is essential for a\nhealthy and lasting marraige. Do you forsee that you will be comfortable\nwith this lady despite the age gap. Will social pressure, if any, effect\nyour relationship. These are factors for you to determine. As long as there\nis compatibility, there is no Sharee objection to the marraige.\n3) Once a person attains puberty the Shariah considers the person as\nintelligent. Thus one who has attained puberty may make an independent\ndecision. The Shariah nevertheless strongly recommends that such a girl\nshould consult with her parents in such a matter.\n4) You may propose to her, but you may not sexually fantasise about her.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
