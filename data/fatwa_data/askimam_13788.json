Please give a detailed answer to all these questions.May ALLAH bless you with HIS PLEASURE.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAlhamdulillah, it is only the grace of Allah ta’ala to be bestowed with the ability to make sincere Tawbah unto Allah. There are two rights in Shari’ah, viz. a) Huqooqul Ibaad, (rights pertaining to people). These rights have to be fulfilled by repaying them or seeking forgiveness from the respective people. Allah will only forgive them once they are mutually settled, b) Huqooqullah, (rights pertaining to Allah). If they are concerning Ibaadaat (worship), then they have to be carried out like Fardh Salaat, fasting, Zakaat, etc. By not carrying them out in their appointed times, one will be sinful and Qadhaa will be necessary. However, if a person broke Ramadhaan fast intentionally without any valid excuse, then he will have to fast for 60 consecutive days. The amount of Zakaat money not given for the past years should be distributed in the nearest future. If the action is a sin that one has committed, then he has to turn sincerely in repentance to Allah, resolving never to commit those sins again in his life, together with regretting the sin.\n\nAllah states, ‘Don’t even come close to adultery, because it is a very serious evil.’ Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] states, ‘An adulterer does not commit adultery whilst he is a believer, i.e. whilst the person is committing adultery, his Imaan leaves him.’ (Sahih Muslim Hadith205). Therefore, adultery should be discarded at all times, even those things that lead to adultery should be abstained from.\n\nWe are followers of the Hanafi Madhab.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
