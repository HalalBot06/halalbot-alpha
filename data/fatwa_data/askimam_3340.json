  "question": "Please advise whether Oysters fall under the same category as prawns and crabs, or are they permissible being fish. Please clarify whether prawns are halal or makrooh.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nFrom seafood, only fish is made Halaal for us. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu\nAlayhi Wasallam) said, 'Two carions are made Halaal for us; Fish and locust.\n' (Mishkaat vol.2 pg.361).\n\nFish is classified as a Vertebra. Shrimps and lobsters are not vertebras, hence, not permissible.\n\nSome Ulama are of the opinion that shrimps, etc. are fish, therefore,\npermissible. Due to the differences of opinion, it is best to adopt Taqwa\nand abstain from eating shrimps, etc. but they cannot be regarded as swine\nmeat which is expressly Haraam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
