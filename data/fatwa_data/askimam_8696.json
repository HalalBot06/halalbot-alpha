  "question": "Does the Ayat 35:22 & 27:80 regarding “the dead cannot hear” also apply to the Prophet s.a.w.s. or to Prophets in general? Is anyone excluded?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllaamah Aloosi (RA) has written in Ruhul Ma?aani (vol.11 pg.56-57; Ilmiyyah) that these Aayaat negate the ability of the living to make themselves heard by the deceased.\n\nSome Ahaadith indicate that the deceased do in fact hear certain things, e.g. salaam, etc. This is actually by the will of Allah Ta?ala, who Alone has the ability to make the dead hear. Therefore, there is no contradiction between the Aayat and the Ahaadith. This is also a brief summary of the discussion appearing in Fataawa Mahmoodiyah (vol.12 pg.135; Mazhari).\n\nAllaamah Aloosi (RA) also writes that the Shuhadaa (martyrs), due to the special favour of Allah, are not like the other deceased in this respect. (Ruhul Ma?ani vol.11 ph.56). It is, therefore, logical to assume that the Anbiyaa (Alayhis salaam) enjoy similar bounties from Allah Ta?ala.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
