  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhile reading 4 Rakaat Salaat, I usually forget whether I sit for Atahiyyaat or not after the second Rakaat. So, I do Sajda Sahu at the end for this. Is my salaat is valid or should I repeat the whole salaat? 2. In Salaat, sometimes I repeat an ayaat of a sura twice or thrice because I think I have not recited them correctly and then I complete the sura. Should I do Sajda Saho for this. 3. Can I touch the Quraan without Wudu wearing handgloves? A learned person has said you can. He even told us that we can touch the Quran without Wudu through some clean cloth.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. You should think hard to figure out whether you had sat or not. If you are inclined to the view that you did sit, then continue in your Salaat and don?t make Sajda-e-Sahw. Otherwise, make it attahiyyaat. There is no need to repeat the Salaat.\n\n2. There is no need to make Sajdah for this. However, you should try your utmost to recite it correctly the first time and not pay attention to the suspicion of not having recited it correctly.\n\n3. A person without Wudhu can touch the qur?aan with a cloth on condition that he isn?t wearing that cloth, thus, touching it with a glove that you are wearing or a shawl that is draped around you would not be permissible.
