  "question": "Ruling regarding wiping the face upon the completion of dua",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n\nThis is regards to fatawa 16541, please comment. also is wiping over the face after dua is it really bidah?? Please explain with reference.\n\nIs there a Sunnah prayer before and after Jumu’ah?\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhen I go to the mosque on Friday the athaan is pronounced, then everyone prays 2 or 4 rakaat.Then the athan is again pronounced and immediately after it iqamah .Having prayed 2 Jum'ah rakaat people pray again 2 or 4 rakaat.Besides,the imaam when supplicating raises hands then wipes his face and everyone follows him. Is it bid'ah? If so,what should I do (just look at others?)\n\n\nAnswer:\n\nPraise be to Allaah.\n\nThe Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to come out of his house on the day of Jumu’ah (Friday) and climb up on his minbar. Then the muezzin would give the Adhaan, and when he finished, the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would start his khutbah.\n\nIf there were any Sunnah prayer to be done before Jumu’ah, he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have told them about it and directed them to do it after the Adhaan, and he would have done it himself. At the time of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) there was nothing apart from the Adhaan just before the khutbah.\n\nHence the majority of the imaams agreed that there is no sunnah to be done at a specific time before Jumu’ah with a specific number of rak’ahs, because that would have been reported from the words or actions of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and nothing of that nature has been reported from him.\n\nThis is the madhhab of Maalik, al-Shaafa’i and most of his companions, and is the well known view in the madhhab of Ahmad.\n\nAl-‘Iraaqi said:\n“I have not seen anything to indicate that the three imaams recommended praying Sunnah before it [Jumu’ah].”\n\nThe muhaddith al-Albaani commented:\nFor that reason this so-called Sunnah is not mentioned in 'Kitaab al-Umm' by Imaam al-Shaafa’i, or in 'al-Masaa’il' by Imaam Ahmad, or by any of the other early imaams, as far as I know.\n\nHence I say:\nThose who pray this Sunnah are not following the Messenger or imitating any of the imaams; on the contrary, they are imitating the later scholars who are like them in that they are also imitators [of earlier scholars] rather than mujtahideen [scholars who investigate and form their own rulings]. I am amazed to see an imitator imitating another imitator.\n(See al-Qawl al-Mubeen, 60, 374).\n\nMoreover, between the first call of Jumu’ah prayer and the second call, there should be sufficient time for people to get ready to pray, not just the time it takes to pray two rak’ahs or thereabouts, as is done in some countries and some mosques.\n\nWith regard to making du’aa’ together in one voice behind the imaam after the prayer,\n\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen answered this question in al-Fataawaa, p. 368, where he said:\n\n“This is one of the bid’ahs which was not reported from the Prophet or from his companions. What is prescribed in Islam is for people to remember Allaah Alone after the prayer, in accordance with the teachings of the Messenger of Allaah, and this should be done aloud, as reported in Saheeh al-Bukhaari from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both), who said:\n\n“People used to raise their voices in Dhikr [remembrance of Allaah] after finishing the prescribed prayer at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).”\n\n\nWith regard to the prayer after Jumu’ah,\n\nIbn al-Qayyim said in al-Zaad (1/440):\nWhen the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had prayed Jumu’ah, he would enter his house and pray two Rak’ahs of Sunnah, and he commanded those who had prayed it to pray four rak’ahs afterwards.\n\nOur shaykh, Abu’l-‘Abbaas Ibn Taymiyah said:\nif he prayed in the mosque, he would pray four, and if he prayed at home, he would pray two.\n\nI say: this is what is indicated by many ahaadeeth.\n\nAbu Dawood reported in his Sunan (1130) from Ibn Umar that when he prayed in the mosque, he prayed four and when he prayed at home, he prayed two.\n\n\nWith regard to wiping the face after making du’aa’,\n\nThis is not reported in any saheeh hadeeth; indeed, some of the scholars stated that it is bid’ah. See 'Mu’jam al-Bida’ (p. 227).\n\nDo not do that which is bid’ah and do not take part in it; advise and enjoin people to follow the Sunnah; remind them and tell them about the Islamic ruling. We ask Allaah to guide us all to the Straight Path; may Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n\nIslam Q&A\nSheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nYour query consists of the following two issues:\n\n·        Ruling regarding the sunnah salat performed before the Khutbah of the jummu’ah\n\n·        Ruling regarding wiping the face upon the completion of dua\n\n \n\n1. Four rakats salat before the Friday Khutbah\n\nWe stated in our previous correspondence that the issue of four rakats before Khutbah is well substantiated from the books of Ahadith. The Muhaditheen (experts in the science of Hadith) have written many chapters in this regard. Amongst these Muhaditheen were Ibn Abi Shayba and Abdur Razzaaq (rahimahumaallah). In fact, the great Muhaddith and Shafi’ee scholar, Ibn Al-Mulaqqin has compiled an entire book in this regard.    \n\nWe will first narrate the Ahadith pertaining to salat before the jummu’ah khutbah and thereafter respond to the issues raised by the respected Shaykh, Shaykh Muhammad Salih Al-Munajjid.  \n\n1.1.\n\nكان يصلي قبل الجمعة أربعا وبعدها أربعا\n\n“Ali (radiyallaahu anhu) reports that Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to perform four rakaats salaah before and after the jummah salaah” ( Al-Awsat of Tabrani / Nasb Al-Rayah, vol 2, pg 206, Ilmiyya /I’laus Al-Sunan, vol 7, pg 13, Idaratul Al-Quran)\n\nThe chain of narrators in the above narration is sound. (Tarhut Al-Tathreeb, vol 3, pg 36, Ilmiyya)\n\n1.2.\n\nعن عبد الله بن عمر رضي الله عنهما أنه كان يصلي قبل الجمعة أربعا ، لا يفصل بينهن بسلام ، ثم بعد الجمعة ركعتين ، ثم أربعا\n\n“Abdullah Bin Umar(radiyallaahu anhu) reports that Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to perform four rakats of salat before the jummu’ah salat and would not separate them with a salaam; then he would perform two rakats of salat after jummu’ah followed with another four rakats of salat” (Sharh Ma’ani Al-Aathaar, vol 1, pg 233, Haqqaniyya)\n\n \n\nThe chain of narrators in the above Hadith is sound (Aathaar Al-Sunan, pg 302, Imdadiyya)\n\n1.3.\n\nعن عبد الله قال كان يصلي قبل الجمعة أربعا\n\n“Abdullah (bin Mas’ood) reports that Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to perform four rakaats before the jummah salaah” (Musannaf Ibn Abi Shayba, vol 4, pg 114, Al-Majlis al-Ilmi)\n\n1.4.\n\nعن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه ، قال : قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم :  من كان مصليا ، فليصل قبل الجمعة أربعا ، وبعدها أربعا\n\n“Abu Hurairah (radiyallaahu anhu) reports that Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: Whoever intends to perform salat, then he should perform four rakats salat before the jummu’ah salat and four rakats after jummu’ah salat”.(Sharh Mushkil Al-Aathaar,#4108, vol 10, pg 298, Muassasah Al-Risalah)\n\n1.5.\n\nعن أبي عبد الرحمن السلمي قال : كان عبد الله يأمرنا أن نصلي قبل الجمعة أربعا ، وبعدها أربعا\n\nAbu Abdir Rahman Al-Sulami reports: “Abdullah (bin Mas’ood) used to command us to perform four rakaats salaah before the jummah salat and four rakats salat after the jummah salaah” (Musannaf Abdir Al-Razaaq, vol 3, pg 247, Idaratul Quran)\n\n \n\nThe chain of narrators in the above Hadith is authentic. (Athaar Al-Sunan, pg 303, Imdaadiyya)\n\n1.6.\n\nعن صافية ، قالت : رأيت صفية بنت حيي رضي الله عنها ، صلت أربع ركعات قبل خروج الإمام للجمعة ، ثم\n\nصلت الجمعة مع الإمام ركعتين .\n\nSaafiyah (radiyallaahu anha) reports: “I saw Safiyyah Binti Huyay (radiyallaahu anha) performing four rakaats of salaah before the Imaam came out for jummah salat , then she performed two rakaats of jummah salaat with the Imaam” (Nasbur Al-Raayah, vol 2, pg 207, Makkiyya)\n\n1.7.\n\nعن إبراهيم قال كانوا يصلون قبلها أربعا.\n\n“Ibrahim (Al-Nakha’ee) reports that the Sahaba used to perform four rakaats of salaah before the jummah salaah” (Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah, vol 4, pg 114, Al-Majlis al-Ilmi)\n\n \n\n1.8.\n\nعن عبد الله بن مغفل المزنى أن رسول الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - قال بين كل أذانين صلاة.......\n\n“Abdullah Bin Mughaffal (radiyallaahu anhu) reports that Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: Between every two azans (ie: azan and iqamah) there should be salat” (Sahih Al-Bukhari #624)\n\nThe above Hadith teaches us that between azan and iqamah, it is encouraged to perform salat. Therefore, to perform salat between the azan of jummu’ah and the iqamah, as long as the Imam is not delivering the khutbah, will be in conformance to Hadith. \n\nIt is clear from the above mentioned Ahadith, that sunnah salat before the Khutbah cannot be denied. This was the practice of Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and his Sahaba.\n\n\nResponse to the respected Shaykh, Shaykh Al-munajjid\n\nDuring the time of Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) the sunnah salat was performed before Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) stepped on the mimbar. This can be understood from the Ahadith stated above.  \n\nThe Respected Shaykh stated:\n\n“If there were any Sunnah prayer to be done before the jummu’ah, he (peace be upon him) would have told them about it and directed them to do it after Adhaan, and he would have done it himself”\n\nResponse:\n\nRasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) did encourage the Sahabah to perform salat before the commencement of the Khutbah and he himself performed salat before the commencement of the Khutbah, as it is abundantly clear from the above mentioned Ahadith. Thus, salat before the khutba is the sunnah of Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).  \n\nThe Respected Shaykh stated:\n\n“Al-Iraqi said: I have not seen anything to indicate that the three imams recommended praying Sunnah before it (Jummu’ah)”\n\nResponse:\n\nThis was probably due to Al-Iraqi not having easy access to books of the Fuqahaa from the different mazhaahib. However, the truth is that the Hanafi Fuqahaa are of the view that it is sunnah to perform salat before jummu’ah salat. Since we are not acquainted with the Maaliki nor Hambali mazhhab, we have no right to state the rulings of there mazhhab. \n\nHowever, Shaykh Yusuf Al-Dijwi (r.a.) a renowned Maliki scholar of Egypt had also written an article on this issue, at the end of which he states “despite the fact that according to the Maliki Madhab the four rak'aats before jummu’ah is not accepted, however I was forced by the proofs provided, to accept the establishment of these four rakats before jummu’ah as the great leaders of the ummah had done so”. (Maqaalat Dijwi, vol.4 pg.1370, Dar Al-Basaair)\n\n\n\nImam Al-Nawawi, a Shafi’ee scholar, was also of the view that it is sunnah to perform four rakats salat before jummu’ah salat. ( Tuhfah Al-Muhtaj, vol 1, pg 374, Maktaba Al-Thiqafa al-Deeniyya)\n\nIn fact, Al-Iraqi himself states that to reject the proofs regarding four rakats before jummu’ah salat is a weak standpoint. (Tarh Al-Tathreeb, vol 3, pg 36, Ilmiyya)\n\nThe Respected Shaykh stated:\n\n Muhaddith al-Albani commented: “……Those who pray this sunnah are not following the Messenger or imitating any of the Imams”\n\nResponse:\n\nWith all respects to Muhaddith al-Albani, it was definitely incorrect for him to mention that those who perform four rakats before jummu’ah salat are not following the way of Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). The Ahadith mentioned above are clear evidence that this was the sunnah of Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), as well as his Sahaba.    \n\nWiping the face upon the completion of Dua\n\nIt is not Bid’ah to wipe the face upon the completion of du’a. This was the sunnah and practice of Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and we are encouraged to do so. \n\nعن عمر بن الخطاب رضي الله عنه قال : كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم إذا رفع يديه في الدعاء لم يحطهما حتى يمسح بهما وجهه\n\n“Umar Bin Khattab (radiyallaahu anhu) reports: When Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would to raise his hands in du’a, he would not lower them until he passed them over his face” (Sunan Al-Tirmizhi, #3386)\n\nIbn Hajr Asqalani has classified the above Hadith as sound.
