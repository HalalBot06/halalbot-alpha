  "question": "could you please explain to me why making and watching films is haraam and why images are haraam aswell such as taking photographs.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI do not understand it because when I ask someone they say some thing about animation and eyes and I don?t understand and I was hoping you would be able to make it clear to me Jazakallah May allah give you a good reward for answering the questions which me and many other muslim brothers and sisters have submitted on your site.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPhotography, taking of pictures, video, etc. are all totally prohibited in Shari?ah. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Verily the people who are punished the worst by Allah are the Musawwiroon (picture-makers).? (Bukhari)\n\nTherefore, no matter where photography, video, etc. of animate objects are done are all Haraam. however, photographs at time of severe necessity only, e.g. passport, will be allowed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
