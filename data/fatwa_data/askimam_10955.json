  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it permissable for a man to have a hair transplant done. This involves taking the hair folicle (root) from the back of the head and re-inserting that same folicle in the top of the head were the hair has fallen out. This is done for those people who have lost hair for numerous reasons. Please note this is using only your \"own\" hair folicle and not somebody else. Please quote evidences of some kind in your response.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTransplanting of one?s own hair from one part of the head to another is permissible if there is a need for it. Since the hair on the head is not only for adornment but for protection as well, one may go for such a transplant.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
