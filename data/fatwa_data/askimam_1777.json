  "question": "Greeting People of the Book; accepting presents from them.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Are we allowed to greet people of the book (Christians, Jews) when they have their festivals? 2. If we are allowed, how do we do that ? 3. Are we allowed to accept presents from them, in their festivals ? Jazakum Allahu khayaran\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou can look for the answer on www.jamiat.org.za.\n\nWhile it is permissible to accept gifts from non-Muslims, extreme precaution should be taken. For example, during their religious festivals, edibles are generally prayed on; to consume such food is Haraam. Therefore, as a matter of precaution all edibles given by non-Muslims during their festivals should not be consumed. It is also not permissible to participate in their functions and festivals. (Fataawa Abdul Hai pg. 482)\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti E.Desai"
