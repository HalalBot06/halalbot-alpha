  "question": "How is the nikah read",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow is the nikah read as i have been to many weddings and sometimes only the consent of the woman is asked on other occasions she has read the kalima after the imaam. What should be read by the woman and which is the right way?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA Nikah is performed with a proposal (Iejaab) by the male or female and acceptance (Qubool) by the male or female in the past tense and in the presence of two male Muslim witnesses (Hidaaya vol. 2).\n\nIt is Sunnat that the marriage be announced and performed in the Masjid and the bride be represented by her Mahram (father, brother, etc.). The bride gives consent to her representative (Wakeel) in the presence of two witnesses to perform her marriage at the Masjid. At the Masjid, the Wakeel represents the bride in the presence of the two witnesses and the stipulated dowry. The witnesses must be two trustworthy and pious male Muslims who are not her ascendants e.g. father, grandfather or decendants e.g. son, grandson, etc.\n\nThe Mahr (dowry) is the woman's right and should be stipulated prior to the marriage.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
