  "question": "Is it permissible to become a lawyer?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI was wondering whether law is acceptable in Islam because personally I had wanted to become a lawyer but I am uncertain as I believe it may not be in Islam and some people are telling me its acceptable but some people are telling me it’s unacceptable. \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. \n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\nAdvocacy and law falls into the concept of wakālah in Sharī῾ah.  A person may not be able to represent him or herself in a court due to natural or legal measures.  Hence, a person uses the services of a lawyer to represent him in front of a judiciary. \n\nThe profession of advocacy in itself is not prohibited.  This is a service rendered to the client for which an advocate can charge a fee.  However this permissibility is subject to three conditions:\n\nA Muslim advocate is not allowed to plead the case of a person whom he believes to be unjust.  Therefore if he knows that his client has committed an offence he is not allowed to plead for his innocence.  However, it will be permissible to plead for a reduction of the sentence of the criminal on the grounds of genuine mitigation circumstances. \n\nIt is not permissible for a Muslim advocate to help his client in claiming a right which is disapproved by the Sharī῾ah. \n\n3)    A Muslim advocate is not allowed to use prohibited means to advance the case of his client like false statements, forged documents etc.[i] \n\nIt is worth remembering that men have been commissioned with the responsibility of earning a livelihood and providing for the family.  A woman has been given the honour and ease of staying indoors and she has not obliged or burdened to earn a livelihood. \n\nIn conclusion, practicing law is permissible if the above there conditions are upheld.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nFaraz Ibn Adam,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nLeicester, UK\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[i] Contemporary fatawa 146-147 Idara-e-Islamiat"
