  "question": "The Holy Qurâ€™an and many ahadith clearly state that we must enjoin the good and forbid the evil if we are to be of those who believe. Please comment on the following opinion:",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThis verse is a general verse and is supported by a hadith of Hadhrat Aysha (RA) who was strongly of the opinion that this verse implied enjoining ALL the good in Islam and forbidding ALL the evil that is prohibited. Does this verse imply that rather than just invite people towards certain aspects of Islam, such as Salat, Zikr and Jihad, as some groups do; we must invite others to the whole of Deen including the aspects of Mu?amalah, Mu?asharah and Siy?asa? The verse has not been restricted by any other verse in terms of what we must exactly enjoin and forbid. In order to endorse a group as a valid Islamic Jama?at, must they not enjoin ALL the good and forbid ALL the evil as a complete call, without attempting to rationalise the argument and rendering the call to a specific aspect(s) of Islam only?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nCertainly, the Hadith refers to all aspects of Islam.\n\nHowever, if a group decides to restrict themselves to certain aspects of\nDeen, believing these to be the 'stepping stones' of implementing the other\naspects, what is the problem with this. This is fine provided they do not\ndeny the existence of the other branches of Deen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
