  "question": "I wish to read Qazaa salaat. When are the suitable times for reading Qazaa?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have missed many salaat, and I wish to read Qazaa.I was wondering if there are any times which are haraam to read it. Also, what is the punishment for not reading salaat in the hereafter? Will one be punished if he/she makes the qazaa? JazakALLAH.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Kindly refer below%0D%0A2. One may make Qadhaa Salaat at any time besides the following times: a)%0D%0ASunrise, b) Midday (Zawaal), c) Sunset, and; d) After the Asr Salaat when%0D%0Athe sun loses its brightness%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AQ: Kindly explain in detail the Shari'ah laws of performing Qadhaa Salaats.%0D%0AYour advice in fulfilling the Qadhaa Salaats will be appreciated.%0D%0AA: Qadhaa is made only for Fardh and Witr Salaats.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn calculation, there will be six (6) Salaats per day, one hundred and%0D%0Aeighty (180) Salaats per month, two thousand, one hundred and sixty (2160)%0D%0ASalaats per year. Calculate the number of missed Salaats from the time of%0D%0ABuloogh (maturity). If one is unable to calculate the actual number of%0D%0Amissed Salaats, due to not having any records, then he%2Fshe should apply%0D%0Ahis%2Fher honest discretion in calculating the missed Salaats.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is not permissible to give Fidyah (monetary compensation) for the missed%0D%0ASalaats if one is able to fulfil the Qadhaa Salaats. The Fidya for each%0D%0Amissed Salaat is the same as Sadaqatul Fitr (approx. R7.00). The approximate%0D%0Aamount for the missed Salaats for one year will be (approx. R15,000). A%0D%0Abequest should be made during one's lifetime to pay the Fidya for the%0D%0Aunfulfilled Qadhaa Salaats from one third of one's estate after fulfillment%0D%0Aof debts.%0D%0A%0D%0AThank Allah Ta'ala for giving you the concern to fulfil the missed Salaats.%0D%0AHow will one face Allah Ta'ala on the day of Qiyaamat should he%2Fshe pass%0D%0Aaway without fulfilling the Qadhaa Salaats? An easy method to fulfil the%0D%0AQadhaa Salaats is, after each daily Fardh Salaat, for example, after Dhuhr%0D%0ASalaat of today, perform one Dhuhr Qadhaa Salaat."
