  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI was pregnant two years ago , I managed to repay most of the days missed before last ramadaan,( I was in the single digits when ramadaan started)  I had a few left plus the 6 I missed due to have my period., of this Ramadaan past,   I am not sure as how many days I have left to repay now in total before Ramadaan start in August what should I do, how many days should I repay?  Please advise soonest,  Shukran\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIf you are uncertain as to how many fasts you missed during your pregnancy then, make a safe estimation and add the estimated number of fasts to the existing six Qadaa fasts that you have. This will be the total number of Qadaa fasts you will have to keep. So for example if you decide that you have seven fasts remaining then add that seven Qadaa fasts to the six Qadaa fasts of the last Ramadan and that will be the total number of Qadaa fasts you will have to keep.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl.
