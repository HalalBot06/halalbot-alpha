  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni was wondering if you could provide me with a duaa that will help me abstain from evil sins, and will make it easier for me do good deeds( such as an increase in zikir and quran) ...a while back, i had gotten a duaa of your site...it had helped me greatly.. and then i lost th habit of praying. I wrote it down but now i have lost it and i cant seem to find it on ur site again......i would greatly appreciate it if you would be able to recommend such a duaa.....\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nDu’aa is very integral part of a Muslim’s life. Through du’aa, man’s problems are solved by Allah Ta’ala There are Qur’aanic Aayaats and Ahaadith encouraging supplication [du’aa]. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has mentioned times when du’aas are accepted. One of the 99 attributes of Allah is ‘Al-Mujeeb’ (one who answers supplications). Du’aa is not confined to any language, it can be made in any language. Allah understands them all. His knowledge encompasses everything. Du’aa must be made with sincerity and with focus on Allah (that Allah can solve my problems), that He is All-Powerful and none if as poweful as Him.\n\nTogether with du’aa, effort must be made. Look at the lives of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and the Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhu]. They had their full focus on Allah. They did not suffice on du’aa. They also made effort to please Allah. In Arabic, there is a saying, ‘whosoever makes effort will reap reward.’\n\nEffort must be made to abstain from evil sins. The places of sin must be avoided. Effort must be made to do good deeds. One cannot sit back waiting for something to happen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
