  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. It might sound a bit funny..but during salaah, i often have a feeling of breaking wind(gases). Many a times i cannot figure out whether it has actually happened or not. As a result of the doubt I have to perform wudu a number of times during a single waqt of salah..It becomes really time consuming sometimes and may ALLAH forgive me, I do feel really tired of it sometimes... the fear that my prayers might not get accepted by ALLAH makes me do wudu repeatedly at times..the other times i try not to be bothered n justkeep on praying.... Please advice me what to do..\n2.I think I have done a sin..I missed out my Tarawih prayers during the last 11 days of Ramadan..i was lazy during early part of the night . I slept at ten pm ,thinking I would get up at 2 am n complete tarwih. Most of the days I could not wake up at the intended time. Two or three days, I get up ,but prayed Tarawih partially(10rakahs one day and 4 rakahs one day) I could have prayed more but the problem above(question 1) sort of prevented me from doing so. And now I am having period( menstruation) I have already missed up so many tarawih prayers that I am feeling bad...can I make up for the Tarwih missed up during menstruation some other time? And if i do so will i get the same reward for praying Tarawih on Ramadan? and Tarawih is a sunnat e muakkadah..if i really pray a lot during last 10 nights of Ramadan, can i make up for my missed Tarawih, i.e, gather up same rewards as the Tarawih missed? I donot know whether I will be alive on the next Ramadan .\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIn principle, wudu will only invalidate if one is absolutely certain of it. A mere doubt does not invalidate the wudu. The Ulama’ have written that one should be able to take an oath by Allāh jalla jalāluhu that his wudu is void. If one is unable to take such an oath then his wudu will be intact.\n\n \n\nNabi karīm sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam  said that one should not leave the Masjid out of a doubt of passing wind until one hears the sound thereof or gets the smell thereof.\n\n \n\n (Sunan Tirmidhi)\n\n \n\nAs far as your missed Taraweeh is concerned, you should make sincere Tawbah(repentance) from the ones that you have missed.\n\n \n\nNabi kareem sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam said, the one who repents from sins is like the one who never sinned at all.\n\n \n\n(Sunan Ibn Majah)\n\n \n\n There is no Qadha(make up) for Taraweeh Salah . Moreover, it is not permissible to read any salah during menses. Hence, there will be no Qadha (make up) for that too. In future, do as much ibadah as you can to attain the maximum reward and blessing of Ramadhan.\n\n \n\n(Aap kay Masail, Vol.3, Pg.78, Maktabah Ludhyanwy)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl.
