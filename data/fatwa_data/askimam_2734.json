  "question": "Silence by the bride to be, what does it mean today",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like to know that in today's world when we say that the girl is silent due to the fact that her father is an aggressive person and the girl cannot talk in front of him about whether she wants to marry the person her father wants to or not, why is this silence of the girl compared to the silence of shyness?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nThe silence of the bride to be due to fear of her father is certainly not\nsimilar to the silence due to shyness. If a girl was forced into marriage\nand her silence was due to fear of being physically hurt or killed, etc.\nthat marriage can be annulled in an Islamic court.\n\nIn Islam, the individual right of an adult female is honoured and respected.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
