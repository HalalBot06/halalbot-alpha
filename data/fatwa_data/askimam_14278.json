Thereafter, all assets form part of the Nett Estate and will have to be distributed according to the Islamic Law of Succession and Inheritance.\n\nThe nett Estate will be divided into 24 equal shares and distributed as follows: Wife receives 3 shares, Mother receives 4 shares and son receives 17 shares. Brothers and Sisters do not inherit.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
