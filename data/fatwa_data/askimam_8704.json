  "question": "I want to know that if a person after doing ablution wear on the socks and then after his ablution nullified and he is still wearing the socks so then can he do masah on socks.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have been through your answer to question no 4644 and i totally agree with you, but a friend of mine says that they don't have discussed to what if a person has wear on socks after doing wudu and he went to the office and then after his wudu nullified but as he is still wearing the socks so he can do masah over socks. It is a common practice in saudia, i see my colleagues doing masah on regular socks but i don't practice this myself even though i too come to office after doing wudu. My friend says they do masah bcoz they haven't put off their socks after doing the first wudu which they do without wearing on the socks. Also i want to know that we have a mosque inside our office but there is no imam fixed for prayers so anyone from the office, most of them have french beards or clean shaved use to do Imamut and i have to pray behind them bcoz the masjid is almost 10 min walk away from the office and if go to the masjid it will take time 20 min more from the usuall prayer time and the office people will point a finger towards me. So do you think i am doing it right.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is not permissible to make Masah on regular socks. Masah may be made only on leather socks or its like.\n\n2. If you have a full Masnoon beard, you should offer to perform Salaat. If that is not possible, and you cannot perform Salaat elsewhere, you will be excused for performing Salaat behind the Imaam with a short or shaved beard. You should also apply wisdom in explaining your colleagues the importance of adhering to the Sunnah and keeping a full beard.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
