  "answer": "QUESTION\nhow are you brother, i am 21 years old, AlhumduliALLAH i started to pray 5 times a day  about 1 year ago. my question is that  do i have to make up for the prayer  which i missed before i was 20(when i started to pray regularly). if yes then from what age should i start couting my missed prayers.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMay Allah reward you abundantly in your effort to cover up for the missed Salaats, Aameen. You will have to start counting your missed Salaats from the time you attained puberty. (Maraaqiul Falaah pg.173)\n\n1. When making up for your missed Salaat, the following intention should be made, e.g. Dhuhr Salaat ‘O Allah, from the many Dhuhr Salaats in my responsibility, I intend to perform the first Dhuhr Salaat I missed.’ In the similar manner, you make this intention for the other Salaats.\n\n2. You will make up for your Fardh Salaats and Witr Salaats only. There is no need to make up for Sunnah and Nafl Salaats. (Aap ke Masaail vol.2 pg.348)\n\n3. An easy method to cover up for the missed Salaats is that daily after every Fardh Salaat, cover up for one missed Salaat, e.g. after Dhuhr Salaat, read an extra four Rakaats for a missed Dhuhr Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
