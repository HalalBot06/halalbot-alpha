  "question": "HAJJ. When stoning, if the stone doesn’t touch the shetan but falls into the round dip is it valid?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1.HAJJ. When stoning, if the stone doesn’t touch the shetan but falls into the round dip is it valid?  2. I unknowingly went with a wahabi group who promised me time for 40 rakats at Madhina. But then they deceived me when we got there saying there’s no such thing as 40 raka and it is foolishness to think so and people who do it are idiots. Will I still get reward for reading the full 40 as I paid for it and had the intention inside me for it? 4.Some people say that deobandis and followers of imam hanbal are also wahabies. Why these accusations do u know? 5. my family is barelwi but Myself I am a non-brelwi hanafi. Does this make me a deobandi? I have no disrespect for any sunni.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The stoning will be valid.\n\n2. There is virtue in performing 40 Salaats in the Musjid of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] will intercede for such a person on the day of Qiyaamat.\n\n4. Deobandis are those who strictly adhere to the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaa, that is, Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and the Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhum]. They follow the Hanafi Madhab in Fiqh and accept and tolerate other Madhabs of Fiqh.\n\n5. Refer to 4 above.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
