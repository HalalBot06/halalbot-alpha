  "question": "1)why can't she show them to a mushrik female (who might not even discuss her features etc. with anyone else?). 2)Dowry is 'jahaiz' which is a custom in India/Pakistan",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)I read somewhere that a Muslim female cannot show her hair to a non-muslim female. She has to cover every part of her body except for her face from a non-muslim female . And the reason was that the mushrik females discuss the muslim female's figure with non-mehrams. But these days I've seen Muslim females do the same thing to a fellow muslim female (who wears a hijaab). I've seen these females discussing the Hijabbed Muslimah's hair (telling what kind of a cut or hair she has, how long etc.), and her face (that what kind of features she's got, etc.). So what should a female do in a situation like this? If she's allowed to show her hair etc. to these muslim females, then why can't she show them to a mushrik female (who might not even discuss her features etc. with anyone else?). 2)with reference to Q.6348 \"Zakat to be given to (i)To get poor girls married and give them dowry as dowry is very essential in Pakistan. (ii)To get dowry for the girls whose husbands have sent them home threatening to divorce them if they donot get that dowry.\" Dowry is 'jahaiz' which is a custom in India/Pakistan where a girl brings things (furniture, crockery, clothes, jewellery, washing machines etc.) to her husbands home. In Pakistan, if girls donot bring this, they have to hear taunts of their in-laws and husbands all their lives, some in-laws either kill them, or get their sons married somewhere else or divorce the girl. So can zakat be given to save their marriages?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Let alone non-Muslim women, a Muslim woman should avoid showing her face,\netc. to even Muslim women who are flagrant sinners for the reasons mentioned\nby you. In the situation described by you, i.e. where she fears the other\nwomen will describe her elsewhere, she should avoid exposing herself to\nthese women.\n2. If she is eligible to receive Zakaat, Zakaat may be given to her to\nassist in her marriage.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
