  "answer": "QUESTION\nThis is in clarification on my previous question. I know that I don't have to wear it infront of my own uncle. But what about my mom's uncles? Jazak Allahu khair brother!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour mother's uncle (maternal or paternal) are your Mahrams as well. You do not have to observe Hijaab in front of them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
