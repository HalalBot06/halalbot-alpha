  "question": "1) What does the definition of “Rizq” include?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n2) If all these worldly bounties, wealth, spouse, luxuries, etc. are included in rizq, and we are told that the rizq of every person is predefined. So why do we need to make effort of this world? 3) However, if we must make effort of this world, then what should be our intention in doing so? As everything is dependant on the will of Allah and not on this world. 4) Is there any way in which the rizq of a person can increase? Jazak Allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) The definition of ?rizq? includes everything whether its wealth, spouse, provisions, sustenance, which of course includes food, clothing, shelter, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0A2) The effort is also predestined. If one does such and such will gain so and so. Allah knows the amount of rizq we will use but we do not know. Allah has stated in the Quran: ?Then when the (Jumu?ah) salaat (prayer) is ended, you may disperse through the land, and seek the bounty of Allah (by working, etc.) and remember Allah much that you may be successful.? [surah jumuah, ayat 10]%0D%0AAllah has stated to seek His bounty. %0D%0A%0D%0AThe brief meaning of ?Taqdeer? is that Allah always knows any good or bad which takes place in the universe before it happens and Allah Ta?ala creates it in accordance. Also all actions of people are manifest from the will of Allah, (fate, thaqdeer). But one have been given the freedom of choice in his%2Fher actions. If he chooses a good deed he will gain reward, and on the contrary if he chooses bad deed then he will gain punishment. When one intends to do a deed, then Allah favours him with the power or ability to do so, therefore he has a choice either to use this ability in a good deed and gain reward or spend it in a bad deed to become worthy of punishment. %0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore it depends upon this very power and ability which can make one undergo hardship in shariah (depending on the choice). %0D%0A%0D%0AOne should not go too deep into thaqdeer it can cause one to be misled and simultaneously there is no benefit to it. This is why our beloved Nabi (S) has dissuaded us from its discussion.%0D%0A%0D%0AAlso remember that Allah has sent us into this world for a test! To see if his creation will recognize Him the Al-Razzaq. One may be trying his utmost to open a business but for some reason he keeps failing in doing so. Why? Maybe Allah wants his slave to turn to Him and ask for help. This may be the means for him to recognize his Lord. Or Allah may be testing to see if he chooses patience and still praises%2F thanks Allah, rather than loosing hope. Or it could be that Allah may intend for this persons status in jannat to become higher by making him undergo such difficulty.%0D%0A%0D%0AMany times we tend to forget our Lord. The only time we turn to him is when we need help, and when we come to realize there is no one else who we can turn to but Him. One should keep in mind that there is a ?maslihat? (expedience) behind everything.%0D%0A%0D%0A3) Our intentions should always be to seek the pleasure of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0A4) There are some ways which can expand ones rizq: -by giving zakat, - silah rehmi ( keeping ties with people) - earning money in a halaal way -stay away from bidat%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
