  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs there a time limit of when you have to consumate/have sexÂ from the time of your nikah? Please provide relegious evidence on this matter.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThere is no time limit to consummate the marriage after the Nikah.\n\nIf the spouses are together, then there should be no reason not to consummate the marriage.\n\nIt is however understandable if they are apart for example in different countries and cannot consummate the marriage.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
