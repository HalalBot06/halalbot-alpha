What happens to Muslims who dont pay all their taxes,is this a sin?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf we state that the Tabligh Jamat is not the product of the CIA and not founded by the British, which is true, those that make the claim will not believe us. If we state that the Tabligh Jamaat is the product of CIA and funded by the British, which is false, then we are guilty of falsehood.%0D%0A%0D%0AIdeally, those that make such allegations, should support their claim. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?It is upon the claimant to substantiate.? (Tirmidhi). We challege anyone who has any proof supporting the allegationsto forward to us.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe purpose of the Tabligh Jamaat (propagating good and conscientising people to be obedient to Allah) is set up by Allah. He ordered all his prophets to carry out that talk and promised to assist them in every way in this world with great rewards in the hereafter. If this was the agenda of the CIA and funded by the British, the world would be heaven on earth. That day will come come, Insha Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0AMuslims residing in a Muslim country should abide by the laws of that country which are not un-Islamic.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
