  "question": "Permissibility of travellling to a foreign non-muslim country for dawah related work.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalam aliekum? I want to go to my country of origin (non-muslim country) to help my muslim brothers in dawah related work. My wife is hesitant in going as she feels uncomfortable in new surroundings and does not like the idea of having to learn a new language and build up her professional work (she is mashallah doing well currently in the UK). There are 1.5 million muslims in the UK and allhamdolillah many people and organisations working for Islam. In my country there are no more than 100,000 muslims where English is not the main language. I feel a need to translate and create work catered for the country so that Islam can reach that part of the Europe as well. Please advice in the light of Quran and Sunnah on the permissibility of me making an informed decision on my wife's behalf with regards to traveling abroad as I do not wish to violate her wishes and rights she may have in this matter. W'salam Tayyab\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe matter at hand is not one where we can give you a direct ruling\nsanctioning your taking her to a foreign country or not.\n\nWhen making a decision, it will be necessary to bear in mind that causing\nharm or grief to her as a result of taking her to a strange land is not\npermissible. Similarly, at the time of your marriage if it was stipulated\nor understood that you would live with her in the U.K and not live overseas,\nthen too it would be wrong to force her to leave.\n\nInstead of forcing your will onto her, try to reach a compromise. Maybe, you\ncould agree to go to your country for a few years, or at least return to the\nU.K regularly in the case of her family being there. You would find it much\nmore fruitful to make a decision with her than to make on for her.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
