  "question": "Is downloading books free would be allowed in Islam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThere is a website www.ebooksclub.org which offers free ebooks. the downloads are totally free. I just wanted to know whether downloading books free would be allowed in Islam since i am not sure whether any rules are being broken.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nIf the website offers you to download e books for free, then it will be permissible for you to do so. I have read through the Terms & Rules page, and it does not mention anything about the legality of downloading e books. However, after visiting the site, the only service I saw they were offering is reviews of books.\n\nAnd Allah knows best \n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
