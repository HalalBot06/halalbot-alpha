  "answer": "QUESTION\n1.Regarding the Math-thabs.I believe in one Ummah, but unfortunately we are already divided.I feel that by sticking to a single math-thab,this only creates more divisions.You say,by choosing different math-thabs for things is disobedience to Allah.I read a hadith the other day:bukhari:narrated by Abu Huraira:\"Religion is very easy and whoever overburdens himself in his religion will not be able to continue in that way.So you should not be extremists...\" I do not have the knowledge to interpet this, but by sticking to one math-thab for all things, when something else is easier for you in another math-thab, i feel that one will be overburdened? Afterall, as you said all the math-thabs are correct? I agree! Just sometimes it becomes overburdening to follow one math-thab as such. 2.i dont understand, how the Ummah is to progress and compete with those against us,if something as vital as dead body dissection is prohibited? Even with modern technology a surgeon needs to know what he is operating on before opening up the body! After all knowledge is vital, and we need to treat the Ummah and humans in general, or watch those against us up and healthy? Afterall, what is a body to Allah (SWT)? He may create another one as He wishes! It isn't mutilation as such, for its something Muslims, and the world, needs for survival. 3.Difference in watching a tv lecture and the camera is only on the speaker start to finish,compared to sitting in a lecture theatre that has been segregated?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Adhering to one Madhab is clearly more easy that selecting from various Madhaahib. If you select from all over the show, you will be adhering to your Nafs (base desires) instead of the Madhab.\n\n2. Imagine if the corpse being dissected for medical purposes is the corpse of your love one. Would you be happy with this? Obviously, you wouldn?t. then why would you condone it for someone else?s loved one?\n\n3. The prohibition of television is not merely because of the content but also because of the picture-making process. So, irrespective of what is viewed on the screen, it is still prohibited.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
