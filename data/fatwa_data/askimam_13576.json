  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy grandfather recently died in Bangladesh. He has left my grandmother. I am aware that a period of Iddah of 4 months and 10 days is to be enforced according to the Sharia. My question is that is my grandmother allowed to come to the UK during this period? Most of her family lives here in the UK (3 daughters and their husbands, 2 sons and their wives and 16 grandchildren). In Bangladesh, she has no means of income except a small pension, as my grandfather has died. She has 3 daughters in Bangladesh, but they cannot support her as they are all quite poor, and one even has cancer. She won't be able to survive very well in Bangladesh. However, in the UK, her 2 sons and 3 daughters and several grandchildren are reasonably financially well off (alhamdulillah) and we will be able to support her here in the UK. In light of this, can my grandmother travel to the UK during this 4 months and 10 days of mourning (obviously the Sharia conditions of traveling will be met, as my grandmother will be accompanied by her son on the flight)? Please answer soon, as an anwer is required very urgently. JazakAllah mufti saheb, your assistance is most appreciated.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to Shariah, a woman whose husband has passed away should observe the Iddah at her husband's house. You state that your grandmother has three daughters in the same country. If it possible that the family from the UK offer some financial help for your grandmother during the Iddah period, then they should do so. Thereafter, once the Iddah has completed your grandmother may move over to the UK.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
