  "answer": "QUESTION\npeople argue that since we are aslo using the car therefore the extra money charged by the banks is there to compensate for the depriciation.Is this correct? If not how does Islam carters to the depriciation of item??\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. This is merely another excuse for legalising interest. The extra money conventional banks charge for property or vehicle finance is interest. Yes, if the financing is carried out in a Shari?ah-compliant manner, such a financing scheme is permissible.\n\n2. Coming back to the argument of ?depreciation?, what would they say in the case of financing of a fixed property which, in fact, appreciates in value? Would the banks then pay out the consumer for this appreciation? Obviously, their argument holds no water.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
