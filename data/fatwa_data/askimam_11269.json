  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is no Iddat (waiting period) after birth like in divorce and death.\n\nHowever, the maximum period of Nifaas (bleeding after birth) is 40 days. It\nis not necessary for a woman after birth to sit for 40 days in the confines\nof her home. However, she should take care of her health after birth.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
