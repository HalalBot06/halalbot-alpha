  "question": "My brother wants to marry a girl who cant bear children. She can only bear if someone donates her a ovary, which means its wont be her child. Is this allowed in Islam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe procedure requires the doning of an egg of another woman which may be fertilised in the recipient woman in a test tube. The entire process of fertilisation is questionable as to its permissibility.\n\nThereafter, the question of family lineage, responsibility of nurturing, inheritance, marriage, etc. are raised. In light of the outcome of these repercussions of ovary donation, this practise would be termed as non-permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
