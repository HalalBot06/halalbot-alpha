  "question": "What does the Qur’an have to say about mortgage?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy family and i live in canada, here we are renting a house for which we pay 1600 $ for rent. If we own a house here it would be on mortgage and we would be paying less we would be paying for our own house. We have abstain from interest and unlawful money from the beginning but most ulama here have said that 1 house on mortgage is fine. We wanted to confirm this thing what does Qur'an says about such matter?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu `alaykumwa-rahmatullāhiwa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\nMortgage referred to in North America is interest and is explicitly prohibited in the Qura’an.\n\n \n\nAllah (Subhanahu wa Ta’ala) says:\n\n \n\nو احل الله البيع و حرم الربوا\n\n \n\nTranslation: “And Allah has permitted sale and prohibited interest/usury” (Surah Al- Baqarah,275/2)\n\n \n\nAllah (Subhanahu wa Ta’ala) says:\n\n \n\n                              فان لم  اتقوا  الله و ذروا ما بقي من الربوا ان كنتم مؤمنين\n\nتفعلوا فاذنوا بحرب من الله و رسوله\n\n \n\nTranslation: “Fear Allah and leave out the remains of interest, if you are true believers.If you do not do so, then let it be an announcement of war between Allah and his messenger”(Surah Al-Baqarah, 278-9/2)\n\n \n\nAllah (Subhanahu wa Ta’ala) says:\n\n \n\nيا ايها اللذين امنوا لا تاكلوا الربوا اضعافا مضافعة\n\n \n\nTranslation: “Oh you who believe! Do not consume interest compounded over and over” (Surah Aale- Imraan, 130/3)\n\n \n\nThe Ahadeeth of Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) explicitly prohibit interest/usury.\n\n \n\nRasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said:\n\n \n\nعن ابي هريرة قال قال رسول الله صلي الله عليه و سلم الذهب بالذهب وزنا بوزن مثلا بمثل و الفضة بالفضة وزنا بوزن مثلا بمثل فمن زاد او استزاد فهو ربوا\n\n \n\nTranslation:“It is narrated on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (radhiyallahu anhu) that Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said: Exchange gold for gold on equal weight equivalently and exchange silver for silver on equal weight equivalently, whosoever increases or seeks an increase, then it is usury/interest’’ (Saheeh Muslim, 25/2, Qadeemi Kutub Khana, Karachi)\n\n \n\nRasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said:\n\n \n\nو عن علي انه سمع رسول الله صلي الله عليه و سلم لعن اكل الربوا و موكله و كاتبه و مانع الصدقة و كان ينهي عن النوح\n\n \n\nTranslation: “It is reported on the authority of Ali (Radhiyallahu anhu) that he heard Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) cursed the one who consumes interest, deals in interest, records interest, abstains from paying Zakaat (alms) and he used to prohibit excessive mourning” (Mishkaatul – Masaabeeh, 2829)\n\n \n\nRasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said:\n\n \n\nعن عبد الله بن حنظلة غسيل الملاءكة قال قال رسول الله صلي الله عليه و سلم درهم ربا ياكله الرجل و هو يعلم اشد من ستة و ثلاثين زنية\n\nTranslation: “It is narrated on the authority of Abdullah Bin Hanzalah that Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) said: One dirham of interest/usury which a man consumes while he is aware (of it being interest), is more severe than thirty three counts of adultery” (Mishkaatul – Masaabeeh, 2825)\n\n \n\nIt is clear from the above that interest is haraam (forbidden). The rationale explained by you that the monthly payment towards the mortgage is lesser than paying rental and finally owning the house has no justification in Shariah.\n\n \n\nPaying interest is prohibited. Paying rental is permissible.\n\n \n\nYour need for a house is fulfilled through renting a house.\n\n \n\nAs Muslims, we focus on what is the law of Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta’ala) and his Rasul (Sallallahu ualayhi wasallam).Any logic contrary to that is shunned. However, be rest assured, following the Shariah comes with barakah. Violating the Shariah, incurs the wrath of Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta’ala) which is exemplified in various aspects of a person’s life.\n\n \n\nShould you wish to purchase a house, we would advise you to search for Islamic Finance alternatives within your country.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best.\n\n \n\nIsmail Desai,\n\nDurban, South Africa\n\nStudent DarulIftaa\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\ndaruliftaa.net"
