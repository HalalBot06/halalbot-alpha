  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalamu-alaikum Mufti Sahab, in replying to azaan should we say \"(sallahu alahai wasallam) \" while replying to \"Ashadu Anna Muhammed ar Rasoolullah\" are we supposed to say (sallahu alahai wasallam) ...one mufti here calls it makroof..one calls it bidah and third calls it mustahabb b) is the hadith that mentions replying back to \"Qadqamatis Salah\" unauthentic?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. According to the narrators of Hadith, we are supposed to repeat the exact\nwords of the Muazzin except for 'Hayya alas Salaah' and 'Hayya alal Falaah'.\nThere is no mention of saying the words, 'Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam'.\nHowever, if one does so, without thinking it to be necessary, then we do not\nsee any harm in it.\n2. This Hadith is recorded by Imaam Abu Dawud in his Sunah, Hadith529. The\nchain of narrators have been classified as weak. (Mukhtasar al-Munzhiri\nvol.1 pg.285). However, such a Hadith can be used to establish Istihbaab?\nThe fact that it is weak does not necessitate its total rejection.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
