  "question": "till what age does a husband have to go her wife for her needs in shariah. If a man doen't want to go to his barren and above 52 years of age wife for sexual needs ...",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf a man doen't want to go to his barren and above 52 years of age wife for sexual needs will he be sinning according to shariah, till what time does he have to go, if he does'nt want to spend any night of the week with her but only with ther yonger wife and is fulfilling rest of her needs equally, what then is he free not to spend any night with ther.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, according to Shari?ah if a person has more than one wife then he has to exercise equality between them in all those aspects which are in his control and also equality in the number of days spent between them. However, with regards to those aspects which a person has no control over, e.g. amount of love he has, sexual relations, etc. equality is not necessary. (Aalamgiri vol.1 pg.340)\n\nHowever, if one of the wives happily agree to forego her rights, then this will also be permissible. (Ibid)\n\nIt should also be borne in mind that both those women are his wives and have desires which ought to be fulfilled. It is her due right that her husband satisfies her sexual desires as well.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
