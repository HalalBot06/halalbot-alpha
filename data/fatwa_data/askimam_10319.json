  "question": "Is it permitted to have any sort of economic activity in the mosque?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have heard in the past that to advertise your business or to have any sort of commercial activity within the mosque is not permitted. Can you clarify whether this is the case or not. As a follow up, what if I were to advertise a business in a local islamic magazine which was distributed inside the mosque? Would this be permitted?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is prohibited to engage in any commercial activity in the Musjid. The only exception is for a person sitting in I?tikaaf during Ramadhaan. If there is no one to carry out his commercial activity, then he may conduct his commercial activity in the Musjid without bringing the merchandise into the Musjid.\n\nThe Islamic magazine carrying business adverts may be distributed out of the actual Musjid, for example, in the Sahn area or entrance hall, etc.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
