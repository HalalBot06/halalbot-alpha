  "question": "When removing the pubic hairs exactly what must be removed?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nOnly below the navel or on the private part also?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe area immediately under the navel is not to be shaven.\n\nThe area of shaving for a person (male / female) is above and around the\nprivate parts. If possible, it is commendable to shave around the hind\nprivate parts as well. (Al-Kaamil, commentary of Muslim; Imaam Nawawi vol. 1\npg. 128).\n\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
