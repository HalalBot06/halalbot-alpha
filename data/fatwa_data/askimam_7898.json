  "answer": "QUESTION\nAfter the body of the deceased is given a Ghusl, the body lies most probably in a room and generally the women- folk read for the muhroom. What happens thereafter, on a very frequent occurence is that people, either males or females, request to view the face. I find that very annoying as this is the time to read and give extra Esaale Sawaab for the muheoom and not to worry about viewing the face. Please could you advise as to the Islamic Law pertaining to viewing the deceased's face.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, it is Makrooh (disliked) to delay the Janaaza Sakaat. (Shaami vol.3 pg.232; HM Saeed)\n\nAfter the Ghusl has been made the Janaaza Salaat should be performed as quickly as possible. Secondly, it is Haraam for strange males and females to see the face of the opposite gender even though after the person has passed away. Therefore, the custom of viewing the face and delaying the Janaaza should be discouraged. However, death in a family is a delicate situation, this discouragement of the custom should be done with a lot of wisdom and diplomacy.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
