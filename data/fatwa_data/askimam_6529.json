  "answer": "QUESTION\n1.Once I had a little cut in my toe. When I started my isha namaaz there was no blood on it, but when I finished my namaaz. I noticed that there was blood on the bandage, which means my wudu broke. But I don?t know when the blood came out and got on the bandage. So should I repeat my whole isha namaaz to be on the safe side? 2. If a women?s period start when she?s in fard salaat, then she don?t have to make qadha of it. But if it starts when in Sunnah or Nafl salaat, she has to make qadha of it. SoI don?t remember in wh my question is my periods started when I was doing my isha salat. But at rakaat it started.
