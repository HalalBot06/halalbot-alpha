  "question": "Isnâ€™t it essential that we must celebrate and be happy on the birthday of our Beloved Prophet (saw)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAllah swt states in the Holy Quran ?Of the favour and mercy of Allah let them rejoice, that is better than all their wealth? 10:58. This verse Allah orders us to rejoice in his favours and mercy. Also in the Quran we are reminded ?spend not wastefully (your wealth), in the manner of a spendthrift, verily the spendthrift are the brothers of the devils? 15:26. Although Allah is normally fond of simplicity, from the above verse stating ?let them rejoice, that is better than all their wealth? 10:58 we can say it is a divine commandment of Allah to rejoice and celebrate the favours and mercy that He has bestowed upon us and spending one?s finances in such a way will be considered by Allah more important than all savings. So what are favours and mercy of Allah? The Holy Quran provides answer 2:64 The Prophet SAW is the ONLY blessing of Allah that He describes with the word ?favour?. What exactly is Allah swt?s mercy? The Holy Quran states: ? And we have sent you (Muhammad) except as a mercy to mankind? 21:107. This shows the Holy Prophet?s SAW distinctive quality incarnate in both word and deed. The Prophet SAW also described himself so eloquently and concisely when he said, ?I am a mercy bestowed by Allah.? Allah states in the Holy Quran, ?Of the favour and mercy of Allah let them rejoice, that is better than all their wealth? 10:58. Therefore, according to Quranic teachings, isn?t it essential that we must celebrate and be happy on the birthday of our Beloved Prophet SAW?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt suffices to state that the four famous Imaams and traditional scholars, viz. Imaam Abu Hanifa, Imaam Shaafi?ee, Imaamm Maaliki and Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, regard the celebration of Meelaad as impermissible.\n\nThe abovementioned Imaams were great traditional scholars and masters in every field of Islam. No latter scholar?s views can be equated to the views of these great Imaams. One may go one step beyond the four Imaams, the era of the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum). They loved the prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) but never did they celebrate Meelaad. In fact, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) never celebrated his own birth or instructed anyone to do so.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
