  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs Salaam Aalekum There has been an instance when a friend of mine made a very insulting joke about Allah.I did not realize the implication and started laughing . However after I had realized a thought entered my mind that I should not show them that I am feeling bad.Therefore I purposefully stood there witha forced smile.Later on when someone asked me whether I felt bad I said No. I have now realized the foolishness and immaturity of my act and have seeked Taubah from Allah.However I wanted to know whether I should also remind those persons about the insult and tell them that I felt bad. Actually it has been a long time and they will not remember it. Therefore this might not have the desired effectand they might even think me to be mad.Moreover thru my later actions I have shown that I am religious.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf you are certain that this reminder will make them repent from such\nstatements, you may remind them.\n\nIf you feel that it would lead to even further foolish remarks, you may as\nwell abstain and use other methods of persuasion.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
