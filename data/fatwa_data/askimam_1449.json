  "question": "Can you rent or sell a business to non-muslims when they might use it to sell pork or alcohol?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe borrowed $60,000 from my husband's brother to buy a halal pizza place and it is going down hill. We can't pay him off. If we sell it, it will be sold for less $ because it is not worth as much. The Muslims that sold it to us lied and said it made a LOT of money when it didn't. How do we pay off this debt? We even have credit card debt of about $8,000 from when we were not following Islam a few years back. Help please. We want to do the right thing. We are living conservatively as it is.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe advise you sell the business to anyone Muslim or non-Muslim. You will not\nbe responsible for anything un-Islamic committed by the new non-Muslim\nowner.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
