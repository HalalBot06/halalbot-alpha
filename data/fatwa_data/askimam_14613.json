  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs -Salam-Alikum\n\n1. Are we allowed to fould our pants in Namaz if it goes beyond the ankle. Will Namaz be accepted.\nis this right that Prophet  (sallallaahu 'alaihi wasallam) forbade praying with folded clothes.(This is as per Sahi Muslim).\n\nI came to know from the below mentioned link\n\nhttp://qss.org/articles/errors/errors.html#RTFToC2\n\n2.If the person who is leading the salah is offering Magrib Salah & he has missed Zohar salah can he lead the Jamat or first he need to offer Zohar salah.\n\n3. In Hanafi Madhab can a husband wife offer Salah by Jamat.\n\nThanks\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\n \n\n1)      It is permissible to fold your pants before salat, not during salat because this will be classed as aml katheer which is forbidden during salat. It will also render your salaat invalid.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2)      If the imam is a sahib tarteeb (person who has less than 5 namaz qaza) then it is necessary for him to first pray his zohar then offer other prayers but if he is not a sahib-e-tarteeb then it is not necessary for him to perform zohar salat before he prays any other salat.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3)      In Hanfi madhab it is permissible to pray in jama’at with the condition that the wife/female is not standing next to the husband/male during salat. If this happens then the male’s salaat will be invalid..\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
