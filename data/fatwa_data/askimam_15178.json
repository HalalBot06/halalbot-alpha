  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) If exceptionnaly I have to pray dhuhr prayer very late at home, should I pray the 4 rakaa't sunnah mu'akadah BEFORE or AFTER the fardh in my case where I am late because I thought fardh should be made first because of its importance? And generally, what is the limit where I can pray the 4 sunnat before farz?\n\n\n2) I have exams coming and I make du'a after every salah and also recite rabbi inni maghluban fantassir along with my own efforts but I would like you to keep me in your du'as respected mufti.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf there is sufficient time before the expiry time of Zuhar salah and you could perform you sunnat salah with your fardh salah, the you should perform your four rakaats sunnah before the fardh salah.\nMay Allah make you successful in your exams, Ameen.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
