  "question": "How can we apropriately stop a person from doing bidat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBidat is a great sin. According to the hadith, bidat is mardood (no-good%2F useless) it is gumrahi (deceiving) sharrul umoor (evil order); it is the means of the curse of Allah, and Rasul (S), and the Angels and people. One who honors a bidati (person doing bidat) is cursed. A bidati?s fast is not accepted, nor his namaz, hajj, umrah, sadqah, jihad, in fact if he does not stop from doing bidat, then he is deprived of repentance. %0D%0A%0D%0ABidat is so great a sin that from its evil influence the sunnat is wiped away and that tribe (involved in bidat) is deprived from the noor of the sunnat of our beloved Nabi (S). In the hadith Rasulullah (S) has said that any nation who initiates a bidat, is deprived of that equivalent sunnat. Keep firm on my sunnat, it is better than creating a bidat. [FATAWA RAHIMIYA PAGE 341 vol.10]%0D%0A%0D%0ABidat causes great harm to a sunnat. Bidat takes the place of a sunnat. And finally it wipes away the sunnat.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou can understand this through the following example: a farmer grows crops. The farmer fertilizes his crops so that the rice or wheat may grow. In between the crops some weeds and grass also begin to grow. The more these weeds grow, the more the harm and damage to the crops. In order to protect the crops, these weeds must be pulled out directly from the roots otherwise it will use up the fertilizer. Thereafter the crops will flourish and thrive. If the weeds are not pulled out, then harm will overcome the crops.%0D%0A%0D%0ASimilar is the situation of bidat. Bidat resembles the weeds and grass which prevents the sunnat from flourishing. It overshadows the sunnat. If bidat is not pointed out from the start and the ummat (nation) is not warned and stopped then in the end bidat overpowers and takes the place of the sunnat, concluded by demolishing the sunnat away.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn a hadith it has been stated by Nabi (S) that who so ever will protect my sunnat then Allah taalah will show his respect%2F honor in 4 things %0D%0A(1) He will be loved by the pious ones [Allah will create his love in the hearts of the pious] %0D%0A(2) Allah will put his awe and fear into the hearts of the fajir (sinful person) and badkar (immoral%2F corrupted people)%0D%0A(3) His rizq (subsistence) will be increased%0D%0A(4) He will have firmness in deen (religion)%0D%0A[FATAWA RAHEEMIYA PAGE 77 vol.8]%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Anas (R) has narrated that Rasoolullah (S) has said ?and whosoever loved my sunnat (meaning acted upon my sunnat) then he has loved me and whosoever will love me, will be with me in paradise? [Tirmizi, Mishkaat page 30]%0D%0AHazrat Abu Hurairah (R) has narrated that Nabi (S) has said whosoever amongst my nation holds tightly upon one of my sunnats (and acts upon it) at a time of fasaad (tumult %2F dissension%2F disorder%2F disturbance) then for him is the reward of 100 martyrs! [Miskaat page 30] Fatawa Rahimiya Pg. 386 vol.10%0D%0A%0D%0AHasan Basri (R) says if you wish that it does not take you long on the pul sirat (bridge over Jahannum) and you go straigt to Jannat, do not create something new from your own opinion in Allah?s deen. He further says do not sit with bidati, for they will make your heart ill.%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Imam Auzaai (ra) says do not converse with a bidati, nor debate and argue with them, for there is fear that they will put a seed of fitna into your heart. Hazrat imam shuabi thabi (R) says that the time is near when those people will appear who will say new things from there own thoughts and the result of this will be that islam will shatter.%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Hassan bin Athiya (R) says there will be no nation which will create a bidat but Allah will surely take away that much of the sunnat from them and until Qiyamat that sunnat will not return to them.%0D%0A%0D%0AA man came to Hazrat Abdullah ibn umar (R) and said so and so a person is sending you salaam. In return he replied I have been told that this person has commenced a bidat, so if this is actually true that he has commenced a bidat then do not give him my salaam.%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Huzifa (R) says that in the future bidat will spread in such a way that if a person says stop this bidat then they will reply he has stopped a sunnat.%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Imam Malik (R) says that whosoever commences a bidat and thinks it is something good he actually claims that Rasulullah (S) is an embezzler in sending the message (that he has done khiyanat in sending the message). Because Allah has said in the Quran ?today we have completed the deen upon you?, therefore what ever was not deen in that era can never be deen. (Alithisaam , vol.1, page 371 and vol.2 page 150) %0D%0A%0D%0A[bidat or ahle bidat written by allama khalid mehmud sahib] %0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Sufiyan Thawri (R) says that shaitan (iblees) likes bidat more than sin, for sin is known and one may repent on that. But bidat is so misleading that repentance is not done from it because (the bidat when doing it) is not known as a sin to him. %0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Sufiyan Thawri (R) also states a saying is not right unless it was put in action and no saying, action, and intention is straight unless it is according to the sunnat. %0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Sufiyan (R) also says one who hears a bidati should not say it to his friends because to say it is Risky and dangerous. [bidat or ahle bidat written by allama khalid mehmud sahib]%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Laith bin Saad (R) says that if I see a bidati walking on water, even then I would not accept him. When imam shafi heard this saying then Hazrat imam shafi (R) said you have said something small, infact if I see a bidati flying in the air, I would still never accept him. And he says further that whosoever invented a new thing and that is against the Quran, sunnat, or the qoul (saying) and fial (actions) of the sahabah, and against the ijmaa then it is ?dhalalat? a deviation from the right path (going astray).
