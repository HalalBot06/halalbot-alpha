  "question": "Can you explain the Ibadi Sect that is the national mazhab in Oman? I am with the Tablighi Jamaat. There are quite a few tombs claimed to be masjids especially in India, how will perform salaat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am getting prepared to go on 4 months with the Tablighi Jamaat, Inshallah. They say that we go to Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. I am aware that there are quite a few tombs claimed to be masjids especially in India. I am worried that I may be tashkeled to one of these places and they will expect me to pray my salah in one of these places. I understand that it is haraam to do so and is shirk it is also sad that the ummah still adopts this practice of pagans and kaafir. Anyway can you give me some advice on what to do if and when I am confronted with this sort of situation? I have asked you a few questions the last few weeks I am just wondering in you have received them? Thank you for clearing up the Abdul Wahhab issue on your website sadly brothers are spreading lies about a pious sheikh.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour Tashkeel (plan) to be sent to different parts in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh will be done by the seniors of Tabligh Jamaat who are great scholars (Ulama). They are well aware of the injunctions of the Shari?ah. Be rest assured you will not be sent to commit Kufr and Shirk but to train yourself to be an upright and practicing Muslim.\n\nYour sacrifice will then be a means of guidance for the Ummah and removing people from Kufr and Shirk. It is possible that you will be sent to places where many un-Islamic practices take place, for example, worshipping graves, etc. When you go to such places, you will perform your Salaat for Allah and not for anyone else. That is not Shirk.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
