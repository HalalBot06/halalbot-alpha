To say a lie hadith is a great sin but if a person reads a certain hadith in a book or hears from some one and he is not aware of is it a lie hadith or not. Then if it is a lie hadith and he/she says that hadith to anyone and he/she is not aware of that then will he/she be sunful.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHadhrat Hasan Basri (RA) advised, 'Verily this knowledge (of Islam) is Deen,\nso becareful from who you seek your Deen.' (Mishkaat)\n\nIn view of the above advise, one should exercise precaution from who he/she\nis seeking Hadith. Hadith should be taken from a reliable scholar of Hadith.\nA book of Hadith must be studied under the supervision and guidance of a\nscholar of Hadith.
