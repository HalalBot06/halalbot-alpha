  "question": "What is the ruling regarding a Muslimcalling another Muslim rude for questioning a non-believer?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nA non-believer said he was a journalist and asked our list our opinion of the situation in the Philippines. I questioned his credentials and was told that I was rude for doing so. Is it wrong of me to feel insulted and humiliated by my brothers and sisters since they defended a non-believer? Are there any Hadiths pertaining to this? I am really embarrassed and unsure of how I should respond.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen a journalist requires information from Muslims on Islam or matters relating to Muslims, they should exercise precaution as journalists are known for misrepresentation of facts.\n\nOften, they have their own agenda and advance their cause. Therefore, it was correct for you to question the journalist. It was cautious of you to do so and not rude.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
