  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n\nI took some loan on wedding of my sister of about 4 lakhs. Right now i have to pay about 2.5 lakhs. I have a monthly salary of about 60,000 / month. and from this amount i give some part of it in terms of refunding loan. i didn't take the loan from any bank. i took it from my some relatives and some friends. I want to ask you that\n \" Is it necessary for me to do QURBANI\".\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf after deducting the remaining debt amount from your assets, the remaining wealth equals or exceeds the amount of Nisāb (200 Dirhams or equivalent value), you will have to sacrifice an animal for Qurbāni. The amount considered as part of your assets and estate includes your cash savings as well as all valuables that you own which are over and above your basic needs and necessities. If after deducting the remaining loan amount from your entire estate, the remaining wealth is less than the Nisāb amount, you will not have to offer a sacrifice.\n\n \n\nو أما شرائطها فهي ثلاثة * أولها الغني و الغني فيها هو من له مائتا درهم أو عرض يساوي مائتي درهم سوى مسكنه و خادمه و ثيابه التي يلبسها و أثاث البيت فالغني في الأضحية ما هو الغني في صدقة الفقر (الفتاوى الخانية ج 4 ص 328 حقانية)\n\n \n\nوَهِيَ وَاجِبَةٌ عَلَى الْحُرِّ الْمُسْلِمِ الْمَالِكِ لِمِقْدَارِ النِّصَابِ فَاضِلًا عَنْ حَوَائِجِهِ الْأَصْلِيَّةِ كَذَا فِي الِاخْتِيَارِ شَرْحِ الْمُخْتَارِ (الفتاوى الهندية ج 1 ص 191 الفتاوى رشيدية)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nMl.
