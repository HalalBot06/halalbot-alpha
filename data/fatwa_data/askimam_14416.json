  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni was wondering if it is okay to work at a shop which someone owned through haraam money . will it be okay to work at the shop because it is your own hard work which is getting the money so you are earning it. Is this right or wrong to work at that shop?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf the shop owner acquired the shop through, at least, 51% Halaal means, then it is permissible for you to work there and your income will be Halaal. If the shop was acquired through, at least, 51% Haraam means, then you should not work there.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
