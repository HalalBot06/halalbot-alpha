  "question": "Please differentiate between disapproving the attacks against the US and approving of attacks against Israel.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn reading answers to previous questions, you mentioned that the attacks against the US are not justified because among other things they killed women (and children). However, you also mentioned the attacks against the Israeli occupation of Palestine are justified because( among other things) it is the lesser of two evils. Is this saying that those laws which say the US attacks were wrong does not apply because of what Israel is doing? If that is the case, being that the US is helping Israel with the occupation of our land( and that cant be argued ) why are the laws also not compromised to let us kill Americans? Please give me an exact difference. Also, if Allah wants us to hate Jews and we are \"better\" than them, why did Allah let them ovecome all the Islam states and the Palestinains in the wars of '48 and '67 abnd let them occupy Palestine?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is a difference between the US situation and the Palestinian\nsituation. The land in the US does not belong to Muslims, whereas Palestine\nbelongs to us.\n\nThe Jews have occupied our land and the whole territory has become a\nWarfield. That is not so in the US. The implications of being in a Warfield\nis different from that land which is not a Warfield.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
