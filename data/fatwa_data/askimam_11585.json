  "answer": "QUESTION\nI work as a web designer. This profession involves the displaying of human images (male, female) and insertion of music and sound loops in websites. Now as a profession, I want to know if the money i earn from this source is haraam or halal? I've spoken to few people and they told me, the least rank of thought is to make sure that I'm not involved in 'making' those images and music. I only take sources given by my clients and in some cases take existing sources available on the internet and display them. So, please let me know of this issue. Jazakalah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for you to display images of human beings and insert\nmusic and sound loops on websites. This is assisting in sin. Allah Ta'ala\nstates, 'And do not assist in sin.' (Maaidah)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
