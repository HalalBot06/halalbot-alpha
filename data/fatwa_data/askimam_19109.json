  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissible to buy new items during the month of Muharram? I have to buy some new furniture items since I have moved to a new place.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nThere is nothing in the Shariah that prohibits buying new items in the month of Muharram. Therefore, it is permissible to buy new items in the month of Muharram, just as it permissible to buy new items in other months.\n\n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMl.
