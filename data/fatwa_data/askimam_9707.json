  "answer": "QUESTION\nI don't want my parents to so in order to do nikkah how many withness do i need Does the withness have to be male Also i'm the girl.Also can the withness be a friend? jaza kahallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, an adult female has an independent choice to get married. She does not require the consent of her guardian, for example, father for the validity of her marriage.%0D%0A%0D%0AA Nikah is performed with a proposal (Iejaab) by the male or female and acceptance (Qubool) by the male or female in the past tense and in the presence of two male Muslim witnesses (Hidaaya vol. 2).%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is Sunnat that the marriage be announced and performed in the Masjid and the bride be represented by her Mahram (father, brother, etc.). The bride gives consent to her representative (Wakeel) in the presence of two witnesses to perform her marriage at the Masjid. At the Masjid, the Wakeel represents the bride in the presence of the two witnesses and the stipulated dowry. The witnesses must be two trustworthy and pious male Muslims who are not her ascendants e.g. father, grandfather or decendants e.g. son, grandson, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Mahr (dowry) is the woman's right and should be stipulated prior to the marriage.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is our advice that you discuss the matter with your parents and make them part of your decision making process. Their advice and guidance for you will be motivated by their love for you.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
