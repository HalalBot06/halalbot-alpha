  "question": "I might go to prison and havent told my parents. Please give me a Dua to read",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMufti sahib, I am in a lot of trouble with the law here and could face a prison sentence. I have not told my parents at all because they are not well and I think they will worry too much if they were to find out. Am I depriving myself of the Du'aa of my mother?, I have heard that a mother's Du'aa is always accepted. but if i tell her she will worry so much and I don’t want to put her through pain and deprive her of her sleep. what should I do in your opinion? can you please tell me some Du'aa so that i may gain the help of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. Jazak Allah.\n\nCan you please also tell me a Du'aa so I can wake up for fajr salat every morning as fajr is very early and isha is very late in the summer time. Jazak Allah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\n \n\nWe are sad to hear about your difficulty with the law. You did not state the crime you committed for us to have more insight in order to advise you. Whatever the issue is, we make dua that Allah Taala remove this difficulty from you and grant you ease and comfort. Aameen.\n\n \n\nOn one side you need your parents duas and on the other side you are concerned about their peace and health should they know of your problems. You know your problems and the possible implication on informing your parents. We suggest you identify an intelligent and mature person who knows your parents very well and someone you can trust and confide in. Talk to that person in confidence and seek his wise counsel. The person you confide in does not have to be an Aalim. He must be someone you trust and knows your family situation and can apply himself diligently in giving you appropriate advice.\n\n \n\nIn the meanwhile, turn to Allah Taala and make dua to Him to guide you to an appropriate person you can confide in. Allah Taala knows best why you are in this condition. Use this moment to ponder and reflect upon your past and remedy your present condition to enjoy a bright future. A wise person uses the experience of his past life to make appropriate decisions for the future. Allah Taala created us to worship Him and be obedient to Him. Peace and happiness comes from Allah alone. Turn to Allah and build a bond with Him. Once Allah is happy, Allah will make you happy. He will remove you from the dark moments of your life to peace and solace.\n\n \n\nPerform your five daily salah in jamaah.\n\nMake dua after every farz salaah.\n\nTake out time everyday to make some tilawat of the Quran.\n\n \n\nIn the morning and evening take out fifteen minutes to read three tasbeehat:\n\n \n\n·         One of Durood Sharief\n\n \n\nاللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ، وَعَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ، إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ، اللَّهُمَّ بَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ، وَعَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ\n\n \n\n·        The second tasbeeh of Astaghfirullah…\n\n \n\nأستغفر الله\n\n \n\n·        The third tasbeeh of Subhanallah walhamdulillah\n\n \n\nسُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَالْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ وَلَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ، وَاللَّهُ أَكْبَرُ وَلَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللَّهِ الْعَلِيِّ الْعَظِيمِ\n\n \n\nThereafter make dua to Allah Taala.\n\n \n\nAdopt all the appropriate means to straighten your record with the law and then turn to Allah for help and success.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\n \n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
