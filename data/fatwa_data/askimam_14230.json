  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nInside our Limbe Mosque interior on the wall is a big portrait exhibiting the photograph of MSJID-E- NABI. Inter-alia the photograph depicts the interior of The Masjid-E-Nabi showing the Rasul's Sword and other artefacts belonging to the Rasul, Bibi Fatima and Caliphs.\n\nSome people place flowers under this picture. Others spread their hands over this picture with purported esteem, love and reverence/respect and kiss their hands. An act of worship? No according to them, but their unflinching love and respect is expressed by this action.\n\nI have objected to this malpractice, stating that in Sura Fatiha all praise and glory is reserved for Allah alone and there is no mention anywhere in Quran or Hadith that the photograph of Masjid-E-Nabi and its contents be revered in such a manner.\n\nA Moulana from Pakistan Moulana Assanula was consulted on this issue and he responded that this act is an expression of love, rededication and devotion to the holy prophet s.a.w. I would be most gratified if you kindly decree a fatwa. Should you agree with our Moulana then I will recede my campaign and rescind further objections. In addition to your emailed Fatwa I would require a hardcopy substantiation (Letter-headed, Signed and Sealed) being airmailed at my postal address.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nLove for Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], his family and those that are connected to him as well as expression of one’s love in respect thereof is demanded of every believer. Allah is the sole legislator of this Deen and has completed and perfected this Deen through revelation unto Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. His companions [radhiallaahu anhum] were the trusted carriers and demonstration of this Deen whose actions were sanctioned by Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] himself, thereby granting them a permanent legislative valve and an authority in their own degree.\n\nTherefore, the yardstick for the acceptability of any action is it’s conformity to the dictates of the quorum and the Sunnah of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] as demonstrated by his companions [radhiallaahu anhu]. Any action not meeting these requirements which is considered as part of the prestine Shari’ah or necessary has been unequivocally declared as innovative and misguidance by Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] himself. (Raddul Muhtaar vol.2 pg.524; HM Saeed)\n\nThe act of showing reverence and love to the drawing of Musjid-e-Nabawiy [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] on a wall of a Musjid and the place of flowers in honour thereof cannot be established through any action of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], his companions or the pious predecessors [ra] thereby alluding to its innovative nature and misguidance. In the light of expressing love for Allah, Allah Himself has legislated that the mode of expression is through following the beautiful lifestyle of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has further corroborated this by declaring that the one who loves his way of life has indeed loved him. (Jaamius-Sagheer Hadith8743)\n\nFurthermore, the Musjid is a sanctified place reserved for worship as attested to by the Qur’aan which does not accommodate acts of this nature. We, therefore, advise the drawings on the wall (as mentioned in the question) are not permissible and it is necessary that they be removed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
