  "question": "Is Ghusl compulsory after oragasm?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn one of your answers I saw that Ghusl is compulsory if a woman has oragasm by using methods like finger insertion from her husband other than sexual intercourse, only if there is ejaculation. In woman, is there any chance for no ejaculation after oragasm? How can we identify whether there was ejaculation after oragasm? Since this is regarding Thahara, and also affect the salath and other prayers, I expect your answer. May Allah help you and all others behind this great service in the life here and hereafter. Also what is sharia stand on observing Shaaban 15th as Baraath?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nGenerally, orgasm is followed by ejaculation. However, it is possible that\nejaculation is suppressed during orgasm. Therefore, if a female perceives\nhaving ejaculated, then only ghusl is compulsory.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
