  "question": "1) Plz tell me that, was Shadow of Muhammad (Sallal la ho alihay wasalam) present?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) Plz tell me that, was Shadow of Muhammad (Sallal la ho alihay wasalam) present? (2) Are the 'Wali Allah' alive in there graves, and they can go any where spiritualy in this world? (2) saying that \"It is blessing of Hazrat Ghaus or etc\" is it correct? jazakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. There are no authentic narrations which show that Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] did not have a shadow. (Imdaadul Fataawa vol.2 pg.230)\n\n2. The spirits (sols) of the Awliyaa as well as those who pass away with Imaan are living. This is mentioned in the Hadith that the souls of those believers who pass away roam around in Jannah and their souls will be returned to their bodies on the day of judgment. It is incorrect to believe that the Awliyaa can go around anywhere in this world. (Tafseer ibn Katheer vol.1 pg.172; Darul Mufeed)\n\n3. To utter statetements such as ‘it is the blessing of Hazrath ghaus’, etc. is incorrect as people generally believe that Hazrath gaus is alive and present or is really blessing them which is tantamount to Shirk (polytheism). One should refrain from uttering such statements.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
