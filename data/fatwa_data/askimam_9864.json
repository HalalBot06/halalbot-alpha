  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for writing to the institute.\n\nChildren are an amaanat from Allah Ta'ala and insha'allah you will be granted this gift if it is in your taqdeer. Have you been married long and have you been to the doctor with regard to this matter? You should increase your nafl salaah and ask Allah Ta'ala in abundance to grant your duas. Do perform tahajjud salaah, increase zikr, recitation of the Holy Quran, darood shareef and istigfar frequently. Recite Allah Ta'ala's beautiful quality \"An-Naafi' \" as often as you can especially before intercourse.\n\nDo please remember that we are cannot achieve anything without Allah Ta'ala's will and we have to accept His plans for us after we have tried to seek acceptable medical assistance. May Allah Ta'ala grant you offspring, ameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n1SOCIAL DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
