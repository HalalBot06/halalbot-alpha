  "question": "Mirza Ghulam and his beliefs",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI had a discussion with a mirzae about his beliefs. He says that he believes that Holy Prophet Hazrat Muhammad S.A.W. is the last Prophet of ALLAH. His belief about mirza ghulam ahmad qadiani is that he is imam mahdi (NAUZUBILLAH) . Is he telling me true about his aqeedah or no? Please give me some authentic arguements so that i can convince him that IMAM MAHDI R.A. is still to come. Also tell me about the character of mirza qadiani.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nHazrat Imam Mehdi R.A’s description as mentioned in the book, “Islam, Jesus, Mehdi, Qadianis and doomsday” by Prof. M. Abdullah, is as follows:\n\nImam Mehdi’s name will be Mohammed son of Abdullah. His mother’s name will be Amina.\n\nImam Mehdi R.A will be a Sayyid and from the family of Sayyida Fatima radiallahu anha. He will be tall in stature, his body will be agile and he will resemble Nabi Kareem salallahu alayhi wasallam. His character will also resemble that of Rasulullah salallahu alayhi wasallam.\n\nAmong other visible characteristics he will stutter in his speech and this will cause frustration for him. In such situation he will hit his thigh as a sign of this frustration. Allah will grant him ilm e ladunni (inspired knowledge).\n\nSome Ahadith regarding Imam Mehdi R.A\n\nIbn Masood R.A narrates that Rasulullah salallahu alayhi wasallam said, “The world will not come to an end until such a time comes that a person from my family does not reign over Arabia. His name will be same as mine” (Tirmidhi)\n\nImam Abu Daood R.A mentions in his Sunan that during his reign Islam will spread throughout the world. After he emerges, he will remain alive for 7 years and will pass away at the age of 47. (Abu Dawood)\n\nAccording to Abu Saeed Al-Khudri R.A, Rasulullah salallahu alayhi wasallam said “He (Mehdi) behind whom Eesa alayhi salawaatus salaam will perform Salah will be from my progeny. (Abu Nuaaim)\n\nComparing the above narrations about Imam Mehdi R.A , his lineage and characteristics with that of Mirza Ghulam Ahmed Qadiani, a visible contrast can be seen.\n\nMaulana Manzur Ahmed Numaani says regarding the Aqeeda,\n\n“We know that initially Mirza Ghulam posed as a religious and pious scholar. Thereafter, he said that he was Imam Mehdi (the guided one). When people started following him, he claimed that he was Eesa alayhi salawatu wassalam. Lastly, he falsely claimed that had received prophethood and is now a Nabi” (Pg 3, Al Qadiani and his faith)\n\nIn every claim of his, groups of ignorant people fell under Mirza’s deception. Before his death he claimed to be a prophet and the ignorant people followed him in this deviated belief. So, if this was their belief when he passed away, how can the Mirzais (qadiani) claim that Mirza Ghulam was merely the awaited Mehdi.\n\nNo doubt that after Mirza’s death, people continued to think that he was a prophet and remained in their belief.\n\nWe produce hereunder a brief outline of Mirza Ghulam’s claims throughout his life, which should shatter the belief of any Ahmedi/Qadiani/Mirzae that Mirza Ghulam is Imam Mehdi.\n\nI. Mirza Ghulam says (Extracts from Izala-e-Auham, Roohani Khazain, vol 3 pp.114-472):\n\n1.       Holy Prophet Mohammed(pbuh) did not understand the meaning of Surah AlZilzal.\n\n2.       Other Prophets have also made mistakes and lied. (Mirza trying to justify his false statements and unfulfilled prophecies - Author)\n\n3.       Hazrath Mohammad's Revelation also turned out to be wrong.\n\n4.       Revelation did not inform Hazrath Mohammad (pbuh) about Ibne Maryam, Dajjal, … Yajoog Majoog and Daabatul Ardh.\n\n5.       Braheen-e-Ahmadiyya is referred to as the Book of God in various other books by Mirza Ghulam eg. Roohani Khazain vol.22 p.502.\n\n6.       \" 'Inna Anzalnaaho Qareeban min alQadian wa bil Haq anzalnaahu No doubt we have sent him (Mirza) near Qadian and with truth we have sent him'; . . . this revelation which has been published in Braheene Ahmadiyya as well, is clearly and loudly revealing that the name of Qadian is definitely mentioned in Quran or Hadith as a prophecy.\"\n\n7.       Names of Makkah, Madina and Qadian are mentioned with respect in Holy Quran.\n\n8.       Holy Quran is full of obscene words. {Mirza trying to justify his foul language that he used against his opponents\n\nII. Mirza Ghulam claimed that :\n\n1.       He was the second advent of Holy Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and better and superior than the first coming (Roohani Khazain vol 16 pp.272)\n\n2.       Holy Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) has come again in this world as Mirza Ghulam to propagate Islam. (Roohani Khazain vol.17 p.249)\n\n3.       Ahmadis should not differentiate between Mirza Ghulam and Hazrat Muhammad (pbuh) because \"Anyone who differentiate between me and Mustafa (pbuh) has not seen me and not recognized me.\" (Roohani Khazain vol 16 pp.171).\n\n4.       Mirza's WAHI told him : \"'Muhammadur Rasoolullah wallazeena ma'ahoo ashiddaohoo' ala alkuffar rohamao bainahum' in this Wahi God has named me Muhammad and Rasoolullah.\" (Roohani Khazain vol 18 pp.207)\n\n5.       Those who join Mirza's Jama'at becomes a SAHABI of Rasoolullah. (Roohani Khazain vol 16 pp.258-259)\n\n6.       Since Mirza Ghulam is none other than Holy Prophet Muhmmad (pbuh) himself, therefore when an Ahmadi recites KALIMA TAYYEBAH, by Muhammadur Rasoolullah he means Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani. (Kalimat al Fasl by Mirza Basheer Ahmad s/o Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani)\n\nIII. From Mirza s/o Chiragh Bibi to Jesus s/o Mary:\n\n1.       Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was the son of Chiragh Bibi but he claimed that he is Eisa Ibne Maryam. He said that at first God converted him into Maryam for two years. After two years, God made him pregnant by blowing the soul of Eisa into him; he remained pregnant for 10 months, after whcih God converted him into Eisa. This is how he became Maryam as well as Eisa ibne Maryam. (Rooahni Khazain vol 19 pp. 87-89)\n\nIV. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad claimed that:\n\n2.       He was Maseel Maseeh that is he has certain qualities which resemled like Eisa ibne Maryam (Roohani Khazain vol 1 p. 593).\n\n3.       Hazrat Eisa (pbuh) was the son of Yousuf Najjar (Roohani Khazain vol 3 pp. 254).\n\n4.       Hazrat Eisa is dead and he will not come again. (Rooahni Khazain vol.3 p.402)\n\n5.       Jesus (Hazrat Eisa) was a habitual liar, had a habit of uttering obscenities, an alcoholic, gluttunous and a wicked person, neither a pious man nor a seeker of truth, he was a proud man and a self-conceited person who claimed divinity. (Roohani Khazain vol 9 p.387, vol.11 p.289).\n\n6.       \"The fact is that Hazrat Eisa did not perform any miracles.\" (Roohani Khazain vol 11 p. 290-291)\n\n7.       \"Three grandmothers of Hazrat Eisa were FORNICATORS and PROSTITUTES, from whose blood the body of Jesus came into being.\" (Roohani Khazain 11 p.291)\n\n8.       \"Hazrat Eisa had become insane due to epilepsy.\" (Roohani Khazain vol 9 p. 417)\n\n9.       \"I wish Hazrat Eisa had not come in this world.\" (Roohani Khazain vol 9 p. 417)\n\n10.   \"I am better than Eisa ibne Maryam.\" (Roohani Khazain vol 1 p.593)\n\n11.   \"I have certain qualities resembling Jesus .....my nature and the nature of Jesus resembles so much as if two pieces of the same atom or like two seeds of the same tree.\" (Roohani Khazain vol.1 p.593)\n\nV. Mirza boasted that:\n\n1.      \"Quran is God's Book and the words of my mouth.\" (Advertisment dated 15th March 1897, Roohani Khazain vol 22 p. 87)\n\n2.      \"I believe in my WAHI as I believe in Quran and Torah.\" (Roohani Khazain vol.17 p.454)\n\n3.      \"The basis for our claim is not Hadith but Quran and that WAHI which comes to us. Yes in support we also quote those Hadith which are according to Quran and DO NOT CONTRADICT MY WAHI. As for the REST OF THE HADITHs, I THROW THEM AWAY LIKE A WASTE PAPER.\" (Roohani Khazain vol 19 p.140)\n\n4.      Bait-ul-Zikr (Mosque adjacent to Bait-ul-Fikr, the room where Mirza Ghulam used to sit and write books) is like Haram-e-Ka'aba, 'Wa man dakhalahoo kaan amina' {and whosoever enters it, is in peace}.\" (Roohani Khazain vol. 1 p.666-667)\n\n5.      Verse [17:1] of Holy Quran: 'Praise be to Allah, who took His Servant on the Night Journey from Masjid Haram to Masjid Aqsa', its real and literal application is the Mosque built by father of Mirza Ghulam. (Collection of Advertisement vol.3 p.286)\n\nVI. Mirza announced:\n\n1.       \"I am Adam , I am Noah, I am Abraham, I am Isaac, I am Jacob, I am Ishmael, I am Moses, I am Jesus son of Mary, I am Mohammad SAAW. . .\" (Roohani Khazain vol 22, p.521)\n\n2.       \"True God is the one who has sent his Messenger in Qadian.\" (Roohani Khazain vol.18 p.231)\n\nVII. Mirza declared that:\n\n1.       \"Except for the Children of Prostitutes, whose hearts have been sealed by God, everyone else has accepted me and believes in my Prophethood.\" (Aina-e-Kamalate Islam, Roohani Khazain vol 5 p.547). . . . .\n\n2.       He, who does not believe on Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani, is Disobedient to God and Prophet and will go to Hell.\" (Advertisement by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad dated 25th May 1900)\n\n3.       I am the \"Self-implanted/Self-cultivated Seedling \" of the British Government. \"Government should take great care regarding this SELF-IMPLANTED SEEDLING . . . . .should instruct its officers to treat ME and MY JAMA'AT with special kindness and favours. Our family has never hesitated in shedding their blood in the way of British Rulers and did not stop from laying down their lives neither do they hesitate now.\" (Roohani Khazain vol.13 p.350)\n\n4.       \"From my early age till now when I am 65 years of age, I have been engaged , with my pen and tongue, in an important task to turn the hearts of Muslims towards the true love & Goodwill & sympathy for the British Government and to obliterate the idea of Jehad from the hearts of stupid (Muslims). \" (Kitab-ul-Bariyah, Roohani Khazain vol 13 p.350)\n\n5.       \" . . . . for the sake of British Government, I have published & distributed 50,000 leaflets in this country (India) other Islamic countries(against jehad). . . . the result is that hundreds of thousands of people have given up their filthy ideas about Jihad.\" (Roohani Khazain vol 15 p.114)[i]\n\nWith regards to the character of Mirza Ghulam Ahmed, it should be noted that such information is not easily available in English. However, countless refuting books have been published in urdu citing the actual quotations from Mirza’s books showing his deviant characteristic. A few examples are given below :\n\nMirza Ghulam writes that \"Cursing is not the style of a Truthful person. A Mo’min does not curse.\" (Izala-e-Auham p.660) While in Nur-ul-Haq, Mirza himself spends over FIVE pages mentioning only one word, “Curse”. He has written this word a 1000 times. (See Nurul Haq,volume 8 of Roohani Khazain. From pages 158 – 162)\n\nWhile habbits of a nabi differs from one prophet to another, the aspect of mercy and good treatment to those under one’s servitude remained prevalent in the Anbiyaa. Mirza Ghulam, who claimed to be in the same rank as that of Anbiya, should also match up to that level of good character. On the contrary a glimpse of Mirza Saheb’s attitude toward his servant has been recorded in Seeratul Mahdi. It states,\n\n“My lady, that mother of Aziz Muzaffer Ahmad, narrated to me that Hazrat Maseeh Mowood usually used warm water to clean himself in the toilet and did not use cold water. One day he asked some maid to keep the tumbler in the toilet. By mistake she kept the tumbler of hot water. After finishing when Hazrat Maseeh Mowood came out, he asked who had kept this tumbler. When he was informed that a certain maid had kept it, he called her and asked her to stretch her hand and then he poured all the remaining water on her hands, so that she will realize that such hot water cannot be used for cleaning (faeces). He did not say anything else to her.\" (See Seerat-ul-Mahdi, part 3, p.243, narration 847)\n\nWhile Mirza Ghulam continued with his self proclaimation of prophethood, many people refuted him. These even included Hindus, Christians as well as Muslims. In response to one such individual Mirza Ghulam states:\n\n\"Abdul Haq Ghaznavi ... O corrupted Jewish natured! In this Padres faces have been turned black and yours as well. ... O Khabees! How long are you going to live? .... Especially the Head of Dajjals, Abdul Haq ghaznawi and his whole clan, upon them may fall 1 million shoes of the Curses of ALLAH. O Filthy Dajjal! Prejudice has blinded you.\" (Zamima Anjam-e-Atham, Roohani Khazain vol.11 pp.45,46)\n\nFrom these very few citations one can safely deduce that Mirza Ghulam did not share much in characteristic with our Noble Prophet salallahu alayhi wasallam. There are many more such examples of such treachery filled in the books of Mirza Ghulam. If only one were to take courage and do a research for oneself. It is in no way that a Nabi of Allah can have such vile character even if the apparent understanding of his follower may be otherwise.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa\n\n\n\n\n\n[i]http://alhafeez.org/rashid/belief.htm"
