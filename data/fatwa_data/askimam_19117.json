  "question": "I cheated to earn a degree, but my current job is unrelated to it. Is my earning halāl?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am working as a senior software developer with qualifications in a pursuing MCA, BSc (English, zoology, botany, chemistry), one-year diploma in computers (Govt. Regd.), as well as another one-year diploma in computers (Aptech Limited). \n\nWhile doing a BSc in a war-torn place, due to the environment there, the government itself allowed complete cheating in exams and everything was out of control.  So, obviously, I passed the first two-years like that, otherwise I would have studied. \n\nMy current job does not depend on the BSc at all.  Is my earning halāl?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nEven though the government may have intentionally overlooked cheating, it was, nonetheless, an impermissible and immoral act.  You should repent and seek Allāh’s forgiveness for your past actions.  However, your cheating on the BSc exams does not affect the permissibility of your current income. \n\n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMuftī Abrar Mirza\nChicago, IL (USA)\n\nUnder the Supervision of Muftī Ebrahim Desai (South Africa)\n\n \n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER – AskImam.org questions\n\nAskImam.org answers issues pertaining to Sharī’ah.
