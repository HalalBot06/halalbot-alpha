  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf a person's wife/sister/mother doesn't observe purdah, what is the shariah ruling about them, especially if someones' wife doesnt follow the purdh rulings of ISLAM?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nOne should try to educate the wife in obseving purdah, explain the benefits and let her talk to other Muslimah who wear purdah, and how they feel about it. Make dua for her and help her out in trying a purdah on at times. Continuously encourage her, but do not be vigorous as this will only make matters worse.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
