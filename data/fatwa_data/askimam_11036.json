  "answer": "QUESTION\nare we allowed to read the qiraat of salaah without moving the lips - especially if our tajweed is weak?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Qiraat of Salaat without moving the lips or tongue will not be correct and the Salaat will not be valid. (Fataawa Mahmoodiya vol.15 pg.93)\n\nTo read the Qiraat in Salaat by moving the lips is compulsory without which Salaat will be invalid. (Shaami vol.1 pg.534; HM Saeed) If your Tajweed is weak, you should endervour to correct your Tajweed by going to a reputable reader and learning correct pronunciation of the words. In the mean time, this is not an excuse for you to recite the Qiraat without moving the lips. The Qiraat should be recited in such a way that a person can hear his own recitation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
