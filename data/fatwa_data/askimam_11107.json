  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)After the second Rakkah of salah, do you have to recite a sura after sura fathiha? 2) is there a dua you can recite whilst waiting for your exam results, so that your get good results?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If a person is performing four Rakaats Fardh Salaat, for example, Dhuhr, Asr and Esha, then he is either following the Imaam or performing Salaat individually. If he is performing Salaat behind the Imaam, then in principle, he can not make any Qiraat in any Rakaat. If he is performing Salaat individually, then he has to make Qiraat by reciting Surah Faatiha and a Surah (minimum three verses or 18 alphabets) in the first two Rakaats. It is Afzal and virtuous to recite only Surah Faatiha in the second two Rakaats. If a person is performing Sunnat Salaat or Nafl Salaat, then he has to recite Surah Faatiha and a Surah in the third and fourth Rakaats as well.\n\n2. Recite ?Hasbiyallaahu wa ni?mal wakeel? while waiting for your results.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
