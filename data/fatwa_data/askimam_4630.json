  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, a person inneed of anything, including a marriage partner, he\nshould turn his gaze to Allah Ta'ala and make Du'aa to Him to fulfil his\nneed. If the etiquettes of making Du'aa are fulfilled, it is hoped that his\nDu'aa will be fulfilled. The ettiquettes of making Du'aa are:\na) Be in the state of Tahaarah (Wudhu)\nb) Praise and glorify Allah\nc) Have faith that Allah Ta'ala is All-Hearing and your Du'aas will be\naccepted.\nd) Recite Durood upon Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) before and\nafter making Du'aa\n\nYou should engage in Du'aa to Allah Ta'ala as much as possible until your\nneed is fulfilled. Apart from the above, our pious predecessors have advised\nto recite 500 times daily Durood upon Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam). This practice has been proven to be effective in getting a\ncompatible marriage partner.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
