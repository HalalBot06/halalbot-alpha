  "question": "Doubts on passing wind whilst praying Salaah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIam a muslim male. I offer every prayer (5 times a day) in the masjid alhamdulillah. My problem is that I pass wind  almost whenever I make wudu and leave for the masjid. So everytime I renew the wudu after reaching the masjid. I feel that I lose the reward of going to masjid with wudu(one good deed and one bad deed forgiven with each step). And worst of all I miss the fazeelat of the first row of the masjid. Because even if I reach 10 minutes before Jamaa't. I invariably break my wudu just before salaah starts and I have to rush back to make wudu and join salaah later. This is not must, but happens more than 50% of the time and even the rest of the time, I am so worried that after coming to the masjid, I sit in the back rows so that if i have to leave I can do so without disturbing many people.\n\nMy question is if I make one wudu after coming to masjid, is it enuf for me to offer one full salaat with imam.(so that I can offer in first row).\n\nAnother would be, if during salaat i break my wudu, do i compulsarily have to leave the prayer to make wudu. It would be very difficult for me to do that everytime because I fear i would be the laughing stock of my friends who are with me. This problem is psychological I guess as when iam out or playing I dont break wind as frequently.\n\nI read similar questions on the forum where mufti sahab has said \" it may be your doubt that u passed wind\", for me its not a doubt, i dont hear or smell but Iam sure I broke it. Please guide me and help me offer salaat with a piece of mind. Medical help didn't yield me results so Iam asking u if i come in the category of a mazur.\n\nAlso, wat do i do when iam reciting quran and break wind? leave and come back.?? again in public its embarassing for a person like me. but i will bear that if shariah doesnt give me any option.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAccording to the information provided by you, you do not fall in the category of a ma’zoor (excused) person.\n\nIf you made wuzu when you arrived at the musjid and you are certain that your wuzu broke, you will have to repeat your wuzu to perform salah. The same ruling is for reciting the Quran. Almighty Allah knows your intention and zeal to walk to the musjid with wuzu and perform salah in the first row. Inshallah, you will be rewarded for that, in spite of you performing salah in the last row.\n\nYou should consider performing wuzu just before salah commences so that your wuzu will last longer and till the end of salah. If you wuzu breaks while performing salah, you should not feel embarrassed before your friends and colleagues.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
