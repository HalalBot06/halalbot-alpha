  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf a male desires a specific female and has continuously dreams about her, at least twice a week on regular basis, is there a meaning to this or is it just a coincidence?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person desires to marry a specific female, he should follow the guidelines set out in Shari?ah, for example, Mashura (consult) or make Istikhaara.\n\nIf the dream about her is due to following the Sunnat Istikhaara, then it is significant. If it is not through Istikhaara, then it is a reflection of his mind and the Shaytaan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
