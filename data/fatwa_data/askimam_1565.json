  "question": "I am 24 Years Old. My mother tells me not to go to the Thursday nights mosque gathering of tablighis and also not to go for 3 days a month etc. Am I required to follow?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy mother has had very bad experiences with my father who treated her very badly. He was involved in the work of tabligh supposedly but in reality he was just showing two different faces. My mother just has developed a dislike or fear of tablighi jamaat because of that. I know her fears are just because of bad experiences. The tablighi jamaat are a group of muslims following the Haq. Should I disobey my mother? I provide for her everything. Whatever she wants I always get for her. Except I want to improve my eeman and islam, therefore I joined the tablighi jamaat. Please help\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is unfortunate that your father ill-treated your mother and that has\nresulted in her resentment for the work of dawah and tabligh. We advise you\nrepair the damage caused by your father by participating in the work of\ndawah and tabligh and show more love and compassion to your mother. You\nshould inform her that should she require your services urgently, that is\nfardh and you prefer being of service to her than going out in dawah and\ntabligh.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti E Desai\nFatwa Dept."
