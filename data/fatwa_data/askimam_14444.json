  "question": "how can it possibly not be kufr? Does the answer given not require more clarification?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI came across the following question and answer and did not understand as to how such blasphemous statements do not tantamount to kufr if said verbally. Furthermore, if one dwells on these thoughts in one's mind until one is led to believing in such statements, how can it possibly not be kufr? Does the answer given not require more clarification?\n\nFurthermore, in another recent question regarding the touching of the sex organ when two men embrace, the answer was that the intention was only embracing and hugging. Although the intention may not be corrupted in the above instance, but is it not necessary to refrain from embracing in such a way, in case it leads towards sexual arousal?\n\nMy purpose in pointing out these issues is not merely to criticise or to find faults in the answers. Alhamdulillah, I have benefited greatly from this site. Rather, the point I am trying to make is that I have found certain answers to brief or ambiguous and it is very easy for the reader to misunderstand the point or to derive a wrong meaning from the answer. It would be more appropriate to make some of the answers more explicit.\n\nJazakallah\n\nWassalaam.\n\nThe above-mentioned question and answer is below:\n\nDoes saying the following in my heart or verbally make me a kaafir: I’m not certain if I said the following intentionally or if it was the devil putting these thoughts into my mind.\n\n \n\n6. \"Allah don’t care about you.\"\n\n \n\n7. \"Allah hates you.\"\n\n \n\n8. \"What does He (Allah) care?\"\n\n \n\n9. \"He (Allah) don’t want you\"\n\n \n\n10. \"If I’m not going to be helped, then why bring me into this world?\"\n\n \n\n11. \"Allah doesn’t know what is best for me?\"\n\n \n\n12. \"Allah hasn’t done what is best for me.\"\n\n \n\n13. \"Allah is oppressing me.\"\n\n \n\n14. \"Why is Allah oppressing me?\"\n\n \n\n15. \"Allah hasn’t got time for me.\"\n\n \n\n16. \"Allah doesn’t want to listen to you.\"\n\n \n\n17. \"Allah is so unmerciful\"\n\n18. \"Why is Allah so cruel?\"\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnswer\n\n1. You clearly state that you said the word ‘stupid’ when your efforts went to waste. The word ‘stupid’ was an expression of disappointment for your efforts being wasted. There is nothing about Kufr or Shirk in stating the word ‘stupid’.\n\n2. All the other statements you enquire about do not constitute Kufr or Shirk.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nJazaakumullah for your kind words and advice:\n\n1. The general principle in Fataawa regarding Kufr is to exercise precaution. If it is possible to interprete a statement which could have meanings of Kufr and give it an Islamic meaning, the that should be done.\n\n2. One should avoid embracing in a way that will lead to sexual arousal.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
