  "question": "1. Please interpret the following dream for me. Jazakallah 2. Please advise till what time can one read Magrib.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. It is a recurring dream in which I am being attacked by cats. I am a female and in reality I am not scared of cats nor have I ever been attacked by them. I enjoy playing with them. I am aware that this normally signifies something bad. Please interpret for me. 2. I have been advised by some people that one can read Magrib until it becomes completely dark and by others that one can only read till 15 minutes after Magrib azaan. Please advise the correct option from above as I do not understand the concepts of twilight etc.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The dream is an indication of your sins being forgiven and your status\nbeing elevated in the sight of Allah by becoming ill.\n2. Maghrib Salaat may be performed until the white twilight remains. That is\nbefore getting completely dark. We suggest you follow the perpetual Salaat\ntimetable which has the commencing and terminating computed Salaat times.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
