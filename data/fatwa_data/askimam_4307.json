  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is the rulleing on wearing topee? What 4 Imams say about this matter? I have noticed lot of brothers do not wear hat (topee) while praying specially Arabs. Did Rasool SA and Sahabaa RA used to wear topee during salat (paryers)? Any Hadiths regarding this matter? Did Rasool SA and Sahabaa RA used to cover their had all the time? JazakAllah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAbu Kabsha (Radhiallaahu Ánhu) narrates that the hats of the companions of\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to be round and spacious.\n(Mirqaat vol.8 pg.246)\n\nIt is narrated by Tabrani on the authority of Ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Ánhuma)\nthat Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to wear a white hat.\n(Ibid)\n\nHassan Basri (Rahmatullah Alayhi) states that the people (Sahaaba -\nRadhiallaahu Anhum) used to make Sajda (prostrate) upon their turbans and\nhats. (Bukhari vol.1 pg.56; Rashidiyya)\n\nMullah Ali Qari (Rahmatulah Alayhi) states that the wearing of the hat has\nbecome one of the salient symbols of Islam. (Mirqaat vol.8 pg.246) It is the\nonly outward and unique salient feature that distinguishes a Muslim from a\nnon-Muslim.
