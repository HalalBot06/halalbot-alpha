  "question": "Is it permissible to undergo the Ultrasound test and know the gender of the child?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs part of the routine tests for a pregnant woman, gynaecologists suggest Ultrasound in order to monitor the health of the baby. The test also reveals the gender of the baby. Is it permissible to undergo the Ultrasound test and know the gender of the child?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to our understanding, a sensor is placed on the abdomen of a female and the picture of the womb is reflected on the screen.\n\nIf so, it is prohibited for a female to unnecessarily reveal her entire or part of her body to a male physician / gynaecologist. If the scan was conducted by a female, then it is not prohibited. As regards knowing the gender of the child through the scan, experience has revealed that the information is not always correct. That can be very disturbing to parents.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
