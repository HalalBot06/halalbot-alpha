  "answer": "QUESTION\nis salwar kameez is sunnat then why dont the people in the gulf region and the rest of the muslim world besides the indian subcontinest dontwear itÂ  every country has their own modest dress then why are we putting culture in to relgion and innovatiing a sunnat which is a major sin why do u wee look down upon a person who wear western clothing that is modest if person wearing salwar kameez better than a person wearing a suit and tie if salwar kameez is an islamic dress then why\nis the prime minister of indian who is a kaffir not ever from the people of the book wearing it\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe Shalwar Kameez is not a Sunnah dress. It does have some features of a Sunnah dress, for example, it is loose and long. That covers the body and also conceals the shape of the body. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] advised us not to imitate others. It is for this reason, the western clothing, suit and tie is undesirable.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
