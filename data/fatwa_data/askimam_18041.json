Hence, it is not permissible to take an insurance policy whether it is medical, life or motor insurance.\n\nHowever, if a person is working for a company and every month an amount is deducted from his salary without his consent, it will be permissible for him to make use of the benefits and it will be considered as a gift to him from the company.\n(Nawaadirul Fiqh, vol.1 pg326, Karachi)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
