  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am having Rs. 1milion with me in bank in india how much zakat I need to pay I purchase a flat on installment is there zakat on it and I have money to pay flat cost in full Jazak Allaho Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen you have an amount equivalent to the nisab of Zakat which is above your basic necessities and a year has passed over that money then you have to discharge Zakat at 140 of the amount. There is no Zakat due on your flat until you fully pay for it.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
