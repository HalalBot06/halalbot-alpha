  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nas women we are told to wear long pants(ijaar/salwar) below our ankles, now if our trouser touch the ground all day (but not in the toilet), then would it be considered napaak?\n\ni asked some aalimas who said it isn't counted as napaak unless u have stepped on najasat and u can see it but some of my family members refuse to accept. please clarify as i am also woried about showin satr if i wear my pants just barely below ankle.jk\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAccording to Shariah, the feet is not part of Satr for a woman (Fataawa Alamghiri Page 58 Vol.1 Rashidiyyah). Therefore it is not necessary for the Izaar/Shalwar to cover the feet. The pants could be kept below the ankle but also be above the ground. If the pants are kept in the manner the dirt from the ground will not come upon the pants.\n\nThe Aalimas are referring to an incident recorded in the books of Ahadith wherein a woman asked Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم ) when we walk in the streets our outer garments touch the floor is it correct to perform Salaah with these garments? Rasulullah صلى الله عليه وسلم responded in the affirmative if there are no apparent/definite impurities on the garment. The response of Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) was based on the principle of Balwa (public predicament) as it would be difficult for everyone to go home and change the clothes and perform Salaah. Therefore, if the Izaar got dirty due to dragging on the floor and there is no apparent impurities on it, Salaah with such an Izaar will be correct.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
