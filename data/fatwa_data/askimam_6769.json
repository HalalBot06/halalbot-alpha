  "question": "how should i repond to this non muslim who states as follows....Where was the voice of the Mullas after 9/11? There was no sound from it. Yet these men say they speak for God",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\"But one thing we do have (americans) , in spite of all our evil, in spite of all our flaws, we do have a heart as witnessed by the fact we are always ready to help people in need. It is American money which is the backbone of humanitarian help in every major international disaster. What Muslim country displays this type of decency and kindness displayed by the US? None! On another matter, Muslims, in general, are always are in your face about how upright and good they are. But let me tell you this, if a Roman Catholic had attacked Mecca in an airoplane and killed innocent people 9/11 style in the name of God and his religion the outcry from the Roman Catholic church would have been enormous. Christians, from all denominations, would have raised funds for the relief of the survivors. But where has the Muslim voice been since 9/11? We don't know because it has been noticable only by its silence. Can these be good moral upright people who see attrocity and stand by without so much of a word of condemnation? Where was the voice of the Mullas after 9/11? There was no sound from it. Yet these men say they speak for God. What a warped sense of God they must have if they think he condones 9/11!!!!\" how should i respond to him.. kindly advise.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Whoever was responsible for the 9/11 tragedy is guilty of a great injustice ? even if he was a Muslim.\n\n2. The Muslims have not condemned this attack simply because they believe that they are not responsible for this attack.\n\n3. Many Muslims have condemned these attacks but since they don?t control the bulk of the media, their voices of condemnation are either played down or nor reported at all.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
