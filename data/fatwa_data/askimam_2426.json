  "question": "How does one get rid of jealously and envy from the heart?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe following is an extract from Bahisti Zewar, which answers your question.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe harms of jealousy and its cure%0D%0AWhen you see a person living comfortably, eating and drinking well, living%0D%0Awith honour and respect, and upon seeing all this you begin to \"burn\" within%0D%0Ayou, begin to have hatred for him or become happy when he experiences any%0D%0Alapse - then this is known as hasad (jealousy or envy). This is a very evil%0D%0Acharacteristic and is also sinful. Such a person passes his entire life in%0D%0Abitterness. In other words, his worldly life and his D%EEn%EE life are both%0D%0Aabhorrent and unpleasant. Great efforts therefore have to be made in order%0D%0Ato come out from this great calamity.%0D%0AThe first cure for this is that the person should think to himself that \"by%0D%0Amy envying him, I am causing harm to myself and no harm whatsoever is%0D%0Abefalling him. The harm that it is causing me and my loss is that all my%0D%0Agood deeds are being wiped out.\" This has been deduced from a Hadith in%0D%0Awhich it is mentioned that hasad devours good deeds just as fire devours dry%0D%0Awood. The reason for this is that this person is indirectly forwarding an%0D%0Aobjection to Allah by saying (indirectly): \"so-and-so person does not%0D%0Adeserve those bounties. Why did You give him these bounties?\" If someone%0D%0Araises an objection to Allah in such a manner, how serious a sin it will be?%0D%0AIt is obvious that such a person will always live with malice and sorrow in%0D%0Ahis heart. As for the person who has been envied, he has suffered no loss%0D%0Awhatsoever. By your envying him, the bounty which he possesses will not%0D%0Adisappear. Instead, the person whom you have envied will benefit in the%0D%0Asense that all your good deeds will go to him.%0D%0A%0D%0AOnce you have thought over all these factors in your mind, praise this%0D%0Aperson (whom you are jealous of) and say good things about him to others.%0D%0AYou should also add by saying: \"All thanks are due to Allah in that he has%0D%0Aall these bounties. May Allah give him all these bounties two-fold.\" If you%0D%0Ahappen to meet this person, meet him with respect and humble yourself. In%0D%0Athe beginning, your soul will be greatly burdened in doing this. However,%0D%0Ahasad will gradually disappear from your heart.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
