  "answer": "QUESTION\nI reached the airport and then to my realatives? house when there was some minutes left for fajr azaan. That is roza hadn?t started yet. But my relatives told me not to keep the roza because you just arrived, etc,etc, so I didn?t. But at that time I thought I could have kept the roza. I don?t know if I actually I would have been able to or not. So I?m worried if I have to keep 60 rozas(kuffara) for that. Although, I did keep one qaza for that day. Please tell me what should be done? 2. in your answers I have read that one should read 100 times subhanallah, 100 times alhamdolillah, 100 times allahu akbar, 100 times astaghfirullah and 100 times lailahaillalah. So I read these each 20 times after every namaaz. Which in total for the day add up to a 100 each. Is this okay. Also, is reading these kalmias, sunnat or just mustahib.or is it that ulimas have prescribed them? I want to know this because I want to tell other people about it and if they ask I would know what it is. Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. You did not break a fast but simply did not fast. There is no Kaffaarah for that. One Qadhaa for the unkept fast was sufficient.\n\n2. All the Dhikrs mentioned in the email are proven in the Ahaadith. The number of times for making those Dhikrs are prescribed by the Ulama. However, in the Hadith it is mentioned to recite 33 times Subhaanallah, 33 times Alhamdulillah and 34 times Allaahu Akbar after every Fardh Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
