  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease answer my question I have submitted this a few times over the last few months and it is never answered!!!\n\nAssalamoalaykum, 1) if a student had to take out an interest bearing loan (haram) to fund their university studies, will the end qualification also be haram, and will any job they subsequently get due to this degree also provide haraam earnings? I am REALLY concerned abvout this and have asked so many times but the question never gets answered so I haven't been able to do anything about it! I would really appreciate if you could answer this for me. I know that the most likely answer will be not to take the loan out in the first place, but please could you just tell me what would happen in the instance above where such money IS used.\n\n2) In relation to this concern about haraam/halaal earnings, if a teacher is teaching the subject 'literature' at secondary school and a portion of the course contains literature or content that is not suitable in Islam, will this mean the teacher's earnings are haraam?\n\nPlease could you answer these questions for me!!!!\n\nRamadan Kareem.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:"
