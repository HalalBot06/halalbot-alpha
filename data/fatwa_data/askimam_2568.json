  "question": "Wudu broke during salaat in Jamaat ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf wudu is broken while praying Salaat with jamaat, should one immediately discontinue his Salaat and leave the Jamaat and pray again with a fresh wudu or should he complete his Salaat with Jamaat and then leave the Jamaat and pray again with a fresh wudu? Will the individual be eligible for 25-27 times reward, or will he lose it because his wudu broke during salaat ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nA person who experiences any hadath (impurity) in Salaat immediately go to\nmake Wudhu. However, if there are many Saffs and it is difficult to break\nthe Saffs to perform Wudhu, he may wait until he gets the opportunity to go\nout.\n\nAfter he has renewed his Wudhu, he could continue his Salaat from where his\nWudhu had broken or repeat the entire Salaat. However, it is better to\nrepeat the entire Salaat. (Bahishti Zewar). It is hoped that he will be\neligible for the full reward of Jamaat in the above instances because there\nwas no default from his line of action as far as his capabilities were\nconcerned.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
