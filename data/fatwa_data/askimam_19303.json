  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a query regarding the internal scaning for pregnent women, does internal scanning werein they insert the probe with medications deep into the vegina make the women napaak, or does she require to do gusul or only Ablution will suffice?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\n \n\nInternal scanning does not make a woman impure. She does not have to make ghusl.In all probability; the inserted medical instrument will have impurities when removed from the internal of a woman. As such, her wudhu will be invalidated.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
