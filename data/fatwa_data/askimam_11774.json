  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe are three brothers and four sisters. All alive and are married. My father had a house built on one kanal land and had four aker of agricultural land. He was also a share holder of a company. Company floated additional shares twice during his life period. Both the elder brothers got one share each. My father?s own share got it registered in my name in place of next of kin in the company register during his life so that it should automatically transferred in my name after his death. He also told to give two lacs each to my four sisters as a cost of this share Later my father confirmed this in presence of the two brothers. My father during his last leg of life, gave power of attorney of the agricultural land to my eldest brother without making a mention to me or to my sisters. After the death of my father the share transferred in my name automatically. Now during the phase of distribution of his assets.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf your father was survived by three sons and four daughters, then his\nestate will be divided into 10 equal shares and distributed as follows: Each\nson will inherit two shares and each daughter will inherit one share.\n\nSome aspects of of the details of the question are not clear. In principle,\nif your father gave any of his possession to any child during his lifetime\nas an outright gift, then that will belong to that child and the gifted item\nwill not form part of his estate. If the agriculture land was not given to\nyou in his lifetime and only transferred to you after his death, then that\nwill form part of the net Estate. All the heirs will be entitled to their\nShar'ee shares in that land.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
