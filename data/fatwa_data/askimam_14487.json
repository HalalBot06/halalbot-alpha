  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nis it allowed to have a girlfreind\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah states in the Qur’aan, ‘Do not come close to adultery.’ Therefore, adultery and any act prior to adultery like speaking, seeing, etc. is Haraam and forbidden. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] is reported to have said, ‘The Zina of the eyes is to look, the Zina of the tongue is to speak…’ (Jaamius sagheer Hadith4564)\n\nIn the Qur’aan, Allah praises those believers who protect their private parts from indulging in any Haraam. Imaam al-Ghazaali [ra] has mentioned that a person will not be able to protect himself from committing adultery unless he protects his eyes from looking (at strange women), his heart from thinking (about strange women) and his limbs of the body from any Haraam act like touching, speaking, listening, etc. (Fathul Qadeer vol.4 pg.86; Ilmiyah)\n\nIf a person has a boyfriend/girlfriend then in some way or the other, he will be involving himself/herself in some form of Zina which is Haraam. Therefore, it is not permissible to have illicit Haraam relationship with the opposite gender. Allah has created man with needs and necessities, and has also shown man the way to fulfil these needs. A man needs to fulfil his carnal desires and needs a partner in life. To fulfil this need of man, Allah has made Nikah (marriage). Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] while addressing a gather of youth said, ‘Whoever has the strength and ability to get married should do so, otherwise he should fast. Because it causes one to lower his gazes and …’\n\nAllah has made Nikah a Sunnah of the Prophet [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and therefore one should act upon this great Sunnah as it will save a person from many Haraam acts, protect one’s chastity and save the lineage of the coming generation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
