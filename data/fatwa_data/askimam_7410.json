  "question": "take bayat to a sheikh and when he dies, don't take bayat to another, but the Majlis group take bayat to a sheikh and when he dies they take bayat to another,who is correct or are both incorrect",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI notice the sunnis take bayett to a sheikh and when he dies they don't take bayett to another as they say he is more powerful when he passes away,but the Majlees group take bayett to a sheikh and when he dies they take bayett to another,who is correct or are both incorrect\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBay?at (allegiance) itself is not purposeful. The actual purpose is to reform oneself through the process of Bay?at. If the actual purpose is fulfilled without following the process of taking Bay?at, then that is sufficient.\n\nIn view of the actual purpose of Bay?at being reformation, any one of the procedures, not renewing Bay?at after the death of one?s Shaykh or renewing the Bay?at may be correct if the actual purpose of Bay?at is achieved.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
