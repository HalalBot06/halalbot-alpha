  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am trying to learn the Holy Quran with meanings and fortunately I found a dictionary  in Hindi. Alhamdulillah I am memorizing meanings from this dictionary and referring other translation to understand meanings of the holy verses. However I believe that if I am practicing by writing words on paper, I can memorize meanings very soon. Please advise if I can write words on rough papers without writing any verse of the Quran. If yes then how can I discard these papers later.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt will be permissible to study the meanings of the words and write them down for better retention. The preferable method of discarding the papers would be to bury them or place them in a body of water such as a river or stream. Having respect for items that assist one in acquiring knowledge is a means of attaining blessings and radiance in one’s knowledge.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Yusuf bin Yaqub,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nConcurred by:\n\nMl. Ehzaz Ajmeri,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nDarul Iftaa"
