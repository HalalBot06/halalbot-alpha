  "question": "Is Allah every where?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSaadu-deen Taftazani has explained the aspect of 'Where is Allah' in the\nfollowing words, 'And he is not at any place'. (Sharh Aqaaid)\n\nImaam Maalik was asked about the Aayat in Surah Taaha, 'Allah is above His\nÁrsh', he answered 'Being above (Istawaa) is known but the reality is\nunknown and - questioning that - is innovation.' Jaaluddin Suyyuti also\ncomments on the Aayat saying, 'Istawaa (being above) according to whatever\nis appropriate for Allah. (Jalaalayn vol. 2 p. 260).\n\nHowever, the verse does not speak about the Zaat of Allah Taãla being on the\nÁrsh but it is to indicate the establishment and control of the Kingdom of\nAllah by Himself.\n\nAnd Allah Taãla Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
