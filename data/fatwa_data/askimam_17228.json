  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI got 1 durood sharif from a bayaan on a web-site,according to that bayaan if any muslim{ should have love for allah and his prophet(p.b.u.h.)} keep reading that durood sharif he will soon see our prophet (p.b.u.h.) in his dream (insha allah).\n\nI can not listen that durood sharif properly but whatever i could listen i'm trying to write down here.please check it and correct it if there is any mistake.\n\ndurood sharif is here\n\nALLAHUMMA SALLI ALAA RUHI MUHAMMADIN FIL ARWAAH,\n\nALLAHUMMA SALLI ALAA JASHADI MUHAMMADIN FIL AJSHAAD,\n\nALLAHUMMA SALLI ALAA QUBURI MUHAMMADIN FIL QUBUR.\n\nPLEASE REMIND US IN UR DUAA\n\nWASSALAAM.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nTo make the ziyarah of Rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wasallam) in ones dream is indeed a great honour. However, It is not the purpose (maqsood) of Shariah. Rather, the purpose of Shariah is to follow the Sunnah of Rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wasallam). To recite Durood and Salawaat upon Rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wasallam) is encouraged and has great virtues. The Durood and Salawat shown by Rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wasallam) should be read.\n\nHazrath Shaikh Zakariyya (RA) has compiled a book on 40 Durood from various Ahadith. Obtain that and recite it daily. Focus on what Shariah demands of you, the Sunnah of Rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wasallam) and reciting Durood and Salawat upon Rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wasallam). If you have the good fortune to make the ziyarah of Rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wasallam) in your dream, that will be a bonus. You may also recite the Durood as mentioned in your email.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
