There is one incedent happend last month (Allah Forgive me for that), i committed a sin of having a physical relationship with another woman. Now i am feeling very very guilty, frustrated and also affraid of getting Azab of Allah in any form of disease and also at the day of judgement. I have started my prayers and asking God to forgive me for that act. I swear to God and his beloved prophet Mohammad Rasool Allah that i wont do anything like that again Inshallah-o-Talah. Please help me by letting me know what i should do to make the kufara. right now i have told my wife about that but not the whole truth because she is pregnent and it wont be a good effect on her, also but she forgives me whatever half truth i told her. i cant tell it to my parents because they are not here with me and they will be upset and i love them a lot, i can't let them down like that. I cant do any irrational step that ruin life of my beloved wife and my loving parents. Please instruct me what i should do that God forgive me, I know it is really the biggest sin but please tell me the KUFARA of that sin. God Bless Every Muslium in the world.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for presenting your problem to the institute. You write that you committed adultery recently and you are filled with remorse.%0D%0A%0D%0AFirstly, I suggest that you should not tell ANYBODY about your misdemeanor. This is between you and Allah Ta'ala and you have to make SINCERE tawbah, show remorse and promise never to fall into this trap again. This also means you will have to adopt a life-style where you will not find yourself in a situation of temptation again. Allah Ta'ala's commandments are clear, \"Do not go near adultery? Shaitaan is ever ready to destroy your imaan so don't ever think you are safe from his plans. You have to change your lifestyle completely and move closer to your Creator.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe have been commanded to abstain from intermingling with the opposite sex and given clear commandments as to how we should conduct ourselves with non mahram men and women. Bring Islam into your life and home so that your children too will grow up with the Sunnahs as their culture and Quranic values as their guiding light. This will help you to change your lifestyle too and insha'allah the Rahma of Allah Ta'ala will descend on your home and life.%0D%0A%0D%0ADo make lots of istighfar, dua and nafl salaah. It is also advisable to give sadaqah abundantly as it serves as an atonement for sins too. May Allah Ta'ala protect all Muslims from major and minor sins.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A1SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
