  "question": "Suppose a husband (ofcourse muslim) divorced his wife and after some time (say after few years) he wants to re-marryher. She is also in the same opinion",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Mufti Saheb, Asslaamu alaikum(var..), I have few queries for you, 1. Suppose a husband (ofcourse muslim) divorced his wife and after some time (say after few years) he wants to re-marry her. She is also in the same opinion. But Islam says that the wife can marry only after marrying another man(muslim), had intercouse with him and divorced by him. There should be some good reason behind this since this law is defined by Allah, the Almighty. But it seems to be (for me) some complicated method (intercouse with another man and divorce). So, kindly explain me the benefit of this law in re-marrying divorced wife. 2. Family planning is prohibitted in Islam. Is it correct? Can we use condoms or other methods? 3. Can we use perfumes (alcaholic) for our dress? One mufti here in Malaysia said that it is allowed as long as we don't drink alcahol. Is it true? 4. Can a muslim male wear red or yellow colour cloths? May the Almighty give you and your team good health and long life as you all are doing a noble job. Allah Haffiz, Khalil Ahamed Munavary.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If a husband issued his wife one or two divorces and wishes to reconcile%0D%0Awith her, he may do so. If the divorces were Raj'ee (revocable) divorces, he%0D%0Amay reconcile with her during the Iddat (waiting period) after divorce. The%0D%0AIddat is three menses if the woman experience menses or three months if she%0D%0Adoes not experience menses. If she is conceived, the Iddat will be till%0D%0Abirth. If the Iddat terminated or the husband issued a Talaaq-e-Baain%0D%0A(irrevocable divorce), then he may reconcile with his ex-wife only by%0D%0Areperforming Nikah with her. a Raj'ee divorce is that which the husband has%0D%0Aissued in clear terms. A Baain divorce is that which the husband issued in%0D%0Aambiguous terms with the intention of divorce. If the husband issued his%0D%0Awife three divorces, then only he cannot reconcile with his wife until%0D%0AHalaalah is done. Halaalah is a process wherein the wife marries another man%0D%0Aand consummates with her and he voluntarily divorces her. After spending%0D%0AIddat, the ex-husband may propose to her. If she accepts, then only they may%0D%0Aremarry.%0D%0A2. Q: Are contraceptions permissible? A: All forms of reversible%0D%0Acontraception (e.g. condoms, IUD, etc.) are permissible on condition that it%0D%0Ais not used out of fear of poverty and also that it is consentual between%0D%0Ahusband and wife. Hadhrat Abu Sa%E9ed Khudhry (RA) reports that one person%0D%0Aasked Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) about Azal (Coitus%0D%0AInterruptus). Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) replied, 'When Allah%0D%0ATa%E3la intends creating a child, nothing can stop him.' (Mishk%E3t pg. 275;%0D%0AQadeemi)%0D%0A3. Q: Is it permissible to use a perfume, deodorant, etc. which contains%0D%0Aalcohol, and if so, can one perform Salaat without washing it off?%0D%0AA: It is not permissible to use deodorants that contain alcohol from grapes%0D%0Aor date extracts. Such perfumes are impure and Salaat with it is invalid.%0D%0AHowever, if the alcohol is synthetic, it is pure and permissible to use.%0D%0ASalaat without washing off such perfumes will be valid. Sometimes, it%0D%0Abecomes difficult to differentiate between genuine and synthetic alcohol.%0D%0AThus, to be on the safe side, one should rather prefer using deodorants and%0D%0Aperfumes that are labelled as 'alcohol-free', especially when such perfumes%0D%0Aare easily available. (Mufti M Saeed Motara; Azaadville)%0D%0A4. It is permissible but undesirable for men to wear red and yellow%0D%0Agarments.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
