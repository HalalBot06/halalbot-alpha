  "question": "1. Should the bathroom door be closed if one is doing namaaz in the same room or it doesnâ€™t matter? 2. Is it mentioned in Quran that Palestine belongs to Muslims?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n2. Is it mentioned in Quran that Palestine belongs to Muslims? If not this then, is anything similar to or related to Palestine and Jews mentioned in the Quran? This is because my teacher (non-muslim) was talking about the current Palestine and Israeli conflict and its history. She said that according to Jew?s Book their god told them that it?s their land and (without any knowledge) said Muslim?s God (Allah) told them that it?s Muslim?s land. So I later corrected her that it doesn?t say anything like that in Quran. Later I started thinking if what I said was correct or not. Please clarify. Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is not necessary for the bathroom door to be closed before performing Salat. However, if the door is open and that affects the concentration in Salat, then the door should be closed.\n\n2. The world knows that Palestine is the land of Muslims and has been unjustly occupied by the Jews.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
