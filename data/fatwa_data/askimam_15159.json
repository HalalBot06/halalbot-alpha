  "question": "Does Quran speaks about corrupt men and women in general or does it refer to men and women who commit adultery?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nQuran says in surah Al-Nour \"corrupt women are for corrupt men, and corrupt men, for corrupt women - just as good women are for good men, and good men, for good women\"\n\nNow my question is does Quran speaks about corrupt men and women in general or does it refer to men and women who commit adultry.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThis verse was revealed in regards to the false accusation made on Hazrat A’isha (radiallahu anha). The commentators of the Quran say that this verse also shows the general pattern of life is such that corrupt men and women or good men and women normally end up getting married to each other. This is not a fixed rule though. Sometimes the contrary may occur where a good man or woman may marry a bad man or woman. However as far as the Prophets of Allah, Allah gave them such spouses that were from those people who were not bad and evil. An example of this is Hazrat A’isha (radiallahu anha) Allah had revealed these verses to free her from the accusations that were made on her and that she was the most suitable as a wife for Rasulullah (sallalahu alayhi wasallam) (Ma’ariful Quran, vol 5, pg 371) \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nYa'qoob Dadabhai,\n\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
