  "question": "In our masjid we dont have an official Imam and the president of the masjid who literally sings while reciting quran",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn our masjid we dont have an official Imam and the president of the masjid who literally sings while  reciting quran and do not recite with tajweed and makes wudu by running wet hands on his socks(cotton).People have tried to stop him from leading prayers but he is the most Insane person I have ever seen ,he thinks he owns  the masjid,anyways My question is, salah behind this imam is valid? If not can you please give me a solution and also to let you know that other masjid is at least 8 miles from my place and not sure if I go there I wud get the jamaat as the masjid is locked out sometimes.\n\nMy other question is- I am looking out for suitable girl for my marriage and going through my parents for that purpose I just want to know is it allowed in sharia to talk to the girl before marriage to see what kind of mentality she has?As I am looking for the girl who want to follow shria in home and apply when she start a family with me.can you also please let me know the sharia rulings and limits for me to talk or see a  suitable girl for marriage as she is non mahram to me,if there is any chance for that.If it is prohibitted for me in sharia I would oblige by that and just go with the opinion of my parents and girls parents.\n\nJazakallah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are 2 aspects to this query: A. Imam/President, B. Validity of Salah\n\nIt is important to first and foremost change the attitude of the President. Him being at this position does not make him autonomous. He is responsible to the community and the board. It is extremely important that a few responsible members of the community go and talk to him in a dignified and mature way. He is also an adult and if he is addressed in the correct and professional manner, he would certainly listen. According to Shariah, it is not permissible to make masah over regular cotton or nylon socks. Shariah has granted permission for masah over khuffayn (leather socks). Therefore if one is certain that the Imam did make masah over regular socks, Salah behind him is not permissible. The responsible members of the community could also address this issue with him. It is better if there is a qualified Alim in the community who could explain to him the Shar'ee ruling of masah over regular socks. Wisdom and tolerance are key elements that need to be adopted when approaching him. If the President changes his attitude, you should perform Salah in this masjid otherwise you should try to attend the other masjid closest to you.\n\nIt is not permissible to have any contact with a non-Mahram female. You may communicate via her Mahram. If you happen to marry her Allah will bless the union and this will invoke His Mercy in your marriage.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
