  "question": "Why is it that people say sufism is wrong and their practices are bid'ah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSufism is a process of spiritual upliftment. It is a way of reforming oneself and attaining closeness to Allah Ta'ala. Spiritual upliftment, reformation and attaining closeness to Allah are orders replete in the Qur'aan.\n\nIf it is possible for any individual to reform himself, he should do so. However, it is generally noticed that individuals experience difficulties in reforming themselves and seek assistance of a spiritual guide who is pious and adhere to Shari'ah in reforming themselves. The practise of taking allegiance (Bay'at) and following the guidance of one's spiritual mentor is called Sufism.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
