  "question": "Is it permissable to have engagements if it is held within the context of the shariah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf by engagement, confirmation to marry is meant, that is in order.\n\nHowever, the general concept of engagement which resembles a mini-marriage has no basis in Islam. Such a custom is against the spirit of simplicity in Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
