  "answer": "QUESTION\nI always send to the institute about my problems in getting married and get great replies I met a foreigner man who recently converted to Islam, I have been introduced to him through some relatives as a marriage proposal. His reasons for converting to Islam were not strong enough, and he says he doesn?t have time to read in Quraan and learn more but he will eventually. Anyways I didn?t feel he is a believer from the heart I felt he is only following the culture as he lives here and works here right now, just my feelings and I feel like I want to marry from my culture but other things about this man seems ok. Am I wrong to refuse this marriage proposal??\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMasha-Allah, you most certainly are thinking wisely. Alhumdulillah, your priority in choosing a life long marital partner must be Deen. A pious partner who will be of an assistant in your Deen, Islaam. He too must be compatible.\n\nFurthermore sensing your discontentment now, consider a life time. If you feel negative don't hang on, terminate contact immeadiatly. If you are undecided, make Istikhaara for a few days, then decide.\n\nMay Allah Ta'ala grant you happiness with a suitable match. Insha-Allah AAmeen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n2SOCIAL DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
