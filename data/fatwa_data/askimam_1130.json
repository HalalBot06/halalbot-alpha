  "question": "Salam, my question is: what will happen to a muslim young lady if u takes off the mendeela? Is it wrong to take off the mendeela, if know that it might happen make someone a better muslim?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am going to be engaged soon, and my futures husband wants be to take of the mendeela. He used to pray but stop for some reason. He tells me if i take off the mendeela he would do anything i want. For some reason or another i believe i can help him start praying and fasting again. But it seems the mendeela is the price of that. He tells me he wants me to help him start praying and fasting again. For some reason i know after some time he will tell me to put the mendeela back on. Everytime he tells me to take it off i say no. But know i am having second thoughts and am thinking that i can make him a better muslim and show him that the mendeela is part of islam and why it is. But i have to take it off first. I guess what i am asking for is advice. I do not know what to do.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe do not know what is meant by ?Mendeela?. If a boy and girl are engaged, they are still Ghayr Mahaarim to one another. They have to observe strict Hijaab until they marry, therefore, it is not permissible for them to communicate with one another before marriage. If by ?Mendeela? you refer to the Hijaab, then it is incorrect to remove it to please your future husband. That being the remedy to his Salaat and fasting is incorrect. What if he still does not perform Salaat and fast? and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
