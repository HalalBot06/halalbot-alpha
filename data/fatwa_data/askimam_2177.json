  "question": "Are we punished in this life or merely tested?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease can you tell me whether everything in this life is according to taqdeer or are we punished for bad deeds and rewarded for good. Or are the bad things that happen merely tests? May Allah reward you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala says, 'Do people think that they will say we have faith and%0D%0Athey will be left alone and not tested.' (29:2)%0D%0A%0D%0A'And Certainly We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of%0D%0Awealth, lives and fruits. But give glad tidings to the As-sabirin (the%0D%0Apatient ones) who: when afflicted with calamities say, Truly: To Allah we%0D%0Abelong and truly to Him we shall return.' (Baqarah)%0D%0A%0D%0A'And whatever misfortunes mefalls you, it is because of what your hands have%0D%0Aearned.' (42:30)%0D%0A%0D%0A'Problems have appeared on land and sea because of what the hands of man%0D%0Ahave earned (bad deeds) that Allah may make them taste a part of that which%0D%0Athey have done, in order that they may return (by repenting to Allah, and%0D%0Abegging his pardon).%0D%0A%0D%0AIn view of the abovementioned verses, it is understood that adverse%0D%0Aconditions that come upon man are a test for some and a punishment for%0D%0Aothers. Patience should be exercised by those having firm faith when faced%0D%0Awith a difficulty. For most definitely, it is test which in turn will be a%0D%0Ameans of attaining reward and proximity to Allah. In an event where a person%0D%0Ahas erred by disobeying Allah, then trials and tribulations are a punishment%0D%0Ain order that he revert to Allah through the medium of Tawbah (repentance).%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
