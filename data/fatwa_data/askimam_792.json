  "question": "Can we read the tafseer(Ma'ariful Quran)by holding it without wudhu ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSince, we can touch the qaida without wudhu for teaching children, and we also can touch and read some quranic ayaats in dua's. Is it necessary to make wudhu to touch the tafseer?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIdeally, one should make Wudhu before touching and reading Ma'riful Qur'aan.\n\nHowever, it is permissible to touch and read Ma'riful Qur'aan without Wudhu.\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
