  "question": "I have a question about tablighi jammat..Is it undisirable to disobey the mashura and how should I tell the tabligh brothers about my plans. Could you please help me",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI live in a place where there are about four muslims. The mashura thinks that I should stay were I live to do the work of dawah but it is very hard to find a halal job or any job for that matter also they want me to go on four months( which is probably a good idea) but I don?t think they understand my situation here. If I was to go on four months inshallah when I return to were I live i will have the same problem as im having now( no job and living very far from other muslims) What I think I should do is save money and study deen abroad then return to an area with more muslims. Is it undisirable to disobey the mashura and how should I tell the tabligh brothers about my plans. Could you please help me\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour enthusiasm to adhere to Mashwara is commendable. However, in order for us to respond kindly explain; a) What jobs are available, b) Do you have any dependants, c) What is your age?\n\nWe await your response.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
