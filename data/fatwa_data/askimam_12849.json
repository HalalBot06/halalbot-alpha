  "answer": "QUESTION\nMay Allah reward you all for you help to the ummah by means of the questions you answer. I have a question in regard to contraception. My wife due to circumstances has started taking the contraceptive injection. This lasts for 3 months at a time. We have just found out it contains human hormones. Is this allowed? You answer to this would be most helpful. Jazakallah for your help.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ: Are contraceptions permissible?\n\nA: All forms of reversible contraception (e.g. condoms, IUD, etc.) are permissible on condition that it is not used out of fear of poverty and also that it is consentual between husband and wife.\n\nHadhrat Abu Saéed Khudhry (RA) reports that one person asked Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) about Azal (Coitus Interruptus). Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) replied, 'When Allah Taãla intends creating a child, nothing can stop him.' (Mishkãt pg. 275; Qadeemi)\n\nIf this injection is prescribed to you by a physician or gynecologist, then it is permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
