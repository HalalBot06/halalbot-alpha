  "question": "Is it permissible to invest in the Oasis Crescent Equity Fund?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe have had a direct meeting with the board of Oasis.\n\nAs yet, we are not satisfied that these funds are Shari'ah compliant. The\nboard members themselves have distinctly displayed that they are still\ngetting their act in order. Until we are not fully satisfied, we cannot\ndeclare investing in such funds to be Halaal.\n\nThe onus now lies with Oasis to dispel our misgivings which we have\nexpressed, and convince us that all their transactions are above board. If\nthis can be achieved, we would gladly declare investing in such funds as\nHalaal.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
