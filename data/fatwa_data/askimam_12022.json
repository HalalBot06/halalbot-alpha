  "question": "Is it Sunnah to always kiss our wives b4 leaving home for the Masjid? :)If so, kindly quote the Hadith.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhile it is narrated that Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] did sometimes kiss his wives and perform Salaat thereafter without repeating the wudhu, it is preferable (mustahabb) to perform one?s Salaat without kissing the wife before it as according to many Ulama, amongst them Imaam Shaafi?ee [ra], the Wudhu breaks by kissing the wife. (Imdaadul fattaah pg.90)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
