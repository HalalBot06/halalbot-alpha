  "answer": "QUESTION\nwhat must one do to always remain successful,honest and always independant,and stress free id there any duah to read.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for approaching the institute with your request. %0D%0A%0D%0AIt is commendable that you desire to be honest, independent and successful. From all the wonderful and distinguished ne'maah Allah Ta'ala has poured upon us, the most precious ne'maah which will bring us total success, joy, and honour in this world and in the hereafter is the gift of imaan. There can be nothing greater one can own than the full yaqeen and belief in \"La ilaaha-illallaa Mohammadur-rasoollaah\". If one's belief and faith is firmly fixed and grounded that Allah Ta'ala is the giver of everything and that in following the precepts of our beloved Nabi (sallallaahu alayhi wassallam) we can achieve all that we desire in this world and the hereafter, then we are on the right track.%0D%0A%0D%0AEquip yourself with the knowledge of the sunnahs as they pertain to every aspect of your life. Live your life according to the examples and teachings of Nabi (sallallaahu alayhi wassallam). By practicing the sunnahs and by obeying the commands of Allah Ta'ala you will find that all your worldly tasks will become stress free and filled with great barakaah, insha'allah. Obstacles which come your way will cause you little concern for your faith in your Creator will strengthen your ability to cope with calamities, insha'allah. Strictly adhere to the 5 daily salaah under all circumstances, recite the Holy Quraan daily with tajweed and understanding, increase zikr, istigfaar and darood shareef and observe the rights of your fellow human beings over you. Exercise sincererity in all your dealings with Allah Ta'ala and your fellow man and be mindful that Allah Ta'ala knows all, sees and hears all.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou may also recite as often as you can some of the beautiful qualities of Allah Ta'ala with the hope that you will be rewarded abundantly through glorifying Him, the one who Created you. (e.g., recite Al-A'zeez, Al-Mutakabbir, Al-Qahhaar, Al-Wahhaab, Al-Fattah, Al-A'leem, etc). I suggest you approach a learned scholar in your area to guide and teach you how to recite these qualities of Allah Ta'ala. You should also consider putting aside some time daily to learn more about deen so that you are equipped to understand and practice more effectively and insha'allah teach your family and friends also. May Allah Ta'ala guide you and grant you success in this world and the hereafter, ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0ASister Fadila%0D%0ASOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
