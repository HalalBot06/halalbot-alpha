  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy son is two and a half years old. These days he is going through potty training and due to which we need to leave him without pants and diaper for some time to make him realize about it. I am living in a company provided furnished accommodation which has wall to wall carpet pasted. Meaning I can not remove the carpets for the sake of his potty training. Some times a few drops of his pee falls on the carpets. We normally wipe that area with a wet cloth three times. I used to be a very strict person regarding Taharaah , now I just don?t know what to do. My question is: Can we bring Pakee by cleaning the carpet three times with wet cloth? If not what we should do.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, purity can be attained by washing the impure area thrice, rinsing out the water upon each washing.\n\nThis can be accomplished on the carpet by washing the area, then either vacuuming it dry or wiping it dry with a clean cloth or by letting it air dry. This process will then be repeated two more times. (Tahtawi)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
