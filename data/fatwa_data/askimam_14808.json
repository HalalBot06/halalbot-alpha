  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWe have been blassed with a baby boy. Kindley comment on the appropriateness of these names.\n\nSubhan\nZohaeb &\nAniq\n\nAlso can you kindley tell us the meaning of these names.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n   Allah Ta’ala make him pious and Allah fearing, a coolness to your eyes and utilize him for the service of His Deen, Ameen.\n   Subhaan – A word used to declare purity and distance from something eg Subhaanallahi Min Shareek ie How pure and distant is Allah from any partner! In this form, the word is not a noun and therefore not suitable as a name. It also appears sometimes as a noun in the meaning of \"self\", but this form of usage is rare.\n   Suhayb – Name of one of the prominent companions of Nabi Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam, who was known as Suhayb Roomi (R.A). Some details about him can be found in Fazaail-e-Amaal (pg 27- Stories of the Sahaba).\n      - Definitely suitable as a Muslim name.\n      - Literally: A person of reddish white skin color (complexion).\n   `Aniq – If this is a derivative of the alphabet hamza then it means trim, neat, elegant etc.\n            – if it is a derivative of `ayn, it means long necked, which in Arabic literature denotes honor and respect, eg Nabi Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam said in a hadeeth: \"Those with the longest necks on the Day of Qiyamah will be the Mu’adhins (those who call out the adhaan).\n\n- Important note: Pronunciation is the criterion in differentiating between either meaning.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best.\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
