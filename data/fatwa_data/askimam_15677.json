  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1 Is it ok to repeat your surahs for tarawee salaah, and if so – what is the maximum surahs you should know in order to validate this.\n2 Can we follow an imaan on tv or radio etc for the tarawee salaah?\n3 As a female are you allowed to use a ‘pill’ to stop the menstruation during Ramadaan time?\n4 Please can you provide me with contact details for Islamic lesson such as Arabic, fiqh, hadith etc.. in Durban and Johannesburg area\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1) It is permissible to recite the same two Surahs in the twenty Rakaats of Taraweeh. If a person recites Suratul Asr and Suratul Ikhlaas in the first and second rakaat of the entire twenty rakaats of Traweeh, the Salaah is valid. It is not necessary to recite a new Surah in every Rakaat. Therefore the minimum number of Surahs for the validity of Taraweeh would be two and for Witr Salaah will be three.\n \n\n2) One of the conditions for following an Imaam is Ittisaal (joining) of the Sufoof (rows). Since this is not found when following on the Radio or television, it is not permisble. One should abstain from watching television as it is Haraam (prohibited).\n\n3) It is permissible.\n\n4) We suggest that you contact the Jamiatul Ulama (Transvaal) in Johannesburg on the following number 011- 373 8000 or the Jamitaul Ulama (Kwa Zulu Natal) in Durban on the following number 031- 306 7786.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai \nDarul Iftaa"
