  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have big family problem. I need to do doa to Allah and need some advice. I have 3 older brother (3 of them r older than me age 35,33,30),I and 1 younger sister(age15 unmarried). My parents are still alive. My father got 2nd marriage 3 yrs ago after 35 yrs of Conjugal life with my mother. Anyway, he gave house to live and 2 shop to my mom and she was living Alhamdulillah good life, getting money from those property and this is the only one source  of income of my mom. Everything was going fine but within 2 yrs she’s facing lots of problem creating by my all brothers, my oldest brother demanded 30,000$ to my mom to mortgage that 2 shop to Bank which is her only source of income!  She did everything to satisfy her son whatever my brother said that time. Now a days, he’s demanding again to get both of that shop! And my mom knew if she does whatever my brother telling her now she’ll facing economical problem because my brother will be separate to get everything and he won’t give any money to mom, by the way he’s married and has 1 child. He pressuring too much to my mom sometimes he got too angry and she feels insecure and couldn’t understand what should be done, he told to my mom that if she doesn’t do he’ll abandon my mom. I’m the only person that understand my mother’s problem and she always asking suggestion to me and my husband, my husband very kind person, he knew everything about my family. I’m living abroad so phone call is the only way to helping my mom at this time. My brother doesn’t like to talk to me and he is angry with my mom cause sharing everything to me. My mom understand he’s very much greedy person and demanding everything one after another without thinking other brothers-sisters right, all above my mom’s right. My second brother got married 1 yr before and separated within 1 hour (believe or not!) without telling anything to my mom. He doesn’t care about my mother’s any problem or any kind of family occasion. My brothers never thought my mom's feeling, what exactly she wants. I and my mom always thought that after separated my father with his new family my brothers could be understand our feelings, they would stand beside my mother.\n\n \n\nAnyway, I feel very much depressing,sad for my mom and sister, i always cry for my mom and sister, my sister is sick for 2/3 yrs and my mom worried about her future cause she’s the only one person to think about her. Sometimes I stop talking to my brothers and they never feel their responsibility for me as a oldest brother. But I always do pray and doa for all of them could you please tell me some doa and advice that Allah-Rabbul-Alamin accept my doa and help me and my mom to relief this problem and mental pressure, I’m suffering this pressure for long time and this time I shouldn’t feel too much pressure for my unborn baby. By the way, i am not very much good in english so that some of my explanation might be hard to understand. I appologize for that.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nDisclaimer : Fiqhi Site - Your question cannot be accepted at this site.
