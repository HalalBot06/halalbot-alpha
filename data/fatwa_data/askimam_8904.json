  "answer": "QUESTION\ni just want to know about the al-huda international working in pakistan. And about the lady dr. farhat hashmi, why every aalim is saying thats he is wrong?. also i want to know about Albani and kelani sahab.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe do not have any information regarding Dr Farhat Hashimi and Kelani Saheb.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs for al-Albaani, our view is that the knowledge of every person?s inner conditions and intentions are best known to Almighty Allah. Hence, we cannot question his intentions and inner aspirations. However, what we wish to comment on is his method of compilation and outward impression.%0D%0A%0D%0AFor this an entire and detailed treatise needs to be compiled. However, the crux of the matter is that many Ulama from around the world have spoken out vigorously against him and the attitude adopted by him in his writings. Whilst there may be many benefits in his works, there are a lot of grave ?mistakes? therein as well. And one may argue that the benefit be taken and the mistakes be excluded. But, this is something that is only possible for the very learned and not for anyone and everyone.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe condition of the Ummah today is that so much of liberalism has crept in that the basic teachings of Islam have also been forgotten. Hence, the majority of the Ummah are ill-equipped for the above theoretical ?solution?. This is one of the many reasons why so many Ulamaa-e-Haqq have discouraged even reading his compilations.%0D%0A%0D%0ANote: This is just a brief explanation, as mentioned above. This topic needs an extensively detailed article whereby every aspect could be entailed. Kindly keep a watch on our website. We are busy preparing a detailed article on this topic. We hope Allah Ta?ala guides us and grant us the ability to complete it in the near future, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
