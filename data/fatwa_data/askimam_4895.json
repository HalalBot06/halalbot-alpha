  "answer": "QUESTION\nassalaam-o-aliakum, if the cow is first stunned, so the cow becomes paralyzed, so its easy to zabiha the cow, is the meat going to be halal or not, fi amanallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Makrooh to stun the animal for the convenience of Zabah. An alternate\nmethod should be adopted for the convenience of Zabah. However, if the\nanimal is slaughtered after being stunned, and is alive, the Zabah will be\ncorrect and the meat will be Halaal.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
