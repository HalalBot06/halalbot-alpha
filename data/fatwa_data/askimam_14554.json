  "question": "Can I pray NAMAAZ in prayer room with Jeans n wearing scarf,",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhen i am in Uni , i have to wear jeans, Can I pray NAMAAZ in prayer room with Jeans n wearing scarf,\n\nIs it ok to clean yourself with tissue after urine, I dont feel satisfied so when i came back home from university i feel i need to have shower.. Please guide me regarding these issues.. \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah subhanhu wa talaa in the Quran has ordained us to cover ourselves. The shariat did not leave us in the dark with regards to the Islamic etiquette of clothes. One will find complete chapters on this topic in the books of hadeeth. The most integral part of our dressing is that it should be very modest and should fulfill its purpose of covering one's body.\n\nJeans defeat that purpose by reveling the exact figure of the body.\n\nSo, our first advice would be that the an earnest effort should be made to wear more modest clothes. In the very unfortunate case in which no other dress can be worn, then as long as the body is completely covered, we hope that Allah will accept that salath.\n\n \n\nIs is best that one uses tissue as well as water. One may make use of a soft drink bottle or can to fill up water. For some reason, if a person does not have access to water, then completely drying one's self with tissue will suffice. There is no need to take a bath.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
