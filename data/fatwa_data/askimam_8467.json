  "question": "7694-Muslim man should steer away from marrying Muslim woman if that woman is barren a) What happens to that Muslim woman? pious, young, ready to marry, who are the men that are allowed to marry her?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe response in question 7694, states that a Muslim man should steer away from marrying a Muslim woman if that woman is barren. However, my questions are,(a) What happens to that Muslim woman? If she is pious, young and ready to marry, who are the men that are allowed to marry her? (b) Is she to only marry widowed men, or to only be a co-wife? (c) As a pious woman, should she turn down any proposals from good Muslim brothers, for their sake (in accordance with what is stated in sunnah?) (e) Should she ever get married?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is no problem in such a woman getting married despite her condition. It will not be wrong on her part if she accepts any particular proposal.\n\nThe Hadith would mean that it is better for one to marry a woman who is fertile though it would still be permissible to marry a barren woman. In fact, a woman who is infertile should still keep hope of Almighty Allah and use the various permissible methods in trying to conceive.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
