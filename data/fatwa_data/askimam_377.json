  "question": "Is it permissible to withhold knowledge when from a person, for fearthat they may misuse, misinterpret(unintentional due to a lack of foundationof knowledge), or unappropraitely apply it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it obligation to give knowledge when asked? For example, if someone asks if it is permissible for a wife to sing to a husband or her baby. Based on the character of the person asking the question , one is afraid the questioner may deduce that music and singing is permissible in all cases. However your answer was just in relationship to singing to the baby. If one feels his answer maybe misapplied, what should be done?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo withhold knowledge is a major sin. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) said, 'That person who asked about anything (in Shari'ah and\nconceals it), on the day of Qiyaamat, a reign of fire will be placed for\nhim.\n\nTo abuse knowledge is also a major sin. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu √Ålayhi\nWasallam) said, 'To give (Islamic) knowledge to an undeserving person is\nlike casting pearls on the neck of a swine.' Based on your example, it is\npermissible for the wife, mother to sing for the husband and child\nrespectively if there is no music played during singing.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
