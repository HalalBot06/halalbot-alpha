  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates, 'Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to set out for the Eid -Gah for Eid-ul-Fitr and Adhaa. The first thing he would do was to perform the Salaat then he would turn around and whilst facing the people, he would advise them. The people would remain seated in their rows.' (Bukhari Muslim)\n\n2. Hadhrat Jaabir ibn Samurah (Radhiallaahu Anhu) says, 'I read the Eid Salaat with Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) more than once without Adhaan and Iqaamat.' (Muslim)\n\n3. Hadhrat ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) says, 'Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and Abu Bakr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) and Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) used to perform the Eid Salaat before the Khutbah.' (Bukhari, Muslim)\n\nThere are a number of Ahaadith making mention of the Eid Salaat. The aforementioned three would suffice.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nÂ \nFATWA DEPT."
