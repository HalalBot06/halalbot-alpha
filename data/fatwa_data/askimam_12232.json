  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am 25 years old and have a problem i wish to share. I have a bad habit of watching gay pornography sites occasionally and cannot control my desires. Please help. I already have sent you a similar email but not received any reply as yet.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPornography is Haram (strictly prohibited). To be gay or associated to it is also Haraam. There is no need for us to discuss the evils of pornography and gay. You also state that it is a bad habit and you feel the guilt of being engaged in this evil act. %0D%0A%0D%0AWe commend you for your courage to discuss your shortcoming with the intention of reforming yourself. To be guilty of one?s shortcomings and making an endervour to reform oneself is the stepping stone for self reformation and success. One should never defend one?s shortcomings and never lose courage. That fact that we have Allah who is Merciful and so Forgiving, we have no to reason to be discouraged. Allah Ta?ala states, ?O` my slaves who have oppressed themselves, do not be despondent of the mercy of Allah?.%0D%0A%0D%0A1. The first step to reformation is intention. You understand that pornography is evil. You know to be gay is Haraam. You have to make a firm, strong and solid intention to abstain from it. That depends on the level of your sincerity. The more sincere you are, the more solid your intention to abstain will be. You cannot expect to abstain if you have no intention or weak intention.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. A human being is attracted to what he sees. He also uses things that are in his surroundings. It is difficult for a person wanting to quit smoking to be in the company of smokers. Similarly, keep away from computers or, at least, going onto the different sites. The more further you are away from it for some time, that will assist you to get out of the bad habit.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. You are in your youth. Guard yourself against the Shaytaan. Don?t you know that many males become gays due to their wrong association and inclinations. All that began somewhere. Today, they are so deep in it that they feel that is their natural self. Do you want to be a victim of that and be a gay. Do you want to incur the wrath of Allah on you? If not, what would you do when you witness fire approaching you?%0D%0A%0D%0A4. In order for you to resent the evil habit, I suggest you obtain some literature about the fire of hell and its severe punishments.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Obviously, as a Muslim, you should be punctual in the Musjid for the five Salaats and recite Qur?aan daily. Also obtain a copy of the Tafseer of Mufti Shafee, Ma?ariful Qur?aan, in English and educate yourself everyday.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. Most important, never keep yourself idle and free as that is the Shaytaan?s workshop.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
