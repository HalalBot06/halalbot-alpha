  "question": "Are coke and soft drinks haraam or mushkook(doubtful)? Please reply!",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI recently received a copy of Mujlisul Ulama 25 page document in english regarding their fatwa against comsumption of all coke and carbonated drinks due to the syrups being extracted with alcholic slovents. I read on your website other fatwas, but an still confused? Is it mushkook, halaal, haraam? are you a part of this Mujlesul Ulama? Do They have any email contact? I can also forward you the documents via email if necessary.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPrincipally, if the alcohol is extracted from grapes or dates it is not\npermissible. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, 'Khamr (wine) is\nfrom these two trees, dates and grapes.' (Mishkãt p. 317).\n\nFurthermore, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, 'Alcohol itself\nis prohibited and intoxication in every other beverage.' (Hidaaya vol. 4 p.\n497).\n\nIn view of the abovementioned Hadith, since the alcohol in coke is from\nethanol which is fermented from sugar cane mollasses and does not\nintoxicate, it is permissible. However, if one is doubtful, he may exercise\nprecaution and abstain.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
