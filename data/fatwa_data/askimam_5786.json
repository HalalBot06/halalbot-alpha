  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu-Alaikum Mufti Saheb I intend buying a house through Albarakah bank . Is their form of finance in accordance with Shariat ? Was Salaam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo the best of our knowledge, Albarakah Bank purchases the house and resells\nit at a profit, which is shared with their shareholders according to the\nMudhaarabah partnership.\n\nThe concept is correct. We advise you enquire from the bank their procedure\nin doing so and forward that to us. We shall comment thereafter.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
