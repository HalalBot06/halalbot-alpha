In%0D%0Aevery time and era scientists have made strange discoveries of the creation%0D%0Aof Allah and they will continue to do so. However, the research of the%0D%0Ascientists will be exhausted yet they will never be able to conquer the%0D%0Areality of the creations of Allah, nor will they be able to discover even a%0D%0Afraction of the entire creation.%0D%0AHowever, the creation of Allah is a manifestation of the Power of Allah.%0D%0AAllah invites us to ponder upon His creation and understand His Power. With%0D%0Aregard to aliens and flying objects, since the reality of these objects are%0D%0Anot known, it is not possible to comment upon them. For our belief, if there%0D%0Ais reality in those objects, it should be seen as another manifestation of%0D%0AAllah's Power.%0D%0A%0D%0AQuestion 2%0D%0AThe souls of pious people rest in Illiyyeen (a sacred place in the heavens)%0D%0Aand the souls of disbelievers and the sinful are kept in Sijjeen (a place at%0D%0Athe bottom of earth).%0D%0A%0D%0AQuestion 3%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, Allah Ta'ala said, 'I have%0D%0Aprepared for my pious slaves such bounties that no eye has seen, no ear has%0D%0Aheard and the thought of such bounties have not crossed any heart.' After%0D%0Aquoting this Hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Recite%0D%0Athis verse if you wish.' And for you in Jannah are those bounties which you%0D%0Asoul desires.'%0D%0A%0D%0AHereunder is a brief description of paradise:%0D%0AThe gound of paradise will be of Saffron. The sand on the ground of Jannah%0D%0A(saffron) will be of pebbles and rubies. The bricks of the palaces in Jannah%0D%0Awill be of gold and silver. The cement between the bricks will be of strong%0D%0Amusk. The thickness of the carpets in those palaces will be equivalent to%0D%0Athe journey of 500 years. The gardens outside the palaces will have streams%0D%0Aflowing beneath them.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe streams of Jannah will be crystal clear water, of pure milk, and of%0D%0Ahoney. There will be no evil, anger, pride, jealousy, etc. in Jannah. Upon%0D%0Aenjoying the food and fruits in Jannah, there will be no need to relieve%0D%0Aoneself. Passing wind and sweat will be sufficient for digestion. The%0D%0Agreatest bounty in Jannah will be the announcement from Allah about His%0D%0Aeternal Ridhaa (pleasure) for the dwellers of Jannah.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala says in the noble Qur'aan, 'And the Ridhwaan of Allah Ta'ala is%0D%0Athe greatest. The greatest pleasure of Jannah can be achieved by one doing%0D%0Aacts of virtue for the sole pleasure of Allah, thus making his life on earth%0D%0Aor brief experience of the greatest pleasure in Jannah.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Almighty grant us all His Ridhwaan and enterance into Jannah,%0D%0AAameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
