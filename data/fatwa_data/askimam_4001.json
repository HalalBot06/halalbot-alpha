  "question": "Please clarify both statements in details, Should Muslims except that?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1.> His title, \"Amirul Momineen,\" has not been adopted by any Muslim anywhere for nearly 1000 years. 2.> In 1996, as Taliban fervor increased, Omar accepted the title of \"Amirul Momineen,\" or \"commander of the faithful,\" in an emotional meeting in Kandahar where he appeared on a balcony above thousands of cheering Taliban, wrapping himself in a cloak said to belong to the Prophet Mohammad. The cloak had not been removed from its Kandahar shrine in 60 years, and had never been worn before. Omar is the first Muslim since the Fourth Caliph, a nephew of Prophet Mohammad, to publicly accept the Amirul title, a ranking in Islam nearly second to the Prophet.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAmeerul Mu'mineen literally means, the leader of the believers. It is a\ncommon practice for people around the world to appoint leaders for their\ngroups, organisations and countries.\n\nThe leaders are given a title of 'President', 'Prime Minister', etc.\nSimilarly, the believers of Afghanistan have appointed Mullah Omar as their\nleader, therefore, he is by appointment, a leader of the believers of\nAfghanistan - Ameerul Mu'mineen Mullah Omar (may Allah protect him), Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
