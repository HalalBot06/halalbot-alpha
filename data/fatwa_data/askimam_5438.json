  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaam u Alaikum Mufti Sahib. In our masjid some people do masah over cotton socks and they may be lead the prayer. In this case what should I do if; 1) If I have seen them do this, 2) If I have not seen him but have known him to do this Also some people while offering salat raise their hands to say Salaam when someone enters the mosque and says Assalaam u Alaikum loudly. What should I do in this case if the person is the Imam. In all above cases it is not possible to say anything to the Imam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is not permissible to make masah over the socks that are worn nowadays\nmade from cotton, wool, nylon etc. You should therefore, not follow such an\nImam.\n\n2. When one replies to someone's salaam whilst in salaat, his salaat becomes\nnull and void. If the Imaam did so, the congregational salaat will break and\nhence has to be repeated.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
