  "question": "i am righting as i am confused as to what is a memon,surtee.etc.i intend marrying a memon girl but as i am not memon her dad does not want me for her.is this correct.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn your first statement, you enquire what is Memon, Surtee, etc. In your subsequent statement, you seem to know the difference between the two as you intend getting married to a Memon.\n\nAccording to the Shari?ah, if there is non-compatibility (adam-e-Kafaat) between the boy and girl, and the girl gets married to such a boy, the validity of the Nikah will depend on the permission of the girl?s father. Nikah is an institution that has implications beyond the union marriage couples. The families of the couples are also taken into consideration.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
