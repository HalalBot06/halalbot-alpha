  "question": "What of the salaat of a person whose hands and feet have been amputated?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti, If a person's hands and feet have been cut off is it still fard upon him to perform salaat? If so, does he have to perform wudu as usual? If yes then is it fard upon him to find someone who will be able to help him in performing wudu?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. A person whose hands and feet are cut off is not absolved from the\nobligation of Salaat. He is still required to perform Salaat. If he does not\nhave anyone to wash his face and make Masah of his head, he will be excused\nfrom that only, not from Salaat.\n2. Yes. It will be Fardh on him to perform Wudhu as long as water does not\ncause harm to his wounds. Surely that person has someone to take care of him\nin fulfilling his basic needs like eating, cleansing, etc. Similarly, he\nshould seek assistance in making Wudhu for himself. (Nurul Idhaah pg.102)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
