How should a muslim man conduct himself when dealing with a women at work?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer below our standard reply to similar queries.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'A person does not seclude himself\nwith a woman except that the third one is the Shaytaan.' (Targheeb part3\npg.38).\n\nIt is, therefore, extremely important for a person to exercise great\nprecaution in getting into contact with strange women. You should avoid it\nunder all circumstances. Rather, you should seek alternate venues or make\nsome type of agreement with the woman so that you do not clash or come into\ncontact with each other."
