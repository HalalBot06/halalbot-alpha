  "question": "Does Tahneek have to be performed immediately after the birth of the child?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease advise me regarding the practice of Tahneek. The father is afraid that he is too sinful in nature to perform Tahneek personally and wishes to request an Aalim to perform this on his new-born child. My questions are as follows:\n\nDoes Tahneek have to be performed immediately after the birth of the child?\nIn the case where the hospital does not allow any visitors except the father, can this practice be delayed until after the mother and baby have been discharged from hospital? (approx. 3 days)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nTahneek is the Sunnah of Rasulullah (Salalaahu Alayhi Wasallam). It is not necessary for the Tahneek to be done immediately after birth. It could be done after a few days as well. It is important to note that the health of the baby should also be taken into consideration. Sometimes the item on which Tahneek is made could have reverse effect on the child.\n\nFurthermore, if you would wish for the Tahneek to take place immediately, you could request an Alim or pious person to make the Tahneek before and present it to the child after birth. It is not necessary for the person making the Tahneek to be present at the hospital.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
