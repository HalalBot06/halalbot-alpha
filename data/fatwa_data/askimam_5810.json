  "question": "regarding Hizb-ut-Tahreer - Could you tell me about their beleifs in detail?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nCould you tell me about their beleifs in detail?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSahih Aqeedah (correct beliefs) are a necessity of faith (Imaan) and are a%0D%0Adefinite criterion between Imaan and Kufr. It was for this very reason that%0D%0Athe Ulama had initiated the compilation of Aqaaid 1200 years ago.%0D%0A%0D%0ANowadays, many propounders of Baatil (falsehood) are putting forth their%0D%0Acorrupt theories for no reason other than to facilitate fulfilment of their%0D%0Abase desires. By the Fadhl (grace) of Allah, this was long ago anticipated%0D%0Aby the Ulama who worked to keep the Aqaaid of Deen pure and unadulaterated.%0D%0AThis latest falsehood being promulgated by the Hizb al-Tahreer is in fact%0D%0Anothing new or unecountered by the Ulama of Deen. Some of the Baatil being%0D%0Apromulgated by them is, in fact the same as originated by the Mu'tazila 12%0D%0Acenturies ago and more recently by the Jamaat Islaami of Pakistan. The Ulama%0D%0Ahave successfully repelled both these and numerous other attempts to%0D%0Aadulterate the pristine purity of Islam and will, Insha Allah, continue to%0D%0Ado so.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
