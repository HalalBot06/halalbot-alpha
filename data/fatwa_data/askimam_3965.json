  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen I was approximately 13 years of age, I am currently 23, I had a dream in which I was crossing a wooden bridge. In my dream I had knowledge that this was pul-siraat. As I was crossing the bridge going over the hellfire, the bottom gave out from underneath me and I barely hung on before I awoke. I have been too ashamed to ever ask anyone to interpret this dream, if you could please tell me its meaning. Jazakhallahu khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream indicates that you will be saved from the fire of Jahannum (hell)\nif you obey the orders of Allah Ta'ala and the Sunnah of Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
