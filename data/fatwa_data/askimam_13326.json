  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWill reading 500 times durood help me getting married fast? I am 24yrs old & still single.\n\nmy parents are tensed about my marriage and I myself feel lonley at times. please clarify, if 500 times durood recitation is sufficient. Thanks!\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAt the outset, we wish to point out that our Imaan is on Taqdeer. That is the absolute knowledge of Allah. It is only Allah Alone who knows when you will get married and to who you will get married. This is a world of Asbaab and means. We should adopt means that are acceptable in Shari’ah to fulfil our needs.\n\nIn light of the above, you should make an effort to look for a compatible marriage partner. You should not falter in adopting means for marriage. Make du’aa to Allah to put barakah in your effort. The 500 times Salaat and Salaam (Durood) to Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] invokves the mercy of Allah. It is tried and tested through experiences of many people that if one adopt means, make du’aa and also adopt certain forms of Dhikr like the 500 times Salaat and Salaam to Rasulullah[sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], Allah puts barakah in one’s effort. After all, the issue is of Taqdeer. Adopt everything possible and permissible in Shari’ah to marry and then place your trust in Allah. He knows what is best for you.\n\nWe make du’aa that Allah grant you good compatible marriage partner, aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
