  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) Regarding the rock Shia?s pray on, who started it, when, and what is the philosophy they had for doing so? 2) Is it permissible to listen to Qur?an or while working out (blocks out gym music)? 3) Does salat become invalid if there is a hair(s) from a dog on my clothes while I pray?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Shi?as according to us are not even considered Muslims because of their Baatil (false) beliefs in Aqeedah. There is thus no consideration of how they pray.\n\n2. The Qur?aan is the direct speech of Allah. Total respect should be shown at all times whether reciting the Qur?aan, listening to it or even discussing any verse of the Qur?aan. Listening to it while working out will be disrespectful as the mind is distracted and will not be able to fully concentrate on the recitation of the noble Qur?aan. You should try and work out where there is no music or rather listen to Islamic Nazms to block out the gym music.\n\n3. Saliva of a dog is impure. However, the dog itself is not impure. If a dog touches anyone?s clothes or body, it will not become impure unless there was some impurities on the dog. If an impure dog brushes by a person?s clothes, he should not read Salaat in them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
