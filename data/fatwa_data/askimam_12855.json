  "question": "Most of the prayers are prayed in masajid as soon as the prayer time starts. Some masajid pray Fajr late; is there any validation in Islam for delaying Fajr prayer in masjid.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThose who perform the Salaat at the onset of the time are perhaps adherents of the Shaafi?ee Madhab or alternatively, the times are structured for the convenience of the Musallees.\n\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, it is preferable to delay the Fajr Salaat until it is relatively bright. This delay is also proven from the Hadith. A delay of upto about 30-45 minutes before sunrise is normally accepted.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
