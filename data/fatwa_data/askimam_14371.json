  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know if its permissible for me to borrow interest money to my brother. his business liquidated. I have cashflow problems. so can i use interst money?\n\nI would like to know if its permissible for me to borrow interest money to my brother. He has been asking me for financial help and I was helping him with whatever I could several times, but he never mentions of returning the money and I never say anything to him because he my brother. Now he has gone bankrupt and his business closed and all his assets e.g cars, shop and his own house has been taken by the bank. He approached me asking for some kind of loan. He wants to start a new business, and he needs a lot of money. At the present moment my company is having a cashflow problem, but I have some interest money which I can give him. Am I allowed to do this? He got 3kids and at the moment, he cant even afford to buy food and clothes. He is staying with my mother and other brother. What should I do?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to Shariah, one is required to dispose of interest to the poor and needy who are eligible to accept Zakaat. The financial conditions of your brother described by you will make him eligible to accept the interest. Therefore, you may assist him with that money.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
