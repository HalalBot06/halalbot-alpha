  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nI am  facing problem of unemployment for last one year. In India I can found a job in BPO (Business Process Outsourcing ) or Call Centre  in BPO if I get work I have to work for any bank or insurance company which is located in America or Europe(outsource Work) but its not directly concern with bank etc. and I get the salary from Company which get this work in India on a contractual basis. So it’s Jaiz for me? My earning is Halal? If I get job in Call Centre then it’s a voice process and same situation but we have to reply query of customer and solute their problem its call inbound process and in Outbound process we have to sell their product to customer i.e. Credit Card, Mortgage etc. so its Jaiz for me?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\n \n\nWe understand from your query that two job opportunities are available to you. One is at the BPO and the other at a Telemarketing Company which deals with inbound and outbound calls.\n\n \n\n1. BPO (Business Process Outsourcing):\n\nYou have stated that your employment will be to work for a bank or an insurance company based in America or Europe. You also stated that your job is not directly concerned with the bank. However, you have not stated what your job at the bank or insurance company entails. Hence, we are unable to issue a direct ruling. Explain to us the description of your job there.\n\n \n\n2. Telemarketing Company (Inbound and Outbound):\n\n \n\n - Inbound Process:\n\nThe inbound process requires one to answer calls of clients and assist them in their queries. These queries vary according to the company for whom this service is done. At times this service is rendered on behalf of banks. We do not see anything impermissible in this. However, care should be taken that one does not assist clients in anything un-Islamic. Such assistance will not be permissible.\n\n \n\n-Outbound Process:\n\nThe outbound process requires one to phone clients and promote certain products, like credit cards, mortgages etc. If these products are un-Islamic, it will not be permissible to promote them. Credit cards and mortgages potentially accrue interest. Thus, promoting them to clients will not be permissible. Allah Ta’ala states in the Quran:\n\nولا تعاونوا على الإثم والعدوان\n\n“And do not assist one another in sin and enmity”\n\nWe advise that you take temporary employment at the Telemarketing Company and render your services at the inbound process. You should be cautious and not support any un-Islamic activities. At the same time look for a better job opportunity. This will ensure a pure Halaal income.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa\n\nImportant Posts and Links\n\n \n\nShar'ii stance on Shares and Stocks|Have you prepared your WILL??|Moonsighting - Its that time to sight the moon"
