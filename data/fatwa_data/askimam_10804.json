  "question": "Based on the following Hadith, doesnâ€™t seem like we can forward reward (Isaal-e-Sawaab) to anyone other than our parents?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n?When the son of Adam dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity, beneficial knowledge, or a righteous son who will pray for him.? Narrated by Muslim. Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi and al-Nasaa?i, and by al-Bukhaari in al-Adab al-Mufrad from Abu Hurayrah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nUnfortunately, your analogy is incorrect because there is no such restriction mentioned in this Hadith.\n\nBesides, does this Hadith mean that one may only make du?aa for his deceased parents and no other deceased person? The answer to this will answer your query.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH SCIENCES\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
