  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nhow can i come over feelings for boys when i now im not gay it started right now before i used to like girls but it all stoped\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nYou should be shameful of having feelings for boys. Shaytaan has taken control of your feelings and is taking you towards being gay. You should fear Allah and life after death. Make Tawbah and seek Allah’s pardon. Furthermore, if you have reached a marriageable age, you must get married. It is Fardh for you to marry if you fear becoming involved in these types of filthy habits. You should also stay away from such boys who you fear being attracted to as Shaytaan will incline you towards them and trap you in sin.\n\nYou should search for a suitable, Allah fearing Alim who may confide in. Explain him your situation and he will guide and assist you. Until then perform your Salaah and be committed to Allah. Ignore all the whispers Shaytaan and remain in the company of the pious.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
