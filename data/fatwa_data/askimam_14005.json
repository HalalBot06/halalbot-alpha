  "question": "opinion that saying \"Ya Rasoolullah\" if one does not consider rasoolullah (S.A.W.) to be hazir wa nazir is alright",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like to ask is deoband a sect or school of thought. There are scholars who differ with deoband on some topics which the deobandis hold particular beliefs. For example, Many sunni ulema (not barelwi), of all four madhahib, are of the opinion that saying \"Ya Rasoolullah\" if one does not consider rasoolullah (S.A.W.) to be hazir wa nazir is alright. i.e. itdepends on nyat. Many sunni scholars from all four madhahib for example the Syrian trained hanafi scholars such as Sidi Faraz Rabbani of Sunnipath.com, consider saying 'Ya Rasoolullah madad\" permissible if the person believes that helper is only Allah and all power resides only with Him.Many sunni scholars also allow milad within some restrictions such as it should not be considered obligatory.\n    My question is not your opinion on these topics, rather i want to ask, are the scholars of sunnipath.com and other scholars of similar views across the world considered by deoband to be ahlussunah with difference of opinion with deoband, or are they considered ahlubid'ah and ulema-e-soo. Please note that Sidi Faraz Rabbani has good relations with several deobandi ulema who help him with his site.\nAre deobandis less tolerant of difference of opinion than others?\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe statement ‘Yaa Rasoolullah’ consists of two grammatical components. The first is the word ‘Yaa’ which is known as ‘Harf Nidaa’ (vocative particle). The second is the word Rasoolullah which will be considered as the ‘Munaada’ (the person being called). Arabic grammarians state that ‘Yaa’ is a particle which comes in place of the word ‘Unaadi’ which means ‘I am calling’ (Lisaanul Arab pg.506). Thus, the sentence ‘Yaa Rasoolullah’ would be translated as ‘I am calling you, Oh Prophet of Allah.’ It can be translated ‘Oh Rasoolullah’.\n\n‘Yaa’ is one of the eight different vocative particles of the Arabic language. Some of these particles are used solely for the purpose of calling unto someone who is far away whilst other particles are solely used for the purpose of calling those who are close by. However, the particle ‘Yaa’ can be used for both far and close. (Jaamin Durood Arabin vol.2 pg.106). Hence, grammatically, it would be correct to say ‘Yaa Rasoolullah’ when Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] is called upon whether close by or far away from the person calling unto him. However, this is permissible in regards to Arabic grammar only.\n\nThere is also the aspect of Aqaaid (ideology) that has to be considered as well. It is the belief of the Ahlus sunnah Wal Jamaa that Allah Ta’ala is One. He has no partner or equal and nothing resembles Him from His creation. (Aqeeda Tahawiy). Allah Ta’ala is Samee (the All-Hearing). Thus, nothing can resemble Allah Ta’ala in this attribute of being All-Hearing. Allah Ta’ala is also ‘Alaa kulli shay-in qadeer’ (able to do anything He please). Thus, if He wishes to allow someone to hear something, then he can permit it even though outwardly it might seem physically impossible. Bearing the above in mind, thus, it could be said that to say ‘Yaa Rasoolullah’ whilst being close to him, as in the case of visiting his blessed grave would be correct both grammatically and ideologically. Hence, the recommended Durood (salutation) which visiting is ‘Assalaamu alayka yaa Rasoolullah’. This is due to the fact that the belief of the Ahlus Sunnah is that Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] is alive in his blessed grave and as the authentic Ahaadith mention that angels present salutation of the Ummah to Rasoolullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam].\n\nOn the contrary, if a person says ‘Yaa Rasoolullah’ whilst being far away from him then although grammatically it would be correct, but if the person believes that Rasoolullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] can hear him due to him being All-Hearing or Haazir (omnipresent) or Naazir (All-Seeing) then such a statement and belief would be Kufr. This is due to the person attributing the sole qualities of Allah Ta’ala to His creation which is Shirk (polytheism). It is for this reason that the Ulama of Deoband had issued the Fatwa of Kufr upon such people who hold the view that Rasoolullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] is Haazir and Naadir.
