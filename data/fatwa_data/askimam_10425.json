  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) is it necessary for me to apologise to everyone i know or with whom i had sour relations with or with whom i misbehaved, or whom i caused pain? 2) what do i do before leaving for hajj with regards to my relatives and friends? 3) what do i do about my property before i go to hajj? 4) do i have to write a will about my assets before leaving for hajj?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1,2 & 3. It is not a condition of Haj that a person has to seek forgiveness from others, however as a Haji has all his sins forgiven except those committed against others, it would be better to get forgiveness from all those one has wronged and to put right ones relationship with everyone before leaving. One should also join ties with any relatives he might be having sour relations with.\n\nOne should also endeavor to make sure that all his debts are paid up, his zakaat has been given and that he has no Haraam wealth mixed up with his halaal wealth, as Haraam prevents ones duas from being answered.\n\n4. It is necessary for every person having wealth that he should have his will drawn up in an Islamic Manner. You should consult your local Ulama or Muslim Lawyers on how to draw up an Islamic will.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
