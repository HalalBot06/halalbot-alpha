  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIn my state in the US there is a larger controversy over whether chicken is Halal or not.  The local Halal butcher shops sell it as Halal, and say they hand cut the meat themselves.  However, the chicken is actually slaughter prior to arrival.  The place where it is slaughter also says its Halal.  What some brothers have found out that there is no guarentee that each and every chicken is Halal, that they come through on a machine and sometimes they go past without being Halaled.\n\nI have told people this and it raises a huge arguement.  Plus all the local Halal grocery stores have even said they guarentee their meat is Halal.  Can you settle this matter please?  What should we do?  So far since hearing this new we just don't eat chicken in my family.\n\nThank you.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to Shariah, if a reliable Adil (just) Muslim who is conscious of Halaal and haraam and knows the Shar’ie Laws of Halaal and Haraam informs you of the food being Halaal, the food will be Halaal. There is no need to then go and investigate his claim and cause division in the community. You may consult the local Ulama and seek their intervention into the matter. It is important that the matter is resolves as quickly as possible as the unity of the community can never to sacrificed.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
