  "question": "Is it right for masjids to ask for $8.00? What is the right amount for Zakatul-Fitr for United States?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nHere in the United States the Zakatul-Fitr is said to be $8.00 or $10.00 but after checking some sites about 1/2 saa of wheat it looks more like $2.50 or $3.00 max. Is it right for masjids to ask for $8.00? What is the right amount for Zakatul-Fitr for United States? Jazakallahu Khairan in advance for your response. And Peace and Blessing of Allah SWT be on Prophet Muhammad SAWS\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe are based in South Africa and do not know the exact amount of Sadaqatul Fitr in the US. You may consult the local Ulama of your area for guidance. However, if there are conflicting amounts of Sadaqatul Fitr, as a matter of precaution it is better to give the higher amount.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
