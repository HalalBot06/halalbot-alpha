  "answer": "QUESTION\nI dont get along with my father,I speak loudly to him now a days when his temper is high,He don't get along with my mother too,He says the biggest mistake of his life is \"Marriage\" even he advice this to visitors who visit us,I normally avoid him because we don't know about his mood at all,some times I feel like hitting him ,So plz tell what should I do to be in control?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour father, after all is still 'your father'. His existence is the means of\nyour existence.\n\nHe was the one that went through so much of difficulty and hardship in your\nupbringing and strove to get you food for the day. No matter what he does,\nhe is still your father and you will have to respect him. He may at times\nbecome angry and lose his temper. At such times, you should keep cool and\ncalm and avoid crossing his path till he calms down. Nevertheless, it is of\nutmost importance that you immediately make Tawbah, ask Allah Ta'ala for\nforgiveness and thereafter join ties with your father. Ask him also for\nforgiveness and be kind and polite towards him.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
