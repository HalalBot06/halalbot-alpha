  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a friend who had a habit of masturbating, but now has gradually stopped. However, he told me that once during fasting in shawal, having forgotten that he was fasting accidently masturbated. He wants to know what he has to do?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n‍At the outset, masturbation is a grave sin and your friend must abstain from committing such a heinous act even while not fasting. It is required that he make sincere tawbah from the sinful act by regretting the sin and making a firm conviction never to repeat it again.\n\nIf ejaculation was caused by masturbating it will nullify the fast and one will be required to make qadha of the fast. If ejaculation did not take place then there is no need to make qadha.\n\n \n\n( من غير كفارة ) لقصور معناه العذر وهو سبعة وخمسون شيئا تقريبا وهي... ( أو ) أنزل ( بتفخيذ أو بتبطين ) أو عبث بالكف ( أو ) أنزل من ( قبلة أو لمس ) لا كفارة عليه لم ذكرنا\n(حاشية الطحطاوي، 671-676، العلمية)\n\n( قوله : وكذا الاستمناء بالكف ) أي في كونه لا يفسد لكن هذا إذا لم ينزل أما إذا أنزل فعليه القضاء\n(رد المحتار، 2/ 399، سعيد)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
