  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWant to ask about inheritance from father who has been working in a bank\n\nInheriting (WIRASAT) money and property from father who was working in a bank. My father has been working in a bank(non-islamic bank). He got retired in 2000 and he built a house during his job and now he has some money he received after his retirement. I want to know about the validity of inheritage (WIRASAT) we will receive from him. Is it valid for me and my all siblings to receive it and spent it on ourselves and our kids? Allah hafiz I asked this question a few weeks ago and the question number was 18142 but you didn't reply me. I request to post a reply of my question, so that i could correct myself\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe issue of working in a bank is different from the issue of receiving salary from the bank.\n\nYour father’s house as well as his retirement package are both legitimate possessions in the Shari’ah. The inheritance on both will also be legitimate.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
