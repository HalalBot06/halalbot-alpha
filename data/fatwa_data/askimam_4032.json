  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalamu alaikum I live in the UK. I cant think of any business that doesnt deal with interest. Does this mean that it is a sin to work for these companies? Is it better to be unemployed?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo earn an income is compulsory. That can be achieved by adopting a Halaal\nself employment scheme. We also suggest you consult with Muslims of your\narea who are conscious of Halaal and Haraam and seek their advice.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
