  "question": "Since my marriage have been plagued with a nagging fear that a word or sentence I might say might lead to a divorce between us.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nTherefore a lot of times, after I have said something or thought of something I find myself thinking whether what I said meant divorce or not. I keep saying to myself did I mean by this that \"Im divorcing you\" or did I mean \"I divorced you\" till Im convinced that my intention was not divorce. However in this entire process of confirming my thought, I find a lot of times the words \" Im divorcing you\" is uttered with the intention of confirming that my thoughts were not of divorce. ometimes I also pretend intention and say the words like \"leave me\" just to make sure that I had no intention in the actual scenario. Will the mere utterance of the words to myself WITH ABSOLUTELY NO INTENTION EXCEPT FOR VALIDATION lead to a divorce. Im unable to eat or sleep. Please advice\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, the mere thought of divorce does not constitute divorce. The repeating of the words of divorce to yourself also does not constitute divorce.\n\nWe advise that since you are experiencing a problem of doubts and your thoughts and actions are due to the doubts, you should inform two reliable Muslim males about your problem so that they can bear testimony on your behalf whenever the need arises that you did not intend to issue divorce.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
