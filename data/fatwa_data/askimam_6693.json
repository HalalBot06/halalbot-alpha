  "question": "The problem is his parents want him to marry someone else and my parents dont like him because he is uneducated and so on.....",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a 19 year old sunni girl and i want to marry a sunni male that is 20 years of age. The problem is his parents want him to marry someone else and my parents dont like him because he is uneducated and so on..... I know i can spend the rest of my life with him, but my or his parents will never accept us. We have been intimate once and we regret this alot, but to stop us committing any more sins we are thinking of getting married without our parents consent. I heard that we only need an imam and two male witnesses, is this correct? and also if we did do this would our nikah be valid? Is this the right thing to do? Please could you reply bak asap....as i am so stressed and need advice. Thank you Allah Hafiz\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Since both of you are adults, the validity of your Nikah is not subject to your parent?s consent and approval. If you do marry him, your Nikah will be valid.\n\n2. Yes, two male witnesses are sufficient for the validity of the Nikah. However, since the objective is also to inform the public of your future union and relationship as man and wife, it is best to hold the Nikah publicly in the Musjid, etc. and not a ?secret? Nikah as this defeats the purpose.\n\n3. We suggest you approach your parents or get someone else to approach them. Explain your situation and express your feelings and intentions. It is best to get their blessing.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
