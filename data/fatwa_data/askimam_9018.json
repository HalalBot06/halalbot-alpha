If so, you should discuss the matter with your seniors and if they approve of your choice, your intention may be communicated to him through some male members of your family.\n\nHe may respond positively or otherwise and you will know your position from his response. There is no point in liking somebody for marrying and keeping that to yourself as there is a strong possibility of the Shaytaan playing with your Nafs. If the person is interested, exercise precaution before committing yourself to him. If he is not, then move on with your life as there is no point in concentrating on the person. Allah will grant you whatever is best for you in His infinite and absolute knowledge.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
