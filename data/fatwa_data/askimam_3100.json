  "question": "Suyuti, Qadi Ayad, Ali Qari, Abdul Haq, Shah Waliullah all say that the Prophet is Haadir wa Naadir. The above Ulema believe that the Prophet is Omnipresent.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe above Ulema believe that the Prophet is Omnipresent, so why do people shout 'Shirk' when Muslims talk about Haadir wa Naadir? There are many other Ulema but I thought I'd just name a few to start with. Jazak Allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nHaazir (Omnipresent) and Naazir (Omniseeing) are the sole attributes of\nAllah.\n\nNo human being including our Nabiy (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) can be\nHaazir and Naazir. Our beloved Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is\nresting in Madinah Munawwarah. He informed us that when anyone sends Salaams\nto him, the angels convey the Salaam to him there.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
