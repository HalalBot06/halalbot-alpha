Please reply soon with advices..\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is an accepted fact that by you joining the so-called security team, you are going to be interacting with people of the opposite gender which is prohibited.\n\nTherefore, we suggest you seek some alternate job where you will not be exposed to the opposite gender and not interact with them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
