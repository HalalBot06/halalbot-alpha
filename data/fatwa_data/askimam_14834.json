  "question": "Is Hajj Fardh upon me?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nIf someone makes Taubah then how will he proceed if he has the following things to make up for. \n\n1. He has just about enough money to perform Hajj. \n\n2. But some of this money does not rightfully belong to him for he had wronged someone or that some\n\n of this money is from a Haraam source of income. \n\n3. He also has to give Zakaat for the past several years. \n\n4. He also has to give Sadqah Fitr for the past several years. \n\n5. He also has to give as sadqah an amount equivalent to the price of slaughter animals for the past\n\n several years in which the animal slaughter was wajib on him on the occasions of Eid-ul-Adhaa.  \n\nCan it be said that Hajj had become Fardh on him? In which order must such a person proceed.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nIf a person just acquires sufficient money to perform hajj, and part of the money belongs to someone else, or earned from haraam, then such amount will be deducted from the acquired amount. Similarly, the Zakaah and Sadaqatul Fitr and Qurbani monies of the past year will be deducted.\n\nIf after all these deductions, the balance is not sufficient to perform hajj, hajj will not be compulsory.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
