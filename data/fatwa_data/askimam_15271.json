Saeed Company\n\nFatawa al-Hindiya (1:353) Maktaba Rasheediya\n\n- (ويقع طلاق كل زوج بالغ عاقل) ولو تقديرا بدائع ، ليدخل السكران (ولو عبدا أو مكرها) فإن طلاقه صحيح لا إقراره بالطلاق (در المختار)\n\n- (فصل فيمن يقع طلاقه وفيمن لا يقع طلاقه) يقع طلاق كل زوج إذا كان بالغا عاقلا سواء كان حرا أو عبدا طائعا أو مكرها كذا في الجوهرة النيرة\n\n \n\n3.  Please refer to the previous answer from our institute regarding this topic.  It has been reproduced hereunder from your convenience.  \n\nFatwa # 15068\n\nThe issue of extreme anger leading to temporary insanity has been discussed by the scholars in the past. Hereunder is the ruling: \n\nAnger is categorized into 3 stages:\n\nThe person in anger is in total control of his state of affairs and knows what he is doing and saying. Talaq given in such a state is valid.\nAnger leads the person to temporary insanity and the mental thinking is distorted. Talaq is invalid in such a state.\nOne that is between the above mentioned two stages. i.e. one is not in total control of his state of affairs, but does not reach the stage of insanity. There is a difference of opinion on talaq given in this state, but the most correct opinion is that talaq will be valid. Raddul Muhtar Vol:3 Pg:244 (H.M. Saeed Company)\n\nقلت : وللحافظ ابن القيم الحنبلي رسالة في طلاق الغضبان قال فيها : إنه على ثلاثة أقسام : أحدها أن يحصل له مبادئ الغضب بحيث لا يتغير عقله ويعلم ما يقول ويقصده ، وهذا لا إشكال فيه . والثاني أن يبلغ النهاية فلا يعلم ما يقول ولا يريده ، فهذا لا ريب أنه لا ينفذ شيء من أقواله . الثالث من توسط بين المرتبتين بحيث لم يصر كالمجنون فهذا محل النظر ، والأدلة على عدم نفوذ أقواله .ا هـ . ملخصا من شرح الغاية الحنبلية ، لكن أشار في الغاية إلى مخالفته في الثالث حيث قال : ويقع الطلاق من غضب خلافا لابن القيم ا هـ وهذا الموافق عندنا لما مر في المدهوش\n\nIt is understood from the above mentioned that talaq given in anger will not be valid only when the person has reached insanity. Therefore, the reason for talaq not being valid is insanity and not anger.\n\nMoreover, the issue of talaq is a very delicate one; so it will not be appropriate to make a general statement that talaq given in extreme anger is invalid. However, if it is proven by a reliable source that the person did reach the status of insanity, then the Islamic scholars can analyze the situation and render the talaq invalid.\n\n(Answered by Ml Jawed Iqbal.
