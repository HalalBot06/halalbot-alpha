  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question is about the Dua after the Adhan. I've heard various versions where people add more at the end of the dua , such as sending salawat upon the Prophet (saw), is this allowed? If adding the extra parts is biddah, how can this compare to the other adhkar that is allowed within the Sharia provided by the Sufiyah?\n\n Also, what does the term Waseelah mean in this dua? I've heard two differenr variations among the Ulema of Deoband, could you please verify the proper definition this with sources?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAbdullah bin Amar bin Aas Radiallahu Anhu narrates that Rasulullah (Salalaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said \"When you hear the Muazzin then reply to him in the same way as he has said thereafter send salawat upon me for whoever sends salaat unto me, Allah will shower him ten times (with mercy), thereafter ask Allah to grant me Waseela, it is a stage in Jannah which is reserved for only one person and I hope that it is me, whoever asks Allah to grant me Waseela, I will intercede for him (Mishkaat Pg.65)\n\nFrom the above Hadith it is clear that it is Sunnat to send Salaawat unto Nabi after Azaan and it is not a Bid’ah. Waseela is clarified in the Hadith. It is a stage in Jannat specially reserved for Nabi ().\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
