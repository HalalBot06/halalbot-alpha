By commiting a sin a person becomes a faasiq; but at times fighting with a person could lead him to utter such statements which will make him a kaafir. You should rather get an Alim to discuss this issue with your husband. Hopefully he will abandon the action.\n\n \n\nAs for the ruling of your nikah, it will depend on the exact words which your husband has uttered. Kindly explain to us what do you mean by abuse? What were the exact words that he uttered?\n\nAlternatively, refer this issue to a local Alim (scholar) who can analyse the issue and pass an appropriate ruling.\n\nحاشية ابن عابدين - (1 / 81 سعيد)\n\nبل قالوا لو وجد سبعون رواية متفقة على تكفير المؤمن ورواية ولو ضعيفة بعدمه يأخذ المفتي والقاضي بها دون غيرها\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
