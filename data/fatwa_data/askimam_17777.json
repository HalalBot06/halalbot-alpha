  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nmy Question is  We had baught a TV and I have a extra mobile phone . If I sale then other person will use it as a sin works . What I will do now?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nYour query is unclear. According to our understanding, you bought a TV and received a free mobile phone. You now intend to sell the mobile phone since it is extra.\n\nFirstly it should be noted, as a Muslim it is not permissible to buy a T.V set.\n(Ahsanul Fatawa vol.8 pg306, HM Saeed)\n\nAs far as mobile phones are concerned, it is permissible to buy and sell. You can either sell the mobile phone or keep it for your own personal use. \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by: \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
