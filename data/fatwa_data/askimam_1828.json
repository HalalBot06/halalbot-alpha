  "question": "I was wondering whether or not finishing the whole Quran in taraweeh prayers is something that Umar (r) established? Is it a sunnah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMany people say that finishing Quran in tarawih is a must for them, and when they do at a mosque they end up reading really fast, and the Quran can't be understood. I was wondering if finishing the Quran in tarawih was something the sahaba established and was it continued by them.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe sahaba (RA) used to perform taraweeh salaah in different groups. Umar (RA)\nadvised them to perform the taraweeh joinly and appointed Ubai(RA) to lead\nthat congregation. The fuqaha have ruled that it is sunnah to complete the\nrecitation of the Quran once in taraweeh salaah. ( Hidaya vol 1) Obviously,\nin doing so, the etiquettes of reciting the quran correctly must be adhered\nto.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
