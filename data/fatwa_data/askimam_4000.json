Mu'aadh ibn Jabal (Radhiallaahu Anhu) says that when Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) sent him (as a governor) to the Yemen. He%0D%0Asaid, 'Beware of living in comfort and luxury, for the pious bondsmen of%0D%0AAllah do not live in comfort and luxury.' (Fadhaail-e-Sadaqaat pg.527)%0D%0A2. When sending Mu'aadh ibn Jabal (Radhiallaahu Anhu) to Yemen as a%0D%0Agovernor, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised him to command%0D%0Apeople to observe Salaat and to pay Zakaat, and then said, 'When they pay%0D%0AZakaat, avoid taking the best of their property; and protect yourself%0D%0Aagainst the curse of an oppressed person, for there is no barrier between%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala and the supplication of the oppressed.' (Fadhaail-e-Sadaqaat%0D%0Apg.298)%0D%0A3. When Allah's Messenger (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) sent him to the%0D%0AYemen, he went out with him giving him advice, Mu'adh (Radhiallaahu Anhu)%0D%0Ariding and Allah's Messenger (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) walking beside%0D%0Ahis riding beast.%0D%0AThen when he finished he said, \"Perhaps, Mu'adh, you may not meet me after%0D%0Athis year, but perhaps, you may pass this mosque of mine and my grave.\"%0D%0AMu'adh wept from grief over the departure of Allah's Messenger (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam).%0D%0AThe Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) then turned facing Medina and%0D%0Asaid, \"Those nearest to me are the pious, whoever they are and whenever they%0D%0Aare.\" (Mishkaat)%0D%0A4. Allah's Apostle (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said to Mu'adh when he sent%0D%0Ahim to Yemen, \"You will go to the people of the scripture. So when you reach%0D%0Athere, invite them to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but%0D%0AAllah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0AAnd if they obey you in that, tell them that Allah has enjoined on them five%0D%0Aprayers in each day and night. And if they obey you in that tell them that%0D%0AAllah has made it obligatory on them to pay the Zakat which will be taken%0D%0Afrom the rich among them and given to the poor among them.%0D%0AIf they obey you in that, then avoid taking the best of their possessions,%0D%0Aand be afraid of the curse of an oppressed person because there is no screen%0D%0Abetween his invocation and Allah.\"%0D%0A5. Allah's Messenger (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) sent AbuMusa and Mu'adh%0D%0Aibn Jabal (Radhiallaahu Anhuma) to Yemen. He sent each of them to administer%0D%0Aa province as Yemen consisted of two provinces.%0D%0AThe Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said (to them), \"Facilitate things%0D%0Afor the people and do not make things difficult for them (Be kind and%0D%0Alenient both of you with the people, and do not be hard on them). Give the%0D%0Apeople good tidings and do not repulse them.\"%0D%0ASo each of them went to carry out his job. When either of them toured his%0D%0Aprovince and happened to come near (the border of the province of) his%0D%0Acompanion, he would visit him and greet him.%0D%0AOnce Mu'adh toured that part of his state which was near (the border of the%0D%0Aprovince of) his companion, AbuMusa. Mu'adh came riding his mule till he%0D%0Areached AbuMusa and saw him sitting, and the people had gathered around him.%0D%0ABehold! There was a man tied with his hands behind his neck.%0D%0AMu'adh said to AbuMusa, \"O Abdullah ibn Qays! What is this?\" AbuMusa%0D%0Areplied. \"This man has reverted to Heathenism (kufr) after embracing Islam.\"%0D%0AMu'adh said, \"I will not dismount till he is killed.\" AbuMusa replied, \"He%0D%0Ahas been brought for this purpose, so get down.\" Mu'adh said, \"I will not%0D%0Adismount till he is killed.\" So AbuMusa ordered that he be killed, and he%0D%0Awas killed.%0D%0AThen Mu'adh dismounted and said, \"O Abdullah (ibn Qays)! How do you recite%0D%0Athe Qur'an?\" AbuMusa said, \"I recite the Qur'an regularly at intervals and%0D%0Apiecemeal. How do you recite it, Mu'adh?\"%0D%0AMu'adh said, \"I sleep in the first part of the night and then get up after%0D%0Ahaving slept for the time devoted for my sleep and then recite as much as%0D%0AAllah has written for me. So I seek Allah's reward for my sleep as well as%0D%0Amy prayer (at night).\"%0D%0A6. When the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) sent him (Mu'aadh) to the%0D%0AYemen, he ordered him to take a male or a female calf a year old for every%0D%0Athirty cattle and a cow in its third year for every forty, and one dinar for%0D%0Aevery adult (unbeliever as a poll-tax) or cloths of equivalent value%0D%0Amanufactured in the Yemen.%0D%0A7. When the Apostle of Allah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) sent him (Mu'%0D%0Aaadh) to the Yemen, he said (to him): Collect corn from the corn, sheep from%0D%0Athe sheep, camel from the camels, and cow from the cows. (Abu Dawud)%0D%0A8. When the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) sent him (Mu'aadh) to the%0D%0AYemen, he ordered to take from everyone who had reached puberty one dinar or%0D%0Aits equivalent in Mu'afiri garment of Yemen origin. (Abu Dawud)%0D%0A9. Some companions of Mu'adh ibn Jabal said: When the Apostle of Allah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) intended to send Mu'adh ibn Jabal to the%0D%0AYemen, he asked: How will you judge when the occasion of deciding a case%0D%0Aarises?%0D%0AHe replied: I shall judge in accordance with Allah's Book. He asked: (What%0D%0Awill you do) if you do not find any guidance in Allah's Book? He replied:%0D%0A(I shall act) in accordance with the Sunnah of the Apostle of Allah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0AHe asked: (What will you do) if you do not find any guidance in the Sunnah%0D%0Aof the Apostle of Allah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and in Allah's Book?%0D%0AHe replied: I shall do my best to form an opinion and I shall spare no%0D%0Aeffort.%0D%0AThe Apostle of Allah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) then patted him on the%0D%0Abreast and said: Praise be to Allah Who has helped the messenger of the%0D%0AApostle of Allah to find something which pleases the Apostle of Allah. (Abu%0D%0ADawud)%0D%0A10. Allah's Messenger (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) sent me (Mu'aadh) to the%0D%0AYemen, but when I set off he sent after me and I was brought back.%0D%0AHe then said, \"Do you know why I sent for you? Do not take anything without%0D%0Amy permission, for it is unfaithful dealing, and he who acts unfaithfully%0D%0Awill come on the Day of Resurrection with the unfaithful deeds he has done.%0D%0AThis is why I called you. Now go off to your task.\" (Mishkaat)%0D%0A11. When Allah's Messenger (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) sent him (Mu'aadh)%0D%0Ato the Yemen, he said, \"Beware of living sumptuously, for Allah's servants%0D%0Ado not live sumptuously.\" (Mishkaat)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
