  "question": "Regarding Q# 3530 and Q# 5159. Both the questions have different methods of cutting oneâ€™s nails. Please clarify which is mustahab, or are they both mustahab?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n2. Is it prohibited to cut nails at maghrib time or right before maghrib. Or is it just biddat/ superstition? 3. What is the reason that women have to stay in iddat and they have to wear dark clothes, not do makeup, not remarry and all the other things they she can usually do are not allowed during iddat? Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Hafiz ibn Hajar (RA) has said that there is no specific order established\nby Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) in clipping of the finger nails.\nHence, both mentioned methods could be adopted as they have been recorded by\nthe pious elders. We have not come across any Shar'ee reference.\n2. It is not prohibited to clip the nails at the time of Maghrib Salaat.\n3. A woman in Iddat is required to express her grief and sadness. Adorning\nherself is contrary to that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
