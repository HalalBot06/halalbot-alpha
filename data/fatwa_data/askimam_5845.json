  "answer": "QUESTION\nplease list all the sunnah and fard of every salah so that I can only do the fard while making up for 6 years of qada salaat...qada salaat for 6 years\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour zeal to perform your daily Salaat is encouraging. May Allah Ta'ala%0D%0Agrant us steadfastness, Aameen. In principle, Salaat and other obligations%0D%0Aof Shari'ah becomes compulsory when a person becomes Baaligh (mature). In%0D%0Athe case of a female, when she experiences Haydh (menses) and in the case of%0D%0Aa male when he experiences nocturnal emission (wet dream). If one does not%0D%0Aexperience the signs of physical maturity then he%2Fshe will be declated%0D%0Amatured from the age of 15 according to the lunar calendar. If you became%0D%0ABaaligh before 15 and did not perform Fardh Salaat, you have to make Qadhaa%0D%0Afor the missed Salaats of that period. There is no Qadhaa for Sunnat and%0D%0ANafl Salaats. We advise you adopt any procedure most suitable and easy for%0D%0Ayou to make Qadhaa of your missed Salaats, for example, one Qadhaa with each%0D%0Atimely Salaat. It is not prohibited to make Sunnah and Nafl Salaats while%0D%0Amaking Qadhaa Salaat. The Sunnat-e-Muakkadah before and after Fardh Salaat%0D%0Ais a must in any way.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AQ: Kindly explain in detail the Shari'ah laws of performing Qadhaa Salaats.%0D%0AYour advice in fulfilling the Qadhaa Salaats will be appreciated.%0D%0AA: Qadhaa is made only for Fardh and Witr Salaats.%0D%0AIn calculation, there will be six (6) Salaats per day, one hundred and%0D%0Aeighty (180) Salaats per month, two thousand, one hundred and sixty (2160)%0D%0ASalaats per year. Calculate the number of missed Salaats from the time of%0D%0ABuloogh (maturity). If one is unable to calculate the actual number of%0D%0Amissed Salaats, due to not having any records, then he%2Fshe should apply%0D%0Ahis%2Fher honest discretion in calculating the missed Salaats.%0D%0AIt is not permissible to give Fidyah (monetary compensation) for the missed%0D%0ASalaats if one is able to fulfil the Qadhaa Salaats. The Fidya for each%0D%0Amissed Salaat is the same as Sadaqatul Fitr (approx. R7.00). The approximate%0D%0Aamount for the missed Salaats for one year will be (approx. R15,000). A%0D%0Abequest should be made during one's lifetime to pay the Fidya for the%0D%0Aunfulfilled Qadhaa Salaats from one third of one's estate after fulfillment%0D%0Aof debts.%0D%0AThank Allah Ta'ala for giving you the concern to fulfil the missed Salaats.%0D%0AHow will one face Allah Ta'ala on the day of Qiyaamat should he%2Fshe pass%0D%0Aaway without fulfilling the Qadhaa Salaats? An easy method to fulfil the%0D%0AQadhaa Salaats is, after each daily Fardh Salaat, for example, after Dhuhr%0D%0ASalaat of today, perform one Dhuhr Qadhaa Salaat."
