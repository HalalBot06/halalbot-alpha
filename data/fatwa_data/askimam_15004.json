  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissible to keep snakes as pets?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is reprehensible to keep snakes as pets as these creatures have a despicable status in the Shariâ€™ah as well as people have a natural disliking for them. Furthermore, these are creatures that will be used to punish people in the graves.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
