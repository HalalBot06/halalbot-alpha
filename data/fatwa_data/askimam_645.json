  "question": "Please advise if it is acceptable to approach a conventional bank to effect an asset based transaction where the interest rate and the period of re-payment is fixed?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the conventional bank offers a loan on interest, it is not permissible\neven if the interest rate is fixed. The Qur'aan expressly prohibits every\nform of interest.\n\nHowever, if the bank proposes to purchase the asset and resell it to the\nclient on a fixed profit, then it will be permissible. The addition on the\npurchase amount will be a profit on sales and not interest.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
