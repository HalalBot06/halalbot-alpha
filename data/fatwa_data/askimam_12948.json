  "question": "If Christian girl who I intend to marry should still attend church",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSallam . Theres this Christian girl , who I intend to marry on condition that she embrases Islam . She seems quite willing. The problem is that she attends some Rhema church with her sister who is in bible school - this really bothers me , as she claims she enjoys this church . Somehow I feel threatened that her sister as well as this church could somehow influence her choice in embrasing Islam ! I somehow need to handle this with Tactic ! Can you suggest anything !\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, it is permissible for you to marry a christian female. It appears that you understand the implications of marrying a christian. Why don't you refer her to IPCI in Queen St., Durban or alternatively arrange for her doubts on Islam to be answered.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
