  "question": "Can i say 'i love you' to my future spouse? We are going to get engaged this year.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible to have any premarital contact with one?s future spouse. That includes any form of expression of love. We also wish to point out that the concept of engagement has no basis in Shari?ah.\n\nIn Islam, marriage is a simple matter without much expenses. We advise you bring up the courage and discuss this with responsible persons and articulate the Sunnah method of marriage. That will invoke the blessings of Allah as opposed to incurring the wrath of Allah in indulging in anything un-Islamic.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
