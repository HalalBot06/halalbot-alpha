  "question": "Platinum is more rare/precious than gold. Discovered recently (+400 yrs). Why no Zakaat? Plat. Jewellery is more expensive than gold.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlatinum if it had been discovered in the time of the prophet (saws) would have been used like gold, maybe more so because its characteristics. Like intoxicants are forbidden,of \"dates and grapes\", but also of potatoes(vodka) or rice (sushi), since the latter was \"discovered\" later.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the time of Rasulullah (SAW), there were other natural valuables besides\ngold and silver as platinum is available today. But only gold and silver\nhave been mentioned independently as zakaatable. However, the Fuqaha have\ndiscussed the illat (underlying reasons) of the six zakaatable items\nmentioned in the Hadith. If those reasons with the conditions of zakaat\nbeing compulsory are found in platinum, then only will platinum be\nzakaatable.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
