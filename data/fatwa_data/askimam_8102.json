Was there an elaborate function contrary to what our Beloved Nabi (Salallahu Alayhi Wasalam) guided us on? Or reflect on our past and present, have we lived our lives to what Nabi (Salallahu Ayahil Wasalam) taught, or are we following the Eastern and Western customs?%0D%0A%0D%0AThe first step to seek release from problems and difficulties is to sincerely repent on all sins from the time we became of age till now- with regret and remorse and seeking Allah's help to change our lives to His Ta'ala's obedience. (N.B. Nabi (Salallahu Alayhi Wasalam) being Ma?soom repented 100 times a day - so what about us sinful people?)
