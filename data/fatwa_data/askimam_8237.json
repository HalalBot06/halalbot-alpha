  "question": "I have the Qur'an and books on Islam placed in a certain room of our house. In SAME room, we also keep clothes...Is it disrespectful?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have the Holy Qur'an and books on Islam placed in a certain room (a fairly large room) of our house. In the SAME room, we also keep clothes, inorder for them to undergo a drying process, after having been washed. I am worried that this might be disrespecful to the Qur'an and the books on Islam. Is it disrespectful? The clothes are kept for drying, in this room, because it is convenient to do so. It would prove rather difficult to place the clothes for drying, in any other room of the house (we live in a flat). I'm worried that i might be causing disrespect to the Qur'an.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not disrespectful to keep the Qur?aan in such a room.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
