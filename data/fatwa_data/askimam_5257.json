  "question": "What is Kashf/Ilhaam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAre there any ahadeeth or riwayaats pertaining to kashf/ilhaam? Also, Sufism was developed after Rasulullah (sallallahu Alyhi Wasallam) How and why did it develop to as it is now? what is the need for it? and why isn't it considered a bid'ah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Kashf literally means exposure. In the technical sense, it refers to the%0D%0Aexposure of certain non-visible things to certain people. Ilhaam is a%0D%0Areference to knowledge that appears in the heart and it inspires a person to%0D%0Aact accordingly without any further proof. There are Ahaadith to the effect%0D%0Athat some Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) experienced such things. The holy Qur%0D%0A'aan states, 'Wa awhaynaa ilaa ummi moosaa.' The Mufassireen have%0D%0Ainterpreted this to mean that Allah Ta'ala had sent Ilhaam onto the heart of%0D%0AMoosa (Alayhis salaam)'s mother.%0D%0A2. Sufism like so many other branches of Deen were formally developed only%0D%0Aafter Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). For instance, the%0D%0Apresent-day Darul Ulooms were not found in this form during the time of%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), but they are not regarded as Bid'%0D%0Aat. The same applies to Sufism. Tasawwuf is also a branch of Deen because it%0D%0Aentails cleansing of the heart of spiritual ailments. However, we must%0D%0Aconcede that over the years, certain un-Islamic practices have seeped into%0D%0Athis branch of Deen. They would obviously remain un-Islamic. As far as the%0D%0Ateachings and objectives of Tasawwuf are concerned, they are established%0D%0Afrom the Qur'aan and Hadith.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Kadwa%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
