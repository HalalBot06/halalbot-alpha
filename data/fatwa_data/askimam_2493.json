  "question": "If a non-Muslim becomes Muslim just to keep his Muslim family together, is it ok to accept him as husband?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy husband became muslim 9 years ago, went for umrah too. We have a 4 years-old boy. Now he decided to go back to Judaism. I started the procedur to legally divorce him, and settle the child custody problem. He wants to become Muslim again to keep his family togather. He said, He can't be a Muttawa, but wants to try to consider accepting Islam to keep his family togather. Now I don't know what to do. Please help me. Thanks\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe advise you resort to Istikhaara (seek divine guidance). See Istikhaara at\nwww.alinaam.org.za/library/istikhaara.html\n\nYour intention during Istikhaara should be of reconciling. Furthermore, why\ndid your husband go back to Judaism? Does he have any doubts about Islam?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
