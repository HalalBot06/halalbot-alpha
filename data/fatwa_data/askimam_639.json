  "question": "In Islam we have to wash after passing urine. My friend has a problem of urine dripping in drops even after a few minutes after passing urine.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy friend has a problem of urine dripping in drops everytime he goes for urination. In this case has he to take bath everytime before he prays or has he to change the dress. At times he feels that urine is coming in drops while he is in salat.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour friend falls under in the category of ?Ma?zoor? (excused) person. After performing Wudhu and while performing Salaat, the dropping of urine does not invalidate the Salaat or Wudhu.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
