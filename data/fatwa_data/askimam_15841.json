  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nApart from the norms and traditions, is there any shariah ruling regarding a wife' s calling her husband with his name\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is compulsory upon the wife to respect her husband. If calling her husband by his name is regarded as disrespectful by him or in that family or community, then it will be prohibited for her to call her husband by his name.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
