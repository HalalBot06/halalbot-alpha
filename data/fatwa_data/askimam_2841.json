  "question": "Swearing (bad words)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) How bad a sin is it to swear (as in say bad words)? How do I approch a brother who swears a lot? 2) If one accidentally breaks a statue that doesn't belong to them does it count as a good deed?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two aspects here:\nOne is I'elaam (to inform) and the other is I'emaal (to make others\npractice). Informing is merely a means of making others practice. The\npurpose (to make others practice) should be placed first and then wisdom\nshould be applied in trying to achieve the purpose.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
