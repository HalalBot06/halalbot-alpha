  "question": "kazaa salaat-1)It is NOW that I have come to know of the Hadis about Salaat becoming invalid if oneâ€™s pants hang below the ankles.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsslamualaikum... I am 18 years old, and attained puberty when I was 13. But I started praying regularly when I was 15. As I understand I have to perform kazaa salaat for the 2 years I didn?t pray. Please confirm that. Secondly It is NOW that I have come to know of the Hadis about Salaat becoming invalid if one?s pants hang below the ankles. Ofcourse now I have started keeping it above my ankles. But for the 3 years I HAVE prayed regularly, I did not care about the pants. So If I have to perform kazaa Salaat for the period of 2 years after puberty that I did not pray AT ALL... do I have to perform kazaa salaat for the 3 years that I have been praying with my pants hanging below my ankles??\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The Salaat performed with the pants below the ankles is valid. Where the\nHadith mentions its invalidity, the Hadith is interpreted as a warning for\nlowering the pants below the ankles. Hence, Salaat performed with the pants\nbelow the ankles need not be repeated.\n2. Your Qadhaa will only apply for the Salaat you actually missed out. Two\nyears only in your case.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
