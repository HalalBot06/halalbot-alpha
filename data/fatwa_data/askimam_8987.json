  "question": "What is the doa after a person was being fitnah by the boss. It involves $100 thousands of dollars and I was being made a scapegoat. I was told to resign.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe deeply sympathise with you and make Du?aa that Allah Ta?ala protect you from the evils of evil doers, Aameen.\n\nYou should adopt methods that are acceptable and available to you to address your grievances. If you cannot do that, adopt Sabr and turn your gaze to Allah and make Du?aa. Also, recite ?Yaa Hafizu? as much as possible.\n\nIn such situations, a Mu?min takes refuge and consolement from the belief of life after death when justice will be meted out in the court of Allah Ta?ala.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
