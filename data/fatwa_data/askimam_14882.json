May Allah grant you strength and courage to overcome your difficulty, Ameen.\n\nWe advise you seek the assistance of an Aalim who is also known by your husband and is respected by your husband. The Aalim could express your feelings to your husband and encourage him to reconcile. You should also recite the following dua after fardh salah.\n\n\nبسم الله الذى لا اله هو الرحمن الرحيم الهم اذهب عنى الهم والحزن\n\nBismillahilazi La Ilaaha Illa Huwar Rahmaanur Raheem, Allahum-azhib anni Allahumma walhuzn\n\n\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa, Madrassah In'aamiyyah"
