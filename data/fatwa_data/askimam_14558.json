  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan you answer the following question:\n\nI have heard that a woman, who's milk supply drops or dries out completely, is a woman who has sinned alot. Is this true? Can this statement be substantiated with an Ahaadith.\n\nThis is a woman whose milk supply has depleted after 7 months of breastfeeding.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe have not come across any authentic Hadith to this effect. The statement seems far fetched. It is possible that the milk may dry up for medical reasons. It is not appropriate to judge others actions in this way. Allah is the judge. We must focus on ourselves and try to earn the pleasure of Allah and gain salvation in the hereafter.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
