Her parents dont even want to meet me. and what should I be doign now. jazakumullah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is very pleasing to note that you would like to get married in an Islamic\nway. May Allah Ta'ala keep you steadfast on this intention, Aameen.\n\nIt is permissible to see the face of a prospective spouse, under guidance.\nThe matter of the girl's parents wherein they say that there is many\nnegative factors between you and your prospective spouse may be factors\nwhich may hinder you in the future. If the girl is really interested in\nmarriage, then she should exercise patience and make Du'aa that Allah Ta'ala\nopen up her path for marriage. Being a student and being married is very\nstressful. There would be a lack of concentration, division of time between\nstudies and spouse. Concentrate on your studies and take full benefit of\nyour studies.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
