  "question": "1. Is it permissible to join someone in salaat who himself was late for the jam'aah? 2. Can someone following the Hanafi math-hab lead 'Asr salaat during the time of first shadow?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nOften I see people in my university joining someone who is making up some rak'aats after being late for Jamaat (making the late-comer the imam). Kindly give the position of the four Imams regarding this issue.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The person who joins the Jamaa` late is termed as Masbooq. It is stated\nin Shaami, 'It is not permissible to follow the Masbooq.' (Vol.1 pg.597;\nShaami). This is the ruling according to the Hanafi Madhab. Regarding the\nother Imaams, due to our recent relocation, we do not have access to\nreference works of the other Madhaahib. Therefore, we are unable to furnish\nany information regarding their rulings at present.\n2. There are differences of opinion among the Hanafi Fuqahaa regarding the\nterminating time of Dhuhr and commencing time of Asr. Imaam Abu Yusuf and\nImaam Muhammad (two leading students of Imaam Abu Hanifa) hold the same view\nas Shaaf'ee. Many jurists have preferred this view, therefore, the Salaat\nduring Shaaf'ee Asr time will be valid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
