  "question": "What is ruling about smoking and alcoholic perfumes? Are these mubah, permissible or haraam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is ruling about smoking and alcoholic perfumes? Are these mubah, permissible or haraam?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Smoking is prohibited as it is injurious to health. The Ulama differ in the degree of prohibition. Some rule it is Haraam and others rule it is Makrooh. Both, Haraam and Makrooh, are academic terms with a specific definition but both are common in the ruling of prohibition.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Q: Is it permissible to use a perfume, deodorant, etc. which contains alcohol, and if so, can one perform Salaat without washing it off?%0D%0AA: It is not permissible to use deodorants that contain alcohol from grapes or date extracts. Such perfumes are impure and Salaat with it is invalid. However, if the alcohol is synthetic, it is pure and permissible to use. Salaat without washing off such perfumes will be valid. Sometimes, it becomes difficult to differentiate between genuine and synthetic alcohol. Thus, to be on the safe side, one should rather prefer using deodorants and perfumes that are labelled as ?alcohol-free?, especially when such perfumes are easily available.
