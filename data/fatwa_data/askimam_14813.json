  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nHi, a very good friend and collegae of mine, is face with a difficult situation.  As a diplomat he would be expected to serve alcohol as part of entertaining and meeting with other diplomats, foreign guests, officials of respective country of embassy, ambassadors etc. at his diplomatic home.  As a muslim, I understand, he is not allow to serve or have liquor in his home.  His director expects them to serve alchohol, but he feels it is wrong, and is scared that when the time comes and he is requested to do so, he will have to refuse the request. Is he correct in refusing to serve alchohol, or is there a fatwa, that permits the serving of alchohol, when it comes to diplomatic or work related entertainment.  Forgive me, if am unsure about muslim ways, I grew up an christian and has recently become very interested in learning more about the muslim ways, and thus trying to help  my friend. \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n Thank you for your e-mail and concern for your muslim friend and collegue. Your interest in Islam is encouraging.\n All types of intoxicants are prohibited in Islam. This includes drinking as well as serving. There is no relaxation on their prohibition due to diplomatic reasons.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
