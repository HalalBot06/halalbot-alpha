  "question": "You say that Sufis are in the AhlusSunnah wal Jamaat, check out www.theabode.net and www.ias.org/departments/sufimusic and www.universalsufism.com are these the beliefs of AhlusSunnah Wal Jamaat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nYou say that it is the fardz duty of those in Muslim countries to fight the USA in jihad in Iraq, what is the duty of Muslims that are in the USA? The deviant kaafirs the Qadianis and the AAIIL are spreading lies about Islam and claiming a false prophet has any reliable ulama issued a fatwa for jihad against them, if no then is jihad valid against them? You also say that Sufis are in the AhlusSunnah wal Jamaat, check out www.theabode.net and www.ias.org/departments/sufimusic and www.universalsufism.com are these the beliefs of AhlusSunnah Wal Jamaat? To me (an unlearned person) these things look like bidah, how are these things in the Sunnah of Nabi Karim SAW? I didn?t even see them encourage salah or giving prayer times on these sites. At these places they go there are not even masjids! How is this Islam when it looks like it is haraam and/or bidah and/or shirk and/or kufr?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe choose not to issue a verdict of physical Jihaad against the Qadiyanis, etc.\n\nAs for the Sufis being part of the Ahlus sunnah, it should be noted that it is not our claim that all Sufis are part of the Ahlus sunnah and neither do we exclude all Sufis from Ahlus sunnah. Those that are truly practising upon the Shari?ah and are not violating any divine injunction cannot be excluded just on the basis of being called Sufis.\n\nHence, each of the various types of Sufis will have to be viewed in the light of the Shari?ah. No general ruling can be made concerning the status of all of them at once.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
