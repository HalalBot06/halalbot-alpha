  "question": "Is this act an act of kufr?..What if this person asks his mother to pray in the other room (because he is watching TV)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nQ1: What if a person's mother comes into a room where the person is watching TV so that she (the mother) may pray. What if this person asks his mother to pray in the other room (because he is watching TV) and she (the mother) agrees to what the son is saying and she prays in the other room......did the son commit an act of kufr? I mean, is what the son did considered an act of kufr (disbelief)? Q2: What if a person does something and he isn't sure if that act is an act of kufr or not....and so he goes and asks a scholar about so and so act he committed/did.....does the person automatically commit disbelief (kufr) simply because he thought he may have committed kufr and so wanted to check with a scholar....I hope you get what I'm trying to ask.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe request to the mother to perform Salaat is another room is not kufr.\n\nThe fear of Kufr and the desire to enquire about it is due to one being sensitive to Imaan. That too is not kufr.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
