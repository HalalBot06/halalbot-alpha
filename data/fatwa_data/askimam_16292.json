  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question is reference to the Hazrat Muhamamd (P.B.U.H) introduction given on the site\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad\n\nOn this site they have given a picture in which Hazrat Muhamamd (P.B.U.H) image is shown, and on a blog a petition is asked from muslims to sign if they want to remove these pictures\n\nhttp://www.thepetitionsite.com/2/removal-of-the-pics-of-muhammad-from-wikipedia\n\nMy question\n\n1. This picture given on the above link is not a cartoon but simply an image which if for example is not also insulting but simply to illustrate the old age. Still it is wrong and we have to sign the petition.\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is still wrong to have an image of Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم), irrespective on the reason behind it. The petition to remove the image should be signed by as many people as possible. The few minutes spent in that will be in the cause of protecting the Azmat and greatness of Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم). And a means of the pleasure of Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and this could be a means of our salvation in the hereafter, Aameen.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
