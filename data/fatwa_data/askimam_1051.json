  "question": "Could you be more definite in your fatwas so that your manhaj and beliefs are crystal clear to the reader?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nYou seem to avoid many specifics in your answers to questions such as is Sufism right or wrong or what did scholars say about Ibn Taymiyyah and what about going out with Jamatul-Tableegh. Perhaps you are trying to be tactful or avoid controversy but when giving fataawa your concern should bethe truth and upholding the responsibility of guiding those who ask you and those who read your words.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0AJazaakumullah for your advise. Hereunder are our beliefs on:%0D%0A%0D%0ASufism%0D%0ASufism is a process of spiritual upliftment. It is a way of reforming%0D%0Aoneself and attaining closeness to Allah Ta'ala. Spiritual upliftment,%0D%0Areformation and attaining closeness to Allah are orders replete in the%0D%0AQur'aan.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf it is possible for any individual to reform himself, he should do so.%0D%0AHowever, it is generally noticed that individuals experience difficulties in%0D%0Areforming themselves and seek assistance of a spiritual guide who is pious%0D%0Aand adhere to Shari'ah in reforming themselves. The practise of taking%0D%0Aallegiance (Bay'at) and following the guidance of one's spiritual mentor is%0D%0Acalled Sufism.%0D%0A%0D%0AIbn Taymiya%0D%0AShaykh Taqi-u-ddin Ahmad ibn Taymiyah was a prominent Aalim (scholar) of%0D%0ADeen. Shaykh Taqi-u-ddin had his independent views on many matters based on%0D%0Ahis vast knowledge and research. It is incorrect for non-scholars and%0D%0Anon-academics to pass a judgment especially on such learned people. They%0D%0Ashould fear Allah and abstain from engaging themselves in such discussions.%0D%0ADifferences of opinion is a salient feature among the Ulama-e-Haqq (true%0D%0Ascholars).%0D%0A%0D%0ATabligh%0D%0AAllah Ta%E3la states that one reason for this Ummah being titled as the best%0D%0Aof Ummah, is the practice of commanding good and preventing evil'.%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) states, 'Whosoever from among you%0D%0Awitnesses evil, he should change it with his hands. And if he is unable to%0D%0Ado so then he should change it with his tongue. And if he is unable to do so%0D%0Awith his tongue, then he should at least consider it to be wrong. And this%0D%0Ais the weakest stage of Imaan. (Mishk%E3t)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Nu%FAmaan bin Basheer (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) says that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) gave an example of people sailing on a boat%0D%0Ahaving an upper deck and a lower deck. The people from the lower deck%0D%0Arequire water and request water from the people of the upper deck. The%0D%0Apeople from the upper deck refuse water so the people from the lower deck%0D%0Adecide to make a hole on the floor of the ship and get water from the sea.%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'If the people from the upper%0D%0Adeck don't stop the people at the bottom from making a hole, the ship will%0D%0Asink and all the people travelling will drown. (Mishk%E3t vol. 2 p. 436)%0D%0A%0D%0ASimilarly, if people do not prohibit evil and sin in the society, the entire%0D%0Asociety - innocent and evil - will equally suffer.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) states that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'Command good and prohibit evil or else Allah will%0D%0Asend such a punishment that will destroy everyone'. (Ibid).%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above quotations of the Qur%E3n and Ahaadith of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam) are clear that commanding good and prohibiting evil is an%0D%0Aemphasised injunction of Allah and His Rasul. Every person must carry out%0D%0Athis injunction. All the Prophets (%C1layhimus salaam) followed the footsteps%0D%0Aof their respective Prophets and after the demise of their Prophet, they%0D%0Acarried out the same mission. The Sahaaba of Rasulullah (Radhiallaahu %C1nhum)%0D%0Aspent their entire lives in commanding good and prohibiting evil. Since%0D%0Athere is no Prophet to come, every Ummati of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam) is the deputy of the Prophet and he has to carry on the mission of%0D%0Athe Prophet. The people of Tabligh Jamaat sacrifice their time, wealth and%0D%0Acomforts to undergo difficulty and hardships to go in the path of Allah - to%0D%0Acarry out this Sunnah of the Prophets - commanding good and prohibiting%0D%0Aevil.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs far as the Tabligh Jamaat is concerned, it is our humble view that they%0D%0Aare acting upon this injunction of Allah Ta%E3la and are fulfilling this%0D%0Aobligation of Shari%E1h. the Jamaat advocates strict adherence to the Sunnah%0D%0Aand confirnes itself within the ambit of the Shari%E1h. The purpose of any%0D%0Aindividual taking part in the Noble work of Tabligh is firstly to reform%0D%0Aoneself and dutifully save mankind from the fire of hell. The overwhelming%0D%0Asuccess of the Jamaat is mainly because of the manifestation of the six%0D%0Apoints which involves the purification of the Naffs and the entity of%0D%0ATawheed.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe word, 'Tashkeel', literally means to form. In the terminology of%0D%0ATabligh, it means to urge the people to give time, to come out in the path%0D%0Aof Allah for self reformation and propagating good for a number of days 3,%0D%0A7, 40, 4 months, 1 year, etc. The number of days is also not compulsory, it%0D%0Ais only recommended just as it is recommended that a person studying first%0D%0Aaid, for example, serves one month as practicals. While he will not be an%0D%0Aexpert in medicine, he will know the basic things to do during an emergency.%0D%0ASimilarly, a person going out for 3 days, 40 days, 4 months, etc. does not%0D%0Abecome an expert on Shari%E1h, but he will learn the basic requirements of%0D%0AShari%E1h. The more time he gives, the more he will learn and perfect himself.%0D%0AThe time frame is not a criteria according to Shari%E1h.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
