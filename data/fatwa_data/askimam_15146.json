  "question": "Salaah behind the Imam for a woman",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWe are living in Saudi Arabia, and followers of Hanafi Madhab. When we are traveling to other cities or even in the same city, we have to pray Namaaz in road side Masjid, should women pray behind the Imaam or they should pray separately?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAlthough her Salaah will be valid behind the Imam provided the Imam makes intention for her, it is preferable for her not to join the Jamaat and perform Salaah on her own.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nDarul Iftaa"
