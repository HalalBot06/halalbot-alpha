  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI was wondering if it is haram for girls to rap? Its just speaking with a rhythm I guess.\nMost girls dont sound beautiful rapping, and I sure dont . Rapping is also not beautifying the voice.\nSo is it haram for girls to rap or not?\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nWe are living in a society that is desperate to rid us of our Deeni values and ethos. In the recent past invented many new concepts and ideas have been invented that are perceived to have an Islamic flavour. Ignorant and gullible Muslims consider it to be part of Deen and blindly become addicted to the plot of the Shaytaan.\n\nRasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said “Shaytaan said I destroyed man by involving them in sin and they destroyed me with Istighfaar (seeking Allah’s pardon). Thereafter I decorated the sin and made them consider that to be good so that they do not repent to Allah”.\n\nMusic in whatever form, Rap, Pop, Rock etc. is completely Haraam. It is unfortunate that nowadays some Muslim “singers” have introduced this Haraam Rap with Islamic content. This is exactly the agenda of Shaytaan. Many people consider the content to be Islamic, and regard listening to the rap to be an act of virtue without realizing the Haraam they are involved in.\n\nMuslims are therefore advised to abstain from listing to all forms of music including those that are disguised with an Islamic content.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
