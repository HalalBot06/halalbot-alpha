  "question": "Is Data manipulation using logic Halal",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs Data manipulation using logic Halal\n\nI work in a traffic engineeering consulting company. Here we collect trafficdata. Sometimes we could not collect complete data due to mechanical failure in instruments. But however we can make missing data (sometimes more than 50%) using logic, however the data can not be reliable as it is not original. is it halal to do this manipulation? Jazakallah Khair\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nPenalty, if inflicted, should be parallel to the crime committed. If data manipulation is done and can cause harm to others by way of a fine etc. then it will not be correct to do this. If data is collected as mere statistics, for record purposes without the intention of causing any harm, then data manipulation will be correct.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf\nDARUL IFTA – JAMEAH MAHMOODIYAH, SPRINGS\n\nJOINT PROJECT WITH DARUL IFTA, MADRASAH IN’AAMIYYAH, CAMPERDOWN"
