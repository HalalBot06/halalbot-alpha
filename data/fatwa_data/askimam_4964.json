  "answer": "QUESTION\nEvery year before Valentine?s day - February 14 - the media kindles our emotions to express love to our dear ones. As a wife, my husband expects me to present him a gift on that day.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nValentines day has its roots in the Christian religion. It was established to mourn the death of a Roman priest, St. Valentine of the third Century AD. (Sunday Tribune 6/2/2000) \n\n\nSince Valentines day was initially associated with Christianity, the expression of love in the form of exchanging Valentines gifts on that day will not be permissible. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, Whosoever imitates a nation, is amongst them.(Abu Dawud pg.559; HM Saeed)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n \nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\n\n\n\n(14/02/02)"
