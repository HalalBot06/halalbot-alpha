  "question": "Why is Chain Haram if it is not imitating women?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualikum. In my last question (11075: regarding the wearing of chains for men) you did not give me any hard evidence that the wearing of chain is prohibited. You merely stated that imitating women is prohibited, which is obvious. But some chains (in today?s age) are specified only for men, and chains in general are usually used for men whereas for women they are called necklace. Mufti Sahib, after explaining this could you please explain why chains would be Haram, if the norm is to wear chains for men (not to imitate women) and the intention is not to imitate the kuffar or women. Jazakallahu Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt must be understood that even if your intention is not to imitate the Kuffaar or women, then too the wearing of chains for men is not permissible. Chains is used for beautification which is advised for women, not men.\n\nYes, ?beautification? for men (to dress appropriately and to be presentable, etc.) is completely permissible, and in fact encouraged.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
