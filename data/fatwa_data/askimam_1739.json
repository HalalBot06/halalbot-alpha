  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualikum! Some Ulema from India and Pakistan say that we should not call prophet Muhammad (PBUH) human being, because He (PBUH) was Noor of Allah(SWT). While in many verses of the Qur'an it is clearly stated that He (PBUH) was a human being. The interpretation of such verses by these Ulema is very confusing. Would you please explain: 1)What is the shara'i ruling in this regard? 2)One should study or avoid the tafaseer/translations of those Ulema's? Please also suggest some good tafaseers in Urdu and English. Jazak Allah Khairan.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs salaamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu\n\nDear respected brother/sister in Islam,\n\nRasulullah (Sallallahu-Alaihiwasallam) was certainly a human being as also mentioned in the Quran and Ahadith. Allah Ta'ala also refers to him as Noor (light) as his teachings were means of guidance and light for people. The explanation of Rasulullah being Noor and not a human being is incorrect.\n\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
