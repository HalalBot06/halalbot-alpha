  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalaamu-Alaikum\n\nI have heard that it is wrong for a muslim woman to dye her hair black.Is this true and why is it wrong to do so?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nPure black dye is not permissible. Rasulullah صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"There will be people who will come later (in my Ummah) and apply black dye. They will not even smell the fragrance of paradise.\" (Abu Daawood).\n\nTo dye the hair any other colour besides black e.g. Mehndi or Katm (type of grass) is permissible. This was the practice of Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and the Sahaaba (Radhiyallaahu Ánhum). (Jawahirul Fiqh vol2 pg421)\n\n\n\nAl-Mahmood Vol.1 pg.22\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
