  "question": "Is it ok for me not to wear Hijab because my non Muslim parents tell me not to until I leave their house? They don't mind that I'm muslim and I can get them to understand the need of hijab.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy parents are against Islam and my being Muslim but they finally said that they don't care but they don't want me wear it because it's representing their house hold and they are not Muslim.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn the circumstances mentioned by you, you will be excused for not wearing Hijaab (face covering). However, you should fulfil the purpose of Hijaab by not intermingling and lowering your gazes in from of Ghayr-Mahaarim (people one can marry) And Allah Ta√£la Knows Best. Was salaam Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
