  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have broken up with my special other 4 months ago, and I have not been able to get over him. I am very disturbed and cannot concentrate on other activities. I have tried distracting myself with many things but it does not help and I am always thinking of him. Is there any dua that I can read to overcome this issue faster, so I can move on with my life. I have rejected all of my proposals recieved for marriage because of this.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:"
