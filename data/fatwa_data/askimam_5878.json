In principle, it is permissible for one to study for exam while out in%0D%0AJamaat. However, it is a proven fact that every deed, action and effort has%0D%0Aits benefit when its guidelines are adhered to. Our advice is that you%0D%0Ashould adhere to the Amaal (actions) prescribed by the elders of Da'wah%0D%0Aregarding the queried issue.%0D%0A2. If a person has already commenced with the Sunnat-e-Muakkadah of Dhuhr%0D%0Aand the Jamaat commences, then he should make Salaam after two Rakaats and%0D%0Ajoin the Jamaat. And if he already commenced with the third Rakaat, then it%0D%0Ais necessary to complete the full four Rakaats. (Bahishti Zewar vol.2%0D%0Apg.170)%0D%0A3. If an insect bites a person while offering Salaat, he is permitted to%0D%0Acatch it and throw it aside. It is not good to kill it while in Salaat, but%0D%0Aif it has not bitten one as yet, one should not even catch it because it is%0D%0AMakrooh it do so. (Bahishti Zewar pg.144)%0D%0A4. It is permissible (Ma'ariful Qur'aan vol.2 pg.50)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
