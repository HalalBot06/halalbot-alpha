  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ncan we eat meat slaughtered by a Shia?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn principle, it is not permissible to eat the meat of Halaal animals slaughtered by non-Muslims. The meat of Halaal animals slaughtered by Christians and Jews are excluded from this general prohibition. Allah permits the meat of Halaal animals slaughtered by Christians and Jews, that is with the condition of Zabah in Shari’ah, which includes reciting the name of Allah before slaughtering the animal. Kindly refer to ‘Zabeeha of Ahle-Kitaab’ on our site.\n\nAs regards the meat of Halaal animals slaughtered by Shi’as, that depends on their beliefs. It is well known fact that Shi’as are different from the mainstream Ahlus sunnah Wal Jamaa. The two sects have some very fundamental differences. It is authentically recorded that many Shi’a scholars do not accept the Qur’aan as is today. Literature in the regard could be provided. Shi’as also do not accept the Ahaadith of Ahlus sunnah Wal Jamaa, do deny Hadith Mutawaatir like denying any Aayat of the Qur’aan which is Kufr. They do not believe in the Khilaafat of Abu Bakr [radhiallaahu anhu] which was established through Ijmaa of the Sahaaba – to deny anything established through Ijmaa of Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhu] is also Kufr.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
