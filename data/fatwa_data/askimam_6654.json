  "answer": "QUESTION\n(1) On jummas, can the khutba, the adaan, and the salaat be started before duhr time? (2) A friend told me that if you see an ambulance going in emergency, you should make dua. Should this be done for ambulances and fire trucks going in emergency? (3) Once, a friend and I were making maghrib jammat at his house and after I said salaams, he stood up and finished another rakaat saying that I only prayed 2 or it was vice versa. What should be done in this case.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. According to the Hanafi Madhab, the Adhaan, Khutbah and Salaat on Friday\ncannot be observed before the actual Dhuhr time. Dhuhr time starts after\nZawaal.\n2. An ambulance or any other emergency vehicle is normally an indication of\nsome calamity that has befallen someone. You may make Du'aa to Allah to\nremove the calamity from the afflicted person. Also, you may praise Allah Ta\n'ala from protecting you whilst afflicting another.\n3. If you, as the Imaam, are sure that you performed your Salaat in full,\nthere is nothing to worry about and your Salaat is considered as performed.\nIf the Muqtadee (one following) is in doubt, he should re-perform his Salaat\nand not just add on as was done in this case. If you, being the Imaam, is\nunsure of the number of Rakaats and you are thrown into doubt, all of you\nshould repeat the Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPRO"
