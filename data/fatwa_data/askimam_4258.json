  "question": "When reading Quran, should sajda tilaawat be recited immediately after the respective aayah or can one wait until the Quran is complete?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease explain why it's performed, how it should be perfomed and whether listening to an aayah on radio (for eg. Sura Iqra) also necessitates the performance of sajda tilaawat.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is advisable to perform sajda-e-tilawat immediately after reciting the\nrespective verse of sajdah. There are three reasons for making\nsajda-e-tilaawat.\nIn some verses, Allah orders us to make sajda, hence making sajda is in\nfulfilment of that order.\nAllah praises His obedient slaves who prostrate according to His command,\nmaking sajda is to imitate such obedient slaves.\nAllah condemns the disobedient slaves who refused to prostrate according to\nAllah's order, making sajda is an expression of resentment for the\ndisobedient.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
