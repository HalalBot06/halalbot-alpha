  "answer": "QUESTION\nRecently i read in the book my maulana ashraf ali thanvi that from the hadith it is clear that istekhara can be done by various methods. i would be grateful if you could also tell me the instances/occassions when the other methods of istekhara were used. Also i would be nice if you could tell me wheter any particular method is prefered(if any) in Hanfi or others. Apart from this, i would like to inform you that recently when i was viewing your marriage section i found that at a place you had recommended that unless you have the dream of your particular question for which you are doing istekhara only then it is true. Howcome this? Everywhere i have seen you critisize the dream method saying that dreams are shown by the devil. please clarify this issue and please also answer the question above.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Istikhaara basically means ?seeking Allah?s guidance? on any matter. This only applies to non-obligatory issues or when undecided between various option. One may undertake Istikhaara for marriage, business, etc.\n\nThe method of Istikhaara is as follows: perform two Rakaat Nafl Salaat before retiring to bed. Thereafter, make Du?aa begging for Allah?s guidance. The next morning, follow the inclination of the heart. If you do see a dream, the dream is indicative of the decision you should take although it is not binding.\n\n2. All dreams are not from Shaytaan, some dreams are from Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
