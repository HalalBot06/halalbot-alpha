  "answer": "QUESTION\n2. can the knees be above the Quran level? jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOne should sit in a respectful manner on the ground. It is best to place the\nQur'aan on a low table. If this is not available, hold the Qur'aan in one's\nhands. It is against etiquette to place it on one's lap.\n\nIf the Qur'aan is on a low table, then there is no harm if the knees are\nslightly higher than the Qur'aan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
