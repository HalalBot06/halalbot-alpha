  "question": "I was wondering if brushing with miswaak allowed (which has a taste to it), why isnt brushing with tooth paste allowed?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nJazakallah khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible to make miswak while fasting. To use tooth paste in the\nstate of fasting is Makrooh (disliked). The minimum taste in the miswak is\ninlike the strong taste in the paste. Furthermore the paste is a solid\nsubstance and liquidifies more in the mouth thereby having the potential of\ngoing down the throat.\n\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
