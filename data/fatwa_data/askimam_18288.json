the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIndeed, it is sad to know of the unfortunate events that have taken place in your life, including the despicable actions of your father.  There is no denying that you have been through difficult times and made some mistakes in the process.\n\nDespite the disgraceful actions of your father, you need to find it in your heart to forgive him.  Imām Bukhārī narrates,\n\nحدثنا حجاج قال حدثنا حماد هو بن سلمة عن سليمان التيمي عن سعيد القيسي عن بن عباس قال : ما من مسلم له والدان مسلمان يصبح إليهما محتسبا إلا فتح له الله بابين يعنى من الجنة وإن كان واحد فواحد وإن اغضب أحدهما لم يرض الله عنه حتى يرضى عنه قيل وإن ظلماه قال وإن ظلماه\n\n(الأدب المفرد، باب بر والديه وإن ظلما: ص 16؛ البشائر)\n\nNo Muslim who has both parents treats them well hoping for reward from Allāh except that Allāh opens two doors for him, meaning from Paradise.  And if only one is alive, then one door.  And if any one of them is upset with him, then Allāh will not be pleased with him until his parent is pleased with him.  It was asked, “Even if they oppress him?”  Ibn Abbās replied, “Even if they oppress him” (al-Adab al-Mufrad)\n\nAlthough it might be difficult for you to forgive him, you should realize that you are doing it for the pleasure of Allāh Ta’ālā.  Allāh Ta’ālā says,\n\nوَلْيَعْفُوا وَلْيَصْفَحُوا أَلَا تُحِبُّونَ أَنْ يَغْفِرَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ (النور: 22)\n\nAnd forgive and pardon.  Do you not like that Allāh forgives you?  And Allāh is the Most-Forgiving, Most-Merciful (Qur’ān 24:22)\n\nSimilarly, if you feel that your mother has wronged you in anyway, then you should forgive her.  Even if you feel your mother is being mean and she uses abusive language towards you, it is not permissible for you to yell at or mistreat her.  If your mother breaks the commands of Allāh Ta’ālā, it does not mean you should do so, as well.  Allāh Ta’ālā clearly states,\n\nوَقَضَى رَبُّكَ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوا إِلَّا إِيَّاهُ وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا إِمَّا يَبْلُغَنَّ عِنْدَكَ الْكِبَرَ أَحَدُهُمَا أَوْ كِلَاهُمَا فَلَا تَقُلْ لَهُمَا أُفٍّ وَلَا تَنْهَرْهُمَا وَقُلْ لَهُمَا قَوْلًا كَرِيمًا (الإسراء: 23)\n\nAnd your Lord has decreed that you worship non but Him and that you be dutiful to your parents.  If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them, but address them in terms of honor (Qur’ān 17:23)\n\nHence, you should regularly visit your mother and treat her in the best possible manner, regardless of her treatment of you.  Eventually, when she sees your kind behavior towards her, her attitude towards you will start to change, inshāAllāh.\n\nFurthermore, the relationship you had with the Jewish boy was, indeed, an enormous sin.  However, it is not correct for you to think that you have no chance of entering Heaven.  In a hadīth qudsī, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said,\n\nحدثنا أبو اليمان أخبرنا شعيب حدثنا أبو الزناد عن الأعرج عن أبي هريرة أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم قال قال الله أنا عند ظن عبدي بي\n(صحيح البخاري، كتاب التوحيد، باب قول الله تعالى يريدون أن يبدلوا كلام الله: 6/2725؛ ابن كثير)\n\nAllāh said, “I will treat My servant according to how he thinks of Me” (Bukhārī)\n\nTherefore, you should always think that Allāh Ta’ālā will forgive you, especially since Allāh Ta’ālā provides comfort to His servants in the Qur’ān by saying,\n\nقُلْ يَا عِبَادِيَ الَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُوا عَلَى أَنْفُسِهِمْ لَا تَقْنَطُوا مِنْ رَحْمَةِ اللَّهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ جَمِيعًا إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ (الزمر: 53)\n\nSay, “O Slaves of Mine who have transgressed against themselves!  Do not despair from the mercy of Allāh.  Verily, Allāh forgives all sins.  Truly, he is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.  (Qur’ān 39:53)\n\nYou should have peace in your heart that Allāh Ta’ālā will forgive you.  However, it is necessary for you to completely abstain from the sin, i.e. informal relations with a non-mahram boy, as Allāh Ta’ālā also mentioned,\n\nوَالَّذِينَ إِذَا فَعَلُوا فَاحِشَةً أَوْ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ ذَكَرُوا اللَّهَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا لِذُنُوبِهِمْ وَمَنْ يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَلَمْ يُصِرُّوا عَلَى مَا فَعَلُوا وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ (آل عمران: 135)\n\nAnd those who, when they commit a shameful deed or wrong themselves, remember Allāh and seek forgiveness for their sins.  And who forgives sins except for Allāh?  And they do not persist in what they have done, while they know.  (Qur’ān 3:135)\n\nTherefore, you should sever all informal relations with this boy.  It is incorrect to consider marrying him one day, as a Muslim woman cannot marry a non-Muslim man.  Since the Jewish boy did help you in the past, as you mentioned, you should make du’ā to Allāh Ta’ālā for him that Allāh Ta’ālā guides him to Islām. \n\nYou should talk to your local imām, relatives, friends, etc. and ask them to look for a nice, religious Muslim boy for you.  InshāAllāh, when you get married to a pious Muslim, a lot of your current difficulties will get easier. \n\nUntil this happens, you should try to get closer to Allāh Ta’ālā and make plenty of du’ā to Him.  May Allāh Ta’ālā make it easy for you.  Āmīn.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
