  "question": "How should the profits be shared, one tenth of the profits from R10,000 or only half of the profits from R1000?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nZayd approaches Umar, and requests him to enter into a partnership deal on an equal profit sharing basis. Umar agrees and Zayd gives him R1000 to invest as he deems fit. Umar invested the money in his own business. The stocks in trade was R9000 before Umar?s investment and R10,000 after the investment.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe partnership is in the profits from R1000 only. Upon dissolving the partnership, the capital of R1000 must be returned to Umar and 50% profits from the R1000 capital as agreed. Umar is not entitled to one tenth of the profits from R10,000\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
