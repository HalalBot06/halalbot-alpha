  "question": "Is it permissible (halal) to lie to an army of the kuffar in order to get out of it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs salaamu 'alaykum. A brother joined the U.S. Military and alhamdulillah later became Muslim. In order for him to get out of the military before his contract is up, he may have to say a few things which go against Islam such as saying that he is against all forms of war (jihad with hands included). Is it halal for him to lie to the kuffar out of necessity to get out of their military? And to what extant can he go to in his lies to them? Jazakallahu khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala says, 'And do not assist in sin.' (Maaidah)\n\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, Help the oppressor by\nstopping him from the oppression.'\n\nIn view of the aforegoing, it is not permissible for a Muslim to serve in\nany military - Muslim or non-Muslim - that oppresses people. In today's\npolitical and military world, there is no difference between a Muslim and\nnon-Muslim military. Both are known for committing injustice and oppression.\nTherefore, if one is committed to an army, he may use any suitable means to\ncome out of that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
