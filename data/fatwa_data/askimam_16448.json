  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs this correct way to pray wajib witr to raise hand in third rakat?\n\nThree Rakah Wajib (Witr)\nIn the jalsa of second rakah after Attahyyat do not recite Durood and stand up saying Takbeer (Allah Hoo Akbar). Do not recite Sana, this time start the third rakah with Aaoozubillah and Bismillah then Soorah Fatiha followed by any Soorah. Then say Takbeer (Allah Hoo Akbar) this time do not go to Ruku instead raise your hands to your ear just like you did at the beginning or first rakah. Bring them back to under your navel just like you had them.\n\nplease help me out ,my hubby allowed me to go to umrah with my brother family but hes not allowing me to go by car he says hes ready spend for aeroplane or in bus but its expensive for my brother family since they are 4 person.if we go by car we have to pay only 200dhs where as in aeroplane 1320dhs and in bus its 630dhs so its cheap for my brother family.my hubby is telling not to go if they go by car.what to do brother?and brother says why to waste money we can see holy place and we can extend also if we go by car.i told my husband that i want to go?can i go alone to jeddah by plane and my brother can pick me up from there?i know about my hubby he won't give money for hotel he will say only one person is there so my brother can adjust that why i don't like to go in aeroplane?i can go against his wish ?please tell me brother.hes not coming to umrah he says he knows when to go so i don't want to miss this chance please help me out?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nEvery thing you have mentioned regarding the third Rak’ah of Witr Salah is correct except for the recitation of Ta’awwudh (A’oodhu billah…). You should only recite it in the beginning of the Salah and not in the third Rak’ah.\n\nوالتعوذ عند افتتاح الصلاة لا غير (الفتاوى الهندية 1:73 رشيدية)\n\nIn regards to your predicament of going for Umrah, you should consider the fact that you will not be sinful for obeying your husband and not going for Umrah against his wishes. However, you will be sinful if you go for Umrah in a manner that displeases him. Consider the following Hadith; Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم stated, “There are three people whose prayers will not surpass their ears, a runaway slave until he returns, a woman who spends the night whilst her husband is displeased with her and the Imam of a community who is displeased with him.” (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, vol. 1 pg. 83, H.M. Sa’eed)\n\nقال رسول ا لله صلى الله عليه و سلم ثلاثة لا تجاوز صلاتهم آذانهم العبد الآبق\n\n حتى يرجع وامرأة باتت وزوجها عليها ساخط وإمام قوم وهم له كارهون\n\nInstead of earning the pleasure and reward of Allah, you would be earning the displeasure of Allah due to your disobedience to your husband. Furthermore, it will not be permissible for you to travel to Jeddah by plane without a Mahram.\n\nWe understand your ardent desire to visit such a blessed place and commend you for that; however, you should not choose such a coarse of action which will cause you to be sinful as well as put a strain on your marital life. We advise you to try a diplomatic approach with your husband and try your best to persuade him to either come with you or send you with your brother with his pleasure and happiness. By doing this, you will avoid the ill-effects of disobedience and derive maximum benefit from your Umrah, insha-Allah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
