  "question": "What does the soul experience after death? Where does it stay? Can people communicate with these souls?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe soul reunites with the body and lives in a different realm or sphere of existence called ?Barzakh?.\n\nGenerally speaking, no one can communicate with the soul. There may have been rare occasions where people may have communicated with the soul of the dead, but this falls under the category of supernatural deeds. Supernatural deeds of pious people are termed Karaamat (miracles). Those of impious or irreligious persons are termed Istidraaj. It is a form of tests which Allah Ta?ala in His wisdom allows to occur. Communication cannot be acquired by any unknown means, but it can be occurred by unnatural means.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
