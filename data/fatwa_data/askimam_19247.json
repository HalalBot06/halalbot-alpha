  "question": "Blasphemy law in Pakistan",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamoAlaikum Mufti Sahib, http://www.facebook.com/augpk?sk=info http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http://aug.org.pk/&h=2fd3d I learnt of this group and what they claim just recently. I've never visited a scholar personally and asked for their opinion on the blasphemy law in Pakistan (and the entire background to the validity of it), but whenever I asked them on phone (in Pakistan) I was informed that there was no issue with it and it was absolutely correct. I totally trust what ulama (of deoband) in Pakistan have to say. But what this group is claiming I want to know if there's some truth in it? Of course, they're just random people rallying together and are not scholars, and there's no ground to even trust what they say, but still it is raising a question among people I know, so I was wondering if you could clarify and, possibly, all place it on your website if what they're saying is wrong. JazakAllah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nJazak Allah for your question.
