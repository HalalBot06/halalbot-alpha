  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamoalaikum mufti sahib,\n\nMe and my husband had problems in marriage and I said a few hurtful things to him like divorce me if u dont want me and I am going to a divorce lawyer which I never did. Do these things affect our nikah as they were said by me and not my husband?\n\nIf the wife says the word of divorce does it invalidate the nikah? Now Allah has blessed me with wisdom and patience and I have done tauba but still want to make sure. Also is name Iman suitable for a Muslim girl?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\n1.      Any statement of divorce from the wife does not constitute divorce.\n\n2.      The name Iman is suitable for a muslim girl.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best,\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
