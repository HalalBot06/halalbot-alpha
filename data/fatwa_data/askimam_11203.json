  "question": "Many people argue about the Sunnah practices, e.g.: why do Muslims then travel in cars and airplanes",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMufti sahib whenever I talk about practicing Sunnah, I am asked the question that if you have to follow the complete Sunnah e.g.: using Miswaak, uncovering ankles, covering heads, etc. then don?t even travel in the car or in the airplane to go to far off places, use a horse or a camel, as Nabi (SAW) used to travel on horse or camel, and don?t use the electricity and electrical appliances, etc. They say that these things are advancements, and similarly toothbrush and toothpaste are advancements of Miswaak, and the Sunnah clothes were only a tradition at that time, etc. Please provide with a definition of what practices are regarded as Sunnah and what things do change with time. Mufti sahib please provide a befitting reply for these types of questions. Jazakullahu khairun.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA Sunnat is defined as the practice of Prophet Muhammad [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam], Khualafae Rashideen and the Companions of the Prophet [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam].%0D%0A%0D%0ABid?ah is an innovation in the name of Deen and is a major sin as it wipes away a Sunnat and takes the place of it.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn a Hadith the Prophet [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] has mentioned that whosoever practices upon an act which we have not given the order of is rejected. (Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another Hadith the Prophet [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] has said whoever brings out a new act then he is cursed by Allah, Angels and all the people. His compulsory acts are not accepted nor his optional acts. (Mishkaat)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe question arises which acts are classified as bidats in the Sharriat?%0D%0A%0D%0AAny act of worship which in not found in the following:%0D%0A? Quran %0D%0A? Sunnat %0D%0A? At the time of our Prophet [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] and his Companions %0D%0A? Century after that (Tabeeen) %0D%0A? Century after the Tabeen (Taba Tabeen) %0D%0A? Ijama Ummat %0D%0A? Qiyaas%0D%0AIf an act is not found in the above and it is practiced upon as if it is Sharriat then this will be called Bidat.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis is why every new thing will not be called a Forbidden Bidat. Thus, those new things which are done for the Deen, meaning to make the Deen stronger etc will not be in the category of the Forbidden Bidat. For example in the Prophet?s time there were no Dar ul Uloom, where people can go and live to study the knowledge of Allah and His Prophet. However in today?s life there are many Dar ul Uloom (alhamdulillah) and therefore this is a new act. But this new act is for the strength and help of the deen, so people can learn the knowledge and act upon it. It is not an act which is made within the deen. In the same way making Madrassas and Makatibs wil! l not be a Bidat.%0D%0A%0D%0ASimilarly, in today?s life new technology, airplanes, trains, metro, electric appliance etc. will not be called Bidat, because when we use such items we do not make it a part of the Deen and Sharriat. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
