If your students are males and they are baaligh, you should observe Hijaab in front of them. If your sons is baaligh, he may be the Imaam and recite Qiraat audibly in Fajr, Maghrib and Esha Salaats.\nIf the students do not know what to recite in the different postures of Salaat, you may conduct separate practical lessons for that in which all the aspects of Qiraat, Tashahhud, etc. may be recited audibly for teaching purposes.\n\n3. The other aspects of Salaat, e.g. Tasbeeh, Tashahhud, etc. cannot be recited audibly.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
