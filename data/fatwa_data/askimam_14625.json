  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am seeking peace. My husband are two brothers only and my one and only aunt(my mother's sister ) is my sister-in-law. She has been married for 20 years but have no kids. When I got married and we too had no children, we came to know that my husband have same problem as his brother and cannot be a father in his life. It was a very sad moment for two of us.We decided not to tell anyone about it as it would give our family  a big grief.I knew that my aunt had also tried Artificial insemination through donor so I thought that this is ok to go through it. And by the grace of God, I conceived .Throughtout my pregnancy, I was doing ok and did not think about it as if it is JAIZ in Islam or not.Once in a Canadian TV program an imam came to answer few Qeustions and someone asked same kind of question and he said that it is JAIZ but now I came to know some people who say that it is haram. I am so confused and sad as I cannot discuss it with anyone in our family because we hide it from everyone.Please guide me if it is JAIZ or not as I cannot have kids otherwise. If someone does not do it intentionally I mean if someone does not know that its JAIZ or not is there any Kafara? My aunt will adopt my baby and if its haram ,I will not have children anymore. Please tell me what to do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nThe child will be legitimate if the insemination is between the husband and wife. There is no Kaffara for having the child through artificial insemination.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
