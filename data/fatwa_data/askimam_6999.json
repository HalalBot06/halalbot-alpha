  "question": "is the book Noorus Sudoor if Sharhil Quboor - by Allama Jalaluddin Suyuti) authentic?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs the book 'Noorus-Sudoor Fi Sharhil Quboor' (by Allama Jalaluddin Suyuti) authentic? and written by him only? b) It quotes Ibn al-Qayyim's book 'Kitab-ar-Rooh' stating that the souls of the dead come and meet the souls of people that are alive? c) if also states that dead people recite Quran, pray, meet each other, enquire the state of the world from a newly arrived soul etc., is this true? d) if the souls are in Illiyeen or Sijeen , then why is it permissible to address souls directly at the grave using 'Ya'? like \"Asalamu-alaikum ya Abu Bakr Siddiq (r.a)\"at his grave in Madina? e) could you tell me more about souls? where are they? and i would be very thankful if you could recommend me some authentic book on souls\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We are not in possession of this Kitaab, hence, we are unable to comment on its authenticity.\n\n2. Nevertheless, there is a difference of opinion about the condition of the soul once it leaves the body. Some say that the soul returns to the grave at the time of questioning and then leaves, whilst most scholars say that the souls only return to the body after resurrection. Nevertheless, the souls of the martyrs and all the believers go to Illiyyeen which is in Jannat above the seventh heaven and the souls of all the disbelievers go to the Sijjeen which is in Jahannum beneath the seventh. Various Ahaadith substantiate this and also mention that the souls meet each other and ask about conditions in the world. It is not far fetched that they recite Qur?aan, prey, etc. This is in the complete knowledge of Allah Ta?ala alone, beyond our comprehension.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
