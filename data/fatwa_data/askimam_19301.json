  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAt the moment, no one in my family is working other than me. I have a part time job and also go to university full-time. My family is living on welfare, so we don;t have a lot. So my father asks me for money, he expects me to give him some of my money from every pay cheque I get to help him out with the family. However, even when I give the money, he asks for me and doesn't seem satisfied with it. I don;t know if I'm doing the right thing by giving him the money. As well, my family doesn;t know about this, this is only between my father and I. The only reason why i give him money is because im his daughter and i just want to help out. But now I think he is just taking advantage and consistently asking for money whenever. So my question is: Am i doing the right thing? Am i obligated to give him money? Like I don;t know what to do. I pray for him to get a job but I don;t know.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssal훮mu `alaikum Warahmatull훮hi Wabrakatuh,\n\nYour contribution to your father is sadaqah (voluntary charity). You will be greatly rewarded for the sadaqah to your father. The general rule of sadaqah is to give according to ones financial ability. If you cannot give your father more than what you are presently giving, you should explain the reason in a most appropriate and suitable way with regret and kindness.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'훮la Knows Best,\n\nMuft카 Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
