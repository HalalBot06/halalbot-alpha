  "question": "I would like to know, if when we pass wind (fart) , should we then also say ALHAMDULLILAH, because for sure it is through ALLAH (SWT) will that we have been able to be relieved",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a question of doahs on different occasions...\n\nI have learnt that when someone sneezes , he should thank Allah (SWT) i.e say Alhamdulillah . Similarly if someones falls or gets injured then also he should thanks Allah(SWT) for that person could have got more serious injuries.\n\nSo, for many occasions, where we have been relieved from serious injuries or other things which could be more injurious to us, we should thank ALLAH (SWT).\n\nI would like to know, if when we pass wind (fart) , should we then also say ALHAMDULLILAH, because for sure it is through ALLAH (SWT) will that we have been able to be relieved by the pain that this (wind/fart) causes in our body. Similarly, is this also valid when we go to relieve us in toilet. That is if we should say Alhamdullilah?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe should thank Allah for every gift He has bestowed us with. However, in doing so, we should maintain respect and dignity. It is precisely for this that we do not recite any du’aa when in the toilet as that condition is not one of respect.\n\nWe thank Allah when we leave the toilet.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
