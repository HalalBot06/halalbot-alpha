  "question": "Is there a specific du'a or salat that a couple can perform when trying to have a baby?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy doctor told me that I most likely will not be able to conceive a baby without the use of donor eggs. This is not an option in Islam. Allah(swt) is better than any doctor. Are their specific prayers my husband and I should perform to ask God for this blessing?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nGranting children is the sole decree of Allah Ta'ala. Whilst many people\nyearn to have children, others grieve the disobedience of their children.\nOften, we regard something as bad whilst it is good in the sight of Allah.\nHowever, Allah is the greatest gifter (Wahhaab).\n\nYou should invoke His mercy whilst making Du'aa with his quality of Wahhaab.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
