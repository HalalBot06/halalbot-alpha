That's why I pray salat at home. my younger sister also pray salat, So would it not be better for us to make jama'at at home and in this case will we get 27th times reward. and please describe the position of iqtida in this case. jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe commend you for your enthusiasm for Deen. May Allah Ta?ala increase your steadfastness, Aameen.\n\nYou may perform Jamaat at home with your sister whereby you may earn the rewards of Jamaat. However, when making Jamaat with your sister, she should stand at a distance behind you. It is necessary for you as the Imaam to make the intention of being Imaam for the women.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
