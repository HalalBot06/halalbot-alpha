  "question": "The gynae said i shouldn't fast",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have been sterilised and at the begin of Ramadaan ,( the first taraweeg)  we found out that I am pregnant after the gynae then believing that it is a pregnancy in the tubes (ectopic) they immediately admitted me to hospital to have surgery to terminate the pregnancy on the first day of Ramadaan,  I recited Yaseen before entering surgery and placed it in the Almighty hands.  When I awoke from surgery I was told I am still pregnant and that he foetus is in the uterus.  I believe this is a gift from Allah, we make plans but the Almighty has greater plans for us.  We so pleased and say shukr to Allah , we now make duaah for a healthy baby inshallah.  Because of these cirumstances we would like to give the baby a name meaning gift from God, gift from Allah,  I have come accross the name Ayaan male meaning gift from God and Anum female meaning gift from God,  is these good acceptable muslim names or if you can suggest alternatives with similiar meaning. \n\n \n\nAlso in the first trimester I asked my Gynae if I could fast and he said no.  I feel a bit guilty about this,  each time I ask my husband if I should fast alternative , he also wont allow me to.  I am planning to pay back each day like I did with a previous pregnancy.  Should I be feeling so guilty , should I pay for the month the days I was not able to fast as I am planning to make it up inshallah.  Or if one pay must you still pay back the days you did not fast.  Shukran for your time please advise eagerly awaiting.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is mentioned in the Hadith that the most beloved names to allah are abdullah( slave of allah) and abdur rahman( slave of the compassionate).For females it would be Amatullah and Amatur Rahman(same meaning).\n\nA righteous muslim doctor should advise you whether you can manage fasting or not.If you are unable to fast you should keep the missed fasts after childbirth( when you are strong enough).You need not pay any fidyah.This will only be paid if there is no hope of you fasting in future.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
