  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI understand that sexual intercourse with a woman during her menstruation is forbiden. But how about giving a woman in that state orgasm by stimulting her through masturbation. Would that be permissible?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIt will not be permissible for a man to touch any part of a woman from the navel to the knees during the period of her menses. Hence stimulating her through masturbation will fall under the same ruling.\n\n(Bahisti Zewar, Zam Zam Publishers, Vol 1, Page 92)[1]\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl.
