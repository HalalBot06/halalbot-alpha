  "question": "Are there any true wahhabis not like the modern day salafi. Also is it true that deoband is part of the wahhabi movement",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI read the thing on one of your fatwas about the history of the wahhabi movement. Are there any true wahhabis not like the modern day salafi. Also is it true that deoband is part of the wahhabi movement\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe term ?Wahhaabi? is greatly misunderstood. It is for that reason we have placed the history of the Wahhaabi movement on our site.\n\nIn principle, if a person?s beliefs and Aqaaid claiming to be a Wahhaabi is according to the beliefs and Aqaid of the Ahlus sunnah Wal Jamaa, then only he is on the right path. Any deviation from the path of the Ahlus sunnah Wal Jamaa is not acceptable. The Ulama of Deoband subscribe and strictly adhere to the beliefs and Aqaaid of Ahlus sunnah Wal Jamaa.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
