  "question": "Is is permissible to peform the Jumu'ah prayer with a jamaat in an open field (i.e. not in a musjid)? The Tabliqi Jamaat holds the Friday prayer in a tent during their annual ijtima.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe Tabliqi Jamaat holds the friday prayer in a tent during their annual ijtima. Can anyone thus put up a mimbar and invite the Muslims to congregate there for the Jumu'ah prayer? Is it compulsory to hold the Jumu'ah salaat in an established Musjid?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe validity of a Jummu'ah Salaat is not dependant on it being performed in\na Masjid. It may be performed in a Jamaat Khana or an open field as well.\nTherefore, the Jummu'ah performed during the Ijtima in a tent on an open\nfield is valid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
