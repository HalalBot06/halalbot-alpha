  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Respected Mufti Saheb, Is it permissible to put money in the Bank. Also if we have a choice of an intrest or non-intrest account what should we do? Please Give Details. Jazakallah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOne may deposit money in a bank account for safeguarding on condition\nthat one does not use any of the interest earned.
