  "question": "What is \"chugli\"? It is always discussed alongside Gheebat, what is the sinfor committing such an act?4) What is the gunnah for missing one namaz, i find it hard to wake up to perform Fajr",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Chugli is an Urdu word which means gossiping. Gheebat is backbiting. Both, gossiping and backbiting are common in causing mischief. Allah likens backbiting to a person who eats the flesh of his fellow brother. Gossiping is a major sin and also a means of punishment in the grave.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] has mentioned that the 2 Salaats are very difficult on a hypocrite. They are Esha and Fajar. Further, Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] mentioned that a person who misses one Salaat will have to spend a Haqab in the fire of hell and one Haqab is equal to 70 years, and in terms of the Aakhirat, 1 year is equal to 1000 years. In reality, the person will spend 70,000 years in the fire. Laziness is not an excuse to miss Fajr. Make an effort to; a) Sleep early, b) Set your alarm away from your bed.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Read the last 4 aayaats of Surah Kahf with the firm intention to wake up for Fajr. If, after making this effort, you are unable to wake up, then Allah Ta?ala is All-Forgiving but don?t use laziness as an excuse. Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] has mentioned that that person who wakes up for Fajr, he has woken up with the flag of Allah Ta?ala, meaning that this person has Imaan in his heart and the person who skips Fajr and wakes up to his occupation has woken with the flag of Shaytaan, meaning that there is fear that this person will lose his Imaan.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
