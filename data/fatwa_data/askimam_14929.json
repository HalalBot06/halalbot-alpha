  "question": "In this situation will \"A\" get punishment equal to khun baha in the court of Allah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n\"A\" stole money of  \"B\" and after steeling the money  \"A\" died.  \"A\" died before \"B\". After the death of  \"A\" due to the tension of that stolen money  \"B\" died. As  \"A\" died before  \"B\" so how he can pay khun baha, as  \"A\" is not alive so no khun baha has paid because  \"A\" is not alive at the time of death of  \"B\". In this situation will  \"A\" get punishment equal to khun baha in the court of Allah ? OR \"A\" will  get the punishment of theft only ? (the neyaat of   \"A\"  was not to kill  \"B\" ).\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThere is no Khun baha on A. He did not physically kill B. A will be held accountable for theft in the court of Allah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
