  "question": "Before I perform Wudhu for Salaah do I need to wash my private part with water or is it sufficient to remove the soiled toilet paper?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a perpetual urine problem. I have been to the doctors and hakims but the problem remains.I have drops of urine that fall after I urinate. This lasts for at least 30 min to 1 hour after I urinate. I normally place a thick piece of toilet paper in my underpants to prevent my clothes from being messed.\n\nMy question is : Before I perform Wudhu for Salaah do I need to wash my private part with water or is it sufficient to remove the soiled toilet paper?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is sufficient to remove the soiled toilet paper. However, it is advisable to sprinkle some water in your undergarment. That will help you alleviate any doubts of urine drops thereafter.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
