  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nImam pls tell me what are rights of a an unmarried pregnant woman. Is she allowed in the mosque since the child was conceived in a haram state. And what  will happen to the illegitimate child? Is there fater under an obligation to the mother and the child.\n\nShukran\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to the Shari’ah, if a person committed fornication or adultery, that is a major sin. Such a person will be punished in an Islmic state under the laws of Hudood. If the person is not in an Islamic state or the person was not convicted, then he/she should repent to Allah for committing the sin. This is a matter between the individual and Allah. The community does not have any independent right to take any action against the person.\n\nA child born out of wedlock is not attributed to the biological father. It is the mother that bears all the responsibilities of such a child.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
