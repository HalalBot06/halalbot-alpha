JazakAllah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo study Islamic studies at secular universities could pose a problem to\nyour Imaan. The course work that is offered is prepared by orientalists and\ntheir views are very damaging to Islam.\n\nAs for getting a job, there are ample jobs in the field of Islamic studies\nat our primary and secondary schools.
