  "question": "To seek the help of any deceased and pray to him is Shirk",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nReference to Question 6636 in which you mentioned To seek the help of any deceased and pray to him is Shirk. It is not permissible to address any deceased by saying 'Yaa Shaykh Madad', etc. I came to know an incident where the same sort of thing happened which mentioned in the above referenced question. A person went to a Mazar of a Famous Bazurg of Deen and asked that he needs 20,000 rupees and keep this thing saying for around 2 hours or so. In my view it is shirk as you have mentioned but when I asked the Imam of our Masjid that please explain this to me then he said the Aqeeda of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah is that Prophet (SAW) , The Anbiyaa (Alayhis salaam) , The prophets (Alayhis salaam) , Bazurgan-e-Deen, Aulia Ikram are alive in their graves and if someone ask them directly (Talking to them) that they need this thing and have a Neeat that Allah has given the treasures to those people and they are asking them that give us from the treasures Allah has given you Then it will not be shirk. He also mentioned that this practice should not be followed but this cannot be called as shirk. But if they have Neeat that only this can provide us then it will be Shirk. Please explain. JazakAllah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFor one to have this concept that these Anbiyaa or pious servants of Allah have access to certain treasures, there needs to be proof to substantiate it. One cannot merely assume this.\n\nIf there is no proof to substantiate this, it will be incorrect to have such a Niyyah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH SCIENCES\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
