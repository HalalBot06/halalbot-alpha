  "question": "Are you allowed to wear colour contact lense if you are not married, but are eyesight ones. It is not that you want to wear it to impress people but you want to wear it for your slef?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf contact lenses are prescribed by an Optometrist due to medical reasons, it is permissible. It is permissible for a female to beautify herself only for her husband with contact lenses. If there is a possibility of any deception by wearing contact lenses, for example, a boy seeing a girl with the intention of marriage, then she cannot wear coloured contact lenses. It is not permissible for a male to beautify himself with coloured contact lenses.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
