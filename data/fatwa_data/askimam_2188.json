  "question": "In the Hanafi school, if the sun begins to rise before one finishes Fajr, does the prayer become invalid?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSimilarly, if the sun begins to set before one finishes Asr, does that prayer become invalid? Thank you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the sun rises during the Fajr Salaat, then the Salaat will be\ninvalidated. However, if it sets during the Asr prayer, performance of\nSalaat at this time will be Makrooh (detestable) but should be completed.\n(Hidaaya vol.1)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
