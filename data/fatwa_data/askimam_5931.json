  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would want to know how and how much are two prospective marriage alliances allowed to interact via email or phone. Is it okay to ask about each other's personalities with a view to understanding and building trust with each other. How does the present trend of knowing each other through emails,phone calls, even if the topics are sometimes islamic fit in the islamic perspective. Especially dragging this process over a long period without committing.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAny form of relationship, either by phone or email, etc. is strictly\nprohibited.\n\nThe prospective spouses are strangers to each other just as any other\nstrangers. If the prospective partner is found, one should go ahead with the\nNikah even if the marriage is not immediately consummated. The Nikah itself\nwill permit all forms of contact.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
