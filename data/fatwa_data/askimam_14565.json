In a normal situation, that is as a Muslim, and being an owner of the store and/or being wealth, it is prohibited to sell lottery, pork and cigarettes. However, if the store belongs to a non-Muslim, and you are poor and needy, you have to support yourself and dependants and there is no source of income besides the store you are working in which Haraam items are also sold, then you will be excused for working there. You should also make Tawbah and Istighfaar and search for another suitable and Shariâ€™ah compliant source of income.\n\n2. It is permissible to work for a security company transferring monies to the Bank.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
