  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am in a relationship with my cousin sister and we both respect our families. So according to islam is it legal for me to marry her? If my family is against this marriage what should I do?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\n \n\nYou are a ghair mahram to your cousin sister. Ghair mahram is an Arabic term which means not haraam or not prohibited. Contextually it means it is not haraam or not prohibited for you to marry your cousin sister. In principle, any male who can marry a female in Shariah must observe hijaab from each other. They should be completely separate from each other.\n\n \n\nAny form of communication between two such persons is strictly prohibited. It is not permissible for you to have any relationship with your cousin sister, whatever the form of relationship may be. If you are inclined to your cousin sister, you should discuss this with your parents and seek their wise council. You should consider the advice and guidance of your parents. They know you. They love you. They have the experiences of life and their advice to you will be motivated by their love for you.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
