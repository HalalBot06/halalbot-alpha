  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhen the intending hujaaj have to leave their homes, it is advised that they perform two raka'aat salaatul tawbah.\n\nDoes this salaah have to be performed only by those intending to go on hajj, or by the families and friends as well who happen to be there at the time preior to departure. Also, must this be done silently or aloud?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe practice of performing Salaatul Tawbah is meritorious and rewardable. We all are in need of Tawbah at all times due to our inclination to sin. However, the practice of Salaatul Tawbah specifically to be performed before embarking on the jorueny for Hajj is not established.\n\nAlternatively, two Rakaats Salaatul Safar may be performed with the hope of a safe journey and a safe return. This Salaat should be performed individually and silently by those embarking on a journey. (Kabeeri pg.430; Lahore)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
