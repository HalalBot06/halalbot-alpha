  "question": "Is there any time limit in Islam for a man to stay away from his wife?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am staying away from my wife as part of my job for the last 6 months. During this period I didn't have any wet dreams I didn't masturbate. So for the last 6 months I don't have any mani flow from me. Will it cause any problem for my married life? Is Islam has set any time limit for a person to stay away from his wife. Expecting your answer. Jazakallahu Khairan\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe principle in the matter of staying away from the wife is that a man may\nonly stay away from his wife for such a period in which the wife's chastity\nis not in danger and she will not incline towards other men. This period\nwill differ from person to person. To stay away longer than this is sinful.\n\nSome jurists have stipulated 4 months on the basis that Hadhrat Umar\n(Radhiallaahu Anhu) was informed in his time that a woman cannot stay\nwithout her husband for more than four months. (Imdaadul Ahkaam vol.2\npg.381)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
