She is a Ghayr Mahram (not prohibited in marriage) to you. She is not your real sister and therefore you ought to have observed Hijaab from her.\n\nAs an adult, you have an independent right to marry a person of your choice. At the same time, you should consider the opinion of your mother as that is motivated by her love for you. She knows what is best for you. We advise you open your heart and consider the opinion of your mother and inform her that you will make Istikhaara. If you still feel negative after making Istikhaara, then express that to your mother.\n\nIn this approach, it is not expected of your mother to be upset with you as you sincerely considered her opinion, but due to the indication in the Istikhaara, you could not risk committing to marriage.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
