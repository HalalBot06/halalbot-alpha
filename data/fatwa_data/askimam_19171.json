  "question": "I'm pregnant and spotted a little. Do I have to perform ghusl?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am 6 weeks pregnant but last night I spotted a little. Should I perform ghusl for tahārah or not?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nNo, you do not have to perform ghusl because the “spotting” you saw was istihāda (irregular bleeding).[i]\n\nIstihāda does, however, negate wudhū unless one qualifies as a ma'zūr (excused person).
