  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI recently heard a lecture, where the Moulana stated the Rasoolullah sallallahu alayhi wasallam is Haazir & Naazir, as Allah has said in the Holy Quraan, INNA ARSALNAAKA SHAAHIDAW WAMUBASSHIRAW WANAZEERA. - and he explained that for anybody to be a SHAAHID, meaning WITNESS, he has to be present -  but he goes on to say that this does not mean the Rasoolullah sallallahu alayhi wasallam is OMNIPRESENT.\n\nHe mentioned that this was the beleif of Imam Abu Hanifa as well as Sheikh Abdul Qader Jilaani rahmatullah alay.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nThe belief of Ahlu Alsunnath wal Jammath is that the Rasoolullah sallallahu alayhi wasallam is resting in his grave.  Haazir & Naazir are both Arabic words, when used together, refer to a being which is omnipresent and omniscient. \nThis can be only Allah's attribute.  To believe that someone other than Allah has a quality like this would mean that we are ascribing partners to Allah in his attributes which is known as shirk fe alsiffat.\n\nAs for the word 'Sahid' in (Surath 33 Ayath 46), it has been repeated in the Quraan a number of times. It could have three meanings:\n\n1.    Rasoolullah sallallahu alayhi wasallam will testify on the day of Judgement for the Ummah as well as against it.\n2.    He is a testifier to the Kaliamth Shadath  \n3.    He is an informer in this world about the happenings of the after life, and is a wittiness in the hereafter to the righteous and evil actions that took place in this life.\n\nIn order to fulfill any one of the three obligations, it is not necessary for the Prophet to be present and   watching us at all times. Nevertheless, we have ahadeeth that prove that the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam is informed about our actions whilst resting in his grave.  \n\nReferences:\nTafseer Razi;\nThe Differences in the Umma and the Straight Path (Urdu edition) V.1 P.30  Darul Isshat\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam \n\nMl.
