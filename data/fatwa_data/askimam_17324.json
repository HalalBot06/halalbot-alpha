  "question": "Is this considered as a form of life insurance?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am writing from Croydon, London, UK.  We are grateful for all the time that Mufti saheb has provided to us.\n\nI am a member of a local government pension scheme.  There is a death benefit for my wife if i pass away of a lump sum of many thousands of pound.  Is this considered as a form of life insurance?  If so, is the best thing to remove myself from the scheme?\n\nWhat is the process of ghusl for a new born baby?\n\nIn the UK we have many reward schemes from retailers, where when you purchase something, you acquire points which are then converted to discounts on other items and money off vouchers at a later time.  Are these permissible?\n\nJazakallah for your time and efforts.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1.       If this pension scheme is optional, it tantamount to life insurance. Hence, not permissible. However, if this scheme is not optional and you do not have any say in the monthly premium, the benefit your wife will receive as the beneficiary will be regarded as a gift or contribution from the government scheme.\n\n2.       The baby should be washed to remove all forms of najaasat.\n\n3.       Yes, such schemes are permissible provided you don’t pay anything above the purchase price. These are merely incentives to attract the potential customer.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
