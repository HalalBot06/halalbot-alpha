  "question": "Which one is better, should I asked her to be more independent (she can ride motorbike actually), should I asked favours from other people ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am going to Japan shortly, and I am going to take my family Insha Allah after 6 months. At the moment, my family rarely go out form the house. Paying electricity, bills taking children to school etc.. I have to do it myself but it's time consuming. But I expect her to be more independent which means have to go out from the house. We can actually ask other people to pay for electricity etc. but we feel bad in asking them many times. Which one is better, should I asked her to be more independent (she can ride motorbike actually), should I asked favours from other people ?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIn principle, a woman may leave the house out of necessity on condition she adheres to the laws of hijab. Your wife may fulfill the duties referred to in your email in your absence. In doing so, she should observe hijab when she leaves the house.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
