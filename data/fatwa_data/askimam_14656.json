  "answer": "QUESTION\nHello, I am a British born 21 year old. My family moved to Pakistan a few years back and I stayed on in the UK to study. I was never really fond of moving to Pakistan even before we moved. I used to voice my concerns to my parents but they would never listen or understand. This would often lead to verbal arguments and sometimes I would get really angry and physically break things. This whole movement of moving to Pakistan really affected my life (it made me commit more sin) and my development (I fell I could have achieved more in life if this problem didn’t exist). I am now in Pakistan and I am trying to be understanding of my parents needs. They want me to live in Pakistan but I find this almost impossible. I feel it is such a backward country with no human rights. The people here have no education or life skills; everyone is trying to cheat you. As I am older I am trying to be more understanding of my parents, hence the reason I am here. But I can’t stay here. Pakistan is meant to an Islamic country but I believe that’s only by name. I feel as I commit more sins here as I constantly get angry with the public about the way I am treated which makes me lash out in mostly verbal ways. The youth here have no idea as they are trying to copy people of the West and end up committing more sins as they don’t know their limits. I have voiced my concerns to my parents and they say to me that you can go where ever you want. I am an only son so therefore there is nobody to live with them. But they never understand my point and this really annoys me. Sometimes I even think that living in Pakistan is a punishment. There is no opportunity here whatsoever. I am not saying the UK is heaven, far from it, but at least it is more civilized and for some reason I find it easier to practice my religion there than in Pakistan. I really want to leave here; the only thing holding me back at the moment is my parent’s happiness. This is despite our relationship is very poor. We never discuss anything. Even if I slightly question what they tell me, I am told I am un-appreciative and that I have no religion in my life. This really puts you off. Surely when older, a child’s relationship with their parents should be warming and like friends where anything can be discussed. What should I do? This is a really big dilemma for me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nMany people agree with the sentiments expressed by you. has not seen the day it was meant to be established for. is not heaven just as is not. As a son, you should be respectful to your parents. Contain yourself if your parents require your service and they cannot take care of themselves without you, then you should be patient and serve them. If that is not the case, then as an adult, you may choose to go where you wish. Make Istikhara and go by what the out come of the Istikhara. That should be agreeable to you and your parents.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nThe ask imam site will not process questions from October 23 till October 27.
