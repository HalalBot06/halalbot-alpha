  "question": "I would like to know what are the duties of a daughter after marriage towards her parents",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWe are five sisters and have no brothers.\nMy father is the only earning member of the family and he stays abroad.I used to help in all the household matters.But I got married last month.My parents wont take any help from me anymore.\nI would like to know what are the duties of a daughter after marriage towards her parents.Alhamdulillah my husband is a God fearing person and would be happy to oblige.\n                                                                                          \n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nMay Allah Ta'ala reward you for your willingness to assist your parents and siblings.\n\nAccording to Shari'ah, it is the duty of the husband to provide the financial needs for his wife and minor children. It is the joint responsibility of the husband and wife to nurture their children in a proper manner. It is only natural for you to worry about your mother and siblings since you will be leaving. However, now that you will be joining your new husband overseas, he will be responsible for your care and not your parents. Therefore, you may assist your mother and siblings out of good will if your husband gives you permission. Besides this, the duties of a married daughter towards her parents are to respect them and obey them in all commands as long as it is not something against the Shari'ah.     \n\nIf the household affairs become difficult to manage once you leave and your mother needs assistance, then it will be the duty of your father to either make arrangements for your mother and siblings to join him in the country where he works or he should return to your country and seek alternative, suitable employment there so that he may be able to live with the family and assist them in all affairs.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
