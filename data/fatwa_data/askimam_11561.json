  "question": "If some one is getting Employment Insurance Benefits,can he work a cash job? if it is not allowed by the state to get double benefits.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome of my friends argue that from non Muslim state you can get as much money as you can,and there is no compulsion to obey the agreement between Muslim and a Kuf'r state.Jazakallah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, Muslims living in a non-Muslim country must abide by all these laws of the country that are not un-Islamic. If it is illegal, then it is not permissible to get employment insurance benefits as well as earn through cash job.\n\nFurthermore, Muslims must live with dignity and honour. Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] advised that it is not appropriate to do anything that will cause disgrace to a Muslim. If a Muslim is convicted of such a crime, it will be a bad reflection of Muslims and Islam. Surely, we can sacrifice a few pennies to maintain our dignity, respect of Muslims and Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
