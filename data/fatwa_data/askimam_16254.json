  "question": "Will it be required to have a ghusl for purity if urine drops fall on me ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. In our student housing there are only high commodes. What if splashed water during toilet touches some of the body part? Will it be required to have a ghusl for purity ?\n\n 2.Can i wash the clothes with najasat (mani) and without najasat together in a domestic (student housing) waching machine ? Will those remain pure?\n\n3.The fresh chicken market in Saudi Arabia is no more visible. So people are now in a spot  of bother who were the regular customer of fresh chicken . Some of them rely on the words of the chicken sellers (those chicken sellers used to sell fresh chickens) who say that they have arranged the slaughtering according to shariah but one has to order earlier  (may be 1 day before the delivery ) to get the chicken in time . So , when the chickens are delivered they are already cleaned and cut into pices. How can we be sure about those chickens ?\n\n4.What if i put najasat clothes and normal dirty clothes in washing powder in a bucket for several hours ? Do all of them become najasat clothes?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1.      When using a high pan (western) toilet, one should do whatever it takes to avoid the splashes of water touching the body, for example, pour water slowly or place tissue in the pan to absorb the water etc. If precaution is taken, there won’t be a need to make ghusl.\n\n2.      Impure clothing washed in a domestic washing machine will become pure.\n\n3.      In principle, if an upright and honest person informs that the chicken are halal and there is no reason to doubt his information, then it will be permissible to rely on his information and consume the chicken.\n\n4.      In impure clothes are put together with pure clothes and washing powder, the water will become impure thus rendering all the clothes to become inpure.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
