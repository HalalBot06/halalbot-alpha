  "question": "Can a hanafi read Asr once the Shafi time for Asr has set in(Hanafi time for Asr has not yet set in-usually Asr for Shafi starts earlier then that of Hanafi)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf I am Hanafi, & the masaajid in the area follow the Shaafi madhab, can I join in the jamaat for Asr even tho' the Hanafi time for Asr has not yet set in / for convenience eg while travelling, can I read Asr salaat as soon as the Shafi time has set in\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYes, it will be permissible to read Asr in a Shaafi Musjid once the time for Asr Salaat sets in.\n\nFor convenience during travelling, it will be better to read the Asr Salaat in its last time just before the time for Maghrib Sets in and then read the Maghrib Salaat once the Maghrib time sets in. (Tirmidhi pg.42; Ashrafi)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
