  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) I am going to make someone Muslim we love each other, can we just meet and talk? If I love her a lot and want to be with her but also not be with her because i dunno if we 'll ever get enganged because i might not make a good husband Can I see her ones and/or do something later?or you gime advice 2)If this is time for Jihad what are we Muslims waiting for?Why aren't we attacking the Kaffirs yet?I say we help with Jihad. What do you think should happen now? Afghanistan needs us! Shukran\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo invite a non-muslim to Islam is indeed an act of great virtue if it is\nperformed with sincerity. There should be no personal interest in that. If\nyou sincerely wish to convert the person to Islam, you should do so not\nbecause of love. We also advise you refer her to a scholar as you are young\nand your communicating with her could lead to immorality. It is haram\n(strictly prohibited) to communicate with a Ghair Mahram ( not prohibited in\nmarriage) female. To supress your Nafs (desire) against communicating with\nthe girl is indeed jihad against your Nafs. It is only when the Nafs makes\nJihad, then one will be fit to physically participate in Jihad against Kufr\n(disbelief).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
