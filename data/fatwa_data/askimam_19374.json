  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nEvery year during Ramadhan and Eid, the differences on the moon issue surfaces which brings about enormous problems. Our Ramadhan and Eid get spoiled with the in-fighting. Ramadhan ought to be a month of spiritual upliftment and Eid, a day of enjoyment. We lose both; no spirituality and no enjoyment. What is your advise so that we do not loose the roohaniyyat of Ramadhan and the enjoyment of Eid through in-fighting?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nThe academic opinions of the various Ulama on the moon issue in the U.K are well known. It was expected that such academic contributions would ultimately bear the fruits of making the correct decision.\n\nNon co-operation and acrimony have been the stumbling block in making progress.\n\nIn academic issues, the mind must prevail over emotions. Disagreement should be in an agreeable manner.\n\nWhen academic differences lead to acrimony, that is very un-academic. It becomes very difficult for people of dignity and honour to contribute any further to such a course.\n\nTo get caught in the web of acrimony and humiliating ones counterpart is counterproductive and detrimental to ones Imaan.\n\nWhat was once supposed to be a pure academic issue is now an issue of ones Nafs and ego.\n\nThe only seeable solution for the time being is:\n\n·        Academic issues should be confined to the Ulama and Muftis who are expected to address these issues within their ranks with decorum and honour.\n\n·        The layman is not tasked by Shariah to engage on academic issues. They are ordered to follow their Ulama.\n\n·        When the Ulama differ, don’t interfere. Never ever condemn any Alim or humiliate him.\n\n·        Simply place your trust in your Alim of trust and abide by his decision.\n\n·        There is no point in questioning his decision as you cannot be his judge.\n\n·        If anyone, be it your friend or family, places his trust in one Alima nd abides by his decision, then respect his decision. If you care for your roohaniyat of Ramadhan or enjoyment of Eid, you will not confront him on his decision.\n\nThis approach will not eradicate the differences but will surely control the differences so that one does not loose the roohaniyat of Ramadhan and enjoyment of Eid in in-fighting.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best,\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
