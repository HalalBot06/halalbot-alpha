  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nI am writing in for advice, as I have now been suffering on and off for around 6-7 years.\n\n \n\nI seem to have done something to my wrists both right and left, but the right is a lot more severe, most likely while at the gym, and as a result I tend to get a lot of pains. Initially when it happen around 2004 I had difficulty holding a pen in my right hand. I have had this looked at by number of experts, Physio, Osteopath, had X-Ray and MRI scans done but to no avail. They have not been able to find the cause of the problem, which has resulted in not really having any form of treatment to cure this, I am still young so I guess I have ‘put up with it’ but I’m not sure later in life when I reach an older age I will be able to keep with the pain.\n\n \n\nI understand you are not doctors but I would like to know the things which I could either pray or eat from an Islamic point of view, to either cure the problem or make my wrists stronger? I’m sure the prophet (pbuh) has suggested things which are a good healer and suggested dua’s and ayahs from the Quran to recite in difficult times.\n\n \n\nI have obviously tried the normal method of trying doctors etc. but don’t feel they will be able to find the cause of the issue, as whichever specialist I go to they suggest things based on their expertise, so one would say it’s your bone, another would say it’s your tissue, another would say it’s your nerve.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIt is unfortunate to hear of your plight. May Almighty Allāh grant you complete Shifā (cure) of your wrists.\n\nOne should bear in mind that at times Almighty Allāh tests his servants. Allāh states in the Holy Qurān:\n\n\"We will certainly test you with something of fear, hunger, deficiency of wealth, self and produce. And glad tidings to those who are patient.\"                    (Surah Baqarah)\n\nTherefore, you should not become despondent. Perhaps this is your test from Allāh. Allāh tests those whom He loves. Thus, if cure is decreed for you by Allāh, no one can stop it.\n\nAs you have stated, we are not doctors and cannot prescribe treatment. However, we know the only healer of all sickness' is Allāh Ta ̒āla,  and we should seek our treatment from Him.\n\nHazrat ̒Ā isha Radhiyallāhu ̒anhā stated that Rasulullāhi Sallallāhu ̒Alaihi Wa Sallam used to seek protection of his family by passing his right hand (over them) and saying:\n\n\"Oh Allāh! lord of Humanity! Remove harm, cure him. You are the one who cures. There is no cure except Your cure. (such a cure) which will not be followed by a sickness.\"\n\n(Bukhari) [1]\n\nTherefore, practice on this by passing your hands over your wrist and reading the d̒uā.\n\nAnother cure for sickness from the Holy Qurān is \"Surāh Fātiha\". Read Surāh Fātiha and blow over your wrists with conviction that Almighty Allāh will grant you cure. Inshā Allāh, you will be cured.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla knows best\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā\n\n\n\n\n[1] أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم كان يعوذ بعض أهله يمسح بيده اليمنى ويقول اللهم رب الناس أذهب الباس اشفه وأنت الشافي لا شفاء إلا شفاؤك شفاء لا يغادر سقما"
