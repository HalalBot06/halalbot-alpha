  "question": "Could a person bring you bad luck? Some one told me that some people can be 'bad' for a person, is there any reality in this assumption?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI know it sounds weird but I have been very ill since my fiancés father asked for my hand, and another strange thing (Allah knows best) It seems to me that everything my fiancé has ever complimented me on I have lost, I have been ill ever since the engagement, in addition my looks have gone bad, my skills and abilities went worse every time he complimented me on them. I have read many duwas for ?evil eye? and read 5 times namaz and avoid thinking about this but sometimes I can't help but think that maybe Allah is trying to keep us away from each other for a reason. Some one told me that some people can be 'bad' for a person, is there any reality in this assumption? May Allah Bless You for your help (ameen).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMay Allah Ta'ala release you from your distress. First and foremost even if one is proposed your fianc%E9 and his father are still ghair mahram. You cannot communicate with them until your nikaah takes place. Communication, courtship, touching etc will automatically be adultery of the hands, eyes, heart, tongue etc...Hence explain this to them.%0D%0A%0D%0ASecondly if you feeling down and depressed and scared about marriage, have you read Istikhaara salaah? If not do read for a few days and then decide.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs for evil eyes etc ensure you read daily morning and evening 3 times the four suras (Quls) Qul Ya Ayyuhal Kaafirun, Qul Huwal laahu Ahad, Qul aoozu birabbil Falaq, and Qul aoozu birabbin Naas.As far as compliments whenever complimented always read Masha Allah Laa Quuwata illa billah. Nevertheless, you are sounding depressed, build your confidence spoil yourself to some treat and do not focus on your looks, skills, abilities, however do still engage in other hobbies or ventures you may enjoy.%0D%0A%0D%0AOn a final note make tauba with tears and plead your needs and case to Allah Ta'ala and ask Allah Ta'ala, The Most Merciful to guide you and protect you. Do not despair in the Mercy of Allah Ta'ala.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A2SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
