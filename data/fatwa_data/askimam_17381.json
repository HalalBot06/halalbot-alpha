  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n\n\n\nRecently, my father met a person who was a highly known astrologer. My father gave him his date of Birth and he told him so many correct things (no precisely accurate but still close enough) just by looking at date of birth. My father was impressed and he talked to him about the whole family. He again told so many correct things just by drawing something called \"Zaicha\".\nNow, He says he can help us through Quranic verses etc etc. For instance, he said that my brother who is intelligent but is not doing well these days in studies can be helped if he recites certain things from Quran at certain time of the day and number of times. Similarly he has given such readings to all the family for Allah's blessings and help us save from difficult times. But he keeps on insisting that nothing will be out of Quran, which is correct till now because all he has given us is from Quran or things like reciting \"Ya-Allah\" or \"Subhan-Allah\" etc.\n\nSomehow I dont feel convinced with all this, because I feel everybody should pray him/herself to Allah S.W.T and ask for betterment, rather than asking some person for help. My father says the person says himself that he is no one but just because he knows all these things he can provide an umbrella from sunlight and thats all. Also, he gave us few quranic verses on metal to keep with us as well.\n\nMy father is into these things either to clarify things, but he says its not bad to remember Allah S.W.T in a way that can protect us from bad things (which is the focus of this person, who gave him to read stuff, as well)\n\nWhat I want to know, without any reference to any fiqah, that is all this allowed in Islam/Shariah? The fact that a person who has the knowledge to provide you with verses from Quran to help you, may be, reduce the effect of the some thing that might happen or just to help you guide towards the right path leading towards Allah S.W.T. I have heard from a lot of people that Hazrat Ali R.A also had this knowledge and he could draw these Zaicha's and could tell what MIGHT happen and not the exact thing.\n\nQ2: The other question is, if we keep on reciting such stuff, we wouldn't know if it has a negative effect on us or not? Sometimes when we keep reciting verses same verses (sometimes also known as Wazeefa), can they have a negative impact as well?\n\nQ3: What is the ruling on Qasr prayer at your birth place. I live in the UK but if my birth place is Doha and I go there to live for less than 14 days; do I offer qasr prayer or pray as normal?? Please give reference to Hadith etc if possible\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1.       The practice of Zaicha is very similar to the practices of horoscopes, palmistry and other fortunetelling procedures. It uses calculations based on the movement of the planets and stars. In Arabic, these practices are termed as Kahānah. In regards to fortunetelling, Rasūlullah صلى الله عليه و سلم  has stated, “Whoever auspicates (bird divination) or has auspicating done for him; practices fortunetelling or has his fortune told; practices sorcery or has sorcery practiced for him; whoever ties a knot; and whoever visits a fortuneteller and attests to what he says, then he has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم.\n\nوعن عمران بن حصين قال: قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم:\n\n\"ليس منا من تطير أو تطير له،أو تكهن أو تكهن له،أو سحر أو سحر له،ومن عَقد عقدة - أو قال: عُقد عقدة - ومن أتى كاهناً فصدقه بما قال فقد كفر بما أنزل على محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم\".\n\nرواه البزار ورجاله رجال الصحيح خلا إسحاق بن الربيع وهو ثقة. (مجمع الزوائد ج 5 ص 117 , مكتبة القدسي)\n\n \n\nThe Fuqahā (Jurists) also mention that similar to the impermissibility of accepting a wage for such practices, it will not be permissible to pay for such services either. Furthermore, as stated in the Hadīth, there is a strong possibility of a person losing his or her Imān by visiting such people. The Fuqahā also mention that if a person believes himself or another person to have the knowledge of the unseen, then such a person will leave the fold of Islam. Allah Ta‘ālā clearly mentions, “Say, ‘No one in the heavens and the earth has the knowledge of the Unseen except Allah’.” (27:65)\n\nقُلْ لَا يَعْلَمُ مَنْ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ الْغَيْبَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ َ\n\nTo believe that another person also has the knowledge of the unseen will be disbelief in this verse of the Qur'ān; thus, expelling the person from the ranks of the Muslims. Thus, it will not be permissible to visit them despite the fact that they prescribe certain Ayāt and other Wazeefahs to recite.  \n\n \n\nالقاعدة الرابعة عشرة : ما حرم أخذه حرم إعطاؤه 1 – كالربا ومهر البغي وحلوان الكاهن…\n\nقوله : وحلوان الكاهن إلخ : المراد به ما يعطى للمنجم إذ الكهانة انقطعت بمولده صلى الله عليه وسلم (غمز عيون البصائر في شرح الأشباه والنظائر ج 1 ص 391 , ادارة القران)\n\n \n\nمطلب في الكاهن والعراف قوله: (الكاهن قبل كالساحر) في الحديث من أتى كاهنا أو عرافا فصدقه بما يقول فقد كفر بما أنزل على محمد أخرجه أصحاب السنن الاربعة، وصححه الحاكم عن أبي هريرة.\n\nوالكاهن كما في مختصر النهاية للسيوطي من يتعاطى الخبر عن الكائنات في المستقبل ويدعي معرفة الاسرار. والعراف: المنجم. وقال الخطابي: هو الذي يتعاطى معرفة مكان المسروق والضالة ونحوهما اه. والحاصل أن الكاهن من يدعي معرفة الغيب بأسباب وهي مختلفة، فلذا انقسم إلى أنواع متعددة كالعراف، والرمال، والمنجم: وهو الذي يخبر عن المستقبل بطلوع النجم وغروبه، والذي يضرب الحصى والذي يدعي أن له صاحبا من الجن يخبره عما سيكون، والكل مذموم شرعا، محكوم عليهم وعلى مصدقهم بالكفر. وفي البزازية: يكفر بادعاء علم الغيب وبإتيان الكاهن وتصديقه. وفي التتارخانية: يكفر بقوله أنا أعلم المسروقات أو أنا أخبر عن إخبار الجن إياي اه. قلت: فعلى هذا أرباب التقاويم من أنواع الكاهن لادعائهم العلم بالحوادث الكائنة. (حاشية رد المحتار ج 4 ص 242 , سعيد)\n\n \n\nWe have not come across any substantiation to show that Ali رضى الله عنه practiced fortunetelling or any sort of divination whatsoever.\n\n \n\n2.      It is established that Rasūlullah صلى الله عليه و سلم did recite certain Sūrahs and Ayāt of the Holy Qur'ān for remedy such as the Mu‘awwadāt (Sūrahs al-Falaq and al-Nās). However, he has also stated, “O people, carry out such actions that you are able (to bear) for verily Allah does not tire (of rewarding) until you tire. The most beloved actions to Allah are those perpetually carried out, even though they might be less.”\n\nيَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ خُذُوا مِنَ الأَعْمَالِ مَا تُطِيقُونَ ، فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَمَلُّ حَتَّى تَمَلُّوا ،\n\n وَإِنَّ أَحَبَّ الأَعْمَالِ إِلَى اللَّهِ مَا دَامَ وَإِنْ قَلَّ (بخاري ج 7 ص 65 ,دار الفكر)\n\nAt times, people overwhelm themselves with various Wazeefahs by reciting certain verses or Surāh, hundreds or thousands of times. In such a situation, there could be some negative physical and/or psychological side effects. The reason for this is not due to any inherent or intrinsic harm in the verses or Sūrahs, but rather due to the overexertion of the person reciting the verses contrary to the above-mentioned Hadīth.  The best actions and spiritual remedies that a person can carry out are those specifically mentioned in the Hadīth of Rasūlullah صلى الله عليه و سلم . Your father should rather visit a pious ‘Ālim and enquire from him which actions to carry out that are in conformity with the blessed Sunnah of Rasūlullah, which will bring peace and tranquility to his and his family’s life.\n\n \n\n3.      Since your permanent abode is now in UK and you have taken it to be your permanent residence, you should shorten your prayers when visiting your birthplace in Doha for less than 15 days.\n\n \n\n (أو توطنه) أي عزم على القرار فيه وعدم الارتحال وإن لم يتأهل، فلو كان له أبوان ببلد غير مولده وهو بالغ ولم يتأهل به فليس ذلك وطناله، إلا إذا عزم على القرار فيه وترك الوطن الذي كان له قبله (حاشية رد المحتار ج 2 ص 131 , سعيد)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nMl.
