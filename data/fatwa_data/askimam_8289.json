  "answer": "QUESTION\nBut on albalagh.net it says the complete opposite here is the link http://www.albalagh.net/qa/women_cut_hair.shtml please view it and explain who is right you or them & could you have a detailed document of why women cannot cut their hair and how long do they have to keep it growing even if it goes further than their back (waist).and also why some scholars say it is permissible could you give me some info on why they are wrong. Mufti taqi usmani agree?s with what is said albalagh.net\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe reiterate our view that it is not permissible for woman to cut or trim their hair. The only exception to the rule is:\n\n1. A woman may trim her hair on the lower end only to enhance growth, or\n\n2. To equate the level of her hair on the lower.\n\nThe above two does not exceed a few inches. We have corresponded with Mufti Taqi Usmani Saheb and he is of the view that in general it is not permissible for woman to cut or trim their hair with the above two exception. Hereunder is his response to us in seeking clarity on his standpoint on the matter.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
