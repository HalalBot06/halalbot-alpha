  "question": "What is more Saleh in Shariah that a Muslim brother marries the Muslim girl or stick to his promise to his parents knowing that their objections are not valid according to Shariah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs-Salam-U-Alaikum If a Muslim brother proposes to a Muslim girl and her wali and wali gives his consent but tells the muslim brother to send his parents to finalize things. But when he talked to his parents, they refused. Then they agreed to look at the matter with justice. He gave them their word that he'll do whatever they decide. He tried to convince them. All the family members atlast agreed except his father who is not ready to marry his son out of the family and caste. Now muslim brother knows that his parents decision is not just and their objections are not valid according to Shariah. He likes the girl for religion as well. He still wants to marry her. He already tried to convince his parents for 15 months.Can he again talk to his parents even after their decision? What if they still refuse on social rather than religious points? What is more Saleh (good) in Shariah.....that he goes ahead and marry the girl after trying his best to convince his parents or stick to his promise to his parents knowing that their objections are not valid? Will he be doing injustice to the girl? Is his promise to his parents in this matter valid according to Shariah? Jazak Allah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to Shari'ah, every adult has an independent right to choose\nhis/her marriage partner. In view of the above ruling, you may marry the\ngirl in question. However, you should also take cognisance of the\nconsequences of the marriage as your father disagrees for you to marry the\ngirl.\n\nIn our experiences in similar cases, parents follow their emotions and even\ndisown their sons, thus, making life miserable for their sons. If you might\nface the similar response, you should ponder whether you will be able to\nbear such difficulties and weigh those possible difficulties with your\npresent grief. We also suggest you inform your father about your intentions\nand that you will be make Istikhaara (seek divine guidance) on the matter as\nthat is the order of Shari'ah. Somewhere on this site, search 'istikhaara'\n(without quotes)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
