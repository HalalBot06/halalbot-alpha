And hadith or fiqh ruling regarding this matter please clarify. Source if any.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. To greet a person with Salaam is Makrooh [reprehensible] in the Shari’ah on the following situations: 1) To young woman who is not a Mahram, 2) To a nude person, 3) To a person relieving him/herself, 4) To a person involved in playing futile games, e.g. Chess/cards, etc. 5) To a person who is busy with his spouse, 6) To a person who is eating or drinking, 7) To a person engaged in some type of ibaadat, e.g. recitation of Qur’aan, Salaat, etc. (Ahsanul Fataawa vol.8 pg.136)\n\n2. It is Mustahabb [commendable] in the Shari’ah to remain silent and attentive whilst the Adhaan is being called out. Similarly, to disengage oneself from all other activities whilst the Adhaan is being called out is Mustaahabb. The Fuqahaa (jurists) have stated that even if a person is engaged in reciting the Qur’aan, he should pause his recitation and listen to the Adhaan attentively and reply to the Adhaan. The same is applicable to a person engaged in Wudhu where it is Mustahabb for him to pause his Wudhu and listen attentively to the Adhaan. (Raddul Muhtaar vol.1 pg.399)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
