  "question": "Am I required to perform salaat al-qada for all the fard prayers in my life in which I achieved tahara through performing wudu that included mash over modern socks?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have recently learned that my wudu' has been invalid since I have been wiping over my cotton and nylon socks. Am I required to perform salaat al-qada for all the fard prayers in my life in which I achieved tahara through performing wudu that included mash over modern socks?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSince Wudhu is a condition for Salaat and your Wudhu was invalid, your\nSalaat will have to be repeated. You will have to perform Qadhaa for all\nprayers performed by making Masah over the cotton/nylon socks.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
