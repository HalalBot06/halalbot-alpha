  "question": "Modernistic opinion is not to believe in Jinns. Please give valid proof for proving they a separate creation of Allah (swt)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJinns are a creation of Allah. He says in the Quran, 'And I have not created\nthe jinns and man but that they worship Me'. In the @9th juz of the Quran in\nSurah Jinn, Allah Ta'ala discusses the incident of the jinns bringing iman on\nAllah. Not being able to see jinns is not a proof of non-existence just as\nthe existence of U.F.O. (unidentified flying object) cannot be outruled.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
