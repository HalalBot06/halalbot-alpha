  "answer": "QUESTION\nNewspapers and magazines lying around the house with pictures. Must they be put away at night before sleeping. Also covering of food. Explain in detail please. Shukran\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said that, 'The\nMalaaikah do not enter into those homes wherein there are dogs and pictures\n(of animate objects).' (Mishkaat pg.385). In the light of this Hadith, we\nunderstand that animate pictures should not be kept in the house, hence,\nnewspapers and magazines should be removed from the house after being used.\n2. In a portion of a lengthy Hadith narrated on the authority of Hadhrat\nJibraaeel (Alayhis salaam), Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) reported to\nhave said, 'When nightfall sets in, then cover your utensils whilst taking\nthe name of Allah Ta'ala even though you may have to place something across\nit.' (Mishkaat pg.372)\nWe understand from the above Hadith that if utensils are not entirely\ncovered but something is placed across them, together with taking the name\nof Allah Ta'ala, it will suffice. (Mirqaat vol.8 pg.230; Pakitan)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best <"
