  "answer": "QUESTION\nbecome alims and teach people and some are soofis and some are mujahideen doing jihad e.t.c. so my queastion is what should a muslim do in this corrupted age their is so many different paths people are doing some doing dawah some ilm some jihad how did you know becoming a mufti and helping others what the right way?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta?ala created every person with different temperaments and capabilities. Some are inclined towards learning and teaching while others are inclined to helping the poor and orphans. The different faculties of Deen may be likened to many different rivers leading to the same sea. The sea that all the different faculties of Deen lead to is Almighty Allah Ta?ala.\n\nTherefore, all the different faculties of Deen, be it Tabligh, learning or teaching, Soofis, etc. All have one goal and object. That is to gain the Ridhwaan (pleasure) of Allah. Whatever capabilities Allah has placed within you, for whichever field of Deen, you should give your fullest in that field of Deen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
