  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nmy mother passedaway, she had some saving certificates in her name which my father who was serving in a bank as an executive made for her, both my parents passedaway, after their death , me and my brother cash these certificates and share the cash obtain from these certificates, my question is , is it halal to use that money ? if not than how we should spendit? Question no 2. Imam leading the prayers , after ruku what imam has to read \"SAMAYALLAHULAMINHAMIDA OR\n\nRAbanaLAkalHAMID OR BOTH?\n\nTableequi brothers said , without tableeq no one will enter jannah? I am offering 5 times salat. try to follow sunnah, try to abstain from sin,, and still iam not going to jannah why? explain?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. If the certificate represents the money saved in the bank, then that money will be part of your mother’s estate and should be distributed according to the Shari’ah laws of inheritance and succession. If there are other members of the family besides your brother and yourself, for example, your mother was survived by her other children or both or one of her parents, they too will inherit from her estate.\n\n2. The effort of Tabligh is an effective way of reforming oneself. We always stated that and encourage people to join the efforts of Tabligh. However, the statement that only Tablighis will enter Jannah is incorrect. People engaged in Tabligh should not make such statements as it is to the detriment of the noble work of Tabligh.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
