  "question": "1. Is it permissible for a female to wear the normal purdah (face covering) while in Ihraam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Is it permissible for a female to wear the normal purdah (face covering) while in Ihraam? 2. Can one use vaseline in Ihraam, and if so, which type? Due to skin irritation, a person scratches his face under his beard. This sometimes results in hair falling. If this is done while in Ihraam, and some hair falls off, what should one do? 4. If hair falls of the beard as a result of stroking the beard while in Ihraam, what should one do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. A female in Ihraam may wear her Purdah in such a manner that it does not touch the face. This may be done by wearing a cap type headgear that will stop the Purdah from going on to the face.\n\n2. It is permissible to use scentless vaselines in Ihraam.\n\n3. Scratching or stroking resulting in the hair falling does not constitute Dam (penalty). However, if intentionally a person plucked his beard, Damm will not become necessary, but one should give Sadaqah.
