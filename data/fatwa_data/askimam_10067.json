  "question": "2 months back I underwent an operation for hysterolaparoscopy, since then my bleeding duration started lasting for 9 days, I took the ghusl on 10th or 11th day in my last period (1st mense)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy periods were normal, the duration of the cycle is 28 days. Normally I use to bleed for 3 to 4 days & take the ghusl on 5th day. 2 months back I underwent an operation for hysterolaparoscopy, since then my bleeding duration started lasting for 9 days, I took the ghusl on 10th or 11th day in my last period (1st mense). Now again today it is my 9th day of bleeding (2nd mense). I dont want to miss my Ramzan fasts and prayers. Pl advise me immediately when to start fasting?... I am in need of your answer very urgently.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf you stop bleeding on the 9th day or the 10th day, take a bath and start\nwith your Salaat, etc. If you bleed for more than ten days, you will revert\nto your normal habit of 9 days.\n\nIn other words, assuming you bled for eleven days, the first nine will be\nregarded as menses whilst the remaining two will be regarded as Istihaadha.\nYou will have to fast and perform Salat in these two days as well. If you\nbleed for ten days only, the entire ten days will be regarded as your new\nhabit for menses.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
