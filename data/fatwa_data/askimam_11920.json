  "question": "Is there a Hadith that suggests using the right hand when serving food into oneâ€™s plate from a dish even while eating?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nGenerally the people of the Tablighi Jamaat use their right hand for this purpose during any meal, and by the end of the meal, all the spoon handles get quite messy and sticky, which most other people at the meal don?t want to touch anymore. Were spoons used to serve at the time of the Prophet s.a.w.s.? What is the correct serving method? From my understanding most food was dry back then, and not like the Indo-Pak curries that need to be served with spoons.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAbu Hurayra [radhiallaahu anhu] narrates that Nabi [Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam] said, ?A person whould eat with his right hand, he should drink with his right hand, he should take with his right hand and he should give with his right hand.?\n\nNabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] then mentioned that Shaytan does all these actions with his left hand. (ibn Majah Hadith3266)\n\nThus, a person should take the spoon in his right hand when dishing out. However, in order to avoid messing the spoon, they should lick or wipe their fingers if they are messy before using the spoon. Fatty and oily foods were also eaten in that time as indicated by a Hadith in Sahih Bukhari, amongst others.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
