  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\ncan you please let me know if you are finding something difficult in life can you cry about it in front of Allah in dua?  I heard you shouldnt cry in difficult times.  But i'm really upset about somethings and in my dua i cry to Allah.  is this ok or should i refrain from crying in my duas when thinking about the difficult things in my life. Jazakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nAllah answers the supplications of the distressed, as He Himself states:\n\n \n\nأَمَّن يُجِيبُ الْمُضْطَرَّ إِذَا دَعَاهُ وَيَكْشِفُ السُّوءَ وَيَجْعَلُكُمْ خُلَفَاءَ الْأَرْضِ أَإِلَـٰهٌ مَّعَ اللَّهِ قَلِيلًا مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ\n\n“Is not He who responds to the distressed one when he calls on Him, and Who removes the evil and make you inheritors of the earth, generations after generations? Is there any god with Allah? Little is that you remember!” Surah Naml (27:62)\n\n \n\nNaturally, in a state of distress tears will flow as the believer understands that nothing is in his control. The believer makes his supplications and pours his heart out then resigns himself to the decree of Allah with patience and contentment.\n\n \n\nExamples of the supplications of Prophet Yusuf (alayhis salaam), Prophet Ayub (alayhis salaam), and Prophet Muhammad (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) are sufficient examples for us to follow.\n\n \n\nImam Ibn Jawzi (rahmatullahi alayhi) writes: “Shakwah (complaint) falls into two categories: The first type means to complain to Allâh, and this does not contradict patience. It is demonstrated by several of the Prophets, for example, when Yaqub (alayhis salaam) said: “I only complain of my distraction and anguish to Allâh.” (Yusuf 12:86). Earlier, Yaqub (alayhis salaam) had said “sabrun jamîl,” which means “patience is most fitting for me.” The Quran also tells us about Ayyub (alayhis salaam): “And (remember) Ayyub, when he cried to his Lord, ‘Truly distress has seized me...’ ” (Al-Anbiya 21:83). The epitome of patience, the Prophet (salallhu alayhi wa sallam), prayed to his Lord: “O Allâh, I complain to You of my weakness and helplessness.”1\n\n \n\nThroughout the above examples, the complaints are addressed to Allah and not spread to others. That is what defines patience – to turn to Allah at all times, and to resign oneself to His decree and decision – no matter the outcome.\n\n \n\nIn a hadith from Sayyidina Abu Hurairah, the Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) is reported to have said: من بث لم يصبر , that is one who goes about narrating his distress before everyone has not observed Sabr.2\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl.
