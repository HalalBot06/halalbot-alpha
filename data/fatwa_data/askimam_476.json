  "answer": "QUESTION\nSir, as I said above I want to marry a Christian girl and she will accept Islam But my parentsare not giving me the permission. As you know Allah has annouced a great reward of this byt my parentsare simply opposing this marriage because they think they will loose there dignity in the societyWhat should I do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for Muslim male to marry a Christian or Jewish female.%0D%0AHereunder is our reply to a similar question:%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is not permissible for a Muslim female to marry a non-Muslim male.%0D%0AHowever, a Muslim male may marry only Christian or Jewish female. It is not%0D%0Apermissible for a Muslim male to marry any other non-Muslim female.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe reason it is permissible for the Muslim male to marry a non-Muslim%0D%0Afemale is that he would be able to easily convince the Christian or Jewish%0D%0Awife into accepting Islam. There is a possibility of the non-Muslim male%0D%0Aconvincing his Muslim wife into abandoning Islam. Therefore, Islam has%0D%0Aconsidered her feminine nature and protected her correct beliefs from being%0D%0Aa victim of abuse from the male dominance.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Muslim husband is not obliged to pressurise his Christian%2FJewish wife to%0D%0Aaccept Islam. He may apply wisdom and diplomacy and only influence her to%0D%0AIslam. In Islam, a female is equally respected as a male, however, due to%0D%0Athe different masculine and feminine natures, Islam believes in separation%0D%0Aof roles. It is obvious that there are many things a male can do, which is%0D%0Anot easily possible for a female and vice versa.%0D%0A%0D%0ASince marriage is a big and important step in one's life, it is imperative%0D%0Ato exercise extreme precaution in choosing a partner whilst there are great%0D%0Arewards installed for a person to convert another to Islam. Contextually, it%0D%0Ais equally important to consider the compatibility of his marital partner.%0D%0AFor that, Shari'ah has advised one to make Mashwara (seek guidance) of one's%0D%0Aseniors as well as make Istikhaara. Istikhaara:%0D%0Awww.jamiat.org.za%2Fisinfo%2Fistikhaara.html%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0A"
