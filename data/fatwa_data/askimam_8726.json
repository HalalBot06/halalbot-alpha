  "question": "tasbeeh fatima-e-zahra(ra). please tell me the benefits of reciting this tasbeeh ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\ncan this tasbeeh be recited to solve rizq (sustenance) problem ? how many times should I recite it to seek rizq ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTasbeeh-e-Faatima, which is reciting 33xTasbeeh (Subhaanallah), 33xTahmeed (Alhamdulillah) and 33xTakbeer (Allaahu Akbar) has many virtues.\n\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Whoever reads this Tasbeeh after Fardh Salaat, Allah will forgive all his minor sins even though they amount to the foam of the ocean.?\n\nWe are unable to locate a virtue which shows this Tasbeeh increases Rizq. For increase in Rizq, you may recite ?Allaahumma ikfiniy bihalaalika an haraamika, wa aghniniy bi fadhlika amman siwaaka.?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
