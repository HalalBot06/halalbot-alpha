  "answer": "QUESTION\nMufti Sahab I am Hafiz of Qur'aan and I been leading Taraweeh since I became a Hafiz. This past Ramadan some new Imam came to my local masjid and he wanted to lead the Taraweeh and he did I was told to find some place else and I was too late to find any other place and I was very angry. My Ramadan was not the same because of this. Since that day I feel like Allah is punishing me. I used to pray five times a day and I was very active in Tablighi Jamaat and now I don?t even feel like going to the Masjid and when I go I don?t feel right being with the new imam. I am very scared I thing I did something wrong I was thrown out of the Tabligh and the Masjid. I am worried. I need to know what?s happening. JazakAllah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nEverything occurs through the will of Allah Ta'ala and there is definitely%0D%0Asome wisdom behind every decision of Allah Ta'ala. It is our duty to accept%0D%0Athis and look forward. Instead of being despondent rather remember that,%0D%0A'there is always light at the end of the tunnel.'%0D%0A%0D%0AYou should seize this opportunity by focusing your attention towards Allah%0D%0ATa'ala and seeking his assistance in all your affairs. In a Hadith Qudsi,%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala states, 'I treat my servant according to the thought he holds%0D%0Aabout me.' We should, therefore, have strong faith in the unseen assistance%0D%0Aof Allah coming. Try and maintain your contact with the Musjid and Tabligh%0D%0Aas far as possible. Also keep up with the Taraweeh Salaat even though it be%0D%0Ain a different venue. We should seek the assistance of Allah by the 2 ways%0D%0Aprescribed in the Qur'aan, 'through patience and as-Salaat. Truly Allah Ta'%0D%0Aala is with the as-Saabiroon (the patient ones).' (Baqarah Aayat153)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe object of our actions is not any particular Imaam or Musjid. The object%0D%0Ais Allah Ta'ala. Be focused on this. Simply ignore the Shaytaan whispering%0D%0Athat Allah Ta'ala is punishing you. Have a positive thought and Allah Ta'ala%0D%0Awill treat you accordingly.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0Afor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
