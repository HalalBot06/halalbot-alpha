  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamuaikum\n\nI have recently subscribed to an islamic emailing list and have received some disturbing emails concerning Deen. i am capable of engaging these people but my knowledge is limited and i feel it would be more appropriate if Uleama like yourselves engage with them.\n\nif you could send me your email address i would forward you all the mail i receive from the group.\n\nBelow is the latest mail received: \n\n___ \n\nHere is another Hadith from Tirmidhi which I hope the enemies of Islam do not get hold of. Some verses from the Quran to ponder over.\n\n\n\n\nNarrated Aisha\nHadith Number 1220\nZayd ibn Harithah came to Medina when Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) was in my house. When he came to him and knocked at the door Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) got up and went to him naked, trailing his garment. I swear by Allah that neither before nor after that did I ever see him naked. He then embraced him and kissed him.\n\n\n Tirmidhi transmitted it.\n\n\n (We must start following this Sunnah-hope Sherry Jones does not get hold of this one)\n\n\n   Explanation of the Quran is in the Quran itself\n\n “Those who hide the proofs and the guidance which We revealed, after We had made it clear in the Book: such are accursed of Allah and accursed of those who have the power to curse.”2/159\n\n\n   Quran is its own Shar’a (Islamic law as postulated in the Quran itself)\n\n\n“He has ordained the Shari’a for you through the Deen which He commended to Nooh, and that which We inspire in you ( Muhammad ), and that which We commended to Ibrahim and Moosa and Isa……”42/13\n\nTo seek Shari’a outside of Quran is Shirk (as some believe that Hadith is part of Shari’a)\n\n”Is it that they believe in forces other than the Shari’a of Allah, which enjoin upon them that which Allah has not given permission for…..”42/21\n\n“Hadith” in the Quran. (Some examples of the word Hadith as it is used in the Quran)\n\nChapter 4 Verse140. “He hath already revealed unto you in the Scripture that, when ye hear the revelations of Allah rejected and derided, (ye) sit not with them (who disbelieve and mock) until they engage in some other conversation (Hadith). Lo ! in that case (if ye stayed) ye would be like unto them. Lo! Allah will gather hypocrites and disbelievers, all together, into hell;”\n\nChapter 6 Verse 68: “ And when thou seest those who meddle with Our revelations, withdraw from them until they meddle with another topic (Hadith). And if the devil cause thee to forget, sit not, after the remembrance, with the congregation of wrong doers.”\n\nChapter 45 Verse 6: “These are the portents of Allah which We recite unto thee ( Muhammad ) with truth. Then in what report (Hadith), after Allah and His portents, will they believe?”\n\nChapter 52 Verse 34: “Then let them produce speech (Hadith) the like thereof, if they are truthful”\n\nChapter 56 Verse 80, 81 :”A revelation from the Lord of the Worlds. Is it this Statement (Hadith) that ye scorn”\n\nIncidentally here are some dates that will help to put Ahadith in its proper perspective.\n\n* IMAM BUKHARIR: He was born in Bukhari in hijra 196-256 and some believe the date to be hijra 260 but we all know that he died in Samarkand . It is said that after wandering through different cities and villages he collected close to six hundred thousand hadiths and after sifting through he found 7,300 ahadith that he considered close to being authentic. Some have been repeated in various chapters. If we do not count the repetitions, the total figures we get are 2,630 or 2,762.\n\n* IMAM MUSLIMR: Muslim bin Hajaj belonged to a city in called Nishapur. He was born in hijra 204 and died in hijra 261.\n\n* TRIMZI: Imam Abu Isa Muhammad Trimzi was from the city called Trimz in . He was born in hijra 209 and died in hijra 279.\n\n* ABU DAWOOD: He comes from Seestan in . He was born in hijra 202 and died in hijra 275.\n\n* IBNE MAJA: Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Zaid ibne Maja came from northern , a city that goes by the name of Kazdin. His year of birth is hijra 209 and he died in hijra 273.\n\n* IMAM NISAAYEE: Imam Abdur Rahman Nisaayee came from a city called Nisa in 's eastern province of Khorasan . He died in hijra 303.\n\nIt would not be futile to know the number of ahadith that have been discredited.\n\nImam BukhariR repetitions & dishonouring others from 600,000: 2,762\nImam MuslimR after dishonouring from the collection of 300,000: 4,348\nTrimzi after dishonouring from the collection of 300,000: 3,115\nAbu Dawood after dishonouring from 500,000: 4,800\nIbne Maja after dishonouring from 400,000: 4,000\nNisayee after dishonouring from 1,000,000: 4,321\n\nOne must understand the perseverance, effort and sacrifice that these great scholars of Islam put into the collection of the above 2.1 million ahadith. History tells us that Imam Bukhari only discarded ahadith after making Istaghara Salah (Namaaz) and if one calculates that each Salah could have taken him 10 minutes (30,000 per year/2500 per month/ 83 per day), and that he started collecting, say, at the age of twenty, how and when did he find time for other things as he was a business man (it might be interesting for the readers to investigate the business he was in-this is your homework). He also traveled throughout the then Muslim Empire to question and investigate the characters of the reporters-wow. He stopped collecting ahadith 24 years before his demise and spent this time traveling and teaching ahadith in different centres of the then Muslim empire. This really was some sacrifice.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe clash between truth and falsehood commenced from the inception of mankind between Nabi Adam على نبينا وعليه الصلوة و السلام and shaitan. This continued in every era and time throughout history as shaitan promised not to leave any stone untouched in his effort of misguiding the progeny of Adam على نبينا وعليه الصلوة و السلام. Shaitan and his agents only object is to oppose the truth. This effort continued even in the time of Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم and continues right up till today. However, Allah Ta’ala through His infinite grace and mercy sent His chosen servant to rebut falsehood. Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم is the seal of all prophets and there is no prophet to come after Him. Allah Ta’ala has chosen the learned scholars of His ummah to continue the rebuttal of falsehood. Therefore, it is now the responsibility of the ulama to rebut any objections and accusations made against Allah Ta’ala and Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم and it remains the responsibility of the general public not to follow anyone but the true upholders of the Quran and Sunnah. Allah Ta’ala says in the Noble Quran:\n\nوإذا رأيت الذين يخوضون في آياتنا فأعرض عنهم حتى يخوضوا في حديث غيره وإما ينسينك الشيطان فلا تقعد بعد الذكرى مع القوم الظالمين (الانعام 68)\n\n“And when you see those who delving in Our Ayat, then turn away from them until they delve in some other discussion. And if shaitan causes you to forget then after the reminder don’t sit with the oppressors.”(al-Anam 68)\n\nThe Darul Ifta will be taking limited queries in Ramadhan. You may forward the e-mail in reference after Ramadhan.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Ishaq E.
