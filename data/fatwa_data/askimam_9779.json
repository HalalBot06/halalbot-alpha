  "question": "I had a dream a boy that i like at school was kissing my friend what does this dream mean please tell me because i am really scared that i might lose him.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to our understanding, you are a female. If our understanding is\ncorrect, then we wish to point out that it is Haraam (strictly prohibited)\nfor a girl to have a boyfriend.\n\nThe feeling and inclination towards the boy in reference is against Islamic\nvalues of shame and modesty. You should guard yourself against such evils,\nor else you will become the playground for the Shaytaan, who will whisper\nevil dreams in you as you have seen and instil fear in you as you are\nexperiencing.\n\nSister, keep your heart, mind and soul clear from all such evils. The love\nand recognition of Allah followed by peace and contentment enters into pure\nsouls and hearts.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
