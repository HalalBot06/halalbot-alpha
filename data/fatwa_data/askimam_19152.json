  "question": "Children leading Salaah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a question which is for Salāh. There is an Islamic school here and they teach kids (boys and girls) how to pray Salāh. One kid stands in front as the Imām and the other children stand behind him as Muqtadis. One lady teacher stands beside them and she gives instructions to them like: takbīr, qirā'ah, rukū, sujūd, etc. The kids follow her in actions only. Sometimes she also has them practice Fardh Salāh like Dhuhr. My question is: Is this practice valid or not for Fardh Salāh?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nYes, it is permissible for the teacher to have her students perform Salāh in this manner, while giving them instructions.\n\nThese children are presumably small and have not reached the age of maturity. Therefore, Salāh is not Fardh (obligatory) on them. They are essentially practicing Salāh by praying in congregation with the help of their teacher so that when it does become Fardh (obligatory) on them, they will be able to perform it correctly.\n\nWhile this is an effective teaching method for younger children, it is neither suitable nor recommended for older children (10 and above) since the importance of Salāh requires that they be given such instruction outside of Salāh.
