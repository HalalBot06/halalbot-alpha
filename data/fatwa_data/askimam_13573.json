  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI know that it is compoulsary for a wome to cover her hair and her body, and i though that the face was wajib but i read some where that  a women may show her \"face\", hands and feet. Can you please clarify this matter.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Just as it is necessary for her to conceal her entire body, she is compelled to cover her face as well when going out of the house. The issue of leaving the face, etc. open refers to Satr is Salaat. She should cover her entire body when performing Salaat but she may leave the face, hands and feet exposed. The exposure of the face refers to Satr is Salaat. She should cover her entire body when performing Salaat but she may leave the face, hands and feet exposed. The exposure of the face refers to Satr in Salaat only and not to Hijaab. There is a difference between Hijaab and Satr in Salaat.\n\n2. Exposing the face, which is the very centre of her beauty and attraction, whilst concealing the rest of her body whilst venturing out of the home does not make much common sense.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
