I never shared it with anyone. please help me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram Sister in Islam\n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\n \n\nThere are two issues.  One is your father.  The other is his wrong act and deed.  In order for us to be fair and balanced, it is important that we separate the issues.  Follow the principle, hate the wrong, not the person.  It is human nature to err and do wrong.  No human being is an angel.  Only the prophets of Allah are sinless.  It is part of ones Ieman and faith to resent wrong deeds.  It is also part of ones faith and Imaan to overlook the shortcomings of others.  To respect ones father is fardh.  It is an express order of Allah in the Quran.  If ones parents are non-muslims and are engaged in the filth of kufr and shirk, a muslim is still required to show and express respect to his parents.  He/She will hate the kufr and disbelief of ones parents but that should not lead one to hate or resent or disrespect ones parents.  In the same light, you should overlook the shortcoming of your father and fulfill your duty of showing respect to him. If Allah grants your father the tawfeeq to seek forgiveness and Allah loves that, then your father will be forgiven and also beloved by Allah.  Whatever your father did, it is between him and Allah.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\nThe guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\nEducation and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\nIslam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\nWhen one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\nMuslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\nWe have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\nIf you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\nIf that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\nRasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit”.\n\n \n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
