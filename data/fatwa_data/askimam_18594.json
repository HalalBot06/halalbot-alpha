  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThe brelvis are approving Milad by the following event  which happened in Chakwal, my question is:\n 1-Can Prophet (peace be upon him) come to a persons house & leave a foot print or can Allah taala leave a foot print of Prophet (peace be upon him),   if not then what could be the light which came and also the foot print?\n2-Is the story real?\n3- What answer should be given to those who are influenced because of this ?\n\n  A brelvi mentions: the reason why this happened was because, there was a family who was quite poor and a man's daughters said they want to celebrate eid milad un nabi and they said \"what we gonna do if theres so many people?\" and then all of a sudden there was soo much light and allah t'allah stamped the prophet foot there mashallah? beautiful! so it is a miracle!\n\nMore Information on youtube.com\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EjUOlQsd-8&feature=related\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2mqIKSz6o4&feature=related\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFPURfaqfLc&feature=related\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANx_hrdVfyQ&feature=related\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\n1,2) The Barelwis believe that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is Haazir and Naazir i.e. omnipresent and omniscient. However, this belief is not correct, as it is against the teachings of the Quran and the Hadith. Only Allah Ta’ala has total and perfect knowledge of everything.\n\n \n\n‘He is Allah besides Whom there is no god; the Knower of the unseen and the seen’ (Quran 59:22)\n\n \n\nIf Rasulullah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is present everywhere and he knows everything, then why did Rasulullah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) need to search for the necklace of Aisha (Radiyallahu Anhaa) that she lost in one of the journeys? If Rasulullah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) had knowledge of the unseen, he would have known that the necklace was under the camel of Aisha (Radiyallau Anhaa) and there would have been no need for Rasulullah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) and the Sahabah to camp at that place overnight. (See: Bukhari, hadith 322)\n\n \n\nIf Rasulullah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is present everywhere and he sees and knows everything, then on the day of judgement why will it be said to him “You do not know what they had done after you.”? (See: Bukhari, hadith 4259)\n\n \n\nThe above are only a few of the many, many evidences that clearly demonstrate that the belief of the Barelwis in regards to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) being omnipresent and omniscient is a deviant belief and a belief that is alien to the teachings of Islam.\n\n \n\nObviously, the Barelwis cannot substantiate their beliefs and actions with the Quran and the Hadith; therefore they try to justify their beliefs and actions to themselves as well as to the others by deceptive methods.\n\n \n\nThe event in Chakwal, Pakistan is one of those deceptive methods.\n\n \n\nWaqt News has interviewed the neighbours, friends and relatives of the person, Tanweer Attaari, who made the claim and has exposed the lie, treachery and deceit involved in the whole affair. After all, where did Tanweer Attaari ever learn that the blessed footwear of the beloved Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) was 6 feet by 2 and half feet (1.8 metres by 76 cm) in size? And why only one shoe? Did not the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) himself prohibit others from walking only on one shoe? (See: Sahih Muslim hadith 3919)\n\n \n\nWaqt News discovered that prior to the mark on the ground, halwa was cooked in a pot on the same spot on the ground for someone’s wedding. Ironically, another person in the same neighbourhood had also cooked halwa for someone else’s wedding on the ground in a pot at his place and amazingly the same kind of mark was found where the halwa was cooked. Just a coincidence? Or, in both cases, was the mark formed due to the heat of the flame and the pots and the recent rainfall in the area after a long period of draught?\n\n \n\nAs for the light that emerged from the mark: who actually saw the light? Tanweer Attaari’s neighbour and friend, Akbar Khan, who came to look at the phenomenon in the initial stages, did not see any light whatsoever.\n\n \n\n3) Tell them that supernatural events alone are not reliable indicators of correct beliefs and actions if the beliefs and actions cannot be backed up by the Quran, the Sunnah and by the beliefs and actions of the pious predecessors such as the Sahabah, the Tabi’een and the Tab’ Tabi’een. Otherwise, the Christians, the Hindus etc also claim that they have supernatural events to prove their beliefs and actions. Will one accept their beliefs and actions merely due to some supernatural events that may have taken place that they have construed to support their beliefs and actions?\n\n \n\nThis is especially more so the case because of the distinct possibility of deceit, trickery and treachery being involved in the ‘supernatural event’, as was the case in the event that happened in Chakwal.\n\n \n\nWe ask Allah Ta’ala to keep us on the straight path, the path of the pious predecessors, and to protect us from the tricks of Shaitaan, the accursed. Ameen.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n\n\nMl.
