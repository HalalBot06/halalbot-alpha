  "question": "Can we ask Allah tala for some thing by referencing nabi sallah laho wa ali he wasalm or some other pious person living or dead.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat i mean to ask is that in Indo-Pak people has a trend of visting the graves of pious persons.and ther they go mainly to ask for their duas. when we ask some on that this is wrong then they say that they just refere it throug these pious dead people to Allah. Can you please explain this practice\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour question relates to the practise of Waseela (to adopt means)%0D%0A%0D%0AWaseela is permissible. Allah Ta?ala states in the Qur?aan, ?O you who believe! Fear Allah and adopt a Waseela to Him.? Hadhrat Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) used to make Istisqaa (seek rain) through the Waseela of the uncle of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), Hadhrat Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhu).%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen a person makes a request to the king, at times, he takes the name of a person who is close to the king. The king may accede to the request, also in consideration of the person that is close to him. In Waseela, one should be making Du?aa to Allah, asking Him to fulfil his needs. One does not ask the deceased. That is incorrect and an act of disbelief. %0D%0A%0D%0AMany people have a misunderstanding of Waseela and resort to requesting their needs to the deceased in the name of Waseela. To visit the graveyard is an act of virtue, but to go there and ask the deceased to fulfil their needs is Haraam and strictly prohibited.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
