  "question": "Salaam If a child whose father is not around(divorced his mother,died,imprisoned)is worthy of recieving zakat,even if his family is well to do.Jazakumullah.Salaam.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nA certain Zakat organisation having members on the maktab board in our town claimed the above, and is prepared to sponsor the fees of such children from the zakaat fund.What is the Shar'ee ruling and what should be done? Jazaakumullah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe child may receive Zakaat if he is deserving. (Fataawa Mahmoodiya vol.2 pg.148)\n\nSince Tamleek is a condition for the fulfilment of akaat, it will not suffice if the fees are paid directly to an institution on behalf of the child. Rather, the money should first be handed over to the child, if he is of an age where he is able to understand, or else to his guardian. (Ibid vol.3 pg.88)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
