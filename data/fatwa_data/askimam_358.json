  "question": "My husband mentioned 'talaq,talaq,talaq' in an argument. He now claims that he mentioned it 2 times and mispronounced the 3rd time and he still wants me as his wife. Can i go back after iddath?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe both want this marriage. Is there any way of getting back together? We have no children.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMispronouncing the Talaaq does not invalidate the Talaaq. The third\nmispronounced Talaaq by your husband is valid.\n\nYour Nikah with him has irrevocably broken down. You cannot live together as\nhusband and wife.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
