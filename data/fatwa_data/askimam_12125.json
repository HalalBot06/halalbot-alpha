  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs there any duas i can read to strenghten my faith and my religion, i am really wanting to become more religious but im finding it so difficult to 'get into' it. i really want to practise islam fully which i am not at the moment, what can i do to strenghen this. Also what does a snake signify in a dream. I kill it in my dream what does that mean?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Hadith teaches us that the highest form of zikr is Laa ilaha illal lahu. Repeat this excessively, day and night, at every available moment. Insha-Allah, you will gradually notice the wonderful effect of excessive zikr.\n\nWhile there are many Duas which are very efficacious, the essence of Dua is to ask Allah Ta?ala from the heart. Make Dua to Allah Ta?ala regularly, and pour out your heart to Him. This should be done with consistency.\n\nPracticing on Deen requires courage and determination. There is no replacement for this. Therefore be brave and resolute when faced with indolence or lethargy.\n\nUnfortunately the writer is not experienced in interpreting dreams.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
