  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMazi is from among Najaasat-e-Ghalizah (severe impurities). Therefore, the\nsoiled portion of the body or clothes with Mazi must be washed before\nperforming Salaat.\n\nIf the Mazi on the body or clothes is more than the hollow of one's palm,\nthe Salaat will be invalid. If it is lesser than that, it will be Makrooh\n(disliked).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
