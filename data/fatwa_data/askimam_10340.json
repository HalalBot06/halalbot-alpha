  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it true that Prophet Muhammed (peace be upon him) ordered the deaths of 'innocent people' from Bani Qurayzah? Could you plz narrate the incident regarding the Bani Qurayzah's being punished for their betrayal of the Muslims? How many Jews were killed? Were those who were killed innocent people, and if they were then how can this be reconciled with the fact that we're not allowed to kill innocent people in Islam? I've heard that all their men were killed. If so, is this fair considering the fact that not every man must've agreed to betraying the Muslims? Did the Bani Qurayzah accept the punishment, willingly, which was implemented? Plz provide all the details for non-Muslims keep attacking Nabi (peace be upon him) on this point. Jazaakum Allah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere was a peace treaty between the Banu Qurayza and the Muslims. When the%0D%0AQuraysh went to attack Madinah Munawwarah, the Banu Qurayza broke the peace%0D%0Atreaty and joined the Quraysh. When Allah Ta'ala gave victory to the Muslims%0D%0Ain the battle of Khandaq, the Banu Qurayza went in their forts. Angel%0D%0AJibraaeel came to the Prophet [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and said that%0D%0AAllah had ordered you to go to Banu Qurayza. The angels had not yet taken%0D%0Aoff their armour because they were going to help the Muslims.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen the prophet [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] went to Banu Qurayza, they%0D%0Asurrounded their forts for 25 days. During these 25 days, Ka'ab ibn Asad%0D%0Agathered the people of Banu Qurayza and said to them that to gain victory%0D%0Afrom the Muslims, we will have to accept one choice from the three we have.%0D%0AKa'ab ibn Ansari said the first choice is that we bring faith in the prophet%0D%0A[sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and his religion religion and become his%0D%0Afollowers, but the people rejected this.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe second option is that you kill your kids and women and then you fight%0D%0Auntil you die. The Banu Qurayza did not accept this choice. The third option%0D%0Ais that on a Saturday, we attack the Muslims. The Jews are not allowed to%0D%0Afight on a Saturday, so if they attack the Muslims it would be unexpected%0D%0Aand there is a possibility for the Jews to win. However, the Banu Qurayza%0D%0Arejected this. Afterwards, the Jews agreed upon whatever the prophet%0D%0A[sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] says we will agree to it. The prophet%0D%0A[sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said to them that that 'are you not satisfied%0D%0Aif this matter is handed over to someone amongst you?' The Jews agreed to%0D%0Athis and the prophet [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said that is Sa'ad ibn Mu%0D%0A'aadh was handed over this matter and all the Jews agreed to it.%0D%0A%0D%0ASa'ad ibn Mu'aadh said that all the young and strong men shall be killed%0D%0Awhereas the sick and the old, women and the children shall be made slaves.%0D%0AThis was the incident which took place regarding the Banu Qurayza.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
