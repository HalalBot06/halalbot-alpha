  "question": "Based on the Hadith, if one uses the intercession of their good deeds, does this result in the good deed getting “used-up”? Or do we still get the due reward for the good deed in the Hereafter?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOne may make his good deeds as intercession many times.\n\nIt does not mean that if a person used his good deeds as intercession or as\na means of trying to fulfil some worldly need, then it gets 'used up' and\nthe good deeds no more stands in credit for him. He will definitely be\nrewarded for that good deed in the hereafter, in fact, he may even use the\nintercession of those very same good deeds for several other worldly needs\nas well.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
