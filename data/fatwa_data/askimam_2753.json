  "question": "Salat valid for females wearing long sleeves to cover wrists, but when in Sijdah a portion above the wrists show? Also, In our town there are many Azaans all at once.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)Females in salaat. Wearing long sleeves to cover wrists, but when in Sijdah a portion above the wrists show. Is salaah invalid? 2) In our town there are many Azaans all at once. Should we wait for all the azaans to be over before praying. Sometimes we cannot hear the azaan properly. 3) I have read that in every sijdah after Subhana Rabbi al Ala, one can read 3x Ya Rabbi Ighfirli. (ie fard sunnah or nafl salaah). Is this alright? 4) If after a shower (not ghusl) is one allowed to make wudhu for salaat at the same time (ie without one's clothing on)?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If a quarter of any limb that was to be covered when offering Salaat is\nexposed to the extent of being able to recite Subhaanallah 3 times, the\nSalaat will be invalidated.\n2. A person should answer and comply with the Adhaan of his or her Musjid,\ni.e. the Musjid nearest to one's house. There is no need to wait for all the\nAdhaans to finish.\n3. The Du'aa Allaahumma ighfir liy may be read in the Jalsa position, that\nis between the two Sajdahs.\n4. The Wudhu performed in the shower will be valid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
