  "question": "I am 22 years old. Basically all throughout my life, I've done no good. To me life was just about having fun. I've done so much wrong. But two years ago I decided to change all that",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI started to pray, read Qur'an, to perfect so much more and myself. But still I'm not satisfied with myself.I'm afraid of only one thing and that is 'DEATH'.I'm not afraid of dieing, as I know that is something we all will experience, but I'm afraid of that time when I die only to know that hell will be my destiny. I know there's no turning back, no changing anything. For the last couple of days, I've studied Islam very carefully & have learned a lot. Believe me, I try to do a lot of good now. But when I die what if Allah sends me to Hell. I' am terrified. I think too much about what will happen to me after death. I ask myself, \"What if I won't be able to answer the questions of those two interrogating angels, what if my grave starts to get tighter\" & so on. I wish I could do that ONE particular thing so special in the eyes of Allah that He will send me straight to Heaven. But what is it exactly I don't know. I don't want to burn in Hell for the rest of my Hereafter especially when I know that I've changed and that I do so much good now. But it scares me too much. Because Allah can do anything He wills. Please help; I don't know what to do, as this is something that bothers me from time to time & it becomes distressing.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlhamdulillah, your repentance and turning to Allah has made you conscious\nabout the Aakhirat. Not many people are given such a gift.\n\nIt seems that you are reading a lot of material on the Aakhirah which is\nmaking you think in this way. Remember Allah does not only punish but Allah\nis Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful. You need to concentrate on your Salaat,\nDhikr and Amal al-Khayr and if you adhere to this you would notice that\nAllah Ta'ala will put that Sakeenah in your heart and remove all that\ndistress. Also you need to keep in mind that do not judge yourself, this\nmust be left to Allah. Ensure that you continue to strive in the path of\nAllah. Allah Ta'ala says in the noble Qur'aan, 'Is not by the remembrance of\nAllah that you will have satisfaction.' The rememberance of Allah is both by\nword and deed.\n\nMay Allah Ta'ala remove all our sorrows and distresses from our hearts.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMuf"
