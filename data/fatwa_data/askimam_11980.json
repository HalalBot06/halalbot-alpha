  "question": "Question about consuming doubtful Chicken in a European Country...Halal is stated on the cartons of these chickens. 'Is it ok to believe the Muslim shop keeper and consume the chicken'.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe live in Graz, Austria. The Turkish brother own shops where they sell chicken that they say is Halal. This chicken is imported from Holland. Although the shop keeper himself does not know the procedure how these chickens are slaughtered however they say that there are Turkish companies in Holland which export Halal chicken to Austria. Halal is also stated on the cartons of these chickens. My question is 'Is it ok to believe the Muslim shop keeper and consume the chicken'.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe term Halaal on the chicken cartons is not sufficient to determine the chickens being Halal. It is important to enquire and verify how the chickens are slaughtered in Holland.\n\nUntil that is not done, it is not proper for the shopkeeper to keep such chicken and sell such chickens. The public should be made aware and avoid purchasing such chickens.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
