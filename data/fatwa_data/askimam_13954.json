  "question": "there are some mosques which only make 1 Azan and then start the Friday khutba. This means that they do not make the 1st Azan",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) Here in Ottawa, Canada, there are some mosques which only make 1 Azan and then start the Friday khutba. This means that they do not make the 1st Azan and give time for praying the 4 Sunnah. I know the 1st Azan is not part of the prayer and the Friday prayer is valid with just the 2nd Azan and then Khutba ( I asked this from some other scholars). What I wanted to know is , is it ok for me to pray the 4 sunnah as soon as the time for Zuhr/Jummah enters (before the Azan they give)???\n\n2) I have heard from a knowledgeable scholar that while in Salat, if we accidentally read something else written somewhere (e.g. something written  on the clothes of a person), the Salat is Faasid and probably you have to make it up again. Now, you might know that people wear different types of  clothes on which something might be written (I myself wear clothes like  these). If I am doing Salam at the end of Salat, and my gaze goes to one of  these writings and I accidentally read it, will I have to repeat my Salat?? Because sometimes, it is purely by accident.\n\n3) I have heard from somebody that you should always wash your new clothes\nbefore wearing them for the first time as your Salat will not be valid with\nthe new clothes because they contain some impurity??!! This to me looks like\na purely baseless belief. I have never heard something like this before. I\njust want your confirmation.\n\n4) After reading some articles of the Ulama of Deoband, I have come to the\nconclusion that the issue of Loud Dhikr and Dhikr gatherings is a\ncontroversial issue even among our own scholars. On your tasawwuf website,\n(www.almahmood.org) you have a discussion on this topic and you have said\nthat as long as nobody considers it compulsory to attend these gatherings,\nits ok. Similarly, I read a detailed article by Maulana Abdul Hafiz Makki\nand he also gave various proofs in favour of Loud Dhikr and gatherings. I\nalso read on Mufti Muhammad ibn Adam al Kawthari's website\n(www.darulifta.com) that Dhikr gatherings were started by Maulana Muhammad\nZakarriya Kandhalwi(RA). On the other side, I saw some articles on Mufti\nAfzal Hoosen Ilyas' website which said that loud dhikr and such gatherings\nare Bid'ah. He quoted the opinion of Maulana Abdul Hayi Lakhnawi (RA). I\nalso read this same opinion on Jamiah Mahmoodiyah's website which said that\ncontemporary Salam and Mawlid gatherings are bid'ah. Naturally, after\nreading all of this, I was confused. What do you think is the preferred\nopinion amongst the scholars on this issue?? It seems to me that a strong\ndifference of opinion exists. What should we do for remaining on the 'safe'\nside??\n\n5) Continuing on with the loud dhikr issue, you have a Hadith on your\ntasawwuf website which was something like the Sahaba engaged in loud dhikr\nafter every Fardh Salah (this was taken from Bukhari). With this Hadith and\nthe issue of loud dhikr, what's the proof of saying that what the Barelwis\ndo after every Fardh Salah is Bid'ah?? You might know that they recite 'La\nIllaha Illah....' 3 times loudly and then 'Muhammad ur Rasulullah...' at the\nend, after every Fardh Salah. They also do this in chorus. The Barelwis can\nalso use the same Hadith to substantiate their actions.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. To call out the first Adhaan of Jumu’ah is also sunnah. This Adhaan should not be omitted. The possible explanation for omitting the first Adhaan is that it cannot be given over the microphone and the purpose of the Adhaan, that is alerting people of the Jumu’ah Salaat is defeated. If we go by that explanation, then the second Adhaan should also be omitted. We advise those Masaajid that omit the first Adhaan to implement the calling out of the first Adhaan even if it is not on the microphone. It is a sunnah and has been an established practise for many centuries. It is not appropriate to apply our own logic and stop the sunnah practice. Nevertheless, if one performs the sunnah before Jumu’ah immediately as the Jumu’ah time sets in, it will be valid.\n\n2. It is not permissible to verbally read anything written in Salaat. For example, if the word ‘Big’ is written on a person’s shirt, it is not permissible to read and utter the word ‘big’ in Salaat. If one merely read the word ‘big’ in the mind but do not verbally state it, then this is understanding and not reading.\n\n3. It is not necessary to wash new clothes before wearing them.\n\n4. Independent loud Dhikr is not prohibited. To do loud dhikr jointly in chorus is prohibited. Mufti Afzal Elias Saheb could be referred to this type of Dhikr. Furthermore, if one regard louds Dhikr as compulsory, that too is incorrect.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
