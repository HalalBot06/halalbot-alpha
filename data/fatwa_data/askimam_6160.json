  "question": "Could you please differentiate between a Muslim and a Mu'min",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe following Aayat of the holy Qur'aan, 'So we brought out from therein the\nMu'mineen. But we found not there any household of the Muslimeen.' (Surah51\nAayat35-36)\n\nThe commentators of Hadith mention that Imaan and Islam are the same.\nRegarding the same people, Allah uses both words, 'Mu'mineen' and 'Muslimeen'.\n\nHowever, some Ulama are of the opinion that Imaan and Islam are different.\nImaan refers to the inner belief of the heart and Islam refers to the outer\nactions of a person. The view is based on the following Aayat: 'The bedouins\nsay, 'we believe' say, 'you believe not but only say, we have only\nsurrendered for faith has not yet entered your hearts.' (Surah 44:14)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
