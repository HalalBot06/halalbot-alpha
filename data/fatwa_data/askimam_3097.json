  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta?ala says, ?And help one another in virtue and piety and do not help one another in sin and oppression.? (Maaidah 5:2). Abdullah ibn Mas%F3od (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) advised, ?Do not take a commitment (profession, business, etc.) that will involve one in acquiring the world (over religious obligations). (Mishk%E3t pg.441; Qadeemi). %0D%0A%0D%0AIn view of the above, it is permissible, in fact ideal for a person to practice a profession without him compromising his religious obligations. However, in a conflict between his professional duties and religious obligations, preference should be given to religious obligations. %0D%0A%0D%0AAs an Actuarist, if one will be advising in un-Islamic activities, for example, interest-related transactions, insurances, etc. then it is not permissible.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf one will not be advising in un-Islamic activities or advising Muslim clients to assist them to come out from un-Islamic transactions, for example, interest, etc. then it will be permissible and in fact an act of virtue. %0D%0A%0D%0AIn short, to be an Actuarist is permissible and much depends on which avenue one practices upon.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
