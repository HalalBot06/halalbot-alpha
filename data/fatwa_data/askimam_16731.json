  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is the ruling concerning the manufacturing and selling of coffins which will be utilized by non-Muslims?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is permissible to manufacture and sell coffins. The Jurists mention that there are certain instances and occasions where it will be permissible for even Muslims to be placed in coffins, as is the case of the earth being too soft. Hence, since the permissibility of its usage is established in certain instances, the manufacture and sale of it will also be consequently established. \n\n(Fatawa Mahmudiyah, vol. 9 pg. 54)\n\n \n\n(ولا بأس باتخاذ تابوت له عند الحاجة) كرخاوة الارض (الدر المختار ج 2 ص 234)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
