Nevertheless, hereunder is a standard answer on contraception.\n\n \n\nCONTRACEPTION\n\n \n\nAll forms of contraception (e.g. condoms, IUD, etc.) are permissible on condition that it is not used out of fear of poverty and also that it is consentual between husband and wife. Hazrat Abu Saeed Khudri (Radhiyallahu Anhu) reports that one person asked Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) about Azal (Coitus Interruptus). Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) replied, “When Allah Ta’ala intends creating a child, nothing can stop him”.\n\n(Mishkat, Pg.275, Qadeemi)\n\n \n\nReversible\n\n \n\nChemical - the pill which is taken orally or spermicidal jellies used locally.\n\nMechanical - use of condom (intra-uterine device).\n\nPhysical - coitus interruptus.\n\nPermanent - sterilization operation - tubal ligations - vasectomies.\n\n \n\nQuestion 1\n\n \n\nIs the Practice of contraception allowed in Islam? If so, under what circumstances?\n\n \n\nAnswer\n\n \n\nContraception is permissible on a limited scale for valid reasons considered by the Shariah to be valid. The circumstances which will permit reversible and permanent contraception differ.\n\n \n\nREVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTION\n\n \n\nAmong the reasons accepted by the Shariah as valid for practising reversible contraception are:\n\n(A) Physical weakness.\n(B) Sickness.\n(C) The wife maintaining her beauty or figure for the sake of her husband.\n(D) The couple being on a journey or in a distant land.\n(E) Adverse political conditions, e.g. children are forcibly separated from their parents as is advocated by communism; etc.\n(F) The couple decide to separate in the near future.\n(G) The wife is an immoral person.\n\n \n\nThere are valid grounds for practising reversible contraception. Poverty or the fear of poverty are not valid reasons for contraception. It is not permissible to practice contraception on account of a fear of not being able to provide for a large family. Such a fear is an attribute of non-Muslims. According to the Qur’an Shareef: 'There is not a living creature, but its sustenance is the responsibility of Allah.'\n\nSimilarly desire to curb sexual desire which may stem out of piety is not a lawful ground for contraception. If practised for any reason which is unlawful in Islam, then contraception will likewise be unlawful, e.g. for indulgence in illicit sex\n\n \n\nPERMANENT CONTRACEPTION\n\n \n\nPermanent contraception is permissible only if the woman's life is in danger or her health is seriously threatened.\n\n \n\n \n\n2.      It will be permissible for you to become the Imam for that person and you may do the same i.e. become a follower when intending to read salāt with jama’at. However, you as an Imam should make an intention in your heart of becoming an Imam even though you were performing salaat alone. In the case where you intend following someone, you should make an intention of following that person only.\n\n \n\nOne should ensure when intending to follow someone in salaat that the salaat being offered is on the same level of the one intended to be read e.g. a person may be reading qadhā salaat and one intends reading the fardh of zuhr behind this person least realising that this person is making a qadhā salaat. In this case salaat behind such a person will not be valid. Furthermore, if one is reading fajr, maghrib or esha alone and he becomes an Imam, then this person should now recite aloud as he is now reading salaat with jama’at.  Even if a person is half way through a surah and someone joins in his salaat then he will now recite aloud from the time that person joined in with him.\n\n \n\n(Bahishti Zewar, Pg.163, Zam Zam)\n\n(Bahishti Zewar, Vol.11, Pg.58, Thānwi)[1]\n\n(Raddul Muhtār, Vol.1, Pg. 460-465, HM Saeed)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl.
