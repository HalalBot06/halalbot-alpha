  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) Can we use perfumes with active ingredients as ?Alcohol Denat?? Definition is at site http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/cos-227.html. 2) Does ?Makrooh? means action done without any reward? 3) Do you endorse/can we eat Al Safa products (www.alsafa.com) which are endorsed by www.ifanca.org who claim that ?IFANCA is recognized by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety Inspection Service as well as by Rabita al-Alam al-Islami (World Muslim League), Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS), Majlis Ulema Islam Indonesia (MUI), Malaysian Prime Minister's Department-Islamic Affairs Division and several other government and non-government organizations, as a certifying agency for HALAL slaughter and HALAL products.? It?s president is David Muller, who is supposedly a known Jew. Jazakallah Khaire\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Q: Is it permissible to use a perfume, deodorant, etc. which contains alcohol, and if so, can one perform Salaat without washing it off?\nA: It is not permissible to use deodorants that contain alcohol from grapes or date extracts. Such perfumes are impure and Salaat with it is invalid. However, if the alcohol is synthetic, it is pure and permissible to use. Salaat without washing off such perfumes will be valid. Sometimes, it becomes difficult to differentiate between genuine and synthetic alcohol. Thus, to be on the safe side, one should rather prefer using deodorants and perfumes that are labelled as ?alcohol-free?, especially when such perfumes are easily available. (Mufti M Saeed Motara; Azaadville)\n\n2. Makrooh is a terminology and a category of prohibition. To commit a Makrooh act is a sin.\n\n3. We do not have any knowledge about Al-Safa products.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
