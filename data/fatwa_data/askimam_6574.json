  "answer": "QUESTION\nI found out that my own mother and my sisters, have performed magic on me and my family. Please advice what I should do? Is it ok to cut ties with them for the cause of Allah (since magic is a sin)? How should I react in this situation according to Islamic rulings?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHow do you know this? What proof if there? In Shari'ah you require witnesses\nto prove this. Do not act on mere suspicion.\n\nIf you have solid grounds to prove this, then you may lessen your\nrelationship with them. However, it is still your duty to visit them\noccasionally, and see to their needs. It will not be correct to severe all\nties with them. There is no harm if you maintain a good distance from them,\nbut at the same time, once in a while you should visit them and be kind and\npolite to them despite what they may be doing. This is a test of your Imaam,\nthat despite feeling hurt, you do what Allah Ta'ala and His Rasul\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) wants you to do.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
