  "question": "Why isn't possible for woman to have more than one husband, if she's capable of supporting them?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA woman is not permitted to have more than one husband at the same time as this is expressly prohibited.\n\nImagine the chaos if she had two husbands and they would naturally be at loggerheads with each other. They would be constantly fighting over her. Imagine if she falls pregnant, who will be the father of the child? The social problems this will cause are too numerous to mention.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
