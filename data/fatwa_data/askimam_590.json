  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it permissible to work for a Insurance firm if I only do computer work for them. I do not sell insurance. The firm sells comercial as well as private Insurance. My job is to maintain their computers. Does it matter if they have agreed to process my work Visa in USA Jazak Allah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala says, '? And do not aid in sin.' (Maaida). Insurance is prohibited as it has elements of interest and gambling. Working in such a firm will be assisting in sin.\n\nIf you are unemployed and have to support your dependants, you will be excused until you find an adequate alternative.\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
