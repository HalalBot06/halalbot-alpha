  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have been studying abroad for almost 2 years. Along with the studies i have been doing part time jobs, but i was unaware that zakat has become wajib on me and secondly i am not sure of the date i crossed the nisaab amount? I am returning to my native country after one month after completing my studies, how should i pay zakat now?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn the case mentioned by you, you should use your discretion to determine when you had the Nisaab amount in your possessions.\n\nPerhaps your bank accounts statements, utility bills, etc. would help you determine this. Once you get a rough idea of the date, you should pay the outstanding Zakaat for the respective years.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
