  "question": "1.Hanging Quran Ayats/Hadiths on wall where feet point when sleep permissible? 4. we are not supposed to sit with our feet pointing in direction of Kabba?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) Is it permissible to hang quranic ayats or hadith in the direction where feet point when sleeping, even if this direction is not in direction of Kabba? What about if in direction of room where feet may point at some point during day, eg. Sitting etc.? Are there any restrictions? 2) Is it permissible to read namaz with janimaz on carpet in front of entrance to bathroom? 3) I do not understand how a woman can have her right calf on top of her left calf in sitting position after sajdah in namaz. Can you please clarify and also list the differences women must do according to Hanifi rules? 4) Also in general, we are not supposed to sit with our feet pointing in direction of Kabba?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Firstly, the hanging of Qur?aanic verses will only be permissible if the idea is to gain Barkaat (blessings) from the same. However, hanging them merely for show is incorrect as it defeats the purpose of the Qur?aanic verses. Nonetheless, if the verses %2F frames, etc. are low in line with the feet or the level of the bed, it will be incorrect to sleep with the legs facing the verses. However, if the verses are high up, one may face the feet in that direction as this would not constitute disrespect. We suggest you don?t hang any Qur?aanic verses in the bedroom as it is a place wherein one is quite often in an indecent state.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Yes, it is permissible if the door is closed. If the door is open, it would be abominable as it is quite close to a place of Najaasat (impurity).%0D%0A%0D%0A3. She will sit on her left buttock and both her legs will be taken out on her right with one atop the other.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. It is disrespectful to sit with the feet facing the Qiblah direction.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Kadwa%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
