  "answer": "QUESTION\nWas there any reasons that Rasool Allah Sallallahu Alay Wa Sallam named his daughter Fatima us Zahra? What is the meaning of this name?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe meaning of Zahraa is 'to shine'.\n\nThis was the title of Hadhrat Faatima (Radhiallaahu Anha). There are various\nreasons as to why and how she got this title. Some say that it was because\nshe was fair and beautiful, hence, shining in complection. Some say that it\nwas because her face had a natural bloom and shine that was apparent to the\nangels in the sky, like how a star blooms and shines to the people on earth.\n(Innahaa Faatima, Dr. Abdah Yamani pg.28; Darul Qibla)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
