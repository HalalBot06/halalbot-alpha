  "question": "Can a woman give a lecture in front of audience that includes non-mahram men that can see her?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am trying to convince someone near and dear to me that a muslimah cannot give a lecture in front of non-mahram unless it is behind a screen or curtain, but then she says, \"What abouta muslim guy?\" and I tell her that a man can, while a woman can not and she responds that she doesn't believe that I am right, that if a woman can not give a speech in front of non-mahram males, then a man can't in front of non-mahram females if they aren't muslim, and even if they are, should be hijab-wearing. Am I right that a woman cannot in front of non-mahram males, but a man can in front of non-mahram females, even if they are kafir or dont wear hijab....or is she right that either both can, or both cannot?....Jazakullahu khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for a woman to expose her face in the presence of%0D%0AGhayr Mahrams.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is mentioned in the noble Qur'aan, 'They (the women) should draw veils%0D%0Aupon themselves by means of their garments.' (Surah Ahzaab).%0D%0A%0D%0AThis Aayat specifically commands the covering of the face of a woman in the%0D%0Apresence of strange men. Allah Ta'ala states, 'And remain within your homes%0D%0Aand do not go about displaying yourselves as was the custom of displayment%0D%0Aduring the time of ancient ignorance.' (Surah Ahzaab).%0D%0A%0D%0AAfter the revelation of this verse, the Muslim woman during the time of the%0D%0AProphet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) began covering their faces with veils.%0D%0AThe habit of walking with an exposed face was stopped. Without any valid%0D%0Areason no woman left her home.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Thanwi (RA) has written, 'It is certainly (Haraam) prohibited for a%0D%0Awoman to come in front of a Ghayr Mahram (strange men).' (Imdaadul Fataawa%0D%0Avol.2 pg.122)%0D%0A%0D%0AGhayr Mahram is a person with whom marriage is permissible. Allah Ta'ala%0D%0Astates, 'When you ask the wives of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Afor something, ask them from behind a curtain, in it there is excellent%0D%0Apurity for your hearts and theirs.' (Ahzaab)%0D%0A%0D%0AHere, the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) are being ordered to ask questions%0D%0Aand to speak to the pure wives of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Abehind a curtain. This is an order and command for pure souls. So, who are%0D%0Awe to consider ourselves free of this command. From this Aayaat, were learn%0D%0Athat it is not permissible for a male to give a lecture to woman without any%0D%0AHijaab (curtain, screen, etc.)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Female Voice%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala states to the beloved wives of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam), 'Do not speak in soft (alluring) tones (with men) for them, he in%0D%0Awhose heart there is a disease will lust.' (Ahzaab Aayat 33)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe female voice possesses the ability to incite passion in man. In the%0D%0Alibertine of the west, this ability is even cultivated and intensified under%0D%0Atuition. Allah Ta'ala, the Creator, being fully aware of the propensities of%0D%0Aall things He has created commands that exercise Hijaab on even their voices%0D%0Aand not speak to men. When there is a need to speak in, she should not adorn%0D%0Aher voice, may not speak in soft and alluring tones, or seductively. She%0D%0Ashould speak from behind a screen with harshness in her voice.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
