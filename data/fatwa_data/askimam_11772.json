  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy son becoming Hafez of Koran enshAllah, started 3/4 mths back. I very disappointed in atmosphere in masjid. Son was good mannered, now become rude, disobedient. Mufti Salem is bad role model. he degrades student, hits them, doesn't even return their salaam! talks rude even 2 adult. ALL parents feel this. For so learned man, WHY he do this? Is ther anyone to disciplin HIM to be better teacher & better Muslim? Where guidelines for muslim teachers? Why Chritan better teach? Should i leave my son in this masjid? Should i descourage others from sending boys to him? Must I tell child protection service? how get help for this people? i angry for my son.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe do not know Mufti Salem Saheb and we cannot comment on his behaviour. Allah has guided you to make your son a Hafiz of the Qur'aan. That is a great bounty of Allah. The Hafiz and his parents are promised great rewards from Allah. All that is due to the sacrifice in becoming a Hafiz.\n\nWe advise you contain yourselves and then approach Mufti Saheb. Discuss with him politely your son's character and attitude and request his assistance. It is not appropriate for you to report the matter to the child protection unit. It is also improper for you to discourage others from sending their children to Mufti Saheb.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
