  "question": "Is it possible for me to marry a married man? I know that he loves me even though I am 20 years younger than he. I want to do the right thing.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssalaamu Álaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nIt is permissible for a Muslim male to have the maximum of four wives simultaneously if he will be able to maintain justice and equality among all\nhis wives. If you are an unmarried Muslim female, it is permissible for the married Muslim male to marry you. However, you should exercise extreme\nprecaution as that may affect his existing marriage.\n\nAnd Allah Taãla Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
