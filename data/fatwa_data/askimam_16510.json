  "question": "He sprinkles water on those praying Salaah. Is this Bid'ah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. Sometimes at funerals in my local mosque theres a person who runs across the safs before the janaza and he sprinkles some water or athar on the namazis. Is this sunnah or bidah?\n\n2. Please tell me about the relics which are often shown of the prophet salalhu alihi waslam. ie his hair, tooth, clothing. Are they really the relics of the prophet salalhu alihi waslama or fabrications?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1)We are not in a position to issue a specific ruling on the person in question. However, in essence, giving out athar is a highly recommended and virtuous act. Therefore, if it is not regarded as compulsory, there would be no harm in giving out the athar.\n\n2) Our position on any person who claims to possess the noble items of Nabi (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) is that if he brings a sanad and proof, we  will accept that it is from Nabi (sallallahu alayhi wasallam).However, if he does not bring any proof, then we would neither accept it nor reject it. This is because of the great possibility that it is from Nabi (sallallahu alayhi wasallam). It is narrated in an authentic hadith of Muslim that Nabi (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) distributed his noble hair.\n\n     \n\nصحيح مسلم - (ج 2 / ص 947)\n\nوحدثنا ابن أبي عمر حدثنا سفيان سمعت هشام بن حسان يخبر عن ابن سيرين عن أنس بن مالك قال: لما رمى رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم الجمرة ونحر نسكه وحلق ناول الحالق شقه الأيمن فحلقه ثم دعا أبا طلحة الأنصاري فأعطاه إياه ثم ناوله الشق الأيسر فقال احلق فحلقه فأعطاه أبا طلحة فقال اقسمه بين الناس\n\n     \n\nIt is only logical that every believer would preserve the Noble hair of Nabi (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) and thereafter pass it on from generation to generation. Therefore, if anyone claims to have the hair of Nabi (sallallahu alayhi wasallam), it has a great possibility of being true.\n\nThere are many items of Nabi (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) which are in the Topkapi museum in Istanbul, .  These items were brought to by Yufuz Sultan Salem I, upon the conquest of in 1517. The jubbah of Nabi (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) is also preserved in the library of Deoband, . Indeed, fortunate is the one who is blessed with visiting these items.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
