  "question": "I like to know is zakat wajib on the interest which is Ribha. Like 401K in USA or any money that is Ribha?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI just read your answer to a question on paying zakat on 401K which is Haram. How in the world Muslim be apying zakat on the money which is haram? or Is it been declared Halal?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nInterest monies must be given to the poor and needy who are eligible to\naccept Zakaat without the intention of reward. However, interest received\nfrom government institutes, eg. post office could be used to offset\ngovernment taxes. Interest received from private banks cannot be used to\noffset taxes. It may be used to offset interest charged from the same bank.\n\nThere is no Zakaat on interest money.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
