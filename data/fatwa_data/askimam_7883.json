  "question": "Are the Ahadith quoted in the Fazaail-e-Amal 100% accurate? could you recommend some good madrasahs overseas or in the united states that teach hanbali fiqh?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\ncould you give a reference list of where all the ahaadith in the fazil-e-amal came from, i.e. which major hadith collections were they taken from? What are the Fardh, Wajib, and Sunna things in Wudu (also what breaks Wudu) and in Salat according to the hanbali madhab? could you recommend some good madrasahs overseas or in the united states that teach hanbali fiqh? are salats valid praying behind someone that innovates? Why does tablighi Dawah not condemn sufism and sufis that practise Bidah? Abu hamza has lectures posted on the internet. in his discourse on one of these he mentioned that in 1979 the saudis let the french military into Makkah. He says, 'right next to the black stone,' is there truth to this? what happened? he also says that the Ulama issued a Fatwa five days later what sort of fatwa was this? he also mentioned the hanafi ulama at one point were condemning what was happening in afghanistan(the taliban taking over and establishing shariah law) is this factual? if so who were the Ulama that went to Afganistan during this period and told the taliban that they were in the wrong for the way they were doing things? Are hamas, Hizbullah, Islamic jihad, Jamaati Islamia, Islamic army of aden, Al-Qaeda, and Ikhwanul-Muslimeen valid jihad groups? Is the crescent and the star as a representation of islam bidah? in what mazhabs is a women's voice her aurah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The Hadith in Fadhaail-e-Aamaal have been collected from numerous books of Hadith. It is practically impossible to enlist each and every one of them. However, the author, Shaykh Muhammad Zakariyya (RA) has mentioned the source of most of the Ahaadith in the Arabic text.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. We suggest that you contact an expert in the Hanbaliy Madhab for an exact ruling.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Salaat behind an innovator will be valid if one has no other option on condition that his beliefs do not lead him to Kufr. (Shaami vol. Pg.554-560)%0D%0A%0D%0A4. It is one of the principles of the Tablighi Jamat that no contradictory matters be discussed so as to maintain the unity in the Jamaat. They remain neutral in such affairs so as to accommodate people of all walks. This does not mean that they approve of it. In fact, when the time is right, they do advise against some innovations on an individual basis.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. We are unable to verify the details of that want.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. You should rather consider enquiring from the man himself as to what that Fatwa was all about and who were those Ulama.%0D%0A%0D%0A8. These are just ways of identification, they are not regarded to be a part of Deen. Hence, they cannot be called a Bid?at.%0D%0A%0D%0A9. Allah Ta?ala says in the noble Qur?aan, ?And do not be soft in speech lest he in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire.? (al-Azhab 32). Though the address if to the wives of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), but it includes all woman, hence, it would not be permissible for a woman to raise her voice unnecessarily.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
