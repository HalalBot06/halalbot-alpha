  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am from Lahore Pakistan and i have read in you previous answers that a person who die due to an impact of vehicle etc is shaheed. I want to know that my father died in a road accident in which the bus rolled over (my father was in the bus) while saving a car. Will my father also treated as shaheed. And please also tell me about the Esal-e-Sawab and best way to Esal-e-Sawab. Jazak Allah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nWe sincerely sympathize with the freek accident of your Father,may Allah protect us all!\n\n \n\nYour Father is/ will definitey be regarded as a Shaheed,may Allah grant him the highest stages in Jannah Insha Allah. (Shami 611/1 Beirut)\n\n \n\nRegarding Esaale sawab,any / all forms of acts of worship like Salah,zikr,dua,recitation of Quran shareef,charities etc will be a means of Him being rewarded tremendously in the grave & the hereafter Insha Allah. According to the words of Nabi Kareem (sallallahu alaihi wasallam),a deceased person is like a drowning person,who will hold on to every small or big item/twig to save him from drowning. Hence you & all your relatives should maximize on All forms of good deeds with the intention of Isaale Sawaab (passing on the rewards) to all Marhooms,especially your late Father.\n\n \n\nOnce Sa'ad bin Ubaadah (R.A) asked Nabi (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) regarding the best Sadaqah for his deceased Mother. Nabi (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) advised him that the Best form of Isaale sawab is providing some form of Water resource for others, viz digging of a borehole,well etc. (Abu Dawood,Nasai,Mishkaat pg.169/1 Maktaba Thanwi) .As long as benefit is derived from that water resource,all those involved will be rewarded\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl.
