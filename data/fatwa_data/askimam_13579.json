  "question": "I have heard that there is a hadeeth predicting the capture of Constantnople by Muslims",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have heard that there is a hadeeth predicting the capture of Constantnople by Muslims, which states, \"truly what a wonderful leader will her leader be [Mehmet Fatih Sultan - Allah be well-pleased with him -], and truly what a wonderful army will that army be!\"  Many history books state that Sultan Mehmet instituted a law by which any Sultan acceding to the Ottoman caliphate had to kill all of his brothers, to avoid succession battles to the throne.  Is this story true?  What have Muslim scholars and historians say about this issue?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe conquest of Constantinople has been predicted in numerous Ahaadith.\nHowever, the assumption of Mehmet Fatih Sultan being the one referred to in\nthe Hadith you quote is a bit far fetched. Reason being that this conquest\nwhich has been predicted is predicted to happen at a time close to that of\nthe appearance of Dajjaal and the descent of Sayyiduna Eesa (Alayhis salaam)\nand Mehmet Fatih Sultan passed away many year ago already. (See Sahih Muslim\nvol.2 pg.191 - 192)\n\nWe are unable to confirm the incident you have quoted.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
