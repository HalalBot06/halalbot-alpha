  "question": "A book refers a Maseehah Hadith-interest can be used to build Orphange's and the like. Please clarify this.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWill institutions eg: Hospitals, Drug & Alcohol Rehab Ctrs, Old Age homes, or disabled / mental centres fall under this rule. Unfortunately Muslims have and do accrue interest and need to dispose of this, please clarify where this can be done in the above. Jazaku-Mullah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nInterest monies must be given to the poor and needy who are eligible to\naccept Zakaat without the intention of reward. However, interest received\nfrom government institutes, eg. post office could be used to offset\ngovernment taxes. Interest received from private banks cannot be used to\noffset taxes. It may be used to offset interest charged from the same bank.\n\nInterest monies cannot be used to build institutions.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
