To eat Halaal food with non-Muslims is Makrooh. However, if a person was forced to eat with non-Muslim and he did so one or two times, he will not be sinful. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyah vol.5 pg.101)\n\n2. It is permissible to accept the invitation of a non-Muslim if there is a need to do so and the food is pure and Halaal. (Ibid vol.9 pg.369)\n\n3. If the food bought is Halaal and pure and no detriment will be caused by accepting the food, it will be permissible. (Ibid vol.5 pg.225)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
