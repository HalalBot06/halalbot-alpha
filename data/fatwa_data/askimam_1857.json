  "question": "My brother is using interest.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n.He just got married to a girl he went out with for 2 years but they only bought presents did the movie thing - nothing serious. Although my husband advised him not to deal with interest he has gone ahead and put a deposit on a house. I believe my new sister-in-law is also having an adverse affect on him although my brother has been virtually nonpractising for about 2.5 years. How can I get them to see what they are doing wrong>\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two aspects here:\nOne is I?elaam (to inform) and the other is I?emaal (to make others practice). Informing is merely a means of making others practice. The purpose (to make others practice) should be placed first and then wisdom should be applied in trying to achieve the purpose.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
