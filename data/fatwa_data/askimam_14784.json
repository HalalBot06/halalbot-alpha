  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a brother, 19 years old, who is currently held a prisoner at an immigration prison in the for over stay charges. He was initially arrested because he got involved in a fist fight with another person. The police dropped the fighting charges, but then arrested him again because he had violated his stay in the . The immigration people gave my brother the option to either apply to go home voluntarily or wait for the judge’s decision. He took the second option and he was given a bails bond for $5,000. Now, it is left for my parents to make the decision whether to pay the $5,000 dollars to bail him out or he should go back home. My father, who is back home, , wants him to come back to and my mother is saying ‘no’ let us bail him off. They both have reasons for their decisions which I will present to you now.\n\nMy father’s reasons:   \n\n \n\nHe (my brother) has given them a difficult time since he came to the\nHe has been disobedient to both parents and disrespectful\nHe is not always with a good company of people\nHe does whatever he wants\nHe is not doing well in school\nHe wants him to come to and start going to school there and work with him\nHe wants to keep an eye on him\nHe cannot afford to pay $5,000 to bail him out so he can ran off again\nHe had violated other law prior to this event\nBasically, he does not trust his stay in the anymore and he wants him back home\n\nMy mother’s reasons:\n\n \n\nShe agrees to almost all the reasons mentioned above\nShe wants to give my brother another try\nShe said what happened might be the reason for him to change\nShe disagrees with the idea of him going back home\nAllah knows best his intentions(my brother)\n\nIn conclusion, my father wants him back home due to his behavior and my mother wants him to stay, even though she agrees that he has a poor behavior. All she is saying is that he might change and Allah knows best. As at now my parents are quarrelling over this matter and it is getting me very worried because I do not know what to say. I feel very pressured right now and I need your sincere advise.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nYour brother has been disobedient in the past. He could still be disobedient when he returns home. Calling him back will not change him. There is a possibility that this incident may have an impact on him and he may reflect, ponder and change. Use this opportunity to advise him and show him love and care. Try to make your brother. If he does not get support from the family, he will become despondent. Love and compassion leaves a mark in the person. It will show sooner or later.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
