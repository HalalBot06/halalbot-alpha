  "question": "A homosexual wants to repent. How can he become inclined towards women?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am very troubled by this problem. Please advise me on how to cure myself of this sin and how to remove my sexual inclination towards men.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo cure oneself from this type of sexual pervesion the first step that you%0D%0Ahave taken already is to identify that you have this problem and it is not%0D%0Asomething that is natural and Allah has prohibited it. Refer to Sura 26%0D%0Averse 165-166 also sura 11 verses 77 -81.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou then need to make sincere Thaubah to Allah that you would not get%0D%0Ainvolved with these type of activties again. I suggest that you keep in%0D%0Acontact with an Alim who you can explain your problem to and he can guide%0D%0Ayou on a regular basis, thus helping you keep away from the problem that you%0D%0Aare faced with. Also you need to get involved in your Deen i.e. making your%0D%0Afive daily Salaah in Jamaah as Allah states in the Quraan \" Verily Salaah%0D%0Akeeps you away from evil and wrong doing...\" Also you need to recite the%0D%0AQuraan daily with the Sunnah duas%0D%0Aafter every Salaah and to keep your tongue wet with the rememberance of%0D%0AAllah all the time.%0D%0A%0D%0ANot forgetting that you got to make the effort from within you as the saying%0D%0Agoes it is mind over matter and if you put Allah before all then you not%0D%0Aonly be cured in this world but also in the Akhirah. So you need to hold on%0D%0Asteadfast to your Deen and talk about the problem and it is%0D%0Ayou that can make the change. Inshallah.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah guide and help you, Ameen%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0Afor: Shaykh Irshaad Amod %2F Moulana Imraan Vawda%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
