  "question": "Sex Toys – please clarify...Is the use of sex toys valid because the phrase “or those whom their right hand possess” applies to it, as that toy is bought and completely in possession ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI recently read at your site that use of sex toys is permissible and was a bit surprised to know the answer. Please clarify the permissibility in the following situations · The toys are generally in the form of male and female genital organs . Is it permissible for a man to use such a toy and vice versa for a woman. · Is the use permissible only when the couple is together or a man or woman can individually use it when they are alone? Is this not masturbation ? I have a feeling that most people will read your fatwa and use it in this sense. · I would have expected that sex toys are forbidden . Why are they allowed ? In the following ayat : ?The Believers are those who abstain from sex except with those joined to them in marriage bond, or those whom their right hand possess for (in their case) they are free from blame, but those who crave something beyond that are transgressors?. Is the use of sex toys valid because the phrase ?or those whom their right hand possess? applies to it, as that toy is bought and completely in possession ? Shouldn?t the phrase ?but those who crave something beyond that are transgressors? apply to the use of sex toys as it does to masturbation and qualify sex toys as haraam ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt seems that you didn't properly read our answer on the topic. We have reproduced it below for your benefit.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt clearly shows that only such toys can be used that are not inserted in the private parts (thus ruling out vibrators etc) and it also states that such aids can be used to complement and enhance the act of intercourse and not to substitute it, thus it would not be permissible for a man to use an artificial vagina to masturbate himself.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt also clearly mentions that they can only be used in foreplay, thus a person cannot use it on his%2Fher own self, but rather it is an aid used by one partner to arouse another. Masturbation is not permissible, unless performed by the spouse. These toys will not fall under the ayah quoted by you as they are not being used to satisfy ones self, but rather to arouse ones partner. It could be equated to uses ones hand to arouse ones partner.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe hope that this has clarified your doubts.%0D%0A%0D%0AHere is a reproduction of our answer:%0D%0A%0D%0ABefore answering the question, the following principles should be borne in mind:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has mentioned, 'Modesty is part of Imaan (faith).' It is thus necessary to behave in a modest manner at all times and not adopt immoral traits and habits.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Sexual intercourse had many different dimensions to it viz. Fulfilment of a human need, Fulfilment of desires, fun, Increasing the Human race and more especially increasing the Ummah of Sayyiduna Muhammad (Saw), however in addition to all these, another salient feature of intercourse in the eyes of Shariah is that it is an ibadah (An act of worship). Thus when engaging in this act, one should be conscious of Allah Taala and not adopt the reckless abandon so common amongst the Kuffar of these times.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. The tool of intercourse is the private part of the Man, thus usage of any \"aids\" can only be to complement this tool and not to substitute it.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. One should at all times stay far from such situations and places, which if he is seen in, could lead to others entertaining evil thoughts and suspicions about him, even though he was going there for a permissible reason.%0D%0A%0D%0ARegarding the use of Sex toys, their use is permissible with the following conditions:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. It should not cause any internal or external-harm to the body %0D%0A2. It should not contain any haraam ingredients,%0D%0A3. It should not be inserted into the inner-private part of the women, rather such toys should be used that stimulate the outer private parts, such as the clitoris.%0D%0A4. It should only be used in foreplay and in order to enhance the act of intercourse, not to substitute it.%0D%0A5. It should not be used so often that it becomes an integral part of the intercourse, so much so that the spouse then cannot gain sexual gratification without it.%0D%0A6. One should also ensure that he does not commit any Haraam act when acquiring these toys nor should he go to any places of Haraam, such as adult gift shops. Even though one will be going for a valid reason, he is sure to look at Haraam pictures and others who see him enter will probably entertain evil thoughts about him. A possible alternative would be to purchase it over the Internet. %0D%0A%0D%0ALooking at Haram pictures can be easily avoided by switching off the display of pictures on ones browser.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
