  "question": "Why is it that during the bayaans of Tablighi-Jamaat, we are encouraged to read from Fazail-e-Amaal, but no emphasis is given on studying the translation or tafseer of The Qur?aan.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nActually, in many cases, people have been discouraged from studying the Tafseers or translations of the Qur?an by the Saathi. Aren?t these people acting against the very principles of Islam, by keeping Muslims away from acquiring the knowledge of the Qur?an? Emphasis is given on reciting 1 juz a day, but never on understanding what?s recited. Then there are some who say that to understand one has to go to an Alim. There are hardly 1 or 2 Alims in the community, who are already pre-occupied with other things. At this rate, one will never get a chance to understand the very book of guidance.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer attached%0D%0A%0D%0AWe advise you obtain an authentic translation and Tafseer of the Qur'aan and%0D%0Astudy it. We recommend the following English translations: Muhammad%0D%0APickthall (Translation); Muhsin Khan (Translation); Tafseer-e-Usmani (with%0D%0Acommentary); Daryabadi (with commentary); Maariful Qur%E3n (with commentary).%0D%0ANB. Any translation of the Noble Qur%E3n must be accompanied with the Arabic%0D%0Atext next to the translation.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0AQ: Muhtaram Mufti Saheb; Assalaamu Alaikum%0D%0ARecently, a visiting scholar spoke on the topic, ?Should the Qur?aan be read with translation or without translation.? He emphasised on understanding the Qur?aan and reading it with translation. It appeared to me that to read the Qur?aan without translation is not significant. Kindly clarify.%0D%0AA: Allah Ta?ala mentioned the Du?aa of Ebrahim (Alayhis salaam) in the Qur? aan, ?Oh our Rabb, send among them (the Arabs) a prophet, who will make Tilaawat (recite) your verses upon them and teach them the Kitaab (Qur?aan). - (Surah Baqarah; Aayat 129)%0D%0AIn the abovementioned verse, Allah Ta?ala mentioned two different responsibilities of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) regarding the Qur?aan. One is to recite the Qur?aan and the other to teach (explain) the Qur?aan. To recite the Qur?aan is equally important to understanding the Qur?aan. Consider the following points:%0D%0A1. Allah Ta?ala says in the Qur?aan, ?Verily we have revealed the Qur?aan, and we will preserve it.? (Surah al-Hijr Aayat 9) The Qur?aan is defined as, ?A combination of its words and meaning? (Nurul Anwar pg.9; Ashrafi) If there was emphasis only on the meaning of the Qur?aan and not the recitation of its actual words, how would the Qur?aan be preserved? In fact, it is due to the emphasis of the recitation of the actual words of the Qur?aan that the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) taught the words of the Qur?aan to the Taabi?een (Muslims who saw the Sahaaba) and they to the Tabe-Taabi?een (Muslims who saw the Taabi?een), and in this way the Qur?aan was memorized by millions of Huffaaz and preserved till today. If there was emphasis only on the meaning of the Qur?aan and not on the recitation of the Qur?aan, we would be left with only half the Qur?aan, in fact, without any Qur?aan.%0D%0A2. The Qur?aan was originally revealed in the Qurayshi dialect and the Arabs of different tribes with different dialects experienced difficulty in reciting the Qur?aan in the Qurayshi dialect. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) requested Allah Ta?ala to reveal the Qur?aan in the different Arab dialects to make the recitation (not meaning of the Qur?aan) easy upon the Arabs of the other tribes. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?The Qur?aan was revealed upon me in seven words (dialects).? (Mishkaat pg.35; Qadeemi) The purpose of the concession was due to the importance of the recitation of the Qur?aan.%0D%0A3. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) mentioned many virtues for reciting the Qur?aan. He said, ?For every alphabet (not verse or its meaning) recited there are ten rewards.? (Ibid pg.186) It is clear from the above that the mere recitation of the Qur?aan without understanding its meanings is of importance and great virtue.We advise that every Muslim should recite some portion of the Qur?aan daily as the spirituality that flows from the recitation of the actual words of the Qur?aan can never be measured against any Dhikr or Du?aa. An effort should also be made to understand the message of the Qur?aan by attending Tafseer programmes of reliable Ulama and read reliable commentaries of the Qur?aan, for example, Tafseer-e-Usmaani and Tafseer Ma?aariful Qur?aan. When the message of the Qur?aan is understood, it has a great impact in one?s life and creates an ideological and spiritual revolution in an individual which is a driving force to gain proximity to Allah Ta?ala. The month of Ramadhaan is also known to be the month of the Qur?aan in which we should increase our recitation of the Qur?aan as well as endeavour to understand the message of the Qur?aan.%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
