Allah Ta’ala want to guide you and keep you away from bad, evil and sinful acts.\n\n \n\nIt is completely haram (strictly prohibited) for you and the girl to sleep together in one bed. The dirty and filthy acts referred to are haram and major sin. Those sins incur the wrath and anger of Allah.\n\n \n\nYou are now 19 years old. You are baligh. The girl is 13 years old and in all probability she too must be baligh. What if the Shaytan mislead both of you and the fondling etc which are haram lead to intercourse?\n\n \n\nWhat if the girl falls pregnant? Will you be happy? Will she be happy?\n\n \n\nWill you bear all the burden and embarrassment that comes along with that? Will she be able to bear all the embarrassment?\n\n \n\nYou should seriously consider confiding in your mother or father and tell them what has transpired. They will have insight and take the necessary steps to separate your’ll.\n\n \n\nDo remember that you have another brother. The “sister” may also make advancements to him. You need to alert your parents and stop this evil act immediately before you it gets any worse.\n\n \n\nAlso make tawba and repent to Allah Ta’ala. You should immediately reprimand the “sister” and warn her you’ll be telling your parents about her evil actions. This will help her to stop the wrong and protect her chastity.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai"
