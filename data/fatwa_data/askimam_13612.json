  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhy is it that the majority of muslims pray dhur, asr, and the one rakat of maghrib,two rakats of isha ,silently when qur'an clearly says seek a middle course (sura al isra ayat 110) and hadith supports praying aloud as well as tafsir ibn kathir?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nSalah is an act of worship. One expresses his submission to Allah in salah. The procedure of salah is shown to us by Rasulullah (SallaAllahu alayhi wasallam). We do not have a choice in the manner of worship. We do as we are commanded. That is the right course. The middle is adopted when there is no express order.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
