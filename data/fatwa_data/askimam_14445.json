What would the Islamic perspective be for taking such an oath.\n\n\nNaturalization Oath of Allegiance\nto the United States of America\n\nOath:\n\n\"I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and\nabjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state\nor sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or\ncitizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the\nUnited States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I\nwill bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on\nbehalf of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform\nnoncombatant service in the armed forces of the United States when required\nby the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian\ndirection when required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely\nwithout any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God\n\n\nA point to ponder is that a Muslim born in the USA or UK etc becomes a\ncitizen of the said country and has therefore by default accepted a similar\noath of allegiance to their country of citizenship.\n\nA prompt response would be appreciated as she is to move to another town and\nwould then have to wait for another three months and start the whole process\nagain\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe statements of declaration does not include renouncing oneâ€™s faith and religion. In fact, the constitution of the United States of America grants its citizens freedom of religion. As such, Muslims are permitted to freely practise on Islam within the constitution of the United States.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
