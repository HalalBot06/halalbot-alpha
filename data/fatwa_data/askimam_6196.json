  "question": "Pelting Shaytaan in Salaat and 'Umar (R.A) bleeding but keeping wudhu in prayer.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPelting Shaytaan in Salaat and 'Umar (R.A) bleeding but keeping wudhu in prayer. 1)There is a sahi hadith along this line: 'When in the atayyat position in salaat, tapping your finger continuously is as if one is pelting shaytaan. According to Hanafi fiqh, you raise then lower the finger once but it gives the same effect. However, wouldn't it be preferable to 'pelt' shaytaan more than once? 2) According to Hanafi fiqh, bleeding a certain amount of blood (or a discharge) breaks the wudhu (in most cases). However, when 'Umar (R.A) was Caliph, he was stabbed while offering salaat, and well aware of this, but continued to pray. Was his wudhu still valid, and why?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Kindly provide the source of this Saheeh Hadith that you question about.\n2. According to the narrations recorded in Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim,\nthere is no mention of Sayyiduna Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) continuing with\nhis Salaat after being stabbed. In fact, the narrator of this incident says,\n'Just after Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) said the first Takbeer, I heard him\nsay, 'the dog has killed me.' In fact, he further reports, '. Umar\n(Radhiallaahu Anhu) took the hand of Sayyiduna Abdul-Rahmaan ibn Awf\n(Radhiallaahu Anhu) and put him forward' (to complete the Salaat) (Sahih\nBukhari Hadith3700). Hence, your analogy is incorrect.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
