  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhile trading in stocks can we do short sale ie sell stocks in advance and buy them at a lower price later in the day?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are two views of the Ulama regarding investing in unit trusts. Some Ulama are of the opinion that it is permissible to buy unit trusts on condition the shares that are purchased are not from companies that deal in Haraam or major source of their income is Halaal.\n\nOther Ulama are of the opinion that the concept of limited liability in unit trust is against Shariah as the concept of juristic person has no Sharâ€™ie basis.\n\nWe are currently corresponding with those Ulama who are inclined towards permissibility. We have not received any conclusive responses as yet. Once we are satisfied with their arguments we will inform the public accordingly.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
