  "question": "Is L cysteine halaal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs L-cysteine, which is an ingredient found in many bakery products, halaal if it is derived from chicken or duck feathers? I have heard it is not halaal if it derived from human hair, but I?m not sure about chicken feathers. Please do not refer me to another website to find out the answer. Jazakallah for your help.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFeathers do not have any life, thus its consumption is permissible as long as it isn't harmful. (See Ahkamul Quran of Jassaas Vol.1 Pg.149-Ihya ut Turath, Bahr Vol.1 Pg.113)\n\nThe product derived from feathers can also be consumed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Husain Kadodia\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Ml. Imraan Vawda"
