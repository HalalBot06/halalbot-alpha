  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ: Muhtaram Mufti Saheb; Assalaamu Alaikum ? Kindly explain to us how a teacher should treat his students. What should he do if the students are disobedient? Is it permissible to punish them? If so, to what extent?%0D%0A%0D%0ARespected Brother-in-Islam; Wa alaykumus salaam%0D%0A%0D%0AAlmighty Allah Ta?ala outlines the mission of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) on earth as follows: It is He (Allah) who sent to the Ummiyyeen (unlettered) a Prophet from among them who recites upon them His Aayaat (Qur?aan) and purifies them and teaches them the Kitaab (Qur?aan) and Wisdom.? (Surah Aale Imraan Verse 164)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn a Hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?I am sent as a teacher.? (Ibn Maaja vol.1 pg.83; Beirut). Almighty Allah Ta?ala bestowed Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) with intellectual and phsychological skills to be a perfect teacher. Hadhrat Mu?aawiyah ibn Hakam (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates, ?I have never seen and will never see a teacher better than Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). I take an oath in the name of Allah, he did not rebuke, hit nor reprimand me.? (Muslim vol.5 pg.20; Beirut)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe first Madrasah in Islam was at the raised platform behind the house of Hadhrat Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha). The students of that Madrasah commonly known As-haab al-Suffa (Radhiallaahu Anhum) were the guests of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). He spoke about their virtues to others and fulfilled their needs. It was this love and affection that attached the Sahaaba with Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and made it possible to derive benefit from him. The Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum), in turn, passed over their knowledge to the Ummah. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)?s attitude towards his Sahaaba (students) was of care and love. He said, ?I am to you like a father to his son.? (Mishkaat pg.42; Qadeemi) He (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) also emphasised that a teacher should treat his students with care and respect. Hadhrat Abu Saeed Khudri (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?People from far and wide will come to you in order to study and understand Deen. You should treat them kindly.? (Mishkaat pg.34; Qadeemi). Therefore, a teacher should embrace the opportunity by showing love to his students and plant in them his seeds of knowledge. Be thankful to the students that they have offered their fields (hearts) to plant in them your seeds of knowledge. If there are no students of Deen, who will learn Deen? especially in contemporary times when the world offers many other opportunities. They have sacrificed and come to you. Appreciate their sacrifices and sacrifice yourself behind them. Imaam Abu Yusuf (RA), the famous student of Imaam Abu Hanifa (RA), advised that treat your students with so much care and love that people regard them as your children. (Aadabul Muallimeen pg.13; Rahmaniyyah) Our pious predecessors used to serve students of Deen as though they were masters. In one instance, during a discourse of Moulana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi (RA), it started raining. The students picked up their books and ran to shelter. They left their shoes in the rain. Moulana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi Saheb (RA) picked up the shoes of his students and placed them under the shelter. (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, if a student misbehaves and that interrupts his studies as well as the studies of his fellow colleagues, the teacher should apply wisdom and diplomacy in advising him. If the teacher treats such a student like his own child and makes Du?aa for the success of that student, Insha Allah, that student will be disciplined and will prosper in his studies. If the teacher is unsuccessful, he should communicate his difficulty with his administration or parent of the child. He should not resort to hitting the child as that may be a set back to the education of the child. How can the teacher fill the child?s container (heart) with knowledge by making a hole in that container (breaking the heart)? Furthermore, the teacher should be conscious of the implications and negative consequences of hitting the child.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is indeed unfortunate that the need arose to establish a child protection unit. To a large extent, its establishment is due to our shortcomings. However, the child protection unit too may cherish the opportunity to disgrace Islam and its teachings by presenting a mole hill as a mountain. They should not be given such an opportunity.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf all possible methods of disciplining the child fails, then as a last resort one may punish the student with the following conditions:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. The punishment should be to reform the child and not to give vent to one?s anger. If the teacher has no control over himself, how will be able to control his student?%0D%0A%0D%0A2. It is not permissible to hit more than three strokes at once. (Shaami vol.1 pg.352; HM Saeed)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. It is Haraam to hit on the face, damage the skin, break the bones and leave marks on the body. In such a situation, the teacher is liable for punishment.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta?ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0ADarul Ifta - Madrasah In'aamiyyah"
