  "question": "Can I apply for visa before marriage?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-o-alaikum, I am an engineer working at Saudi Arabia. Inshallah I am getting married on 25th December. As per laws I have to apply for visa to bring my wife. Seniors suggest me to apply for visa before hand so that i can bring her after marriage. Will it be ok? As per laws I do not have to mention my spouse name for visa application, just I have to produce a nikahnama, which I can get from my home place.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to our understanding, this will require you to make a false Nikahnama.\n\nIf our understanding is correct, then it is not permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
