  "question": "Due to busy working hours, I miss my zhur and Asar nameez everyday. Could you please let me know that if I can pray missed nameez and what time I can read these nameez.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBrother, I would like to remind you of the lofty status Salah holds in Islam and that salah has been classified as the dividing line between Iman and Kufr. Busy working hours can never be a valid excuse to miss salah. There are thousand nay millions with very busy working hours, yet they make time for salah.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe honestly believe that sustenance is from Allah and only Allah can put blessing in it. How do we expect it to be blessed when in attaining it we are breaking such an important command of Allah. Please make a firm determinatuion to perform your salah on time; where there is a will there is a way.%0D%0A%0D%0AThen make some time, it is not neccessary for you to go to the masjid if very difficult, perform salah in your workplace, in a corner somewhere. Zuhr salah can be prayed right until before Asr time enters, while asr can be prayed until before sunset, however delaying it is not advised.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf you are forbidded from this too and there is absolutely no way that you will be allowed to perform it at all, then we would advise you to seek alternative employment, as this job is only earning you Allah's anger.%0D%0A%0D%0APlease make Qadha(make up) which ever salahs you have missed. This can be done at any time (besides, Zawaal, sunrisae and sunset), however it must be done as soon as possible. Not only can you pray missed salah's but you must.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMl. Husain Kadodia%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED & APPROVED: Ml. Imraan Vawda"
