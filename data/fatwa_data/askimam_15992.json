  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissable in islam to stand naked infront of your husband?please inform me if there is any shariah rulings in this regard?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is permissible. However, the issue of Hayaa (modesty) must be borne in mind. It is an inherent quality of a believer to be modest and shameful. Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said “When Hayaa (modesty) is lost in a person, then he/she may do whatever he/she wants”. That is no wrong will appear to be serious to a person void of modesty.\n\nFurthermore, the Ulama state that the actions of the parents have a bearing upon the child to be conceived there-from. If the parents conduct themselves with modesty, the effect of their modesty will pass over to their children. Conversely, they will be affected with the immodest behavior of the parents.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
