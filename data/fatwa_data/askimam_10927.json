  "question": "can we use shoes that are lined with pig skin?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nmany imported shoes come with pig skin lining and even the insloes are made of pig skin. many muslims cannot identify this and they are neither informed or concerned.pig skin is very disticnt in characteristics having pores in 3's in a triangle. how do we inform the muslims public if it is haraam to wear these shoes? Shukrun\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to Shariah, a pig is considered as Najisul-Ain(impure). The\nskin will remain impure even after manufacture. Therefore it is not\npermissible to wear shoes with pig lining. In South Africa we have many\navenues wherein the muslims could be informed of this, either through\nthe media tools or the writings of the Ulama. We will include this\nquestion in our next issue of the Al-Mahmood.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT"
