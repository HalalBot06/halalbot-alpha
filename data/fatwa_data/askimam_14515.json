  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs working for Zionist company Halal\n\nAs_Salamunalikum I am working for a software company name IBM(International Buisness machines) its one of the biggest multinational companies of the world. The work culture is also good and i am also getting time for namaz. i am pretty happy with the way things are going. Recently i found out on the internet certain links which says IBM supports zionism. I am giving you this link where the name of IBM is specified as zionist supporter 1> http://www.islam-shia.org/boycott_israel/Zionist_companies.htm. 2> http://islamiczone.netfirms.com/what_to_boycott_and_how.htm I really dont know and comment on the authentication of these link and the contents listed in them and also it is difficult for me to verify whether IBM is a Zionist supporter or not. the reason why this site no 1 feels that IBM is a zionist supporter is. \"IBM invest heavily in Israel. IBM senior vice-president and general counsel, Lawrence Ricciardi, who noted that his company employs 1,700 people in Israel, said in an interview with the Jerusalem Post, \"This wedge of land and the huge ideals it represents are very important to IBM.\" IBM was one of three US companies that wase lauded at the America-Israel Friendship League Partners for Democracy Awards dinner (25th June 2001) hosted by Sharon. \" My question is that now can i work for this company. Is it halal or Haram working for this company please suggest as i am feeling very uncomfortable.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to the Shari’ah, it is permissible for a Muslim to deal with non-Muslims. As such, it is permissible for a Muslim to work for IBM even if IBM supports Zionism. If you are uncomfortable working there because of IBM supporting Zionism, then follow the guidance of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], ‘If something boarders your hearts, leave it.’\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
