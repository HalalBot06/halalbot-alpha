  "answer": "QUESTION\nthere is a dua to recite after 'Salatul Hajaat' included by Allama jazri ..the translation is \"O Allah, while setting my face towards You i beg You through the intermdeiary of Muhammed, ........O Muhammed, through your intermediary do i set my face towards my Lord......\"??? What is this O Muhammed in this supplication? why is this not shirk (as we accuse Burelvis of) when they do the same thing..very confused\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour query is about the Waseela. Hereunder is our standard response to%0D%0AWaseela.%0D%0A%0D%0APermissible Waseelas%0D%0A%0D%0A1) To make dua to Allah Ta'ala and to ask Allah to fulfill ones needs%0D%0Athrough the waseela of a Nabi or a Wali (friend of Allah). Nabi alaihis%0D%0Asalaam taught a Sahabi to make dua through him (Nabi alaihis salaam). Refer%0D%0Ato Tirmizi Shareef vol. 2 pg. 197 and Mishkaat pg. 219.%0D%0A%0D%0A2) Umar radiyaalahu anhu at the time of drought use to make dua and take the%0D%0Awaseela of Abbaas radiyaalahu anhu, the paternal uncle of Nabi alaihis%0D%0Asalaam. Refer to Mishkaat pg. 132 and also Bukhaari.%0D%0A%0D%0A3) To use the waseela of ones good deeds is also Jaaiz as mentioned in the%0D%0AHadith of the 'Ghaar' (cave), when the 3 men were locked in a cave by a rock%0D%0Awhich blocked the entrance. Each one of the 3 men through the waseela of one%0D%0Aof his good deeds implores Allah to remove the rock and accordingly Allah%0D%0Aremoved the rock. Refer to Riyaadus Saaliheen by Imaam Nawawi.%0D%0A%0D%0AImpermissible Waseelas%0D%0A1) To ask anyone or thing to fulfill ones needs besides Allah Ta'ala.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
