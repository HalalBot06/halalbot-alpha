  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nHadhrat sahab, I saw your fatwa disallowing to work at a place where there is lotto machine and cigarettes. My condition is that in my area in Calgary there is a dire need of a masjid and alhamdulillah our people have also bought a plot for it. The deadline to pay the price is 15th May and still we have to pay 50000-100000 in this 12 day period. Now can I work at a gas station where I have to sell lottery  tickets and cigarettes (i have no other choice because othis is the only place i've tried my best to work)  and then give my all salary for the mosque? In this way will my money be halal as we are in dire need of money?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIt is permissible for you to work at the gas station. However, you should not involve yourself in the sales of lotto tickets as this is a kind of cooperating in sin and transgression which displeases Allāh jalla jalāluhu.\n\n \n\nAllāh jalla jalāluhu only accepts pure.  A Masjid is a house of Allāh jalla jalāluhu. He will create means from unknown sources. Don’t transgress the laws of Shari῾a to build His house. Those who fear Allah jalla jalāluhu, Allah jalla jalāluhu will make a way for them.\n\n\n“He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allāh, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allāh will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allāh has set a measure for all things”\n\n(Surah Talāq,65:3)[1]\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl. Abdur Rahman Shareef,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā\n\n\n\n\n[1]   وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَنْ يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَالِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدْرًا(الطلاق،3)"
