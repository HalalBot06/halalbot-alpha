  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) Is the use of muscle enhancing steroids permissible by shariah during weight training? 2) If sexual intercourse is performed whilst partially clothed, i.e. jacket, baseball cap etc is worn, would these items then be considered impure and require washing? 3) If sexual intercourse takes place on leather seating and leaves impure fluids, would the leather seating be considered clean, if wiped with wet wipes etc, or do they have to be cleaned in a different manner? 4) If sexual intercourse takes place in a car and leaving impure fluid remains on the seat, would simple valeting of the seats be considered sufficient (clean)?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Steroids can be used for muscle enhancing if prescribed by a doctor or a fitness trainer. However, to take it without the consent of an expert, could be harmful depending on the type of steroid taken.\n\n2. No, they will not be considered impure unless ome fluids falls on it.\n\n3. Leather does not absorb fluids, so by wiping with a wet cloth it will become clean.\n\n4. If soap or any of her cleansing agent was used when valeting the seats through which the impure fluids are removed, it will become clean.
