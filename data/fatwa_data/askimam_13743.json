When he returned, he asked Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], ‘Will it be of any benefit if I give charity on her behalf?’ Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] replied in the affirmative. (Sahih Bukhari Hadfith2762)\n\nIsaal-e-Sawaab (to perform a virtuous act and grant the reward to any person – alive or deceased – it is permissible and in fact Mustahabb (meritorious). There are basically 2 forms of Isaal-e-sawaab:\n\n1. Conveying of the rewards of charitable deeds.\n\n2. Conveying of reward of physical deeds that do not entail wealth, e.g. Salaat, fasting, Dhikr, etc.\n\nWhen a person makes Isaal-e-sawaab for the deceased, the punishment and grief of the deceased is made less and the stages of the deceased is increased. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyah vol.10 pg.284). Allah states in the Qur’aan, ‘And for you (in Jannah) is what you desire.’ (41:31)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
