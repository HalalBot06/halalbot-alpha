  "question": "Is the work of calling towards Allah (Dawah & Tableegh) obligatory on every muslim",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs the work of calling towards Allah (Dawah & Tableegh) obligatory on every muslim who is in ummah of Hazrat Muhammad (Peace be upon him) or it is obligatory only on the Ulema of this ummah. Is it true to say that this ummah is created to perform the work of Dawah & Tableegh after the end of prophethood upon Hazrat Muhammad (peace be upon him). What is the difference between Amar Bil Maru'f / Nahi Anil Munkir and Dawah/ Tableegh.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. In those Ahaadith and verses of the Qur’aan wherein Allah Ta’ala ordered Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) to give Da’awah and invite towards Deen of Allah, this also includes each and every person who claims that he is the follower of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). It is incumbent and obligatory on such a person to do the work of Tabligh and Da’awah.\n\n2. Yes, it is true. The main objective of our creation is to worship and recognize Allah Ta’ala. In order for this to happen, each and every Muslim has a responsibility on his/her shoulders to perform this work of Da’awah and Tabligh. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) showed us the straight path. It is not our duty to continue treading that path and also show it to others. Allah Ta’ala states, ‘You are the best of nations taken out for the benefit of mankind, calling towards good and preventing evil…’\n\n3. Every person will be questioned according to this situation, e.g. if a person is the owner of a business and he had non-Muslim employees and associates, he will be questioned as to whether he had conveyed the message to them. If a person has somebody doing his household chores, he will be questioned regarding this, or the king will be questioned regarding his subordinates. He will not be questioned regarding those non-Muslims around the world or any non-Muslim who he do not know and have no acquaintance with. Only those who are his family, friends, associates (in whatever aspects), subordinates, etc.\n\n4. It is basically the same thing of inviting towards the Deen of Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
