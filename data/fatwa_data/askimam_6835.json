  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamoalaikum! Kindly elaborate, whether live video or recorded video has any difference? is Live permissible?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Ulama differ in their opinions regarding the images that appear on TV and videos.\n\nAccording to many reliable Ulama like Mufti Taqi Usmani Saheb, that is not strictly Tasweer (picture making) as it is not in durable form - refer albalagh.net Many other reliable Ulama do not differentiate between an image being durable or not. Hence, images on TV and videos is Tasweer and prohibited. It is, therefore, best to exercise precaution and abstain from any form of electronic capturing of animate picture.\n\nHowever, in view of the differences of opinion, there is a leeway only in the case of dire need, for example, to expose massacre and oppression against Muslims. That is not so in using a video for entertainments like in marriage ceremonies and parties.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
