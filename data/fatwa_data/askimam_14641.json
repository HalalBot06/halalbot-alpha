May Allah bless you and this site.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\nIt is not clear whether you are a male or a female. If you are a male you should assist the person to understand Islam. You should also make Dua for him. If you are a female, then refer the person to a reliable Muslim male to assist him. You can make general Dua of guidance for non Muslims.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
