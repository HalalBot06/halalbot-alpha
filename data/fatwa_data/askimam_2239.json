  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Saheb, I am from kutch-bhuj, Gujarat, India. My place is badly effected by earthquack. Also house and workshop is destroyed. Now question is that lot many people are comming to help us, We are confused what help and from whom we can take help ? Help Resources : Private Organinization, Goverment and individual (known and un-known). Helping For : 1. Daily need (food, cloth, madicin, tent for stay etc.) 2. Construction of new home. One thing more my parent plan for haj money is paid for it. also ticket is confirmed. Now what should we do cancel the trip or go for haj ? I can't say them to cancel for it because they are too much willing to go. If one say cancel it, they will feel bad. Please help me in above situation. Zajakallah khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is permissible for the people of Bhuj to accept any assistance from\nany organisation, Muslim or non-Muslim, private or government. However,\nMuslims should guard their Imaan when accepting the assistance of private\nnon-Muslim organisations as they use the opportunity to propagate their\nreligion.\n2. If arrangements for Hajj is made you should proceed and embrace the\nopportunity to make Du'aa for the people of Bhuj.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
