  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) me and my mother always scream to me without any reason what should i do???\n\n2) my wife sometime have her on mind and does not listen to me sometimes???\n\n3) i´m little bit heavy did rasulullahSAW teach us which kind of food should we eat because i want to lose but it is very hard for me\n\n4) and i like to study alim but my mother and wife don´t want what should i do?\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIf your mother shout and screams at you, you should tolerate her and overlook her.  It is natural for you to be upset but contain yourself.  When you were a baby and you threw tantrums, she also used to get upset but she tolerated and raised you.  She didn’t abandon you or throw you away.  Now she is old and she conducts herself as you conducted yourself when you were a baby, it is your time to tolerate her and serve her.  Be humble and kind to her.  She will realize and give you Duas.\nThe best way to incline someone towards you is good character and humbleness.  Be kind to your wife and demonstrate to her good character.  She will also respond to you likewise. \nYou should consider doing some form of exercise daily even if it is walking. \nYou should identify an alim locally and request him to teach you the aalim course.\n\n \n\nI have heard that there are reliable and good Ulema in .\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\nThe guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\nEducation and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\nIslam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\nWhen one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\nMuslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\nWe have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\nIf you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\nIf that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\nRasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit”.\n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
