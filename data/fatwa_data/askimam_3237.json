  "question": "Toilet is already facing Qiblah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf in a Masjid or Ibaadat Khaana, the toilets have already been built facing Qiblah by mistake/unknowingly or by a shafi, and now it is difficult and expensive to change it, is there any permissibility/gonjaayish for us to use the toilets as they are?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ: A toilet inside the house faces the Qiblah. Is it permissible to use the\ntoilet, or should the direction be changed?\nA: Hadhrat Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu √Ånhu) narrates that Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'I am to you like a father to a son, do\nnot face the front or back towards the Qiblah (when relieving onself).'\n(Tirmidhi vol.1 pg.8; HM Saeed Company). According to the above Hadith, when\nrelieving oneself, it is not permissible to face the front or back towards\nthe Qiblah. Therefore, the direction of the toilet should be changed.\nHowever, if that is not possible, one should sit in a posture, away from the\nactual direction of the Qiblah. (Ibid)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
