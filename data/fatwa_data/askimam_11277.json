  "question": "Divorce between parents - What happens to a husband/father who mistreats his wife and children on the Day of Judgement?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy parents have three children - Me (24 years), my brother (20), and my sister (11). I need your advice about what to do about my parents - My mother caught my father having an affair, and they haven't spoken to one another for 7 years. On top of that, my father repeatedly talks about my mother behind her back (In a negative way), and even though relatives have told them to divorce repeatedly if they don't like one another (they've also told them to patch things up), they still don't care. On top of that, my father gives my mother just enough money to buy food, but spends a lot on himself. My mother wants to fix the relationship (Although recently, she seems to have given up), but he doesn't... It's as though he enjoys making her suffer by giving her next to nothing for clothes etc. Years ago, he used to blame a lot of his problems on her, when she had nothing to di with it. I have had to restrain myself many times, because in the end, he is my father, but I need advice on what to do. Please don't tell me to get them to sit in a room together and talk, because I've already tried that numerous times. Please advise... 1. What to do? 2. How should a husband treat his wife & children, and 3. What happens to a husband/father who mistreats his wife and children on the Day of Judgement?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is rather a painful situation when a child sees his%2F her parents experiencing marital problems the pain increases seeing the one who is wronged.
