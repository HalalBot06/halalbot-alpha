  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nISTIKHAARAH%0D%0AWHAT IS ISTIKHAARAH?%0D%0A%0D%0AIstikhaarah is to seek guidance from Allah when one is faced with a problem%0D%0Ato which no solution is apparent.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhenever a person is faced with a difficult problem, or becomes hesitant in%0D%0Amaking a decision and his knowledge of the matter is insufficient to guide%0D%0Ahim then after seeking advice from trusted friends he should turn to Allah%0D%0Aand beseech His grace. He should willingly and with an open heart and mind%0D%0Asupplicate for divine guidance and ask for direction so that the problem is%0D%0Asolved in his own best interest. The Du'aa at such an occasion is called%0D%0AIstikhaarah.%0D%0A%0D%0AIstikhaarah is in fact an invaluable teaching of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) with which the Muslims have been favoured. This blessing%0D%0Acould give solace to many for all times to come. It is related in the Hadith%0D%0Athat Rasulullah (SAW) use to teach the Istikhaarah to the Sahaabah (RA) like%0D%0Athe Qur'an is taught to children. In another Hadith it is stated that 'He%0D%0Adoes not fail who makes Istikhaarah and he does not regret who makes%0D%0AMashwarah (consultation).%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the Masnoon Istikhaarah, after one has carried out his responsibility as%0D%0Abest as one can, one should hand over the entire matter and oneself to the%0D%0Alimitless knowledge of Allah Ta'ala. By resorting to Istikhaarah one is now%0D%0Aretrieved of making a decision on ones own.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhenever counsel is sought from a respectable and experienced person, it is%0D%0Aexpected that he will give good advise and assist to the best of his%0D%0Aability. Similarly Istikhaarah is to seek counsel that the all-Knowing and%0D%0AMerciful Allah? Once Istikhaarah is made then Allah Ta'ala will surely guide%0D%0Ahim to do what is best for him.%0D%0A%0D%0ANow there can be no perplexity. Only that will happen which Allah Ta'ala%0D%0Awills and which is good for ones own sake though one may not be able to see%0D%0Ait immediately. It is not necessary that one must experience or see an%0D%0Aevident change or vision. Allah Ta'ala alone knows what is best for His%0D%0Aservants. It is related in the Hadith that 'Success and good tidings for the%0D%0Ason of Aadam (Insaan) is in performing Istikhaarah and his misfortune lies%0D%0Ain not making Istikhaarah'.%0D%0A%0D%0AMETHOD OF ISTIKHAARAH%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen making Istikhaarah begin with performing two Rakaats Nafl Salaat. Then%0D%0Awith all sincerity recite the following Du'a.%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AAllaahumma innee astakheeruka bi ilmika wa-astaqdiruka biqudratika%0D%0Awa-as'aluka min fadhlika al-adheem. Fa innaka taqdiru walaa aqdiru. Wa%0D%0Ata'lamu walaa a'alamu wa anta allaamul ghuyoob. Allaahumma in kunta ta'lamu%0D%0Aanna haadhal-amr khayrun liy fiy deeniy wa-ma'aashiy wa-aaqibat amriy,%0D%0Afa'qdruhliy wa-yassirh liy thumma baarik liy feehi. Wa in-kunta ta'lamu anna%0D%0Ahaadhal amr sharrun liy fiy deeniy wa-ma'aashiy was-'aaqibat amriy. Fa%0D%0Aasrifh annee wa-srif 'anhu.

Behold I ask You the good through Your Knowledge, and%0D%0Aability through Your Power, and beg (Your favour) out of Your infinite%0D%0ABounty. For surely You have Power; I have none.

If in Your Knowledge this matter be good for my faith (Deen), for%0D%0Amy livelihood, and for the consequences of my affairs, then ordain it for%0D%0Ame, and make it easy for me, and bless me therein.%0D%0ABut if in Your Knowledge, this matter be bad for my faith (Deen) for my%0D%0Alivelihood, and for the consequences of my affairs, then turn it away from%0D%0Ame, and turn me away therefrom, and ordain for me the good wherever it be,%0D%0Aand cause me to be pleased therewith.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhile reciting this Du'aa when one reaches HAADHAL AMR (THIS MATTER) at both%0D%0Aplaces he should think of his problem.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah guide and assist us all, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0AWatervall Islamic Institute%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A"
