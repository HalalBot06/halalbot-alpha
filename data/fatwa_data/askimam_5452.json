  "question": "1.Are women allowed to have long nails in Islam? 2.Are we allowed to read the nightly waazifaas (eg surah sajida,waqiyah) before magrib salaat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) It is Mustahabb (commendable and desirable) to pair the finger nails%0D%0Aevery Friday. Only a Mujahid is exempted from this and it is preferrable%0D%0Athat he lenghtens his nails because it can be used as a weapon to attack the%0D%0Aenemy. It was aso the blessed habit of Nabi alaihis salaam that he would%0D%0Apair his nails and not let them grow long. It is also noted in the books on%0D%0AJurisprudence that he who lengthens his nails, his sustenance and income%0D%0Abecomes straitened and restricted. (Shaami vol. 6 pg. 405, H.M. Saeed).%0D%0A%0D%0AAlso, one should remenber that at the time of wudhu it is necessary for the%0D%0Avalidity of the wudhu that water reaches below the nails if the nails are%0D%0Alonger than normal. Many a times women are busy in their choirs of the%0D%0Akitchen wherein different types of ingredients tend to stick under the nails%0D%0Aand if not removed, Wudhu will be invalid if it does reach the bottom of the%0D%0Anails. Therefore it will not be permissible to keep long nails%0D%0Aunnecessarily.%0D%0A%0D%0A2) The virtues concerning these surahs are normally mentioned for when they%0D%0Aare recited in the night. According to Islam, night will refer to that time%0D%0Aafter Maghrib Salaat and not the time before the salaat of Maghrib.%0D%0ATherefore, these surahs will have to recited in their respective specified%0D%0Atimes in order to reap the complete benefits and rewards.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
