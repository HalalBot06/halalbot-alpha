  "question": "Is it permissable to have bonds and shares?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it permissable to have bonds and shares?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPrinciples of Shariah Governing Islamic Investment Funds\n\nBy Mufti Taqi Usmani\n\n- Equity Fund\n- Conditions for Investment in Shares\n- Ijarah Fund\n- Commodity Fund\n- Murabahah Fund\n- Bai'-al-dain\n- Mixed Fund\n\nThe term \"Islamic Investment Fund\" in this article means a joint pool\nwherein the investors contribute their surplus money for the purpose of its\ninvestment to earn halal profits in strict conformity with the precepts of\nIslamic Shariah. The subscribers of the Fund may receive a document\ncertifying their subscription and entitling them to the pro-rated profits\nactually accrued to the Fund. These documents may be called \"certificates\"\n\"units\" \"shares\" or may be given any other name, but their validity in terms\nof Shariah, will always be subject to two basic conditions:\n\nFirst, instead of a fixed return tied up with their face value, they must\ncarry a pro-rated profit actually earned by the Fund. Therefore, neither the\nprincipal nor a rate of profit (tied up with the principal) can be\nguaranteed. The subscribers must enter into the fund with a clear\nunderstanding that the return on their subscription is tied up with the\nactual profit earned or loss suffered by the Fund. If the Fund earns huge\nprofits, the return in their subscription will increase to that proportion;\nhowever, in case the Fund suffers loss, they will have to share it also,\nunless the loss is caused by the negligence or mismanagement, in which case\nthe management, and not the Fund, will be liable to compensate it.\n\nSecond, the amounts so pooled together must be invested in a business\nacceptable to Shariah. It means that not only the channels of investment,\nbut also the terms agreed with them must conform to the Islamic principles.\n\nKeeping these basic requisites in view, the Islamic Investment Funds may\naccommodate a variety of modes of investment which are discussed briefly in\nthe following paragraphs.\n\nEquity Fund\n\nIn an equity fund the amounts are invested in the shares of joint stock\ncompanies. The profits are mainly achieved through the capital gains by\npurchasing the shares and selling them when their prices are increased.\nProfits are also achieved by the dividends distributed by the relevant\ncompanies.\n\nIt is obvious that if the main business of a company is not lawful in terms\nof Shariah, it is not allowed for an Islamic Fund to purchase, hold or sell\nits shares, because it will entail the direct involvement of the share\nholder in that prohibited business.\n\nSimilarly the contemporary Shariah experts are almost unanimous on the point\nthat if all the transactions of a company are in full conformity with\nShariah, which includes that the company neither borrows money on interest\nnor keeps its surplus in an interest bearing account, its shares can be\npurchased, held and sold without any hindrance from the Shariah side. But\nevidently, such companies are very rare in the contemporary stock markets.\nAlmost all the companies quoted in the present stock market or in some way\ninvolved in an activity which violates the injunctions of Shariah.\n\nEven if the main business of a company is halal, its borrowings are based on\ninterest\". On the other hand, they keep their surplus money in an interest\nbearing account or purchase interest bearing bonds or securities.\n\nThe case of such companies has been a matter of debate between the Shariah\nexperts in the present century. A group of the Shariah experts is of the\nview that it is not allowed for a Muslim to deal in the shares of such a\ncompany, even if its main business is halal. Their basic argument is that\nevery share-holder of a company is a sharik (partner) of the company, and\nevery sharik, according to the Islamic jurisprudence, is an agent for the\nother partners in the matters of the joint business. Therefore, the mere\npurchase of a share of a company embodies an authorization from the\nshare-holder to the company to carry on its business in whatever manner the\nmanagement deems fit. If it is known to the share-holder that the company is\ninvolved in an un-Islamic transaction, still, he holds the shares of that\ncompany, it means that he has authorized the management to proceed with that\nun-Islamic transaction. In this case, he will not only be responsible for\ngiving his consent to an un-Islamic transaction, but that transaction will\nalso be rightfully attributed to himself, because the management of the\ncompany is working under his tacit authorization.\n\nMoreover, when a company is financed on the basis of interest, its funds\nemployed in the business are impure. Similarly, when the company receives\ninterest on its deposits an impure element is necessarily included in its\nincome which will be distributed to the share-holders through dividends.\n\nHowever, a large number of the present day scholars do not endorse this\nview. They argue that a joint stock company is basically different from a\nsimple partnership period. In partnership, all the policy decisions are\ntaken by the consensus of all the partners, and each one of them has a veto\npower with regard to the policy of business. Therefore, all the actions of a\npartnership are rightfully attributed to each partner. Conversely, the\npolicy decisions in a joint stock company are taken by the majority. Being\ncomposed of a large number of share-holders, a company cannot give a veto\npower to each share-holder. The opinions of individual share-holders can be\noverruled by a majority decision. Therefore, each and every action taken by\nthe company cannot be attributed to every share-holder in his individual\ncapacity. If a share-holder raises an objection against a particular\ntransaction in an annual general meeting, but his objection is overruled by\nthe majority, it will not be fair to conclude that he has given his consent\nto the transaction in his individual capacity, specially when he intends to\nwithdraw from the income attributable to that transaction.\n\nTherefore, if a company is engaged in a halal business, however, it keeps\nits surplus money in an interest-bearing account, wherefrom a small\nincidental income of interest is received, it does not render all the\nbusiness of the company unlawful. Now, if a person acquires the shares of\nsuch a company with clear intention that he will oppose the incidental\ntransaction also, and will not use that proportion of the dividend for his\nown benefit, how can it be said that he has approved the transaction of\ninterest and how can that transaction be attributed to him?\n\nThe other aspect of the dealings of such a company that it sometimes borrows\nmoney from financial institutions. These borrowings are mostly based on\ninterest. Here again the same principal is relevant. If a share-holder is\nnot personally agreeable to such borrowings, but has been overruled by the\nmajority, these borrowing transactions cannot be attributed to him.\n\nMoreover, according to the principals of Islamic jurisprudence borrowing on\ninterest is a grave sinful act for which the borrower is responsible in the\nHereafter; however, this sinful act does not render the whole business of\nthe borrower as haram impermissible. The borrowed amount being recognized as\nowned by the borrower, anything purchased in exchange of that money is not\nunlawful. Therefore, the responsibility of committing a sinful act of\nborrowing on interest rests with the person who willfully indulged in a\ntransaction of interest, but this fact does not render the whole business of\na company as un-lawful.\n\nConditions for Investment in Shares\n\nIn the light of the forgoing discussion, dealing in equity shares can be\nacceptable in Shariah subject to the following conditions:\n\n1. The main business of the company is not in violation of Shariah.\nTherefore, it is not permissible to acquire the shares of the companies\nproviding financial services on interest, like conventional banks, insurance\ncompanies, or the companies involved in some other business not approved by\nthe Shariah, such as the companies manufacturing, selling or offering\nliquors, pork, haram meat, or involved in gambling, night club activities,\npornography etc.\n\n2. If the main business of the companies is halal, like automobiles,\ntextile, etc. but they deposit there surplus amounts in a interest-bearing\naccount or borrow money on interest, the share holder must express his\ndisapproval against such dealings, preferably by raising his voice against\nsuch activities in the annual general meeting of the company.\n\n3. If some income from interest-bearing accounts is included in the income\nof the company, the proportion of such income in the dividend paid to the\nshare-holder must be given charity, and must not be retained by him. For\nexample, if 5% of the whole income of a company has come out of\ninterest-bearing deposits, 5% of the dividend must be given in charity.\n\n4. The shares of a company are negotiable only if the company owns some\nnon-liquid assets. If all the assets of a company are in liquid form, i.e.\nin the form of money that cannot be purchased or sold, except on par value,\nbecause in this case the share represents money only and the money cannot be\ntraded in except at par.\n\nWhat should be the exact proportion of non-liquid assets of a company for\nthe negotiability of its shares? The contemporary scholars have different\nviews about this question. Some scholars are of the view that the ratio of\nnon-liquid assets must be 51% at the least. They argue that if such assets\nare less than 50%, the most of the assets are in liquid form, therefore, all\nits assets should be treated as liquid on the basis of the juristic\nprinciple: The majority deserves to be treated as the whole of a thing. Some\nother scholars have opined that even if the non-liquid asset of a company or\n33%, its shares can be treated as negotiable.\n\nThe third view is based on the Hanafi jurisprudence. The principle of the\nHanafi school is that whenever an asset is a mixture of a liquid and\nnon-liquid assets, it can be negotiable irrespective of the proportion of\nits liquid part. However, this principle is subject to two conditions:\n\nFirst, the non-liquid part of the mixture must not be in a negligible\nquantity. It means that it should be in a considerable proportion. Second,\nthe price of the mixture should be more than the price of the liquid amount\ncontained therein. For example, if a share of 100 dollars represents 75\ndollars, plus some fixed assets the price of the share must be more than 75\ndollars. In this case, if the price of the share is fixed as 105, it will\nmean that 75 dollars are in exchange of 75 dollars owned by the share and\nthe rest of 30 dollars are in exchange of the fixed asset. Conversely, if\nthe price of that share fixed as 70 dollars, it will not be allowed, because\nthe 75 dollars owned by the share are in this case against an amount which\nis less than 75. This kind of exchange falls within the definition of \"riba\"\nand is not allowed. Similarly, if the price of the share, in the above\nexample, is fixed as 75 dollars, it will not be permissible, because if we\npresume that 75 dollars owned by the share, no part of the price can be\nattributed to the fixed assets owned by the share. Therefore, some part of\nthe price (75 dollars) must be presumed to be in exchange of the fixed\nassets of the share. In this case, the remaining amount will not be adequate\nfor the price of 75 dollars. For this reason the transaction will not be\nvalid.\n\nHowever, in practical terms, this is merely a theoretical possibility,\nbecause it is difficult to imagine a situation where a price of the share\ngoes lower than its liquid assets.\n\nSubject to these conditions, the purchase and sale of shares is permissible\nin Shariah. An Islamic Equity Fund can be established on this basis. The\nsubscribers to the Fund will be treated in Shariah as partners \"inter se.\"\nAll the subscription amounts will form a joint pool and will be invested in\npurchasing the shares of different companies. The profits can accrue either\nthrough dividends distributed by the relevant companies or through the\nappreciation in the prices of the shares. In the first case i.e. where the\nprofits earned through dividends, a certain proportion of the dividend,\nwhich corresponds to the proportion of interest earned by the company, must\nbe given in charity. The contemporary Islamic Funds have termed this process\nas \"purification.\"\n\nThe Shariah scholars have different views about whether the \"purification\"\nis necessary where the profits are made through capital gains (i.e. by\npurchasing the shares at a lower price and selling them at a higher price).\nSome scholars are of the view that even in the case of capital gains the\nprocess of \"purification\" is necessary, because the market price of the\nshare may reflect an element of interest included in the assets of the\ncompany. The other view is that no purification is required if the share is\nsold, even if it results in a capital gain. The reason is that no specific\namount of price can be allocated for the interest received by the company.\nIt is obvious if all the above requirements of the halal shares are\nobserved, the most of the assets of the company are halal, and a very small\nproportion of its assets may have been created by the income of interest.\nThis small proportion is not only unknown, but also a negligible as compared\nto the bulk of the assets of the company. Therefore, the price of the share,\nin fact, is against the bulk of the assets, and not against such a small\nproportion. The whole price of the share therefore, may be taken as the\nprice of the halal assets only.\n\nAlthough this second view is not without force, yet the first view is more\ncautious and far from doubts. Particularly, it is more equitable in an\nopen-ended equity fund because if the purification is not carried out on the\nappreciation and a person redeems his unit of the Fund at a time when no\ndividend is received by it, no amount of purification will be deducted from\nits price, even though the price of the unit may have increased due to the\nappreciation in the prices of the shares held by the fund. Conversely, when\na person redeems his unit of the Fund at a time when no dividend is received\nby it, no amount of purification will be deducted from its price, even\nthough the price of the unit may have increased due to the appreciation in\nthe prices of the shares held by the fund. Conversely, when a person redeems\nhis unit after some dividends have been received in the fund and the amount\nof purification has been deducted therefrom, reducing the net asset value\nper unit, he will get a lesser price compared to the first person.\n\nOn the contrary, if purification is carried out both on dividend and capital\ngains, all the unit-holders will be treated at par with the regard to the\ndeduction of the amounts of purification. Therefore, it is not only free\nfrom doubts but also more equitable for all the unit-holders to carry out\npurification in the capital gains. This purification may be carried out on\nthe basis of an average percentage of the interest earned by the companies\nincluded in the portfolio.\n\nThe management of the fund may be carried out in two alternative ways. The\nmanagers of the Fund may act as mudaribs for the subscriber. In this case a\ncertain percentage of the annual profit accrued to the Fund may be\ndetermined as the reward of the management, meaning thereby that the\nmanagement will get its share only if the fund has earned some profit. If\nthere is no profit in the fund, the management will deserve nothing, but the\nshare of the management will increase with the increase of profits.\n\nThe second option of the management is to act as an agent for the\nsubscribers. In this case, the management may be given a pre agreed fee for\nits services. This fee may be fixed in lump sum or as a monthly or annual\nremuneration. According to the contemporary Shariah scholars, the fee can\nalso be based on a percentage of the net asset value of the fund. For\nexample, it may be agreed that the management will get 2% or 3% of the net\nasset value of the fund at the end of every financial year.\n\nHowever, it is necessary in Shariah to determine any of the aforesaid\nmethods before the launch of the fund. The practical way for this would be\nto disclose in the prospectus of the fund on what basis the fees of the\nmanagement will be paid. It is generally presumed that whoever subscribes to\nthe fund agrees with the terms mentioned in the prospectus. Therefore, the\nmanner of paying the management will be taken as agreed upon on all the\nsubscribers.\n\nIjarah Fund\n\nAnother type of Islamic Fund may be an ijarah fund. Ijarah means leasing. In\nthis fund the subscription amounts are used to purchase assets like real\nestate, motor vehicles, or other equipment for the purpose of leasing them\nout to their ultimate users. The ownership of these assets remains with the\nFund and the rentals are charged from the users. These rentals are the\nsource of income for the fund which is distributed pro rated to the\nsubscribers. Each subscriber is given a certificate to evidence his\nsubscription and to ensure his entitlement to the pro rated share in the\nincome. These certificates may be preferably called \"sukuk\" -- a term\nrecognized in the traditional Islamic jurisprudence. Since these sukuk\nrepresent the pro rated ownership of their holders in the tangible assets of\nthe fund, and not the liquid amounts or debts, they are fully negotiable and\ncan be sold and purchased in the secondary market. Anyone who purchases\nthese sukuk replaces the sellers in the pro rated ownership of the relevant\nassets and all the rights and obligations of the original subscriber are\npassed on to him. The price of these sukuk will be determined on the basis\nof market forces, and are normally based on their profitability.\n\nHowever, it should be kept in mind that the contracts of leasing must\nconform to the principles of Shariah which substantially differ from the\nterms and conditions used in the agreements of the conventional financial\nleases. The points of reference are explained in detail in my book \"Islamic\nFinance.\" However, some basic principles are summarized here: 1. The leased\nassets must have some usufruct, and the rental must be charged only from\nthat point of time when the usufruct is handed over to the lessee.\n\n2. The leased assets must be of a nature that their halal (permissible) use\nis possible.\n\n3. The lessor must undertake all the responsibilities consequent to the\nownership of the assets.\n\n4. The rental must be fixed and known to the parties right at the beginning\nof the contract. In this type of the fund the management should act as an\nagent of the subscribers and should be paid a fee for his services. The\nmanagement fee may be a fixed amount or a proportion of the rentals\nreceived. Most of the Muslim jurists are of the view that such a fund cannot\nbe created on the basis of mudarabah, because mudarabah, according to them,\nis restricted to the sale of commodities and does not extend to the business\nof services and leases. However, in the Hanbali school, mudarabah can be\naffected in services and leases also. This view has been preferred by a\nnumber of contemporary scholars.\n\nCommodity Fund\n\nAnother possible type of Islamic Funds may be a commodity fund. In the fund\nof this type the subscription amounts are used in purchasing different\ncommodities for the purpose of the resale. The profits generated by the sale\nare the income of the fund which is distributed pro rated among the\nsubscribers. In order to make this fund acceptable to Shariah, it is\nnecessary that all the rules governing the transactions and fully complied\nwith. For example:\n\n1. The commodity must be owned by the seller at the time of sale, therefore,\nshort sales where a person sells a commodity before he owns it are not\nallowed in Shariah.\n\n2. Forward sales are not allowed except in the case of salam and istisna'\n(For their full details my book \"Islamic Finance\" may be consulted).\n\n3. The commodities must be halal, therefore, it is not allowed to deal in\nwines, pork, or other prohibited materials.\n\n4. The seller must have physical or constructive possession or the commodity\nhe wants to sell. (Constructive possession includes any act by which the\nrisk of the commodity is passed on to the purchaser).\n\n5. The price of the commodity must be fixed and known to the parties. Any\nprice which is uncertain or is tied up with an uncertain event renders the\nsale invalid.\n\nIn view of the above and similar other conditions, it may easily be\nunderstood that the transactions prevalent in the contemporary commodity\nmarkets, specially in the futures commodity markets do not comply with these\nconditions. Therefore, an Islamic Commodity Fund cannot enter into such\ntransactions. However, if there are genuine commodity transactions observing\nall the requirements of Shariah, including the above conditions, a commodity\nfund may well be established. The units of such fund can also be traded in\nwith the condition that the portfolio owns some commodities at all times.\n\nMurabahah Fund\n\n\"Murabahah\" is a specific kind of sale where the commodities are sold on a\ncost-plus basis. This kind of sale has been adopted by the contemporary\nIslamic banks and financial institutions as a mode of financing. They\npurchase the commodity for the benefit of their clients, then sell it to\nthem on the basis of deferred payment at an agreed margin of profit added to\nthe cost. If a fund is created to undertake this kind of sale, it should be\na closed-end fund and its units can not be negotiable in a secondary market.\nThe reason is that in the in the case Murabahah, as undertaken by the\npresent financial institutions, the commodities are sold to the clients\nimmediately after their purchase from the original supplier, while the price\nbeing on deferred payment basis becomes a debt payable by the client.\nTherefore, the portfolio of Murabahah does not own any tangible assets,\nrather it comprises of either cash or the receivable debts, and both these\nthings are not negotiable, as explained earlier. If they are exchanged for\nmoney, it must be at par value.\n\nBai'-al-dain\n\nHere comes the question whether or not Bai'-al-dain is allowed in Shariah.\nDain means \"debt\" and Bai' means sale. Bai'-al-dain, therefore, connotes the\nsale of debt. If a person has a debt receivable from a person and he wants\nto sell it at a discount, as normally happens in the bill of exchange, it is\ntermed in Shariah as Bai'-al-dain. The traditional Muslim jurists (fuqaha')\nare unanimous on the point that Bai'-al-dain is not allowed in Shariah. The\noverwhelming majority of the contemporary Muslim scholars are of the same\nview. However, some scholars of Malaysia have allowed this kind of sale.\nThey normally refer to the ruling of Shaf'ite school wherein it is held that\nthe sale of debt is allowed, but they do not pay attention to the facts that\nthe Shaf'ite jurists have allowed it only in a case where a debt is sold on\nits par value.\n\nIn fact, the prohibition of Bai-al-dain is a logical consequence of the\nprohibition of \"riba\" or interest. A \"debt\" receivable in monetary terms\ncorresponds to money, and every transaction where money is exchanged from\nthe same denomination of money, the price must be at par value. Any increase\nor decrease from one side is tantamount to \"riba\" and can never be allowed\nin Shariah. Some scholars argue that the permissibility of Bai'-al dain is\nrestricted to a case where the debt is created through a sale of a\ncommodity. In this case, they say, the debt represents the sold commodity\nand its sale may be taken as a sale of the commodity. The arguments,\nhowever, is devoid of force. For, once the commodity is sold, its ownership\nis passed on to the purchaser and it is no longer commodity of the seller.\nWhat the seller owns is nothing other than money, therefore if he sells the\ndebt, it is no more than a sale of money and it cannot be termed by any\nstretch of imagination as the sale of the commodity. That is why this view\nhas not been accepted by the overwhelming majority of the contemporary\nscholars. The Islamic Fiqh Academy of Jeddah which is the largest\nrepresentative body of the Shariah scholars and is represented by all the\nMuslim countries, including Malaysia, has approved the prohibition of\nBai'-al-dain unanimously without a single decent.\n\nMixed Fund\n\nAnother type of Islamic Fund maybe of a nature where the subscription\namounts are employed in different types of investments, like equities,\nleasing, commodities, etc. This may be called a Mixed Islamic Fund. In this\ncase if the tangible assets of the Fund are more than 51% while the\nliquidity and debts are less than 50% the units of the fund may be\nnegotiable. However, if the proportion of liquidity and debts exceeds 50%,\nits units cannot be traded in according to the majority of the contemporary\nscholars. In this case the Fund must be a closed-end Fund."
