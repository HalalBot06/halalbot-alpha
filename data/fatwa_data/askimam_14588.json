  "question": "Here in South Africa Theres Articles in the Masjid Saying Ban the Sunday Times.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nHere in South Africa Theres Articles in the Masjid Saying Ban the Sunday Times. The Reason for this Was Because They Printed an Article On Matters Where Some Female Author Slandered The Prophet (SA.W). My Question is That the Newspaper is Not Slandering The Prophet, They are Quoting Someone With Their Names and Saying What They said. If They Hadnt done So There Was No Way I Would Have Found Out About the Story.\n\nAre They then Guilty or Not. The Notice in the Masjid Said its Waajib to Boycott the Paper. My Opinion is that It Should Be The Female Author Who Needs Education, The Papers Job is to Inform.\n\nIts Like Killing the Messenger sort Of Approach If its Waajib to Boycott the Paper.  If We Do Boycott the Paper for Example The Muslim Ummah Will Go Backwards Since Nearly All Newspapers and TV News Reports are Anti-Islamic. Everyone Knows that the Media of today is a Weapon. Rather than Boycott the Paper Comeone Could Reply to the Article in the Paper and In That way People Will find Out the Truth About Islam.\n\nI Understand and Agree to the Reasoning for Boycotting the  Isreal Supporting Company Products that Printed Out in the Masjids. However Could You Have a Column for Alternatives to the Boycotted Products, Its becoming Hard Since Nearly All Items Are There.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nIt is incorrect to state that the media is simply a messenger. That can be clearly understood by observing the prejudices in the media. The cartoon issue bears ample testimony to that. The media is also governed by the publishers liability act. Based on that, the Sunday Times was issued a restraining order from publishing the cartoons and caricatures of our beloved Rasulullah Sallallohu alaihi Wasallam. The Sunday Times even published an article stating they will be sensitive to the feelings of Muslims in their publications. If the media are mere messengers, then there is no point in the media expressing their sensitivity to Muslims. The media is known to have its agendas and its publications are designed to fulfill its agenda. Why is it that certain groups are only targeted in a specific way? What about the crimes of many others whose crimes to humanity are more serious? Why is such information not published in the same manner and attitude as Muslim news is covered and published? The media pursues its agenda and bows to the pressure of its management. It is surprising that the Sunday Times gave a written commitment to be sensitive to the Muslims during the cartoon issue in the Sunday Times and in a short span of time have published an article of a similar nature. We cannot allow the media to carry such articles or else everyday any person having hatred for Islam will write a derogative article and have the media publish the article. Consider the consequences of such articles in the context of the effect and influence of the media. After all the Apartheid Government used the media to brain wash the people and belittle the black population of . The media claims to publish inflammatory articles based on freedom of speech. Could this mean there is no limitations and restrictions on freedom of speech. Never. As Muslims we also have sensitive information about other religions. Would it be correct for us to simply publish such information based on us being informers or messengers? There has to be a level of tolerance and respect. Once that line is trespassed it will be a recipe for disaster and uproar. The Sunday Times seem to be treading on this path of disaster.  It is very unfortunate that some people have adopted a compromising stand with the Sunday Times on the cartoon issue. They claim being heard and respected. How did the Sunday Times then publish the recent derogatory article. This much for their respect to the Muslims. The approach of Jamiatul Ulamah of Natal with Sunday times has been hailed by senior Ulamah and Muslims throughout the country. Those that compromise our stand with the Sunday Times also expressed their dismay at the Sunday Times recent publication.\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
