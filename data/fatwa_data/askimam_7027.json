  "question": "What is the purpose of Masturat Jamat? Questions regarding women, Hijab and their education: Was masturat work designed for women only away from deen?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Can you please explain what is the purpose of Masturat Jamat in detail? What is the importance of Masturat Jamat? 2. A brother claimed that his wife is already very pious and there is no need for her to go out in Masturat jamat and he further claims Masturat Jamat is unimportant for pious women and only women away from Deen should go out. Is he right? Was masturat work designed for women only away from deen? 3. Which is better, a woman doing higher education (Bs. or Ms or Phd by compromising her Hijab(proda) or a woman not doing higher education because she does not want to break or compromise her Hijab(porda)? [Hijab definition to me is complete covering of women including face, wearing burkha with nikap] 4. Is it permissible for a husband to allow non-Maharam Men to enter his house and talk to his wife while he (husband) is not in the house while his wife does not do Hijab at all? Even if she did Hijab, was it allowed?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The object of Jamaat in general is to bring Deen alive in the entire world. The object of Mastooraat in particular is to bring one hundred percent of Deen alive into the lives of every single woman. This is of utmost importance, since nobody can ever be successful if he%2Fshe does not have Deen. No person can claim that he%2Fshe is pious and does not have to go in Jamaat because of his%2Fher piety. There is no end to piety. The person who claims to be pious is in reality the one who is most in need of going out in Jamaat. Jamaat is not confined to those who are far away from Deen and who are living on the streets but it it also and more important for those who are regular with their Salaat, Dhikr, Tilaawat, etc. to go out in Jamaat in order to perfect these actions, to develop devotion and concentration in Salaat and Dhikr, etc. and also to bring others (who are away from Deen) more closer to Allah Ta?ala.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Refer 1 above.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. It is Waajib for a woman to don the full Hijaab and there is no compromise in Deen. Therefore, the woman in Hijaab is far more better since she is obedient to the commands of Allah Ta?ala whilst the woman without Hijaab is violating the orders of Allah Ta?ala.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. This is totally prohibited and forbidden at all circumstances. The husband will be taken to task and is sinful to the highest degree. Even if the woman is in Hijaab, still too, under no circumstance can she be in seclusion to any non-Mahram woman.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
