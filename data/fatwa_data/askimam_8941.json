  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like to clarify the fiqh regarding the disposing of RIBA specifically : 1. Is it permissible to use RIBA money to renovate & upgrade the living quaters of my servants/maids. The living quaters is on my property. 2. Is it permissible to give RIBA monies to someone that is involved in mortgage loans and the like and is paying interest? 3. Must RIBA be given to people that are eligible for Zakaat only (implying Muslims only), or can it be given to any poor person.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nInterest monies must be given to the poor and needy who are eligible to accept Zakaat without the intention of reward. However, interest received from government institutes, e.g. post office could be used to offset government taxes. Interest received from private banks cannot be used to offset taxes. It may be used to offset interest charged from the same bank.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
