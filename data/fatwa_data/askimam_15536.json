  "question": "Urine drops leak out on my underwear after using the toilet. Can i pray in this condition?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy name is Umair and im 17 years old. I have been sufferring from an illness for 12 years now. I experience extreme pain while i am passing urine. And no matter how hard i try, i always have this feeling after using the toilet that i have not managed to fully empty my bladder. After aprox 15-20 minutes after using the toilet, a few drops of urine automatically leak into my underwear. This,  make my clothes islamically \"unpure\" and i believe it is unlawful to pray in such a state. Althoug i do try and take a bath every day, it is impossible and impractical to change my clothes after every time i use the toilet. So my question is whether it is O.K for me to pray in such a state?.  JazakAllah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nHereunder are some suggestions to overcome your difficulty.\n\n1.You should place a tissue or some absorbent in you undergarment. That will serve to absorb the urine drops. The absorbent could be disposed before making wudhu.\n\n2.The urine drops could be waswasa as also advised by Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم). This is how Shaitaan troubles a person. You should sprinkle water around your private parts and your undergarment. You could attribute the perceived wetness to the sprinkled water.\n\n3.You may even do both, use an absorbent and also sprinkle water to satisfy yourself. Dispose of the absorbent and make wudhu and perform salah. You do not  have to bath or change your undergarment.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
