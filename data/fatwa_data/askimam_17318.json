  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. What is the sunnah way of clipping hand and toe nails.\n\n2. Is it ok for females to not cover their hair infront of their mehrems (father, brothers ) while inside the house. Because I have heard that the angels dont come to such a place where females are with uncovered heads.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n \n\n1.      It is preferable to clip the finger nails in the following manner:\n\nStart with the index finger of the right hand and clip towards the little finger. Thereafter, start with the little finger of the left hand and clip towards the thumb. And finally clip the thumb nail of the right hand.\n\n \n\nA person should start clipping his toe nails from the small right toe and end at the small left toe. (Hindiyyah 5\\358)\n\n \n\nThis is not a sunnah however, it is preferable. (Ahsanul Fatawa 9\\82)\n\n \n\n2.      It is permissible for a woman to leave her hair uncovered in front of her mehrams. However, it is advisable for her to maintain modesty even in front of her male mehrams by covering her hair.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Ishaq E.
