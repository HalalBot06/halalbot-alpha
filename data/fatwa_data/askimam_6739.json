  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour situation is ambiguous and we are unable to offer any specific advice.\n\nIn general, if you are doubtful and you are unable to make a decision, you should adopt one or both of the following procedures in deciding on any matter.\n\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?That person who makes Istikhaara (seeks divine guidance) never loses and the person who makes Mashwara (consults) never regrets.? Kindly find attached our article on Istikhaara.\n\nTo make Mashwara was also a great Sunnah of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). You should identify a responsible person/s in whichever field you are in and make Mashwara. If you arrived at a decision through the above both procedures or any one procedure, place your trust in Allah and proceed. There is no reason for doubt thereafter.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
