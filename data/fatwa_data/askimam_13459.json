  "question": "I have a relative who always have marriage problem. She always argue with the husband and uses vulgar words",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a relative who always have marriage problem. She always argue with the husband and uses vulgar words\n\nWhen I ask her why she did that, she said that her husband provoke her into using those words. I just cant belived she could do such thing even how bad teh provocation is , she should not use abusive language.The Husband is a quite person who always give in to her demand . I have given her many advise and examples from Hadith etc. She has a degree in Social Studies and her husband is lower in qualification .This is her second marriage.Her first marriage ends up in Divorce due to many quarrelling and her being very arrogant\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nJazakallah for writing to the institute regarding your relative's problems.\n\nYou have spoken to the lady on several occasions and yet she still continues with her unacceptable behavior. It would appear that she lacks basic communication skills and she is unable to put her secular knowledge into practice. It is unfortunate in that she is either unwilling or unable to help herself considering this is her second marriage. How long has she been married for this time? Do you think she will write to us so that she can perhaps have an opportunity to give her side of the events? Do give her our email address and ask her to write in to us. If she is unwilling to do so then I suggest that her parents should be approached and she will have to face the elders of his family too. There is no point in allowing this type of situation to continue. She will have to go for counseling and give an undertaking to change her behavior. No man or woman should treat their spouse in this manner. Allah Ta'ala and Nabi(sallalaallahu alayhi wassallam) have given us clear guidelines as to how a married couple should conduct their relationship. Her husband must admonish her gently and tell her that she has to stop behaving in this way. He must give her exact guidelines as to what he wants her to stop doing and saying. He can also tell her that he is willing to help her to overcome this pattern of behaviour if she makes a genuine effort to stop. Insha'allah, since you say he is kind person, he will encourage any civil action of hers. Ask him to write to us for further help. May Allah Ta'ala guide both of them and help the lady to adopt acceptable patters of communication, ameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nSister Fadila\nSOCIAL DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (FATWA DEPT.)"
