  "question": "Is it permissable to buy your learners? Is it permissable to drive a car?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nEvery person who resides in a country or acquires its citizenship and enters\ninto an agreement with that government should follow the laws of that land,\ntherefore, he is under obligation to follow the laws unless a law of the\nland that compells him to do an act which is prohibited in Shariah. On the\nbasis of this principle, since smuggling is illegal, a Muslim is required to\nabide by this restriction. (Justice Mufti Taqi Usmani, Pakistan)\n\nIn view of the above, it is not permissible to offer a bribe and obtain one'\ns leaner's licence. It is permissible to drive a car and in doing so, the\ndriver must comply with the rules and principles of the Ministry of\nTransport.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
