  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs-salaamu-alaikum\n\nI recently met a girl over chat, we communicated our intentions early in the relationship that we want to get married and not date etc. We live in 2 different provinces hence we dont see each other but we keep in regular contact via. sms and phone. The girl does not work which is ok by me but my father says I should marry a girl with a career in case something happens to me. The other issue is the girl has made it very clear to me that she will not wear a scarf and will only do so in religious occasions she says she is a 'mordern' person and not 'old fashioned' and the fact that she sees other girls wearing scarfs who do wrong and give a bad name to islam, so she decided not to wear a scarf even after marriage. I tried to talk to her about it she refused and kicked a fuss about it. Before ramadaan began i saw a post on your website about talking to a significant other during ramadaan, i talked to her about it, saying that we should only talk when its necessary, she said that everything upto the current point in our relationship was not necessary etc. and basically didnt agree to what i said and cited other couples talking during ramdaan and that there was nothing wrong. Apart from that i find her to be a loving and caring individual, she supported me during difficult times, however her whole modernistic outlook which seems to be troubling me, i keep asking myself will she be good for my deen and that she will be the mother of my children, her values will be passed onto the children. The other factor is her idea of a wedding is contrary to my idea of having a simple wedding, she wants a fancy wedding. At this point i am unclear as to whether or not i should proceed with the relationship. Please advice Jazakallah\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nIt is very important for the husband and wife to have a common approach to things. It appears that the girl and you do not have a common approach. Both of you have diverse approaches. That can be problematic in a marriage. You should discuss the issue with your seniors and also make Istikhara. Do not be hasty. This is a life long decision.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
