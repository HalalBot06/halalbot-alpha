  "answer": "QUESTION\nThere have been a few shiekhs in the UK, who have said that it is permissible to rob and steal from non-muslim civilians, be they in their homes, or be they on the street, because of them being at war with us, and for the crime of being kaffir. What is the shariah ruling on this? What is your opinion on the Shariah being implemented in Nigeria? Do you know anything about the great Nigerian Mujahid Uthman Dan Fodio? How should we behave towards the non-muslim Americans and british people that we work with? I find a lot of salafis I meet to be very arrogant, they use abusive language about scholars, and groups like tabligh,asharees, Sufis, and everyone else. Is this arrogance warranted? I would like to take up further studes of Islam in the future, what is your opinion of Tarim in Yemen, and Damascus in Syria?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is not permissible to rob or steal from non-Muslims. The fact that you are staying in the country as a citizen, is a tacit agreement of compliance with the law and as though you have agreed not to harm your fellow citizens.\nYou have probably misunderstood the Shaykh.\n2. The implementation of Shari'ah is obviously a good thing wherever it may be.\n3. No, I do not know about Uthman Dan Fodio.\n4. You should behave in a courteous manner with everyone even if the others are rude to you.\n5. The abusive language of the Salafis is nothing new. It is totally wrong of them to condemn all other schools of thought and criticize them as they\nare rude to you.\n6. We salute your decision to take up Islamic studies in the future. Where you wish to study is entirely up to you. It depends on a number of factors.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
