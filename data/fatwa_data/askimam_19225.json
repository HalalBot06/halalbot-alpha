  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI work in an insurance company, please let me know if it is haram?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\n \n\nConventional insurance schemes are prohibited as they have interest, gambling and uncertainty (gharar) in them, all of which are prohibited. Working for an insurance scheme will therefore fall in the category of assisting in sin. Allah Taala says:\n\n \n\n \n\nوَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ\n\nAnd do not assist in sin\n\n(Qur’an 5:2)\n\n \n\nFurthermore, the salary for services rendered to an insurance scheme will not be halaal as the payment will be from a haram source.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\n \n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
