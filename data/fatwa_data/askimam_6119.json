  "question": "Which nikah's meher is applicable, the 1st meher or the 2nd meher?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy friend's friend have nikah 2nd time with same girl to show thier relatives and ppl. The 1st nikah performed some time ago and the meher was set in court some thousand in rupees. now the meher in 2nd nikah has set some laks in rupees.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe concept of two Nikahs has no basis in Shari'ah. The first Nikah will be\nvalid if the conditions of the Nikah were fulfilled. The Mahr stipulated at\nthe first Nikah must be given.\n\nIn principle, if the husband increased the Mahr amount after the Nikah and\nafter consummation, then the increased amount must be given. (Qudoori). The\nincrease must be offered by him. It cannot be imposed upon him.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
