  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI stay in new jersey, USA.. I work in a gas station from 2pm to 12am so there is a problem for me for the asar and magrib prayers as there is no break in between at all.. well, nothing before prayers, so I take a jaanimaaz with me to the station in my bag and just as soon as the rush ends quite a time, i take jaanimaaz and run at the back of the station where Alhamdulillah there is some place and i just offer farz prayers and come back.. My problem is, there is no water facility in the gas station, there is one basin that too in toilet and i dont like to wadhu there and moreover no time though.. and so i try to be in wadhu from 2 to 6:30.. but as soon as winters will start in usa, it will not be possible so i just wanted to know wheather can i do TAIMUM instead? and also there is nothing like mud over there, so can i just with air? and also i wanted to know wheather offering prayers behind the station would be ok or not? as the place is not so clean but i thought that if jaanimaaz is there, then no problem! please help me with this issue brother, i will be very greatful...

Alhamdulillah your concern for your salaah is praiseworthy. May Allah accept your efforts and make it easy for you.\n\n2. No, Since water is available, you are ot allowed to perform Tayammum.\n\n3. You may perform your Salaah behind the Gas station on your jaanimaaz, However endeavour to perform it away from Najasat.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
