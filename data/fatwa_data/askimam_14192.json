  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it correct that Abu Yusuf said :\n\nWhen the takbir for qunut in witr is said one should raise his hands in the manner as raising for dua (thus not like when starting prayer) and reading in this position the qunut.(keeping the hands raised)\n\nIs this correct?And can this practiced\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe context of your question is when a Hanafi is performing Fajr Salaat in Jamaat with a Shaafi’e Imaam. The Shaafi’ee [unlike Hanafis] are proponents of Qunoot in Fajr (after Ruku). Therefore, according to Imaam Abu Yusuf [ra], if a Shaafi’ee Imaam recites Qunoot in Fajr Salaat, then a Hanafi [Muqtadi] should follow him. However, the official ruling of the Hanafi Madhab is that the Hanafi follower should remain standing quietly. (Bahr vol.2 pg.44; Rashidiyah)\n\nIn Witr Salaat, the Hanafis recite Qunoot before Ruku (Shaafi’ees after Ruku). This Qunoot is preceded by a Takbir with raising of the hands to the earlobes. This Takbir is Waajib (compulsory) and if committed, the Salaat will have to be repeated. (Tabyeen vol.1 pg.425; Ilmiyah). The Shaafi’ees do not recite this Takbeer. They merely raise their hands (like in Du’aa) for the Qunoot after Ruku. If a Hanafi adopts this view, he will have to repeat his Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
