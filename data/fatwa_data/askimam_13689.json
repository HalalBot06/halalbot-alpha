  "question": "given the recent situation in Natal regarding severe blood shortages, would it be permissible for muslims to 'pitch in' and donate blood.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1.I understand that it is not permissible for a muslim to donate blood as a regular blood donor. However, given the recent situation in Natal regarding severe blood shortages, would it be permissible for muslims to 'pitch in' and donate blood. Many muslims may also need blood transfusions over the holiday period, when people tend to travel more and accidents become more common.\n\n2. Is it permissible to use a live fish as bait?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Refer below our standard reply to similar queries.\n\n2. It is not permissible to use live bait for fishing.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\nQ: Can Muslims donate/transfuse blood?\n\nA: It is permissible to donate and transfuse blood if:\n\na) There is a desperate need to donate blood; b) There is no other alternative; and c) This has been prescribed by an expert medical practitioner.\n\nThis permissibility is based on the principal of ‘necessity relaxes prohibition’. (Al-Ashbaah).\n\nHowever, the permissibility of blood donation and blood transfusion is determined by the following conditions:\n\na) The donor willingly donates his blood. If he is compelled to do so, it will not be permissible; b) There is no danger to his (the donor’s) life or health; c) If the doctor feels that the patient will lose his life and there is no other alternative but recourse of blood transfusion; and d) There is no fear of death but the recovery is not possible without blood transfusion.\n\nIt is not permissible to sell one’s blood or to pay the blood donor. However, if one is in need of blood desperately and the only means to obtain the blood is to purchase it, then only will it be permissible to pay for the blood.\n\nNB. Blood donation and blood transfusion is not permissible for the sake of beautification or for any other reason other than genuine necessity."
