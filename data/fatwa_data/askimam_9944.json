  "answer": "QUESTION\n2. hijaab less women how much get punishment 3. man stairing at hijaab less woman how much he gets punishment plz give me answer in detail that I make convince others.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. These are two separate issues; rape and the lack of Hijaab. The rapist will be punished for his heinous crime whilst the woman will be sinful not for rape, but for failure to observe the rules of Hijaab. Failure to wear Hijaab in no way justifies the heinous crime of rape.\n\n2. Women who wear revealing clothing, according to the Ahadith, won?t even smell the fragrance of Jannah.\n\n3. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have declared, ?Allah?s curse is on the one who looks (at stange women) and upon the one who is looked at (the woman who reveal herself unnecessarily to others).? (Mishkaat vol.2 pg.270)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
