  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI know according to Hanafi School all sea animal are Makrooh or Haram except Fish (as it is a Vertebra but according to other three Madhaahibs all sea creatures are Halal.\n\nIn case of Prawn Hanafi consider it Makrooh but Crab is considered to be Haram.Sometime I have Prawn ( I am Hanafi)  considering it Makrooh of low level due to other Madhaahibs considering it Halal, but in case of Crab I am very confuse as one Madhaahibs is saying it is Halal and other and saying it is Haram.\n\n would like to see duleel from both side from Qura’an and Hadeeths. I am interested to see what Qura’anic verse or what hadeeths has been used for my knowledge. Is it possible for you to provide me this information?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAt the outset, it is of paramount importance that you change your attitude or approach in following the laws of Shariah. You state that you are Hanafi, and eat prawns since the other Madhaahib permit it. This is extremely dangerous and harmful to your Deen. If you are adherent of the Hanafi Madhab, you should follow the Hanafi rulings in totality. Drifting from one Madhab to the other according to your desire and wish is incorrect.\n\nIt is prohibited to eat crabs. Therefore you should follow the Hanafi ruling and restrict yourself to that. There is no need to look at the rulings of other Madhaahibs. You may refer to the book Hayatul Hayawaan by Allamah Damiri for further reading.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai\nStudent: Darul Ifta\n\nChecked and Approved: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
