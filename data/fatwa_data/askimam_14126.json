  "question": "Our relation will be over if you won’t get right by 10 of this month\" Q: Do these words affect my Nikah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nTwo weeks before we argued with each other. I lost my temper and said to my wife: \"Our relation will be over if you won’t get right by 10 of this month\" Q: Do these words affect my Nikah?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nTalaaq (divorce) is a serious matter. It is not a matter to be taken lightly or rush into. With regard to Talaaq pending on some future event, the validity of the Talaaq is based upon the condition being found. Hence, when the condition is found, Talaaq will take place.\n\nIn the above case, i.e. our relation will be over if you won’t get right by the 10th of this month, if one intends one Talaaq and the condition is found, one Talaaq-e-Baain (irrevocable Talaaq) will take place and if one intends 3 Talaaqs, then 3 Talaaqs will taken place. However, if one did not intend Talaaq, then no Talaaq will take place. (Muheetul Burhaan vol.4 pg.420; Idaratul Qur’aan)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
