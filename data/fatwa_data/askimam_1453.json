Please help solve this problem. How does one manage relationship with one's Maternal uncle's wife as she is required to do purdah with me. How to do purdah and still maintain relationship with cousins (female) that are required to do purdah? Does requirement of doing purdah with a relative mean that one does not ever speak or visit their house? Please help by explaining. I understand that breaking relations are considered Haraam and great sin in Islam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo maintain family ties is an order repeatedly mentioned in the Quran and\nAhadith of Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam). To severe family ties\nis\na major sin.\n\nYou should apply wisdom and diplomacy with relatives who do not adhere to\nthe laws of Shariah, for example, do not maintain purdah or work at banks\netc. and reform them. Disassociating from them is not the solution to\nsuch problems.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti E Desai\nFatwa Dept."
