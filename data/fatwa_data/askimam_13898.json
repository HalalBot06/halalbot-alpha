  "question": "If both husband and wife are working in governments offices and if one of them had hired a house then his/her spouse cannot get the House Rent, which in normal circumstances is paid to the employee if the employee didnt hire the house",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am working in a semi government office under federal government in Islamabad. My wife is teaching in a federal college. I have hired a house whose rent is paid by my office where i am working. If an employee doesnt hire the house he gets some amount under the head House Rent.\n\nIn Islamabad the rents of the house are far above the limit of the rent paid by the government and one has to pay the difference from his own pocket.\n\nAs far as the rules are concerned If both husband and wife are working in governments offices and if one of them had hired a house then his/her spouse cannot get the House Rent, which in normal circumstances is paid to the employee if the employee didnt hire the house. As per the rule mentioned above if my wife hides the information regarding the hiring of house and takes the House Rent, then what is the ruling of shariah regarding that amount of House Rentwhich wife will take. Is it hala, haram or makrooh?\n\nSecondly as far the medical facilities are concernd if one is governments employee he get some medical facilities which are also availble to his dependents. IF his wife is govenment empoyee, then she cannot avail those facilities as all the governmet office do have provided medical facilities to its employees. \n\nNow in my case the medical facilities provided by my wifes' college are not good. Now if she only avails the facilities given by my office and does not avail those of her college, then will it be valid as there is lot of difference between the standard of facilities. Will it be valid?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to the contractual agreement with the government, it is not permissible for your wife to claim for house and rent benefits. It is also not permissible for her to claim for medical benefits as your dependant.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
