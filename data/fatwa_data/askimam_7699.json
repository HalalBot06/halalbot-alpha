  "answer": "QUESTION\ni want to know the background and tashreeh of the above Hadith...\"Hadith rejectors\" says that this Hadith is fabricated and it is contradict from Quran...please reply as soon as possible...\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere were eight people who pretended to accept Islam when they fell ill in Madina Munawwara, Rasulullah(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised them to live in the outskirts of Madina Munawwara and drink the milk and urine of camels as a means of cure. After being cured they brutally killed the shepard and drove the camels along with them. The punishment was in lieu of the crime committed by these murderers as well as to set an example to others in particular the Jews who used to stay on the outskirts of Medina Munawwara and were arch enemies of the Muslims. %0D%0A%0D%0AThis Hadith has been recorded by many of the Imaams of Hadith in their respective books. From among them are: Imaam Bukhari and Imaam Muslim is their Sahih.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs it is mentioned in the narration itself, this was prescribed by Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) as a cure for illness that had afflicted those people. This Hadith is used as proof for the permissibility of usage of such medication which may contain any Haraam ingredients. %0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, the usage of such a medicine will only be permissible when there is no other treatment available which does not include such ingredients, as was the case in this instance. (See Fathul Baari vol.1 pg.441). This is also manifest from the Aayat of the Qur'aan, 'And he has explained to you in detail what is forbidden for you except under compulsion of circumstances.'
