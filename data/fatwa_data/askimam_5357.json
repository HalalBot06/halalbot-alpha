  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu'alaikum Wr. WB. 1. What kind of toys can we give for our children? 2. Are we allowed to sell things, and leave the box for money in its side (There is no buyer, seller and akad)? 3. Do you know any Shafee website we can trust ? 4. Can we dress up our children with a shirt / cloth with animal/ cartoon pictures in it?? 5. Can we perform jima' while our baby sleeping next to us ? Would there be any effect to the baby? thank\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Generally toys that do not have any animate pictures or are not shaped in%0D%0Aan animate form (like dolls) may be given to children. Dolls may be given if%0D%0Athe head is removed.%0D%0A2. Your question is vague, please explain in more detail.%0D%0A3. Unfortunately, we are not aware of any reliable Shaafi'ee website. You%0D%0Amay contact Sheikh Taha at mt_k%40hotmail.com%0D%0A4. Pictures of animate objects like cartoons are Haraam. One may not dress%0D%0Achildren in such clothing.%0D%0A5. It is best not to make Jimaa in the presence of a sleeping baby. However,%0D%0Aif it is unavoidable, they baby should be positioned in a manner that should%0D%0Ahe%2Fshe wake up, he%2Fshe will not see the act of Jimaa. If a baby sees the act%0D%0Aof Jimaa, this will create immodesty in the child even though at this age,%0D%0Ait does not realize what Jimaa is. If the child is sleeping, it will not%0D%0Ahave an effect on the child.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Imraan Vawda%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
