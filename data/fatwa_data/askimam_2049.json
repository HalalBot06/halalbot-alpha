Okay, my mother went to Bangladesh, and there are a lot of poor children over there. I thought that the poor children would be happy with toys and dolls and whatever I did not need, so I gave them all away but now I am 1)wondering if it was wrong? 2)I would like to know why are dolls bad? Can you give me hadth or any proof. 3)I am now, also wondering is it wrong to give non-islamic clothing away to the poor, like short sleeved shirts or tight pants or tight shirts? 4)do you have to pay your zakat in the country you are living in or can you pay your zakat where ever you want? I would like to make a request would you please answer all my questions in detail, and with hadth or proof from the Qur'an. Thank you very much for your time.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Photography - refer below%0D%0AIt is not permissible to give the dolls or any gamers having pictures of%0D%0Aanimate objects to any person.%0D%0A2. Short sleeves, tights, etc. can be given to the poor. They, in%0D%0Aparticular, females should be advised to cover the tight fitting parts with%0D%0Aloose tops.%0D%0A3. Zakaat must be calculated according to the value of the area one is%0D%0Aresiding. It is desirable to distribute the Zakaat locally but if there is a%0D%0Agreater need elsewhere, it can be given there as well.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0APicture frames and photographs of animate objects are not permissible to%0D%0Adisplay. Frames having pictures of inanimate objects e.g. trees, mountains,%0D%0Aetc. are permissible.%0D%0A- Hadhrat Abu Talha (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) narrates that Nabi (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'Angels do not enter a house wherein there is a dog%0D%0Aor picture.' (Mishk%E3t vol. 2 p. 385)%0D%0A? %C1bdullah ibn Mas%F3od (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) narrates that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'The people with the most severe%0D%0Apunishment by Allah will be the picture makers.' (Ibid).%0D%0A? Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (RA) narrates, 'I heard the messenger of Allah saying,%0D%0A\"Every picture-maker will be in the fire. A life will be created for every%0D%0Apicture the picture-maker made, and he will be tortured in Hell.\"%0D%0AIf you have to make pictures (says Ibn Abbaas) then make a picture of a tree%0D%0Aor such things which are inanimate.' (Bukhari and Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, if the frames are of inanimate objects but containing verses of the%0D%0ANoble Qur%E3n, Hadith and names of Allah Ta%E3la then extreme caution must be%0D%0Ataken where these frames are hung. If hung at home in the lounge or sitting%0D%0Aroom then due respect should be shown by not using vulgar language or%0D%0Asmoking there.%0D%0A"
