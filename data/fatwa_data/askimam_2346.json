  "question": "Who inherits my wealth if I die as I don't have sisters or brothers am unmarried?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Hazrath, I am the only child of my parents and my father has died. I am unmarried. My mother also has some wealth. If in case, I die now who will inherit my wealth? If my mother dies (may Allah prolong her hayath) and I too die before marrying, who will inherit our wealth? After marriage, before we beget a son, if I die does all the wealth is inherited by the wife? jazakallahu Khairan\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn the case of your mother being your only heir, she will inherit the entire estate. If you have any paternal male relatives (e.g. father's brother, father;s father, father's brothers's sons, etc) your mother will inherit 1/3 of the Estate. The remainder being inherited by the forementioned relatives. When a person is succeeded by none other than his wife, she will inherit the entire estate. In an Islamic state, when a person dies leaving no heirs, his estate will go to the Baytul Maal (treasury) and will be used for the benefit of the Muslims. In a secular state, a person is advised to make a will or bequest toward some Islamic benefit, in the absence of which, his estate will become government property. and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai FATWA DEPT."
