  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamu alaykum, I am a female that follows the shafee madhab and my husband follows the hanafi school. It has never been an issue and in fact still isn't. However I recently read in the reliance of the traveller that for shafis a woman has to have a wali for her nikah irrespective if she has been married before and that without a wali such nikah in invalid. I'm a widow that married without a wali even tho' family members were present(my father and maternal uncle). Is my nikah correct/ valid even tho i entered into it myself.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nWe issue rulings according to the Hanafi school of thought. You may refer your query to a Shafi Mufti for a ruling. Shaikh Taha in Cape Town may be consulted at mt_k@hotmail.com .\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa, Madrassah In'aamiyyah"
