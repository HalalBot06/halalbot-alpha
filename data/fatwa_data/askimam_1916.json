  "question": "When it is said 'The seven earths and the seven heavens', what does that mean exactly?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have heard 2 meaning of the seven earths. One being that there are seven layers, and the second being that there are many galaxies in the universe, and like yours is the milkyway, there are 6 others where there is a place like earth and people live on them. I accept this one, but I would like to know more on these topics Inshallah. Jazakallah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBoth the above views have been mentioned by the Mufassireen.\n\nIn brief, neither the Qur'aan nor the Ahaadith have given any clear\ndescription of the seven earths. This itself shows that this is not an\narticle of faith, for had it been, then surely Allah Ta'ala and His Rasul\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) would have clarified the matter.\n\nFor us, it is sufficient to believe that there are 7 earths, and that Allah\nTa'ala knows what form they are. There are millions or billions of secrets\nand mysteries of the universe which we do not know, nor are we required to\ndelve therein. This is just one of them. We leave these affairs to the\nknowledge of Allah Ta'ala.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
