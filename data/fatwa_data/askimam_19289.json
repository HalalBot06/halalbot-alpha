  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy Mother passed away seven months ago. I loved her alot. Once it happened that i asked her that i want to keep full beard and Imama on head. She said its o.k but please do it once you are married. What do you say now. I am still not married but i will be in two years or three INSHA-ALLAH thanks and i will wait for your answer\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssal훮mu `alaikum Warahmatull훮hi Wabrakatuh,\n\n1) If one has a beard, he should let it grow until the span of his fist. It is prohibited for one to cut or trim his beard before it reaches the span of his fist. If ones beard is beyond the span of his fist, it is permissible to trim only that amount.\n\n2) To tie an amamah is sunnah. It is not compulsory.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'훮la Knows Best,\n\nMuft카 Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
