  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan you tell me the Sunnah procedure of marriage? What should one do and what should one abstain from, e.g., not to use camera’s and take videos. Stop asking money for Jodha which the girls’ side gives for blazer.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\n \n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\nNikāh is a Sunnah of all the Prophets and in particular a Sunnah of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.\n\nNikāh is a great form of worship and it is a means of attaining piety, reward and closeness to Allah Ta’ala.\n\nعن عائشة قالت قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم: \"النكاح من سنتى فمن لم يعمل بسنتى فليس منى\"\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Aishah Radhi Allahu Anha that Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said, “Nikah is from amongst my Sunnah, and whosoever does not follow my Sunnah, is not from me.[1]\n\nIn principle, an ibādah (worship) should be performed with sincerity and strictly according to the commandments of Shari῾ah and the Sunnah of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.\n\nThe procedure of Nikāh is very simple. It is performed with a proposal (Iejāb) by the male or female and acceptance (Qubool) by the male or female in the past tense and in the presence of at least two male Muslim witnesses or one male witness and two female witnesses. \n\nIt is Sunnah that the marriage be announced and performed in the Masjid and the bride is represented by her Mahram (Unmarriageable relative like father, brother, etc.). The bride gives consent to her representative (Wakeel) in the presence of two witnesses to perform her marriage in the Masjid.\n\nAt the Masjid, the Wakeel represents the bride in the presence of the two witnesses and the stipulated dowry.[2]\n\nThe Mahr (dowry) is the woman's right and should be stipulated prior to the marriage.[3]\n\nAfter consummating the marriage, to do walimah is Sunnah and it holds within great reward.[4]\n\nIt is most unfortunate that today many marriages are void of barakah (divine blessings). There is so much turbulence and grief in marriages. One of the major contributing factors to that is extravagance in our marriages. Travelling to far place just so that the color of the toothpick matches the tablecloth, wedding cards, mehendi ceremonies, visiting beauty parlors, decorating the hall, photography, etc. are some of the many unislamic practices that have crept in our marriages.\n\nIn aping Western methods sheepishly, Muslims have adopted many disagreeable customs, innovations and forbidden practices associated with wedding which are un-Islamic and frowned upon. Some are mentioned hereunder:\n\n1. It is totally un-Islamic for those, who do not possess the means, to incur debts in order to have grandiose weddings.\n\n2. It is fallacy to think that one's respect will be lost if one does not hold an extravagant wedding and invite many people.\n\n3. The present day practice of intermingling of the genders is an act of sin and against Shari῾ah.\n\n4. Customs which are contrary to the teachings and the laws of Shari῾ah are prohibited (as mentioned in the query).\n\n5. Great care must be taken as regards to Salāh on occasions of marriage by all - the bride, the bridegroom and all the participants.\n\n6. The unnecessary expenses incurred by the bride's family in holding a feast have no basis in Shari῾ah.\n\n7. In Walimah whatever is easily available should be fed to the people and care should be taken that there is no extravagance, ostentation and that no debts are incurred in the process.\n\nAfter observing the life of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, we come to a conclusion that Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam lived a very simple and down to earth life. His marriage was simple, also was the marriage of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam’s beloved daughter.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Zaid M Shelia,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChicago, Illinois (USA)\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net\n\n\n\n\n[1]  ابن ماجه 1/592 دار إحياء الكتب العربية\n\n[2]  وأما ركن النكاح فهو الإيجاب والقبول. وذلك بألفاظ مخصوصة، أو ما يقوم مقام اللفظ..بدائع الصنائع 2/229 دار الكتب العلمية\n\nقال:النكاح ينعقد بالإيجاب والقبول بلفظين يعبر بهما عن الماضي.\n\nقال:ولا ينعقد نكاح المسلمين إلا بحضور شاهدين حرين عاقلين بالغين مسلمين رجلين أو رجل وامرأتين عدولا كانوا أو غير عدول أو محدودين في القذف.. الهداية1/185 دار احياء التراث العربي بيروت\n\n[3]  ثم المهر واجب شرعا إبانة لشرف المحل.. الهداية1/198 دار احياء التراث العربي بيروت\n\n[4]  وَاخْتُلِفَ في إجَابَةِ الدَّعْوَةِ قال بَعْضُهُمْ وَاجِبَةٌ لَا يَسَعُ تَرْكُهَا وَقَالَتْ الْعَامَّةُ هِيَ سُنَّةٌ وَالْأَفْضَلُ أَنْ يُجِيبَ إذَا كانت وَلِيمَةً وَإِلَّا فَهُوَ مُخَيَّرٌ وَالْإِجَابَةُ أَفْضَلُ لِأَنَّ فيها إدْخَالَ السُّرُورِ في قَلْبِ الْمُؤْمِنِ كَذَا في التُّمُرْتَاشِيِّ.. الفتاوى الهندية5/343 دار الفكر"
