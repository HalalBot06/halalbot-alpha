Shaytaan decorates sins in many ways and creates false excuses to legalize Haraam. You should sincerely seek forgiveness for what you have done and ensure never to repeat that act in future.\n\n \n\nRasulullah صلى الله عليه وسلم  said “Surah Fatiha is a cure for all ailments”. If you read Surah Fatiha with the correct Yaqeen (belief) and full reliance on Allah, surely, Allah will cure you.\n\n \n\nسنن الدارمى - (ج 10 / ص 305(\n\nدَّثَنَا قَبِيصَةُ أَخْبَرَنَا سُفْيَانُ عَنْ عَبْدِ الْمَلِكِ بْنِ عُمَيْرٍ قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ -صلى الله عليه وسلم- :« فَاتِحَةُ الْكِتَابِ شِفَاءٌ مِنْ كُلِّ دَاءٍ »\n\n \n\nYou should also consider consulting an appropriate physician.\n\nAnd Allah knows best \n\n \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
