  "question": "Does the following scenario result in talaaq? Secondly, can an employee who resigns prematurely be fined?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1.      When we go in Masturath Jamaat , most of the time men will deliver Bayan’s (lecture) to women, if suppose Saad is giving Bayan to women’s and in women’s group Saads wife is listening, while in the BayanSaad says ‘merimaaen or behno’ (o my mothers and sisters), what will be the ruling between Saad and his wife?\n\n2.      I was working for MNC for about 9.5 years, I resigned it in 19thJuly 2011 and I relived from it on the 23rdJuly, but just 8 months before I resigned from the company, HRD made a policy that when employee resigns he has to stay for 2 months ( notice period) or if employee wants immediate relive he has to pay 2 months’ salary to the company, if the company terminates employee its same 2 months’ notice or 2 months’ salary paid to employee, earlier it was onlyone month no payment of salary was mentioned, with this  new agreement none of the employees were happy but the management took the signature to this agreement forcefully, they made it mandatory.\n\nWhen I relived from the company they didn’t pay me the one month salary, so now only one month salary was due from my side, now I am working for some other organization and my salary is less than what I use to get in the previous company, the reason I left the first company is only due to obstacle in leading Sharia life, now my question is whether I need to pay this one month salary to the company? I am not finding justice in this, since I worked 9.5 years to this company, I should been getting reward from the company, but instead I need to pay out my company, my company relived me by giving certificate saying resignation accepted and I relived on the 23rd. I am planning to put a message to the company saying to give concession or regret this due, please clarify.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykumwaRahmatullahiWabarakatoh\n\n \n\n1.      When Saad is addressing women, the statement “merimaaen or behno” is general. He is not referring specifically to his wife.\n\n \n\nيجب أن تعلم بأنّ ركن الظهار تشبيه منكوحته بظهر أمّه، بأن يقول لامرأته: أنتِ عليّ كظهر أمّي، فإنه لا يصح الظاهر؛ لأنّ حكم الظاهر ثبت بالنصّ والنصّ خاص في حقّ المنكوحات،\n\nالمحيط البرهانى– ج 5 – ص 186 – ادارة القران\n\n \n\nقَالُوا لَوْ كَرَّرَ مَسَائِلَ الطَّلَاقِ بِحَضْرَةِ زَوْجَتِهِ وَيَقُولُ أَنْتِ طَالِقٌ وَلَا يَنْوِي لَا تَطْلُقُ\n\nالبحر الرائق شرح كنز الدقائق–ج 3 – ص 258 – 259 – ايج ايم سعيد\n\n \n\nفتاوى رحمييه – ج 8 – ص 265 – دار الاشاعت\n\n \n\n2.      The condition to pay two month salary if you resign early is incorrect.
