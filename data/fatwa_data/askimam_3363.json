  "question": "Self defence in Islam. When a kufaar attacks you (eg robbery, muggings, burglary), should you hand over your possessions without a struggle? Is it permissible to carry weapons?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected mufti saheb, my question is regarding self defence in islam. 1) i have heard differing opinions on what is allowed in shariah when a kufaar attacks you (eg robbery, muggings, burglary). Some say you should hand over your possessions without a struggle , but others say that you can kill him out of self defence. for example what should a muslim do if 5 kufaar surround him demanding money? should he run , should he hand over his money , or should he fight till the end? 2) also is it permissible to carry weapons around with you for self defence? and if so which type of weapons? jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Fight to protect your wealth.' (Hidaaya)\n\nIn view of this Hadith, a person should endeavour to protect his wealth to\nthe best of his ability by even carrying self-defence weapons. However, if\none is unable to do so, he should not risk his life at the expense of\nprotecting his wealth.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
