  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSubject:           First Azan for Jumu’ah Prayer\n\nAssalamo Alaikum,\n\nThe first Azan for Jumu'ah prayer, which is called ahead of the Azan called before the Khutba in front of the Khateeb was introduced by Uthman (3rd khalifa rashid), Radi-Allahu Anhu. It was introduced to make the people aware of the time of Jumu'ah prayer so they could make the necessary preparation and could reach the masjid in time. The first Azan was not called from the masjid at that time rather it was called at a busy place like a market so more people could hear it.  \n\n \n\nIn muslim countries these days, the first Azan for Jumu'ah prayer is called from the masjid on speakers instead of a market or any other busy place. As a lot of people can hear the Azan from the speaker, the objective for which it was started is achieved. But in our masjid in Winnipeg, , the sound of Azan does not leave the masjid even when the Azan is called by using speakers. So on Jumu'ah, first Azan is only heard by a few people who have already come into the masjid for Jumu'ah salat. So the first Azan does not even serve the objective for which it was introduced. My question is, in this situation only, will it be right to go back to the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (Sall-Allahu Alaihi Wasallam) and the Sunnah of Abu Baker (1st khalifa rashid) and Umar (2nd khalifa rashid) Radi-Allahu Anhum of calling only one Azan (the second Azan) for Jumu'ah prayer?\n\nOur imam has now started the practice of calling only one Azan (2nd azan) before Jumu'ah prayer but a few people are opposing it. They insist; the Sahabah at the time of Uthman (3rd khalifa rashid), had a consensus (Ijmaah) on two Azans and therefore, it must continue. While our imam says; there was never a consensus (Ijmaah) among Sahabah on calling two azans from the masjid for Jumu'ah prayer and the first azan does not serve its purpose when called from our masjid so we should go back to the sunnah of the prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam).\n\nI would really appreciate if you could provide me guidance/fatwa in this regard to clarify the situation. May Allah Subhana Wata'alah reward you with His blessings.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAllah Ta’ala chose our beloved Rasullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) to be the final Prophet.  He also chose the Sahabah to be the companions of Rasullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam).  Allah Ta’ala has made the Sahabah role models and examples for the Ummah.  Allah Ta’ala says in the Qur’an:\n\nوَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ آَمِنُوا كَمَا آَمَنَ النَّاسُ قَالُوا أَنُؤْمِنُ كَمَا آَمَنَ السُّفَهَاءُ أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ السُّفَهَاءُ وَلَكِنْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ\n\nWhen they (the hypocrites) are told, “Believe like the people (Sahabah) believe,” they say, “Should we believe like the fools believe?”  Behold! It is they (the hypocrites) who are indeed the fools, but they do not know it. (Al-Baqarah 13)\n\nThose that resemble the Sahabah are on Al-Sirat Al-Mustaqeem (the straight path.)  And those that deviate from the ways of Sahabah are deviating from the straight path.  Rasullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) has said:\n\nعن عبد الله رضي الله عنه عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال خير الناس قرني ثم الذين يلونهم ثم الذين يلونهم ثم يجيء أقوام تسبق شهادة أحدهم يمينه ويمينه شهادته\n\nAbdullah (Radhiyallahu Anhu) narrates that Rasullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) said, “the best of people are those from my generation, then those follow them, then those that follow them.  Then there will come such people that witness will precede their oath and their oath will precede their witness.\n\nIt is through the Sahabah that Deen reached us.  They sacrificed everything they had for the pleasure of Allah and his Rasool (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam).  They were with Rasullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) day and night, eating with Rasullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam), walking with Rasullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam), memorizing the blessed words that come out from the lips of Rasullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam).  They understood the character and temperament of Rasullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam).  Rasullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) was more beloved to them then themselves and their families.  Their understanding of Shariah was based on what Rasullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) taught them and they taught the people that came after and so on.  Their actions are not mere opinions which we can sit down and choose which to follow and which not to follow.  Their actions itself is a proof for us and necessary upon us to follow.  Rasullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) has said:\n\n \n\nعليكم بسنتي وسنة الخلفاء الراشدين المهديين عضوا عليها بالنواجذ\n\nUpon you (is incumbent) my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Khulafa Al-Rashideen.  Hold firmly on to it. (Ibn Majh, Ahmed,Al-Bayhaqi, Al-Hakim, Al-Tabrani, Al-Darami, Ibn Hibban, Tahawi,)\n\nIbn Masood (Radhiyallahu Anhu) says:\n\nمن كان مستنا فليستن بمن قد مات فان الحى لا تؤمن عليه الفتنة اوليك اصحاب محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم كانوا افضل هذه الامة ابرها قلوبا واعمقها علما واقلها تكلفا اختارهم الله لصحبة نبيه ولاقامة دينه فاعرفوا لهم فضلهم واتبعواهم على اثرهم وتمسكوا بما استطعتم من اخلاقهم وسيرهم فانهم كانوا على الهدى المستقيم (رواه رزين كذا فى مشكوة المصابيح)\n\nWhosoever is going to adopt a way, they should adopt the way of those that passed away from this world.  For verily those that are alive are not saved from fitna.  They (those that passed) are the Companions of the Muhammad (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam).  They are the most noble from this Ummah.  They were the most pure from the heart, deep in knowledge, and less in formalities.  Allah chose them for the companionship of his Nabi (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) and for upliftment of his Deen.  So recognize their status and follow their footsteps.  And inculcate in you their character and lifestyle to the best of your abilities.  They were on the straight guidance. (Razeen as mentioned in Mishkat Al-Masabeeh)\n\nWe should hold firm to the ways of the Sahabah whether we understand them or not.  In following their ways lays our salvation.\n\nThere are many issues which were not present in the time of Rasullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam).  The Khulafa Al-Rashideen understood the importance of such issues and introduced them and the Ummah at large accepted it and followed upon.  For example, the compilation of the Holy Qur’an in to one book was not done in the time of Rasullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam). It was compiled later in the time of the Righteous Kulafah and the Sahabah unanimously agreed upon it.   Likewise, when the city of Madinah grew and the boundaries spread, there was a need for an additional Azaan for Jummah to call people from their works so that they may come on time to the Masjid for the Khutbah. Uthman (Radhiyallahu Anhu) introduced this Azaan and all the Sahabah agreed and no one disagreed to it.  The Sahabah were such that they could not stand the sight of innovation or something done contrary to the method of the Prophet.  Their remaining silent and accepting is Ijma on this matter.  The Fuquha have expounded on the importance of those injuctions deduced through Ijma (consensus).  In some instances it is equivalent to Qatiyyat (absolute ruling) like a mutawatir Hadith or a verse of the Qur’an.\n\nThe Masjid trustees should try utmost to keep this practice alive in their Masajid.  One might argue that the reason for the first Azaan was to inform the masses residing some distance from the Masjid, making it possible for them come for Jummah in time for the Khutbah of Jummah and this purpose is not being achieved.  But in reality it can still be achieved even though it is not given out loud on the speaker.  If the people were to know that the first Azaan is on a certain time via the Masjid notice board, announcements, etc., people will keep this into consideration and reach the Masjid in due time before the Khutbah.  Despite what the reasons may be, one should still practice on this Sunnah of the Sahabah hand not deviate from their Sunnah.  There is always barakah and blessings in following and adhering to the Sunnah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
