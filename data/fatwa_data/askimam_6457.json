  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf DAJJAAL were to be here would shooting him do any harm to him, what I mean is could anyone kill him with a knife or a gun or another similar weapon?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn theory, it is possible to kill Dajjaal as he would be a human being.\n\nHowever, Eesa (Alayhis salaam) will be given the exclusive right to kill\nhim. So, even if others try to kill Dajjaal, they will not succeed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
