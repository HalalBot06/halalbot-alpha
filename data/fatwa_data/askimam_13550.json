  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSalaams to you all.  I started my period last Monday and it finished on Sunday.  On Monday i had to go into hospital for a small procedure in my private parts and i started to bleed again.  Is it permissable for me to keep fast or do i have to wait ten days from the start of my period.  Please let me know as soon as possible.  Jazakallah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYou do not have to wait for 10 days. The bleeding after the operation is due to the wound of the operation. It is not haidh.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
