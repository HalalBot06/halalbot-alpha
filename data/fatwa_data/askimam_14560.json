  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nthanks for your reply of question 1863 but i need some more explaination. You said that \"The issue of working in a bank is different from the issue of receivingsalary from the bank\". 1) How is it different? if working in bank is not acording to Shari'ah, What about the salary that person receives? Is that halal? 2) My father earned all money from bank, Is it Halal now (you said yes, can you please explain that how is it halal if wokring in an instituation which is based on INTEREST (sood)? 3) He is currently receiving 9000 Rs. as pension per month, is it halla too? 4) If all thi is hallal then please explain that what if i start a job in a bank. thanks for previous answer and waiting for answer of this question Regards\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe issue of working in a conventional bank must be viewed from two angles; a) Interest, b) Assisting in sin.\n\nA conventional bank operates on interest and other un-Islamic transactions. To work in such a department of the bank that actively promotes the un-Islamic transactions will be assisting in sin which is prohibited in the Qur’aan (Maaidah 5).\n\nHowever, if one has wrongfully worked for a bank and already rendered his service, the employer is bound to pay him for his services. It is a different issue that the person should not work there as that is assisting in sin. The employment itself and rendering services is a legitimate contract in the Shari’ah and the employee must be paid. Yes, the income will be contaminated (Karaahat) as the employment consisted of assisting in a wrongful act. In brief, the issue must be viewed from the initial and inception and also upon completion. A person should not work at a conventional bank as that will be assisting in sin. But if the person worked, he will be remunerated as that is a legitimate contract in Shari’ah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
