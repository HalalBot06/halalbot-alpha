  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualikum Mufti Saheb, I come from Indian background and the tradition there is not to cut nails/hair on Tuesdays and Sat? Is this tradition based on any Islamic priniciple ? Also, is there any \"correct\" way of cutting the nails ?? (Starting from the fore-finger etc.) May Allah bless you and raise your level in this world and the Akhirah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe have not come across any Shar'ee reference prohibiting the trimming of\nnails on Tuesdays and Saturdays.\n\nIt has been mentioned that Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to pair\nhis nails on a Thursday, but no sequence has been mentioned. However, many\npious people recommend that one should commence with the index finger of the\nright hand moving towards the small finger, thereafter the small finger of\nthe left hand leading towards the thumb and finishing with the thumb of the\nright hand. The toe nails, from the small toe of the right leg and complete\nwith the small toe of the left leg.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
