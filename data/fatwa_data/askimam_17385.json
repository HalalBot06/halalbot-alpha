  "question": "Is the droppings of Sheep impure?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nslmz Is the feaces of a sheep paak if its on the clothing or body?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe dung of sheep is impure according to all Hanafī Imāms. However, there is a difference of opinion among them as to whether it qualifies as Najāsah Ghalīdhah or Najāsah Khafīfah. According to Imām Abū Hanīfah رحمه الله  , it is considered as Najāsah Ghalīdhah and according to Imām Abū Yūsuf and Imām Muhammad  رحمهما الله, it is considered as Najāsah Khafīfah. The difference between the two views is that if it were considered as Ghalīdhah, then if it soils a person’s body or clothes, the amount of approximately 4 grams of such impurity would be overlooked.\n\nAny amount of such impurity greater than this will render the Salah invalid. In contrast, if it is considered as Khafīfah, then ¼ of the soiled area (e.g. sleeve etc) will be overlooked and Salah will only be invalid of the impurity exceeds ¼ of that area. In our era and circumstances, it is more prudent and cautious for the layman to follow the opinion of Imām Abū Hanīfah رحمه الله.  However, if a person is a farmer etc. or a person constantly working with sheep, where it becomes exceedingly difficult to abstain from the dung, then there will be some leeway for him to practice upon the view of Imam Abū Yūsuf and Imam Muhammad رحمهما الله . However, such a person should first consult with a learned Alim before practicing on this view.\n\n \n\n( أما الأوراث ) جميع روث هو رجيع ذي الحافر ( ؛والأخثاء ) جمع خثي وهو رجيع نوع البقر والفيل ( فكلها نجس نجاسة غليظة عند أبي حنيفة رحمه الله ) وعندهما نجاسة الأرواث والأخثاء سوى خثي الفيل خفيفة (كبيري ص 148, سهيل آكيديمي) \n\n \n\nIt should be noted that if the piece of dung is dry and merely touches a person cloth or body without leaving any traces of its impurity on the cloth or body, it will not be necessary to wash the cloth or body.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nMl.
