  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan you please tell me the hadith which states the reward of applying a sunnut of rasulluah(S.A.W) E.G SITTING ON tHE FLOOR.E.T.C\n\naLSO IF YOU ARE DOING Qasar of fajar how would you perform it\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] states, ‘He who holds firmly onto my Sunnah when my Ummah is in corruption and ruin, will acquire the reward of one hundred martyrs.’ Sitting on the floor to partake of meals is Sunnah as established in numerous Ahaadith. The love that we claim to cherish for Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] should steer us to adopt every possible Sunnah irrespective of the category of the Sunnah.\n\n2. There is no Qasr Salaat of Fajr since the Fardh is two Rakaats only. Yes, whilst traveling, you should perform the Sunnah two Rakaat of Fajr as they are the most emphasized of all the Sunnah Salaats.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
