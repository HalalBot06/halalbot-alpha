  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn one of your fatwahs you mentioned that all Prophets (SAW) are alive in their graves. Could you please explain in what ways they are alive? ZazakAllah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe bodies of the Prophets are preserved and remain intact in the grave. This is mentioned by Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] himself and is authentically proven. The Prophets are also alive in their graves.\n\nWe do not know the reality and exact nature of the life of the Prophets [alayhis salaam] in their graves. However, it is mentioned in the Hadith that when a person comes to visit Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and greets Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], he (Rasulullah) hears the greeting and also replies to the greeting. When a person sends greetings to Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] from far, the angels carry that salaams and convey it to Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam].\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
