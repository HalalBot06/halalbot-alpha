  "question": "The 10 fasts that we keep in the month of Zul- Hijjah.......",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThe 10 fasts that we keep in the month of Zul- Hijjah, can the intention be made for our missed fasts during Ramadhan also?If so, will we still be rewarded for the fasts and our fasts be made up? or one can't make a 'double' intention? i know the term ' double' is  not the correct word to use but i was just trying to make it it as clear as i could. Also, can one make dua that they will keep a fast if Allah fulfils' that person's prayer?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIt is Fardh for one to keep the missed fasts of Ramadhaan. The specific intention of the Fardh Qadha fast must be made. A dual intention of Nafl fast with the Qadha Fardh fast is incorrect.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
