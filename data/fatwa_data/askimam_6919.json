  "question": "While performing witr salat, I read a specific surah in the first and second rakah. Does the salaat have to be repeated? Can the same surah be recited in different rakah for any salaat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI realised the mistake after I had made takbir for dua-e-qunoot. Sajda Sahw was performed thereafter, as the mistake was realised. Does the salaat have to be repeated? Can the same surah be recited in different rakah for any salaat? Is this permitted?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is undesirable to repeat a Surah in another Rakaat. However, that does not necessitate Sajdah-e-Sahw.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
