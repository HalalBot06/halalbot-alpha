  "question": "Is it gheebat if I discuss the short comings of a muslim with a brother in order to correct him",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAlong with fellow muslim brothers we visit some muslims and tell them to come to the mosque. I told one of my brothers that i know a muslim who consumes alchol during ramadan. But suddenly the thought of gibat came to my mind and I didnt go on to tell his name. The other brothers suggested that we should go and meet him next week and invite him towards Islam. But I'm really worried now on two things. 1. If next week I go with my fellow muslim brothers then they all would probably realise that it is this perosn who I was talking about. What should I do. I was wondering if it would be ok for me to go alone and invite that brother to Islam so that his identity is hidden. 2.Is speaking of the shortsomings of a brother gibat(speaking without the intention of defaming him)?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Gheebah to mention the faults of a Muslim brother. If it is mentioned to a person who has authority over him, in order to stop him from this then it would be okay, however in your case it would not be right to mention his faults to the other brothers.(Shaami Vol. 6 Pg. 729 - Darul Fikr)\n\nThe correct manner would be for you to tell them that we should visit a certain brother and call him to the Masjid, salah and deen.\n\nThe solution to your current problem would be to go on your own or even better would be to go with another brother who was not there when you mentioned that he drinks in Ramadaan.\n\nIn the future instead of discussing specific faults of any brothers, you should simply say that it would be appropriate for us to visit so and so.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
