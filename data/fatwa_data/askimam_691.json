  "question": "What is our reason/purpose in this duniyah. Other then to follow Allah (SWT) and Islam.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI've been told the only reason this duniyah was created, was for the coming of Prophet Mohammed (Pbuh, peace be upon him).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala says in the Noble Qur'aan, 'And I have not created Jinn and mankind but that they worship me'.\n\nThe verse clearly states our purpose of being in this world. It is also stated in one Hadith-e-Qudsi, Allah Ta'ala says, 'Oh Muhammad, had it not been because of you, I would not have created the skies (world).' This Hadith indicates the honour and esteemed position of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) in the sight of Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
