  "question": "More recently I am finding it hard to concentrate in my Salaat. My mind seems to be wandering around thinking of all kinds of things, like my job, house, upcoming Islamic events, war, you name it....",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI try to think that this is my last Salaat, and the other prescriptions to force myself back, but am finding it quite hard. Very very occasionally some nude scenes come in front of me, and like I said it?s very occasional. Please help me understand, how I can force myself to concentrate. By the way, I pray AlhamduLillah 5 times a day, and offer my Fajr and Isha? daily at the Masjid. Not sure what kind of phase I am passing thru?.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDo not be concerned about these visions. These are the tricks of Shaytaan\ntrying to distract you.\n\nThe solution is to ignore these visions and concentrate on the Salaat.\nPonder over the words of Salaat, the postures of Salaat (are they correct),\nand the fact that you are communicating with Allah Ta'ala. If you pay\nattention to these visions, you will be diverting your attention away from\nAllah Ta'ala. This is exactly what Shaytaan wants from you. Do not succumb\nto the wish of the Shaytaan.\n\nContinue making Du'aa to Allah Ta'ala to grant you strength to overcome\nthese trials, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
