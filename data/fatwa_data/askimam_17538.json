  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI accept your ruling regarding Oasis and Futurerowth {trading in shares being impermissibille}. I have profits from the mentioned shares since I invested when there was no ruling regarding impermissablity. Can I use the profit to pay the vat on a vehicle I am purchasing.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nThe gain from the investments of Oasis and Futuregrowth is not regarded as profit but interest. It is therefore not permissible to use these interest funds to pay for VAT on any item.\n\nAnd Allah knows best \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
