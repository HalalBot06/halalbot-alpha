  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalamualaikum i wana know can a boy and a girl kiss eachother on the lips and if they love eachother and can a wife and husband do sex whenever they want and can a husband and wife see eachother nude\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible to kiss any girl with whom marriage is permissible. You may not touch nor see such a girl.\n\nA husband and wife may satisfy the desire with each other in lawful ways as often as they desire. One may see his wife nude, however, it is against modesty to do so as shamelessness creeps into one?s life.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
