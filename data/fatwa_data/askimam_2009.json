  "question": "I have been Muslim for about a year and I want to know how do i study to become a Imam or how does one become a Imam",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo become an Imaam or Moulana, generally, one studies at a Darul Uloom\n(institute of higher Islamic learning). The course is generally 6 or 7\nyears. Such institutes have been established in the US, Canada, England,\nSouth Africa, etc.\n\nSince you have been a Muslim for only one year, we assume that you will have\nto begin at an elementary level, which will require more time. Inform us of\nwhich part of the world you would be interested in studying at, so that we\nmay advise you further.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
