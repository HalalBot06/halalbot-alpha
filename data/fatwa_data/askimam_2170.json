In his absence, I experience the following difficulties due to not being able to drive: i) Lift for my children going and returning to school, ii) Going to the Doctor, iii) Purchasing basic necessities. In view of the abovementioned and other similar difficulties, is it permissible for me to drive?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, a female should stay within the confines of her home.
