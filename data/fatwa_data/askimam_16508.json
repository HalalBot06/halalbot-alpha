  "question": "How can you marry a person you dont know anything about?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nmy question is, suppose you getting married to someone you dont know, is it allowed in islam to meet the boy and talk things over. And what does islam say about engagement?\n\nAnd could you just confirm that is plukking ur eyebrows haram.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1. In principal it is permissible for the boy to look at the girl before marriage. However any other involvement between them; for example, speaking etc. is not permissible. Should they require additional information about each other.  As an alternative a female representative sholud act between them.\n\n(Aap Ke Masail, Vol.5.  Pg.34. Maktaba Bayanat)\n\n2. In islam nikaah is a simple issue. There is no need for engagements etc. as it involves many evils. Therefore it is not permissible.\n\n \n\n3.  It is not permissible to pluck ones eyebrows.\n\nNabi Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Salam is reported to have said; The curse of Allah Ta’ala is upon the woman who plucks (the hair of her face and eyebrows).\n\n(Bukhari, Vol.2. Pg.878. Qadimi Ktub Khana)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Safraz Mohammed,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
