  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know if it is permissable to allow my non muslim sister to eat on my dishes when she visits my home.  I am a convert she is sikh. I would also like to know if there are any other restrictions regarding keeping relations with non muslim family members.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAccording to Shariah, there are no restrictions upon you to have any relation with your non Muslim sister with the exception that you abstain from Haraam (prohibited), for example alcohol, swine etc.\n\nTherefore, your sister may eat at your home without any restriction. However, you should use the opportunity to present Islam to her in a good way. Try to convince her to accept Islam with your Ikhlaaq (character). If you become a means of her accepting Islam all her rewards will also be credited to you.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
