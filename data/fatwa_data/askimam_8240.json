  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a student in North America.This semester I ran out of money and couldnt pay for my fees. Now the university is charging me interest. 1. Is it allowed for me to continue studying and pay the fees later with interest(I follow the Hanafi Madhab)? My parents are willing to pay but they might have difficulty in paying the full amount and they might get burdened too. 2. Is it allowd for me to work and earn some money and keep it in an interest account so that I can pay my fees from that money. Is this allowed? 3. Also if its time for salat e.g Isha and I go to Musalla in our university and no one is there. I start my salat and some brothers, they join me later, should I read Surah Fatiha and another surah loudly. 4. Also is it Sunnah to put your hands on thighs when going in Sajdah and when standing up.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The payment of interest is also Haraam. What you may do is approach the university and request them to inflate the actual fee and allow you to pay it off as a long term loan. In this way, you will be protecting yourself from interest.\n\n2. No, it is prohibited to open an interest-bearing account for this purpose.\n\n3. When others join you in Salaat, the Faatiha and Surah should be recited aloud.\n\n4. Yes, it is Sunnah to do so.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
