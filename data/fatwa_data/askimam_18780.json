  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPart 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7tOle_BHXQ\nPart 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DJ9MU0xLho&feature=related\n\nCan you please see the and listen the above two links of video. In which some Maulana Ishaq From Pakistan talked about Sahaba Karam (R.A) with so much disrespect. Please guide us about him as so many simple Muslims are infected by his own view.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nAfter listening to his various lectures, we have come to a conclusion that Molana Ishāq from Pakistan is very valiant in his remarks against the SAHĀBA KIRĀM R.A and other fiqhi related questions. We advice Muslims to abstain from him and from his innovative ideologies which are contrary to  Ulama’e Haq.\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\nMl.
