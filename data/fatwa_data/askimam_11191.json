  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf I am kissing or hugging to my wife and there is some liquid comes out from my or her private parts then is it nullifies the wudoo or it nullifies the ghusal also? If I am and my wife touches each others private parts and slightly rubbing it but not a complete musterbation of it, so if in this condition some liquid comes out of anyone's private parts then what it nuliifies, wodoo aur ghusal? Thanks\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are three types of unusual (Ghayr Mu?taad) liquid that comes out from the private parts:\n\n1. Mazi ? liquid that comes out gradually upon erection and foreplay. The liquid is impure and nullifies the Wudhu. Ghusl is not necessary.\n\n2. Mani ? sperms which comes out with force. Sperms are impure and Ghusl becomes compulsory.\n\n3. Wadi ? liquid which comes out sometimes after urine.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
