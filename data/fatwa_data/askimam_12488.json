  "question": "If a child is born with some type of disorder - is it a punishment (for parents wrong doing) or a test from ALLAH ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for writing to the institute.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala is the designer and fashioner of all His creation. We human beings have no say in how each child will look like, what physical qualities it will have nor what mental capacities it will come with. None of us know how long its lifespan will be nor how the child will live in this world. %0D%0A%0D%0AWe are clearly told that Allah Ta'ala grants us children as a gift, more as a loan. Ultimately, all of us have to return to Him. We are also told that we will be tested by Allah Ta'ala through our wealth and our children.%0D%0A%0D%0ANo child is a punishment to its parents. This was a belief which existed in the days of ignorance prior to the advent of Islam. Although this is a child of its parents, it is firstly the creation of Allah Ta'ala. This creation has been placed in the care of two people by Allah Ta'ala. Parents who have children with mental or physical disabilities are doubly blessed. For every minute that they sacrifice their time, energy, sleep and comfort, they are earning unknown rewards and gifts from Allah Ta'ala. The full value of these gifts are not really known to us mankind here on earth. Another virtue is that when the parents deal with this child with kindness, love, acceptance, their own characters are strengthened and they earn the pleasure of Allah Ta'ala. Insha'allah, all the gates of Jannah will be thrown open to them in the aakhirah and Allah Ta'ala will invite them to enter Jannah through whichever gate they wish.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A1SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
