  "question": "With the current economic situation, if one is constantly worried about losing their job, does this indicate lack of Faith in Allah s.w.t., or is it just human nature? How should one react?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThis concern is human nature. Anxiety is no indication of lack of faith.\n\nEven the Ambiyaa went through periods of natural fear and anxiety. Your\nfaith should be in the fact that Allah provides through various means - one\nof them being employment. Use the means available but have true conviction\nand trust in Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nÂ \n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
