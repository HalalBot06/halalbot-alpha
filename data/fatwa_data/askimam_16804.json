  "question": "Using someones as reference",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\na person completes his education & gets into practical life, if he wants to join a private company, then there are very few chances to get job without involving some body reference.\n\nCan he use this type of reference or not ?\nwhich type of reference he can use?\nKindly explain in detail from Islamic point of view.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is permissible to use somebody's reference which is true. Therefore, it will not be permissible for someone to inform the company of such qualifications which the potential employee does not possess. This is considered as kidhb (lies) and makr (deception); both of which are prohibited in Shariah. \n\n فتاوي محمودية 18/ 477 (جامعة فاروقية)\nاحسن الفتاوي  8/  198 (سعيد)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
