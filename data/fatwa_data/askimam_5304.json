  "question": "PLease explain the meaning of Hadith ... fast 10 muharram ashura",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nNarrated Ibn 'Umar: The Prophet observed the fast on the 10th of Muharram ('Ashura), and ordered (Muslims) to fast on that day, but when the fasting of the month of Ramadan was prescribed, the fasting of the 'Ashura' was abandoned. 'Abdullah did not use to fast on that day unless it coincided with his routine fasting by chance. Does this mean that we cant keep fast on the 10th.If we do than we have to keep fast for one more day either 11th or 9th.And if we dont keep fast on the 9th or 11th with 10th are we commiting a sin .So it this Hadith correct? Jazakalah khairan.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe actual meaning of this Hadith is that before the fast of Ramadhaan, the%0D%0Afast of the 10th of Muharram was compulsory on the Muslims. However, after%0D%0Athe obligation of the fast of Ramadhaan, the compulsion of the fast of%0D%0AMuharram was obliterated, though it remained a stressed Mustahabb%0D%0A(preferred) fast.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf one does not fast on Aashura, he will not be sinful. And alternatively,%0D%0Aif he chooses to observe the fast, he will be greatly rewarded. Bearing in%0D%0Amind that to fast on the 10th only is improper%2FMakrooh because of the%0D%0Aresemblance with the Jews in this act. As we know, the Jews also observe the%0D%0Afast (10th only).%0D%0A%0D%0AImam Ahmad narrates on the authority of Sayyiduna Abdullah ibn Abbaas%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhu) that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) mentioned,%0D%0A'Fast on Aashura, but oppose the Jews in it. Hence, fast either a day before%0D%0Ait or after it.' Hence, fast either a day before it or after it. And in%0D%0Aanother narration, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to%0D%0Ahave said, 'If I live till the next year, I will definitely fast on the 9th%0D%0Aas well.' He had mentioned this after learning that the Jews also used to on%0D%0AAashura (the tenth only)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
