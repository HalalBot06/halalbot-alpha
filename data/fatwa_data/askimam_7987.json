  "question": "In many of your answers you've mentioned that wife's milk is not allowed for the husband to drink, could you please give some proof from the Qur'an or hadith.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI've read a fatwa of Shaikh M.Al-Qaradawi that it is not prohibited for the husband to drink his wife's milk. Jazak Allah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFirstly, we need to realize that not every single aspect of Deen is proven directly from the Qur?aan and Hadith. Many aspects of Deen are proven through principles that are deduced from the Qur?aan and Hadith.\n\nBased on the above, the Fuqahaa have ruled that it is Haraam for a man to drink the milk of his wife. However, one is allowed to fondle and touch the breasts of his wife if there is no fear of milk entering his mouth. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyah; Ahsanul Fataawa)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
