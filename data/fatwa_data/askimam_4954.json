  "question": "When the mind wanders during Salaat, does this indicate lack or weakness of Imaan? How can it be locked down?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDoes the reward for the Salaat diminish due to this? How about when praying in Jamaat? Also, how is the reward for praying in Jamaat awarded? Does this depend at all on how devoted the congregation is?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWandering of the mind is of two types, a) volitional (within one's control),%0D%0Aand b) involitional (stray thoughts)%0D%0A%0D%0Aa) Volitional, i.e. within one's control. One should not deliberately cause%0D%0Athe mind to stray. Do not intentionally drift from one thought to another.%0D%0Ab) Involitional, i.e. stray thoughts. These are thoughts that enter the mind%0D%0Awith no apparent cause, or no previous thought leading to this thought.%0D%0AThese stray thoughts are not harmful, and do not cause the reward of Salaat%0D%0Ato diminish. However, the moment one realizes the mind has drifted by these%0D%0Astray thoughts, then immediately bring it back to the Salaat. As long as you%0D%0Aadopt this remedy, then there is nothing to be worried or perturbed about.%0D%0AEach person is rewarded according to his personal devotion to Salaat.%0D%0AHowever, the company of pious people in the Jamaat influences one devotion%0D%0Aand renders it easier to concentrate.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Imraan Vawda%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Muhammad Kadwa"
