  "answer": "QUESTION\ni want to know what does dreaming about white eggs means? i asked u before and you told me it has a positive sign, but what does it mean? Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah Ta’ala has created man and also created things on earth that contribute to the extra comfort and well-being of man during his temporary stay on earth. One is the comfort of the physical body and the other is the comfort of the spiritual soul. Allah Taa’la has arranged for the comfort of both these on the earth. For the physical body, Allah Taa’la has created the sun, moon, air, trees, cars, aeroplanes, etc. and for the spiritual body Allah Taa’la sent His messengers to guide humanity to eternal success and happiness. To every nation Allah deputed a Nabi to give glad tidings to those who obeyed Allah and warn those who rebelled against the Laws of Allah until the chain of Prophet hood terminated with the arrival of our august master and leader, Sayyidina Muhammed (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam). Abu Hurairah [radhiallaahu anhu] reports that Rasulullah ((Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said \"None of the portions of Prophet hood is left except glad tidings. The Sahaabah enquired, what is glad tidings? Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) replied good dreams. (Bukhari) Allaamah Suyooti (Rahmatullahi Alayhi) states that the meaning of the Hadith is that after the demise of Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) there will be no Wahy through which people will be guided except that Allah will show someone a dream through which people may guided in the future. (Mirqaat vol.8 Pg. 375 Tijaariyya).\n\nAlthough prophethood has ended, a portion of prophethood in the form of true and pious dreams remain. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘No portion of prophethood remains but glad tidings.’ The common point between prophethood and true dreams is information from the unseen. Wahy and revelation is information from Allah. Similarly is the condition with true and pious dreams.\n\nSahabah (Radiallahu Anhum) mention that it was the noble habit of Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) that when he used to complete the Fajr Salaah he used to enquire if any one had seen a dream. If any Sahabi seen a dream he would narrate it to Rasulullah, and Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) would interpret the dream. It was also the practice of Nabi (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) to narrate his dream.\n\nThere are three types of dreams\n\nA) The dream of the Prophets\n\nB) Good dreams\n\nC) Bad dreams\n\nThe dreams of Ambiyya are a type of Wahy (revelation) and are always true. Allah mentions the dream of Ebrahim (Alayhis Salaam) in the Quraan.\n\nGood dreams of a Mu’min are a blessing from Allah. In one Hadith Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said a good dream is one portion of the forty-six portions of Nubuwat. (Mishkaat vol.8 Pg. 376 with Mirqaat). Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) practically demonstrated to us the way to lead our lives to the minutestest detail. Nabi (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) shown us the complete Deen including the different aspects of dreams.\n\nBad dreams are from Shaytaan. Rasulullah ((Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said if any one of you experience a bad dream, he/she should seek protection in Allah from Shaytaan.\n\nHowever, it is important to understand that dreams should not become the focus of our attention. Many a times dreams are an exposition of ones thoughts. The example of dreams is like a person travelling. While travelling the traveller sees different sceneries and passes on. He does not make the scenery his ultimate goal and objective and stops his travel. He continues his journey.\n\nInterpretation of dreams is a delicate science. No ordinary person may interpret dreams. The information and condition of the person who sees the dream and the time when he sees the dream etc. is important for the interpreter to know. Ibne Sireen (Rahmatullahi Alayhi) a famous interpreter of dreams states that a person should only request an interpretation from a person who is qualified to interpret dreams. A person who has the following qualifications qualify to interpret dreams\n\nA) He must have adequate knowledge of the Tafseer of the Quraan.\n\nB) He must be a Haafiz of the Ahadith of Rasulullah ((Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nC) He must be well versed in the Arabic language.\n\nD) He must be familiar with the roots of words so that he knows where they are derived from.\n\nE) He must be familiar with the nature and status of people.\n\nF) He must be familiar with the basic principles of interpretation.\n\nG) He must possess a pure and clean soul.\n\nH) He must be a man with sound morality.\n\nI) He must be honest in speech and conduct.\n\nThe interpretation below is not an exact interpretation of your dream. It is merely an indication of the possible interpretations based on experiences and information.\n\nGenerally, eggs represent women or it is a sign of prosperity.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
