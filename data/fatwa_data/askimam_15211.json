  "question": "She faces criticism for wearing Hijab and Jilbaab in a gathering",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIn an event where a woman has to attend marriage functions of a very close relative where men and women would be together without any segregation, there would be dances performed by young guys and girls, there would be songs, music, and even a dance floor for all the guests to dance with the bride and groom, WHAT IS THE BEST LEVEL OF HIJAB/PURDAH for that woman in such a situation? Would it be sufficient for the woman to just cover her head with a scarf but wear fancy, bright and attractive wedding outfits with light make-up?( even though she wants to wear a jilbab and hijab BUT because she belongs to a very liberal family where the correct followers of deen are almost none she would have to face hardships and criticism for wearing a jilbab?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAt the outset it is important to know that we are slaves of Allah. He is our creator and we are obligated to Him at all times. We are bound to adhere to the commands of Allah in every aspect of our life. The quality of a slave is that he expresses submission and subjugation to the masters orders even though it may be against his wishes. Similarly we are slaves to Allah and obey Him even though it may be against our desires and honour.\n\nIt is not permissible to attend a mixed gathering where males and females sit together. Furthermore, you state that young boys and girls dance and sing at the occasion. This is another Haraam. Therefore, even if you cover yourself it will not be permissible to attend this function.\n\nHowever, since it is your close relative, you may seize the opportunity to make Dawah and rectify the customs of the family. You may request them to make separate arrangements and stop the dancing and music. If they agree then you have achieved your objective of Nahi anil Munkar (stopping people from sin). However, if they decline to change the set up, you must recuse yourself from attending. In doing so, surely you will meet opposition and criticism. You should remain firm and steadfast. This is the plot of Shaytaan which you must bear. The taste is bitter but the outcome is rich. You rather bear the comments of your family than the punishment of Allah. Console yourself with high and lofty stages that Allah will bless you with in the Hereafter for upholding His command. Remember to uphold one command of Allah is far better than the entire world and whatever it contains. Through your sacrifice an era will dawn in your family where the commands of Allah will be honoured and upheld and you will reap the rewards and benefits of that, Inshallah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
