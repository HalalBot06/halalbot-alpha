  "question": "How does one deal with non-Muslims when questioned on the age of Bibi Ayesha RadhiAllahu Anha at the time of her marriage to the Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPOLYGAMOUS LIFE OF RASULULLAH (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta%E3la has given certain priviledges only to Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam) which are mentioned in Chapter 33 vs 50-51. Among other%0D%0Apriviledges one was having more than four wives simultaneously. Allah Ta%E3la%0D%0Asays, 'Oh Nabi (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) we have made permissible for%0D%0Ayou your wives.' (Ahzaab 33-50). The polygamous marriages of Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) to more than four wives simultaneously should%0D%0Abe viewed as obeying the order of Allah Ta%E3la to do so. It was not merely a%0D%0Ameans of fulfilling his carnal desires as many people allege. The Arab%0D%0Aenvironment was infested with many evils among which was adultery and%0D%0Afornication. Despite living in such an environment, he never indulged in%0D%0Athis evil act. His modesty was so popular among his people that when the%0D%0AProphet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) claimed prophethood, his people made%0D%0Aevery effort to disgrace him by accusing him of being a poet, practising%0D%0Awitchcraft, of being insane, etc. However, nobody ever accused him of any%0D%0Aact of immodesty. The Prophet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) was very%0D%0Ahandsome and attractive. Many beautiful women from honourable families even%0D%0Aproposed marriage to Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) but he%0D%0Adeclined. Instead, when he was only 25 years of age he married a widow who%0D%0Ahad children from her previous marriage. Considering the fact that he was%0D%0Athe most handsome person that Allah Ta%E3la has created, many women desired%0D%0Ahim in marriage. Had he followed his desires, there was no obstacle for him%0D%0Ato do so. In his youth, he could have had many many beautiful women, but he%0D%0Amarried a widow 15 years his senior. He lived with her for 25 years and she%0D%0Abore all the children of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) except%0D%0Aone. When Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) was 50 years of age,%0D%0AHadhrat Khadija (Radhiallaahu %C1nha) passed away. Those 25 years of%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)'s marriage was a monogamous one.%0D%0AThe polygamous marriage was only after he attained the age of 50.%0D%0A%0D%0AAFTER 50 YEARS%0D%0AHe married Hadhrat Sawdah and %C1aisha (Radhiallaahu %C1nhuma). Sawda%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu %C1nha) lived with him immediately but %C1aisha (Radhiallaahu%0D%0A%C1nha) came to live with him in the year 2 AH. when he was approximately 54%0D%0Ayears of age.%0D%0A%0D%0A55 YEARS (3 AH.)%0D%0AHe married Hadhrath Hafsa (Radhiallaahu %C1nha). After a few months, he%0D%0Amarried Hadhrat Zaynab bin Khuzaymah (Radhiallaahu %C1nha) who lived with him%0D%0Afor only 3 or 18 months (as recorded in different narrations) before she%0D%0Apassed away.%0D%0A%0D%0A56 YEARS (4 AH.)%0D%0AHe married Umme Salma (Radhiallaahu %C1nha)%0D%0A%0D%0A57 YEARS (5 AH.)%0D%0AHe married Zaynab (Radhiallaahu %C1nha)%0D%0A%0D%0A58 YEARS (6 AH)%0D%0AHe married Hadhrat Juwayriyah (Radhiallaahu %C1nha)%0D%0A%0D%0A59 YEARS (7 AH.)%0D%0AFirst he married Umme Habibah then Safiyyah then Maymoonah (Radhiallaahu%0D%0A%C1nhunna) in one year.%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the above explanation, it is clear that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam)'s marriage was a monogamous one till he was 50 years. His%0D%0Apolygamous marriages, mostly to widows were after the age of 50 with the%0D%0Acommand of Allah Ta%E3la. Had Nabi (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) followed his%0D%0Acarnal desires, he would have married all virgins and changed them in short%0D%0Aperiods of time. Since the polygamous marriages of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam) was by the order of Allah, therefore, the wisdom of that%0D%0Aorder cannot be questioned nor comprehended. However, according to our%0D%0Alimited understanding, the wisdom underlying the polygamous marriages of%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) was:%0D%0A1. Since Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) came as a teacher to%0D%0Amankind, there are many avenues of a person's domestic life which had to be%0D%0Aconveyed to the Ummah. It was the many wives of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam) who had the knowledge of these aspects and fulfilled their%0D%0Aresponsibility by conveying the teachings of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam) to the Ummah. Consider the following:%0D%0A%C1aisha (Radhiallaahu %C1nha) alone narrated approximately 2210 Ahaadith with%0D%0Aregard to different laws, character, ettiquettes, etc. The narrations of%0D%0AHadhrat Umme Salma (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) totals up to 378. Hafiz ibn Qayyim%0D%0A(RA) mentions that if the Fataawa of Hadhrat Umme Salma (RA) had to be%0D%0Agathered which she gave after the demise of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam), then the need would arise to compile an entire book. The total%0D%0Astudents of %C1aisha (Radhiallaahu %C1nha) are approximately 200 and she taught%0D%0ADeeni knowledge for 48 years consecutively after the demise of Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam).%0D%0A2. The mission of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) was to convert%0D%0Apeople and propagate Islam. By marrying one woman, her entire tribe had%0D%0Aaccepted Islam. This was done by virtue of marrying that woman.%0D%0A3. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) had to transform the evils of%0D%0Athe society by practice. The people shunned marrying widows especially if%0D%0Athey already had children from their previous husbands. Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) married a widow and thereby changed the wrong%0D%0Aideology of the people. Likewise, he reformed the society that abused the%0D%0Aorphans by caring for the orphans of the women he married.%0D%0A%0D%0AThese are but just a few wisdoms of the polygamous marriages of Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
