  "question": "Was Usama Bin Ladin justified in destroying those buildings in New York?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nUsama Bin Ladin has recently come close to admitted he planned the destruction of those buildings in New York, on his last tape he sent to Al Jazeera TV. if Allah would have wanted those buildings destroyed, would he not have done it himself (as in earthquake, flood)? or would Allah have allowed the buildings built in the first place if he didn't want the people to have them? do you think Bin Ladin is \"hijacked Islam\" for his cause of killing people, as some say? Can you give reference from Qur'an and Hadith? May the goodness of Allah be with you.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe have no information regarding him admitting this deed. He did not admit\ndoing this nor is there conclusive proof showing he is guilty of this crime.\n\nIf Allah Ta'ala wishes to destroy someone or something, he employs various\nmethods or people to carry out the destruction. Sometimes, he employs\n'natural' forces and sometimes he uses other people to carry out this\ndestruction which is actually a form of His divine punishment.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
