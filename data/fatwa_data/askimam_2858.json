  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy father has been suffering from Black magic. He has been experiencing enormous physical pain for months now. Nothing seems to work. All aamils have been literally fake, cant find any decent aamils that deal with problems in islamic way. Most suggest rediculous things like slaughtering black goats and putting meat in the river. Months of sheer physical pain has taken toll on my father's health. He has set hours each day, when the Jins come and literally torture him. My mother reads Quran, but as soon as she stops, Jins start again. If she rreads Quran for 8 hours, the Jins start their torture after 8 hours, so it seems almost hopeless. My father is Unfortunate that he did not bother to learn Quran in his life, so he cant read himself, other than a few Sura . We have just about managed to teach him Ayat Ul Kursi. Please please help us on how to coounter thsi problem cos lot of things are going out of hand e.g father accusing innocent people of putting jins on him, not to mention his daily ailing health. It has cause dthe whole family a tremendous amount of grief, suffering. Please tell us what can be done to get ridd of this problem permanently, cos no aamils,or aything seems to work. i would not be asking for help if i was not desperate.
