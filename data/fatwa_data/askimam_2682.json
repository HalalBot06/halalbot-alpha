  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have dreamed a sort of same kind of dream two or three times. In it fellow muslims are praying but they are praying the wrong way. Each one making his own type of mistake. This was in a masjid. Each one was praying a different way. In one of the other dreams I am praying in congregation and the brothers are praying the wrong way and i copy them. What does this all mean? Why do I always see people praying the wrong way in my dreams? Also I would like to ask you about Lucid dreaming - It is when you realize you are dreaming while you ar e dreaming. This means you can do whatever you want since it is all your imagination and it feels very real. I was just wondering what islamic rules I have to follow. I am I still allowed to haraam things like fantisize about women when I dream? What about intercorse in the dream - it is sort of like mastubration since it leads to ejaculation since your brain thinks you are actually having intercorse. Sometimes when you aren't that \"lucid\" (meaning you are not so aware you are dreaming) you act on impulse and what comes to mind first is often women. Is this lucid dreaming alright? Do islamic rules still apply in it? I find I can subsitute lucid dreaming for TV since it comes in the entertainment category and I can skip tv watching and do work and multi task my sleeping to sleep and fun.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0A1. People performing Salaat in different direction is a reflection of the%0D%0Adisunity in the Ummah.%0D%0A2. There are three types of dreams, a) pious dreams, b) Evil (Shaytaani)%0D%0Adreams, c) Reflection of one's thoughts. When one sees an evil dream, upon%0D%0Arealising that, he%2Fshe should recite Laa hawla Walaa Quwwata Illaa billaahi%0D%0Aand change directions. It is not permissible to continuously fantasise over%0D%0Aevil things (masturbation, etc.) during semi-sleep. Furthermore, lucid%0D%0Adreaming is not the solution to TV. Entertainment and fun is permissible%0D%0Aonly within the parameters of Shari'ah. Masturbation, sex, fantasising over%0D%0Awomen are all strictly prohibited in Shari'ah. We advise you recite Surah%0D%0AMulk, beginning of Juz 29 of the noble Qur'aan, the last four Quls (last%0D%0Afour Surahs of the noble Qur'aan) commencing with Surah Kaafiroon before%0D%0Asleeping. Think and ponder about your shortcomings during the day and make%0D%0ATawbah before sleeping as one does not know whether his soul will be%0D%0Areleased from Allah to live another day. What if the soul is kept back to%0D%0Adie whilst having such bad and evil thoughts? Such a soul will be deprived%0D%0Aof the mercy of Allah Ta'ala. Before sleeping, ponder upon death and life%0D%0Aafter death. Insha Allah, Allah will bestow you with good and pious dreams,%0D%0Athe enjoyment of which is far exceeding than the restlessness 'enjoyment' of%0D%0Alucid dreams.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
