  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nImaam Muhammad (rah) has recorded a hadith about pointing the indexfinger in salah when reading the At Tahhiyaat in his Muwatta just before the chapter on Tashahhud, establishing this and thereafter mentions that we accept and follow this and this was also the opinion of Imaam Abu Hanifah (rah).\n\nCan you please reproduce that hadeeth and its comment made by Imaam Muhammad?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMaalik has informed that Muslim ibn Abi Maryam informed from Ali ibn Abdur Rahmaan al-Muawiy that he said, ‘Abdullah ibn Umar [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] saw me whilst I was playing with pebbles in Salaat. When I turned (after completing my Salaat), he prevented me saying ‘do as Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] did.’ I asked, ‘what was Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] ‘s practice?’ he said, ‘When Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] sat in Salaat, he placed his right hand on his right thigh and he clasped all his fingers and pointed with the finger next to the thumb, i.e. index finger and he placed his left hand on his left thigh.\n\nImaam Muhammad [ra] said, ‘We adopt the practice of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and this is the view of Imaam Abu Hanifa [ra]’\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
