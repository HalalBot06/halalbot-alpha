  "question": "Bringing infants to the Masjid and let them play or let them sit in front of them while praying.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Mufti sahib, What is the ruling of bringing the minor kids to the masjid playing walking in front of musalleens and making noise disturbing almost all the musalleens. Musalleens are loosing concentration during salaat. Please quote any hadith in this regard so that I can post in the Masjid. Thanks.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nChildren in the Musjid%0D%0A%0D%0AChildren who do not know ettiquettes of the Masjid and have no knowledge of%0D%0Aritual cleanliness should NOT be allowed to come to the Masjid. Similarly,%0D%0Achildren who know ritual cleanliness and also know the sanctity and%0D%0Areverence of the Masjid are permitted to come to the Masjid.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'When the child is%0D%0Aseven years old, order him to say prayers and when he is ten years old,%0D%0ACHASTISE HIM TO DO SO.' (Mishkaat). It does not mean that when the child is%0D%0Aseven years old, he can pay due respect to the Masjid. The instruction and%0D%0Atraining for prayer can also be given at home. When a child has attained%0D%0Aseven years of age and he can show respect to the Masjid and understand%0D%0Aritual cleanliness, he is permitted to come to the Masjid. There is no%0D%0Aprohibition for such a child.%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Keep your insane people and%0D%0Ayour children away from the Masjid' (Ibn Maajah). This prohibition is%0D%0Agenerally flouted nowadays where little children create disturbance in the%0D%0Amasjid. Often it has been experienced that little children by their crying%0D%0Adistract the father and other Musallees as well. The prohibition is based on%0D%0Athe sanctity, reverence and cleanliness of the masjid. It is also improper%0D%0Ato bring little children into the Saffs (rows) of adults.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
