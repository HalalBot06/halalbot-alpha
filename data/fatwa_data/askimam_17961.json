  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalam-o-alekum\n\nI wanted to ask that one of my friends have commited Zana before marriage but she has married with the same person with whom she had committed this sin.\n\nShe was not muslim before marriage and when committed Zana but after marriage she accepted Islam. Now will she be punished at the day of judgement?\n\nOr what alternative can she do for getting forgiveness from Allah?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nAs a basic rule, once a person accepts Islam, all that persons sins are forgiven. Rasulullah said:\n\nأن الإسلام يهدم ما كان قبله\n\n \n\n“Indeed Islam destroys whatever occurred before. (Of sin)” (Muslim)\n\n \n\nIn the light of the above mentioned Hadith, she will not be punished on the Day of Judgement.\n\n \n\nIf the person she committed Zina with was a non Muslim, then her marriage to him has not taken place; as it is prohibited for a Muslim female to marry a non Muslim male.\n\nOn the other hand, if the person was a Muslim, then he will have to make sincere Taubah (repentence) to Allah for the major sin he has committed. However, he should not lose hope as Almighty Allah is most Merciful. Allah states in the Holy Quran:\n\n                       \n\n                   لَا تَقْنَطُوا مِنْ رَحْمَةِ اللَّهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ جَمِيعًا إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ\n\n \n\n“Do not despair in the mercy of Allah, Indeed Allah forgives all sins. Verily He is the most Forgiving most Merciful.” (Surah Zumar)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
