  "question": "blood came out while making wudhu, i just continued. is my wudhu correct?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDuring wuhdu prior to Fajr salat when I was about to wash my feet, one foot hit a corner near the basin and blood started to come out. I washed that part until blood was stopped flowing. I washed both feet and completed wudhu and immediately prayed Fajr because only 10 minutes were remaining in Sunrise.\n\nMy question is, since I did not do the whole wudhu again and just completed the wudhu after some blood came out, was my wudhu correct or not? The blood was not a lot though. Should I repeat that salah?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe limbs that were washed before the bleeding became invalid upon the bleeding. The entire Wudhu had to be repeated. The Salaat is invalid and you will have to repeat the Fajr Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
