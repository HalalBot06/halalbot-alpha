  "question": "My mother was christian and then converted to islam to marry my father.She later started going back to church.Is she a murtad?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy mother says that she converted just to please everybody and never believedin Islam.She was 18 when this happened . As know i want to get married but the boy's father (who i want to marry)says that I am gharaam for him because i am not cutting ties with my mother?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In principle, if a person accepts Islam and thereafter reneges from Islam, the person comes out from the fold of Islam. If the person was married, the marriage becomes invalid.\n\n2. According to the Shari?ah, as a daughter you should not severe ties with your mother. You should serve her to the best of your ability. Use your relationship with her to bring her back to Islam. The assertion that you are Haraam, upon the boy you wish to marry due to you not severing ties with your mother is incorrect.\n\nAnd Allah Ta?ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
