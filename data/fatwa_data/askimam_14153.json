  "question": "\"Being unpateint is a sign of fail in the test and vice versa.\"",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI once once asked someone a question and he gave me a reply of which 2 points from the reply is copied and pasted below: \n\n1. \"Allah Ta'ala trains and tests his beloved servants in many ways through different tests. If they were pateint they succeed and if not then Allah still many times forgives them and sometimes gets angry on them.\"\n\nCan you tell me what the impatient can expect when Allah gets angry with him?\n\n\n2. \"Being unpateint is a sign of fail in the test and vice versa.\"\n\nSuppose the person passes his test because of patience, then what does he get compared to that person who was impatient on his test? As far as I know, the patient gets rewards and the impatient dosen't get the same rewards. Are there any other differences?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1) Allah’s anger will expose itself in different ways and times. Allah in His infinite wisdom may express His anger in different ways to different individuals. We do not understand and know how Allah will express His anger. That is in Allah’s infinite knowledge and wisdom.\n\n2) The difference is of reward and punishment.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
