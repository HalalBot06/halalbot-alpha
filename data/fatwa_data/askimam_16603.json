  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease give me an authentic hadith on where should we keep our hand when we offered Salah. Why other maslak like according to Imaam malik says keep your hands on chest also give reference.\n\nIs ok suppose someone start Raffiya-ul-dayan but he never offered in his past life. and sometimes he does some time not. He says Rasulallah s.a.w. did both, so i do.\n\nPlease give refereces of Hidith on both cases and I will followed Sahi Hadith because I am so confused.\n\nJazakallah. \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAt the outset, it is important to understand that there are four Imams of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence). They are namely Imam Abu Hanifa, Imam Malik, Imam Shafi’ee and Imam Ahmad Bin Hambal (Rahimahumullah).\n\nIn our religious related issues such as Fiqh we are required to follow there rulings, for they had understood the Quran and Ahadith in the most perfect manner.\n\nWe are responsible to follow only one of these four Imams in our Islamic rulings. Hence, if a person has made a decision to follow one of the above mentioned Imams, then in all his Islamic rulings he should that particular Imam; for example, if a person has decided to follow Imam Abu Hanifa in his Islamic rulings then he should adhere strictly to all the rulings of Imam Abu Hanifa. It will not be permissible for him to also follow the rulings of Imam Malik. If a person follows more than one Imam for his Islamic rulings, then this will create confusion. Therefore, we advise that you to follow only one Imam to save yourself from confusion.\n\nWe are followers of Imaam Abu Hanifa and strictly adhere to his rulings. Hereunder are the rulings of Imam Abu Hanifa as per your query:\n\nIt is the ruling of Imaam Abu Hanifa that men should place their hands below their navels during salat and not on the chest.  \n\nWaail bin Hujar (radiyallaahu anhu) reports:\n\nرأيت النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وضع يمينه على شماله في الصلاة تحت السرة.\n\n“I saw Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) placing his right hand over his left           hand, below the navel during salat” (Ibn Abi Shayba, vol 1, pg 390)\n\n(The chain of narrators in the above hadith is authentic- Athaar Al-Sunan, pg 90, Imdadiyya)\n\nIt is also the ruling of Imam Abu Hanifa that Raf’ul Yadain (to raise the hands) is only allowed once in salat ie: at the beginning of salat. It will not be permissible to raise the hands more than once in salat.\n\nAlqamah (rahimahullah) reports:\n\nعن علقمة قال قال عبد الله بن مسعود ألا أصلى بكم صلاة رسول الله -صلى الله عليه وسلم- فصلى فلم يرفع يديه إلا فى أول مرة\n\n“Abdullah bin Mas’ood once asked them: Shall I perform for you the salat of Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)? So he performed the salat and lifted his hands only at the beginning of the salat” (Al-Tirmizhi, vol 1, pg 59, HM Sa’eed)\n\n(The above Hadith is authentic- Athaar Al-Sunan, pg 133, Imdadiyya)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
