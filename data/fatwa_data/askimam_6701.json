  "answer": "QUESTION\ni got married about 6 months back but i found that my husband has some very bad habits means lieing, cheating and fraud etc, if i try to make him understand he become mad and start abusing me, please tell something to read that it can change his these bad habits\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nReading Du'aas and Wazifas is not sufficient to change your husband's bad\nhabits.\n\nYou should observe why does he lie, cheat, etc. and plan carefully to change\nthat. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'There is no\nintelligence equivalent to planning.' You should plan your cause of action\nand work towards that diligently. If that is properly carried out, Insha\nAllah, it will be successful.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
