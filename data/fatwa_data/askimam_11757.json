  "question": "wearing rings made out of metals other than gold or silver.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIt is mentioned in Behisti Zewar that women are not allowed to wear rings made out of metals other than gold or silver. Assuming that I have not misread this masla, what is the daleel this masla is based on.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis is the opinion of the majority of Hanafi Jurists, even though their is\nsome difference of opinion in imitation rings.\n\nThis view is based on the ahadith mentioning that Nabi (sallalahu Alaihi\nWasallam) rebuked a person wearing a iron ring and said that he is wearing\nthe jewellery of the people of Jahannum. He threw away the ring and wore one\nof brass upon which Nabi (sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) said that the smell of\nidols is emanating from it (as idols were generally made of brass). He then\nasked Nabi (sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) what ring he should wear, so Nabi\n(sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) instructed him to wear one of silver, its weight\nbeing less than a mithqaal (4.85 grams).\n\nNarrated by Abu Dawud Vol.4 Pg.90, Tirmizi Vol.4 Pg.248, Ibn Hibbaan Vol.12\nPg.299, Nasai Vol.8 Pg.172)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
