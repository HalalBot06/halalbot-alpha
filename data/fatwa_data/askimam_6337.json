  "question": "Did Warqa Bin Noofal accepted Islam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe scholars have differed on the issue whether Waraqah accepted Islam or\nnot. (Asadul Ghaabah vol.5 pg.416)\n\nHowever, Hafiz ibn Hajar (RA) has chosen to reconcile between the 2\nconflicting views in his books, Fathul Baari (vol.1 pg.36) and al-Isaabah\n(vol.6 pg.476). He says that it is possible that Waraqah lived until the\nvery early stages of Islam. Besides Hafiz ibn Hajar (RA), scholars such as\nal-Baghawiy, ibn Qaanoi', al-Tabari and ibnus-Sakan were also of the view\nthat Waraqah was, in fact, a Sahaabi.
