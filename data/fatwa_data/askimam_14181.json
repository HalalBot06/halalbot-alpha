  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy mother had always told me that women are supposed to perform Wudu and be properly covered (i.e wear a hijaab) when reciting the Quran.  The other day I was told that women do not have to wear a hijaab while reciting the Quran. Can you please advise me which is correct? Can you also show me proof from a Hadith or the Quran?\n\nI would also like to know if a Muslim says Jazakallah to you, what is the response to it? What is its meaning in english?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The Qur’aan is the words of Allah Ta’ala. He has revealed the Qur’aan to guide us. We should show appreciation to Allah for that and respect the Qur’aan. This is one of the reasons that a person cannot touch the Qur’aan without Wudhu. If one wishes to touch the Qur’aan, he has to make Wudhu and prepare his state of mind and attain a level of spirituality before reciting the Qur’aan. It is only with such respect and dedication can one really benefit from the Qur’aan. The more respect one shows to the Qur’aan, the more he/she will benefit from the Qur’aan. The advice by your mother to wear Hijaab when reciting the Qur’aan is correct and according to the respect one should show to the Qur’aan.\n\n2. Jazaakallah is a du’aa which means ‘May Allah reward you.’ The response to that should be, ‘Aameen’.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
