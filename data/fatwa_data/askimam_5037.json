  "question": "Why are shia’a different?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAsalamu alakum. Why are they considered kafireen? They believe in Allah and his messenger ( p.b.u.h), they prey 5 times a day. How is it haram to merry one if they believe in Allah and his messenger (p.b.u.h)? from what I have been told, Allah loves those who love him and believe in the prophet?..shia?a love Allah and believe in the prophet. Their women wear hejab, they fast the holy month. I have talked to one and they say the only difference is they prey with their hands to the side and that they believe in safe Ali( what is that). Please help me understand why they are considered kafireen if they made shihaddah. Allah ma?ak\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nUNBRIDGEABLE DIVIDE\n———————————–\n\nThe protracted contrariety between Islam and Shi’ism is but a clear\nreflection of fundamental differences between the two. The only common\ndenominator between Islam and Shi’ism is the Islamic Kalimah. The rest of\nShi’ism has very little in common with mainstream Islam. The unbridgeable\ndivide between the two is entrenched in some of the core fundamentals of\nthis sect, such as:\n\n* THE TWELVE IMAAMS\n\nImaamah is a divine station like Nubuwwat. This implies that Sunnis, who do\nnot believe in Imaamah, are unbelievers. According to their beliefs, Allah\nhad chosen twelve men to succees Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). The\ntwelfth Imaam however disappeared at the age of five. He is believed to be\nthe awaited Mahdi.\n\n* THE STATUS OF THE IMAAMS\n\nThe Imaams possess more knowledge than the Ambiyaa. They are superior to the\nAmbiyaa and the entire creation. The Imaams can bring the dead back to life.\nNo knowledge of the heavens and the earth is hidden from them.\n\n* THE INTERPOLATION OF THE NOBLE QUR’AN\n\nThe Qur’an is incomplete and distorted in its present form. This tenet had\nbeen explicity propounded by the classical scholars of Shi’ism, but frugally\ndenied by the contemporary scholars.\n\n* VILIFICATION AND APOSTASY OF THE SAHAABA\n\nThe Sahaaba were guilty of wilfully distorting and corrupting the Deen of\nMuhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). They turned renegade after the\ndemise of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) except the immediate household\nof Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\n* THE PERMISSIBILITY OF MUT’A\n\n* VIRTUES OF TAQIYYA\n\nIslam and Shi’ism are two parallel streams of thought that can never\nconverge. They are as distinct from each other, as is Islam to the\nAhlul-Kitaab.To ignore these differences is to ignore the stark reality.\n\nThe often repeated hallowed call for “Muslim Unity” simply serves as a\nsmokescreen, behind which Shi’a missionaries penetrate Muslim societies. Any\nattempt to resist this imposition is branded as “divisive”. Would it be\ndivisive to protect Islam from a sect that inherently debases the Qur’an,\nthe Ambiyaa, and the Sahaaba? Unity can only be forged on the basis of\nAqeedah (belief). To label these differences as ‘hair splitting issues’ is\nto undermine the sanctity of the Qur’an, the Ambiyaa and the Sahaaba unity\nat the cost of the Qur’an is tantamount to blasphemy.\n\nThe constitution of our country guarantees religious freedom. The Shi’as\ntherefore have the right to propagate their beliefs. However, they need to\ncome out of the closet and do so under the banner of Shi’ism.\n\nIssued by: UUCSA"
