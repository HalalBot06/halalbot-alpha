  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaikum. Can you please advise as to the rules regarding payment of zakaat when there is an outstanding debt of Â£10,000? Also would it be irresponsible to have another child with such a debt? May Allah reward you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nKindly refer below.\n\nIt is not irresponsible to have a child despite being in debt. Each child comes with its own sustenance from Allah Ta?ala. We are merely a means for the child?s sustenance.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nQ: I have read in a book that if there is an outstanding debt of R120,000 on a house worth R120,000 the entire amount is exempt from Zakaat. Is that correct? If that is the case, one will not pay Zakaat for many years.\nA: The ruling contained in that book is incorrect. Only the amount that is due for one year will be regarded as a liability. (Shaami vol.3 pg.177; Lebanon)"
