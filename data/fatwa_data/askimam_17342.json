  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question relates to wearing Silk. As far as I understand the silk that comes from silk worm is not allowed. However if the garment is made of any synthetic silk or not 100% pure silk then will it be ok to wear the garment?\n\nAn example can be taken from ties. In the sub continent ties are cheap... even silk ties. Even though the tag says 100% but its not pure silk rather synthetic slik because pure silk will be too expensive. Question is not whether wearing ties is ok or not... rather if it will be ok wearing this kind of silk?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh  \n\nIt is permissible to wear synthetic silk.\n\nأما ما كان سداه حريرا ولحمته غير حرير فلا بأس بلبسه بلا خلاف بين العلماء وكان أبو حنيفة رحمه الله تعالى لا يرى بأسا بلبس الخز للرجال وإن كان سداه حريرا\n\n(Fatawa Hindiya p331 vol.5 Maktaba Rasheediya)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
