  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1.It is right for me  for me take admission in International islamic University,Islamabad Pakistan for education.\n\n2.it is necassary for every citizen to make id card in pakistan, and we have to go to office of Nadra where male persons took pic .will i  be sinful to make id card in this case.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. A woman’s place ideally is within the confines of her home. There is no need for you to attend university even if it is an ‘Islamic University’. A university is not the place for a woman.\n\n2. Since it is a necessity, you will not be sinful in taking a photograph. Request for a female to attend to you. As a last resort, a male may attend to you but in the company of your Mahram.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
