  "question": "1. Is alcohol from corn halal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI ask this because whisky is made from corn. And also this type of alcohol (from corn) is present in one of the ice creams I know. Would the ice cream then be halal or haram? 2. i have read in a hadeeth that if the food is left uncovered then wabaal comes on it. what does wabaal mean? does that mean that you shouldn't leave food uncovered for even 5 , 10 minutes or is it saying that do not leave food uncovered ovrenight. so if left uncovered should you not eat it? please clarify.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Alcohol from grapes and dates is haraam regardless of whether the quantity taken could intoxicate one or not. All other types of alcohol are such that a minute amount that cannot intoxicate one, will be classified as permissible as long as they are not consumed for amusement in the manner of the sinners and kuffaar. Whisky contains such a large percentage of alcohol that could intoxicate one, thus whisky is haraam even if made from corn alcohol.%0D%0A%0D%0AIce creams generally contain such a small percentage of alcohol that could not intoxicate, thus if the alcohol is from corn and is in a minute quantity, then it would be permissible. One should be cautious as recently a range of alcoholic ice-creams were launched that contain such a large amount of alcohol that could intoxicate. Such ice-creams would not be permissible.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The hadith clearly mentions that this is with regard to food and drink left open for the night. Such food should not be consumed. Leaving food open during the day will not fall under the ambit of this hadith.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
