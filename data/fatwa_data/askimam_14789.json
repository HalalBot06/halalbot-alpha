  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to ask a question in relation to marriage.  I got enaged about a year ago, it was an arranged marriage.  I was happy with the decisoin and assumed that my fiance was to.  However, in between this time he was still talking to other girls and was close to one non Muslim girl in particular.  I was not aware of this at the time. Through the 8 months we were enaged he was arrogant and disrespectful to me and had no feelings for me.  I gave him chance after chance so he would change and prayed to Allah SWT that he makes our relationship stronger.  I remained strong and kept faith in Allah and went thorough the engagement.  We got married and Mash Allah evrything was okay.  Then after a few weeks there was alot of family inteference as he was the only son his mother tried to create arguments and fights between us and wasn't happy that we where getting on with each other.  Alot of misunderstandings sprung up and caused distance between us all my feelings for my husband just never remained the same but still i try to put 100% effort into the marriage becuase i want it to work.  However, in between this time my husband sent me home becuase he was mentally strained from all the nagging and pressure and told me not to come back.  I was so hurt and upset how could this possibly happen 2months into my marriage?? then he did come to get me back to save the respect of families.  At present there are still no changes my mother in law talks bad about me to other family friends and says things infront of me to make me seem like the bad one.  My husband has no respect for me and says hurtful things he has no true feelings for me.  I'm just kept there as another person they have not made me feel part of the fmaily etc.  We have our separate flat next door to my in laws.  Now he is suggesting we move into thier house which is a really small house knowing that we all do not get on and there will not be enough room for us all to stay and we will have no privcacy.  He has said to me we should move in or he will consider divorcing me! Am i wrong to say no i will not move in? and how long do i stay with a family who don't accpet me as a duaghter in law and a husban that dosen't treat me like a wife or supports me in any way.  I am currently working and support myself and pay for half the mortgage.  I  married with the intention to live with him forever but things have not really worked out.  Now i feel as if i will be committing a sin if i decide to leave him? or i will have to suffer through life and live with them and be unhappy.  Please guide me acordding to the correcr ways of Islam.  Jazak Ullah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is our advise that you discuss your predicament with the seniors of your family and also make Istikhara.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
