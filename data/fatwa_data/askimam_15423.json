  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am very concerned.I set my alarm for Fajr every morning.But i fail to wake up.Please help me and tell me how i can solve this problem.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh  \n\nIf you have conditioned your mind to wake up, then most certainly you would. The alarm clock may assist you to wake up, but you will have to take the initiative to get off the bed and go for Salaah.\n\nIn order for you to understand consider the following example. What if a noble and respectable person promised that he would give you $1000 tomorrow if you perform your Fajr at a particular Masjid. What would be your condition? You would ensure that you are early for the Fajr and wait for the money. This would be the case of many people who do not perform their Fajr Salaah with Jamaat (congregation) in the Masjid. Since we have the value of money before us, the will to go to obtain the money is almost certain. One would be grieved for the entire day if not the month if he/she missed such an opportunity.\n\nHowever, Allah has promised far more than the $1000. Rasulullah () said \"Whoever performs Fajr Salaah with congregation he is in the protection/guard of Allah\". Certainly the protection of Allah is sufficient than the entire treasures of the earth. In order to gain the strength and be motivated to wake up for Fajr, you must read those Ahadith wherein the virtues are recorded for those who perform the Fajr with congregation. Together with reading the virtues, one must also read the warnings and harms for the neglect of Salaah with congregation. Fazaail e Amaal is an ideal read for such Ahadith. \n\n \n\nTogether with having an alarm clock, you should supplicate sincerely to Allah to wake you up for Salaah at the appointed time. We advise you to keep a very loud bell alarm clock and that too at a distance in which you will be compelled to come out of bed to put it off. Then think that this sound is not irritating, then what about the sound of Qiyamat?\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
