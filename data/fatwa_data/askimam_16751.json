  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am living in Jeddah which is inside the Miqat. I am staying here from last 2 year. I performed Hajj e Ifrad in last session Alhumdulillah. I have some doubt for your clarification that which I performed with my Hajj Group as below: 1)  We went directly to Mina from Jeddah without performing Tawaf-e-Qodum in Makkah. 2) And returned directly to Jeddah from Mina without performing Tawaf-e-Wida in Makkah. 3)  \n\nAt Arafah we performed prayers 4(Dhuhr) 4(Asr) rekah as usual neither combine Dhuhr and Asr nor follow Qasr. 4) At Muzdalifah we performed prayers 3(Maghrib) 4(Isha) rekah as usual neither combined Maghrib and Isha nor followed Qasr.\n\n\n\n\nPlease suggest in light of Islam that this action is valid or I need to perform Hajj again. Jazakum Allah Khayran\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1. Tawaf Al-Qudum (the welcoming tawaf) is also known as Tawaf At-Tahiyat (the tawaf of greeting and salutation to the house of Allah Ta’ala). Upon entering the blessed land of Makka one should first go to the haram and perform this Tawaf. However if a resident of Jeddah does not perform Tawaf Al-Qudum he will be excused.\n(Mu’allam Al-Hujajj, Idarat Al-Quran)\n\nTawaf Al-Wida [farewell tawaf] is not Wajib on a resident of Jeddah. However, it is meritorious as that is on expression of respect to the Bayt-Allah.\n (Ahsan Al-Fatawa Vol.5, Pg.539, H.M Saeed)\n\n2. On the day of Arafat one will make jamah of Dhur and Asr salat if he is praying behind the imam [of Arafat] in Masjid Namirah. If one is not praying Dhur and Asr [of the first jamat] behind the imam in Masjid Namirah or is praying individually, he is not allowed to make jamah of Dhur and Asr. Only a musafir will make Qasr in Arafat, a muqem should complete his salat and not observe Qasr. \n (Aap Ka Masail Vol.4, Pg.126, Maktaba Bayanat)\n(Mu’allam Al-Hujajj Pg.181, Idarat Al-Quran)\n\n3. It is necessary to make jamah of magrib and e’sha in Muzdalifa and only a musafir will make Qasr in Muzadalifa.\n(Aap Ka Masail Vol.4, Pg.126&127, Maktaba Bayanat) \n\nIn the case mentioned in your e-mail if the people were Musafirs and did not make Qasr salat, their salat will be valid. However if they did not perform Tawaf Al-Ziyarah, the Hajj will have to be repeated.\n (Fatawa Mahmodiya Vol.7, Pg.507, Darul uloom Karachi)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
