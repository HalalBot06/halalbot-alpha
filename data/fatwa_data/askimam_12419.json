  "question": "Is it okay to name a boy as Taha or Taâ€™ha?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it okay to name a boy as Taha ? the first two letters of Surah. Is there any issue to name boys like Yaseen, Taha. Is Yaseen and Taha names of Holy Prophet (SAW) ? some says this is not correct. Please see this link - http://www.zawaj.com/articles/names_prohibited.html Also can we name a girl as Emaan Fatima?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe view that names such as Taha and Yasin are undesirable is not the view of the majority of the 'ulama. In fact, amongst the major Imams this view is held only by Imam Malik.\n\nThe claim that names such as these are meaningless is also not absolutely correct. It has been narrated from Sayyiduna Imam Muhammad al-Baqir, a great-great-grandson of Rasulullah sallallahu `alayhi wasallam, who was a great imam during the time of the Tabi'in, that the name Taha is one of the names of Rasulullah sallallahu `alayhi wasallam. There are other views too, on the meaning of this name.\n\nIn light of the fact that the opinion which discourages this kind of name is (1) relatively marginalised, and (2) does not rest upon persuasive shar'I proof, it will not be undesirable to give a child any of these names, nor will it be necessary to change the name once already given.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
