  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a 27 year old female and in dec 2010, with involvement of both families, we did nikkah. However, my in laws said we will take a time for ruksati till next year April 2012. I cant wait till then because already 4 year passed of our love. We wait to agree both parents but now they are asking for more time. I want to ask you is it good? What we should do what Islam said about ruksati after nikkah ? How much time we should take for complete marriage? what about my rights after nikkah? Can i claim about that?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nWhen a nikah takes place, the married boy and girl are now husband and wife to each other. It is their shar’i right to be with each other to fulfill their emotional and natural demands.\n\nThe very purpose of nikah was to legitimize this relationship. Alhamdu Lillah, you and your husband exercised restraint and married only after both families consented to the marriage. The purpose of a rukhsati is when a marriage takes place suddenly, and the girl is not prepared to stay with her husband immediately, time is given to her to prepare her basic needs to be able to stay with her husband. For that, a short period of a month or so is sufficient. To delay the rukhsati for a year is unreasonable. If you are prepared to live with your husband immediately, he is bound to provide shelter for you, clothe you as well as maintain you. If he does not fulfill those marital obligations to you, he is guilty of violating the shari’ah law of maintaining you which is a major sin. You and your husband should discuss your concerns with some prominent person who has influence on the boys family to address and remedy your concerns.\n\n \nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n \nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
