  "question": "Is it allowed in Islam, for women to play sports, so long as no mean can see them at all?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPlaying sports in Islam will be permissible after considering the reasons for playing. In a Hadith, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) permitted 3 types of playing, a) Playing with one?s wife, b) Archery and, c) Riding a Horse.\n\nThe purpose of these sports were to keep fit. Keeping this in mind, if we play sports in such a manner that no Shar?ee rule is broken, it would be in order. Great care should be taken that Hijaab is adhered to. Today, we hear of many women going to gyms, wearing skimmy clothing and training next to each other including men as though they are training their eyes and thoughts.\n\nIn brief, sports is permissible for females provided laws of Hijaab are adhered to. It is also necessary these sports are beneficial and not harmful to one?s body, mind and soul.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
