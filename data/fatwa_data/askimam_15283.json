  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nwhich quraanic verse describe the prayer timings and prohibition for ladies to go outside without hijab\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe Quran does not state the details of different salah times. That is in the hadith. Jibraeel (AS) came down for two days after the incident of Meraj and made imamat for Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم). In the first day he performed the salats in the commencing times for each salat, and on the second day, he performed the salaats at the ending time for each salah. Jibraeel (AS) then told Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) that the times of salah are between those two times. (Tirmizi)\n\n2.      The laws of hijab are in Sura Noor in the 18th Juz of the Quran and in Sura Ahzaab in the 22nd Juz of the Quran.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
