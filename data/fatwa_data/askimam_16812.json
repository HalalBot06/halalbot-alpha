  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs that permissible to read Surahs From the Holy Quran during Tahajjud of Sunnah Prayer\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nYour query is not clear.Â  It appears you wish to enquire about holding the Quran and reading from the Quran. If so, it is not permissible to hold the Quran in salah and read from the Quran. One may read any surahs of the Quran one knows in tahajjud salah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
