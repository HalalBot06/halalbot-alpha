  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamualaikum, Where in Sharia does it say a muslim government (taliban) can beat men and women with sticks or other forms of beatings for NOT keeping a beard or for showing a little skin at the ankle ? Is this a correct interpreta- tion of islamic sharia ? I personally have seen video and pictures of the taliban beating muslims for these reasons. Can you please provide proof from the Quran and Sunnah. The muslims are very divided on the issue of Taliban practicing correct sharia, so much to the point that they are calling them 'fake' muslims that dont know what Islam is. This must be cleared up. Please help. Jazakallahkhairun.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is the responsibility of a Muslim government to implement the laws of\nShari'ah including keeping a beard or Hijaab, etc. among its Muslim\ncitizens.\n\nAny suitable means adopted to achieve that is a matter of administration and\npermissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
