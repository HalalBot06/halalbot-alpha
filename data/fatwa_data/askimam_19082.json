  "question": "Should one participate in Janazah Salah in the Masjid?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPraying Janazah prayers in the Mosque is Makruh. So if such prayers are being performed in the Mosque where the daily and Jumah prayers are performed Should I participate?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nAccording to the Hanafi school of thought, it is makruh tahreemi to offer Janazah Salah in the Masjid which has been built for the five daily salah, the Jumuah Salah or the Eid salah, whether the Janazah is offered inside the masjid or the Janazah is placed outside while the people are standing inside.1\n\nIf there is no place outside the masjid or there is another valid reason, then offering the salah of Janazah in the masjid is not makruh.2 3\n\nIf the trustees and/or the Imam of the Masjid follow the Hanafi school of thought, one should advise them of the reprehensibility of praying the Janazah Salah in the Masjid if one is capable of doing that.\n\nIf the Imam and/or the trustees do not take heed and if there are enough people to fulfill the fard kifaayah of praying the Janazah Salah, its better not to participate as a way of showing disapproval with the intention of Islaah (rectification).4\n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMl.
