  "answer": "QUESTION\nI heard that wearing ring containing stones (green, red, blue, etc.) in it, is proven to be baraka and changes someone?s fate. Is it a sunnah? can you please give us details in light of sunnah & quran-e-kareem in this regard. I would be thankful for your help\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTa'weez means to seek protection from Allah. It is permissible to use Aayaat of Qur'an and authentically established Duas for such purposes. (Mirqaat Vol.9 Pg. 360).\n\nWhen utilizing these means, ones intention should always be to seek Allah's protection. If the belief enters the heart that it is the Ta'weez itself that brings luck or protection, then it is Shirk indeed and must be shunned.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
