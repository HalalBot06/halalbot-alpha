  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsslamu-alaikum, i have a serious issue that i need answering. My wife and i have been arguing alot and to get to the point we had an argument where i said to her in a moment of anger \"that am going to divorce you,\" and in gujrati \"ja mei nei ta nei talaaq aa pee dee dee\". I was in shock myself after saying these words and walked out of the house. After 2 hours i phoned my wife. She said to me to come home as she heard the word \"talaaq\" once and kept nagging me about it. So  i said that \"i meant what i said as i meant all 3 and now for us to live together we would be committing a great sin, its over now\" and put that phone down. During the course of our argument, i must state that there was a 5 minute silence and in this time i thought to myself that if i dont end it here it will always be the same. At the time when i did say the words for divorce, i had no such intention in uttering those words. Another thing i would like to mention is this dream i once had where i was at my parents house and my wife in the kitchen. I am then coming down the steps and my father in law comes up to me and kisses me on my forehead for divorcing his daughter, though in the dream no such words are being uttered, and wonder if this dream means anything. One last question, can one give interest money to the mosque for spending on the wuzu khana and toliet area. I ask this as some of my friends have said we can. May Allah reward you for your kind efforts, aameen.                      Walaikum-salaam\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn order for us to issue a ruling, kindly clarify the following:\n\n1. Did you say the words of Talaaq in English or Gujarat?\n\n2. You state ‘I meant what I said as I meant all 3’. What do you mean by this statement?\n\nAccording to the Shari’ah, it is necessary to dispose of interest money by giving it to the poor and needy. It is not permissible to give interest money to the Musjid for building the toilets and Wudhu Khana.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
