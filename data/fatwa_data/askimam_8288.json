  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam plz tell me de meaning of zayyan & safiyah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFirst and foremost, it must be understood that Allah Ta?ala has decreed that some women will remain barren no matter what. It is His will alone that will dominate. We do understand your natural wish of motherhood. Continue making Du?aa. Allah Ta?ala knows what is best for his servants. Sometimes, children may become a curse to the parents. That is why He does not bestow children to some couple as He wishes good for them.\n\nContinue reciting the following Du?aas. Recite these Du?aas after every Fardh Salaat:\n\na. Rabbi hab liy minas saaliheen\n\nb. Rabbi hab liy min ladunka dhurriyyatan twayyibatan\n\nc. Rabbanaa hab lanaa min azwaajinaa wa dhurriyyaatinaa qurrata a?ayunin wa-j-alnaa lil muttaqeena imaama\n\nZayyaan ? handsome. Safiyyah ? the chosen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
