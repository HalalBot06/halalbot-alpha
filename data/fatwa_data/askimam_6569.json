  "question": "I am intrested in a guy to get marry and he is equally intrested, can you refer something to read for Allah to tie us in this relationship.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am intrested in a man to get marry and he is equally intrested, as our intentions are very clean and right so hopefully with the blessing of Allah Almighty we will get marry but can you refer me something to read to get marry without any hindrence.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo have the intention to marry is a very noble one and is fullfilling on of the Sunnahs of our Beloved Prophet Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and thus one of the corner stones of the social structures of Islam. But choosing the right person can be very demanding on a person that is why Islam has given us the practice of Mashwara (consulting) and Salaatul Isthikharah.\n\nYou should consult with responsible people as well as make this Salaah before making a decision. Do not be hasty and do not follow your feelings and emotions blindly. Also after every Salaah make a lot of Du?aa as you may know that Dua is a weapon of the believer. May Allaah guide in your decision.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
