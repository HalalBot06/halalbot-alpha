  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is Sunnat-e-Muakkadah to give Adhaan and Iqaamat for Adaa (performed%0D%0Aon time) prayers as well as Qadhaa prayers. (Shaami). There will be no%0D%0AAdhaan for Qadhaa prayers if the Qadhaa prayers is performed in a Musjid.%0D%0A(Ibid)%0D%0A2. In today's times when evil and corruption is so common and rife, every%0D%0Aindividual must taken it upon himself%2Fherself to protect and guard against%0D%0Athe soul being corrupted. Hereunder, are some guidelines to guard one's soul%0D%0Aand spirituality.%0D%0Aa. Be punctual in performing the five daily Salaats. A male must ensure he%0D%0Aperforms Salaat with Jamaat in the Musjid.%0D%0Ab. Recite some portion of the Qur'aan daily. It is also important to read%0D%0Athe translation and commentary of the Qur'aan daily. We recommend the%0D%0Afollowing English translations: Muhammad Pickthall (Translation); Muhsin%0D%0AKhan (Translation); Tafseer-e-Usmani (with commentary); Daryabadi (with%0D%0Acommentary); Maariful Qur%E3n (with commentary). NB. Any translation of the%0D%0ANoble Qur%E3n must be accompanied with the Arabic text next to the%0D%0Atranslation.%0D%0Ac. Recite the following three Tasbeehs any time in the morning or evening,%0D%0A100 times Istighfaar, 100 times third Kalimah, 100 times Durood upon%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). The above three Tasbeehaat should%0D%0Abe read in isolation and concentration.%0D%0Ad. Always display good character even in front of one's enemies.%0D%0Ae. Avoid intermingling with the opposite gender and lower one's gaze. Do not%0D%0Alet the mind and heart be polluted with the form and shape of the opposite%0D%0Agender. That is death to spirituality.%0D%0Af. Stay in the company of the pious. Bad company is detrimental to one's%0D%0AImaan and character.%0D%0Ag. Be conscious of life after death and accountability in the court of Allah%0D%0ATa'ala.%0D%0Ah. Keep in touch with reliable Ulama. Make their Ikraam (honour) and seek%0D%0Atheir esteemed guidance.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe hope if one follows the above points, he%2Fshe will be protected from the%0D%0Atricks of the Shaytaan.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
