  "question": "the 3 ways duas are accepted? good ways to make dua?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs ok to ask ALLAH to remove all want from your heart, and replace it with only what Allah wants..in other words, praying 'Ya Allah let me only desire ans wish for because this is what you have wished for me, and not out of my own decisions and foolishness.' - is that a wise and good way to ask ALLAH -Is it ok for marriage for Rizq, and for general - or is there a more appropriate dua that was taught to us?? -Allah make me maaf if wrong for asking !\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYes, it is permissible for one to supplicate to Allah whatever he/she\nwishes. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'The Du'aa of a servant is\naccepted until he/she supplicates for a sin or for the cutting off any\nfamily ties.' (Mishkaat pg.194; Qadeemi)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
