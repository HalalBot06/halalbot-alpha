  "answer": "QUESTION\nis it necessary to obtain a islamic divorce certificate and how can this be done few years after the event? as hwe\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn order for a divorce to be valid, a certificate is not required. If one fears possible denial of the divorce later on, then obtaining a certificate would be better. This would also apply if there exists the possibility of the divorce being contested in a court of law.\n\nIn order to obtain such a certificate, you would be advised to go to you local Ulama council and ask them for one.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
