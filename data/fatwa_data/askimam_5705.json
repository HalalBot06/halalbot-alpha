  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Imam Please Help Me, My husband left me couple of months back as he could not give up the affair that he was having with a non muslim woman. But earlier he was a good muslim. I am sure he is un aware about the path that he is going right now. Can I repent from Allah (SWT) on behalf of him. I want to put him on the right path. I feel very guilty about his behavior, how much ever I tell him he is not listening to me. What can I do to make him a pious person ? Please help me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala says in the noble Qur'aan, 'Continue advising for verily\nadvising is beneficial to believers.'\n\nYou state you have advised your husband many times and he does not seem to\nlisten. You should continue offering him advice and also make Du'aa to\nAllah. Du'aa is the strongest weapon of a believer. You should also make Du'\naa to Allah to guide you in advising your husband. Insha Allah, Allah will\nguide you.\n\nNever give up and have full conviction that Allah's help will come. You\nshould also seek the assistance of your local Ulama and pious people. They\nmay befriend him and offer him advice as well.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
