  "question": "can we use some of the time in the company to reply email / phone calls of our brothers in regard to deeni matters",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nass. wr.wb. 1. If we are working for a company, can we use some of the time in the company to reply some email / phone calls of our brothers in regard to deeni matters. 2. In our masjid we don't have a permanent imam. So, one brother usually appointed or voluntarily become the imam. The problem is, sometimes some of the brothes does not like few particular brothers to become imam (e.g due to hatred/personal problems, the recitation is not correct etc.). Therefore, they are pushing me to become imam, eventhough some of them are arab brothers. I am not an alim nor a hafiz, but the brothers thought that my recitation is alright, and I am acceptable to everyone. I don't like to become imam, since I am not an Arab speaker and sometime I got nervous and make mistake in the recitation (forgotten or wrong ayat). Should I move forward to become imam or not? jazakallah wass. wr.w b.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. According to the Shari'ah, the services of an employee falls in the\ncategory of Ijaarah (hiring). The employer and employee will be bound by the\ncontractual agreement between themselves. Generally, an employee is paid for\nhis services and time. It is incorrect to use the company's time as well as\nthe company's resources for personal matters without prior consent from the\nemployer.\n2.
