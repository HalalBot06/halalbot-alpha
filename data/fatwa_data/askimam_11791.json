  "answer": "QUESTION\nDONT DELETE!IF YOUR A MUSLIM! PLEASE READ THIS!This is true.From Madina Sheikh Ahmed has sent this news.On a Friday Sheikh Ahmed fell asleep reading the Quraan.He dreamt the Prophet Muhammed(SAW) standing in front of him and saying that in 1 week 7000 people died but not even one was a true Muslim.None did what ALLAH wanted.He also said now is a bad time.These days Wives dont look after their Husbands,Girls go round without being covered they do not respect parents or others,Rich do not look after the poor,they do not fulfil zakaat.The day of judgement is near. When there is a single star in the sky,straight away the path of forgiveness will close.The writing in the Quraan will disappear (vanish).The Sun will lower itself with earth.The Prophet said whoever reads this news to someone else,\"I WILL ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT MAKE HIM A PLACE IN PARADISE,AND IF SOMEONE DOES NOT BELIEVE THIS NEWS TO BE TRUE THEY WILL BE BANISHED FROM PARADISE\".If a poor person gives out this news to other people his/her good wish will come true.Sheikh Ahmed said if this is not true then my death will be off a Non-Muslim.Whoever Forwards This will get his/her reward in three days. One Person forward it to 40 people he had 8,000 thousand, take prophit in his buisness.One Person did not believe this news and his son died.One kept Saying he will forward it today,tomorrow but never forward this news he died as well.PLEASE DO NOT THINK THIS IS NOT TRUE.PLEASE FORWARD THIS TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis is like the letter of 'Shaykh Ahmadu of Madina' which is still in circulation and unfortunately unwary Muslims continue to believe in it. Hundres of copies are regularly made and distributed to Muslims and until recently people are receiving it in the post. Furthermore, now the internet and electronic mail is used to intensify the campaign.\n\nWe have previously warned Muslims about such publications. In our opinion, the above unauthored letter and information is probably of the same nature and Muslims are advised to disregard it totally.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
