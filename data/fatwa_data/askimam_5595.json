  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi school it is Sunnah for circumcision to be performed%0D%0Afor a new born as well as a person who accepts Islam . According to the%0D%0Aother schools it is wajib. (Radd al-Muhtar v.7 p.342 Dar al-Fikr 1995)%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said: \"The practices related to%0D%0AFitrah (natural human ways) are five: Circumcision, shaving the pubic hair,%0D%0Atrimming the moustache, pairing the nails and removing the hair of the%0D%0Aarmpits.\" - Sahih al-Bukhari%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said: \"Circumcision is Sunnah for%0D%0Amen and an honour for women\" - Musnad Ahmad, Al-Bayhaqi%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) also said: \"Whoever accepts Islam%0D%0Ashould have his circumcision perfomed.\" - Talkhis al-Habir%0D%0A%0D%0AIn one hadith in Musnad Ahmad the words \"get rid of the hair of disbelief%0D%0Aand perform circumcision\" have been recorded.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe practice of circumcision is one of the salient features (sha`a'ir) of%0D%0Athe religion of Islam. It is from amongst those things that Rasulullah%0D%0A(sallallahu alayhi wasallam) encouraged his ummah to follow the way (millah)%0D%0Aof Hadrat Ibrahim (alayhis salam) in. Hadrat Ibrahim (alayhis salam) was the%0D%0Afirst person to be circumcised at the age of 80. (Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih%0D%0AMuslim)%0D%0A%0D%0ABesides the above, circumcision also carries numerous physical benefits. It%0D%0Aalso prevents many illnesses.%0D%0A%0D%0AFurthermore circumcision is an important aspect of taharah%0D%0A(cleanliness),which is so strongly emphasised in Islam, for when the%0D%0Aforeskin is not removed, urine and other secretions can collect under the%0D%0Afolded skin.This area can become the site of very painful infections from%0D%0Abacterial growth and the minor operation of circumcision greatly simplifies%0D%0Abasic hygiene for men and boys. \"Indeed God loves those who turn to Him%0D%0Aconstantly and He loves those who keep themselves pure\" - Qur'an Surah%0D%0Aal-Baqarah%0D%0A%0D%0AHence it is a greatly meritorious sunnah as well as physically beneficial to%0D%0Aperform this act. However it is not a pre-requisite for conversion to Islam.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
