This problem takes away my confidence and now i'm suffering from high inferiority complex. I can't sustain this problem. Even my freinds teases me very often. I can't even able to go out and face the society caz i have the fear of getting teased by one or the other. So i thought of planting my hair jus because to avoid all sort of pains and teasing by my freinds and society and not for beauty purpose. Is this act permissible in Islam or not. If it isn't permisible kindly tell me the reason as well as the solution caz this priblem is killing me day to day i can't withstand it.\n\n\n \nAwaiting for yr reply, hope u do me a favour.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nThe Dārul Iftā has conducted a research on the topic of Hair Transplant. Hereunder, we present a synopsis of the research:\n\n \n\nIn principle, Islām is not opposed to medical treatment as long as it does not involve distortion and adjustment to the human body.  Hair transplant is a restoration of hair by redistributing hair from areas of high density to areas that are bald. It does not involve distortion to the human body.\n\n \n\nBaldness is a defect. Hair transplant assists in purging this defect. The Fuqahā (Jurists) have permitted the removal of defect by means of treatment. Hence, hair transplant is permissible.\n\n \n\nHowever, it is important to note that the permissibility of hair transplant is not general, but restricted to cases of necessity. Hair transplant will only be permissible when an individual undergoes psychological or social difficulties due to baldness.\n\n \n\nIn reply to your query, we state:\n\nIt will be permissible for you to undergo hair transplant, considering the fact that you are young and baldness is a defect that affects you psychologically. \n\n \n\nHowever, we advise that you consult an experienced dermatologist and seek an alternative method before undergoing hair transplant. There have been reports of patients that have not found hair transplant successful.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
