  "question": "What is the benefits of the dua after fard salaah made by the imaam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI notice many people carry on reading tasbeeh on their fingers and not lift their hands while the Imaam is making the dua after the fard salaah.They only lift their hands after they have finished. Is this allowed or does it reduce the blessings ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhile the Imaam is busy making Du'aa the people behind him should also join\nhim as there is more Barakah in doing so together.\n\nHowever, since this is only preferable, they are not compelled to do so.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
