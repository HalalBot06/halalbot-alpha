  "question": "Why do the eyes of the deceased open after death?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI was asked recently why the eyes of a marhum (deceased), opens after death or during ghusal. Could you please assist me in this matter? I would like to know why this happens? Does a murhum feel pain?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nUmme Salma [Radhiallaahu anha] states that when her husband Abu Salama passed away, Rasulullah [Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] entered the house and his eyes were left open starring. Rasulullah [Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] closed the eyes and said ‘When a person dies, his eyes follow.’ (Mishkaat pg.148)\n\nThat is, there is no point in leaving the eyes open as there is no life which give light in the eyes.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
