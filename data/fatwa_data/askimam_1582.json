  "question": "Are women allowed to pray in their own congregational prayer?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0AA male should perform his Salaat with Jamaat in the Masjid. Salaat with%0D%0AJamaat in the Masjid is 25 times superior than Salaat performed at home. The%0D%0AProphet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) admonished men reading Salaat in the%0D%0AMasjid. Women should read Salaat individually in their homes. The Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, \"The Salaat of women in the inner part%0D%0Aof their house is more virtuous than the Salaat made in the general part of%0D%0Athe house.\" (Mishkat)%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, if a male Mahram for some legitimate Shar'ee reason did not read%0D%0Ahis Salaat in the Masjid, he may read his Salaat with the women of the house%0D%0A(mother, sister, wife, etc.) with Jamaat provided the women stand behind the%0D%0Amale.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is Makrooh for females to read their Salaat with Jamaat. Every female%0D%0Ashould read her Salaat individually. The females should not lead their own%0D%0AJamaat or follow the males Jamaat. It is permissible for the females to read%0D%0Atheir Salaat individually while the males read their Salaat separately with%0D%0AJamaat. It is reported from Hadhrat Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu) saying, \" woman%0D%0Amust not lead the Salaat.\" Therefore, it is incorrect for a woman to lead%0D%0Athe Salaat and for the other females to follow. We find this practice was%0D%0Anot encouraged (that women make their own Jamaat) at the time of Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). There is no reported incident of women%0D%0Aleading the prayer during the time of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) and during the period of the Khulafaa-e-Raashideen.%0D%0A%0D%0ASalaat is a means of earning the Mercy and Blessings of Allah Ta'ala. It%0D%0Ashould therefore be performed in the best manner possible. However, to%0D%0Adeliberately indulge in an act of Makrooh-e-Tahrimi is to earn the%0D%0Adispleasure of Allah Ta'ala. These two aspects therefore cannot be%0D%0Areconciled.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
