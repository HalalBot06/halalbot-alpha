  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it possible that one reads the meaning in any language while residing Qur'an in arabic in order to understand the Qur'an or any other knowledge is needed. Some people says one cannot directly understand Qura'n they should seat with aalim to understand? I am bit confuse what to do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Qur'aan is the word of Allah and has very deep meanings. If one knows\nArabic he may understand the literal meaning of the verses of the noble Qur'\naan.\n\nHowever, the indept meaning could be understood by studying the sciences of\nthe principles of the commentary of the Qur'aan and the commentary itself.\nIf the Qur'aan was sufficient, there would be no need for a Prophet. In\nfact, one of the purposes of the Prophet was to teach the meaning of the Qur\n'aan, hence, Ahaadith.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
