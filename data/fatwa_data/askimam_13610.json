  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. We are packing boxes with foodstuff e.g. milk/tea/rice/beans etc etc for distribution to the poor - Is it permissable to use Zakaat money for this?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to Shariah, zakaat may be given in cash or kind. Therefore you may use zakaat money for distribution of foodstuff. However, it is important that the goods reach the poor and needy. If the goods are not distributed to the recipients of zakaat, the zakaat will not be discharged.\n\nTherefore, you should hand the goods over to a reliable as well as reputable organization who are sensitive to the Laws of Shariah and who will discharge of the zakaat in the correct way.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
