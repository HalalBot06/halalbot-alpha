  "question": "What is the Islamic view on the concept of LUCK? Can one wish someone ‘Good Luck’ or ‘Best of Luck’? As a Muslim can I believe in “Nahoosat” or ‘Bad Luck’?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n* What?s the Islamic alternative to wishing ?Best of Luck?? It almost seems like one is crediting something other than Allah s.w.t. for something good, and blaming something else for anything bad that happens.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two aspects here. The first part is to verbally greet someone with%0D%0A'best of luck' or 'good luck', etc.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf this is said to somebody about to participate in something permissible%0D%0Aand within the limits of Shari'ah, e.g. examination, race, etc. then it will%0D%0Abe permissible provided that one does not have the belief it is because of%0D%0Ahis good luck wishing that the person will be successful. Words like 'best%0D%0Aof luck' and 'good luck' may be used for non-Muslims with the intention of%0D%0Awinning their hearts as an invitation towards Islam. Alternatively, for%0D%0AMuslims, one should abstain from these words and rather say, 'May Allah Ta'%0D%0Aala make you successful'.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe second aspect is with regards to belief in luck. In Islam, there is no%0D%0Asuch a thing as 'superstition'. Therefore, it will be incorrect for a person%0D%0Ato believe in luck and superstition. To have this belief that something bad%0D%0Aor good happens because of some superstition or luck is incorrect.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
