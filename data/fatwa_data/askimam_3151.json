  "question": "Nazar from aggrieved family without child.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Mufti saheb, Is it possible that if one family have everything except child, and they need child desperately, have bad nazar. All (Three) families around this family are found to be effected by those thing which that Bad nazar family don't have.i.e, peace and happiness, affect on children etc., Almost all bad incidents coincided with them. And those things which that bad family (husband wife) don't know are not affected. I came into the refuge of Allah by prayers and Dua and avioding almost all forbidden things. . What can I do to protect the other two families.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt does not mean that if one does not have children then he/she is affected\nby nazar. Allah Taala out of his wisdom at times does not grant a couple\nany children. He has clearly mentioned in the Quraan \"and He renders barren\nwhom He wills.\" (verse 50, chapter 42) Hence being deprived of any bounty\ndoes not mean that one is affected by nazar.\n\nSimilarly, trials and tribulations that afflict us from time to time are not\nnecessarily as a result of nazar. They come to us mainly as a redemption of\nour sins and to test the strength of our perserverance.\n\nAlhamdulillah, continue with your supplications to Allah Taala.You may also\nrecite the \"three quls\" i.e Surah Ikhlaas, Falaq and Naas, three times\nevery morning and evening and encourage others to do so.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
