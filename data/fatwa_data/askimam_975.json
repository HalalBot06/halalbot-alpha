  "question": "At computer bureau business, there are mostly females doing the capturing of data. How would I tackle this from a shariat point of view. Behaviour towards them,attitude, when speaking to them etc.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nShari'ah prohibits a male to communicate with Ghayr Mahram (not Haraam to\nmarry) females. Due to need and necessity, the prohibition is relaxed only\naccording to the need. Therefore, if you are required to communicate with\nGhayr Mahaarim females and there is no Shar'ee adequate alternative, then\nyou will be excused for communicating with them.\n\nHowever, you should ensure: a) Never to be in isolation with a Ghayr Mahram\nfemale, and b) Confine the communication only to the extent of the work\nwithout free talking and joking.\n\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'When a strange male and\nfemale are in isolation, the third is Shaytaan'.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
