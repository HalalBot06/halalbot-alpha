  "question": "When is ones dua accepted on Friday, before the quthbah, whilst the quthbah is on or after the quthbah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nand mufti what dua can be recited for a person to get a better job.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Ahaadith, there is a specific time where the Du'aas of a\nperson are accepted on the day of Jummu'ah. However, there is a difference\nof opinion amongst the scholars as to which is the correct and specific\ntime. One such opinion is the time between the two Khutbahs. This opinion is\nsupported by a narration in Muslim (vol.1 pg.181). Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) states that the time of acceptance is between the time when the\nImaam sits on the Minbar uptil the termination of the Jummu'ah Salaat.\n\nIn light of the above, it will be permissible to make Du'aa between the two\nKhutbahs. However, since there are other Ahaadith preventing a person from\ndoing any other action (physically or verbally) besides listening\nattentively to the Khutbah, it will not be permissible to make Du'aa\nverbally and by raising the hands. Instead, one should, without raising the\nhands, make Du'aa in his heart.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala"
