  "question": "This ramadaan I want to sit in a I'tikaaf. What I want to know is that can I still sit in itikaaf and do 9 and a half day and make up after ramadaan for a day?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThis ramadaan I want to sit in a I'tikaaf. I have taken last 3 weeks off. But still in the last week I have to come to office for half a day, that's what my employer has said because its closing of the month for the company. What I want to know is that can I still sit in itikaaf and do 9 and a half day and make up after ramadaan for a day? Is this allowed or should I not do it at all? Can I sit in itikaaf even if my parents wouldn't allow me to? I read in Kitaabus sawm about itikaaf, that it is makrooh for person in itikaaf to maintain total silence. I don't understand this. If I am to be alone in my room with whom should I talk? I thought we shouldn't talk idly during itikaaf. Or does it mean that if someone asks me something I can reply and that I can also ask someone to give me for e.g. food?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The Sunnah I?tikaaf covers the entire period of the last ten days of Ramadhaan. We suggest you sit for Nafl I?tikaaf instead. Nafl I?tikaaf can even be for a little while.\n\n2. If your parents prevent you from I?tikaaf and the I?tikaaf is not compulsory upon you, you should comply with their wishes.\n\n3. Silence is Makrooh if the silence is maintained as a form of Ibaadat as was prevalent in the past nations.\n\nAnd Allah Ta?ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
