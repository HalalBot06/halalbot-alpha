  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease provide a duaa for me so i can pray and convince my parents to let me marry the girl i want. there reasons for refusal are not fair. they say she is not closely related enough, she is too educated etc.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou request us to show you a du?aa to marry the girl you want and your parents are not happy with your choice. What if your parents make a similar request to us to show them a dua?a to convince you their way?\n\nDu?aa is indeed the essence of ibaadat and the weapon of a believer. However, Shari?ah has also advised us to consult before making important decisions. If your parents leave you to do as you want, what guarantee do you have that your choice is best for you. You do not have the experiences of life. You do not have the wisdom and maturity like your parents. Their advise to you is based on experiences of life and wisdom. More importantly, their advise is motivated by their love for you which you should consider strongly.\n\nNevertheless, we make du?aa to Allah to guide you to that which is best for you according to the absolute knowledge of Allah, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
