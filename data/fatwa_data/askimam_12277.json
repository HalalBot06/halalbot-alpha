  "question": "Regarding the question about the name ATHINA that was posted to you and your response.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs I understand the name ATHINA comes from the root word of THANNA which means praise and therefore the name ATHINA, which is derived from it, means praise also. Is this not correct?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is impossible for Atheenah to be derived from Thanaa, The root letters in thanaa are \"Thaa\", \"Noon\", \"Yaa\", while in Atheenah, the yaa is before the noon, thus it will be extra and not one of the orignal letters.\n\nIt is possible that Atheenah is a form of Aseenah (With a swaad, not seen). It is mentioned in Lisaanul Arab Vol.13 Pg.7, than the word Atheen is used to mean Aseen. As Aseenah would mean one of pure and noble birth, Atheenah could mean the same.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Husain Kadodia\nSTUDENT: Darul Ifta\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
