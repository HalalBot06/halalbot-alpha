  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamwalakum,\n\n \n\n \n\nMufti Saab my question is as follows. My parents recently bought a house. In order for it to be done in the Halal way they borrowed money from their children and other family members with their permission as opposed to the bank. This way it would not go under mortgage or interest and become a Haram transaction. My parent’s take Zakat out every single year in Ramadan however there is never an actual date, it just happens in Ramadan. The house was bought nearly 3 to 4 weeks before the beginning Ramadan. The money that was borrowed by my parents will be given back to all the parties that they have borrowed it from as it is accumulated.1) It is the time of Ramadan, so this year is the Zakat taken out on the amount that is remaining in the bank accounts as of today, or should it be taken out on the amount that existed before the house was bought. As well for the children and other family members, is the Zakat on the amount that sits in the bank right know, or should it be taken out on the amount that used to exist prior to the buying of the house. 2) As well beside money & gold what else is Zakat taken out on?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\n \n\n1)       The Zakat will be calculated according to the present financial situation. Furthermore, the loan taken from the children and family members will be a liability and non Zakatable. If the remaining amount in the bank is equivalent ao lesser than the liability, then Zakat does not have to be paid on the amount.\n\n \n\n2)       Refer to the table on Zakatable items elsewhere on this site.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
