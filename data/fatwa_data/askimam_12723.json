  "answer": "QUESTION\nplease advise. if i repent and ask Allah 2 4give me, will Nabi SAW still curse me? i did not do it 4 beauty purposes... they were really big. i wear hijab. shukran\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou should repent and ask Allah to forgive you. You should also stop plucking them. If your eyebrows continue growing to such an extent that they become double the size of a normal person?s eyebrows, then there could be permissible for you to trim them to a normal size, not smaller than that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
