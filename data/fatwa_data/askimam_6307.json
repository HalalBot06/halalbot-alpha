  "question": "I told my husband to take me to Islamabad because I cant live with his brother he is not mehram but he says that he canâ€™t afford",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy husband is working in Islamabad and he came on Friday night and than again goes on Monday morning and I have to spend the rest of the days with his mother and 18 years old brother in Peshawar. I have to sleep in the same room where his mother and brother sleep. Sometimes my mother-in-law goes out of the room even sometime she goes out of the house leaving him with me alone. I told my husband to take me to Islamabad because I cant live with his brother he is not mehram but he says that he can?t afford. He also allows me to visit my parents after 15 days but not to spend night. So I came to my parents home. I told him that if I can?t spend night with my parents I will also not spent night without you. I think he can afford me but according to him he says that I get married because I want my wife to live with my mother. She is a widow and he says that ?I can keep my wife the way I want and nobody has the right to talk in my personal affairs not even your parents?. Tell me that what is in Islam that if your husband don?t lives with u than where she lives with her family or with his family in the presence of his young brother and the step I have taken is right or am I doing sin living with my family without my husbands permission?Secondly in my haq-mehar there is both written hind-ul-thalab and moujal. Which will be accepted?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Considering your circumstances, it is rather difficult for you to live in\nyour mother-in-law's home. If your husband refuses to provide separate\naccommodation for you, you may live temporarily with your parents.\n2. It is his Islamic duty to provide separate accommodation for you even if\nit means a private room in the same house.\n3. Insha Allah, you will not be sinning by living with your parents in this\ncase.\n4. You question on the Mahr issue is unclear. Kindly rephrase and resubmit.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
