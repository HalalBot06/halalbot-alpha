  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta?ala says in the Qur?aan, ?Do people think that they will be left alone because they say, we believe, and will not be tested? And indeed, we tested those who were before them.? (Ankaboot Aayat2-3)\n\n?And seek help in patience and Salaat, and truly, it is extremely heavy and hard except for the true believers in Allah. Those who obey Allah with full submission, fear much from his punishment, and believe in His promise and in His warnings.?\n\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?He who makes Istighfaar regularly, Allah will fre him from sorrow and will solve him from the difficulties he faces and he will be given sustenance from such avenues that he didn?t even think of.? (Abu Dawud Hadith1506)\n\nIn view of the above, be patient and make abundant Istighfaar.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
