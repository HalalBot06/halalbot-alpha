  "answer": "QUESTION\nTasmiyah (Mentioning the Name of Allah: Is it fard or sunnah for zabeeha? What happens if the person does not recite the name of Allah: a) on purpose b) by mistake c) he is not aware d) under pressure?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nUpon slaughtering an animal, it is fard upon a Muslim to recite the name of Allah. If he did not recite the name of Allah intentionally, the meat of the animal will not be Halal. (Surah al-In'aam Aayat121)\n\nIf he forgot or was under pressure, he will be excused and the meat of such an animal will be Halal. Not being aware is not clear to us. (Ahsanul Fataawa vol.7 pg.403)\n\nAnd Allah Taala Knows Best.\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
