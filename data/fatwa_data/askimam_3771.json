  "question": "If attending the funeral of a non-Muslim is Haram, then what do you have to say about the following Hadith?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIt?s reported that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, stood with respect at a funeral procession, and upon being told that it was for a Jew, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, replied: ?Isn?t he a human being??(Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe incident was not at a funeral procession.\n\nIf it was at a funeral procession, then there was no need for such a\nquestion as it would be a known fact that it is a funeral of a Jew. In fact,\nit is far fetched to think that the Sahaabi (Radhiallaahu Anhu) who had a\ndoubt on the mere standing of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) upon\nseeing the Janaaza, would have been at the funeral.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
