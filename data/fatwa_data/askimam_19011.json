  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease can you inform me as to the correct method of cutting zulfa hair. Is it correct to just cut the hair at the bottom at the back? Or is it more correct to part the hair, let all the hair down and cut all around so the hair is all the same length around the sides and the back.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh  \n\n \n\nIt is Sunnah to grow a Zulfā. However, the Zulfā is divided into 3 catergories:\n\n1-       Wafrah- to cut the hair in line of the earlobes.\n\n2-      Limmah- to cut the hair between the earlobe and the shoulder.\n\n3-      Jummah- to cut the hair in line of the shoulders.\n\n(Ahsanul Fatāwā, Vol.8, Pg.79, HM Saeed)\n\nNote: It is impermissible for a male to grow his hair beyond his shoulders. If a person wishes to grow a Zulfā, he should also take care in grooming his hair and keeping it neat and tidy.\n\nIt is not a condition for every strand of hair to be equal, which is impossible once the hair is trimmed (from any side). However, the hair should not be cut in such a way that it resembles the Kuffār.\n\nThere is no specific way to cut the hair as long as it is cut correctly. Generally the Zulfā is trimmed at the back.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
