  "answer": "QUESTION\ncan you please tell me that when a women menses has ened and she wants to take ghusal what is the method for that. And when a women has intercourse and after that she wants to perform ghusal what is the method for that? What are the farz parts and what are the sunnats parts.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAfter menses or after intercourse, Ghusl becomes compulsory. There are three%0D%0AFardh in Ghusl, a) To gargle the mouth, b) To rinse the nose so that the%0D%0Awater touches the soft part of the bone in both the nostrils, and c) To make%0D%0Asure that the water reaches every strand of hair on the body, at least once.%0D%0AHowever, with regards to the woman's hair on her head, then there is%0D%0Adetails.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf she has plaited hair and the water comfortably reaches the roots of her%0D%0Ahair, then it is not necessary for her to undo her plaits. If her hair is%0D%0Athick and the water will not be able to reach the roots of her hair, then it%0D%0Ais compulsory for her to undo her plaits so that the water can reach the%0D%0Aroots. In any case, it is not necessary for the water to reach the inbetween%0D%0Ahairs of the plaits.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs for the Sunnats of Ghusl, then one should first wash both the hands upto%0D%0Athe wrists. Thereafter, wash all the impurities including the private parts,%0D%0Athe hair behind the knees, under arms and neck. Thereafter, one should make%0D%0Aa complete and perfect Wudhu and then throw water over the entire body three%0D%0Atimes.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
