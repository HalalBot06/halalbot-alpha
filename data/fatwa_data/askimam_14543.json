  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nKindly guide me that is it necessary to follow a Imam 100% whereas all four Imams have said that if you find anything contradicting with Quran & Sunah then leave it.  Similarly we find many Hadith in Sahih Bukhari regarding Rafa Yadain in prayer and reading Sura Fatiha behind Imam, theyn why we continue following Hanafi way of praying.  If you think this is the correct way, then what about prays offered in Makkah.  I want to ask cant we become just Muslim instead of Hanafi, Shafi, Maliki, Ahle-Hadith etc and follow Quran and Sahih Hadith.  Please guide in the light of Quran & Sunnah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nRasuallah sallallah alhi wa sallam was sent as a mercy for mankind. His life is an exemplary role model for us to abide by. As Muslims, we all are followers of his path.\n\nIn the books of Hadeeth, we find many different narrations regarding a single action of Rasuallah sallallah alhi wa sallam. Let us take the example of Rafa Yadain that you cited. Hazarat Ibn Umar Radiallah Anhu is the narrator of the Hadeeth. However, there are 6 different narrations related by him. In one narration he says that the hands should be raised twice. In another, thrice. In yet another, he says the hands should be raised four times during salath. The narration of Ibn Umar mentioned in Musnaad Humadee and Abu Awanath (2 books of Hadeeth) is that one should raise his hands only at the beginning of salath.\n\nThis is where the four Imam's play their role. They explain to us which Hadeeth has preference over the others. If we will not follow an imam, then we will end up following our base desires and begin to pick and choose from the treasure of ahadeeth.\n\n \n\nAll the imams as well as their followers are not only believers in Rasuallah sallallah alhi wa sallam but are his true followers. Through the four mazhabs, a vast majority of the Hadeethare being practiced upon. The purpose and goal of all is one and the same;to follow Allah and his Prophet sallallah alhi wa sallam. That is why you will not see enmity and hate between followers of different mazhabs. If in a certain region, hatred is being spread, then that is totally against the spirit of Islam and cannot be condoned.\n\n \n\nA far as the statement of the four imams that you mentioned, it is in fact true of all the A'immah-e-Mujtahideen. The Fuqaha have mentioned that these statements are addressed to those possessing qualifications equal to the task of determining which Daleel (legal proof) gets precedence over another. Leaving alone the common people, the scholars of these times do not possess the necessary qualifications for that daunting task.\n\n \n\nMost of these differences of opinion are minor. So if one were to pray behind an imam in the Haram, surely those salawaat will be in accordance to shariat. An article on the importance of taqleed can be found at the following web address.
