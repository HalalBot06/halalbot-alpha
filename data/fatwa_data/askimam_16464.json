  "question": "Can anyone do Tafseer of Quran themselves?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a question regarding  reading  the  Tafseer of the Holy Quran. Can you please tell us whether we can read the Tafseer of the Holy Quran as some of our brother read the Tafseer of the Holy quran after Faz'r salaat  or only an A'leem can give the Tafseer of the holy Quran.   \n\nMy second question is can i marry a girl without seeing her as i am  satisfied  with what my  parent  choses  for  me. and is it mandatory to see a girl for marriage.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1) If one has not studied Tafseer of the Holy Quran in-depth under the guidance of a proper 'Alim, then it will not be permissible to give one's own Tafseer to others. However, if one just reads the Tafseer of an 'Alim who studied the Quran in-depth, then not only will it be permissible, but rewarding as well InshaAllah as long as one has the intention to learn and benefit from the 'Alim's Tafseer.\n\n2) It is permissible to marry a girl without seeing her. However, it is a blessing from Allah Ta'ala that He has permitted us and given us the right to see a potential spouse before agreeing to the marriage. This is allowed so that one will feel satisfied before the marriage that he will be marrying someone who he feels attracted towards; otherwise if he is unsatisfied it may lead to problems in the marriage.\n\nIt is good to hear that you are satisfied with the choice of your parents. Parents are the ones who love their children the most and they will be able to pick someone who they feel is the best life-partner for their child. It is with this love and satisfaction you have with your parents that Allah Ta'ala will put blessings and barakah in your life and in your marriage. Although you feel satisfied, it is still advisable to do Salat-al-Istikhaarah as the best advice can only come from Allah Ta'ala.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
