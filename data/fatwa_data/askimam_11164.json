  "question": "Should I as a muslim help educate non muslims on a new system which their own kind refuses to help them?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Aleem I require an urgent reply to my question. Recently at work (where I am an Intern student), the company changed to a new system and I excel in this system because of my Tertiary education, I have offered help to my other collegues with no personal gain in mind. However I have been rudiculed by my fellow interns because they feel they when the permanant staff learn this system there will not be place for us at the company. I understand that I will be unemployed in 3months (if Allah wills)& I cannot do anything about it. What should I do with regards to educating these non muslims free of charge?? Will Allah and his Rasool be pleased with me????\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo help and assist one another is from good and noble character. It is also an act of virtue and charity.\n\nAs Muslims, we are encouraged to conduct ourselves with good character. This quality will be the most weightest on the scales on the day of Qiyaamat. Good character is also a means of attracting non-Muslims to Islam. It does not behove a Muslim not to assist one another due to the fear of some worldly loss. Allah Ta?ala is our Raaziq. He is the Sole Provider. The company and the new system is only a means. The company could close down tomorrow. The system too could change or fail.\n\nNever compromise in good character due to fear of being replaced. That is not the spirit of Imaan and Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
