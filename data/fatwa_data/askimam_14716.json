  "answer": "QUESTION\nsalam alaikum, i am a revert to Islam. is it allowed for me to attend funerals of my christian relatives ? in particular in the church?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram brother/sister in Islaam \n\n \n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\nIt is prohibited to attend the actual funeral ceremonies of non-Muslims. However, as Muslims, we should not loose sight of our Islamic morals, which strongly advise us to maintain good family relationships, even though our relatives may not be Muslims.\n\nTherefore, if a non Muslim relative passes away, one should take out some time and visit the family, console them, share their grief and display ones best character.Remember, displaying good character is one of the strongest ways of bringing them close to Islam.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’aala knows best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\nThe guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\nEducation and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\nIslam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\nWhen one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\nMuslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\nWe have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\nIf you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\nIf that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\nRasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit”. \n\n \n\n \n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
