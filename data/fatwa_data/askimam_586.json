  "question": "What was the age of Hazrat Ayesha Siddique(RAA) at the time of her marriage to Rasulullah(SAW)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome muslims who are appalled by the idea that she was as young as 9yrs old when the marriage was consumated, say she could not have been so young and that the Hadiths which say she was 9 are not reliable because they are transmitted by a narrator from Iraq and these narrators are not reliable and they cite evidence for their claims. See http://www.understanding-islam.com/ri/mi-004.htm\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPOLYGAMY%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala has given certain priviledges only to Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam) which are mentioned in Chapter 33 vs 50-51. Among other priviledges one was having more than four wives simultaneously. Allah Ta%C3%A3la says, 'Oh Nabi (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam) we have made permissible for you your wives.' (Ahzaab 33-50). The polygamous marriages of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam) to more than four wives simultaneously should be viewed as obeying the order of Allah Ta%C3%A3la to do so. It was not merely a means of fulfilling his carnal desires as many people allege. The Arab environment was infested with many evils among which was adultery and fornication. Despite living in such an environment, he never indulged in this evil act. His modesty was so popular among his people that when the Prophet (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam) claimed prophethood, his people made every effort to disgrace him by accusing him of being a poet, practising witchcraft, of being insane, etc. However, nobody ever accused him of any act of immodesty. The Prophet (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam) was very handsome and attractive. Many beautiful women from honourable families even proposed marriage to Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam) but he declined. Instead, when he was only 25 years of age he married a widow who had children from her previous marriage. Considering the fact that he was the most handsome person that Allah Ta%C3%A3la has created, many women desired him in marriage. Had he followed his desires, there was no obstacle for him to do so. In his youth, he could have had many many beautiful women, but he married a widow 15 years his senior. He lived with her for 25 years and she bore all the children of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam) except one. When Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam) was 50 years of age, Hadhrat Khadija (Radhiallaahu %C3%81nha) passed away. Those 25 years of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam)'s marriage was a monogamous one. The polygamous marriage was only after he attained the age of 50.%0D%0A%0D%0AAFTER 50 YEARS%0D%0AHe married Hadhrat Sawdah and %C3%81aisha (Radhiallaahu %C3%81nhuma). Sawda (Radhiallaahu %C3%81nha) lived with him immediately but %C3%81aisha (Radhiallaahu %C3%81nha) came to live with him in the year 2 AH. when he was approximately 54 years of age.%0D%0A%0D%0A55 YEARS (3 AH.)%0D%0AHe married Hadhrath Hafsa (Radhiallaahu %C3%81nha). After a few months, he married Hadhrat Zaynab bin Khuzaymah (Radhiallaahu %C3%81nha) who lived with him for only 3 or 18 months (as recorded in different narrations) before she passed away.%0D%0A%0D%0A56 YEARS (4 AH.)%0D%0AHe married Umme Salma (Radhiallaahu %C3%81nha)%0D%0A%0D%0A57 YEARS (5 AH.)%0D%0AHe married Zaynab (Radhiallaahu %C3%81nha)%0D%0A%0D%0A58 YEARS (6 AH)%0D%0AHe married Hadhrat Juwayriyah (Radhiallaahu %C3%81nha)%0D%0A%0D%0A59 YEARS (7 AH.)%0D%0AFirst he married Umme Habibah then Safiyyah then Maymoonah (Radhiallaahu %C3%81nhunna) in one year.%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the above explanation, it is clear that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam)'s marriage was a monogamous one till he was 50 years. His polygamous marriages, mostly to widows were after the age of 50 with the command of Allah Ta%C3%A3la. Had Nabi (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam) followed his carnal desires, he would have married all virgins and changed them in short periods of time. Since the polygamous marriages of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam) was by the order of Allah, therefore, the wisdom of that order cannot be questioned nor comprehended. However, according to our limited understanding, the wisdom underlying the polygamous marriages of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam) was:%0D%0A%0D%0ASince Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam) came as a teacher to mankind, there are many avenues of a person's domestic life which had to be conveyed to the Ummah. It was the many wives of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam) who had the knowledge of these aspects and fulfilled their responsibility by conveying the teachings of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam) to the Ummah. Consider the following: %0D%0A%0D%0A%C3%81aisha (Radhiallaahu %C3%81nha) alone narrated approximately 2210 Ahaadith with regard to different laws, character, ettiquettes, etc. The narrations of Hadhrat Umme Salma (Radhiallaahu %C3%81nhu) totals up to 378. Hafiz ibn Qayyim (RA) mentions that if the Fataawa of Hadhrat Umme Salma (RA) had to be gathered which she gave after the demise of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam), then the need would arise to compile an entire book. The total students of %C3%81aisha (Radhiallaahu %C3%81nha) are approximately 200 and she taught Deeni knowledge for 48 years consecutively after the demise of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam). %0D%0AThe mission of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam) was to convert people and propagate Islam. By marrying one woman, her entire tribe had accepted Islam. This was done by virtue of marrying that woman. %0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam) had to transform the evils of the society by practice. The people shunned marrying widows especially if they already had children from their previous husbands. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam) married a widow and thereby changed the wrong ideology of the people. Likewise, he reformed the society that abused the orphans by caring for the orphans of the women he married. %0D%0AThese are but just a few reasons behind the wisdom of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu %C3%81layhi Wasallam)'s polygamous marriages.%0D%0A%0D%0AJamiatul Ulama (KZN) - Fatwa Dept.%0D%0A"
