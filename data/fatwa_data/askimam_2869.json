  "question": "My question is with reference to an Ishtikhara. It is on behalf of a relative that I'm sending this to you.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nA blood relative of mine has been engaged for over a year. Because of continuing issues which keep arising either with themselves and/or the families, he decided to perform an Ishtikhara. The first night there was no dream. The 2nd. night he dreamt of a rattlesnake. The snake didn't bit or attack though the tail of the snake was vibrantly shaking and rattling(sound). He woke up frightened. He forgot to read it the 3rd. night so he started it all over again. The first night, no dream. The 2nd. night he dreamt of his Mom being taken away to the jail in a car while himself and relatives (siblings, Dad & cousins) were crying. No explanation in the dream as to why she was being taken away. He forgot to perform on the third night. He read the duas on the fourth night and had no dream. Insha-Allah you'll be able to provide your interpretation. Jazakallah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the purpose of the Istikhaara was to seek guidance in maintaining the\nengagement and proceeding with the Nikah, then according to the dreams, the\nindications are negative.\n\nWe advise that the person in reference also make Mashwara (consult) with his\nseniors and make an appropriate decision.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
