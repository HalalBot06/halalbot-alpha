  "question": "began wearing Hijab. My old friends have became outcasts because they have negative influence on me. However I cannot make my parents or cousins outcastes because they are always around me",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have began wearing Hijab about 6 months ago out sincerity to Allah (swt). My old friends have became outcasts because they have negative influence on me. However I cannot make my parents or cousins outcastes because they are always around me. My parents are not so religious (e.g they do pray but my\nmom doesn't practice the hijab etc.) I have lots of respect for them but my mother sometimes taunts me telling me that I look either ugly OR servant like, in the hijab. I usaully get tongue tied and feel pain in the heart. I don't mind how I look but the words from her mouth causes me emotional distress. My cousins also say things like I am a weirdo spending my youth in such a way by ingoring my caprice.Â  Please advise me\n1) What kind of answer can I give my mother when she tells me such things as mentioned above (with all due respect)?\n2) How can I make my iman stronger so her words wont make me dislike wearing Hijab or causing me distress. Any duwa's?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nConsider the following Hadith, 'Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'There will be seven types of people who will get the shadow of the throne of Allah when there won't be any other shadow. (This will be when the sun will be just above our heads). Among the seven types of people, one is 'a youth who reared himself/herself in the worship of Allah.' (Bukhari)\n\nTo wear a Hijaab for a female is Fardh. That sacrifice by a young female yields the reward as mentioned in the above quoted Hadith. When you are taunted, consider the choice between being, directly under the sun without shade on the day of judgment or the attitude of your mother and family, which of the two is more serious. At the same time, you should always speak about the fear of Allah Ta'ala and death to your family, that is done with Hikmat and sincerity, it will certainly have effect on them.\n\nSister, be steadfast.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
