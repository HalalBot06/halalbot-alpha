  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nFew Years back we recieved certain expensive gifts, jewellery from a non muslim whose main earning is through liqour business. The gifts also include food items, dry fruits, rice etc. Are the gifts haraam? The Darul uloom fatwa of deoband state that for a non muslim alcohol business is halaal, hence his earnings are hallal. if the gifts are haram , what should be done to the food items and the gifts, jewelley?  And we have also been eating the food items. So are our salaats accepted?\nAlso, may ALLAH bless you for ur effforts.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nWe concur with the fatwa of Darul Uloom Deoband.\n\nIf a non-Muslim gives a Muslim an item or a gift which is Islamically acceptable, the Muslim may accept it and use it. If the item or gift is not acceptable according to shariah, for example wine and liquor, a Muslim cannot accept such a gift.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
