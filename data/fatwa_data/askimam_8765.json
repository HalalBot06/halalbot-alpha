  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. I would like to know if it is permissible to sell coffins to underprivalged people that are non Muslims with the intention of providing it at cheap and reasonable prices? 2. If not, is it permssible to give a non-muslim a loan to start a business of selling cheaper coffins with no intention of making a profit? 3. Lastly, it is permissble to rent out a property to a non muslim that will use the premises as a mortuary?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. At the outset, we should remember that Muslims should not be buried in coffins and to do such will be against the Sunnah. However, if there is a need to use a coffin, then it will be permissible. In the light of the above, it will be permissible to sell coffins to non-Muslims although such transactions will not be free from some type of doubt and reprehensibility.\n\n2. Refer 1 above\n\n3. Yes, it is permissible\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
