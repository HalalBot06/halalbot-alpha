  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan a person play a board game wherein you have to roll a dice. Many people believe that it is impermissible to play with dice. Jazakallah for your time. May Allah reward you all for the good work you do\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe Quran has stated:\n\nThere are some people who purchase futile discourse to deviate from Allah’s path without knowledge, making a mockery of it (Allah’s path). There shall be a humiliating punishment for these people. (Surat Luqman:6)\n\nThe above interpretation of ‘futile discourse’ by Hazrat Hasan Basri (ra) is corroborated by a hadith in which Rasulullah (saw) said that every futile (pointless) act may be regarded as part of falsehood, except the following three seemingly playful acts:\n\nArchery\n\nTraining one’s horse\n\nPlayful behavior with one’s wife\n\nHazrat Abu Huraira (ra) reports that, upon seeing a person chase a pigeon (as a sport), Rasulullah (saw) commented, \"This is one Shaytaan running after another Shayaan.\" (Anwarul Bayaan vol. 7, pg. 31)\n\nRasulullah (saw) has mentioned that only sinners play chess and that it is a category of falsehood, which Allah detests. (Mishkaat pg. 387)\n\nThe Ahadeeth does not mention about ‘playing cards’ because it was not present at the time of Nabi (saw). It is haraam to play cards and board games if gambling is involved. If no gambling is involved it will be permitted only if it does not distract one from Allah’s remembrance, and it does not prevent one in fulfilling his/her Shar’ee duties, and does not have any elements which are against the Shariah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
