  "question": "In Quran, Verse 3 of Surah An-Nisa, it says do not marry orphens if you cannot do justice to them but marry 2, 3, and 4 women. Please explaine this.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn the same surah, I read that soldiers can have sexual relation with slave girl captured during the war without having married them. Am I right? Is it applicable today also? Why Islaam allows to have 4 wives? Although Islam says lays down the condition of equal justice to them, I could not understand the rationable for allowing 4 wives. My nonmuslim friends ask this question very frequently. Pleas explain.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The meaning of this verse is that if one fears that if he gets married to an orphan in his care, he will not give her, her due Mahr (dowry) and other rights, then he should get married to other Halaal women, even if they are two, three or four. However, if he fears not being able to do justice to them, then he should only marry one woman.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. It is permissible to have sexual relations with a slave girl (not a servant), who is classified as a slave according to the Shari?ah. This type of slavery is generally not found today. Therefore, not applicable.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Allah is our Creator and is the All-Wise. He knows us better trhan we know ourselves and He is aware of the benefits of allowing men to marry more than one wife. From the benefits of polygamy that are mentioned are:%0D%0A%0D%0Aa. The number of women in the world are much more than men, thus, if polygamy was not allowed, millions of women would not find spouses, as is apparent today. These women then have to earn for themselves and lead a lonely life. Many even resort to prostitution, to earn for themselves, and to fulfil the desires of men who need other wives but don?t take them because of society looking down on it. Polygamy leads to a stable, balanced society with strong morals as long as equality is practiced.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
