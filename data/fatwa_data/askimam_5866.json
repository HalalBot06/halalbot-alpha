  "question": "please can you tell me straight if oral sex is haraam or not?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nmy husbands says that a reliable mufti has told him that it is okay to have oral sex in his case,as he has a desire to have oral sex with his wife.however he he stipulates that if he does'nt get oral sex from his wife then this does not mean that he wants to or wishes to go out and get it.so everytime he wants it i have doubts,and he states that he has confirmed it with a reputable mufti.what is my position in all of this.i find it to be imitating the kaafir's and i find it to be filthy,but i do not mind if it is allowed,if not do i have the right to refuse this to him?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for one to put any impure substance into one's mouth.%0D%0ASince oral sex normally results in the impure discharges of the husband's%0D%0Aprivate part going into the wife's mouth, it is not permissible. On the%0D%0Acontrary, if the possibility of any impurity entering the mouth is%0D%0Aeradicated, then it will be permissible for the wife to caress the genitals%0D%0Aof her husband.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is recorded in the most famous authentic and frequently used book of%0D%0Ajurisprudence that, 'It is permissible for the husband to caress the entire%0D%0Abody of his wife with any portion of his body including his private part;%0D%0Alikewise, it is permissible for the wife to caress the entire body of the%0D%0Ahusband including his private part, with any portion of her body.' (Raddul%0D%0AMukhtaar vol.1 pg.292). Refer attached%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AOral sex between a husband and wife is considered as Makruh Tahrimi by the%0D%0Ajurists, since there is strong possibility that by ejaculation, Mazi (semen)%0D%0Acomes out and enters the mouth of the partner. There is consensus amongst%0D%0Athe Fuqahaa that Mazi is Najis (impure)%0D%0A%0D%0AORAL SEX%0D%0AMan has been created as a bearer of high and noble attributes. In him he%0D%0Amirros the attributes of divinity (Sifaat-e-Ilaahiyya) such as life,%0D%0Aknowledge, power, will, sight, hearing, speech, love, etc. In the%0D%0Aauthoritative Tafseer of the aforementioned Aayat, it is said that Insaan%0D%0A(man) has been adorned with the Noor of Aql (the light of intelligence).%0D%0AThis celestial faculty of intelligence creates in Insaan the capacity for%0D%0Athe manifestation of the lofty and divine attributes of Allah Ta%E3la. By%0D%0Avirtue of the Noor of Aql man becomes incandescent by being a mirror for%0D%0Athese lofty attributes and manifestation (Tajalliyaat-e-Zilliyah and%0D%0ASifaat-e-Zaatiyyah). As a direct consequence of this lofty pedestal which%0D%0AInsaan occupies in the Divine Scheme, the mantle of Khilaafah (vicegerency)%0D%0Ahas been conferred on him. Stating this fact, the Qur%E3n declares: 'Verily I%0D%0Ashall be creating on earth a Khaleefah.'%0D%0AIn the Tafseer of the Aayat mentioned at the beginning, it is also said that%0D%0Ain relation to all the species of life, man has been endowned with the most%0D%0Abeautiful form. All other animals have been created in a lowly form with%0D%0Atheir heads downwards. Their faces constantly pointing downwards to the%0D%0Aearth indicate their low rank in relation to man. In contrast, man has been%0D%0Acreated upright and he eats his food by means of raising it with his hands%0D%0Aunlike the lowly beasts with faces downwards.%0D%0A%0D%0AHIS DEBASEMENT%0D%0AIn the Tafseer of the Aayat, it is said that when man willingly destroys his%0D%0Anatural ability to progress to the pedestals of elevation, he degenerates%0D%0Aand falls from his lofty mansion. He then falls to levels lower than the%0D%0Alevel of dogs, pigs and even Shayaateen.%0D%0A%0D%0ASUPERIORITY%0D%0AAccording to the authentic Tafaseer, prior to the creation of Aadam (%C1layhis%0D%0Asalaam), the Malaaikah (angels) entertained the opinion that Allah Ta%E3la%0D%0Awill not create any being superior to them. Allah Ta%E3la negates this opinion%0D%0Aof the Malaaikah by creating Aadam (%C1layhis salaam) and making him a%0D%0Amanifestation of divine attributes. To illustrate Insaan's superiority over%0D%0Aall pecies of creation, Allah Ta%E3la commanded the Malaaikah to make Sajdah%0D%0A(prostration) to him (Nabi Aadam (%C1layhis salaam). The superiority of man is%0D%0Awell emphasised by the statement of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam): 'Allah created Aadam in His (Allah's) form.' Insha Allah, this%0D%0AHadith will be explained in greater detail in some future issue of 'the%0D%0AMajlis'. Here it is sufficient to mention the interpretation of the%0D%0Aauthorities intelligence, sight, hearing, etc. These lofty attributes are%0D%0Alocated in that part of the human body called head. It is for this reason%0D%0Athat Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) forbade striking or slapping%0D%0Athe face of any human being or even an animal. In the Tafseer of the Qur%E3nic%0D%0AAayat which permits husbands to beat wives in cases of necessity, it is%0D%0Asaid: 'The face shall not be slapped'. Explaining the reason for the%0D%0Aprohibition of slapping the face, Imaam Nawawi (RA) says in his Sharhul%0D%0AMuslim, 'Because the face is the embodiment of man's beauty in addition to%0D%0Ait being of sublime nature.'%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE LATAA-IF-E-SITTAH%0D%0AIn man there are six metaphysical or non-material or spiritual faculties%0D%0Aknown as the Lataa-if-e-sittah. Two of these lofty faculties, viz. Lateefah%0D%0AKhaafi and Lateefah Akhfa are located in the head. The Lateefah Akhfah is%0D%0Alocated in the centre of the brain while the location of Lateefah Khafi is%0D%0Abetween the eyebrows. The functions of these faculties are the highest%0D%0Astates of reflection and contemplation, progressing from the high state of%0D%0AFana to Fanul Fana. These are spiritual or Roohani stages which shall not be%0D%0Adiscussed in this article.%0D%0A%0D%0APATHWAY FOR QUR%C3N%0D%0AIn the Ahaadith, the following narration appears.%0D%0A'Verily, your mouths are pathways of the Qur%E3n, therefore purify your mouths%0D%0Awith Miswaak'.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Makhaarij or places from whence Qur%E3nic huroof (letters) emanate are%0D%0Alocated in the mouth. The high Ibaadat of Tilaawat of the Qur%E3n shareef is%0D%0Aeffected via the mouth, hence the Hadith describes the mouth as the 'pathway%0D%0Aof the Qur%E3n'. Since it is, literally speaking, the channel for the%0D%0Arecitation of the Qur%E3n shareef, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)%0D%0Aemphasised much the maintainance of its purity. The emphasis on the purity%0D%0Aof the mouth could be gauged from the many times Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam) would use the Miswaak everyday to clean his mouth. The%0D%0Apractice of Miswaak is strongly stressed by the Shari%E1h. In one Hadith,%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'When the servant of Allah%0D%0Auses the Miswaak and then performs Salaat, an angel stands behind him,%0D%0Alistening attentively to the recitation of the Qur%E3n. The angels draws%0D%0Acloser and closer to the reciter and places his mouth on the mouth of the%0D%0Areciter. Thus every word emanating from the mouth of the Musalli enters the%0D%0Aangel's mouth. Therefore, maintain your mouth pure and clean for the Qur%E3n.%0D%0A%0D%0AZIKRULLAH%0D%0AThe actual purpose underlying the creation of man is Zikrullah or the%0D%0Aremembrance of Allah Ta%E3la. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) ordered%0D%0AMuslims to maintain their tongues fresh with the Zikr of Allah Ta%E3la.%0D%0AThe facts mentioned above will indicate that Insaan is Ashraful Makhlukaat%0D%0A(the noblest of creation) and the noblest part of his body is his head which%0D%0Ais the location for lofty faculties and attributes which earn for him the%0D%0Adesignation of 'the form of Allah'. In order that he maintains his lofty%0D%0Arank and progresses continuously towards loftier mansions and closer Divine%0D%0AProximity, it is essential that man exercises restraint over his physical%0D%0Aand animal qualities. If he fails in this respect, he will descend to a%0D%0Alevel below the lowly beasts. Allah Ta%E3la has endowed man with intelligence,%0D%0Awill-power and shame. He must employ these attributes to subdue his animal%0D%0Aand carnal desires and refrain from indulgence in the excesses of lust. If%0D%0Ahe fails in this achievement he will annihilate himself spiritually and%0D%0Adegenerate to sub-animal levels.%0D%0AThe sublimity of Islam is of such a lofty degree that it exhorts its%0D%0Aadherence to adopt dignity, deportment and propriety in even sexual%0D%0Arelationship. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) advised his Ummah to%0D%0Aabstain from total nudity when indulging in sex and not to behave 'like%0D%0Aasses'. Since Islam is a culture of transcendental values calculated to%0D%0Aensure maximum remembrance of Allah Ta%E3la, a Muslim should not debase%0D%0Ahimself to a sub-animal level by resorting to the vile practice of oral sex.%0D%0AThe mouth of Insaan is the pathway of the Qur%E3n, his tongue has been%0D%0Acommanded to remain fresh with Zikrullah; his mouth is situated in the%0D%0Anoblest part of his body; the functions of his mouth are noble and lofty;%0D%0Ahis mouth is a passageway for transference of the recited Qur%E3n into the%0D%0Amouth of the listening angel. He cannot, therefore, debase and dishonour%0D%0Ahimself so disgracefully by resorting to the revolting practice of oral sex.%0D%0AA Muslim should not dishonour that head and face which the Shari%E1h of Islam%0D%0Acommands to be honoured. Allah Ta%E3la honoured the human head with noble%0D%0Aqualities, the highest being the Noor of Aql, but man debases that lofty%0D%0Apart of his body by indulging in an act of bestiality not even committed by%0D%0Athe lowly beasts. It does not behove man in general, and a Muslim in%0D%0Aparticular to degrade himself in this manner.%0D%0AThe Mu'min's link with Allah Ta%E3la is so strong or ought to be so strong%0D%0Athat the Shari%E1h has prescribed a particular Du%E1 to be recited even when a%0D%0Aman approaches his wife for sexual relations. Even at the moment of reaching%0D%0Aclimax and ejaculation, the Muslim is required to read in his mind (without%0D%0Amoving the lips) a special Du%E1 so that he remains protected from any%0D%0AShaitaani interference. We learn from the Hadith of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam) that Shaytaan attempts to interfere with man even while he%0D%0Aindulges in lawful sex, hence the wording of the special Du%E1 for this%0D%0Aoccasion is: 'O Allah! Protect us from Shaytaan and protect the offspring%0D%0Ayou grant us from Shaytaan'.%0D%0AAllah Ta%E3la has honoured man highly, hence the Qur%E3n says, 'Verily, we have%0D%0Ahonoured the sons of Aadam.' He is therefore not allowed to debase himself%0D%0Awith the bestial acts which even the lowly beasts do not commit.%0D%0AThe mouth is an honoured part of the physical body. It is not a receptacle%0D%0Aof impurity. The Shari%E1h emphasises the maintainance of its purity. Even in%0D%0Athe developing foetus, Allah Ta%E3la has arranged for the maintainance of the%0D%0Apurity of the mouth. The umbilical cord connects the developing embryo to%0D%0Aits mother. It is the passageway in which exchange of nutrient and waste%0D%0Amaterials with the circulatory system of the mother takes place. In man the%0D%0Aumbilical cord arises at the navel below which is the location of the%0D%0Arebellious Nafs which reduces man to sub-animal levels if not restrained.%0D%0AWhy does Allah Ta%E3la not create the foetus with the umbilical cord attached%0D%0Ato its mouth so that its nutrition reaches it in the normal way, viz. Via%0D%0Athe mouth? Right until the very last moments prior to its emergence into the%0D%0Aexternal world, the baby's nutrition is via the umblical cord. Immediately%0D%0Aon reaching the outside world its nourishment reaches it from the mouth.%0D%0ASince the umbilical cord is also the passageway for impure waste matter, its%0D%0Aconnection is near to the location of the lowly nafs. The mouth has thus%0D%0Abeen guarded against impurities.%0D%0AThe facts presented in this article should be sufficient to convey to%0D%0AMuslims that their Imaan and the spirit of the teachings of Islam do not%0D%0Apermit them to grovel in the dregs of debasement and perpetrate moral%0D%0Ainjustice by utilising the mouth for deriving sexual pleasure. This is not%0D%0Athe function of the mouth. It is a misappropriation of an amaanat (trust).%0D%0AAll parts of the body are Amaanat which have to be utilised in accordance%0D%0Awith the instructions of Allah Ta%E3la. Such contamination and moral pollution%0D%0Aas entailed by oral sex are most unbecoming the dignity and rank of man,%0D%0Aespecially if the Insaan appears to be a follower of the illustrious Shari%E1h%0D%0Aof Muhammad (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam). Allah Ta%E3la states in the Noble%0D%0AQur%E3n, 'Verily, Allah loves those who purify themselves.'%0D%0A%0D%0AExtracted from 'The Majlis' Vol. 6 No. 8%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta%E3la Knows Best.%0D%0A%0D%0AWas salaam%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
