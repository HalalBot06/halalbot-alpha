  "question": "Did any other Ummat have Salaat? If yes, how many times a day? And what Ummats?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt has been narrated that Salaat has been established in the Shari'ah of the\nProphets preceding as it was at Fajr time when Hadhrat Aadam (AS)'s\nrepentance was accepted by Allah, so he performed two Rakaats Salaat.\n\nHadhrat Ibraahim (Alayhis salaam) performed 4 Rakaats at the time of Dhuhr\nwhen he saw the lamb being replaced in lieu of his son. It was the Asr time\nwhen Hadhrat Uzayr (Alayhis salaam) was brought to life once again inlieu of\nwhich he performed 4 Rakaats of Salaat. At the time of Maghrib, Hadhrat\nDaawud (Alayhis salaam)'s repentance was accepted after which he performed 3\nRakaats and Esha Salaat has been given to this Ummat as a gift.
