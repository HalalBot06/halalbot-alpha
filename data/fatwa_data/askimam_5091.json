  "question": "Please help me understand my dreams.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalamu alakum. About 8 months ago I dreamt I was walking across my lawn behind my dad. We were headed to the house next door while crossing the grass I bumped into a guy who was going the same way. We looked at each other and smiled I never felt love like that I felt so peaceful we walked away. My dad & I went into the house to look around. I bumped into the guy again except this time we were looking at my dad and what I felt was his brother talking. It seemed like they didn?t agree on what they were talking about. I told this dream to a girl and she said that it means I will meet someone & we?d fall in love but it won?t work out between us unless I have another dream about the guy. A week later I met this guy. I have never seen him before in my life. He lives with his brother because his parents passed away I knew that in my dream. About 1 month after I met him I dreamt I walked into a restaurant with my parents. I told them to sit down until I come back. I went to the kitchen where the guy was. We sat with friends. Then he was cooking and his legs caught on fire. Before the ambulance took him I told him I loved him and then headed back to where my parents were sitting. Instead of walking into the restaurant I walked into a room full of women. It felt like it was my wedding but it didn?t seem like it I wasn?t wearing a white dress. I told this dream to a girl she said that the legs catching on fire mean he?s getting married. Plz. explain these dreams. Gazak Allah kair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dreams have no significance.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
