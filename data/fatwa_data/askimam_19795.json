  "question": "Would a person(who does a good deed without knowing its virtues) get less reward than those who not only does the good deed but also knows its virtues?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy question is regarding the ihtisaab(knowing the virtue of doing good deed). Would a person(who does a good deed without knowing its virtues) get less reward than those who not only does the good deed but also knows its virtues. For example, a person might pray 5 times salat as an order of Allah S.W.T but not necessarily know the virtues of praying 5 times will get less reward than a person who prays 5 times and knows about its virtues. Is it correct to say that the virtues(Fazail) are only for the motivation purposes? jazakallah khair!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu `alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh\n\n\nIn principle a person is rewarded according to his level of sincerity (ikhlass) and devotion in performance of a deed. That reward is best known by Allah Suhana WaTa’ala. However, if a person knows the reward of doing certain deed, that knowledge would further motivates him in doing the deed with more sincerity and thereby increase his reward.
