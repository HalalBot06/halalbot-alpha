  "question": "I am disabled and it is beneficial and convenient for me to sleep on my stomach. Is it still makrooh or haram? Do I have to wash my feet during wudu?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaams I recently got into an accident which has resulted in me being a paraplegic, i.e. I cannot use my leg muscles, more specifically I cannot feel my muscles from my chest down. When I have to sleep, I can sleep on my either sides and on my back but I have to change my position every two hours because I can develop an open pressure sore. My bones push down against my skin and stop the blood flow which results in the bones pushing out of my skin. When I sleep on the side I can develop sores on my heels, my knees and my hips? but if I lie down on my stomach and put pillows underneath me I can sleep for virtually as long as I want. Would it still be considered makrooh or haram? in addition, I cannot control my urine so if I urinate between the times I empty my bladder should I do ghusl everytime? 3) I am on a wheelchair therefore I don?t put my feet on the ground. Do I still have to wash my feet during wudu because It is difficult for me to do so?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt will not be Makrooh if you sleep on your stomach when you are in this state. You will still have to wash your feet because that is a farz act in wudhu. If you find it difficult it is advisable that you take assistance or else if it is easier than you should put your feet in a bowl of water.\n\nIf you cannot control your urine then it is advisable if a diaper is worn. Whatever part the urine touches, wash, perform istinja and make ablution. To make ghusl will not be necessary.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
