  "question": "reciting the 99 names of Allah. For instance, reciting \"Al-Azizu\" 40 times after each fajr prayer will make the person independant of needs from others. Are these true?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1: Many websites have articles that attach virtues of reciting the 99 names of Allah. For instance, reciting \"Al-Azizu\" 40 times after each fajr prayer will make the person independant of needs from others. Are these true? 2: If I do a perfect Hajj for a dead person, will all his sins be forgiven? ie. will he have no sins on the Day of Judgement? 3: How much time does one get before they cannot read the Fajr and Maghrib prayers? Are there restrictions on other prayers? 4: I heard if you pray 40 consecutive farz prayers in the Prophet's Mosque, you are half-way to heaven. Is this true? Last thing, can you consider making a glossary for your website? When I read some of your answers, I often get stuck on some words. Thank you for your time.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. These virtues are proven from the experience of the pious and there is hope that the recitation of these names will grant these benefits, however it is not definite.\n\n2. The reward for the Haj will go to him, inshallah and we have hope that Allah will use this to wipe off his sins.\n\n3. The Fajr prayer must be said before sunrise, the Zohr prayer before the time of Asr enters, the Asr prayer before sunset, the Maghrib prayer before Esha enters and Esha before dawn.\n\n4.Nabi (saw) has mentioned that the person who performs 40 consecutive prayers in his Masjid, will get 2 certificates: one for freedom from hypocrisy and one for freedom from the fire of Jahannum. (Musnad Ahmed)\n\n5.Jazakallah for the good suggestion, we will bear it in mind.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
