  "question": "Her husband wants her to wear Niqab and shape her eyebrows",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssaamualaykum, i have a friend both she n her husband r religious. Their daughter is in full purdah but he doesnt allow his wife 2 wear nikaab n her eyebrow she has to shape them. If a man does that, hav heard people say the sins go 2 the husband for making  her eyebrow n not wearing nikaab? I kno every1 carries his/her own amaal but does the sin really go tn the man!\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf the wife does not want to shape her eyebrows and she does that out of pressure from her husband, then the husband will be responsible for that sin.\n\nSimilarly, if the wife wants to wear niqaab and the husband stops her from that, then in this case too, he will be sinful.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
