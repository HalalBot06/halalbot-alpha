  "question": "Can I invite my close friends and family and do a Khatame-Quraan or Yaseen or Ayat-e-Kareema to invoke Allah?s blessings and Rahmat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAre there any conditions attached? Can this be done to provide Sawaab to the Ruh(Soul) of a deceased person?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou should avoid doing so. These friends will not be reciting for the pleasure of Allah Ta'ala, but just to please you. What benefit or thawaab can then be expected?\n\nOne may simply request them to do good actions and make the intention that the deceased also receives the reward. In this way, there will be sincerity in what little they do.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
