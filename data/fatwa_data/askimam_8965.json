  "answer": "QUESTION\nis it sin to get married without the knowledge of parents ... in case is they are not agreed upon coz of community problem\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNikah is a personal and individual right whereby every sane adult is permitted to make his or her own decision as far as choosing the marriage partner is concerned.\n\nAn adult does not require the consent of his or her parents for the Nikah. Yes, if a woman marries in a lower class, her guardian reserves the right to terminate the Nikah. However, it is best to inform the parents and get their Du?aas for a successful and blissful marriage.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
