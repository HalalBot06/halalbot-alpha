  "question": "Assalamoalaikum Respected Mufti Sahab! Very recently I was discussing with my friends that what flexibility does Islam offers in fulfilling Allahâ€™s orders.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIt was believed that Islam offers very strict rules, which nowadays are impossible or at least very difficult to follow. I have heard from speeches of ulemas and in books that quoted a hadith that said that Allah swt will forgive all sins except for zina and loanFrom another hadith it was quoted that, all sins will be forgiven except for shirk and kufr. Another stated that taking snaps would not be forgiven. Furthermore, another stated that if somebody misses a solat purposely, then this sin will not be forgiven. Once again, we came across a very alarming hadith which stated 7 sins which most of the muslims are engaged in committing nowadays will not be forgiven. Those are: 1. shaving off beards 2. covering ankles 3. women refraining from parda 4. people who sing, listen, participate in making songs 5. people who develop, take, any kind of living pictures(snaps). 6. riba 7. backbiting. The hadith which was quoted for these above 7 acts was Kullu ummat-e- maafi illa mujahirooni.e. Those who do sins openly will not be forgiven. So all of these are the sins which most of us perform. Secondly, why are these hadiths contradicting. Does it means that all of these wont be forgiven, or there is any one of these narrations which should be considered the most important one? In addition, I have heard that wearing a beard is farz bilIjmaeummah. But why is it said to be sunnah? Prophet said, that on the day of judgement, he wont meet(regard) people as Muslims who are without beards.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala is definitely Most Merciful. However, the non believers will\nnever be forgiven. Allah Ta'ala mentions in the noble Qur'aan, 'Verily Allah\nwill never forgive those who ascribe partners with him.' (An-Nisaa 48). If a\nnon-believer does not good actions, e.g. helping orphans, feeding the poor,\netc. According to scholars of Deen, they say Allah gives His recompense in\nthis world. However, in the hereafter, there is no share for him.\n\nIn order for a person to enter officially in the sacred religion, he has to\ntestify with his tongue. Just merely attracted to Islam does not render him\na Muslim. The uncle of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), Abu talib,\nknew the truth of this religion and was attracted to it. But he still died\nas a Kaafir (non-believer), hence, will be punished.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
