She already has kids and finding difficulty to look after them. Her husband does not have any objection as he is also consern about her health.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, it is not permissible for a female to undergo a permanent\nsterilization.\n\nShe may adopt any temporary birth control method suitable to her. If\nadopting a temporary birth control method does not relieve her medical\ncomplications and sterilization is the only solution, then she will be\nexcused.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
