  "question": "Maghreb salat can be prayed up to 45 minutes after its azan as after that isha starts(in summers and winter both)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRegarding the time of Maghreb salat,a mufti sahib told me that Maghreb salat can be prayed up to 45 minutes after its azan as after that isha starts(in summers and winter both).I reside in pakistan.\n\n\n\nI used to say isha salat after 45 min as told by the mufti sahib.\n\nAfter many years i kind of doubted and waswassas began to appear that whether my salat was valid or not. I asked another mufti sahib that you should not say isha before azan but if you have been saying isha after 45 min ,after Maghreb time you do not have to worry,your prayer is valid.\n\nNow i am asking you and i feel that i will not get satisfied until you tell me  that whether my isha at the above mentioned time was valid or i have to repeat them ,as i didnot know and was guided by someone else.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe time for Maghrib Salaat ends with the disappearance of the whiteness on the horizon and this coincides with the commencement of the time for Esha. (Tabyeen vol.1 pg.219; Ilmiyah).\n\nThe time varies from country to country according to the geographical location. In Pakistan itself, the time varies with the changing of citires. We advise that you contact a reputable Ulama board in Pakistan or in your city to provide you with this information. Furthermore, we advise that you perform your Salaat with Jamaat or delay your Esha Salaat until such a time that no doubt remains.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
