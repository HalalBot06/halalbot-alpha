  "question": "Taking of oneâ€™s Rizk by Whichcraft or black magic",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have been told by my adults that ALLAH has written the rizk(earning) that one would achieve in his/her life. ALLAH wants us not to stay idle in our house based on this belief but to go and seek for it, but ALLAH has written whatever you would get in your life whatsoever. My question is regarding whichcraft. I have been told by somebody that despite of my great education and academic success, I am suffering from a hard time to get a proper job because I have been whichcrafted by jeolousy. I want to know the pure islamic way of getting rid of this whichcraft. Also, is it possible that whichcraft done for rizk and success in life, can jeoperdize and take away the rizk that ALLAH has already written in one's destiny. Please clarify me on this as I m really worried nowadays. JazakALLAH\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJust as your Rizq (sustenance) is predestined for you, so is the calamity you are suffering from predestined for you.\n\nNot finding a proper job does not necessarily mean that you are under a spell of black magic. On what grounds have you come to this conclusion? Have you consulted an expert in this field? Recite Aayaatul Kursi after every Fardh Salaat and before retiring to bed at night recite the last three Quls and blow over the palms and rub over the entire body thrice. This will, Insha Allah, protect you from black magic.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
