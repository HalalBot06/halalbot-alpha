  "question": "Imam says i should give my Zakaat here in USA but my family says i should send to Pakistan",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI read your Fatwa #  13532. it appears that you can send your Zakat to your home coutry while living outisde of it. Now here is my question. I live in USA and Imam of our masjid told me that I can  not send Zakat to home country if there are poor needy people here in USA, specially in our own community. On the other hand my family back in Pakistan is insisting me to send zakat money to poor and needy people of Pakistan, specially in our locality in Pakistan. I am confused now, where to spend zakat money. Secondly I dont know needy people personally here in USA but I totally believe in my Imam Masjid. Our Imam masjid has a Zakat committe who verifies about poor and needy people here in USA. Please guide me what I am suppose to do in this situation.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is permissible to send your Zakaat over to espically if your own relatives are deserving of Zakaat. If your relatives are not deserving of Zakaat,then too you may send your Zakaat to if there is a greater need there for the funds.
