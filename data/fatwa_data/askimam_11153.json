  "question": "In Tariqat, is it obligatory to ask your sheikh for any undertaking (eg. to go for Hadj / job change) and do you have to abide by his decision. Explain also the reason for this please.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe purpose of having a Shaykh in Tareeqat is for guidance and most importantly to attain spiritual upliftment. It is obvious that a responsible person will choose an appropriate person as his guide.\n\nIf a person requires the guidance of his Shaykh, he should consult him and follow his guidance. If he does not consult his Shaykh, or do not follow his guidance, he will not be sinful. However, his attitude will be defeating the purpose of Bay?at ? guidance and spiritual upliftment.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
