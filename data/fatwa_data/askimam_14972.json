  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhen making istikhara do you have to a few days in a row or until you see a dream, what if you see a dream that's good one day and bad the other?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAmong the many difficulties that man undergoes is “confusion” and “perplexity”. Almost everyday in his life man is faced with the task of making decision between two or more choices. Generally the decisions are not quite major, but sometimes they do become quite serious. Even in these circumstances our beloved Prophet (saw) taught us what to do and clearly outlined the solution by performing Istikhara.  It is neither a condition that when doing Istikhara that a dream should be seen nor any feelings must be felt in the heart. If a person is still confused after the first day then one should do Istikhara the next day and continue the Istikhara.  After making Istikhara, if one is sill undecided then one should make mashura with people in whom one has confidence\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
