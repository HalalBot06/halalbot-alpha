  "answer": "QUESTION\nPermissibility of Looking at other than the Face and Hands The document is taken from as-Saheehah of Shaykh Al-Albaani Volume 1/201-209 Trans: Hassan Somali. It is related from Abu Humayd (radiyallaahu 'anhu ? who saw the Prophet) that the Messenger of Allah (sallaallahu alayhi was sallam) said: ?When one of you proposes to a woman, there is no harm to look at her, even if you were to look at the one proposed to and she did not know.? (Reported in Ahmad (5/424) and at-Tahaawee (3/14) ) 1.If it comes to a mans heart that he wants to propose to a lady, then it is ok for him to look at her.?Saheehah Shaykh Al-Albaani: 1/201 On the authority of Sahl ibn Ali Hatmah that he said: I saw Muhammad ibn Muslimah following (strongly with his eyesight) Batheenah bin Adh-dahaak, he was on top of her roof, I said to him: ?Are you doing this and you are from the companions of the Messenger of Allah?? He replied: ?Verily I heard the Messenger of Allah say?? ? he quoted the above hadeeth. 2. If one of you was to propose to a lady (woman), then if he is able to look at that which would call him to marry her, then he should do so.? Saheehah Al-Albaani: 1/204 Jaabir ibn Abdullah said: ?I proposed to a slave girl, so I used to hide from her, until I saw that which called me to (wed) marry her.? So it is permissible to glance/look at more than the face and the hands, due to the generality of the ahadeeth that have preceded due to his Saying:- 2.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible to look at a woman for purposes of marriage. According to Shari?ah, this falls in the category of Dhuroorat and need. In principle, a need should be confined to its necessity. The purpose of looking at a woman for marriage is to consider her beauty, shape and texture of her skin. That is fulfilled by looking at her face (beauty), hands (texture). Her shape is also gauged.\n\nThat is sufficient for a person to decide. It is not appropriate to issue a general permission as there are many negative factors in it. What if the person did not propose after seeing the body of the woman? What if somebody just wants to see the girl in the pretext of marriage? It is important to apply the principle, ?Saddan lil baal? to avoid abuse of the situation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
