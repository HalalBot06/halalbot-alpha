  "question": "Can we eat in a restaurant with mixed gathering?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) can wife kiss the private parts of the husband and can the husdand kiss the private parts of the wife.\n2) can wife suck the private part of the husdand while the husband is wearing flavoured condems or any regular condem.\n3) is it permissable to eat in a restaurant where there is mixed gathering without music if the wife is doing full sharie purdah. i saw ulema doing this while i was on haj. before going to haj i asked in a local dar ul ifta and they said it is not permissable. i am confused. please help and eloborate on this issue of eating in restaurants.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1&2)  It is against shame and modesty to do so.\n\n3)       If the restaurant caters for Hijaab facilities and there is no mixing with men and women cordoned off Hijaab area, it will be permissible to eat at the restaurant. However, it is better if the food is bought and eaten at home or in the hotel room. It is important that you do not judge the actions of others. They are responsible for their actions. We are not bound to interfere in their personal lives. It is possible that these Ulama were using the Hijaab facilities. To harbour unfounded doubts and suspicion is a major sin.\n\nAnd Allah knows best \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
