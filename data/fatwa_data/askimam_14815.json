  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nreferring to your fatwa number 8214, I would like to know if someone down the line buys a product which is unislamic or Haraam , without my knowledge or with my knowledge, does my commission which I receive considered to be Haraam or Halall?\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are two issues in your query.\n\n \n\nSin for referrals.\nCommission.\n\nIf you referred the customer to the store and he on his own purchased an un-Islamic item, you will not be sinful for that. However, you cannot collect the specific commission for the sale of the un-islamic item.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
