  "question": "Can you store pictures on computers?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n.The fact that the image is not actually physically there, it may be permissble. It is stored in bits and bytes, if you are familiar with these terms. So can Angels still enter our house?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe images appearing on computers are not pictures in the strict sense as envisaged in the Ahadith of the Holy Prophet, Sall-Allahu alayhi wa sallam, unless they are printed in a durable form on paper or on any other object.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
