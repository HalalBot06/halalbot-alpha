  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease could you tell the whole story of Qual urain (Sekander Bukt). Jazzakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu There were a number of famous historical personalities by the name of Alexander (Sikander). The one generally referred to as 'Alexander the Great' was a Greek commander who was also the student of the famous greek philosopher Aristotle. This much is known in history that this particular 'Alexander the Great' was a Mushrik (polytheist). From the Qur'aan, it is established that Dhul-Qarnayn was a pious Muslim, and according to some, was a Nabiy as well. Thus, Dhul Qarnayn was definitely not 'Alexander the Great'. According to the Mufassir ibn Kathir, Dhul Qarnayn was another Alexander (Sikander) in Arabic, who appeared some 2000 years before 'Alexander the Great' (Ma'ariful Qur'aan vol.5 pg.618) We are not aware of 'Sikander Bukt'. and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai FATWA DEPT."
