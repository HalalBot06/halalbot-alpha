  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow can remedy the following problems: I frequently feel tired lacking in energy , I repeat actions several times eg before sleeping I will check the same light is switched off 3 times, I keep washing my hands, I am repetitive in washing so that a shower takes me 20 mins when others do it in 5 mins. I am quite slow in general actions eg performing wudu takes at least 4 mins when rushing, but typically takes 5 mins. I find all this quite frustrating and sometimes feel unhappy when I think of the time I waste eg when I decide to go to bed I repeatedly check all the doors are locked, windows are shut, cooker and lights are off, but this usually takes 45 mins so I go to sleep too late and feel I do not get enough sleep. I find that there is not enough time in the day. Furthermore I work in a Consultancy firm and my work involves a lot of numerical work, I find I repeatedly check my work and so take longer to do my work. This is a problem as my work is charged to clients on an hourly basis and thus what I achieve in what time is sometimes scrutinised. Also during prayer uncertainty as whether I have prayed correctly appears in my mind and I feel the urge to repeat my prayers or feel unsure whether to repeat my prayers and if I do, I get frustrated. I am nearly 23 years old and feel I should be more energetic and less repetitive.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlhumdulliah we highly commend you on taking the step to seek help and address your concerns.
