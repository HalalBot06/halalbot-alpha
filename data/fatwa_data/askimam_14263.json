  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWell it's like this, my dads friend married her daughter away to a non muslim, who at the time of marriage accepted Islam, and said he was muslim. But now when the girl is awaiting her child, the man now say that he does not believe in any religion but that he believes in God.  To me this looks like, the person is not a muslim((He isn't) but my question is: Can they still live together  , or not?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf the person accepted Islam before marriage, the marriage was valid. If he now claims that he does not believe in any religion, he is a Murtad (renegade). His marriage is invalidated and the boy and girl cannot live together as husband and wife.\n\nThe person should make Tawbah and sincerely return to Islam. He will then have to reperform his Nikah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
