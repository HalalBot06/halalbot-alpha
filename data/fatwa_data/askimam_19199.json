  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamo Alaykum. i completed my hifz at the age of 14 but i have been living in ghaflat since and forgot the hifz of the Holy Qur'aan. AstaghfirUllah. i have sincerely repented to Allah and hav started praying my 5 times salat and have Insha'Allah made a firm intention to memorise the Holy Qur'aan again. although i am only learning a few ayats a day i feel it will get easier Insa'Allah. is it true that a person who has forgot but then makes intention and starts to learn again but dies only after memorising a little he will die as a complete Hafiz because he had the firm intention? Please Mufti saheb pray for me and my family and friends. May Allah reward you for the excellent work you are doing in helping people like me. Jazak Allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nIt is very encouraging to know that you have realized the seriousness of forgetting the Quran and you have repented and making an effort to memorize the Quran again.\n\nYour sincerety and effort in memorizing the Quran is a sign of your tauba being accepted.\n\nWe make dua that Allah grant you steadfastness in your effort of memorizing the Quran again, Ameen.\n\nYour are memorizing a few lines daily. Over a period of time that will become easier and you will memorize more verses. If you spend more time, it will be better InshaAllah.\n\nRasulullah salallahu alayhi wasallam said , “Actions are judged by intentions” (Bukhāri)\n\nIn another hadith, it is stated that people will be resurrected according to their intentions.\n\nWe make dua Allah grant you barakah in your life and time so that you become a Hafiz again in your life time. If death overtakes you while memorizing the Quran, you will die as a student of deen and as a shaheed, and you will be resurrected according to your intention of wanting to be a hafiz.\n\nJazak Allah for your duas and kind words. Make dua Allah grant us Ikhlaas. Ameen\n\n \nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n \nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
