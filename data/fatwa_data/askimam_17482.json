  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI wanted to ask that if your wife goes to jahannam then does the husband also go to jahannam????? i heard from someone that a women could take 5 people to Jahannam and if she can,, on what circumstances???\n\nI wanted to you to tell me any book about aqidah. There is a brelwi brother and hes says that  your aqidah is wrong. so can u please tell me any book or information about this.\n\nmay allah(swt) accept your work and please make dua for me.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n1)      Every person is responsible for his own actions. It is beyond the just system of Allah Ta’ala to punish one person because of the evil doings of another. It is clear in the verses of the Qur’aan:\n\nولا تكسب كل نفس إلا عليها ولا تزر وازرة وزر أخرى \n\nAnd nobody does anything but to his own account, and no person shall bear the burden of another.\n\n(Surah.6 verse.164)\n\nمن عمل صالحا فلنفسه ومن أساء فعليها وما ربك بظلام للعبيد\n\nWhoever does any good, it is for his own benefit and whoever commits an evil act, he will face the consequences, and your lord is not oppressive to his servants.  \n\n(Surah.41 verse.46)\n\nIf any person, male or female perpetrates an evil act, he or she will have to face the consequences of that act and it will not extend to a third person.\n\nIt is commonly said that a woman takes 4 people with her to Jahannam namely the husband, son, father and brother. This is based on the fact that she plays an influential role on these persons; hence if she is misguided, she could be the means of misguiding others. The others will be punished for not guarding themselves from being misled by the woman. Furthermore, they could be punished for not stopping the women from her wrong and evil deeds. That punishment is due to their negligence of Nahi anil Munkar (prohibiting from wrong) which is an obligation on every family member. In this sense, it is not that only a woman may take men to Jahannam, it could also be that men take men and women to Jahannam.    \n\n2)      Kindly find out from the Barelwi brother which part of your Aqidah is incorrect in his opinion and foward it to us.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
