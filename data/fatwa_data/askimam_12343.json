  "question": "What should hanafi do if it is raining heavy outside and the brothers want to join salat? A brother was saying a hadeeth in bukhari is that the prophet joint salat when it rained.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, joining 2 Salaat in one time is not permissible. The ?joining? in the Hadith is taken to be performing one Salaat at the end of its time and next Salaat at the very beginning of its time.\n\nIn the abovementioned situation, the brother should not join them. If the Salaat they are joining (bringing forward) is Asr or Esha, then he could join them with the niyyah of performing Nafl Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
