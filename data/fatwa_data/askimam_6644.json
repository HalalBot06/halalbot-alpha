  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Can you please explain in details the following hadith. Sayyiduna Abu Umaamah (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Whoever recites Aayaatul Kursi after every Salat, the only barrier between him and paradise will be death.' (Sahih ibn Hibbaan) 2. our imam reads a hadith for 5-10 minutes after maghrib everyday. should we wait till he finishes to perform sunnaht-e-muaqadah or start right away as angels are waiting to record the deed\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The explanation of this Hadith is that such a person is guaranteed Jannah, Insha Allah. However, this applies as long as that particular person\ndoes not commit any major sin without seeking repentance for it. In such a case this guarantee will not apply.\n2. There is no harm in delaying your Sunnat-e-Muakkadah for a short duration\nespecially for the sake of listening to the noble words of Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and for the benefit of acquiring knowledge.\n(Refer to Shaami vol.1 pg.530)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
