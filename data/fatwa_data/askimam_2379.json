  "question": "Can we pray in our university prayer room with the noise of the chapel going on below us ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Mufti Sahib. The prayer room in our uni is directly above the college chapel and when they play their organ music it is very loud and obviously a distraction during salaat. Is it permissible for us to pray in this room. Jazakallah Khairoun.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf there is no alternative, then one will be excused for performing Salaat in the referred prayer room.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
