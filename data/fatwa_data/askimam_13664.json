It is not all about making money. As Muslims, we do not compromise in our morals and good values. This is what Islam is all about. It’s a way of life in every aspect of our lives. To earn a Halaal income is emphasized in the Qur’aan and Hadith. Allah states, ‘Oh you who believe, do not eat the wealth of one another in an inappropriate way.’\n\nRasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘To earn a Halaal income is an obligation after other obligations.’ (Tirmidhi). The emphasis is on Halaal income and not just any income. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘That body that is nurtured through Haraam, the fire of hell is more deserving of it.’ (Ibid) Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] also advised that one of the questions that will be asked to an individual in the court of Allah is where did he earn his money from where did he spend it? (Muslim). Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘That person who deceives is not from among us.’ (Tirmidhi)\n\nYou say that people cheat and don’t care. That is because there is no consciousness in the people to earn Halaal. There is a need to conscientise the people. Once the people realize the importance of earning Halaal and there is a campaign driving and directing people in that direction, then people will follow. People should not be left free to do so as they want to. To prohibit wrong and point our wrongs is the duty of every Muslim. Honesty in the economy will only come with effort and education. If a few people sacrifice, that will have an overwhelming effect as truth always shines and prospers.\n\nInterest is expressly prohibited in the Qur’aan and Ahaadith. Allah and His Rasul [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] declares war against such a person. Howe can such a person be successful? Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘One dirham of interest is worse than 66 times committing Zina with one’s own mother. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Interest outwardly may show an increase but the consequences is a decrease.’ Allah shows this in a person’s life and conditions. Such a person never experiences peace in his life.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
