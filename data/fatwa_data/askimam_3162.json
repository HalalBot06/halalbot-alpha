  "question": "Is it true that we cannot wear pants that go below our ankles?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDo you agree with the following... \"Abu Dtharr reported that the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wasallam) said, There are three people whom Allah shall not speak to on the Day of Resurrection, nor shall he look at them, nor shall he purify them, and they shall have a painful torment: One whose garment hangs down below his ankles, almanaan, and (a merchant) who sells of his merchandise by means of false oath. Some people think that wearing clothes that hang below the ankles is not a sin if they abstain from doing so while praying only they believe there is no harm in doing so. However, the above and many other traditions indicate clearly that wearing clothes that hang below the ankles (for men) is a grave sin regardless of whether such garments are worn out of habit or pride. There are other authentic traditions that emphasize wearing clothing that hangs below the ankles out of pride entails harsher punishment. Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wasallam) said The part of the garment which hangs below the ankles is (punishable by) Fire (on the Day of Resurrection). The belief that wearing garments that hang below the ankles is prohibited during prayers only is a misconception commonly held by many Muslims. Such Muslims are unaware that the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wasallam) forbade praying with folded clothes. Based on this prohibition, scholars have agreed that praying with folded sleeves or pants is unlawful.\"\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo lower the pants below the ankles is prohibited at all times in Salaat or\nout of Salaat. The prohibition during Salaat will be more severe. If one\nfold the area of the pants below the ankles, it will suffice. That is not\nprohibited.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
