  "question": "Do i have my husbands ribs in me?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni would like to know if it is true that a wife has one her husbands ribs in her?My mom inlaw told me this and i wasnt sure if this is true or not, she said this because we are told that Allah created Hawa AS from the Rib of Adam AS.  Is it true?Also i would like to know what the proper method of following an Imam is?\nI would appreciate full details, what sould be read if anything or should a person just be silent?\nAlso would a male and female following behind an imam follow in the same manner or are there differences?\nCan a mother request that custody be given to her family in the event of her death if she feels that the husband and i\\his family are not capable of bringing up her daughter in a proper islamic manner?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1. Yes, Hawwaa (AS) was created from the rib of Aadam (AS). However, it doesn’t make sense to say that the wife has her husband’s rib in her.\n2. The muqtadee (person following) should stand behind the imam and remain silent for the duration of the qiraat (surah Faatihah and surah) only. The Tasbeehaat, Durood, Duaa, etc should be recited.\n3. They will follow in the same manner. However, they are not allowed to stand together. The best salaah for a woman (in words of the hadith) is the salaah one performs in the inner recess of her home.\n4. Such a request would be futile. At her death, the shariah will determine who will get custody of the child.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
