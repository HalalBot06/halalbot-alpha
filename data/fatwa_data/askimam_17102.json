  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease comment on the following article..\n\nhijabi women\n\nThe question of \"free-mixing\" over the last decade or two has gotten a bit out of hand I think. Some self-righteous and self-pious men are using this to exclude women from society. Segregation is not a concept compatible with Islam. I cannot imagine where in the Qur\"an and Sunnah it orders or even encourages that women should always be out of sight, never to be heard as equals, never to be able to contribute their God-given abilities to improve their societies and communities, never to be able to take on tasks that may take them away from their homes — or should I say kitchens to be precise?\n\nIslam never did forbid \"mixing\" of the sexes. This term \"mixing\" is used and adopted by some Muslim writers today in response to what they perceive as looseness that exists mainly in Western societies. To respond to this challenge by making statements such as \"Islam forbids free-mixing\" is to distort the teachings of Islam, and show a sign of incompetence and a lack of creativity on part of some of these writers.\nInstead, they should be articulating vigorously the true concept of hijab, how it truly liberates, rather than isolates, women. But they would rather bury their heads in the sand instead of addressing one of the most fundamental questions relating to the development of Muslim communities and societies in the 21st century, namely \"the great gender deficit.\"\n\nWomen who are just as capable and competent as, if not more so than, men in many fields of life are excluded because it is considered not appropriate, or that \"women belong at home\" or \"may\" lead to \"temptation\" if they are out and about. The Wahhabi (Arabic for: a way of practicing Islam strictly the way Prophet Muhammad practiced it), that calls for  sheikhs in some countries to ban women from driving, use this absurd and deeply offensive argument.\n\nThe sources of Islam do not dwell on physical segregation or on women's issues in particular. Rather, Islamic teachings manage human affairs and address issues common to both male and female. One can argue that on the whole, Islam encourages an interactive relationship between men and women in all areas of society, but like all other matters, Islam sets out certain boundaries. In other words \"mixing\" in the broad sense is permissible, except where it is forbidden.\n\nAlso, consider the broader question of segregation in a Muslim society.\nWhile remaining firmly attached to our religious traditions and values, we need to constantly reevaluate where our habits and customs are coming from.\n\nSome \"pious\" people feel that in a so-called true Muslim society, men and women would be so pious, they would never mix, they would walk on separate pavements, and practically live in totally separate worlds.\n\nWhere do these ideas come from? I do not believe for a moment that the Qur'an and Sunnah would teach in any terms such extremism and rigidity.\n\nhttp://www.islamonline.net/.....\n\n\nIt is shocking to hear that even in 21st century Britain, there are cases in which some pious Muslim men walk out of gatherings and meetings because there are women in the same room! \"Whether they are covered in hijab or not is not the question. They are women and they should be in separate, secluded rooms as far away as possible from the sight of men!\"\nThis is the mentality of such overzealous Muslim men.\n\nThis, I say, is total hypocrisy! You will see that these same men go to shops and are served by women (almost always uncovered non-Muslims); work with female colleagues, talk freely, sit in the same room, and eat in the same canteens; walk around in markets with women all around them; sit and stand on buses and the underground next to and close to women.\n\nWhere does this self-piety go then? If they were basing all their actions on being careful and cautious lest it may lead to temptation, then should they not be sitting at home locked away or taking a one-way ticket to a desert island to live there out of sight and out of mind?\nMaybe they should keep their own minds in check, locked up, instead of depriving half our nation of their God-given right to exist and be part of their society.\n\nThis double standard of Muslim men of our community is holding us back.\nWe must have a very radical change in the Muslim psyche, especially those who are being brought up and educated here in the UK or else we risk always being alien and our women always being second-class citizens despite the rhetoric of freedom and liberation.\n\nFinally comes the question of development of the Muslim community. To that, I would say that as long as we have half our nation chained to sinks on a full-time basis, we can keep dreaming for another millennia, God help us!\n\nAs far as I have learned, the notion of hijab is liberating rather than confining, i.e. it is precisely so that men and women can mix, rather than remain separate. If they were always separate, there is no need for the hijab, and God knows best.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n Assalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIntroduction\n\nAllah Ta'ala has made everything about Islam complete and perfect, including its injunctions and refinements in personal and social behavior. One of the last verses of the Quran to be revealed unto Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) was:\n\nالْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا\n\n\"Today, I have perfected your religion for you, and have completed My blessing upon you, and chosen Islam as Deen for you\" (5:3)\n\nIn order for us to be successful in the everlasting life of the Hereafter, it is incumbent upon us to strictly abide by the commandments of Allah Ta'ala and Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) in all aspects of life. Allah Ta'ala says:\n\nاتَّبِعُوا مَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ\n\n\"(O humankind!) Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord\" (7:3)\n\nمَنْ يُطِعِ الرَّسُولَ فَقَدْ أَطَاعَ اللَّهَ\n\n\"Whoever obeys the Messenger has surely obeyed Allah\" (4:80)\n\nIt is surely a great blessing of Allah Ta'ala that the Shari'ah of Islam has been safeguarded. Besides the unlawful crimes and sins in Shari'ah, Allah Ta'ala also forbids acts which lead to sins. For example, when the prohibition of drinking alcohol was revealed, the processing, selling, and purchasing of alcohol was prohibited as well. When interest became forbidden, all affairs involving interest became forbidden as well. Similarly, any unnecessary contact, conversation, gazing at, and avoidable instances of mixing with the opposite gender is forbidden. The sexual instinct is one of the greatest weaknesses of human beings, especially in this time of fitnah. When any of the abovementioned acts are committed unnecessarily, it is usually the spark that ignites the fire of temptation which in many cases leads to major sins such as zina (adultery, fornication). This is why these acts are considered to be a minor form of zina. Allah Ta'ala has given us a warning in the Quran by saying:\n\nوَلَا تَقْرَبُوا الزِّنَا إِنَّهُ كَانَ فَاحِشَةً وَسَاءَ سَبِيلًا\n\n\"And do not even go close to fornication. It is indeed a shameful act and an evil way to follow\". (17:32)\n\nIn this verse, Allah Ta'ala did not just say \"Do not fornicate\", but He said do not even go close to it, meaning do not do things which may lead to adultery or fornication as  Shaytan is quick to mislead the believers. Zina has become widespread in our present time, and this is one of the minor signs of Qiyamah.\n\nIt is unfortunate that in these modern times, even some so-called Muslims are completely misinterpreting our beautiful Deen, especially when it comes to the issue of women's rights. Misconception after misconception, they are distorting the truth about Islam's stance in issues such as this. At the same time, they are attempting to destroy the perfection of Deen by introducing their own laws and ideologies into Shari'ah. One such example is the article \"Muslim Men and Women Should Mix\" by Abu H. Sufyan. Not only has the author misconceived the issue of women's rights, but he has expressed the dangerous view that Muslim men and women should mix unnecessarily, without looking at the many great potential harms and consequences this may cause.\n\nThe aim of this article is to explain the proper stance on these issues according to Shari'ah. Hereunder is the Islamic viewpoint on the following:\n\na) The status of women\n\nb) Intermingling of men and women\n\nc) The ruling of hijab\n\n \n\nThe Status of Women in Islam\n\nIt is improper to deduce from western misconceptions of women’s status and rights in Islam that Islam holds her in contempt. While a person may have an inferior status in certain aspects of life, the very same person may be enjoying a superior rank in another domain. Consider a mother. While sharing in common the general rank of all women, in relation to her son, she holds a superior status notwithstanding the masculinity of the latter. And, her superiority over him remains unaffected even if he happens to be the greatest Saint on earth. In relation to him, his quest for paradise always initiates from under her feet. He cannot obtain Divine Pleasure without remaining perpetually under the yoke of her sacred feet, literally and spiritually.  If the son fails to serve his mother, like a slave for the rest of his life, he is doomed to hell-fire. Yet, she is not allowed to go on a journey without him being in escort of her. While she holds the key to unlock the doors of Jannat for her Saintly son, and whilst the safety of his Imaan is reliant on her pleasure, her testimony is equal to half his testimony.\n\nHadhrat Aishah Siddiqah (Radhiyallahu anha) narrates:\n\n\n\n“Verily, Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) cursed the rajlah among women.” (Abu Dawood V2 Pg 210 H.M.SAEED)\n\nThe term rajlah is the feminine of rajul which means ‘a man’.Thus, rajlah means ‘a manly-woman’ or a woman who imitates men. Hadhrat Aishah (radhiyallahu anha) said that such women were cursed by Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam). Women, who emulate men in their appearance, dress, attitudes, etc., are termed rajlah.A salient feature of such women is that they vie with males in fields which Allah Ta’ala has ordained exclusively or primarily for men. They seek leadership and exposure. They love public platforms and always crave to reveal themselves in public. They are generally loud and immodest. Allah Ta'ala mentions regarding such woman:\n\nوَقَرْنَ فِي بُيُوتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ الْأُولَى\n\n  “And remain inside your homes, and do not make an exhibition of yourselves like the\nexhibition (of the women of) Jahiliyyah.” (Surah Al Ahzaab V33)\n \n\n\nThe ideal woman of the Qur’an and Islam is described by the Qur’an Majeed in the following glowing terms: “(Such women who are) chaste, Simple and believing.”\nThe attributes of righteous Muslim females are Imaan, chastity and simplicity. They are not like the accursed women that resemble men who love public platforms.\n\nIn every level of society there are ranks and gradations. The concept of blanket equality is an idea of the west. Allah Ta'ala has given the men and the husbands natural leadership and strength. It is their responsibility to see to the maintenance of their families. The Quran categorically states “For men over them (woman) is a rank”. What problem do we as Muslims have with the assertion of Allah Ta ala? Western ideologies have imposed on the minds of people to understand that women in Islam are degraded and contemptible. However, the fact of the matter is that the wisdom of Allah Ta'ala is behind all of His orders, as will be explained below. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Ruling of Hijab\n\nAs Muslims, it is not upon us to question the orders of Allah Ta'ala. Allah Ta'ala is Al-Hakim (The Most Wise) and all of His commandments have hikmah (wisdom) behind them. The injunction of hijab by Allah Ta'ala is stated in several verses of the Holy Quran:\n\nوَقَرْنَ فِي بُيُوتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ الْأُولَى\n\n\"Remain in your homes, and do not display (your) beauty as it used to be displayed\nin the earlier days of ignorance\" (33:33)\n\nوَإِذَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُنَّ مَتَاعًا فَاسْأَلُوهُنَّ مِنْ وَرَاءِ حِجَابٍ ذَلِكُمْ أَطْهَرُ لِقُلُوبِكُمْ وَقُلُوبِهِنَّ\n\n\"And when you ask anything from them (the blessed wives of the Holy Prophet [Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam]),\nask them from behind a curtain. That is better for the purity of your hearts and their hearts\" (33:53)\n\nيَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ قُلْ لِأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَنِسَاءِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِنْ جَلَابِيبِهِنَّ\n\n\"O prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers that they should draw down their shawls over them\" (33:59)\n\nقل للمؤمنين يغضوا من أبصارهم ويحفظوا فروجهم ذلك أزكى لهم إن الله خبير بما يصنعون   وقل للمؤمنات يغضضن من أبصارهن ويحفظن فروجهن ولا يبدين زينتهن إلا ما ظهر منها وليضربن بخمرهن على جيوبهن ولا يبدين زينتهن إلا لبعولتهن أو آبائهن أو آباء بعولتهن أو أبنائهن أو أبناء بعولتهن أو إخوانهن أو بني إخوانهن أو بني أخواتهن أو نسائهن أو ما ملكت أيمانهن أو التابعين غير أولي الإربة من الرجال أو الطفل الذين لم يظهروا على عورات النساء ولا يضربن بأرجلهن ليعلم ما يخفين من زينتهن وتوبوا إلى الله جميعا أيها المؤمنون لعلكم تفلحون\n\n\"Tell the believing men that they must lower their gazes and guard their private parts; it is more decent for them. Surely Allah is All-Aware of what they do. And tell the believing women that they must lower their gazes and guard their private parts, and must not expose their adornment, except that which appears thereof, and must wrap their bosoms with their shawls, and must not expose their adornment, except to their husbands or their fathers or the fathers of their husbands, or to their sons or the sons of their husbands, or to their brothers or the sons of their brothers or the sons of their sisters, or to their women, or to those owned by their right hands, or male attendants having no (sexual) urge, or to the children who are not yet conscious of the shames of women. And let them not stamp their feet in a way that the adornment they conceal is known. And repent to Allah O believers, all of you, so that you may achieve success\". (24:30-31)\n\nThese verses clearly indicate the necessity of hijab and that a woman's adornments are limited to her mehrams. Women are precious jewels of the Ummah and it is the wisdom of Allah Ta'ala that they conceal their beauty. Hijab preserves a woman's dignity, honor and modesty. Modesty is an essential quality for a true Muslim. Several  Hadiths indicate the importance of modesty:\n\nالحياء من الإيمان والإيمان فى الجنة والبذاء من الجفاء والجفاء فى النار\n\n\"Modesty is from Iman, and Iman leads you to Paradise. Shamelessness is from futile things, and futile things\nlead you to the fire of Hell. (Sunan Al-Tirmidhi, Vol. 2, P. 21, HM Saeed)\n\nإن لكل دين خلقا وخلق الإسلام الحياء\n\n\"Verily in every religion there is morality, the morality of Islam is modesty\". (Sunan Ibn Majah)\n\nالحياء لا يأتى إلا بخير\n\n\"Modesty does not come except with good\". (Sahih Muslim)\n\nAs we can see in our present time, immodesty is all around us in society. In fact, Imam Ahmed (Rahmatullah Alayhi) has narrated that one of the minor signs of the Day of Judgment is that women would be clothed, yet naked (due to their style of clothing). Hijab protects a woman's adornment from the gaze of strange males.\n\nThis is why in this time of fitna, it is better for women to stay within the confinements of the home. Should she leave the home out of necessity, she must leave while observing full, proper hijab. In the time of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam), women going out in full hijab were not a cause of fitnah. This is why he had given women permission to pray at the masjid even though the reward for them praying in their homes is greater. He also had forbidden people from preventing women to go to the masjid since there was no fear of fitna. After the time of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam), the Sahaba (RadiyAllahu Anhum) realized that women going to the masjid was no longer free from apprehension of fitna. Therefore, they agreed with a consensus that women should no longer pray at the masjid. Even A'isha (RadiyAllahu Anha), the beloved wife of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam), stated that if the Prophet (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) could see the circumstances in that time, he most certainly would have stopped women from going to the masjid. The rule changed according to the conditions of the time. If women covered in full hijab were not permitted to go out in the times of the Sahaba (RadiyAllahu Anhum) due to fitna, then surely in our time the fitna has greatly expanded and it has become ever so dangerous for Muslim women to go out unnecessarily without a mehram male.\n\nTherefore, the hijab is a means of protecting Muslim women from sin and it is a means of protecting their modesty, dignity, and honor in Islam. Besides this it is a clear command of Allah Ta'ala towards the believers which must be obeyed. Those believers who willingly abide by the rules of Allah Ta'ala will surely be rewarded.\n\n \n\nIntermingling of Men and Women\n\nAs was stated earlier, the perfection of Islam removes the possible causes and roots which may breed corruption. It is greatly known that the sexual instinct is one of the greatest weaknesses in humans. This is why unnecessary intermingling of the sexes is prohibited. We see that in mixed gatherings the natural desire in man is aroused which eventually leads to sin. This can start out with something such as glancing at a non-mehram woman which may lead to conversation and eventually a major sin such as zina. Glancing at a non-mehram woman intentionally has been forbidden in Hadith:\n\nBuraida reported that the Messenger of Allah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) said to Ali (RadiyAllahu Anhu): “O Ali! Do not allow your glance to follow a glance, because the first (glance) is forgiven and not the second. (Narrated by Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud and Imam Ahmad).\n\nThis is why Islam takes a preventive measure by forbidding such gatherings from the beginning.  \n\nEven in the time of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) when women were permitted to pray at the masjid due to no fear of fitna, women were in a separate area from the men. This is evident in the Hadith of Bukhari narrated by Ibn Abbas (RadiyAllahu Anhu) which states that on 'Eid, Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to offer a sermon. Immediately afterward he delivered the same sermon to the women.\n\nIbn Hajr Asqalaani (Rahmatullah Alayhi) states in Fathul Bari (his commentary of Sahih al-Bukhari) that the fact that he went to the women separately shows that the women were assembled separately from the men and were not mixed in with them.\n\nA Hadith narrated by Umm Salamah (RadiyAllahu Anha) states that when the Prophet (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) completed the prayer, the women would get up to leave. He would then wait awhile before standing. Ibn Shahab said: \"I believe he waited for a while to give the women an opportunity to depart before the men\". (Sahih al-Bukhari)\n\nIbn Hajr Asqalaani (Rahmatullah Alayhi) mentions that in this Hadith, we see that it is disliked for men and women to mix on the road. How much more, then, should such mixing be avoided inside of houses? (Fathul Bari)\n\nAnother Hadith narrated by A'isha (RadiyAllahu Anha) says that a woman extended her hand from behind a curtain to hand a piece of paper to the Prophet (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) The Messenger of Allah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) pulled his hands back and said: “I don't know if this is a mans hand or a women's hand.” A'isha (RadiyAllahu Anha) said that it was a woman's hand. (Abu Dawud)\n\nThis Hadith is clear that the companions of the Prophet (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to observe separation (hijab) in a way that there use to be a curtain or a veil between the sexes. If free mixing was acceptable, then there was no need for this.\n\nThese Hadiths clearly show the dislike for intermingling. As mentioned in the introduction, it is through the infinite wisdom of Allah Ta'ala that He has prohibited such things, as He knows the weaknesses of His creation. This is why Allah Ta'ala said to not even go close to fornication or adultery, as these are the ways illicit relationships begin.\n\nFinally, if one must be at a place out of necessity where men and women are mixed, e.g. the market or the workplace, then one must observe proper covering and keep the gaze lowered and controlled. All unnecessary conversations must be avoided and if conversation does have to take place, then it must be straight to the point. In such cases, women should not use a soft tone, rather they should use a more harsh tone. One must have the fear of Allah Ta'ala at all times.\n\n \n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Allah Ta'ala has made Islam so perfect that He has forbidden many acts which can lead to major sins. Unnecessary intermingling between men and women will undoubtedly lead one to sin at some point or the other, which is why it is forbidden. The ruling of hijab upon women is to protect her honor, dignity, modesty, and status in Islam. It is incumbent upon us to follow the orders of Allah Ta'ala without questioning them, as Allah is the Supreme and All-Wise. Those who obey the orders of Allah will surely be rewarded on the day when only one's deeds will matter.\n\nWe ask Allah Ta'ala to keep us on the correct path and to give us the ability to fulfill His injunctions upon us.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
