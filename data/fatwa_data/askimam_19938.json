  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalāmualaikum. Recently I have been feeling a huge depression inside me.  I have lost interest in studies and in any kind of work.  I remain sad/upset and get anxious for no reason.  Please tell me something with regards to Qurān and Hadīth.  Why am I feeling so useless and uncomfortable?  I failed doing anything I wanted to do.  Isha Allāh I will wait to hear from your team.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nThe inner feelings and conditions of every human being vary from time to time.  Sometimes one feels very happy and excited while at other times one feels sad and unpleasant.  This is part of life.  This should not cause one to lose hope and become despondent.\n\nPondering over the blessings and favors of Allāh upon you will give you internal contentment and satisfaction. Think of the blessings allotted to you by Allāh Ta’ālā that have not been granted to others.  There are so many people who cannot see, hear, or talk. Imagine if Allāh did not bestow us with these faculties, how straitened life would become.  Every time you drink a cold glass of water, know that there are people who are struggling to acquire a single sip.  Thereafter praise Allāh for favoring you with such bounties.  This will create the love of Allāh within your heart and you will feel content and satisfied.  This is a prescription given by Allāh Ta’ālā Himself to Nabī Sallallāhu A’laihi Wa Sallam in the Qurān.  Almighty Allāh Ta’ālā says:\n\n \n\nوَلَقَدْ نَعْلَمُ أَنَّكَ يَضِيقُ صَدْرُكَ بِمَا يَقُولُونَ () فَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ وَكُنْ مِنَ السَّاجِدِينَ (سورة الحجر، رقم الاية 97-98)\n\n \n\nAnd We know that your heart feels distressed for what they say.  So proclaim the purity and glory of your Rabb and be among those who prostrate.\n\n(Qurān 15:97-98)\n\n\n \n\nConsider taking out some time daily and sitting in seclusion for the Dhikr (remembrance of Allāh).  On a daily basis, set a time wherein you recite the Kalimah Lā Ilāh Illallāh.  Think of the might and grandeur of Allāh Ta’ālā while doing Dhikr.  Have conviction in your heart that each time you recite the Kalimah Allāh Ta’ālā is filling your heart with divine light.  Through the Dhikr of Allāh, Allāh Ta’ālā will give you contentment of heart.  Allāh Ta’ālā says in the Qurān:\n\nأَلَا بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ (سورة الرعد، رقم الاية 28)\n\nBehold! The hearts find peace through the remembrance of Allāh.\n\n (Qurān 13:28)\n\n \n\n \n\nLastly, have confidence in yourself.  Keep your spirits high.  Involve yourself in those permissible activities that you enjoy. \n\nWe ask Allāh Ta’ālā to grant you happiness and success in both the worlds. Amīn.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Abdul Azīm bin Abdur Rahman,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\nUS\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
