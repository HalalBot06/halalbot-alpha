  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am living in Saudi Arabia.Here ,you might be knowing for sure, that is big influence of people who do not follow ant imam. Here Dawa center setup by govt. is responsible for dawa.One of my colegue, hailing from kerela India, I too belong to India, has forwarded me a book , on Tableeghi Jamat and Deoband ,name of the book is \"Tablighi jamat and Deobandis, A critical ana;ysis of thier belief, faith and \" written by Sajid Abdul Qayyum , printed in Sharjah.This book is circulated widely among peoples to prove the creed of Ulema e deoband is false..etc.Alham do lillah I did'nt bothered to pay sencond glance at this book,but I want that If you\n\nhave enough time to go through this book , please go through it ..and kindly advise how to deal in such situation.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nWe have reviewed the mentioned book and have concluded that the compiler has misunderstood the creed of the Deobandis and the Tablig-Jamat. His writings are based on assumptions and it is not advisable for the layman to read the mentioned book due to the concocted way the author has written.\n\nThe ample good that has stemmed from the Deobandis and the Tablig-Jamat stands out universal. Thus, being the greatest testimony of their correctness. It is recommended that one consult a trustworthy Alim as to which books are suitable for reading and refrain from reading the books of non scholarly personalities whose personage and nature is unknown.\n\nThe following link may be viewed on this subject;\n\nhttp://www.askimam.org/fatwa/fatwa.php?askid=16332e682fc01b61c002a9ba9e9d1bf5\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
