It is a lifelong relationship and therefore it is important to be wise in choosing a partner. Compatibility between the spouses is essential. Islam does not recognize any virtue on account of a person’s lineage color etc. but at the same time it does not totally ignore the fact that people from different tribes, clans and villages have different ways of life. Furthermore, the social standing, the financial position etc of a person also has an impact on a person’s life which could lead to an imbalanced married life thereby causing disastrous after effects. Take for example, if a woman from a noble wealthy family, who all her life lived in luxury, gets married to a poor person who can barely pay for his basic necessities of life, how can they have a happy married life? Incompatibility is one main cause for the braking up of homes. It is for this reason that if a woman gets married to an incompatible man without the consent of her guardian, Islam has allowed the guardian the right of bringing this marriage to an end. It is not that Islam divides by race and color rather, it is that Islam takes into consideration the betterment for the family and society at large. At the same time, whilst this permission is granted it should not be abused. If the spouses are compatible they should not be stopped from getting married merely based on the fact that he is not from the same city (or gham). This is totally against the spirit and teachings of Islam. On the other hand if the family consents to such a marriage then it will also be perfectly fine. For example a woman from a rich family marries a poor man because of his good character, knowledge etc. then there is nothing wrong.\n\nAfter this brief introduction, we respond to your queries:\n\n1.      Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم married women from different tribes. Nabi صلى الله عليه وسلم had eleven wifes, six were from the Quraysh, four were from different Arabs tribes and one was a non-Arab, from the Bani Israil.\n\n(Sharh al-Zurqani ala al-Mawahib 4-356)\n\n2.      Nabi صلى الله عليه وسلم did allow nikah to a person who had merely his basic necessities.\n\n \n\nصحيح البخاري\n\n5087 - حدثنا قتيبة حدثنا عبد العزيز بن أبي حازم عن أبيه عن سهل بن سعد الساعدي قال\n\nجاءت امرأة إلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فقالت يا رسول الله جئت أهب لك نفسي قال فنظر إليها رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فصعد النظر فيها وصوبه ثم طأطأ رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم رأسه فلما رأت المرأة أنه لم يقض فيها شيئا جلست فقام رجل من أصحابه فقال يا رسول الله إن لم يكن لك بها حاجة فزوجنيها فقال وهل عندك من شيء قال لا والله يا رسول الله فقال اذهب إلى أهلك فانظر هل تجد شيئا فذهب ثم رجع فقال لا والله ما وجدت شيئا فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم انظر ولو خاتما من حديد فذهب ثم رجع فقال لا والله يا رسول الله ولا خاتما من حديد ولكن هذا إزاري قال سهل ما له رداء فلها نصفه فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ما تصنع بإزارك إن لبسته لم يكن عليها منه شيء وإن لبسته لم يكن عليك منه شيء فجلس الرجل حتى إذا طال مجلسه قام فرآه رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم موليا فأمر به فدعي فلما جاء قال ماذا معك من القرآن قال معي سورة كذا وسورة كذا عددها فقال تقرؤهن عن ظهر قلبك قال نعم قال اذهب فقد ملكتكها بما معك من القرآن\n\n \n\n3.      Nabi صلى الله عليه وسلم said:\n\n \n\nA woman gets married for four reasons: for her wealth, her lineage, her beauty and her religion. So be successful by marring for religion.\n\n \n\nصحيح البخاري ومسلم\n\nعن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال تنكح المرأة لأربع لمالها ولحسبها وجمالها ولدينها فاظفر بذات الدين تربت يداك\n\n4.      The only virtue in the sight of Allah Ta’ala is on religion and piety. Nabi صلى الله عليه وسلم mentioned: none has any virtue over the other except in religion and piety. (Ibn Khathir Hujurat 13)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl. Ishaq E.
