  "question": "Why is Allah permitting these Hindus to commit such evil? Is there a special dua that we can offer to ease the comforts for our fellow Muslims in Gujarat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Sahib, Muslims in Gujarat, India have recently experienced extreme torture under the hands of the Extremist Hindus. Thousands of Muslim women were raped and killed. Innocent Muslims were burned, killed and numerous lost their families. I came across various articles, such as the information provided in a magazine Communalism Combat (www.sabrang.com) - March-April 2002 issue, which described the tortures that our Gujarati muslim brothers and sisters faced. It has left me extremely disturbed and it makes me think as to why nothing has been done to stop this torture. Why is Allah permitting these Hindus to commit such evil? Is there a special dua that we can offer to ease the comforts for our fellow Muslims in Gujarat? Your kind guidance regarding this matter will be appreciated. Jazakallah Khair!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDifficulties do not always come about because of sin. If this was indeed the%0D%0Acase, the prophets would never have suffered any misfortune.%0D%0A%0D%0ASometimes, Allah Ta'ala inflicts minor calamities that prevent major%0D%0Acalamities. Sometimes, people are tested by Allah Ta'ala to ascertain their%0D%0Adegree of forbearance before Allah. Difficulties are also a cause for reward%0D%0Aand elevation of one's status in the hereafter.

When one limb (of the body) complains, that effects the entire body by being awake and having fever.? (Mishkaat pg.422; Qadeemi)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadith 2%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Musa (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?A believer to a believer is like a building that strengthens one another (with each brick).? (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadith 3%0D%0AHadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?A Muslim is a brother of another Muslim, so do not oppress him and do not hand him over (to the mercy of the enemies when he is in trouble).? (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadith 4%0D%0AHadhrat Aamir ibn Maalik, the leader of the tribe of Bani Sulaym requested the help of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) against the enemies of his tribe. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) accepted his request and sent seventy Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) who were Qurraa (experts in the recitation of the noble Qur?aan). The tribe of Banu Sulaym surrounded these Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) by a place called Bir Ma?oona and murdered them.%0D%0A%0D%0AJibraaeel (Alayhis salaam) informed Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) of the incident and conveyed to him the heartfelt message of the Qurraa:%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A?Inform our people that we met our Rabb. He was pleased with us and (in turn) pleased us.?%0D%0A%0D%0AThis incident caused great grief to Rasulullah. Abdullah ibn Mas?ood (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) recited Qunoot Naazila for one month continuously cursing the tribe of Bani Sulaym. (Bukhari vol.2 pg.586; Thanwi)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn view of the above, the Fuqahaa have ruled that when the Ummat is in a crisis, they should follow the Sunnah practise of Qunoot-e-Naazila and make Du?aa for the Ummah.%0D%0A%0D%0A%0AOnce again Daarul Islaam (Afghanistan) and Daarul Kufr (America and its allies) are at crossroads and we should resort to the Sunnat practise of Qunoot-e-Naazila.%0D%0A%0D%0AMETHOD OF QUNOOT-E-NAAZILA%0D%0A%0D%0A%B7 In Fajr Salaat, after the Ruku of the second Rakaat, the Imaam will make audible Du?aa. The Muqtadee (followers) will listen to the Du?aa and say, ?Aameen? softly during the pauses of the Imaam?s Du?aa. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyyah vol.2 pg.138)%0D%0A%0D%0A%B7 The Muqtadis will not recite the Du?aa with the Imaam. (I?elaa-us-Sunan vol.6 pg.120; Idaratul Qur?aan)%0D%0A%0D%0A%B7 The Imaam and the Muqtadis should not raise their hands during the Du?aa. The hands should be left by their sides. (Shaami vol.2 pg.9; HM Saeed)%0D%0A%0D%0A%B7 Upon completion of the Du?aa, they will go into Sajdah and complete the Salaat as normal.%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Qunoot-e-Naazila may be recited by the Imaam during Fajr Salaat. A Munfarid (person performing Fardh Salaat individually) may not recite Qunoot-e-Naazila. (Shaami vol.2 pg.11; HM Saeed)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. One may also recite Qunoot-e-Naazila in Nafl Salaat, performed individually during the night. (Fataawa Mahmoodiya vol.2 pg.138)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Females may also recite Qunoot-e-Naazila in Nafl Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE QUNOOT (DU'AA)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates: Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) would teach us the following Du'aa to be recited in the Salaat of Fajr:%0D%0A%0D%0AAllahumma ihdinaa feeman hadayta, Wa?aafinaa feeman aafayta%0D%0AWa tawallanaa feeman tawallayta, Wa baarik lanaa feemaa a-atwayta%0D%0AWa qinaa sharr maa qadhayta, Innakaa taqdhiy walaa yuqdhaa alayka%0D%0AWa inaahoo laa yadhillu man waalayta, Walaa ya-izzu man ?aadayta%0D%0ATabaarakta rabbanaa wa ta?aalayta, Nastaghfiruka wa natoobu ilayka%0D%0AWa salla llaahu alan nabiyyil kareem%0D%0AAllaahumma ighfir lanaa wa lilmu?mineena wal mu?minaat wal muslimeena wal muslimaat%0D%0AWa allif bayna quloobihim, wa as-lih dhaata baynihim%0D%0AWa-nsurhuma alaa aduwwika wa aduwwihim%0D%0AAllaahummal anil kafarata lladheema yasuddoona an sabeelika, wa yukadh-dhiboona rusulika wa yuqaatiloona awliyaa-aka%0D%0AAllaahumma khaalif bayna kalimatihim wa zalzil aqdaamahum wa anzil bihim ba-asaka lladhiy laa tarudduhoo anil qawmil mujrimeen%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Ulama have advised that the Du?aa should be according to the prevailing situation. (Subul-salaam vol.1 pg.186; Darun Nashril Kitaab)%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore, other Du?aas narrated in the Qur?aan or Hadith or such Du?aas not resembling Kalaamun-Naas (such speech that can be sought from people as well) may be recited in Arabic. To recite Du?aas during Salaat in any other language is Makrooh-e-Tahrimi. (Shami vol.1 pg.524;HM Saeed)%0D%0A%0D%0AIssued by:%0D%0ADARUL IFTA - MADRASAH IN'AAMIYYAH, CAMPERDOWN"
