  "answer": "QUESTION\nASAW Mufti saheb Please answer my query. What shall a person do when someone shows clear proofs from Quran, Ahadith to put his point. Shall we believe or not . If not then what is the criteria for us to judge who is right and who is wrong since as we understand the touch-stone is Quran and authentic ahadiths. Heard some of the persons saying that we should consult Aalim. We understand that we should consult Aalim but for the things which are clear, like the meaning of Bismillah-hir- Rehman- raheem one does not require Aalim for its meaning , similarly for clear hadiths and Quranic translations can we accept it ??? If not then shall we keep searching Aalims for even things which are clear . If that is so , then shall we stop reading Quran/Hadith with understanding or with its meaning; since we understand not everything is complex to understand as our Deen is very simple. for eg: (Asar salath time as per hadith in which Jibraeal A.S. has shown Prophet S.A.W.S timings of different prayers) Asar salaah timings as mentioned in (Muslim, Almasjid, Awaqqat salaat khams, 613, Sahi muslim almsajid 622) Fajr sunnah can be offered after fajr Farz if one misses it (Darul-qutni 1/383,384 ,, Baihaki 2/283 ,, Ibn Khuzema 116).... Then y the views of Fuqaha are held over authentic hadiths.. Please answer with clear proofs from Quran , Hadiths 2. Can the name \"Aqsa\" be kept for a baby girl Thanks\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta?ala has given mankind, in general, Aql Saleem or sound intellect. By this man can distinguish between the simple and the complex. %0D%0A%0D%0ATake for example, in the field of medicine there are simple issues, and there are the complex ones. If one has a simple cut, one does not need to consult a doctor in order to put on a plaster. However, if one?s appendix has burst, it would be foolish to treat it by one?s self. It does not mean that all medical issues are simple, nor does it mean that all medical issues are complex. How does one then decide if an issue is simple or complex? It boils down to knowledge and a sound intellect. %0D%0A%0D%0AIf a person lacks this sound intellect then we can expect him%2Fher to visit the doctor to administer a plaster, or to do self surgery. %0D%0A%0D%0ASometimes a certain Aayat or Hadith may be simple on the face value, but when viewed in the light of other Aayaat or Ahaadith it becomes complex.%0D%0A%0D%0ARegarding the time of Asr the Ahaadith differ. We therefore refer to the Fuqaha to guide us in this matter. There is not just one Hadith on the subject as inferred by you. %0D%0A%0D%0ARegarding the question of missing of the Sunnah of Fajr, we could not find the text referred to. Kindly provide a more detail reference. %0D%0A%0D%0AThe views of the fuqaha only come into play when there are conflicts between the demands of the various Aayaat and Ahaadith.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Aqsa is not actually a name. It is a word meaning further or furthest%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
