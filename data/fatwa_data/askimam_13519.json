Divorce will take place only if the husband issues his wife with a divorce.\n\nHowever, if the husband states to his wife that he will not be intimate with her for four months, then only 1 divorce will take place upon the expiry of four months if the husband keeps up to his promise and does not be intimate with her. This is called I’elaa in Shari’ah. If he becomes intimate with her, he will have to offer a compensation for breaking his promise.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
