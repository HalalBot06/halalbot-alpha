  "question": "Respected Imam Sahab, what is the sanctity of a paper marriage,that is just nikah and no rukhsati,according to our islamic laws. Kindly help me with this.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI got nikad a month back,e/thing happened within a week's time,though i got a fair chance to meet the guy,i somehow had become emotionless,and leaving e/thing to ALLAH whom i am a staunch believer,and to my parents said yes.it was after the nikah,that i made myself,and my lovely,loving parents misreable,b/c somehow i still cant accept him,i think i am more focused on his looks,as he is an average looking guy,or what is it idont know.in about 4 month's time is my rukhsati,and the thought scares me.i am to some extent pretty religious,have performed HAJJ,recently,and i keep telliny myself that nothing bad can ever happen b/c ALLAH loves HIS creations alot.sorry for such a long story,IMAM SAHAB.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe union through Nikaah is sacred and both spouses are duty bound by\nShariah to honor this sacred bond by fulfilling each others rights. The\nreason for not being able to accept your husband due to his looks,\nespecially after having seen him before marriage is not appropriate. You\nshould focus your mind on the essence of the union through Nikaah. It is a\nlong journey of life that has to be shared by both of you. If your husband\nis pious and has a good character, and will be able to care for you\n(especially having been chosen by your parents) then you can be optimistic\nof a successful marriage. Many pretty women have handsome husbands of ill\ncharacter, who then make their wives' life a hell on earth. You do not know\nwhat lies ahead of you should you decide not to continue with this sacred\nbond. We advise you to place your trust in Allah Ta'ala and respect the\nsacred bond of Nikaah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMuft"
