  "question": "Is one allowed to make duaa facing the graves of the dead by raising the hands, or should one face the Kaaba. Is the shirk?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nCould you also please explain what is and what is not allowed at graveyards as I am confused.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible to face the graves and make Du?aa to Allah Ta?ala on condition it is not understood and believed that the death is being beseeched.
