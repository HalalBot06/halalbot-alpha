  "question": "What is real position of ANAMI SCHEMES lounched by variousn advertisered on TV in Pakistan in accorance with Quran and Sunnah.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs you saw on TV that lot of advertiser are lounching various ANAMI SCHEMES as well as various companies are advertising their products in very same style. You will well aware of these schemes. However, I will point out two schemes here. Firstly, one or more questions are assked from the viewers and try to provoke the viewer to anser that qustion on telephone. If he gives right answer then he will be given price in the shape of amount. In second scheme, companies advertised their product and introduce an ANAMI SCHEME. They ask their buyers that if they sent some used packets or rappers of their product then he will win some price through draw. I think the basic aim behind these schemes is gin the money and generate greed among the peoples. Therefore, u are requested to guide me what is real position of these schemes in accorance with Quran and Sunnah. Please also uote references.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe are in South Africa and we do now know the schemes.\n\nAccording to our understand of the scheme as explained by you, a person may enter a competition by sending a used packet or wrapper of the company?s product and one may win a price. If our understanding is correct, and there is no money charged to enter the competition then it is permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
