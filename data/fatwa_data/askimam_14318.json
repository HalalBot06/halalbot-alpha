  "question": "What is the importance of hope?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n My question is regarding hope. I only know that hope is required by a person who hopes for the mercy of Allah and also when and after making Dua.\n\n \n\n I believe that everything is in Allah’s hands no matter what we do.\n\n \n\n So, my first questions are:\n\n \n\n 1.      What is the importance of hope?\n\n2.      Do I need to have a feeling of hope within myself after making Dua and after making effort to full fill a task?\n\n \n\nSometimes I make Dua for anything – things that I need and things that I don’t need really but then I hope that they get full filled in this world only for the purpose of motivating myself to make more Dua and do more good deeds and thereby get closer to Allah. Sometimes, the Duas are not accepted in this world, even though I had hoped that Allah would accept the Dua. The consequence of this is that I get despondent and I feel myself to have been distanced from Allah because I had hoped that Allah would accept the Dua in the way I wanted and it didn’t happen. Bear in mind that what I have asked for, had I of have got it, it wouldn’t have been harmful. So, my next question is:\n\n \n\n3.      Can I make Dua and say in my heart, “If the Dua is not accepted within a specific time period then I stop having hope and then if gets accepted then good and I will thank Allah, if not then it is  not I was expecting it to happen.”\n\n \n\nI believe the above quote will be beneficial to me personally because it will prevent me from getting despondent after the time period has elapsed and therefore I don’t feel that I have myself distanced from Allah.\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Imam Muslim () has recorded a Hadith of Rasulullah (Salalaahu Alayhi Wasallam) wherein he said \"Imaan of a believer is between fear and hope\". While commentating on this Hadith, Imam Suyuti Rahimhullah writes that \"A believer should be dominated by the fear of Allah in time of his youth. However, once old age dawns, one should have hope on the mercy of Allah and wish His forgiveness and pardon\".\n\n2. In a hadith Rasulullah Salalaahu Alayhi Wasallam said \"Make Dua to Allah with the conviction of the Dua being accepted\" . in another narration it is reported that Allah deals with people according to their expectations from Him. Therefore you should have conviction that Allah has indeed accepted your and you should not doubt that at all.\n\n3. It is incorrect to do such a thing. In one narration Nabi Salalaahu Alayhi Wasallam is reported to have said \" Allah accepts the Dua of a believer as long as he is not hasty\". Allah is All Wise. He knows what is best for us. Therefore if your Dua is not accepted you should reflect that perhaps that was not good for me.\n\n4. In a Hadith recorded in Tirmizi Rasulullah (Salalaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said \"every Dua of a believer is accepted in three ways. Either Allah grants a person whatever he asked for or Allah removes some calamity from him or Allah stores that Dua for him in the Hereafter. Thereafter Rasulullah (Salalaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said \"if he will see the Duas that were stored for him he would wish that none of his duas were accepted in the world and that all be stored for him in the Hereafter.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
