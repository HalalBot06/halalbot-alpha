  "question": "It is said that the Shayateen are locked away during Ramadan. If this is the case, then how can they still influence us during our prayers, by making our minds wander, etc.?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAnd why is there still mischief all around us, even during this blessed month? Secondly, if the Shayateen are so smart, and with so many powers, and they can be still ?chained? by Allah Taala for one month, why don?t they realize that HE has ultimate power over them, and could chain them down for ever if HE wishes so, and which one day, no doubt HE will.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to some Muhadditheen, during Ramadaan only the big Shayeteen are\nchained. The mischief is then perpetrated by the small Shayateen. According\nto other Muhadditheen, all the Shayateen are chained, the big and the small.\nThe mischief during Ramadaan is then due to the habits of a person which he\nbuilt up over a period of time.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
