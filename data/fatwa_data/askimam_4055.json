  "question": "What, if any, is the significance of the crescent in Islam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Crescent and Star have no resemblance or significance and as such are\nnot sacred symbols of Islam. The companions (Radhiyallaahu Ánhum) asked the\nProphet (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) about the reality of the Hilaal\n(crescent), Allah Taãla revealed the verse, 'Say, the Hilaal is a means of\ncalculating time for people.' It is perhaps for this (and maybe other\nreasons) that the crescent took some distinctive role in the character of\nsymbolising identification for Muslims.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
