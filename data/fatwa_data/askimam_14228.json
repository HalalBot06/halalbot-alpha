An ideal and significant book which explains the various aspects of Deen and is easy to understand is the English translation of Bahishti Zewar – authored by Moulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi [ra].\n\n2. It is permissible to work for a store that sells a variety of items even though a few of the items are Haraam. The income earned from such a store is Halaal. However, it is incumbent on this person (Cashier) to seek forgiveness from Allah Ta’ala as he is an agent of the owner of the store which sells Haraam items and is indirectly assisting the customer in purchasing Haraam items.\n\n3. Listening to music causes hypocrisy in the heart of a great Taabi’ee by the name of Mak-hool has mentioned this. (As-samaa wal Ghinaal; Mulla Ali Qari pg.11)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
