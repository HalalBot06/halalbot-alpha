  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI wanted to know if one uses paint brushes that are made from pig, and we only find out now that we had painted the house with those, what can we do about this situation? I know when you buy these brushes and find out then you have to throw them away but what if you had already used them on your walls?\n\n Also, i know that the place that has the pork on it will be contaminated. But what if it is in a can, will anything that touches that get contaminated? what about ones pets that cann't eat fish because they are allergic? what can one give them? can one give them the cat food that has meat and meat derivatives in it since they are allergic to fish.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The wall that is painted with a paint brush having pig bristles will be considered to be pure.\n\n2. One will not become impure if he touches the can that contains pork.\n\n3. If one’s pet cannot eat fish and there is no other alternative besides meat derivatives, then he will be excused for giving his pet meat derivative.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
