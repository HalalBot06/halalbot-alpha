  "question": "Validity of Wudu",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-o-Alaikum I wanted to ask U about the validity of my wudu as the discharge keeps coming out after every half hour n i have small kids n lots of work to do n I am unable to change clothes specially the lower dress when it becomes impure wiyh a transparent discharge.I have also read ur RULES REGARDING MAAZOOR but did'nt find the answer to my query. My question is that can I pray in the same clothes in which discharge cums out the whole day as it is almost impossible for me to change clothes each time I pray though I do wash my self n make a fresh wudu for every salat after dischare. Jazakumullah for ur help.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf you wash yourself, change your sanitary pad or lining and make Wudhu, that is sufficient. There is no need to change or wash your clothes if they are not soiled with any impurity.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
