  "question": "Am I considered to be napaak if I find wetness in the region of my private parts and I know that it was not urine and that I did not get an erection.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am at College and come into contact with a non muslim female in my class (she is the only female in the class). The class is small and to avoid her is difficult. I am not married and do not have any female friends. Even though I try, but I cannot help but think about her. Sometimes in class when I am near her or talk to her I find that there has been some sort of fluid release from my penis even though I did not get an erection (I also don't think it was a urine release). I would like to know if this makes me napaak or am I still paak? Can I perform Salaah in this state? Can I just wash my private part to become paak so that I can perform Salaah otherwise I have to miss my Namaaz? Do I need Ghusal or do I have to remove the piece of clothing that is wet or is it ok if the wetness dries and will I then be considered paak? Please advise me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe wetness is Mazi, which is impure and nullifies the Wudhu.\n\nThe private parts and the soiled portion of the undergarment should be washed before performing Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
