May Allah Ta'ala protect you from your enemies, Aameen.\n2. Yes, it will be permissible to sell water if he preserved it. (Hidaaya\nvol.4 pg.487)\n3. It is undesirable (Makrooh) for a person to stand alone in a Saff.\nInstead, in such a case, he should pull a person back who is standing in the\nSaff in front of him and make him stand in the line with him. But if there\nis the possibility that the person will disrupt his Salaat or take this\nunkindly, then he should not do this. (Bahishti Zewar vol.2 pg.165;\nAzaadville)\n4. Kindly refer below our standard reply to similar queries.\n5. It is Makrooh to stun and then slaughter an animal if it is possible to\nslaughter it without stunning, e.g. a sheep. However, to eat the meat will\nbe permissible. If the animal is wild that it can only be slaughtered by\nstunning, then it will not be Makrooh.
