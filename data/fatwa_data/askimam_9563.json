  "answer": "QUESTION\nI had a wet dream and think that my mattress also got soiled because I was sleeping on my stomach. Does the entire mattress become napaak or just the area that I think got soiled?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf there is any trace of impurity on the mattress, then only the impurity has to be washed out.
