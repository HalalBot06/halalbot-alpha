  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it true that if a husband and wife have a child and that child passes away at the age of one or two at the time of death the husband and wife go stright to the child? How about there other children? and there sins? Also is there any dua that can be prayed to improve eyesight?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are great rewards for a person who lost his children during infancy. The parents undergo enormous pain and grief and will be rewarded by Allah for that. According to one Hadith, the child will intercede for the parents on the day of judgment and, Allah willing, the intercession will be accepted. The child will be a means of the parents entering Jannah. All this will be on the day of judgment.\n\nWe have not come across a narration that the parents will go to their child upon death.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
