  "question": "What if i dont want to go to Jannah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI don't understand what you're trying to say. 1) First of all, if a woman wants a husband with no other wives in Jannah, can she have it? Even if her husband from the dunya wants multiple wives, does she have to be with him over there?, 2) Obviously, if the answer to 1) is no, than women won't want fidelity from their husbands in Jannah, because Allah swt is going to remove all sense of injury from their hearts, but even in that case, what is the significance of the fact that men don't have to make any compromises and women do? I just don't see how the relationship between men and Allah swt and women and Allah swt can be the same with the above in mind.\n\nYou're right; we should just be worried about entering Jannah and leave the rest up to Allah swt, but you see, women have no idea what to expect in Jannah. All they know is all men will have whatever they desire in Jannah, and by the very fact that there is polygamy even there, women have reason to doubt they'll get what they want. It seems rather as if women should consider themselves lucky to be allowed into a man's Paradise. I know you said they will be gifted and not made into gifts, but their wants are being erased, so maybe their very nature will become to want to be gifts?\n\nLet me ask you something else, does Allah swt encourage people to become awliya? What I mean is, Alhumdulillah I am doing the utmost in completing my faraaidh to the best of my ability and avoiding sin, but what if I don't want to be closer to Allah swt? What if I want to just fulfill my duties so inshAllah I won't go to jahannum, but I don't want to go to Jannah either? Can I just remain dead forever or something? I'm tired of this. I'm starting to have suicidal thoughts. I just can't stand it anymore. Is asking to die the same as asking never to be born? Don't be alarmed. I won't do it probably, because I know it's haraam, I just mean that I just don't know what to do anymore.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe premise of your objections is based on your answer no. Why is it not possible to be yes? Furthermore, have you ruled out the possibility of Allah cultivating the heart of a female or male in conformity to the others wish? Also, why do you believe that the nature of women in Jannah will be to “want to be gifts”? In fact, the very nature of the inmates of Jannah will be to desire for themselves. It is beyond us to reconcile all the intricacies of Jannah’s in relation to the temperament of all the creations of Allah. If we truly believe in our limits then we will submit to Allah and His infinite knowledge. Your following query of not wanting to go to Jannah stems from your misunderstanding of the previously discussed complexities.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
