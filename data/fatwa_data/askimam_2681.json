  "question": "When purchasing a product,is it permissible to accept a loan from a third party at a value higher that the principle amount ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsaw, Respected Mufti saheb, my question is best explained by an example.Person A Wishes to buy a vehicle from B for R100,000, but he does not have enough cash, so person C offers to purchase this vehicle from B for R100,000 and sell it back to A at R3000 per month over 3 years ie a total of R108,000 (R8,000 over the original amount).However if person A did not want the vehicle at all then person C would not have purchased it at all. Is this transaction permissible?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nThe purchase and sale agreements between B & C, C & A are valid.\n\nHowever, C undertakes a risk of purchasing the vehicle from B to sell it to\nA as A may decline to purchase the vehicle from C.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
