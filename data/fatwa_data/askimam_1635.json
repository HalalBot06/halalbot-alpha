According to the Islamic Law of Succession and Inheritance, distribution of an Estate will only commence after funeral expenses, debts (including legal costs) and bequests (if any) made to non-heirs - which will not exceed one-third (1/3) of the Estate after debts and funeral expenses - have been settled. Thereafter, all assets form part of the Nett Estate and will have to be distributed according to the Islamic Law of Succession and Inheritance as follows. The nett Estate will be divided into eighty (80) equal shares and distributed as follows: Wife receives : 10 shares Each daughter receives : 7 shares Each son receives : 14 shares and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai FATWA DEPT."
