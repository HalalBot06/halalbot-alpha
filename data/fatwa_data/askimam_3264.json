  "question": "His mom refused to our marriage.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI'm an Indian muslim sunni girl who wishes to marry a Pakistani muslim sunni boy. We have known each other for over an year. He asked his mom about me and she said she likes me but his dad and their community will never accept me as I'm not a Pataan (Pusto-speaking) like him. He asked his mom again after a month but got the same reply. We are very upset and he has broken off with me but I know he still wants to marry me. What should I do? How can we convince his parents? What should I do if they refuse again? Please help!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nUnfortunately the predicament you are in is common today because of our lack\nof understanding the mission and life of Rasoolullah Sallalahu Alaihi Was\nSallam. Nabi S.A.W came to unite the various tribes and people of different\nlanguages into one Ummah, however, it is rather sad if not distressing to\nnotice that the very Ummah of the Prophet S.A.W. today is reverting to the\nold practices of Jahiliyyah (period of ignorance). Our advice to you sister\nwill be to contact the Imam of your locality to either meet with the boy's\nfather or meet with the Imam of the boy's local Musjid and thus try and\nconvince the father of the boy that holding such traditions is against the\nShariah and could have serious repercussions. Also it should be your\npriority to make excessive Dua to Allah Ta'ala to open the heart of those\nopposing your marriage. Remember, Allah is the controller of hearts.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim D"
