  "question": "From what age should we encourage our daughters to wear hijaab?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMashaAllah we applaud you to be caring parents, concerned for the child's%0D%0Awell being. Islam is a beautiful \"way\" of life. Imaan is a great bounty to%0D%0Athe believer. Hence being a way of life a parent's beautiful example is more%0D%0Aeffective than merely lecturing, placing rules and enforcing the%0D%0Arequirements of deen.%0D%0A%0D%0ABy this we don't only mean wearing Hijaab but an exemplery beautiful%0D%0Acharacter in Hijaab. A wonderful kind loving mother fiqure plus father%0D%0Afiqure who becomes a friend and confidant of her offsprings that her%2Fhis%0D%0Aexample and advices will be become desirous to the child. Such a child will%0D%0Aeven in play and want to emulate her mother's hijaab when she leaves the%0D%0Ahousehold (or follow the father's desires of hijaab for her) is evident in%0D%0Amany children we see. Encouragenment and showing pleasure is an affirmation%0D%0Ato the child and becomes a natural attire when it becomes incumbet upon her%0D%0A(In other words she will need a beautiful role model in her life). In this%0D%0Away we have observed Allhumdulliah many young girls in our environmnent%0D%0Aadopting Hijaab including the veil even before adopting turning of age that%0D%0Ais becoming baalig. May Allah Ta'ala accept these youth and your efforts and%0D%0Ayour child too. Hence instill the beauty of Hijaab from an early age, Insha%0D%0AAllah when it is farz on her she w'ont find it a difficulty or rebel.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A2SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
