  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalamalaikoom, I visited a girl for potential marriage and ended up doing everything but sexual intercourse that included hugging, kissing, laying naked on the bed, oral sex. I am a virgin and was not involved with a female before and am still religious. Hugging and kissing itself was too much for me and so one thing led to another but alhumdolillah Allah saved me from intercourse. Do these acts fall under fornication? What is the punishment for fornication in hereafter? The muslimah though was intimately involved initially saying that she liked me now says she does not want to pursue any further with me; saying that there are many differences between us but she still likes me, she has had a bad past and is a revert. We met 3 days in person and talked on the phone for more than a month now. I am feeling very guilty and repenting, I am interested in teaching her more about islam and pursue the relationship further to a potential marriage that we may repent and follow islam closely, Will that wash mine and her sins, what should I do? it is difficult for her to understand the gravity of the sin that has been committed. I feel all my good deeds are in vain.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nEvery human being by nature is attracted to the opposite gender. Therefore,%0D%0AShariah has laid down the laws of hijaab, segregation of sexes, and%0D%0Aemphasised to adhere to the laws. Your personal experience should be%0D%0Asufficient to make you understand the wisdoms behind the laws of hijaab.%0D%0AAllah Taala says, And do not go near to adultery. In view of the above%0D%0Aquoted verse, apart from adultery being prohibited, any act that may lead to%0D%0Aadultery is also prohibited,for example, to be in isolation with a Ghair%0D%0AMahram (not prohibited in marriage) female, talking without need, kissing,%0D%0Ahugging, etc. Rasulullah (S.A.W) said, the two eyes also commit adultery and%0D%0Athat is by casting a lustful gaze at a women. In view of the aforegoing, you%0D%0Ahave committed a major sin for which tawba (repentance) is compulsory. One%0D%0Aof the conditions of tawba is also to make a firm intention never to repeat%0D%0Athe sin in the future. The month of Ramadaan is an ideal opportunity to%0D%0Achange and reform oneself. You should also discontinue every contact with%0D%0Athe girl and explain to her your reason of your future attitude.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
