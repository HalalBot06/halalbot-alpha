  "question": "2. Is it allowed to pray Qaza Namaz for Fajar and Asr immediately after one performs these Namaz ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Mufti Sahib, I saw a dog licking my elbow very thoroughly and then I get upset and wash my elbow with a lot of water so there is no more najs. 2. Is it allowed to pray Qaza Namaz for Fajar and Asr immediately after one performs these Namaz ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The dream is a reflection of you being sensitive to matters of Taharah (purification)\n\n2. Qadhaa Salaat may be performed after Asr Salaat until the glow of the sun remains. It is not permissible to perform Qadhaa Salaat at sunrise, midday, sunset and after the glow of the sun disappears after Asr.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
