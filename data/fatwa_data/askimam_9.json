  "question": "Is the wearing of a head covering required for men?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe US Air Force recently appointed it's first Muslim Chaplin and a photograph was taken of him in uniform at prayer. He was wearing a head covering and wears one while in uniform. Since members of the Jewish faith are required tokeep their heads covered, how can it be required by Islam? Is this just aninnovation?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA: Abu Kabsha (Radhiallaahu Ánhu) narrates that the hats of the companions of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to be round and spacious. (Mirqaat vol.8 pg.246)\n\nIt is narrated by Tabrani on the authority of Ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Ánhuma) that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to wear a white hat. (Ibid)\n\nHassan Basri (Rahmatullah Alayhi) states that the people (Sahaaba - Radhiallaahu Anhum) used to make Sajda (prostrate) upon their turbans and hats. (Bukhari vol.1 pg.56; Rashidiyya)\n\nIt is the only outward and unique salient feature that distinguishes a Muslim from a non-Muslim. No other community group or people wear the Muslim type hat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
