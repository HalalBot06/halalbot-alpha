In principle, it is permissible to sell an item with a cash price or credit price. The credit price could be higher than the cash price. It is a condition that in this instance, the deal must be concluded on either price, cash or credit. It is not permissible to sell an item with an open cash and credit price. In that instance, the surplus amount will be primarily in lieu of time and be regarded as interest.\n\n2. If the deal was concluded on $100, the seller is entitled to $100. The purchaser will have to pay $100 to the seller irrespective of the fluctuation in the dollar rate.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
