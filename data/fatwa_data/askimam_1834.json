  "question": "Marrige with Non-Muslim (idol worshipper).",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI did court marriage with a non-muslim girl as she didnt believe in idol worship and later did nikaah with her after she accepted islam. Now due to some reasons she started idol worship, can i continue with her?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIdol worship is Shirk (ascribing partners with Allah Ta'ala). The person in\nquestion has lost her Imaan upon committing Shirk and is no longer a Muslim.\nThe Nikaah has automatically terminated forthwith. You are no longer husband\nand wife and cannot live together.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best.\n\nMufti E. Desai"
