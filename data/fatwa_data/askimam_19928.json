Is this interest paying is Haram and how do I repent from it.\n\n2. I would like to purchase car for my necessary transportation due not having enough money I see many companies offering car on monthly installment basis but they charge extra money on installment more than the actual price of car on one time cash payment I dont know if this extra money is termed as Interest or complete price fixed at the time of deal. Please let me know if this is permissible to avail intallment option.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nYour first question is ambiguous.  Please re-submit the question with more clarity.  However, the general principle with regards to credit cards is that it is permissible to use them  if the payments are made timeously without defaulting.   \n\nIf the deferred price is higher than the spot price, then it will be permissible to purchase such a car on condition the price is agreed upon at the time of contracting the sale.[1]\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Faraz ibn Adam,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nLeicester, United Kingdom\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net\n\n\n\n[1] Introduction to Islamic Finance p.76-81"
