  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nafter how many talaaqs can a woman marry?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nA married woman can marry another man after any number of talaqs, one, two or three, irrespective of the talaqs being rajie (revocable) or baain (irrevocable) or mughallazah (permanently irrevocable). The marriage with another man is permissible after her iddat of divorce and only if the husband did not revoke the divorce during iddat in the case of talaq-e-rajie, whether one or two.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
