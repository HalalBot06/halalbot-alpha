  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan you give detailed information on Oaths and Vows?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nThe concept of oaths and vows seems to be very complicating and perplexing to many. The influx of questions posed to the Dārul Iftā’ with much confusion, misunderstanding, and at times frustration and regret is a clear reflection of this.\n\nAlhamdulillah, in the hope of clearing this blurriness and haze, the Dārul Iftā’ has conducted an extensive research on oaths and vows. The study is intended for the public and therefore, the in-depth technical issues relating to this topic was intentionally omitted facilitating it to be an easier, more understandable and pleasant read. We are hopeful that if a keen reader studies this document, it will provide a good overview of the subject and dispel the endless perplexity and misgivings of this topic, Inshallah.\n\n \n\nRead the complete Document here\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla knows best\n\n\n\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n\n\n\nDārul Iftā"
