  "question": "what does islam says about virginity of females ? Is hymen an indicator of virginity? how should a girl without an intact hymen yet a virgin proves her virginity to her husband ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have read in many medical magazines that in many cases the hymen breaks even when the girl is a virgin but in our culture and society a virgin should bleed on her wedding night and if she doesn't her husband will not believe on her virginity and she can get divorce or can even get killed , what should a virgin girl without an intact hymen do in such a situation ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn the Hadithn, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has encouraged a person\nto marry virgin women. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Marry\nvirgin women because they have sweeter mouths and more splitting wombs and\nare more pleased with little.' (Mishkaat pg.268)\n\nA woman's virginity could seize through means other than sexual relations,\nfor example, jumping, excessive bleeding during her menses, injury or even\nby the passage of time. However, according to the Shari'ah, in the above\nsituations, she would still be regarded or will still fall under the\ncategory of a virgin and the laws of virginity will be applicable to her.\n(Hidaaya part1 pg.315).\n\nNikah is a union based on trust and understanding. One should avoid\nunnecessary doubts and suspicions.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
