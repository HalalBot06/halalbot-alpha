Nabiصلي الله عليه و سلم said “Worship Allah as thou you see Allah, and if you can’t see Allah then know that Allah sees you.” (Bukhari) This is a good sign and a sign of Iman . The Sahaba رضي الله عنهم once said to Nabiصلي الله عليه و سلم, “Such thoughts come to our mind that we feel it difficult to even mention such thoughts”, Rasulullah صلي الله عليه و سلم said “Do you really get such thoughts?”, the Sahabah رضي الله عنهم said “Yes”, to this Nabi صلي الله عليه و سلمsaid “This is a clear sign of Iman.”(Muslim) However to imagine Allah having a shape or figure is impermissible. It is stated in the Holy Quran:  ليس كمثله شئ\n\n“Nothing is like him. (Allah)”\n\nTo imagine Almighty Allah in a form will not be correct, instead keep the thought that Allah Ta ‘ala is seeing you without you seeing Him. If these images in your mind persist, make Istigfaar.\n\nWhat could also help for your concentration is to take a few minutes after Fajr Salah and after Asr Salah and without disturbance ponder over the Aayat of the Quran in Surah Alaq:  ا لم يعلم بان الله يري\n\n“Does he not know that Allah is watching?”\n\n2.      You should consult a doctor and not arrive at your own conclusion. The doctor will tell you the cause of the bleeding. The cure of the bleeding will certainly not be masturbation.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nZakariyya Madatt,\n\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
