  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease, give me references that prohibits a person to keep legs towards Qibla. You have not given references i have to convince people who used to straighten their legs towards Allah(Qibla) in the most and ask for references. Jazak-Allah Aslam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala states in the noble Qur'aan, 'Whosoever respects Allah's signs,\nthat is the piety of the hearts.' (Quraan 22:32)\n\nThe Qiblah too is from amongst the signs of Allah Ta'ala. Respect is a\nrelative conduct which depends on the environment. In our environment,\nstretching one's legs towards the Qiblah is a sign of disrespect.\n\nThe above excludes stretching one's legs due to a valid excuse.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
