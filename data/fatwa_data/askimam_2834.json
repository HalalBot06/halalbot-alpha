  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualakum. Mufti Sahib, I was wondering if you could help me. I am a Hanafi and I was talking to a brother about an Islamic state. What should my opinion be regarding an Islamic state and what is the best way for it be instated?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nQ: Are Islamic laws applicable in a non-Muslim country?\nA: If the internal and external affairs of a country are run by a non-Muslim\ngovernment, and the government has not appointed a Muslim leader or judge\nfor its Muslim subjects, then it is incumbent upon the Muslims of that\ncountry to appoint a leader for themselves if they are free to practice\nIslam in that country. However till they do not unanimously decide on a\nleader, it is permissible for them to appoint a Muslim judge (or body), with\nwhom the people are pleased, to handle their affairs according to Shari√°h.\n(Iezaahun-nawaadir, p. 120)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
