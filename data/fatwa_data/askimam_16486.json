  "question": "It is not permissible to follow any experience which goes against Shariah.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI came to know from a person who spend 4 months tabligh jamath in north india that he saw in a masjid a list of 40 things / deeds which we should avoid,otherwise poverty will affect us. I noticed that after this, this person at any effort tries to avoid these matters. It includes presence of spider nest inside the home, answering to the nature's call in naked, etc....   Is this right? If yes, plz mention all those 40 points or atleast the maximum which you can point out so that the ummath can avoid these things\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nYou may obtain a copy of the article and send to us for our observations. However, there are many things that come to light with experience. It is possible that the forty points in the article are based on that. One may abstain from those things listed in the article on condition they are not against Shariah. It is not permissible to follow any experience which goes against Shariah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
