Thus, we witness numerous travesties and parodies coming from them in their attempts to twist, manipulate and totally abuse historical and etymological facts. These polemics range from a variety of the utterly hilarious to the outright abusive and cruel. One such dishonest Christian missionary polemic has been the allegation of the young marriage of `%C2ishah(R) to the Prophet Muhammad(P). The missionaries try to accuse the Prophet of being a child molester, albeit in politically correct terms, due to the fact that `%C2ishah(R) was betrothed (zawaj) at the age of 6 years old and the marriage was consummated (nik%E2h) a few years after the marriage at 9 years old when she was in full puberty. The lapse of time between the zawaj and nik%E2h of `%C2ishah(R) clearly shows that her parents were waiting for her to reach puberty before her marriage was consummated. If it were not for the fact that some gullible Christians have been parroting the claims without understanding the reasons behind it, we would have not even bothered with a refutation. Such a claim is based only on conjecture and moral relativism, and not on fact. This article seeks to refute the allegation, insha'allah.%0D%0A%0D%0APuberty And Young Marriage In Semitic Culture%0D%0A-------------%0D%0AThe hilarity of the whole saga of Christian missionaries accusing the Prophet(P) of committing \"child molestation\" is that this contradicts the basic fact that a girl becomes a woman when she begins her menstruation cycle. The significance of menstruation that anyone with the slightest familiarity with physiology will tell you is that it is a sign that the girl is being prepared to become a mother.%0D%0A%0D%0AWomen reach puberty at different ages ranging from 8-12 years old depending on genetics, race and environment. We read that%0D%0A%0D%0AThere is little difference in the size of boys and girls until the age of ten, the growth spurt at puberty starts earlier in girls but lasts longer in boys.[1] %0D%0A%0D%0AWe also read that%0D%0A%0D%0AThe first signs of puberty occur around age 9 or 10 in girls but closer to 12 in boys[.][2]%0D%0A%0D%0AWomen in warmer environments reach puberty at a much earlier age than those in cold environments.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe average temperature of the country or province is considered the chief factor here, not only with regard to menstruation but as regards the whole of sexual development at puberty.[3]%0D%0A%0D%0AMarriage at the early years of puberty was acceptable in 7th century Arabia as it was the social norm in all Semitic cultures from the Israelites to the Arabs and all nations in between. According to H%E2-Talm%FBd H%E2-Bavl%EE, which the Jews regard as their \"oral Torah\", Sanhedrin 76b clearly states that it is preferable that a woman be married when she has her first menses, and in Ketuvot 6a there are rules regarding sexual intercourse with girls who have not yet menstruated. This is further collaborated when Jim West, ThD, a Baptist minister, observes the following tradition of the Israelites:%0D%0A%0D%0AThe wife was to be taken from within the larger family circle (usually at the outset of puberty or around the age of 13) in order to maintain the purity of the family line.[4]%0D%0A%0D%0APuberty has always been a symbol of adulthood throughout history.%0D%0A%0D%0APuberty is defined as the age or period at which a person is first capable of sexual reproduction, in other eras of history, a rite or celebration of this landmark event was a part of the culture.[5]%0D%0A%0D%0AThe renowned sexologists, R.E.L. Masters and Allan Edwards, in their study of Afro-Asian sexual expression states the following%0D%0A%0D%0AToday, in many parts of North Africa, Arabia, and India, girls are wedded and bedded between the ages of five and nine; and no self-respecting female remains unmarried beyond the age of puberty.[6] %0D%0A%0D%0AWere There Any Objections to the Marriage of the Prophet(P) to `%C2ishah(R)? %0D%0A----------------%0D%0AThe answer to this is no. There are absolutely no records from Muslim, secular, or any other historical sources which even implicitly display anything other than utter joy from all parties involved over this marriage. Nabia Abbott describes the marriage of `%C2ishah(R) to the Prophet(P) as follows.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn no version is there any comment made on the disparity of the ages between Mohammed and Aishah or on the tender age of the bride who, at the most, could not have been over ten years old and who was still much enamoured with her play.[7] %0D%0A%0D%0AEven the well-known critical Orientalist, W. Montgomery Watt, said the following about the Prophet's moral character:%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the standpoint of Muhammad's time, then, the allegations of treachery and sensuality cannot be maintained. His contemporaries did not find him morally defective in any way. On the contrary, some of the acts criticized by the modern Westerner show that Muhammad's standards were higher than those of his time.[8]%0D%0A%0D%0AAside from the fact that no one was displeased with him or his actions, he was a paramount example of moral character in his society and time. Therefore, to judge the Prophet's morality based on the standards of our society and culture today is not only absurd, but also unfair.%0D%0A%0D%0AMarriage At Puberty Today%0D%0A-----------------%0D%0AThe Prophet's contemporaries (both enemies and friends) clearly accepted the Prophet's marriage to `%C2ishah(R) without any problem. We see the evidence for this by the lack of criticism against the marriage until modern times. However, a change in culture has caused the change in our times today.%0D%0A%0D%0AEven today in the 21st century, the age of sexual consent is still quite low in many places. In Japan, people can legally have sex at age 13, and in Spain they can legally have sex at the age of 12 years old[9]. %0D%0A%0D%0AA 40-year-old man having sex with a 14-year-old woman may be a \"paedophile\" in the United States, but neither in China today, where the age of consent is 14, nor in the United States in the last century. Biology is a much better standard by which to determine these things, not the arbitrariness of human culture. In the U.S. during the last century, the age of consent was 10 years old. California was the first state to change the age of consent to 14, which it did in 1889. After California, other U.S. states joined in and raised the age of consent too[10].%0D%0A%0D%0AIslam And the Age of Puberty%0D%0A------------------%0D%0AIslam clearly teaches that adulthood starts when a person have attained puberty.%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the collection of Bukhari[11], we read the following tracts:%0D%0A%0D%0AThe boy attaining the age of puberty and the validity of their witness and the Statement of All%E2h: %0D%0A%0D%0A\"And when the children among you attain the age of puberty, then let them also ask for permission (to enter).\" Qur'%E2n 24:59.%0D%0A%0D%0AAl Mughira said, \"I attained puberty at the age of twelve.\" The attaining of puberty by women is with the start of menses, as is referred to by the Statement of All%E2h:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"Such of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them prescribed period if you have any doubts (about their periods) is three months...\" [Qur'%E2n, 65:4]%0D%0A%0D%0AThus, it is part of Islam to acknowledge the coming of puberty as the start of adulthood. It is the time when the person has already matured and is ready the responsibilities of an adult. So on what basis do the missionaries criticize the marriage of `%C2ishah(R) since her marriage was consummated when she had reached puberty?%0D%0A%0D%0AWe also read from the same source that%0D%0A%0D%0A...Al-Hasan bin Salih said, \"I saw a neighbour of mine who became a grandmother at the age of twenty-one.\"(1) %0D%0A%0D%0A(1) The note for this reference says: \"This women attained puberty at the age of nine and married to give birth to a daughter at ten; the daughter had the same experience.\"[12]%0D%0A%0D%0AThus, it is clear that if the charge of \"child molestation\" were to be advanced against the Prophet(P), we would also have to include all the Semitic people who accepted marriage at puberty as the norm.%0D%0A%0D%0AConclusions%0D%0A------------------%0D%0AWe have thus seen that%0D%0A%0D%0AIt was the norm of the Semitic society in 7th century Arabia to allow pubescent marriages.%0D%0A%0D%0AThere was no reports of opposition to the Prophet's marriage to `%C2ishah(R) either from his friends or his enemies.%0D%0A%0D%0AEven today, there are cultures who still allow pubescent marriage for their young women.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn spite of facing these well-known facts, the missionaries would still have the audacity to point a finger at the Prophet Muhammad(P) for immorality. Yet, it was he who had brought justice to the women of Arabia and raised them to a level they had not seen before in their society, something which ancient civilizations have never done to their women.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen Muhammad(P) first became the Prophet of Islam, the pagans of Arabia had inherited a disregard for women as had been passed down among their Jewish and Christian neighbours. So disgraceful was it considered among them to be blessed with a female child that they would go so far as to bury this baby alive in order to avoid the disgrace associated with female children.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"When news is brought to one of them of (the birth of) a female (child) his face darkens and he is filled with inward grief! With shame does he hide himself from his people because of the bad news he has had! Shall he retain it on (sufferance and) contempt or bury it in the dust? Ah! what an evil (choice) they decide on!\"[13] %0D%0A%0D%0AThrough the teachings of Islam, Muhammad(P) put a swift and resounding end to this evil practice. God tells us that on the Day of Judgment, the female child will be questioned for what crime she was killed.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"When the female (infant) buried alive is questioned - for what crime she was killed.\"[14]%0D%0A%0D%0ANot only did Muhammad(P) severely discouraged and condemned this act, he(P) also used to teach them to respect and cherish their daughters and mothers as partners and sources of salvation for the men of their family.%0D%0A%0D%0AAbu Sa'id al-Khudri narrated that%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Prophet(P) said: 'If anyone cares for three daughters, disciplines them, marries them, and does good by them, he will enter Paradise.'[15] %0D%0A%0D%0AAbdullah the son of Abbas narrated that%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Prophet(P) said: 'If anyone has a female child, and does not bury her alive, or slight her, or prefer his male children over her, All%E2h will bring him into Paradise.'[16] %0D%0A%0D%0AThe Prophet(P) is also cited in Saheeh Muslim as saying%0D%0A%0D%0A'Whoever maintains two girls till they attain maturity, he and I will come on the Day of Resurrection like this'; and he joined his fingers.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn other words, if one loves the Messenger of God(P) and wishes to be with him on the day of resurrection in heaven, then they should do good by their daughters. This is certainly not the act of a \"child molester\", as the missionaries would like us to believe.%0D%0A%0D%0AFinally, we end this with a citation from the Holy Prophet(P), who said%0D%0A%0D%0A\"I have come to defend the two oppressed peoples: women and orphans.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Prophet Muhammad(P)%0D%0A%0D%0AAppendix: A married nine-year old in Thailand gives birth%0D%0A%0D%0AA news article from The New Straits Times, Malaysia dated 10th of March, 2001 about a nine-year old girl living in northern Thailand giving birth to a baby girl. The fact that a nine-year old girl is mature enough to give birth proves the point above about girls reaching puberty earlier than men.%0D%0A%0D%0AMohd Elfie Nieshaem Juferi"
