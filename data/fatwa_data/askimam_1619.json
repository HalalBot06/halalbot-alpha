  "question": "Will the enhanced bleeding be regarded as Haydh?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDuring menopause generally a female?s monthly cycle of bleeding is suppressed resulting in her experiencing hot flushes and other medical complications. Her physician prescribes HRT (hormone replacement tablets) in order to enhance her monthly cycle which gives her relief.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe enhanced bleeding by HRT (hormone replacement tablets) will be regarded as Haydh. (Shaami vol.1 pg.222; Rashidiyya)\n\nThe same ruling applies for a female who attained the age of despair (Sinne-Iyaas) of 50 years. During Haydh (menstruation), a female cannot perform Salaat, fast, recite and touch the Noble Qur?aan and make Tawaaf."
