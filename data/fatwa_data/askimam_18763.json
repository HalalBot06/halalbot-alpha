  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI understand from my reading of Islamic texts that sleeping on your stomach is discouraged. Its supposed to better to sleep on\n\nyour right side or your back.\n\nCan you tell me why this is?\n\nMy habit since childhood has been to sleep on my stomach and now I am trying to change this, but its\n\nbeen very difficult. Can you tell me how important this is to rectify?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nThe reason why it is discouraged for one to lay on his/her stomach is due to the following hadith of the Prophet (SallAllāhu ῾Alayhi Wasallam):\n\n“The Prophet (SallAllāhu ῾Alayhī Wassallam) saw a person sleeping on his stomach in the masjid. So he told the person, ‘For indeed Allah T῾āla does not like that one sleeps in this position.’”\n\n(Jām῾i al-Tirmidhī, Vol. 2, Pg. 105,)[1]\n\n\n\nThe above mentioned hadith clearly mentions that for one to lie on his/her stomach is disliked by Allah T῾āla, therefore, one should abstain from doing so.\n\nWe are pleased to hear that you are making effort to get rid of this bad habit. We advise that you lay on your right side in the sunnah manner as long as possible for you. This will enable you to gradually leave the habit of sleeping on your stomach. Also, we advise that, along with continuing to do your full best to overcome this bad habit, you make dua that Allah T῾āla makes it easy for you to rectify this habit.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\nMl. Sajid bin Shabbir,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā\n\n\n\n\n[1]   عن أبي هريرة قال رأى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم رجلا مضطجعا على بطنه فقال إن هذه ضجعة لا يحبها الله (أبواب الإستيذان والأدب عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، باب ما جاء في كراهية الإضطجاع على البطن)"
