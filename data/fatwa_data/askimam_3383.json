Your journey of purification needs to start with five times of Salaat following this with Sunnah Azkaa after Salaat, e.g. the recitation of Tasbeeh Faatima, Aayatul Kursi, 3 times Astaghfirullah, also Laa Ilaaha illallaahu Wahdahu Laa Shareeka lahu. Lahul Mulk Walahul Hamd Yuhyee Wa Yumeet Wahuwa ?alaa kulli shay-in Qadeer 10 times.\n\nYou also need to earn the Halaal way and eat that which is Halaal. Give charity and strive in the path of Allah Ta?ala. Insha Allah, you would come closer to Allah, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
