  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease can you tell if when doing nafl fasts you can keep them for more than one intention.  for example if i am replacing my fasts that I have missed from the last ramzaan can I also ask that the sawaab be given to a deceased family member?  Also when intending to do something such as reading the quran or giving sadaqa on begalf of the deceased is there anything in particular that should be said?  Jazak Allah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIn principle, a person can convey the reward of any charitable or physical deed that is Nafil (voluntary) with more than one intention. However, Qadhaa’ fasts (missed fasts) are not regarded as Nafil. Therefore, you can not make eesaal e sawab with that.\n\nThere is no specific procedure of making Eesaal e Sawab to others. Simply make the intention that whatever good deeds you are offering, their reward be conveyed to the deceased.\n\n(Aap kay Masail, Pg.227, Vol.3, Maktabah Ludhyanwy)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl. Abdur Rahman Shareef,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nConcured by: Ml. Abduz Zaman, Student Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nUnder the guidance of:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai Saheb\nDārul Iftā"
