  "question": "If a wife has been given one divorce before consummation of marriage, can they reconcile, or do they need remarry?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalaam Alaikum Brother, I have a question regarding my marriage which I want to ask. Since I got married, I have been suffering from waswaas of divorcing my wife, it was so bad that I found my self repeting the words in my head, though I tried hard to pray duas/surahs. I fear that I may have divorced her by giving her one divorce, before consummation of marriage, though there was company and privacy between us. Now having read up on this, there is no iddah period for the wife before consummation of marriage. Would I be able to take her back though the normal method or will I need to through nikah to get a new marriage contract? Thank you and I look forward to your responce.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf one has Waswasa (doubt) of giving his wife divorce, that does not\nconstitute a divorce. Your Nikah is intact and there is no need for you to\nrenew your Nikah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
