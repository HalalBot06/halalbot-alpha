The husband and wife should consider each others feelings and accordingly resolve the frequency of the visits. At times certain happenings do occur which requires the couple to visit the in laws more often. Therefore, this is an issue of mutual resolve and understanding. The husband should consider this issue in a manner that will enhance the love and understanding of the couple and bear in mind the best interest of the relationship. He should apply wisdom and diplomacy in making his decision, as lack of wisdom and diplomacy could jeopardize the marriage.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam"
