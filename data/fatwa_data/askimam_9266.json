  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) Is it allowed for a Muslim male to write the name of my wife on my Hand which will be permanent on my skin. 2) I can read and write arabic language but cannot understand because I am from India but now here my saudi friend telling me as a Muslim I must know the arabic Language like Arabian Country peoples. according to Islam & Quran please give me the proof & details and also what abt those peoples who were born in Non-Arab Countries but they are muslims they can only read the Quran. 3) I heard that after death every muslim will know the arabic language and angles will ask the questions in Arabic only. Kindly pleaes clarify my dout.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) prohibited the act of tattooing which is marking the skin by puncturing it. The permanent insertion of your wife?s name in your skin will be through tattooing which is prohibited.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Every Muslim must be able to read the Qur?aan and also memorise some portions of the Qur?aan to recite in Salaat. It is advisable to learn Arabic as a language in order to have a better understanding of the Shari?ah. However, it is also important to point out that merely knowing Arabic language is not sufficient to understand the Shari?ah. It is similar to knowing English but that is not sufficient for one to have an understanding in everything, medicine, science, chemistry, engineering, law, etc. through English text books. Every subject has its rules and principles and must be understood contextually. Similarly, the Qur?aan and Hadith must be understood by its rules and principles and not by merely knowing Arabic. %0D%0A%0D%0A3. It is also true that the language of the dwellers Jannah will be Arabic irrespective of them not knowing Arabic in this world.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
