  "question": "what steps would the woman has to take to purify herself when participating in such an act given that there has been no form",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nMy first question is a) would stimulating and sucking wife’s breasts whilst she is not lactating and the consequential white viscous discharge from penis due to excitement necessitate Ghusl or any other form of purification to allow me to pray. Does the quantity of discharge have any bearing on the type of purification?\n\n \n\nBy the same token  b) what steps would the woman has to take to purify herself when participating in such an act given that there has been no form of direct vaginal penetration either by hand or penis?\n\n \n\nI would also like to know the purification process both for men and women following the below mentioned acts.\n\n \n\nc.         Vaginal/Penis stimulation with the clothes on and where the women/man has not climaxed/ejaculated.\n\n \n\nd.         Inserting fingers into Vagina which has not caused an orgasm.  \n\n \n\ne.         A French kiss.\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram Brother in Islam\n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\nA.) In principle, there are three types of liquids that emit the private part. 1) Mazi is emitted when ones passion is aroused. The liquid is colourless and invalidates the Wudhu only. 2). Mani is the fluid which is emitted by the private part upon reaching climax. This is white in colour and invalids the Ghusal. 3). Wadi is that colourless liquid that appears due to illness and sometimes follows Mani. Wadi will invalidate the Wudhu only.\n\nB.) If a woman has discharged any liquid, her Wudhu will also be nullified. If the discharge has soiled the undergarment, it has to be changed or washed.\n\nC.) If there was any discharge due to excitement or fondling, only Wudhu will become invalid.\n\nD.) If the finger was inserted and the private part was moist, Wudhu will become invalid. If climax was reached Ghusal will become necessary.\n\nE.) If no liquid was discharged when kissing, neither the Wudhu nor the Ghusal will be invalidated.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai\n\nStudent: Darul Ifta\n\nChecked and Approved\n\nMoulana Emraan Vawda"
