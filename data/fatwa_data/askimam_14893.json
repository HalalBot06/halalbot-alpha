  "question": "Is it permissible for a couple to have sex under the open sky (obviously in total privacy)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. Most people agree that for a wife to perform oral sex on a husband is haraam. But there is mixed views on the husband performing oral sex on a wife. Is it permissible or not?\n\n2. Is it permissible for a couple to have sex under the open sky (obviously in total privacy)?\n\n3. Can someone perform sex in a room were you can see the sky outside? I have been told that you cannot have sex were you have a view of the sky.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n \n\nShariah has emphasized on shame and modesty. Intercourse is a natural demand of a human being. However, that should be fulfilled in a modest way. Consider the following Ahadith on shame and modesty:\n\nحدثنا أبو مسعود عقبة قال قال النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم إن مما أدرك الناس من كلام النبوة إذا لم تستحي فافعل ما شئت( رواه البخاري) \n\nNabi (sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) says: ‘If you have no shame do what you want’.\n\n\nعن أبي هريرة قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم الحياء من الإيمان والإيمان في الجنة والبذاء من الجفاء والجفاء في النار(رواه الترمذي)\n\nNabi (sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) says: ‘Modesty is from Iman, and Iman leads you to Jannah. Obscenity is from futile things, and futile things lead you to Jahannam.\n\n\nسمعت أبا الدرداء ، يقول : قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : « إن أثقل شيء في الميزان يوم القيامة حسن الخلق (رواه التزمذي)\n\nNabi (sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) says: ‘the action that will give the heaviest on the scale on the day of resurrection is good character’\n\n(Mishkatul Masabeeh  Pg: 431 (Qadeemi Kutub Khana))\n\n \n\nFurthermore, the Fuqaha have ruled that oral sex Makruh Tahrimi(close to haraam), since there is a strong possibility that by ejaculation, semen comes out and enters the mouth of the partner. Even if precaution is taken in avoiding the impurity, it is not necessary that every pure thing can be taken into the mouth. For example, although mucus is pure, no one takes it to the mouth.\n\nMoreover, Islam forbids one from using his right hand for cleansing oneself in the toilet because the right hand is used in more virtuous things; then one can imagine the extent of undesirability in using the mouth in such places, when the mouth is used for Zikr, reading of Quran, etc.\n\nThe ruling of oral sex is the same, whether it is performed on the husband or the wife. (Fataawa Raheemiyah Vol:10 Pg:178)\n\nAs far as having sex under the sky is concerned, there is no particular restriction regarding it in shariah. However, it would not be preferable to do so, as it is against modesty and reflects immorality, and the importance of modesty is clear from above.\n\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n\nWassalam\n\n\nMl.
