  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have received a big amount of money as a gift on my wedding from my father?s friend, and I have doubts on the source of this man?s money, it might be from haraam source. What should I do with this money, shall I give it to someone or it is ok for me to keep and use?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, if a person?s major source of income is Halaal, then it is permissible to accept a gift from such a person. If the major source of income is Haraam, then it is not permissible to accept a gift from such a person.\n\nHowever, if one is certain about the source of the actual gift being Halaal or Haraam, then the ruling will be accordingly irrespective of the abovementioned principle. Therefore, if your father?s friend?s major source of income is Halaal, then you may accept his gift as you are not sure of the actual source of the gift.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
