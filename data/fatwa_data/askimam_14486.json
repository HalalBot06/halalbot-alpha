  "question": "Making up Ramadan and a Question about Sadaqah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMaking up Ramadan and a Question about Sadaqah\n\nI missed quite a few days last Ramadan due to pregnancy and I know I have to make them up or feed a certain number of miskin for the amount of days I didn't fast. And Since I've been nursing a baby now, it's been rather difficult to make the missed days by fasting. Therefore... 1.If I have been using my wealth to help feed my husband's children from a previous marriage, will this go towards making up missed fasting days during Ramadan? He has 4 children and I've been contributing 50% - 60% of my wealth every month for 10 months for 1 child and 4 months for the remaining 3 children. My income during the first 10 months was $152 and went up $278 for the last 3 months. 2.Is sadaqah from one person to a second person considered the wealth of the second person? May Allah SWT reward you and your staff greatly for the wealth of knowledge you provide all of us miskin\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt was permissible for you not to fast during Ramadhaan due to pregnancy. It is, however, compulsory for you to make up for your missed fasts. You cannot feed poor people in lieu of the missed fasts. That is only if you are unable to permanently fast. If you cannot fast now, you could delay the Qadhaa for the next ideal opportune moment.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
