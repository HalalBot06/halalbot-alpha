  "question": "I would like to marry a divorced Christian woman with 1 child. Is it possible, she will accept Islam.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a single man and would like to marry a divorced Christian woman with 1 child. My parents will not agree. She will accept Islam as well as the child. Is there anything wrong with this? Is there any way of making my parents understand. Will this work out ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFrom a Shar'ee perspective, there is absolutely nothing wrong in marrying%0D%0Aher after she accepts Islam. You mention that there is a 'possibility' of%0D%0Aher accepting Islam. From experience, we find that in many a case wherein%0D%0Aone of the prospective parties is a non-Muslim and the other a Muslim, the%0D%0Anon-Muslim partner accepts Islam just for the convenience of marriage and%0D%0Athereafter all is lost and he or she reverts to their old ways and culture.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Christian culture is very different to that of Islam, hence, these are%0D%0Afactors to be considered. This is our general finding in instances such as%0D%0Ayours, however, in some very few cases, Islam is chosen and accepted with%0D%0Asincerity and not for the convenience of Nikah. Thus, we advise you to%0D%0Acarefully ponder over your future and not to be blinded by such superficial%0D%0Alove. An Arabic adage goes, 'Your love for something or someone causes you%0D%0Ato become blind (from the long term consequences of a rash decision taken%0D%0Aout of love) and deaf (from the advice of your elders and wellwishers).%0D%0A%0D%0AMay we also advise you to make of Istikhaara and seek divine guidance in%0D%0Ayour situation.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
