  "question": "Is it acceptable for a hijaab observing sister to show herself once to a brother who has proposed and is happy generally with her but want's to be sure he is happy with her facial appearance",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Is it acceptable for a hijaab observing sister to show herself once to a brother who has proposed and is happy generally with her but want's to be sure he is happy with her facial appearance/beauty so that he knows he will be attracted to her?\n\n2. One of the four recommendations by Rasool Allah for looking in a wife is beauty and to my understanding physical attraction is considered an important factor when one looks for a marraige partner. Is my understanding here correct?\n\n3. What is the correct way for a brother or sister to determine or sincerely investigate physical/facial (beauty) attraction in the potential marraige partner during proposal, how much can the female show to see if the proposing brother accepts her physical/facial beauty and how much can a male show to the sister for the same reason? What other rules/conditions apply here?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. It is, in fact, encouraged for the boy and girl to see one another before proposing for marriage. It is a risk to first propose and then see one another. If the boy and/or girl is not attracted to each other, then he/she may regret the proposal. The situation could be worse if the proposal is accepted.\n\n2. Your understanding is correct. However, physical attraction is not the foremost important factor. Piety is.\n\n3. The boy and girl may see the face of each other and at most the outer appearance of each other for purposes of marriage.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
