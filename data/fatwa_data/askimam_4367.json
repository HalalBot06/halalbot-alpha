  "question": "Asalaam -u-Aluykum Mufti Saheb I would like to know why is it that we pray Fajr, Maghrib and Isha loud, and Zohar and Asr quietly?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nEvery act of Salaah is an act of Ta'abuadi (expression of slavery and\nsubjugation). We submit to such acts simply because it is the order of Allah\nand not due to any wisdom behind the order as the wisdoms may not be\ncomprehended by our limited understanding. The audible and inaudible aspect\nof qiraat in different salaats is similar to the number of rakaats in the\ndifferent salaats, the times for salaat, and performing wudhu by washing\nspecific limbs, etc. Submission to such acts is an expression of subjugation\nto the orders of Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
