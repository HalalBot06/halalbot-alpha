  "question": "Are they allowed to make plastic bags for the lottery company?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThere is a plastic company that has received an order from a lottery company to produce plastic bags. Are they allowed to make plastic bags for the lottery company?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nSince producing the plastic bags for the lottery company entails both indirectly assisting evil and vice as well as being paid with money that one has established to be Haraam, it will not be permissible to accept such an order.
