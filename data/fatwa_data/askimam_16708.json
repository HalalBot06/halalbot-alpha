  "question": "Do i have to perform Ghusl if i get an erection without doing intercourse?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question is whenever I have an erection (without sexual intercourse). Once it goes back to normal I can feel and see wetness on my pants (underwear). at this time am I unpure, and need to do Ghusal. (clean Myself)\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThere are three types of fluids that emit from the private parts besides urine.\n\n1. Mani-Sperm: A white thick fluid which emits at the time of mans desire being fulfilled. This necessitates a bath.\n\n2. Mazi-Pre-coital fluid: A clear thin fluid which emits due to sexual arousal. This necessitates wudhu.\n\n3. Wadi-Liquid that precedes urine: This necessitates wudhu.(Bahishti Zewar Pg .79)\n\nThe fluid visible on your clothing was discharged due to sexual arousal.Â  This does not necessitate a bath but the soiled area should be washed and squeezed three times.(Noorul idaah Pg. 38. Qadimi Kutub Khaanah)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Ebrahim Desai,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
