  "answer": "QUESTION\nbut I have seemed to have lost the thirst for knowledge, I used to read lots before, but now I cannot even sit down for a moment to learn denni ilm, I read little quarn at the moment, but my concentration elapses after 15mins or so. At the moment I listen to a lot of audio lectures (M. Yunus Patel, Your jummah lecture etc from the internet etc).I know the dua (rabbi zidne ilma), how often do I have to read this dua, (quite often, when making supplication etc) is their any other dua you can give me and some practical advice, so I can gain the thirst for denni knowledge again, so I can make amal on the knowledge I acquire, and make my intention pure only to please Allah, Zarkarkallah, for your time, remember me in your dua\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe observe that you do have the thirst for knowledge as you have sacrificed and taken out your valuable time to pose your question through this site inspite of its limited quota. You also listen to lots of audio cassettes. You also enquire about the du?aa to increase your knowledge.\n\nYou probably have difficult in reading. We are unable to understand the reason for that. That, however, does not mean you lost your thirst for knowledge. We advise you assess your past situation and present situation to find out the actual reason of your lack of interest in reading. Until then, we advise you continue seeking knowledge through the audio cassettes and practise on whatever you learn.\n\nMay Allah Ta?ala grant you beneficial knowledge, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
