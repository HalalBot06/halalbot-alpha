  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nam doing Bacheolars in Information Technology and I am going very good in that but my passion is to get some job in the Finance sector like bank. Banking job seems to be an ideal for me becase of the life style, social life, executive level posts and high salaries whereas in computing you don't have much of the social life. I am also planning to do Masters in Finance and adopt it as a career.\n\nBut being as a muslim I have to choose for myself right or wrong. Lot of people told me that Banking salary is haram because they deal with the interests and you may know better then me that what is happening in the banking industry today.It is just silly to say that certain certain bank is dealing without interest and one you are entered in the field you have to do all the work to gain some promotion in that. you can' just stick to one type of work.\n\nMy age is 20 now and I have any option to choose for my life. Thats why before practically entering into the field and reaching the age at what you are not able to change your profession I just want to confirm from you that either that earning is HALAL or not. Because at the moment I have the choice. I want to earn Halal rizq for me and for my family.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYou are faced with a choice between Shari’ah Compliance and worldly benefits. You state the benefits and privileges in the Banking sector is more than the IT sector. The biggest concern in the banking sector is the interest factor especially if you intend working in a conventional bank. You will be engaged in interest bearing deals all the time unless you join an Islamic bank.\n\nHowever, the opportunities in an Islamic bank are limited. You may also discuss that possibility with your local Ulama and if there is an Islamic bank in Australia, you could consier studying conventional banking as well as Islamic banking and contribute to Islamic banking. If that is not possible, then remain in the IT sector. Shari’ah compliance in your work and income should prevail over worldly benefits.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
