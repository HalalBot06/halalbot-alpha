  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it true that there are seven worlds like the one we live in? And do humans like us live there? Do they have ambiyaa as well?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIn the first verse of Sura Fatiha, Allah Taala says, “All praises is due to Allah Rabbul Aalameen”. Allah refers Himself as Rabbul Aalameen (the Lord of the Worlds).\n\nIt is understood from this word, Aalameen meaning world, that there is more than one world. The verse does not say how many worlds there are. However in another verse, Allah says, “Allah is He who created seven skies and likewise the earth.\n\nIt is understood from the Ahadith that Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) met different prophets at different skies during the incident of Meraj. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
