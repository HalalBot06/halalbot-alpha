Being conceptualised by man and based on traditions and myths that are\nman made, it cannot be used to make a judgement that people born under the\nsame sign share the same or similar characteristics.\nZodiacal signs being the tools of fortune-tellers and soothsayers rules out\nthe use of these signs as stated in a Hadith \"Whoever goes to a\nfortuneteller or soothsayer and believes in what he says then he has\ndisbelived in what has been revealed to Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam).
