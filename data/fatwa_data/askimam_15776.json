  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nregarding pictures in islam, it is known that pictures of animate objects possessing a soul are haraam. but what about when the picture is of a human being but the picture is taken from the back. a picture of a man or woman (or animal for that matter) taken from behind the person/animal showing the entire body including the head, without the face being shown. would this picture be acceptable in islam, or would it be considered haraam also.\nwas salaam\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is not permissible to take a picture of a human being from the back. The issue of prohibition is not restricted to the face but the whole body including the head, back etc. The only exception the jurists give is when a picture is taken without the head as it is impossible to have a human without a head. Pictures of a human being without the eyes on the face is also prohibited (Tahtaawi page 362).\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nÂ \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
