  "question": "I wish to repay a person for damage caused to his property some while back, but the person is no longer contactable. How should I relieve myself of this obligation?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn ignorance, I caused some small damage to a persons car and did not tell him about it. I did take his registration down. But his registration has changed (T to GP) and now that I want to relieve myself of the burden, I cannot do so because the person cannot be contacted or found. What should I do? Someone told me I should give out the estimated damages as charity and ask Allah to bestow this wealth to the person, and Allah to put it in his heart to forgive me. Please advise on how to absolve myself of this responsibility.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe advice given to you by the person to give the estimated amount of damages in Sadaqah is correct.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
