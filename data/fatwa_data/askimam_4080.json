  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSince you are in the United States, we assume your question relates to the%0D%0ASeptember 11 attacks.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf so, kindly find below is our standard response.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AJIHAAD AND THE PLANE CRASHING IN NEW YORK%0D%0A%0D%0AAccording to the Shari?ah, in normal conditions, when there is no declaration of Jihaad, Muslims are required to conduct themselves in a dignified and honourable way. Their sound character and conduct should leave an impression in the hearts of non-Muslims that Islam is a religion of submission and subjugation to the orders of Allah Ta?ala which invokes the peace of Allah Ta?ala on earth. Thus, Islam is a religion of peace and is against any act that impedes peace.%0D%0A%0D%0AEven, when there is a declaration of Jihaad (by competent and reliable Ulama, after having studied the situation and substantiating the need for Jihaad with Shar?ee reasons), it is prohibited to target and kill women, children and old people. Hadhrat ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to advise the army before dispatching them, ?Do not deceive, do not disfigure, do not kill children and those in churches.? (I?elaa-us-Sunan vol.12 pg.31; Idaratul Qur?aan)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is clear from the aforegoing narration that the flight bombing of the twin towers of the World Trade Centre, New York and the Pentagon has no basis in Islamic Shari?ah. Therefore, as Muslims, we are required to adhere to the laws of the Shari?ah.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf Muslims perceive any injustices to them, they should create suitable channels and avenues to address such issues. If they are unsuccessful in their endervours, they should make Mashwara (consult) with the Fuqahaa (intelligent) and Aabideen (pious) people on the best course of action. It is against the spirit of Islam to make independent decisions as that may be dangerous to the course of Islam.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0ADarul Ifta - Madrasah In?aamiyyah, Camperdown"
