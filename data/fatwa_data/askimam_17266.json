  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalamu Alaikum\n  \nI have a question regarding an error in the prayer (on 27 Ramadan 1429), after Taravi of 20 rakats, we were about to pray 3 Rakats Witr & Imam Sahib felt little ill & he decided to rest & asked some one to come forward for the Imamat. Imam Sahib was in Ahtikaf so he went to Ahtikaf room for the rest. In the meantime when Jamat finished 3 rakats of witr. a person who prayed 8 Rakats of Taravi was in the Ahtikaf room (but was not a part of Ahtikaf) came in & reported an error in the Namaz told that Imam sahib second has forgoten some verses in Alhamdu Sharief but no one in the Jamat reported an error, Imam sahib first also told that there was an error.\n \nSo there took a lot of controversy & resulted in quarrelling between some peoples. so i am writing to your goodself to kindly look in this & kindly tell us about our Witr, was it performed or not.\n \n \nThanks & Regards\n \n \nMohammad Sarfaraz\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nDid you read the witr Salah behind the second Imam?\n\nHow did the second Imam recite surah Fatiha?\n\nWhy do you say that the imam first said there was an error?\n\nWhat did he say later?\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\nWassalam\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa, Madrassah In'aamiyyah"
