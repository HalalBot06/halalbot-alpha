  "question": "If I said, \"Stupid\" regarding the way Allah has set things out for me (i.e. testing me through adverse conditions which I'm getting really tired of now) and it shouldn’t be happening because I can’t cope with them",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nOnce, my efforts went to waste and I got really annoyed by it. In a state of anger and despondency, I said \"Stupid\". I now can't remember the exact reason for saying the word. It may one of the following and which of the following makes me a kaafir?\n\n \n\n1.      If I said, \"Stupid\" meaning Allah is (Allah forbid).\n\n2.      If I said, \"Stupid\" regarding the way Allah has set things out for me (i.e. testing me through adverse conditions which I'm getting really tired of now) and it shouldn’t be happening because I can’t cope with them\n\n \n\n3.      If I said \"stupid\" meaning that these events are really annoying and causing a problem.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.      Since I now can't remember the real reason for saying \"stupid\" will this reason for not remembering save me from having become a kaafir?  \n\n \n\n5.      If I have had become a kaafir from one of the above, would there be anyway of getting back those good deeds I had before saying the word?  \n\n \n\nOnce a person told me, \"Allah is always there to help us not to make things harder for us.\" If I deny that by saying in my heart, \"No he isn’t (meaning Allah is not always there to help us) then do I become a kaafir because of that?  \n\n \n\nDoes saying the following in my heart or verbally make me a kaafir: I’m not certain if I said the following intentionally or if it was the devil putting these thoughts into my mind.  \n\n \n\n6.      “Allah don’t care about you.”  \n\n \n\n7.      “Allah hates you.”  \n\n \n\n8.      “What does He (Allah) care?”  \n\n \n\n9.       “He (Allah) don’t want you”  \n\n \n\n10.  “If I’m not going to be helped, then why bring me into this world?”  \n\n \n\n11.  “Allah doesn’t know what is best for me?”  \n\n \n\n12.  “Allah hasn’t done what is best for me.”  \n\n \n\n13.  “Allah is oppressing me.”  \n\n \n\n14.  “Why is Allah oppressing me?”  \n\n \n\n15.  “Allah hasn’t got time for me.”  \n\n \n\n16.  “Allah doesn’t want to listen to you.”  \n\n \n\n17.  “Allah is so unmerciful”\n\n18. \"Why is Allah so cruel?\"\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. You clearly state that you said the word ‘stupid’ when your efforts went to waste. The word ‘stupid’ was an expression of disappointment for your efforts being wasted. There is nothing about Kufr or Shirk in stating the word ‘stupid’.\n\n2. All the other statements you enquire about do not constitute Kufr or Shirk.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
