  "question": "Many people say Allah-hafiz or Qudah hafiz when departing or ending a conversation. Is it right to say this, what about wassalaam? How do Muslims'depart' ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe words, ?Allah Hafiz? and Khudda Hafiz? are Du?aas commonly used for saying ?Allah protect you.?\n\nThere is no wrong in bidding farewell to someone in this manner. However, it would be better if one learns the Sunnat Du?aa and method of saying farewell, that is, ?Astawdi-u llaaha deenakum wa khawaateema a?amaalikum?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
