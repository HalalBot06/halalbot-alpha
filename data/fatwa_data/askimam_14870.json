  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI hope this mail finds you in good health. I am here to know something inportant about this friend that I have. She's really a good hearted person but somehow always seems to find herself in trouble. Two years ago she commited zina with some guy that she hardly knows. Although she always wanted save herself for her marriage, she said that at the time she was going through some hard time and needed someone to rely on emotionally. But she never intended to lose her dignity. She even prayed to Allah for an alternative way but  it didn't work out to her advantage. After that she went on to commit zina with few more men reasoning that if Allah had really cared for her that she wouldn't have been forced to commit zina just for the sake of some company. But soon she came to her realization and took an oath Allah, Qur'aan and Rasul (pbuh)  that she would never commit the sins again.\n\nIt was perfect for two years except that just recently some friend of hers forced her to get drunk and took advantage of the fact that she was disoriented. Now she is back to commiting all the sins again saying that maybe Allah just doesn't want to help her be a good muslim. Or else why is she commiting these sins much against her intentions when all she wants is to be a good muslim? It's almost as if she falls in some sort of trap everytime and she can't get out of it. Right now as of this moment, she wants to turn her life around for good. She wants to start wearing hijab and pray five times. But she fears that since she has already broken the oath there is no going back. My question is would Allah forgive her if she wants to come back in the right path of Allah although she has once broken her oaths to Allah, Qur'aan and Rasul (pbuh) unintentionally? JazakAllah Khairum.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nYour concern for your friend is an act of great virtue. Allah will reward you abundantly.\n\nIt is human to err and commit sins. Your friend should ret assured that is she is sincere in wanting to change her life, she will find Allah, the Most Merciful, Forgiving. Allah will love her more as she regrets her wrong and wants Allah to forgive her. Your friend should focus on the mercy of Allah and make a firm intention to reform to the best of her ability. If she errs thereafter, she should repent and carry on with her life. Making a mistake should not make her lose hope and abandon her intentions and efforts to change her life.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
