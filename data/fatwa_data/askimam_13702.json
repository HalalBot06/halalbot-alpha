Please guide whats the Kufara in Canadian $$ and if money is too much to pay for me and i cant afford so what else is kufara can i keep fasting again ??. How can I avoid it in future ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to Shariah, if one masturbates while fasting the fast will become invalid. You will only have to keep one Qadha for the missed fast. There is no Kaffarah for breaking the fast by masturbating.\n\nHowever, it is important that you sincerely repent to Allah for this sin. Rasulullah (Sallalaahu Alayhi Wasalam) has cursed those who fulfill their desires in this way. Sincerity demands that you intend never to repeat the sin again. You should abstain from all those things that incites your passion and desire. You should also identify a pious and righteous person who is sensitive to the Laws of Shariah and in whom you have confidence and explain him of your situation. He will guide you and assist you to cope with this evil habit.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
