  "question": "can woman show her breast to other woman? can we wear brassiere and cover from navel till knees and swim in ladies only pools?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf the satr of man and woman is the same i.e., from navel till knees, can one woman see the top of other woman? One of my friends while feeding her kid almost bares her breasts in the presence of us and when asked says breast is not part of women satr. Is this correct? Can we women show our breasts to other woman while changing our dress or feeding our kids? Moreover can we wear brassiere and cover from navel till knees and swim in ladies only pools?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The Satar for men and women are different. The Satar of a woman is her entire body excluding feet and hands. It is prohibited for women to expose her breast to other women.\n\n2. It is permissible for women to swim in private pools on condition the entire body is covered and there are no strange men around.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
