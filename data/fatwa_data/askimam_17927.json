And I also want to about the period of idat and how should it perform.also want to know duas for my father. \n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n“So visit the graveyard, for indeed it will remind you of death.” (Abu Dawud)\n\n \n\nDeath is the beginning of our journey in the Hereafter. It is at this time that we see the reality of the unseen; we will see the angels, the fruits of our good actions and unfortunately, the consequence of our evil deeds. Therefore, it is important to visit the inmates of the grave and to make dua for them, especially one’s parents.\n\n \n\nWhen one visits the graveyard, one should recite the following:\n\nالسلام عليكم أهل الديار من المؤمنين والمسلمين وإنا إن شاء الله للاحقون أسأل الله لنا ولكم العافية          (صحيح مسلم2302) \n\n  Asalaamu alaikum Ahlad diyaar minal mu’mineen wal muslimeen wa in naa Insha Allaha lal hakoon As alullaha lana wa lakumul ‘aafiya\n\n \n\n“Peace be upon you Oh inmates of the grave- the believers and those who submit (to Allah) - and indeed we, Insha Allah, will follow. I ask Allah, for us and for you for ‘Aafiyah (Protection).”\n\n \n\nAt the graveyard, one could recite the following Surah’s of the Quran:\n\n \n\nSura Fatiha                                         \nBeginning verses of Sura Baqarah(till المفلحون)                       \n\nAyatul Kursi                                     \nEnding verses of Sura Baqarah(from امن الرسول)\n\nSura Yaseen   \nSura Mulk\n\nSura Takathur                                     \nSura Ikhlaas(recite 12, 11, 7 or 3 times)\n\nSura Falaq                                           \nSura Naas\n\n \n\nIf one is not fluent in the recitation of the Quran, all of the above may be difficult to recite. In that case, one could just recite Surah Ikhlaas (Qul huwal lahu ahad) (as stated above).\n\nIn essence, any part of the Quran which is easy for recitation could be recited at the graveside. The object is to convey reward to the deceased and this can be fulfilled by the recitation of any part of the Quran. Since the above verses are recorded in the books of Hadith and Fiqh, it will be advisable to recite them; however it is not necessary to recite them.\n\n \n\nIt is very important to always make dua for your deceased father; not only when you go to the graveyard, but at all times. You should make dua of Magfirat (forgiveness) and Rahma (mercy) for him. Make dua that Almighty Allah grant your father Nur (light) in his Qabr and make his           Qabr spacious; make dua for his protection from the punishment of the Qabr and the punishment of Jahannam. And at the beginning or at the end of every day, make this niyat that, whatever good you have done for that day, Allah should grant that reward to be given to your father and to all the Marhoomeen (deceased). By doing this, you will attain reward not only for that particular Ibadat, but for also conveying the reward thereof to the deceased.\n\n \n\nThere is no Iddat at the death of one’s father.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
