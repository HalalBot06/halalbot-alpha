  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni have a few questions to ask regarding 'mazi'\n\nI reached puberty i couple of years ago and there are girls in my school, i am easily aroused and release sperm:\n\n1) does this sperm make me napak ?\n2) is it halal to talk to girls?\n3) how can i prevent this sperm coming out or stop getting aroused by women?\n4) ispef i watch tv and dirty stuff comes up on the show without me knowing it was going to come do i get sinned?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\nThe fluid discharged at the time of arousal is called 'Mazi' (pre-coital fluid).This is a thin clear liquid which necessitates whudu on emission.\n\n'Mani' (Sperm), is a thick fluid which is discharged at the time of ejaculation, this necessitates a Ghusl(bath) on emission.\n\nThe area of clothing soiled by Mazi or Mani should be washed and squeezed out thoroughly thrice for it to be Taahir(clean).\n\nIntermingling of sexes is prohibited in Islam; hence talking to a Non- Mahram (Any female which one is allowed to marry by Shari a') is impermissible.\n\nBeing in school, there are many non-mahram females, even in class and to avoid them is not easy, but as far as possible try your best to abstain from talking and intermingling with them. This is one way to help prevent arousal.\n\nAllah Ta 'ala says in the Holy Quran:\n\nيقول الله تعالى: {قُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يَغُضُّوا مِنْ أَبْصَارِهِمْ وَيَحْفَظُوا فُرُوجَهُمْ ذَلِكَ أَزْكَى لَهُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا يَصْنَعُونَ وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَارِهِنَّ وَيَحْفَظْنَ فُرُوجَهُنَّ وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلَّا مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا  ...  \n\n\"Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and guard their private parts. That is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is acquainted with what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their private parts and not expose their adornments…\"\n\nFrom the above verse we learn that Allah Ta 'ala advises both, the believing men and women to lower their gaze. Guarding the gaze from evil is very important because by looking at wrong, one becomes tempted to do wrong.\n\nImmoral scenes that appear on screen are one of the main reasons the Ulama(Islamic scholars) agreed on the prohibition of television. Therefore abstaining from television will definitely help prevent arousal.\n\nNabi Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم said regarding the gaze:\n\nحدثنا أبو بكر بن أبي شيبة وأبو كريب قالا حدثنا أبو معاوية عن الأعمش عن عمارة بن عمير عن عبد الرحمن بن يزيد عن عبد الله قال * قال لنا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يا معشر الشباب من استطاع منكم الباءة فليتزوج فإنه أغض للبصر وأحصن للفرج ومن لم يستطع فعليه بالصوم فإنه له وجاء \\1\\ مسلم في صحيحه ج2/ص1019 ح1400\n\n\"Oh group of youth! Whoever among you are able (physically, spiritually, financially to marry) then he should marry, for indeed it is more protecting for the gaze and more safeguarding for the private part… and whoever is unable (to marry) then he should fast for indeed that will be a shield for him.\"\n\n \n\nHere we learn that if one is unable to marry then one should fast. Fasting helps prevent arousal. By following these guide lines we will be guided Insh-Allah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nZakariyya Madatt,\n\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
