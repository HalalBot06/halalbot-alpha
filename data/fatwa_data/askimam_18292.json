  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf a man is required to Fard Gusl (Gusl- e-janabat) in the day time of ramadan, how does he do it? It is provided that the man ate sehree and made Niyah for Ramadan. But any how his ramadan is broken. So far I know it is not elligible to eat or drink anything during daytime although his ramadan is broken. But he needs to take Fard Gusl for performing Saalah. So, how does he take gusl. Is it illigal to push water deep inside of his throat and nose? When does kaffara will be placed on him?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nYour fast will not break because of simply requiring a fard ghusl, such as due to a wet dream, for example.  If, however, you did a certain act that necessitates the ghusl, such as sexual intercourse while fasting, then your fast would break (along with requiring kaffārah, in this case). \n\n \n\nIt is permissible, rather necessary in your case, to take ghusl while fasting.  You may take your ghusl as normal, except maintain caution and avoid placing water deep in the throat and nose. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
