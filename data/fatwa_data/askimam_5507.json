  "question": "Rallies.. Islamic value? Muslims all over the US gathered in Washington to protest the US poilicies towards Middle East",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsSalam O Alaikkum, On the April 20th, Muslims all over the US gathered in Washington to protest the US poilicies towards Middle East. Millions of dollars have been spent to organize and to support this rally. First of all, do these kinds of rallies have any Islamic importance? Does ever Holy Prophet (PBUH) and his Shaba (RA) protested this way? We all know about the US policies and I've failed to understand the logic of telling an aggressor that you are an aggressor. Such kinds of rallies had been organised in the past with zero-impact. Secondly, lots of unislamic acts happen in these kinds of rallies, music, dances, un-hijab women etc. It appears to be a big picnic day with families doing the sight seeing than really doing any protest. As far as I know these protests, walks, day of gatherings etc were invented by non-muslims and have no islamic importance. Islam has defined its own day of gatherings that are Eids and a friday gathering every week. Mimber is the place to raise your voice against injustice. How can Muslims change a system by becoming part of that system??? Allah knows the best.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala says in the noble Qur'aan, 'Hold firm to the rope of Allah Ta'ala all together, and do not disunite.' (Aali Imraan Aayat103).%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, 'A Muslim is a%0D%0Abrother to his next Muslim, he neither oppresses him, nor does he abandon%0D%0Ahim to be attacked by the enemy. He who becomes of assistance to his needy%0D%0AMuslim brother, Allah Ta'ala will assist him with his needs.' (Riyaadhus%0D%0Asaaliheen pg.123;Darul Fikr)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe abovementioned quotations clearly indicate that brotherhood and unity is%0D%0Athe actual spirit of Islam. It is, therefore, the duty of every Muslim to%0D%0Astrive to his level best to revive this unity and brotherhood. When Muslims%0D%0Ain our own country and abroad are being oppressed and suffering at the hands%0D%0Aof the non-believers, it becomes the duty of every Muslim to assist these%0D%0AMuslims. It is incumbent upon every Muslim to show and express his worry,%0D%0Aconcern, cry and support for his fellow oppressed Muslims.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe object and purpose of hosting marches and rallies is to create%0D%0Aconfidence within our Muslims to join hands together, bringing all our%0D%0Athoughts together and, in doing so, creating pressure from our side onto%0D%0Athose who are oppressing the Muslims abroad. The purpose of these marches is%0D%0Ato express our support and assistance for our Muslims who are suffering%0D%0Aabroad. As long as these marches and rallies stay within the confines of%0D%0AShari'ah, there is no prohibition for this. Any un-Islamic factor, such as%0D%0AMusic, intermingling of sexes, photography, women in public without proper%0D%0AShar'ee attire, etc. that are prevalent at these marches will render the%0D%0Amarch not permissible.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, if these marches are carried out in a proper Shar'ee manner without%0D%0Aany un-Islamic activities, then this could become a leeway for the%0D%0Aassistance of our oppressed Muslims who are suffering at the hands of the%0D%0Anon-believers. We must, however, remember that since the hosting of such%0D%0Amarches is a very delicate issue. It is important to form a Shura committee%0D%0Aunder the guidance of the Ulama specially dedicated for these types of%0D%0Aissues. Together with such a committee and guidance from the Ulama, the%0D%0Anecessary aspects and requirements about how to organize these marches may%0D%0Abe discussed.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
