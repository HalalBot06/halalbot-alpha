  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease let me know if the following is authentic hadith:\n\nRasulullah (Sallalloho alaihe Wa-aalay wasallam) said:  \"When a man dies and his relatives are busy in funeral, there stands an extremely handsome man by his head. When the dead body is shrouded, that  man gets in between the shroud and the chest of the deceased. When after the burial, the people return home, 2 angels,\nMunkar and Nakeer (names of two special Angels), come in the grave and try to separate this handsome man so that they may be able to interrogate the  dead man in privacy about his faith. But the handsome man says, \"He is my companion,  he is my friend. I will  not leave him alone in any case. If you are appointed for interrogation,  do your job. I cannot leave him until I get him admitted into\nParadise\".  Thereafter he turns to his dead companion and  says, \"I am the Qura'an,  which you used to read, sometimes in a loud  voice and sometimes in a low  voice. Do not worry. After the interrogation of Munkar and Naker, you  will have no grief. When the interrogation is over, the handsome man  arranges for him from Al-Mala'ul A'laa (the  angels in Heaven) a silk bedding filled with musk.  Rasulullah (Sallalloho alaihe Wa-aalay wasallam) said: \"On the Day of Judgement, before Allah, no other intercessor will have a greater status than the Qura'an, neither a  Prophet nor an angel.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n This hadith is narrated by Ubada bin As Samit (radiallahu anhu) and has been recorded by Uqaili in his Ad-Duafa, Ibn Abi Ad Dunya in his Tahajjud, Ibn Ad Darees in Fadaa’il of Quran and has been classified as BAATIL by these and other Scholars of hadith.(Tanzeehush Shar’iyyah, vol 1, pg 292) (AL la’aalil Masnoo’ah, vol 1, pg 219)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
