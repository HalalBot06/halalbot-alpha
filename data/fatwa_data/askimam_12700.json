  "question": "Is it permissible to bid farewell to someone by saying \" Allah aur Rasul Sallahu Alayhi Wassalam kaay hawaalay.\" [ Urdu ] i.e. I give you in the Protection of Allah SWT and His Rasul SAWS?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn other words, is it permissible to say \"I give you in the protection of Allah and His Rasul Sallahu Alayhi Wasallam\" when saying good-bye to someone? Does it signify any distortion of one'e core beliefs or is it OK to say it? Please clarify. I love Rasullah Sallahu Alayhi Wasallam very much. I am asking only since I do not want to err. Also, sometimes whilst talking about some future prospect, my father says :\"Whatever Allah Taala & His Rasul Sallahu Alayhi Wasallam desired will happen.\" Is it permissible to say it or does it also reflect some distortion of core beliefs? Please point out the errors if any, and shed some light on correct beliefs. Jazak Allah khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNabi Kareem (S.A.W.) once instructed Hazrat Ibne Abbas (R.A.) saying: ?Oh lad! Safeguard (the rights of) Allah, Allah will watch over you. Guard (the rights of) Allah you shall find Him in front of you (at your assistance) and when you ask, ask from Allah alone and when you seek assistance, seek from Allah?..?%0D%0A(Mishkaat, Page 453)%0D%0A%0D%0AThese words of advice clearly teach us that we should ask Allah alone for protection under all circumstances. It is incorrect to bid farewell to somebody uttering the words mentioned in your question. It would be sufficient for one to say ?Allah Ke Hawaala.?%0D%0A%0D%0AWith regards to the statement made by your father, Hazrat Mufti Mahmoodul Hasan (R.A.) has stated that it would be Shirk to make such a statement. You explain this to your father and advice him to make sincere Taubah.
