  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI wanted to know if someone is taking a student loan (with interest on it) and there is some extra left, can he use that money to buy a grave for himself?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is not permissible for a student to take an interest bearing loan. The extra amount is also regarded to be Haraam and therefore the money cannot be used to purchase anything.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
