  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease give me the 'NAME OF ALLAH (SWT)' from His 99 Greatest Names (Ism-e-Aazam). Which one should I recite thru which Allah will help me in getting abundant 'RIZQ' and remove 'POVERTY' and re-payment of 'DEBTS' . How many times the Ism-e-Azam should be recited ? and What is the best time to recite ? Please reply me soon as I do not have a job and looking for work desparetly and lots of credit on my credit cards.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is stated in several Ahaadith that whatever prayer is made after the recitation of Ismul-A'zam it is granted by Allah Ta'ala. However, scholars differ in specifying the Ismul-A'zam. These differences of opinion are blessings in disguise. Hereunder are the difference views.\n\n1. Wa ilaahukum ilaahuw waahid . (Baqarah)\n2. Aayatul Kursi\n3. Inna rabbakumullaaahu . muhsineen (A'araaf)\n4. Last 3 Aayaats of Surah Hashr\n\nAllamah Shaami (RA) has quoted Imaam Abu Hanifa (RA) as saying that the Ismul A'zam is the name, 'Allah'. Leader of saints, Shaykh Abdul-Qaadir Jailaaniy, is also of the same view provided that at the time of reciting the word, Allah, there is nothing but Allah in his mind. Some Sufis say it should be recited in such a state of mind which is comparable to that of a drowning person when there is nobody to help him and he calls Allah for help with extreme sincerity.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai</"
