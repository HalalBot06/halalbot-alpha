  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan i pray normally? Or should i ask my doctor? I am pregnant right now. Is it safe for me to pray in the normal way? Can there be any harm to the baby if I go into Sajda as my stomach gets pressed too much. Jazak Allah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou should consult your doctor and follow his/her advise.\n\nIn principle, if it is harmful to go into Sajdah, then you may sit and perform Salaat and make Sajdah through Ishaarah (indication).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
