  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalaam muAleikum. Quran 21-107: \"We send thee not (Mohammad) but as a mercy for all mankind.\" Could you kindly explain to me who is the \"We\", if indeed these are Allah Subbanah Wa'tala's words then should the \"We\" not be \"I\". Shukran\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn Arabic, at times, a singular is expressed in plural due to many reasons.\n\nOne possible reason is to express strength and power. Allah is One but His power and strength supercedes every might and power.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
