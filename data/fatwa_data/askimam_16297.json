  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAsalam O Alikum wr wb,\n\nRef\nFatwa ID:     16242\n\nPlease elaborate\n\n\" The above verse and hadiths are clear proof for the prohibition of reciting behind the imam. However, it will be permissible to recite Quran or any zikr in the heart without moving the lips in the rakats which are inaudible behind the imam. Our advice is that you make the zikr of Allah Ta'ala in your heart and concentrate on the greatness of Allah. It takes self-training to attain full attention and devotion in salat. InshaAllah this method will keep your mind focused in prayer. \"\n\nCan i without moving lips recite fatiha and surah in my heart like we do in normal rakat of namaz when inaudible behind the imam.

However, our advice is that you make zikr by repeating \"Allah-Allah-Allah\" (keep repeating the name of Allah in your heart).\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
