  "question": "As it is apparent that Muslim Ummah is in troubles in contemporary times, shouldnt the righteous ulema of ihlesunnat wal jamah work for establishment of Khilafah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen there is khilafah, the problems will be solved through the ameer, centralized administration will be introduced which will reduce the differences among Muslims etc. Will it be necessary to take a country under control first (like previously it was Afghanistan), and then establish khilafah and implement shariah over there? If the platform of Jamiat Ulema Islam does this, wont it be fruitful? 2) Please tell what efforts are being taken currently to establish khilafah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, we wish to advise that establishing a Khilaafah will not solve any problem, rather increase the differences. Nevertheless, establishment of Khilaafat in present day context is difficult. Due to the political set up globally and the Muslims getting pushed from pillar to post, the Khilaafat will not solve the problem of easing the differences.\n\nThe problems of the Muslims shall only be solved if we adopt the method that was adopted of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum). That is the method of Imaan and good actions (Amaal-e-Saalihah). Imam Maaliki (RA) used to say the latter part of this Ummat shall not attain success till it adopts the way of the first part of this Ummah, i.e. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
