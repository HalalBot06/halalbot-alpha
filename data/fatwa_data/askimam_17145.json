  "question": "Should i do Qadha Umri?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni want to ask a question that if we did not prayed namaz because of illness,or haiz so can i keep fast after Ramadan and can i pray kazae umri?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nA woman will not perform any salāt and will not keep fast in her menses. The salāts not performed during these do not have to be made up. The fasts will have to be made up (qadā’) outside the month of Ramadān.\n\nIf a person is sick, salāt will still have to be performed. If he/she is not able to stand, then the salāt should be performed sitting. If that is also difficult, then it should be performed lying down.\n\nThe salāt was not performed, the person will have to repent to Allāh ask for his forgiveness. The qadā’ for the salāt should be performed as soon as possible. It is compulsory to make up the qadā’ salāts a person has due upon him, even if they are many in number. A schedule or chart should be adopted to assist in keeping track how many are left.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Ehzaz Ajmeri,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nConcurred by:\n\nMl.
