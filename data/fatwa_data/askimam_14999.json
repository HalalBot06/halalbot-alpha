  "question": "My question is that when i am performing Fajr, Magrib or Esha, do i have to read the first two rakaats audibly?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDue to my travels, i very often perform Salaat on my own. My question is that when i am performing Fajr, Magrib or Esha, do i have to read the first two rakaats audibly, or can i read them silently - and this question also extends to ladies who perform salaat at home, must they read the first two rakaats of Magrib, Esha, and two rakaats of FAJR audibly or silently.\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is permissible for a male to perform the first two rakaats of Maghrib, Esha and Fajr aloud even though he may be performing Salaah individually. Women should not make audible Qirat in Salaah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
