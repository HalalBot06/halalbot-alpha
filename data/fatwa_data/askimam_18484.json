  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nI would like to ask something relating to the judgement day, as I am very worried after what my husband told me.\n\n \n\nI did some mistake with my husband but I denied it. As he is smart enough, he thinks I lied. But he told me - he will not leave me in this life and he trusts me - but anyway he will see the truth on the Judgement day, when he will ask God about the truth. He told me in this case he can ask God to dont be with me in paradise and that he will not forgive me - that means i will go to hell.\n\n \n\nPlease, tell me, is something like this possible? I am very sorry for what I did and I will never do it again, but I am afraid it will really happen and after the death my beloved husband will know and I will lose him and the paradise forever.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIslam has given certain rights to the husband over the wife and certain rights to the wife over the husband. There should be love, compassion, and honesty between the husband and wife. Both husband and wife should be conscious of one another’s rights over the other. Speaking lies breaks the trust between the two spouses and causes the displeasure of Allah جل جلاله .\n\n \n\nWe advise you to repent sincerely to Allah جل جلاله and have firm intention of not repeating that mistake again. Furthermore, ask your husband to forgive you for whatever you did. There is no need to ask him specifically about that mistake if you think that is going to hurt him.\n\nAllah جل جلاله is not bound to send anyone to jannah or jahannam. He can forgive whomsoever He wishes, and grant him jannah through his mercy. Similarly, Allah can reproach anyone He wishes, out of His justice and punish him with hellfire. Therefore, with repentance, you should have hope in the mercy and forgiveness of Allah جل جلاله\n\nMay Allah جل جلاله grant us His happiness here and in the Hereafter.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl.
