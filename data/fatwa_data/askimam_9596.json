Has he been subjected to comments and ridicule damaging his male ego on possible issues, including not having the ability to father a child? Has his concern for second wife stemmed from the need for children? Look for short term goals and successes for you as a couple, e.g. What if you both adopt a child (according to Shar?ee laws), will this bring happiness?%0D%0A%0D%0AIdentify his positive points like his character, features and small successes in your marital life. Discuss what pleases you in your sexual relationship. If requiring physical stamina, eat such nutritional foods and vitamins which increases vitality. Perhaps, change of place, job to his liking may enhance his moods and your relationship in turn.%0D%0A%0D%0AIs there a possibility that he has taken interest in some other women and may have guilt, hence, situation.%0D%0A%0D%0AMake him important ? beautify yourself, luring him and loving him. Make the effort and Du?aas. Increase your Tawbah and resign the will to Allah Ta?ala. Don?t focus on blaming, but bring in laughter, love and romance to the marriage. It?s a challenge and you are never too old. %0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta?ala make it easy. Whatever the outcome, don?t be depressed. Insha Allah, you will be rewarded.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A2SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
