  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nmy husband does not speak to his sister beacause a few years ago she moved out the house because of an argument with her father. she now lives her non muslim granparents and has a non muslim boyfriend. she is now pregnant and her boyfrien will not turn muslim. but her parents did nothing about the problem, they have asked her to come home but she refuses and she acts more like a non muslim than a muslim by the way she dresses etc. she wanted to get married to her boyfriend but her father refused, saying that she would not be a muslim. is my husbad right for cutting her off from his life?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n \n\nIt is understandable for your husband to want to sever his relations to his sister fearing the evil effects of her actions upon him and his family. However, the dictates of maintaining family ties would demand that he try his best to reason with her and explain to her the harms of her actions. If he decides to sever ties with her and leaves her to do as she pleases, it could result in the most unfortunate situation where she reneges from the fold of Islam. This will be a tremendous loss. We recommend that your husband and the remainder of the family make the most of the blessed month of Ramadan by making continuous du‘ā for her. At the same time, he should attempt to discuss the matter with her in a soft and loving tone. He needs to win her confidence and that could take some time. With patience, much du‘ā and the help of Allah, her heart will change. We make du‘ā that Allah assist your husband in his efforts and his sister in acting in accordance to the dictates of the Sharī‘ah. Amīn.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
