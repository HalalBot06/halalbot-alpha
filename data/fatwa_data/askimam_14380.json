  "question": "is it permissible to read quran in sleeping state if a woman is pregnant",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nis it permissible to read quran in sleeping state if a woman is  pregnant.and is there any importance of the days in which can fast(nawafil) because generally we dont treat tuesday to be auspicious.so can we start fasting on tuesday.did our prophet (pbuh) mention the importance of the days we fast.and is this true that once a girl  is married then she has to stay in her husband's home more and a little less in her mother's home.did our prophet (pbuh) mention any thing regarding this issue or we have innovated this tradition.i would be thankfull if you can sort out these issues.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. It is extremely important to maintain Adab (etiquette) when reciting the Quraan. This is the word of Allah. Etiquette is an important component of Deen. Allamah Shaami (R.A) states that disregard for etiquette eventually deprives a person from acts of obedience and worship. Therefore it is vital that the respect is shown to the Quraan and books of Deen. Sahabah revered the Quraan to such an extent that when they used to hold the Quraan, they should exclaim out of ecstasy and joy these are the words of my Allah and they would become unconscious with the result of this.\n\nAn expectant woman does become tired and fatigue. If she finds difficulty in reciting the Quraan in the sitting position, she may lie down and recite with the greatest of respect and honour in her heart. The Quraan should not be taken as a bed time novel which generally is read just before retiring to bed.\n\n2. It was the noble habit of Rasulullah () to observe fast on Monday and Thursday. It is encouraged to fast on these days of the week. Tuesday has no special significance. Therefore, one should not specify Tuesday to observe fast. It is preferable to follow the Sunnah and fast on Monday and Thursday.\n\n3. Rasulullah () has not mentioned anything to this effect. This is a mutual understanding between the husband and wife when and how long she may go to her parent’s home. There are customs and traditions in this regard as to when the wife must go etc. However, this is not proven from any authentic source of Islam.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
