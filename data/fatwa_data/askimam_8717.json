For someone born and raised in America is it obligatory for them to move to a Muslim country?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi Math-hab only Samak (Fish species) is permissible to eat from the sea animals, therefore crabs and lobsters will not be permissible to eat. However, with regards to shrimps, if they are categorised as Samak then it will be permissible to eat otherwise not. Some jurists have categorised it as fish and others have not, therefore it will be Makrooh (odious).%0D%0A%0D%0ATo consider the order of the Surahs is from the etiquettes of the recitation in Salaah.
