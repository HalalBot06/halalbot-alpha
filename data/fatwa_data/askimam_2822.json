  "question": "Is there a dua or ayat from Quran that one can say to harden the heart, and help with sensitivity?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome people are sensitive and very soft hearted. This is causing a problem within their marriage. Is there anything that can be done to make one party less sensitive and have a harder heart?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFor Abundance in Rizq\n\nE) The reading of 'al-Mughniy' (The Enricher) 1,100 times and Surah Muzammil\n40 times (otherwise 11 times if it difficult to read 40 times) is very\neffective in acquiring sufficiency of the heart.\n\nF) Excessive recitation of 'al-Waasii`' (The All-Encompassing) creates\ncontentment and self-sufficiency and it is also very effective in creating\ndetermination and courage in a person.\n\n[ extract from 'Remedies from the holy Qur'aan' ]\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
