In principle, if the parents are unable to visit their daughters at her husband?s house, then it is advisable for the husband to allow his wife to visit her parents according to a period that is mutually agreed upon. If the parents are not pious, then the husband should counsel his wife in regards to abstaining from the wrongdoing and taking practical steps in rectifying the situation. The wife should also ponder and devise a plan, in regards to correcting the situation. If the parents are unable to visit their daughter at her husband?s house, then the wife has the right to visit her parent to the extent of the general custom of visiting. (Fathul Qadeer vol.3 pg.335)%0D%0A%0D%0AAccording to the Shaafi?ee Madhab, the husband also has the right to prevent his wife from visiting her parent?s house. However, if the parents are ill, then it is Makrooh to prevent her from visiting them. (al-Mufassal fee Ahkaamil Mar?ati vol.7 pg.294)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The husband does not have control over the wife?s finances. She is independent in regards to her personal wealth. Allah Ta?ala states, ?And if you have given one of them (i.e. your wives) a Qintaar (of gold), take not the least bit of it back; would you take it wrongfully without a right and (with) a manifest sin.? When Allah Ta?ala has not given the husband control over the wealth which the husband himself has given the wife, then how can he ever have control over the wealth which she herself has earned.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. In principle, it is the Waajib duty of the father to provide child support as long as the child is not wealthy enough to support himself. If the father neglects in his duty, he is sinful and legal action may be taken against him. However, if the child owns enough money to support him%2Fherself, then it no longer remains the father?s duty to provide child support. (Shaami vol.3 pg.612; HM Saeed)%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Your question is very general. We are unable to provide an answer, kindly provide further details.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. In regards to resolving personal problems, there are two aspects; a) One is mediation, i.e. when one plays the roles of an intercessor and advisor. Secondly is arbitration. This is where one is appointed to look into both parties? grievances and then pass a legal document binding both parties to the given decision. However, it should be noted that arbitration is a skill on its own, which have very far reaching effects. If it is not handled properly, it might result in a disastrous end. Therefore, if you are uncertain in regards to it, we advise you do not shoulder its responsibility.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. The husband has no right to usurp the money given to the children. He is sinful in doing so and must compulsorily return the money.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
