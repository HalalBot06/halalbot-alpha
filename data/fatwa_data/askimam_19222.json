  "answer": "QUESTION\nI want to read the Quran but I don’t understand the meaning. Would it be ok if I read the translation of the Quran in English instead of the Arabic text, which I don’t understand? I don’t want to read both at once.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nStudying the translation and meaning of the Holy Quran is a highly virtuous act. One should spare some time daily for this with the intention of acting upon what he learns. However, studying the meaning of the Quran should be done under the guidance of a qualified Alim. If this is not possible then one should make use of a reliable and authentic tafsir book. We recommend “Ma’ariful Quran” by Mufti Shafi Usmani, which is available in Urdu and English.\n\nHowever, note that reciting the Quran in the original Arabic text is a separate act of worship and should never be forsaken. Great merits have been mentioned in the ahaadith for reciting the Glorious Quran. Special rewards have also been mentioned for reciting specific Surahs and verses of the Quran. The sahabah and all the pious predecessors went to great lengths to perfect the recitation of the Holy Quran and they spent long hours reciting it. Therefore, you should not deprive yourself of the blessings and rewards of reciting the Quran in the original text. Spare some time daily for both studying the meaning of the Quran in English with a teacher and for the recitation of the Quran in Arabic.\n\nHereunder are some ahaadith pertaining to the virtues of reciting the Glorious Quran:\n\nAbdullah Ibn Mas’ood (Radiyallaahu Anhu) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (Sallallaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) said, “Whoever recites a letter from the Book of Allah, for him is a reward; and every reward is multiplied by ten. I do not say that Alif Laam and Meem is a letter; rather, Alif is a letter, Laam is a letter and Meem is a letter.”\n\n \n(Tirmizi; Fadaa’il Suwar al-Quran al-Kareem pg. 38, Daarussalaam)\n \n\nAbdullah Ibn Mas’ood (Radiyallaahu Anhu) narrates, “Learn the Quran and recite it, because you will be rewarded with ten rewards for every letter – I do not mean Alif Laam Meem (is one letter); rather Alif and Laam and Meem (are separate letters).” In another narration he says that Alim and Laam and Meem are equivalent to thirty rewards.\n\n \n(Fadaa’il Suwar al-Quran al-Kareem pg. 38, Daarussalaam)\n \n\nAbdullah Ibn Abbas (Radiyallaahu Anhu) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (Sallallaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) said, “Verily the person in whose heart is nothing from the Quran is like a deserted house.”\n\n \n(Ibid pg. 40)\n \n\nAbu Sa’eed Al-Khudri (Radiyallaahu Anhu) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (Sallallaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) said, “The Almighty Lord says: Whoever is preoccupied with the Quran and with My remembrance due to which he is unable to ask from me, I shall give him better than what I give to those who ask. And the superiority of the Word of Allah over all other words is like the superiority of Allah over His creation.”\n\n \n(Ibid pg. 41)\n \nAnd Allah knows best.\n \nMl.
