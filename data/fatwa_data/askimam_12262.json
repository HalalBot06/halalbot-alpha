  "question": "Imam Sahib I would like your opinion on Mr. Harun Yahya & his work ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRecently I read his book ?An Illusion called Matter?. In this book Mr.Yahya has explained the nature of this world and the way we perceive it. Moreover, in one of his articles he has also defended that his book does not refer to Wahadat-ul-Wujood. As I m planning to translate and distribute his work in Pakistan to help myself and other misguided people, therefore, please advise me with your opinion on this issue urgently. Allah Hafiz & Nigheban\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not possible for us to offer our comments on his book as we did not see or study the book. You may refer your query to the Muftis of Pakistan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
