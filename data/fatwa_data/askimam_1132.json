  "question": "What is the panshement for taking of the mendeela?Is it wrong to talk to someone your not engaged to yet? But know u will be soon?If so why?What can u do when your engaged to someone?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe do not know what is meant by ?Mendeela?. If a boy and girl are engaged, they are still Ghayr Mahaarim to one another. They have to observe strict Hijaab until they marry, therefore, it is not permissible for them to communicate with one another before marriage. If by ?Mendeela? you refer to the Hijaab, then it is incorrect to remove it to please your future husband. That being the remedy to his Salaat and fasting is incorrect. What if he still does not perform Salaat and fast? and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
