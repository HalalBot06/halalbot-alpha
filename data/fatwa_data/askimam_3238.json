  "question": "Kindly interpret the meaning of this dream.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe other day, i was sleeping and i had this dream in which i heard Azaan ul Fajr. The strange thing was, in my dream, i saw the clock and the time was 01:10 am and Fajr is always at 4:00 am in UAE. Surprisingly, in my dream, i saw the sun had also risen at that time. Then, a terrible storm came. And it came towards my house (towards our balcony), where me and my mom were standing. It tried to attack us, but we closed the door of the balcony. It caused no harm to us, but we were very scared. I am also giving my exams nowadays. Has it anything to do with my exams? Plz help and explain.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream indicates the day of Qiyaamat being near.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
