  "question": "Question Concerning this Upcoming Eid Al Adha. Who should we follow if the local scholars are split in opinion? Details in Question.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1.) Under which Madhabs must we go with the local sighting and under which Madhabs must we go with the Hujjaj? If the local scholars (same madhabs) are divided on the day of Eid which day should we make eid? 2.) If we are supposed to Fast the day of Arafat, must we do it on the day of Arafat of the Hujaj? 3.) Just some advice for your site, sometimes you give rulings that only apply to Hanafi not others: For example in the question at: http://islam.tc/ask-imam/view.php?q=5942, It say?s that it is Fard to Rinse the mouth and nose, but this is NOT the case for Shaf?ee or Hanbali as we recently learnt from our scholars in a Halaqa covering Salah of the 4 Madhabs. Similarly there were questions about Wudu where you said that Â¼ of the head must be wiped in Masah of the Head in Wudu, But infact in Hanafi/Maliki it must be the WHOLE head and in Shafi the Rukhsah is only 1 hair. And also in Wudu I think you answered a question saying that one?s wudu is valid even if the preceding body parts became dry before the Wudu finished, but In Maliki and Hanbali there is the concept of ?Moo-a-laa? meaning not leaving a delay between the actions in Wudu or else the Wudu is invalid. Inshallah You should be careful and say its only for Hanafi.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. You should follow the sighting of your country. Consult the local Ulama and follow their rulings. If there is a split amongst the Ulama, then whoever is more conscious of Shari?ah, you should follow them.\n\n2. It is virtuous to fast on all the first 9 days of Dhul-Hijjah. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?For the fast in first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah is equivalent to 1 year of fasting.? You should follow your local date, not the Hujjaaj.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
