If there is no Habs, then she is not entitled to any maintenance from the husband. You state that your wife applied to the family court and restricted you from visiting and living with her. She decided not to stay with you. You did not chase her out of the house. Therefore, she is a Naashiza, (a disobedient wife) and she is not entitled to any maintenance from you. Her claim for alimony, monthly income and Haqq e Mahr is baseless.\n\nWe also wish to advise you that the annulment of the marriage in the court does constitute a civil divorce and not Talaq. Accordingly, she is still your wife. If she wants maintenance, you have a right to call her to stay with you. If she refuses she is not entitled to maintenance. Our advise is you issue her a Talaq e bain (an irrevocable Talaq) and sever the Nikah. Do not worry about her empty threats.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa, Madrassah In'aamiyyah"
