The remaining five days will%0D%0Abe regarded as Istihaadha wherein you will not be exempted from Salaat, etc.%0D%0A(Hidaaya vol.1) Kindly refer 'Rules Pertaining to the Ma'zur' - below%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0ARULES RELATING TO THE MA'ZUR%0D%0A%0D%0A* If someone's nose begins to bleed in such a way that it doesn't stop, or has a wound from which blood flows continuously, or is afflicted by the sickness of urine dripping continuously - and in all these cases he does not have such a time wherein he could offer his salaat with (complete) purity - then such a person is called a ma'zur (excused). The rule in regard to him is that he should make Wudhu for the time of every salaat. As long as that salaat time remains, his Wudhu will remain. However, if apart from this sickness, some other matter crops up which causes Wudhu to break, then his Wudhu will break and he will have to repeat it. An example of this is: a person's nose began to bleed continuously and refused to stop. At Zuhr time he made Wudhu. So as long as the Zuhr time remains, his Wudhu will not break as a result of the bleeding nose. However, if (in that Zuhr time) the person went to the toilet, or pricked himself with a needle and blood flowed, then Wudhu will break and will have to be repeated. When this time passes, and the next salaat time comes, then another Wudhu will have to be made (for this second salaat time). In like manner, Wudhu should be made for every salaat time. With this Wudhu, one can read any number and any type of salaat - irrespective of Fard or nafl salaat. %0D%0A* If Wudhu was made at Fajr time, then after sunrise, salaat cannot be read with that Wudhu. A fresh avdu will have to be made. If Wudhu was made after sunrise, then it would be permissible to read Zuhr with that Wudhu and there's no need to make a fresh Wudhu for Zuhr. When Asr time enters, then only will it be necessary to make a fresh Wudhu. However, if Wudhu breaks for some other reason (eg. urinating or passing stool), then fresh Wudhu will have to be made (as mentioned above). %0D%0A* A person had a wound which bled continuously. So he made Wudhu. Thereafter, another wound emerged and began to bleed. The Wudhu will break and will have to be made.again. %0D%0A* A person will only be classified as a ma'zur and this ruling will only apply to him when one complete time passes wherein the blood flows continuously, and he is unable to read the salaat of that time in complete purity. If such a time is found wherein salaat could be offered with complete purity, then he won't be classified as a Ma'zur. Whatever rules that have just been mentioned, will not apply to him. However, if one complete time passed, wherein he did not get the opportunity to offer salaat in total purity, then he will be classified as a ma'zur. Now, the same rules apply to him, i.e. make a fresh Wudhu for every salaat time. When the next salaat time comes, then it is not a pre-requisite that blood should flow at the time. In fact, if in that entire period, blood only flows once, and stops flowing for the rest of the time - then too the person will be classified as a Ma'zur. However, if after this, an entire time passes in which no blood flowed at all, then the person will not remain in Ma'zur. Now the ruling will be that each time blood flows, Wudhu will break. %0D%0A* Dhuhr time had already entered and only after that the blood of the wound began to flow. So he should wait till the end of the time. If it stops, well and good. And if it doesn't stop, then he should make Wudhu and offer his salaat. Now, if it continued flowing during the entire time of Asr and to the extent that he could not perform his Asr salaat, then when the Asr time passes, he will be classified as a Ma'zur. If the blood stops flowing in the very time of Asr, then he won't be regarded as a ma'zur and whatever salaats he may have read in this time will not be proper and will have to be repeated. %0D%0A* On account of urinating or passing stool, a ma'zur made Wudhu. At the time of making Wudhu, the bleeding had stopped. After completing Wudhu, the blood started to flow again. By the flowing of this blood, Wudhu will break. However, that Wudhu which was made on account of the bleeding of the nose, etc.; that particular Wudhu will not break on account of bleeding of the nose. %0D%0A* If this blood falls on the clothing, etc. then check: if it will fall again before he can complete his salaat, then it won't be wajib to wash it off. But if he knows that it won't fall again so quickly and that salaat could be performed in purity, then it will be wajib to wash it off. If the extent of the blood is more than the size of a fifty cents coin then salaat will not be complete without washing it off. %0D%0A%0D%0ADarul Ifta"
