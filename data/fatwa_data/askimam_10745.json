  "question": "Is this halaal? a Muslim brother owns a KFC. ...found out that the halaal chicken is fried in the same oil as the non-halaal chicken!",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn Cerritos, CA, USA a Muslim brother owns a KFC. One can buy halaal chicken from him. However after questioning him, I found out that the halaal chicken is fried in the same oil as the non-halaal chicken! And not separately as presumed. He insists this is allowed as the chicken is fried in very high temps. Everyone trusts him and believes they are eating halaal. All VERY confused. Please advice.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf Halaal chicken is fried in the same oil as non-Halaal chicken, the Halaal chicken will become impure and cannot be consumed.\n\nThe oil being of very high temperature does not change the ruling. It is not permissible for Muslims to each such chicken.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
