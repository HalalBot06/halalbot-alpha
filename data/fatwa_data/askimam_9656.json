The bride gives consent to her representative (Wakeel) in the presence of two witnesses to perform her marriage at the Masjid. At the Masjid, the Wakeel represents the bride in the presence of the two witnesses and the stipulated dowry. The witnesses must be two trustworthy and pious male Muslims who are not her ascendants e.g. father, grandfather or decendants e.g. son, grandson, etc.\n\nThe Mahr (dowry) is the woman's right and should be stipulated prior to the marriage.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
