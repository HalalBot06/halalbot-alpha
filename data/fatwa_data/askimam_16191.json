  "question": "What is considered as preceding the imam in Shari'ah?....When does one start the action behing an Imam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIt is commonly known that in congregational salaat, one should not precede (go ahead of) the imam in any action.\n\n\n1) What is considered as preceding the imam in Shari'ah?\n       a) If one starts going into Ruku' before the imam has said \"Allahu Akbar\", is this considered preceding?\n       b) If one starts going into Ruku' after the imam has started saying \"Allahu Akbar\" but before the imam has finished saying it, is this considered preceding?\n       c) If one starts going into Ruku' only after the imam has completed saying the whole phrase of \"Allahu Akbar\", but due to his speed and the imam's slowness, ends up in the final Ruku' position before the imam does, is this considered preceding?\n2) Does one:\n       a) Act as soon as he hears the imam start saying \"Allahu Akbar\" OR\n       b) Act only after the imam has finished saying \"Allahu Akbar\"\n       c) Also need to ensure that he is not preceding the imam in terms of physical position at any time during the salaat? If yes, how?\n \n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1) Imam Bukhari رحمه الله narrates on the authority of Abu Huraira رضى الله عنه Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم said:\n\nصحيح البخاري باب اثم من رفع راسه قبل الامام\n\nعن ( محمد بن زياد ) سمعت ( أبا هريرة ) عن النبي قال أما يخشى أحدكم أو ألا يخشى أحدكم إذا رفع رأسه قبل الإمام أن يجعل الله رأسه رأس حمار أو يجعل الله صورته صورة حمار\n\n“Does he who precedes the imam not fear that Allah Ta’ala changes his appearance to that of a donkey?” Bukhari 691\n\nIt is clear from the above narration that a person should not precede the imam in any action of salah. As such, in a, b and c a person will be guilty of preceding the Imam.  \n\n2) A person should commence his salah as soon as he hears the imam saying the takbeer. However, if a person has not completed a wajib act, for example he did not finish reciting the tashahhud and the imam stands up, then he should first complete tashahhud and then follow the imam.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
