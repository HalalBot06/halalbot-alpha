  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have period issue. It came on 29th Sept. and was clean on the 6th of October. Generally the cyle is a 21 day cyle. But this time it showed up again on October 16th just on Fajar time. By Zuhr time there was no sign of it so performed ghusal and prayed Zuhr namaz. Question is: 1. Is this Istihaza and Is my fast permissible? 2. What about offering prayers and reading Quran and fasting in case the period continues? 3. When a person is in Istihaza, do they have to perform Ghusal daily or just perform Wudhu before every prayer? and once the period is over in the Istihaza condition, is Ghusal necessary? 4. Is there any book regarding how to deal with issues of menstruation in Islam? 5. when a person is in the state of wudu and they cut their nails or wax hair from the upper lip , is the wudu valid? Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is istihaazha and thus the fast is permissible.\n2. One can recite Quran, perform salah and fast when in the state of Istihaazha.\n3. One is istihaazha has to perform wudhu for every salah time. There is no need for ghusl when this condition stops.\n4. Behisti Zewar discusses them in sufficient detail.\n5. Cutting the nails or waxing doesn't break wuhdu.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Husain Kadodia\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Ml. Imraan Vawda"
