  "question": "Marriage with preconditions - if he decides to resettle back to India or other country then the marriage would need to be annulled or he should give her divorce",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu alaikum Dear Respected Shaikh A brother of mine who has recently moved to UK has got a marriage proposal from a British Indian family who is very religious. However the bride and her father has laid down the condition that the groom will settle in UK and if ever he decides to resettle back to India or other country then the marriage would need to be annulled or he should give her divorce. We are not sure if a marriage with such a precondition is valid according to Islam and would like your verdict on going ahead with this proposal.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe stipulation of such a condition will be regarded as null. The Nikaah\nwill be valid but the condition will have no effect on the Nikaah. (Mashroot\nNikaah - Qazi Mujaahidul Islaam 64/65 )\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
