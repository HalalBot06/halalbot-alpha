Our responsibility is submission to Allah and His orders as explained to us by Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). We have to express our obedience to Allah Ta?ala in every walk of our life.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt does not behove us to do as we wish and against the orders of Allah Ta?ala. It is obvious that expressing submission requires us to go against our desires. In brief, it requires sacrifice, for which there are great rewards in store for us in the hereafter. Reverting to your matter, kindly keep our advise in mind while you read our ruling.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf your husband issued you three divorces on the three different instances, that constitutes a Talaaq-e-Mughalladha (permanently irrevocable divorce). It is not permissible for you to live together with your former husband. We appreciate that you love your former husband, but precedence must be given to fulfilling the order of Allah. It is now Haraam (strictly prohibited) for you to live with your former husband. You are bound by the Shari?ah to separate from him immediately. As regards your children, they may live with you. It is the father?s responsibility to provide maintenance for them.%0D%0A%0D%0ASister, we advise you to bring the courage and obey the order of Allah. The difficulties that you may experience in doing that will not go unnoticed by Allah. You will be greatly rewarded for your sacrifices. Remember, we will die one day with our worldly love and passion and be subjected to accountability in the court of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
