  "answer": "QUESTION\nAnd if the answer is NO, please also explain. Jazakallah. Salaam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBanks and Insurance companies deal in Interest which is strictly prohibited in the Noble Qurãn and Ahaadith of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam).\n\n'O you who believe! Fear Allah and leave that which remains on interest if you are believers. If you don't (abstain from Interest) then announce war with Allah and His Prophet.' (Baqarah 278-279)\n\nHadhrat Jaabir (Radhiallaahu Ánhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) cursed the person who takes Interest as well as the giver, the writer and the witnesses; and, added saying they are all equal. (Mishkãt p. 244)\n\nWorking in banks and Insurance companies will be assisting in sin, which is also prohibited. Allah Taãla says in the Noble Qurãn, 'And do not assist in sin.' (Maaidah 2)\n\nIn the light of the above explanation, it is not permissible to work in any department of an Insurance company or bank.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
