  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy question has to do regarding the length of beard. I understand that the sharee length of the beard  is a fist length.  Does this fist length account for the visible portion of the beard or the length of the hair in the beard? The hair in my beard are very curly and they are individually longer than a fist-length. Is it permissible to trim the length of the hair in the beard that is more than a fist length to make the beard appear well-groomed, although visibly the beard might not look appear to be a fist-length?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe actual length of the hair of the beard is considered in the fist length. The mere visible portion of the bear is not considered.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
