The aspect of credits and banking project is not clear.\n\nIs it a banking project for your company? If so, it will be permissible. If it is a project of a conventional bank, it will be Makrooh as that will be assisting in sin. The income of such a project will be Makrooh.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
