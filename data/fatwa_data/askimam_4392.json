  "question": "Is it permissible for a convert to Islam from Judaism to say Jewish prayers for the dead for deceased relatives?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamu alaikum! I am a new convert to Islam from Judaism. After a parent or near relative dies, Jews are supposed to recite the Mourner's Kaddish, a prayer in Hebrew praising the greatness of God, for them. Would I be permitted to recite it or say it along with a group? I have not told my family of my conversion and they would expect me to go along with it. And during Jewish holidays such as Hanukkah, before I converted, I would give money to Jewish and Israeli charities. Would this be permissible? Does Islam require that all other religious practices, even those of the People of the Book, be rejected on converting to Islam?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe contents of your e-mail is very encouraging. Your reversion to Islam is%0D%0Aa great gift and bounty from Allah. You are indeed a chosen person by Allah.%0D%0AMay Allah grant you internal strength and keep you steadfast on Imaan%0D%0A(faith) of Islam (Aameen).%0D%0AIf you have not informed your family members of your reversion to Islam and%0D%0Arequire time to do so due to your personal circumstances and you are%0D%0Acompelled to attend the Kaddish prayer, you will be excused for that. We%0D%0Aadvise you praise Allah in the Kaddish for granting you Islam and pray for%0D%0Athe true guidance of the Jewish nation to Islam. You should also guard%0D%0Ayourself against any anti-Islamic feelings and sentiments as such an%0D%0Aattitude breaths hatred for Islam and the Muslims. A human being does get%0D%0Aeffected with his%2Fher surroundings and atmosphere.%0D%0AYou will be excused for making any charitable contribution to Israeli%0D%0Acharities before your reversion to Islam.%0D%0AWhen Abdullah Ibn Salam (RA) (a leading personality and a scholar among the%0D%0AJews) accepted Islam, Allah revealed the following verses \"Oh you who%0D%0Abelieve, enter into Islam completely\" We advise you consider the above and%0D%0Amake adjustments to finally comply with the order of Allah. The practice of%0D%0AAbdullah Ibn Salam (RA) is indeed the best guide for you.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
