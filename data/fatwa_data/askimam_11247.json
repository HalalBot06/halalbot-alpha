  "question": "is this contract is legal according to Islam in which Time and Quantity is not fixed of the goods which I have to supply",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to our understanding of your question, a person ordered goods but the quantity and time for supplying the goods and payments is not fixed.\n\nIf our understanding is correct, then such a contract is invalid as the order and other related issues are not specified. That leads to a dispute. In principle, any transaction that has a potential of a dispute is invalid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
