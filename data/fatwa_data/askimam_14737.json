  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nNowadays there is much propaganda against the Deobandis by the followers Ahmed Raza al-Barelwi. To be frank, I'm quite confused. I would like you to answer some of the accusations directed against the Deobanid-movement. Here are some purported beliefs of the Deobandis:\n\n1. A follower (member of the Ummah) can surpass the Prophets in deeds. (Tahzeer-ul-Naas)\n2. It is not necessary for the Prophets to be immune from saying blatant lies. (Tasfia-ul-Aqaid)\n3. To think about the Prophet whilst one is in prayer is worse than being engrossed in the thoughts of adultery, or thinking about a donkey or an ox. (Siraate-Mustaqeem)\n4. It is possible for Allah to tell lies (Yakrozi).\n5. It is a heresy to deem Allah free from time and space (Idha-ul-Haq)\n6. One who considers the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) as his mediator and intercessor on the Day of Resurrection, is equal to Abu Jahal in polytheism. (Taqwiat-ul-Iman)\n7. To travel for the sake of visiting the mausoleums of any Prophet (peace be upon them) or any saint, or to illuminate their mausoleums, to carpet them, to sweep there, give people water to drink or make arrangements for their ablution and bathing - (all this) is polytheism. (Taqwiat-ul-Iman).\n\nIt would be much appreciated if you could clarify your stance. It is my impression that many young Muslims are being misled and made to hate elders such as Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi, Maulana Ilyas and many others.\n\nAlso, please answer if you are familiar with the teachings of Amin Ahsan Islahi and Shibli Numani. Is it permissible to read their books?\n\nPS do edit my questions before posting them on your site if you think that they can be more appropriately answered by doing so or if they have the possibility of inciting Fitnah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nThese aforementioned allegations levelled against our Deobandi Ulama are notsomething new. The same allegations were levelled against them decades ago. Their writings or words have been quoted out of context purely to discredit them and in an attempt to tarnish their reputation. This hatred stems from the anti Bidah stance of our Deobandi Ulama. Due to their vociferous criticism of the Barelwis and their ilk, the bidatis spurred by their malice have attempted to discredit the deobandi Ulama by misquoting their writings.\n\n \n\nWe are unaware of Amin Ahsan Islahi. You may read books compiled by Moulana Shibli Numani.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Muhammed Kadwa\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\nThe guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\nEducation and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\nIslam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\nWhen one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\nMuslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\nWe have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\nIf you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\nIf that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\nRasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit”.\n\n \n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
