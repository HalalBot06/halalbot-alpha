  "answer": "QUESTION\nI know a women who put curses on people around her by using Quranic Ayat.Every night after isha prayer she do the tasbhee of ya huyy ya qayyum and other thing I don?t know, pray Daroud Sharif before and after this and do it for one hour. She said that her Aamil give her the permission to do so. She don?t like the two women those women got divorced by her evil spell people are suffering around her if she know that someone has a job interview or getting married or something good happened to him she do something they don?t get job or they are like failure in their life I am watching this for long time and I can?t tell those people. She told me all of her prayers are accepted. If no one obeys or she dislikes her then their life will be like hell. Can you tell me the dua or anything so I can stop her for destroying other people life she don?t like them. I am feeling quilty and sorry for those people. Please tell me the email address or phone no of any good Sufi or aamil.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf what you are saying is true, then this woman is deceiving you. She cannot be relying on the aayaat of the Qur?aan and Durood to do her sihr (black magic%2Fsorcery). The Qur?aan and Durood are pure forms of thikr, and cannot be used for such evil. She is using some other form of evil to create such effects.%0D%0A%0D%0ASihr is a reality, as mentioned in the Qur?aan. Evil people can and do use sihr to achieve their wicked aims. One who uses sihr leaves the fold of Islam and is no longer a Muslim.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Qur?aan and Sunnah have given us simple prescriptions for protection against sihr. Recite aayatul Qursi, and the last three surahs of the Qur?aan three times each. Then blow onto the palms, and rub the body with the palms as far as one can reach. Do this morning and evening, insha-Allah, one will be saved from the effects of sihr.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe statement that all her prayers are answered is nonsense. She is being deceived by Shaitaan. %0D%0A%0D%0AYou yourself should keep far from this witch.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf you want, you may anonymously tell those people who you feel are the victims of her witchcraft. Recommend the above prescription to them. %0D%0A%0D%0AUnfortunately we do not have an email address of any reliable aamil. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMl.
