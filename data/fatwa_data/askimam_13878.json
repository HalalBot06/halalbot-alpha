  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n My question is regarding the position of a muqtadi when two people are performing salat in Jamat. I always thought that the mugtadi should be little behind the imam like his toes in line with the Imam's ankle. This morning while I was performing Fajr salat with a brother he said no. Muqtadi should be in same line meaning just like in the same safa and he quoted the incident of Ibn Abbas performing witr salat with Prophet SAW when Prophet SAW pulled him from his left and brought to his right. Could you please clarify the issue and provide a reference from hadith.. Jazakallah Khairun\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nA Muqtadi will have to be behind the Imaam in for his Salaat to be valid. He cannot be exactly in line with the Imaam or in front of the Imaam. In that instance, the Salaat will be invalid.\n\nThe incident of Rasoolullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and ibn Abbaas [radhiallaahu anhu] in regarding Tahajjud Salaat in which ibn Abbaas [radhiallaahu anhu] stood on the left side of Rasoolullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] instead of the right side. Rasoolullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] held ibn Abbaas [radhiallaahu anhu] and brought him towards the left. There is no mention of ibn Abbaas [radhiallaahu anhu] being exactly in line with Rasoolullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam].\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
