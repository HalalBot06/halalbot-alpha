  "answer": "QUESTION\nCould you please enlight me on the Fidiya on missed Salaat of a deceased person (a person who has been performing his salaat until he became gravely ill / unconscious prior to his death) What is the Fidiya per salaat? ie what to give, whom to give, how much to give. Jazakallahu Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1.6kg of wheat or 3.2kg of barley or its value should be given to the poor and needy (recipients of Zakaat) for each missed Salaat including Witr. However, if the person remained unconscious for more than 5 Salaats continuously, then there is no Qadhaa or Fidya for that period. (Durrul Mukhtaar vol.1 pg.153; HM Saeed)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
