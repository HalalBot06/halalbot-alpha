  "question": "Your fatwa [no. 13659] suggests that Meelad had justification under certain circumstances",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1.Your fatwa [no. 13659] suggests that Meelad had justification under certain circumstances. Yet, in a recent fatwa you have quoted the hadith wherein you mention that “every innovation is in hell.” Does the said hadith not be applicable to fatwa 13659?\n\n2. Did the Prophet [saw] fast on a Monday because it was the day of his birth? If yes, is this not a commemoration [on his (saw) part] of his birthday?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1.      The life of Rasulullah صلى الله عليه وسلم is an integral path of our Deen. Love for Rasulullah صلى الله عليه وسلم is a means of the perfection of our Deen. Therefore to discuss the life of Rasulullah صلى الله عليه وسلم and educate ourselves on that can never be bidah.\n\nHowever, if one regards celebrating the birth of Rasulullah صلى الله عليه وسلم or regard discussing the different aspects of the life of Rasulullah صلى الله عليه وسلم on particular days of a year to be compulsory, that is indeed bidah.\n\n2.      Rasulullah صلى الله عليه وسلم also used to keep Nafl fast on Thursdays as well and on the 13th, 14th and 15th of the lunar month, irrespective of which days of the week that was. Fasting on Thursday and other days of the week were certainly not due to him celebrating his birthday. Monday was also the day Rasulullah صلى الله عليه وسلم passed away. Should we celebrate the birth of Rasulullah صلى الله عليه وسلم each Monday and also mourn his death each Monday?\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
