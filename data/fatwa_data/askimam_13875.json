  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI wanted to know if somebody ate pork on bread and then gave u papers since u have to work with it and since it is work related and u r not sure if he wiped his hands or say this person did not wipe his hands, will there be something wrong with the paper? due to the fat that might have been transferred, will i have to wash my hands before touching anything else or eating?\n\nÂ If i pick up something, with a tissue and i am not sure what it is, should i assume that it is nothing? should i take the stance that since i dont know what or if is it something that can contaminate, that it is nothing and leave it at that?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere is no need to wash your hands before touching the paper given to you by a person who ate pork. It is not correct to assuume everything as impure until you are certain.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
