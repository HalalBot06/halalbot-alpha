  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamoalaikum Mufti sahab! you have mentioned in your detailed reply for the concept of slave girls that Rasulullah peace be upon Him had slave girls. One was Hazrat Maria Qibtiyya Radhiallahu Anha who was the mother of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam's son, Ibrahim Alayhis Salaam who passed away in infanthood. The others were, Hazrat Rayhaan binte Samoon; Hazrat Nafisa and a fourth, whose name has not been recorded in History. But then at http://www.islam.tc/ask-imam/view.php?q=2476 it is mentioned that the slave girls are supposed to be non-Muslim. so were the aforementioned converted after coming under the Prophet Peace be upon him?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Sayyidatuna Maariya al-Qibtiyyah (Radhiallaahu Anha), had accepted Islam while on journey to Madina. She was sent by al-Muqawqis as a gift for Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) with Sayyiduna Haatib (Radhiallaahu Anhu). Sayyiduna Haatib (Radhiallaahu Anhu) had invited her to Islam while they were on their way to Madina and she had accepted. (al-Isaabah vol.8 pg.310-311)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Sayyidatuna Rayhaana bint Sham?oon (Radhiallaahu Anha) had accepted Islam after being captured by the Muslims. This was because Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) had invited her to Islam. It was only after she accepted Islam that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) chose her as his slave. (Ibid vol.8 pg.146)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. We haven?t come across any details regarding the other two. Moreover, understand that the verdict mentioned on our website merely explains the general manner in which slaves used to be acquired in those days. It, in no way, means that a Muslim cannot be a slave. This also is besides the fact that Islam discourages slavery.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
