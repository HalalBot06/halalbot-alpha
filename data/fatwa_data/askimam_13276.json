  "question": "why Abu Bakar (ra) did not attend the Funeral of the Nabi (saw), even though he was there at the House of Fatima (ra)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease give me the full details of why Abu Bakar (ra) did not attend the Funeral of the Nabi (saw), even though he was there at the House of Fatima (ra) on the day that He (saw) had passed away.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nHadhrat Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq [radhiallaahu anhum] gave the guidance to the Sahaba regarding all the burial proceedings of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. The Sahaba [radhiallaahu anhum] had no experience of the death of a prophet before Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and did not know how to give Ghusl to Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. They also did not know how the Janaza Salaat of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] will be performed and where Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] will be buried.\n\nHadhrat Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq [radhiallaahu anhum] was the only Sahabi who had information about all these issues and he guided the Sahaba [radhiallaahu anhum]. He advised that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] will be given Ghusl with his clothes. He advised that every person will perform Salaat individually and there wonâ€™t be an Imaam for the Janaaza Salaat of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. Again, it was Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq [radhiallaahu anhum] who advised that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] will be buried in the place he had passed away, that is, the house of Hadhrat Aaisha [radhiallaahu anha]. It is, thus, inconceivable that Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq [radhiallaahu anhum] was not at the Janaaza of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam].\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
