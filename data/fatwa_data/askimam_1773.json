  "question": "Is it allowed to cover the forehead with the cloth which is using to cover the head during sujud?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it allowed to cover the forehead completely using the cloth used to cover the head. So that while performing sujud, the forehead will not touch the ground? Will be the salath sahih when we follow the imam who is doing like this? Is it allowed to chew the miswak stick during sawm?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If the head covering (topi) covers the forehead, during sujood, the\nsalaah will be valid.\n2. It is permissible to do miswak during fasting.\n\n\nAnd Allah Ta;ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
