  "question": "Does shaytaan make you lazy in aspects other than deen? For example if you have coursework, shaytaan makes you lazy? If so than why?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. Does shaytaan make you lazy in aspects other than deen? For example if you have coursework, shaytaan makes you lazy? If so than why?\n\n2. If Allah gives someone a huge birth mark on there face or large ears etc, than these people will go through name calling etc, but  Allah has said he has creating everything in proportion, and you should be happy with what Allah has given to you. My point is all the years that person has gone through and even the days he has not been insulted there are still psycholigical feelings. Is this a test from Allah or is Allah saying be happy with what you have.\n\n3. If you nod off for a split second does this invalidate your wude? I know sleeping invalidates your wudu because you do not\nknow if you have broken wind etc, but what about the above situation?\n\n4. Can you listen to music without singing, so a song, but without the lyrics?\n\n5. I was just wondering of this situation islamically. A child comitted sucide because he was bullied in a UK school, all students were under the age of puberty and not muslims. Does the child go hell? And what of the students that bullied him if it was not for them he would not have comiteed suicde.\n\n6. It says on the day of judgment every person will only care about themselves, so what about a mother who deeply regretted abortion, and she is judged between the place of heaven and hell. Will she worried about the baby or just herself?\n\n7.People stay studying school/college/uni is ibadah, how? An and in what way?\n\n8. Is it OK to watch tv (documentaries, etc), and do zikr? The main reason of watching tv/video games is forgetting Allah, so doing zikr stops this problem.\n\n9. When praying behind an imam can you quietly say to yourself things like Allah is great, Al humdulillah etc quietly, for concentration purposes, or is it better just to stare at the place of prostration?\n\nJazakullah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n1)Time is a gift from Allah Ta’ala.It is the essence of life.One should ensure that his time is used correctly and constructively.It is narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbaas (Radiallahu Anhuma) that the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) said: “There are two great bounties of Allah Ta’ala which many people do not give much importance to, good health and free time”. (Tirmizi, Hadith 2304, Ilmiyyah)\n\nShaitaan is the enemy of man.Leave alone the matters of Deen, he will even try to make a person lazy in worldy matters so that one’s time may go to waste.\n\n2)Yes, this is a test from Allah and one should adopt Sabr (patience) in such circumstances.Nabi Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam has said; “No calamity, tiredness, grief, difficulty or hardship befalls a muslim but that Allah Ta’ala expiates his sins even though that hardship he suffers may be to the extent of the prick of a thorn. (Bukhari, Hadith 4641, Darul Fikr)\n\n3)The Wudhu will remain intact if one nods off for a split second. (Raddul Muhtaar, Pg 141, Vol 1, H.M.Saeed)\n\n4)It is not permissible to listen to music at all, be it without singing or lyrics.Similarly it is not permissible to listen to music created by digital sound.\n\n5)A child who did not reach the age of puberty and committed suicide will not go to hell as he is not responsible for his actions.The children who bullied him and were under the age of puberty are not responsible for the child committing suicide although their behaviour was incorrect.\n\n6)On the day of judgment every person will be concerned about themselves.Even a mother who loved her child immensely will be deeply concerned about herself.Allah Ta’ala states in the Holy Qur’aan, “Every being will be concerned about his/her own condition on that day. (day of judgement)\n\n7)If a school, college or university is totally Islamic and none of the laws of Shariah are violated,then attending such institutes may become an act of Ibadah if the intention is correct.\n\n8)It is not permissible to watch TV or documentaries as this entails looking at pictures of animate objects which is Haraam.\n\n9)It is not correct to verbally utter Allah is great and Alhamdulillah while one is engaged in Salaah.Rather one should ponder that Allah is aware of him engaged in Salaah and keep the gaze fixed to the spot of prostration.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
