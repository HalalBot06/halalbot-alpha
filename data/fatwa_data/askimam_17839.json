  "question": "Regarding your below information for a Athiest, i think Bucaille reading are not appropriate. As per the information which i cant confirm he is...",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI read all your fatwas and advices.\n\n \nRegarding your below information for a Athiest, i think Bucaille reading are not appropriate. As per the information which i cant confirm he is drafted the complete presentation after lot of research with many examples but he himlself has not accepted Islam.\n \nSecond in his presentation \"The Bible, the Qur’an and Science’ he says that Darwin evolution theory is supported by quran. Darwin is the biggest athiest and he is first person in the modern science to refute the existence of god. His famous fabricated theory \"Origian of Species\", \"Natural Selection\", \"survival for fittest\", all this theories denies existence of god. His all theories claim that man came in this world by chance.\n \nI think Bucaille presentation should not be forwarded as message of Islam. We have lot of other book which should be taken as example.\n \nAny how i request our Ulamas to investigate more on Bucaille books.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nWe appreciate you writing to us. Hereunder are responses to your concerns.\n\n1) Your first concern is about the faith of Dr Maurice Bucaille. Firstly, you yourself admitted that you can’t confirm that he is not Muslim.\n\nSecondly, only Allah knows the true beliefs and creed of a person that he conceals in his heart; however, by studying the books of Dr Bucaille one can conclude that he believes the Quran to be a revelation from God, and Muhammed (Sallallaahu Alahi Wa Sallam) to be a Prophet of God. Consider the following passages from his book:\n\n“Thanks to its undisputed authenticity, the text of the Quran holds a unique place among the books of Revelation, shared neither by the Old nor the New Testament…\n\nAlso to be underlined is the distinction to be made between the Quran, a book of written Revelation, and the hadiths, collections of statements concerning the actions and sayings of Muhammad. Some of the Prophet’s companions started to write them down from the moment of his death…\n\nThe Quranic Revelation was made by Archangel Gabriel to Muhammad…” (The Bible, the Quran and Science pg. 135-6 )\n\nMoreover, Islam teaches us that words of wisdom are to be taken heed of even if they are uttered by a non-Muslim. Consider the following:\n\nAbu Hurairah (Radiyallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) said, ‘Wisdom is the lost property of a Mu’min. Where ever he finds it, he is most deserving of it (i.e. to act upon it and to benefit form it).’ (Ibn Majah, hadith no. 4159).\nAli (Radiyallaahu Anhu) said, “Look at what is being said. Do not look at who said it.”  (Mirqaatul Mafaatih vol. 9 pg. 403 Rasheediya)\n\nDr Bucaille’s book ‘The Bible, the Quran and Science’ was suggested for the atheist in reference for the following reasons:\n\n1)      The atheist in reference seemed to admire Science and this book specifically proves that all the Quranic verses dealing with Science are in total agreement with the principles of Science.\n\n\n\n2)      The author, just like the atheist in reference, is a westerner. There is a saying amongst the Arabs: الجنس يميل الى الجنس meaning that one is inclined to ones own kind.\n\n\n\n3)      The author of the book does not come from an Islamic background -- he embraced Islam after studying the Quran and confirming its accuracy in regards to the scientific phenomena described therein. For a Muslim to confirm the accuracy of the Quran is not something amazing. However, for an expert in the field of Science, who comes from a non-Islamic background, to confirm that each and every Quranic verse dealing with scientific phenomena is absolutely accurate, is a great marvel in itself and would certainly create zeal, especially in non-Muslims, to explore this infallible and divine book: the Holy Quran. This confirmation should even increase the faith of the Muslims. Tameen Daari (Radiyallaahu Anhu), when he was still a Christian, met Dajjal in an Island and spoke to him. Later on, when he embraced Islam, he informed Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) about his experience with Dajjal. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) gathered his companions and, expressing his joy, told them that he has received confirmation from Tameen Daari (Radiyallaahu Anhu) about the narrations he had related to them regarding Dajjal. (Saheeh Muslim, hadith no. 5235). From this narration we learn that even Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) was delighted when Tameem Daari (Radiyallaahu Anhu) confirmed what Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) already knew through revelation.\n\n\n\n4)      Since the atheist in reference comes from a place where the Christians are the majority, it is highly possible that he became an atheist due to the absurdities of Christianity. It is a fact that a lot of people from Christian backgrounds are becoming atheists. Apart from highlighting the accuracy of the Quran, this book outlines the absurdities of the Bible in light of the established scientific principles. A sensible person would, therefore, conclude that since Bible contains many absurdities, it must altogether be man-made, or at least, contaminated by man, and since the Quran is free from such defects, it must be from God in the pure, uncontaminated form.\n\n2) We could not find where Dr Bucaille supports Darwinism in his book. If you can find it please give us the reference. In fact, Dr Bucaille wrote a book ‘What is the Origin of Man’ in which he refuted the theories of Charles Darwin and the likes. Please see chapter one of the book.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMl.
