  "question": "Would you please comment on the authenticities of the following hadiths, if they are sahih or hasan, who rated or classifed them, and if they are abrogating to other similar hadith.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamu alaikum Mufti Desai, Would you please comment on the authenticities of the following hadiths and elaborate on if they are abrogating or not: 1. Ali (radhiallahu anhu) relates that the sunnah of Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) is to place one hand over the other below the navel. [Abu Daud, ch. on Wad?ul Yumna, Hadith 756] 2. Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud (radhiallahu anhu) said: \"Shall I not show you the manner in which Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) performed his salaah?\" Thereafter he performed the salaah but he did not raise his hands except at the beginning (of his salaah). [Tirmidhi, Hadith no.257] Jazakumallah khairun\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\n1. This Hadith appears only in Ibn al-Arabis’s version of Sunan Abu Dawud.\nImaam Abu Dawud has made some comments regarding the reliability of one of\nits narrators, Abdur Rahmaan ibn Ishaaq al-Kufi. Al-Bazzaar and al-Ajali\n(RA) have clarified that although he suffered from weak memory, his\nnarrations are acceptable. This Hadith also appears in Musnad-e-Ahmad\nregarding which the likes of Suyyuti and Ibn Hajar Haythami (RA) have\nattested to its authenticity. The Hadith of Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu) is\nfurther backed up by the narrations of Abu Hurayra and Anas (Radhiallaahu\nAnhuma), thus, the least that can be said regarding its authenticity is that\nit is Hasan (a level of authenticity slightly lower than that of Sahih –\nhighly authentic). (I’laus sunan vol.2 pg.193; Idaratul Qur’aan)\n2. Imaam ibn Qattaan, Ibn Hazam al-Andalusi as well as Imaam Daaraqutni have\nclassified this Hadith as Sahih (high level of authenticity). (al-Arfus\nShaazi with Tirmidhi vol.1 pg.68; HM Saeed). Imaam Tirmidhi has classified\nit as Hasan. (Ibid pg.59)\nThe Sunnah practises established by the above Ahaadith and others similar to\nthem with slight differences, e.g. placing of hands above or below the\nnavel, etc. have all reached us by way of Tawaatur of Amal, i.e. the\npractise of such a large amount of people in every age that the likelihood\nof falsehood is not entertainable, therefore, the claim of abrogation of any\nis untenable.\n\nand Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
