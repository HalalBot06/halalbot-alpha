  "answer": "QUESTION\nasalamalaikum.  i am a revert to Islam. could you please tell me if it is allowed for me to attend funerals in church of my Christian relatives.  Thank you.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nRespected Brother/sister in Islam\n\nAssalamu alaukum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh\n\nWe do understand the dilemma reverts experience when their non muslim relatives pass away.One one hand, they have a natural feeling for their relatives but on the other hand,they are non muslims and do not want to violate the principles of Islam in associating with non muslim relatives.\n\nIslam has emphasized on family ties.One should maintain ties with all family members to the best of ones ability even though the family members may be non muslims.Islam strengthens ties and does not brake ties.Islam means peace and a muslim should exemplify peace and harmony with whoever he comes in contact with.To maintain family ties with non muslim relatives is a means of Da’wah to them.They will observe the beauty of Islam and be attracted to it.It does not help to be distant from non muslim relatives.Yes, provided one is strong in his Deen and does not compromise.\n\nIf a non muslim relative passes away, one should express his grief and condolences to the bereaved family.He should show his remorse and feel the pain of death of his relative.However, now that he is a muslim, he should also take into cognizance his Islamic values and principles.He should maintain ties and express his condolences without breaking the laws of Shariah.The funeral procedures of non muslims are conducted according to their religion.For example, in Christianity, the horn is blown.Various passages of the Bible are read and devotion to Jesus is expressed.All this is completely contrary to Islam.It is therefore not permissible for a muslim relative to take part in the actual funeral process of ones non muslim relative.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala knows best.\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n A SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n1. When the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\n2. The guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\n\n3. Education and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\n\n4. Islam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\n\n5. When one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\n\n6. Muslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\n\n7. We have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\n\n8. If you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\n\n9. If that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\n\n10. Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, \"When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit\".\n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
