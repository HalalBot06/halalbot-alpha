  "question": "about surah Nisa",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu-alaikum A few months ago, we had a Muslim Student Association book sale. A lot of non-muslims came and asked questions and some of the knowledeable brothers answered questions and they were impressed. However, 1 hindu guy came and directly asekd for an English Qur'aan and asked to open to surah Nisa and asked to goto the verse where it says men is allowed to beat women lightly. Then he argued that Islam says women is a property of man based on this ayah. Mufti saheb, can you please elaborate on the tafseer of this ayah. jazakallah khairun\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe verse in reference does not refer to a woman as the man's property.\n\nThe verse explains how to correct a wife who has been disobedient. Admonish\nher, if she does not change, refuse to share the bed with her and 'lastly'\nbeat her. It is prohibited to beat ones wife in a way that will injure her.\nThat is a last resort. The purpose being to merely jolt her to change.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
