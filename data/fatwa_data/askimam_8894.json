  "question": "marriage and destiny? could you advise me whether evil such as NAZR/JADOO can interfere with destiny",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease could you advise me whether evil such as NAZR/JADOO can interfere with destiny. For example if one is under the influence of such acts (because someone doesnt want something to occur to them-such as marriage), would they still get married regardless? Also if marriage is pre-determined why do some people break engagements/get divorced-is this also pre-determined? jazakallah for your help in this matter.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNazar and Jadoo cannot interfere with destiny. If it is destined for a person to get married he will do so regardless of the Nazar or Jadoo and if it is not destined, then he will not get married regardless of the Nazar and Jadoo. Similarly the Nazar and Jadoo will only influence him if it is destined for him, otherwise not. %0D%0A%0D%0AWhatever good or bad a person is inflicted with is destined for him be it the breaking of engagements or divorce, etc but one does not know as to what is destined for him, therefore he should adopt every possible means to achieve the good and avoid the evil. %0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Ibne Abbas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) states that once he was riding behind the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) when he say: ?O Lad, be watchful over Allah (commandments of Allah) He will be watchful over you. Safeguard his rights; He will be ever with you. If you must beg, beg of Him alone. And remember that if all the people together desire to benefit you, they will be unable to do so except with that which Allah had pre-ordained for you and if all of them intend to do harm to you, they will not be able to do so except with that which Allah had pre-destined against you. The pens have been lifted and put aside and the ink of the book (of pre-destination) had dried up.?
