  "question": "If you don't know you passed gas etc. does your salat count? If you don't know a thing breaks wudu and you've done before must you make up your prayers? Are we counted for what we don't know?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, a person shall be considered in the state of Wudhu until he\nhas full conviction that this Wudhu did not break. (al-Ashbah)\n\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'If a person is confused to whether\nhis Wudhu broke or not, then he should leave the Musjid until he is sure\nthat his Wudhu broke.' (Mishkaat pg.40; Qadeemi)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
