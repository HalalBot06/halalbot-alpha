  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a follower of the hanfi madhab and keep my hands just below my navel.this is the practice followed almost everywhere in india. However recently i read that you have approved that there is no Saheeh hadith supporting this act. please clarify.also i would be grateful if oyu could tell me whats the difference between a Saheeh hadith and other hadiths. Generally people here are of the view that a person can keep his hands below his navel or on his chest. I have also read this fact in my school book. Please clarify.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt has been narrated by Waail ibn Hujr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) that would grasp his left hand with his right hand below his navel.\n\nAllaamah Qaasim ibn Qutloobugha (RA) comments on this Hadith saying, ?It?s chain of narrators is good.?
