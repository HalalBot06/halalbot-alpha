  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSalam, I am happily married for some time now to my husband who is still abroad where we had a large ceremony with many family and friends who attended. Since I have been married I keep getting these doubtful thoughts in one form or another regarding the validity of my nikkah. For instance, a few days ago my mother asked me to ring the opticians on her behalf and cancel something that was on order for my father. So I did this without a second thought and told the lady over the phone, ‘I wanted to cancel such and such for my husband Mr X’ (who is my father offcourse).\n\nMy question is has this statement affected my nikkah in any way? It’s validity? And how can I get rid of such waswas?\n\nAlso when my nikkah was being performed my emotions took over me and began crying for which reason I was unable to repeat word for word what after the person performing my nikkah? Is this acceptable? Does this affect my nikkah in any way?\n\nPlease shed some light on this as it is stressing me out. Your kind words and efforts are greatly appreciated. May Allah swt reward you for your good works.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\n1.      In the first instant where you meant to cancel an order from the optician of your father your referred to your father as husband. This was either done deliberately or by mistake. Whatever was the case, that does not invalidate the nikah.\n\n2.      In the second instance, we understand you represented yourself in your nikah. If you consented to marry your husband, that was sufficient even though you were emotional and did not repeat word by word of the consent to nikah.\n\nOnce you received a ruling of Sharī῾ah, place your trust on the ruling. That will eradicate waswasas and whispers of the Shaitān.\n\n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\n \nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
