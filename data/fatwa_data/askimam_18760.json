The Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) has mentioned the virtues of learning and teaching the Quran:\n\nخيركم من تعلم العلم وعلمه  \n\nThe best among you is he who learns the Quran and teaches it1\n\n \n\n عن  سهل  بن  معاذ  الجهني  عن  أبيه  أن  رسول  الله  صلى  الله  عليه  وسلم  قال: من  قرأ  القرآن  وعمل  بما  فيه  ألبس  والداه  تاجاً  يوم  القيامة،  ضوؤه  أحسن  من  ضوء  الشمس  في  بيوت  الدنيا  لو  كانت  فيكم،  فما  ظنكم  بالذي  عمل  هذا؟\n\nIf anyone recites the Qur'an and acts according to its contents, on the Day of Judgment his parents will be given to wear a crown whose light is better than the light of the sun in the dwellings of this world if it were among you. So what do you think of him who acts according to this?2\n\n \n\nWe learn from this that to be busy memorizing the Quran is an excellent deed and those who are busy with it are the best. In today's times to do the work of the Deen (faith of Islam) is the best. There is no better work for one whom Allah has given knowledge of the deen. There is a great need for Ulema (scholars) today.3\n\n \n\nRemember that Allah is Ar-Raaziq (The Provider) as stated in the Quran:\n\nوَمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ إِلَّا عَلَى ٱللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا\n\nAnd no (moving) living creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allâh. (Surah Hud, 6)\n\n \n\nThere are many, many people with advanced degrees that are unable to find a job. Articles from newspapers around the world reflect this state of the world economy – not only in the current recession but also in previous years. Below are a few examples:\n\n \n\nA recent article in June of 2010 – discusses that “after spending tens of thousands of dollars on higher education, often taking on huge debts along the way, many face a job market that doesn't seem to need them.4” \n\n \n\nIn China – an article discussed how a PhD in biochemistry and molecular biology from China's top agricultural university can't find a job, and has lowered his expectations from the salary that he was initially hoping for: $725 a month. The article goes on to mention how many educated students in China face similar issues.5\n\n \n\nAn older report from 2004 (before the current recession of 2009-2010) showed that job seekers with college degrees have had an especially difficult time finding work, with long-term unemployment for those groups rising by 299.4%.6\n\n \n\nWe should reiterate that these quotes and examples are not to dissuade anyone from seeking secular education. Islam encourages learning and teaching. Rather, the purpose is to show that a secular education is not a guarantee of success. If your child seeks an Islamic education, seeking the pleasure of Allah, he will find contentment of the heart and tremendous blessings with the provision that Allah determines for him.\n\n \n\nYour child has many choices and avenues with regards to his Islamic education. He can go on to teach in an Islamic school, or start an Islamic school. He can work in a publishing house that publishes Islamic books and literature. There is a great need for Islamic teachers and educators today in a wide variety of fields from teaching to publishing.7\n\n \n\nHe can also go on to complete his secular studies if he so chooses and continue to teach and benefit himself, his family and the Ummah with the will of Allah.\n\n \n\nMany parents from diverse economic backgrounds are making their children Huffaz and Ulema. You should encourage your husband, not to miss out on this immensely rewarding Sadaqah-e-Jaariyah.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl.
