  "answer": "QUESTION\n2.My Grandmother missed a few fasts in her young days, in Ramadaan. She is sickly and weak, and will not be able to repay them by fasting, and would like to know if she can repay them in any other way except fasting? E.g.Kaffara\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA very old person who does not have the strength to fast or is very sick and\nhas no hope of recovering should give Fidya for each fast missed in\nRamadhaan. The Fidya for one fast is 1.6 kg of wheat or 3.2 kg of barley or\nthe equivalent of the above in cash or kind.\n\nIt must be noted, however, that should the sick person gain strength or\nrecovers later on, he/she must keep the missed fasts and whatever was given\nas Fidyah will be a reward for him/her from Allah Ta'ala.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
