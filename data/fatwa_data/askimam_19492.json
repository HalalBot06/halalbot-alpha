  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nRespected Mufti Saheb, I would like to know if there are any fazilats of the repeated ayat of Surah Ar-Rahman, “fabi ayyi alai rabbikuma tukazziban”\n\nPlease tell me about this ayaat\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\n{ فَبِأَيِّ آلَاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ }\n\n“Then which of your Lord’s blessings will either of you belie?”\n\nSurah Rahman\n\nThe above verse in Surah Rahman is repeated 31 times. Allah Ta῾ālā enumerates His various bounties to mankind and Jin. He then asks this question “Then which of your Lord’s blessings will either of you belie?” It is obvious we cannot belie the bounties and favors of Allah, since we are surrounded by them at all times. We continuously witness and enjoy the countless favors of Allah in every sphere of our lives.\n\nعن ابن عمر «أن رسول الله صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم َ قرأ سورة الرحمن على أصحابه فسكتوا، فقال: مالي أسمع الجنَّ أحسن جواباً لربها منكم؟ ما أتيتُ على قول الله تعالى {فَبِأَيِّ آلاء رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ} إلا قالوا: لا بشيءْ من نعمك ربنا نكذب فلك الحمد»\n\nIbn Umar radhiyallāhu ῾an says, the Messenger of Allah salallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam recited Surah Rahman to his companions and they were silent. So the Messenger salallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam said, why is it that I have heard the Jin give a better reply than you? Whenever I would come to the verse “Then which of your Lord’s blessings will either of you belie?” they would reply\n\nلا بشيءْ من نعمك ربنا نكذب فلك الحمد\n\n“There are none of your blessings that we deny so praise be to you.”\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\nMawlana Ali bin Cassim\nStudent Darul Iftaa\nLos angeles, CA (USA)\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
