  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know whether there is a difference of opinion regarting how Salaatul Kusuf be performed according to different Madhabs? You mentioned in your Fatwa number 18139 that in each Rak'aat of Salaatul Kusuf there is 1 Ruku and 2 Sajdahs like in a normal salaat, whereas last year when I was in Madinah Munawara just before Ramadhan when there occured an eclipse after Isha salaat and the Imam of Masjid Al-Nabawi  performed Salaah with 2 Ruku in each Rak'aat. Was he praying according to Hanbali school of thought? How should the followers of Shafa'ee madhab pray? And I want to ask that if the Imam of the local masjid is busy, can't anyone else lead the prayers for Salatul Kusuf? Please clarify. Jazakallah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nThere is a difference between the different schools of thought regarding the method of performing Salaatul Khusuf. It is possible that the Imaam of Masjid un Nabawi performed the Salaah in accordance to the Hanbali school of thought.\n\nThe fatwa we had issued was in accordance to the principles of the Hanafi school of thought. We do not issue fatwa according to the Shafi’ school of thought.\n\n If the Imam of the Musjid cannot attend to lead the Salaah, the person most knowledgeable with regards to leading the Salaah after him should be appointed to lead the Salaah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
