  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAslam-o-Aleikum,\n\n1)I want to ask whether greeting some one \"EID Mubarik\" sunnat?\n\n2) Embracing on Eid is sunnat?\n\n\n\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nGreeting someone with “Eid Mubarak” or embracing each other right after Eid Salaah is not established in sunnah. However, there is a leeway to do so outside the Eidgah as long as it would not  be regard it as sunnah. If someone does approach then instead of refusing, one should embrace him and thereafter explain the mas’alah in a polite manner.\n\nNonetheless, one should not regard it as sunnah or even look down at those who abstain from it since that will be bid’ah(Innovation).\n\n(Aap  kay Masail, Vol.2, Pg. 573, Maktabah Ludhyanwi)\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl. Abdur Rahman Shareef,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nConcured by: Ml. Abduz Zaman, Student Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nUnder the guidance of:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai Saheb\nDārul Iftā"
