  "answer": "QUESTION\nI performed one umra and forgot to cut my hair and at night i went to bed with my husband. We did not do intercourse but ofcourse he touched me and fondeled my breast that night. The next day i performed another umra and then when i was cutting my hair, i recalled that i didnt do that (cutting my hair) in my last umra. Could you please tell me what should i do now. I am back in Pakistan now and in case if i have to give dam... how should i do it now as i have heard that it has to be done in the hadood haram.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBy having intercourse or fondling, touching, etc. with desire before cutting\nof the hair necessitates Damm.\n\nAmongst the conditions of Damm is that it has to be slaughtered in the\nHaram. Therefore, you should get into contact with somebody who may be able\nto fulfil this Damm on your behalf in the Haram. (Aalamgiri pat1 pg.244)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
