  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would really appreciate it if you could shed some light on an experience i had today (2 days before eid).  Outside my house on just one part of my house outside my back door, there is a beautiful musk fragrance, not anywhere else in the yard, i have smelt that fragrance once before in a grave yard emitting from a little girls grave.  My breast has been very sore as well for a day now, as if i am breastfeading.  I lost a baby boy when i was 5 months pregnant 2 years ago.  I do have three children Alhumdulilah but not a day goes past when i dont think of my little boy. Does this fragrance of musk mean anything?   Also i used to pray my salaat 5 times a day, for some unknown reason i am become weaker in my imaan and have started to miss a salaat here and there, is there anything i can do/pray to help strengthen my imaan?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nFirst and foremost, we would like to extend our sympathies to you for losing your baby boy. Indeed, it must have been a most traumatizing and saddening event. May Allah reward you for your patience and acceptance of His divine decree. Concerning the smell of musk emanating from part of your house, it is not possible for us to pinpoint with any certainty what its cause was. It is possible that you perceived this smell as a good omen from Allah and its possible that there could be another reason for it. In either case, you should not concern yourself with it too much as there is not much benefit in delving into it. If indeed it was a good omen and sign from the side of Allah, then you should busy yourself in elevating your spiritual status by carrying the injunctions of Allah and involving yourself in remembering and praising Him. If the smell of musk were due to some other reason, there would be no reason to pay special attention to it.   In regards to missing salāh here and there, you should make an all out effort to rectify your condition. Salāh is the pillar of one’s religion.  To increase your enthusiasm for performing salāh  as well as creating the desired fear of Allah Ta‘ālā for leaving out compulsory deeds, we recommend that you set aside a specific portion of the day and read the Ahādith of Rasūlullah صلى الله عليه و سلم compiled in Fadā’il al-A‘māl by Shaykh Muhammad Zakariyyah رحمه الله . This book has proven extremely beneficial for inculcating the desired enthusiasm for carrying out acts of worship. The author has compiled many Ayāt and Ahādith of Rasūlullah صلى الله عليه و سلم in regards to the rewards in store for a person who carries out various actions along with the warnings of neglecting various compulsory injunctions of the Sharī‘ah. Along with this, you should allocate some time of the day to sit in seclusion and ponder about the shortness of this life and the close proximity of one’s demise. Pondering over death, the seriousness of the hereafter coupled with the realization of the worthlessness of the luxuries of this temporary life will be beneficial in increasing your spirituality. May Allah Ta‘ālā increase your zeal for worship and love for Him. Amīn.\n\n\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nMl. Yusuf bin Yaqub,\n\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:"
