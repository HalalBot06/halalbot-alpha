  "question": "What is the kafaraa of speaking lies?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1-I am 17 years old at the moment and i have spoken so much lies,so much that you cannot imagine and i knew this at 9 years old of age that speaking falsehood and lies is a big sin.Alhamdolilah now i have gone for 3 days twice alhamdolilah,and have a niyat of 4 months inshallah.When i gave my O levels examination when i was in 9th class and my age was 14 years old I gave two papers one of \"islamiat\" and the other of \"urdu\" and my grades were then B in urdu and c in islamiat which isnt good.So my class fellows all know my result my parents know the result but when my neighbour friends asked me i told them B in urdu and B in islamiat which is a open lie i mean i told lie in my islamiat grade,and uptil now i am quite sure that i may have told my 150 to 200 neighbour friends this lie.But know after so much time i realized that really this is a sin and know what must i do.I wanted to ask that is there any way that if allah can forgive me in such a way that i may not tell my friends the real results but just say them any other thing otherwise if i told them that this is my result,they would all be very much sad on me because everybody thinks i am a good boy and donot speak lies,and then many of them are also not from tabligh,they would start to say that look these kinds of liars are in tabligh,so please sought out a very easy way in which i could get forgivenes from allah without telling those 150 to 200 friends the real result\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlhamdulillah, you also realise that speaking lies is a major sin and incurs the anger and wrath of Allah. It is the knowledge of the sin and it severity that has made you feel guilty and repent.\n\nIf you are sincere in your repentance and make a firm intention never to repeat the sin, Allah will forgive you. There is no need to inform the friends and neighbours that you spoke lies to them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
