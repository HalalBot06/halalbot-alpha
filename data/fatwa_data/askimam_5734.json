  "question": "If one travels overseas once a month but only stays at a certain place for 7 days then comes back home, then does he have to pray the full rakaats for salaat or is it compulsory for him to Qasr salaat",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nQuestion regarding Qasr Salaat...Salaams. If one travels overseas once a month but only stays at a certain place for about 7 days then comes back home, then does he/she have to pray the full rakaats for salaat or is it compulsory for him/her to pray Qasr salaat. I am asking because i have heard that one has to be staying at a certain place for 15 days or more in order for Qasr Salaat to be compulsory on you, and not less than 15 days.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person undertakes a journey of 88kms or more and he intends to stay at\na place for 15 days or more, then he will not be a Musaafir. He will have to\nperform full Salaat.\n\nQasr will only be performed if he does not intend to stay there for, at\nleast, 15 days. (Hidaaya vol.1)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
