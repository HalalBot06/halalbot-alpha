  "answer": "QUESTION\nSometimes I recite holy quran in my dreams and it happens usually at least once in a month, I recite verses from the open holy quran and most of the time I wake up when I am reciting them in dream, but when I wake up I always feel that I was reciting them in reality and my tongue was moving while sleeping, even I am not a hafiza so how I can recite when I am sleeping as I know verbal only some surahs of 30th parah, but in dreams I am always reciting any other long surah from any other parah which obviously I don?t know verbally, am I reciting wrong surahs?( TobaAstaghfar) or what is this, and why it happens in dream so occasionally.
