  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs-Salaam-u-alaikum, At my local mosque i have noticed that every time the prophets(pbuh) name is mentioned, some people kiss there thumbs then bring their thumbs to their eyes. Could you please explain why they do this? Is there some hadith which mentions this because i have never come across it? Is it recommended that muslims do this? Thankyou for your time. Wasalaam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe aforementioned practice is unfortunately very widespread in different\nparts of the world. Consequently, it has been based on a narration which has\nbeen classified as a fabrication by the masters of Hadith, i.e. Hafiz\nSakhawi (RA) (AlMaqaasidul Hasana pg.450); Hafiz Ibnuddaiba (Tamyeez uthayba\npg.171-2); Hafiz Ibn Taahir al-Fattaany (Tazkiratul Mawdhoo'aat pg.34);\nShaykh Abdul Fattah Abu Ghuddah (footnotes on Al-Masnoo of Mulla Ali Qari\npg.169) and others.\n\nConsidering such an action to be Waajib, Sunnat or as part of Deen is wrong.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
