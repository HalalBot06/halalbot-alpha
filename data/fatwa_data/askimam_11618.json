  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy sister, brother in law and my youngest brother live in VA. USA. They have rented an apartment. They are experiencing an unusual situation there. Like, at night time they feel like some thing is pressing against their neck (feel exhausted and breathlessness). One morning my sister woke up and she found her gold bangles (quite solid and thick though) twisted and deshaped. They all feel the same thing, its getting intense now. Alhumdulillah they all are on taqwa and no TV, music is in the house. SUnnats are practised carefully. What could be done/recited to rectify the situation or they need to look for an amil?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn Ma?ariful Quran of Hazrat Moulana Mufti Muhammad Shafee sahib [ra], it has been mentioned about surah falaq and surah naas, these 2 surats were revealed during the same incidence:%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is stated that a Jew did black magic upon Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam and due to this he fell ill. Angel Jibraeel Alayhis salaam came and informed Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam of this and also let him know that what this black magic was done upon is in (so and so) a well. Men were sent there and they took it out of the well. There were knots in it. Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam opened those knots and regained his health straight away. (even though Jibraeel A notified Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam the name of the Jew who did this, he disliked to take revenge for himself as it was not his habit) and throughout his life he didn?t mention it to the Jew, and if the Jew was present, even then no signs of complaint or irritation were ever shown on Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam blessed face. %0D%0A%0D%0AIn Musnad -Ahmad it has been stated that Nabi?s Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam illness stayed for 6 months.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn Imam Salabi?s narrations, he has mentioned that?the thing which Jaadu was done upon had 11 knots. Allah revealed these surats which consist of 11 ayats. Nabi S would recite one ayat, and simultaneously open one knot, until all the knots opened and suddenly a burden was lifted from our beloved Rasulullah Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt Hazrat Uqba narrates that on a journey Rasulullah Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam recited the muawizatain and then in maghrib namaz he recited both these surats as well, then he said to recite these surats at sleeping time and after you awaken, as well. [nasaee] %0D%0A%0D%0AAnd it is mentioned in another narration that Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam persuaded us to read these surats after every namaz. [Abu dawud, and nasaee]%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Abdullah ibn Habeeb narrates that one night it was rainy and very dark and we went to search for Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam, when we spotted him, Rasulullah Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam said ?say?. I asked what shall I say? He answered qul huwalla ahad (surah ikhlas) and muawizatain (surah falaq and naas), morning and evening recite these 3 times and it will be a protection%2F%0D%0A%0D%0ASafety for you from troubles. [Tirmizi, Abu dawud, nasaee, mazhari]%0D%0A%0D%0AShould read auzu bi kalimatil lahi thaamaati min sharri ma khalaq, always recite this dua at night for nothing can harm one in the night no snake will bite, etc?And the 4 quls [Hadith proving this can be found in ibn majah, page 251, abwabu-thib]%0D%0A%0D%0AAbu Saeed narrates that Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam would ask Allah refuge from jinn?s and insaan (dua) but when the muawizatain (surah-un-naas, & surah-ul-falaq) were revealed he took hold of them and in the place of how he used to seek refuge, he recited these. [ibn majah page 251]%0D%0A%0D%0AIt has been narrated that Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam has said whosoever eats some ajwa khajoor (a certain type of date) for him on that day and night poison and black magic cannot harm him. In another narration it has been mentioned 7 ajwa khajoor. [Kitab-ut-thib in sahih-ul-bukhari, vol.2]%0D%0A%0D%0AManzil%0D%0A%0D%0AIt has been mentioned in a Hadith from Abu laila that I was sitting with Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam when suddenly a person came and said I have a brother in pain. Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam said what is his pain? He replies junoon (madness%2F insanity). Go back and bring him with you. He came and sat in front of Nabi Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam and I heard him recite the following: %0D%0A%0D%0A-tawuz%0D%0A-surah fatiha%0D%0A-1st four ayats of surah baqrah%0D%0A-2 ayats from its middle?wa ilaahukum ilaahu waahid?%0D%0A- ayatul kursi%0D%0A- 3 ayats at the end of surah baqra%0D%0A-1 ayat of surah aal imraan?shahid allahu annahu la ilaha illa huwa?%0D%0A-and recited an ayat of surat-ul-aaraaf?inna rabba kumullahu...%0D%0A-an ayat from surah moumimeen ?wa man yadu maallahi ilaahaan aakara la burhaan lahu bihi...%0D%0A- and an ayat of surat jinn?wa annahu taalaa jaddhu rabbina%0D%0A-and 10 ayats from the beginning of surat-us-saaffaat%0D%0A-3 ayats from the end of surat-ul-hashr%0D%0A-qul huwallahu ahad %0D%0A-and muawizatain%0D%0AHence the person (who was insane) stood up and indeed he was free of it and there was nothing wrong with him (no annoyance). [ibn majah page 254, abwabu-ut-thib]%0D%0AThis is actually the whole manzil and should be recited every night.%0D%0A%0D%0AThings that we should be careful of are:%0D%0A-Bury your hair and nails%0D%0A-Don?t go under the tree after magrib%0D%0A-Women should keep their hair covered especially if they go out at night%0D%0A-Keep ourselves clean%0D%0A-Refrain from going to a place which has been closed for over 40 days%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
