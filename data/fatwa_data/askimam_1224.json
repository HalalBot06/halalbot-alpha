  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssalaamu %C1laykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE RULING REGARDING MASTURBATION%0D%0A%0D%0AMasturbation is Haraam (unlawful).%0D%0A%0D%0AThis is the ruling of the four Madhaahibs viz. Maliki, Shaf%E9e, Hanafee and%0D%0Aone riwaayah (narration) from Imaam Hanbalee. They have drawn their%0D%0Aconclusions from the following proofs:%0D%0A%0D%0APROOFS FROM THE QUR%C3N%0D%0A* Allah Ta%E3la says:%0D%0A'And those who guard their private parts from their wives and those%0D%0A(slave-girls) which their right-hands own - so there is no blame upon them.%0D%0AThen whoever seeks beyond that (which is lawful), they are the%0D%0Atransgressors.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe intended meaning of these Aayat is clear. Allah Ta%E3la has praised the%0D%0Abelievers for guarding their private parts from that which He has made%0D%0Aforbidden for them. Allah has permitted them to approach their wives and%0D%0Aslave-girls. Thereafter, these words of Allah Ta%E3la follow: 'Whoever seeks%0D%0Abeyond that which is lawful are oppressors who overstep from Halaal%0D%0A(permitted) towards Haraam (prohibited).%0D%0A%0D%0AHafiz ibn Katheer (RA) writes Imaam Shaaf%E9e (RA) and those who have agreed%0D%0Awith him have concluded that masturbation is Haraam from this Aayat.' He%0D%0Asays: 'Masturbation is excluded from these two types which Allah has made%0D%0AHalaal, viz. wives and slave-girls.%0D%0A%0D%0A* Similarly, these Fuqahaa (Jurists) have drawn their conclusion from the%0D%0Afollowing Aayat:%0D%0A'And those who do not find the means to marry should remain chaste until%0D%0AAllah gives them resources by His grace.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThis Aayat shows masturbation to be Haraam because of two reasons: Firstly,%0D%0Ain this Aayat Allah Ta%E3la has given the command of chastity and, according%0D%0Ato the principles of Fiqh, a command (an imperative) denotes Wujoob%0D%0A(incumbency, obligation). Hence to remain chaste is Waajib (compulsory) and%0D%0Awherever chastity is Waajib it becomes Waajib to refrain from that which is%0D%0Acontrary to it, for example, adultery, fornication, and sodomy. This is due%0D%0Ato the fact that obligatory chastity will not materialise except by complete%0D%0Arefrainment from all that which is contrary to chastity.%0D%0ASecondly: in this Aayat, Allah Ta%E3la has made chastity obligatory on those%0D%0Awho are unable to execute the command of Nikah. Here Allah Ta%E3la has not%0D%0Adetermined any connection or link between marriage and chastity. Hence, this%0D%0Ademands that masturbation should be Haraam. And if assuming, it was%0D%0Apermissible, then Allah Ta%E3la would have mentioned it at this point because%0D%0Athis was the place of explanation. The silence maintaned by Allah Ta%E3la with%0D%0Aregard to it at a place which requires its explanation, denotes that%0D%0Amasturbation is Haraam.%0D%0A%0D%0AImaam Qurtubi (RA) has written in the Tafseer of this Aayat: 'And when Allah%0D%0ATa%E3la has not determined any order between Nikah and chastity, then this%0D%0Ashows that besides these two, everything else is Haraam. However, this%0D%0AHurmat (unlawfulness) does not include slave-girls because another command%0D%0Aof the Qur%E3n makes them Mubaah (permissible), viz.%0D%0A'That which the right-hands earn (i.e. slave-girls).' Hence, in this manner%0D%0Aan addition of slave-girl has come. Masturbation, however still remains%0D%0AHaraam.%0D%0A'Those who seek beyond this (i.e. wives and slave-girls) are transgressors.'%0D%0A(Ma%E3rij 31)%0D%0A%0D%0AUnder the Tafseer of this Aayat, Qaadhi Thanaullah Paani Patti writes:%0D%0A'Imaam Baghawi has deduced from this Aayat that masturbation is Haraam.'%0D%0A%0D%0APROOFS FROM AHAADITH%0D%0A* Similarly, the Fuqahaa have drawn their conclusion from a Hadith reported%0D%0Aby Abdullah bin Mas%F3od (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) in Bukhari and Muslim. He reports%0D%0Athat Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'O group of youth!%0D%0AWhoever from among you can marry should do so because it keeps the gaze low%0D%0Aand it protects the private parts. And he who cannot marry should make it%0D%0Acompulsory upon himself to fast because it breaks lust.'%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) directed the person who is incapable of%0D%0Abearing the burden on Nikah towards Sawm (fasting). If assuming,%0D%0Amasturbation was permissible, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) would%0D%0Ahave mentioned it at this point. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)%0D%0Ahowever maintained silence. Hence, this indicates that masturbation is%0D%0AHaraam because silence at the place of explanation gives the benefit of%0D%0Arestriction.%0D%0A%0A%0D%0A* Some of the Fuqahaa have drawn their conclusion from a narration reported%0D%0Aby Hasan bin Arfah that Nabi (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'Seven%0D%0Apersons are such that Allah will not look at them on the Day of Qiyaamat nor%0D%0Awill He purify them nor will He include them among the learned and Allah%0D%0Awill enter them into Jahannam. They will enter Jahannam first except for%0D%0Athose who repent. As those who repent Allah will accept their repentance.%0D%0A%0D%0A1. A person who masturbates.%0D%0A2. A person who performs the act of sodomy.%0D%0A3. The person upon whom the act of sodomy is performed.%0D%0A4. A perpetual drunkard.%0D%0A5. The person who hits his parents so much that they appeal for help.%0D%0A6. The person who harms his neighbours so much so that they curse him.%0D%0A7. The person who commits adultery with his neighbour's wife. (Ibn Katheer%0D%0Avol. 5 p. 458)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Anas (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'The person who performs Nikah with his hands (i.e.%0D%0Amasturbates) is cursed. (Tafseer Mazhari vol. 12 p. 94)%0D%0A%0D%0ASAYINGS OF OUR PIOUS PREDECESSORS WITH REGARD TO MASTURBATION%0D%0A* Sa%E9ed bin Jubayr (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'Allah Ta%E3la will inflict a punishment on a group of%0D%0Apeople because they played with their private parts.'%0D%0A* Attaa (RA) says, 'Some people will be resurrected in such a condition that%0D%0Atheir hands will be pregnant, I think they are those who masturbate.'%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta%E3la Knows Best.%0D%0A%0D%0AWas salaam%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
