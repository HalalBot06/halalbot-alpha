  "question": "slave girls will give birth to there masters and sheperds will walk around bare-footed and naked in high buildings",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have heard and read the hadith about one of the signs of Qiyaamah \" slave girls will give birth to there masters and sheperds will walk around bare-footed and naked in high buildings \" something to this effect. Please explain the meaning of this?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nOne authentic explanation for this authentic hadeeth is that children will begin to disobey their parents and dictate over them the way a master does to his slaves. It will seem as though a mother has given birth to her own master, judging by the way she will be treated by her children.\n\nThe second part of the hadeeth states that you will find villagers and and other poor people will now have so much wealth that they will be enjoying themselves in palaces and competing with each other in building towers.\n\nÂ \n\nReferences: Fathul Bari; Sharuh Nawwawi Ala Muslim\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
