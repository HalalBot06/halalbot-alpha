  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am Alhamdolilah now very much interested in getting deeni knowledge but now my studies performance have gone very very low and i didnt got good grades in my O levels,because of which my mother has started to blame tabligh,that i sit in the biyaans,i gave time to the masjid for Ghusst and etc..I have seen many of my friends who even not offer their prayers but their worldly studies are brilliant.So why is this,What is the cause.I have a firm intention to inshallah become an Aalim but if i would be a duffer in worldly studies just then my parents would be discouraged and now if i got inshallah good grades in my A levels then inshallah it would open good paths for me to become Aalim and my mother and father both would be very much happy because of me.So how can i become a brilliant student in worldly studies?Please tell me guaranteed ways for becoming a brilliant student in my all studies and how to get distinction in my any one of the subject of A levels,I have taken (Biology,Chemistry and Maths) and please also do pray for me and ask your all staff also to pray for me.May Allah bless you and all your staff who are working so hard to settle all peoples matters.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou enquire from us the cause of you not performing well in your studies. That is something which you know better. Your friends producing good results is certainly not because of not performing Salaat. One should work hard to produce good results.\n\nNothing can be usually achieved without devotion and dedication. However, performing Salaat and fulfilling other religious obligations does not hinder one from hard work, devotion and dedication. Surely, one requires time for meals, rest and attending to other natural causes. Similarly, one should study hard but also fulfil one?s religious obligations as well. If your parents observe that you are not working as hard as you should, then you should consider their observation and work harder.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
