  "question": "Does touching and kissing break the Wudhu?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf my husband and I have just completed our Salaah or if my husband comes home from work and i have wudoo and he holds my hand, touches my face or gives me a kiss on the cheek, is my / our wudoo invalid? Do we have to reperform our wudoo for the next Salaah? Jazaakallah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAccording to the Hanafi mazhab, a male (including husband and wife) touching each other does not invalidate wuzu.\n\nÂ \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
