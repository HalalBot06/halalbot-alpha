  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. What is the difference between something that is Sunnah and something that is Fard? 2. Is having a beard a Fard? 3. Does one Muslim have the right to propogate the Sunnah he practices on the Jammat?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The terms Fardh and Sunnah are academic terms with specific definitions which was introduced by the Fuqahaa (jurists) which also serves as a guide to determine the different levels of authenticity of an act.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Refer below%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Your question is not clear. However, the Qur?aan and Ahaadith are replete with orders to adhere to the Sunnah. To promote one Sunnah is equivalent to the reward of 100 martyrs in the path of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AImaam Bukhari (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports on the authority of Naafi' who narrates from Abdullah ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Oppose the Mushrikeen (polytheists); lengthen the beard and trim the moustache.' %0D%0A%0D%0ANaafi' further states, 'And ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) during Hajj or Umrah used to hold on to his beard with his fist and cut off whatever was in excess of that.' (Bukhari vol.2 pg.875; Kitaab-ul-Libaas) %0D%0A%0D%0AThrough this Hadith, the verdict of the growing of the beard being Waajib (obligatory) is deduced. That is because any explicit command of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) will be regarded as Waajib, if there is no apparent, clear reason%2Fproof which states that that particular command is for Istihbaab (preference). This is an established fact in Usool-ul-Fiqh (principles of jurisprudence). %0D%0A%0D%0AMoreover, the Wujoob is further emphasized by the fact that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) did practice on this in his entire life. Know well that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) did not trim his beard in his life (there is no Sahih Hadith which proves otherwise). However, because the narrator himself (Ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) did trim his beard upto a fist's length, this implies that the Wujoob of keeping a beard is up to a fist length only. %0D%0A%0D%0AFurthermore, such has also been reported from Sayyiduna Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) and other Taabi'een. (Tamheed of ibn Abdul-Barr and Fathul Baari). Therefore, the meaning of our statement that you question is, 'If any person has trimmed his beard upto less than one fist, then his beard will not be a Shar'ee beard.' %0D%0A%0D%0ALastly, for your knowledge, the sayings and actions of the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) is a Hujjah (proof) according to the majority of the scholars. However, the conditions for acceptance may differ. This is also an established principle in Usool-ul-Fiqh. Hence, the refutation of a Shar'ee beard by the scholar you have mentioned does not hold any weight in front of the Shar'ee proof we have mentioned."
