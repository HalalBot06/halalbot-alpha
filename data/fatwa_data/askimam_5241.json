  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Respected Imam My husband left me 3 months ago as he is involved with another woman. so I was waiting for him and he did not return. So I prayed Isthikhara for 7 days and then I waited for couple of weeks but there were no signs. Then applied for FASAH as I did not have any option. We have to appear in courts next month. Now I feel that I need to live with him again ? I'm confused. What's the outcome of Istikhara ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is difficult to explain to you what is the outcome of the Istikhaara. You\nfeel the need to reconcile but he is not interested as he did not return.\n\nYou cannot continue your life like that. We advise you appoint a\nrepresentative to discuss the issue with your husband and express to him\nyour feelings. You can decide only after he responds.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
