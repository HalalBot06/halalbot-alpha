  "question": "I am a college student, studying away from home. When I suggested to my mother that I might want to eat less and fast more, she said no, and she was upset. Should I listen, or do it and not tell her?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn general, there are certain points about following the Sunna that my mother is not comfortable with. For example, she prefers me to pray Fajr at home instead of at the Masjid when I come home for holidays (because she likes knowing I am in the house). I love her very much and I want to do my best to please her, but at the same time I want to improve my character according to Islam. What do you advise? Jazak Allah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n%0D%0AYour attitude to please your mother to the best of your ability is highly%0D%0Acommendable as it is an act of great virtue. We advise that you discuss with%0D%0Ayour mother the importance of males performing Salaat in the Musjid.%0D%0A%0D%0AProbably, she is not acquainted with its importance and therefore she gets%0D%0Aupset. Refer below on the importance of performing Salaat in Jamaat.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs regards keeping Nafl fasts. You should be moderate. First consider your%0D%0Ahealth. If you have no health concerns, then you may keep the Sunnah fasts%0D%0Aof only two times a week (Mondays and Thursdays). If that affects your%0D%0Astudies and your daily work, then preference should be given to your basic%0D%0Aresponsibilities over keeping Nafl (voluntary) fasts.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Salaat in the Musjid with the Jamaa`h, according to the terminology of%0D%0Athe Fuqahaa (Jurists) is Sunnah Muakkadah (emphasised Sunnah ), thus, if a%0D%0Aman does not go to the Musjid for Jamaa`h and offers Salaat at home without%0D%0Aa valid Shar'ee excuse, for example, illness, rain, etc. his prayer will be%0D%0Avalid, but incurs the displeasure of Allah Ta'ala for having neglected a%0D%0Agreat Sunnah. (Ma'ariful Qur'aan vol.1 pg.216)%0D%0A2. If a person hears the Adhaan, it will be Waajib for that person to%0D%0Aperform Salaat with Jamaat.%0D%0A3. If a person is unable to perform Salaat with Jamaa`h because of his work%0D%0Asituation, he should look for an alternate employment where he will be able%0D%0Ato perform his Salaat with Jamaa`h. A person in university must try to%0D%0Aperform Jamaa`h with his colleagues after the lessons.%0D%0A%0D%0AImportance of Salaat%0D%0A`Iqaamah` does not refer to merely performing Salaat. Aside from exercising%0D%0Adue care in the performance of the fardh, wajib and Mustahab actions of%0D%0ASalaat, `Iqaamah` also includes constancy and punctuality in Salaat. (Ma'%0D%0Aariful Quraan Vol.1 Pg.111)%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammed Shafi' Saheb (R.A) writes: \"An eminent group of the Sahaba,%0D%0ATa'abieen and the Jurists are of the opinion that Salaat with jamaat is%0D%0Acompulsory and to omit it is a sin. In fact a group among the Sahaba negate%0D%0Athe validity of the Salaat performed individually without a valid Shari'%0D%0Aexcuse. (Ma'ariful Quraan)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Ahaadith are replete with warnings for those who deliberately (without a%0D%0Avalid Shari' excuse) forego Salaat with jamaat. In one Hadith Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said: \"By that Being who%0D%0Ahas control over my life, I intend gathering some firewood. I would then%0D%0Ainstruct somebody to call out the Azaan and perform the Salaat while I go%0D%0Aand set fire to the homes of those people who perform their Salaat in their%0D%0Ahouses without any proper excuse.\" (Sahih Bukhari Vol.1 Pg.89)%0D%0A%0D%0AAnother Hadith declares: \"Had it not been for the women and children, I%0D%0Awould have had someone perform the Salaat and instructed some of the%0D%0Ayoungsters to go and burn down their homes.\" (Mishkaat Pg.97 from Musnad%0D%0AAhmed) In yet another Hadith Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is%0D%0Areported to have said: \"The most difficult Salaats on the hypocrites are%0D%0AEsha and Fajr. However, had they known the reward of performing those Salaat%0D%0Awith jamaat, they would have performed them even if they had to crawl to the%0D%0AMusjid.\" (Sahih Bukhari Vol.1 Pg.90)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn a narration of Abu Dawood, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is to%0D%0Areported to have said: \" He who hears the azaan but fails to go the Musjid,%0D%0Awithout a valid (Shari') excuse, the Salaat that he has performed (at home)%0D%0Ais not accepted.\" Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was asked: \"What%0D%0Ais a valid excuse?\" He replied: \"Illness or fear.\" (Mishkaat Pg.97)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe illness and fear mentioned above refers to such fear and illness that%0D%0Aactively prevents one from joining the congregation for Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0AOnce a blind man came to Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and said:%0D%0A\"O Rasul of Allah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), I have no guide. Can I%0D%0Aperform my Salaat at home.\" Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Apermitted him to do so. When the blind man turned to leave, Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) called him back and asked: \"Can you hear the%0D%0Aazaan (at home)?\" He replied in the affirmative. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) then said: \"In that case you must attend the jamaat%0D%0A(regardless of your situation).\" (Sahih Muslim Vol.1 Pg.232)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe sheer importance of jamaat is clearly highlighted in this Hadith. How%0D%0Acan the lacksadaisical attitude which we entertain in this regard be%0D%0Atolerated!?%0D%0A%0D%0AIbn Masood (Radhiallaahu Anhu) says; \"The one who wishes to meet Allah%0D%0ATa'ala as a Muslim on the day of judgement, should be punctual in the%0D%0Aperformance of his Salaat on hearing the azaan. Allah Ta'ala has prescribed%0D%0Athe clear ways of guidance for his Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0AThese Salaat too are among those ways of guidance. If you too will adopt the%0D%0Away of those who perform their Salaat at their homes, you will be abandoning%0D%0Athe way of Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), hence you would be led%0D%0Aastray. The one who performs wudhu and leaves for the Musjid, for every step%0D%0Ahe takes he gets one reward, one of his sins are forgiven and his stages are%0D%0Aelevated in Jannah. In the time of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Aonly an open hypocrite would not join the jamaat. Even the sick person would%0D%0Abe carried by two people and brought to the Musjid to perform his Salaat%0D%0Awith jamaat. (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0ALet us read these authentic Ahaadith repeatedly and let us then reflect upon%0D%0Athe condition of the Ummah. These Ahaadith should imbibe within us a strong%0D%0Awill to make an all-out effort towards self-rectification as well as towards%0D%0Aattempting to improve the condition of the Ummah, the first and immediate%0D%0Afocus of our efforts being our families.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhile the warnings are severe for neglecting Salaat with jamaat, likewise%0D%0Athe rewards for performing Salaat with congregation are also tremendous.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Salaat performed with jamaat is twenty seven times more superior than%0D%0Athe Salaat performed individually. (Sahih Bukhari Vol.1 Pg.89) Similarly,%0D%0Athe one who performs his Esha Salaat with jamaat gets the reward for having%0D%0Aspent half the night in ibaadat(worship). If he then performs his Fajr%0D%0ASalaat with jamaat, he gets the reward for spending the entire night in%0D%0Aibaadat. (Sahih Muslim Vol.1 Pg.232) A little effort will not only save one%0D%0Afrom the excruciating punishment of the hereafter but will also earn one%0D%0Agreat reward.%0D%0A"
