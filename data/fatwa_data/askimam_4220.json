Salam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBefore answering your query, we advise you to immediately severe every type%0D%0Aof relationship with the girl. Adultery invites the anger and wrath of%0D%0AAllah. You and the girl should exercise restraint and sincerely repent to%0D%0AAllah. One can never attain peace and happiness while violating the orders%0D%0Aof Allah. It is the month of Ramaddan and an ideal opportunity to repent and%0D%0Achange your vision and approach to life. As regards to marrying the girl,%0D%0Athe blessings of her parents is important for her personal peace and%0D%0Ahappiness. She should discuss the matter with her parents and openly explain%0D%0Aher feelings towards you. She and her parents should make Istikhara (seek%0D%0Adivine guidance) as well as make Mashura (consult) responsible people in%0D%0Amaking a decision. You should also do the same. The girl should apply wisdom%0D%0Aand diplomacy in conveying to her parents the Islamic procedure of Istikhara%0D%0Aand Mashura in making a decision.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
