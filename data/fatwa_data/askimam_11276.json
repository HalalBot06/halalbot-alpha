Is it permissible? May Allah supports each muslim being one for his good deeds Ameen salam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is permissible to do any acts of charity, for example, recite the Qur?aan, give charity, perform Nafl Salaat, etc. and give the reward to the person alive or a person who passed away.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. It is permissible for you to perform Nafl Salaat and give the reward to your husband. However, that will not absolve your husband from performing his daily Fardh Salaats. Advise your husband to perform his 5 daily Salaat wherever he is. Make Du?aa to Allah to grant him such employment where he can practise on Deen easily. Also make effort in searching for an alternate employment. May Allah make that easy for him, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Sister, may Allah accept your concern of Deen for your family members. This very concern is an act of Ibaadat. Our responsibility is to invite our family, friends and associates to Islam and practise Islam. In order to make that as effective as possible, maintain good family ties and show your love and concern for all the people around you. Show them care and be compassionate. It is natural that their hearts will be inclined towards you. They will love you. You continue doing acts and deeds of piety and they will observe you. Advise them also to be Allah conscious, remind them of death, life after death and also make Du?aa to Allah for them. Allah will create such conditions that they will realise and change their lives. You have to make a concerted effort and be patient.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. We do not know what you mean by Shakuk. Nevertheless, recite ?Yaa Wadoodu? as much as possible. That will increase mutual love.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Allah is most merciful. He does not need to avenge disobedience to Him. His mercy is more than his anger. Making Du?aa to Allah to forgive your husband is sufficient. You don?t have to take your husband?s sins on your shoulders and neither is that permissible. Allah Ta?ala states, ?No one will bear the burden of another?.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
