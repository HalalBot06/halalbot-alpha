  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ndue to difficult family probs I had takenloans from banks.I am finding it very difficult to repay bcos my income is not sufficient.Am I answerable on the day of judgement if I do not repay?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nShari’ah has emphasised on the rights of creditors. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] would not perform the Janaaza Salaat of a person who did not pay his debts or leave money for his debts to be paid. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘If a person has been given three lifespans and each lifespan he spent in the path of Allah and became a martyr, his sin of not paying his debt will not be forgiven.’\n\nYou should make an intention to pay your debt and every possible effort in that regard.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
