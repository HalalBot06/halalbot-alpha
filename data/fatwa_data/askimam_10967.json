  "answer": "QUESTION\nAnother Question is a friend of mine is asking me that if Islam is the Din of Nature then why women are not allowed to marry more than once and why they are not promosied more than one men in Jannat? As I am fail to explian him this is not nature of woman but he says he witnessed many ladies wanted more than one men and this is nature? 2. My another question is according to which Fatwa Unsluaghter Chicken eating in USA is halal and can we eat so? is it permitted by which fiqh?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) The position of an Imaam is a very lofty one. Rasulullah (Salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam) was the Imaam for the Sahaabah throughout his life. An Imaam carries out this Sunnah of Rasulullah (Salla Allahu alayhi wa Sallam) and is the deputy of Rasulullah (Salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam) in this lofty position. Rasulullah (Salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam) said, ?Whoever performs Salaah behind a pious Imaam, it is as though he has performed Salaah behind a Nabi. (Nasbur-Raayah Zaylaee). The Fuqahaa have ruled that it is Makrooh (reprehensible) to perform Salaah behind a Faasiq. Any person who violates the laws of Shariah is a Faasiq and to perform Salaah behind such a person is Makrooh. The shaving of the beard or trimming it within the length of ones fist is a sin. Such a person is a Faasiq and it is Makrooh to perform Salaah behind such a person.%0D%0A%0D%0A2) The religion of Islam is a religion of submission to the orders of Allah. A Muslim is expected to express slavery to the orders of Allah Subjugation to the will of Allah is the motto and mission of a true believer. Islam is not primarily about meeting the demands of nature. If that was the case then a human being by nature is prone to freedom and unrestricted choices. The question then posed regarding the nature of women will also feature in the case of men, as they are restricted to only four women with strict conditions. The question will also feature regarding children and youth as well. The unrestricted movement and passion of human beings can never be successful anywhere in the world, even in the western and democratic governments of the world. In fact, the freedom granted to them has caused a huge burden for them. Islam permits a woman to marry only one man at a time. If she is divorced or becomes a widow, she is free to remarry to fulfil her natural demands. It is also against feminine nature to cope with two or more men at once. This feminine nature has been considered by Shariah, hence the law and rule. As regards a females position in Jannah, the entire question is based on fulfilment of wishes and desires. Jannah is a place of fulfilment. No person will ever complain of non-fulfilment there. That includes a female.%0D%0A%0D%0A3) It is not permissible to eat any unslaughtered chicken. Such chicken will be Haraam. According to Shariah a chicken is only Halaal only if it is slaughtered by a Muslim who recites the name of Allah before slaughtering the chicken.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
