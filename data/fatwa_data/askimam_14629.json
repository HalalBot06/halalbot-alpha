The Darul Ifta has adopted a transaction to transaction approach regarding the dealings of Albarakah Bank. We cannot issue a blanket ruling regarding the Shariah compliance of all the dealings of Albarakah Bank. If anyone wishes to deal with Albarakah Bank, he may enquire the details of the deal and official documentation of the transaction and forward it to us for advice.\n\n \n\n2)     The Oasis Equity Crescent Fund deals in shares. The concept of shares in a stock exchange is different from the concept of shares in Shariah. Oasis Crescent Fund and other shares investment schemes do not meet the conditions of partnership and shares in Shariah. In Islamic business and economics, the share holders in a partnership must bear full liability of the debts of the company. That is generally not so in conventional share investment schemes. The partners liabilities are limited.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
