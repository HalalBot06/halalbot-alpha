  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nA Muslim is running a lodge/hotel on a 5 year lease from the government. The lodge is only his for the duration of the lease. He charges for full board accomodation and all other services. He does not provide or supply any form of Alcohol. However, some clients bring their own Alcohol or orgainise their own alcohol and consume it during their stay. Does this have any affect on his income.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIf the Muslim owner does not provide any alcohol, but some people bring their own anyway, then this will not affect his income.  His income will still be halāl.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
