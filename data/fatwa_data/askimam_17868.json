  "question": "Javed Ahmed Ghamidi and his views",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1.what are views about javed ahmed ghamidi . he is known for his moderate views which are in direct conflict with todays ulama. specially his views about music and the beard .if the beard is so important , why didnt allah mention it in the quran. similarly if listening to music is indeed a grave sin then why didnt allah mention it in the quran. why would allah put us in doubt or play games with us\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nBefore answering the query, it is important to mention that one should be extremely careful and cautious before uttering any statements. It is incorrect and sinful to state that Allah Ta’ala is putting us in doubt and is playing games with us. Allah Ta’ala is Most-Knowledgeable and Wise and is perfect in all of His qualities. It is necessary for you to make sincere tawbah and istighfaar and vow to never utter such statements again.\n\nIf one is unsure about something regarding the Deen, it is necessary to refer to the ‘Ulama as this is a clear command of Allah Ta’ala in the Holy Quran:\n\nفاسألوا أهل الذكر إن كنتم لا تعلمون\n\n\"And ask the people of knowledge if you do not know.\" (16:43, 21:7)\n\nTherefore, we advise you to follow this step before uttering dangerous statements from one’s own mind.\n\nAs far as the query is concerned, we are unaware of Javed Ahmed Ghamidi. However, if his views include the permissibility of music and not keeping the beard, then this clearly contradicts the injunctions of the Holy Quran and Sunnah of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nBefore mentioning the Shari’ee rulings on music and the beard, it is necessary to mention that only the basic principles concerning Deen are explained in the Holy Quran. One of the reasons Allah Ta’ala chose Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) as a Messenger was that he can fully explain the Holy Quran for it to be understood and implemented properly. For example, it is stated in the Quran to observe salat and pay zakat, but in no place does it mention how to carry out these acts, meaning how to observe the salat and how much zakat to pay. It was the Ahadith and the example of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) which clarified the injunctions of the Quran and other matters.\n\nAlthough the command of growing the beard is not clearly mentioned in the Quran, it is clearly mentioned in the Hadith of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam). Allah Ta’ala clearly states in the Quran that it is incumbent upon all of us to follow the commandments of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) and his Sunnah and that the one who has followed his Sunnah has indeed obeyed Allah Ta’ala:\n\nمن يطع الرسول فقد أطاع الله  \n\n“Whoever obeys the Messenger has surely obeyed Allah” (4:80)\n\nقل إن كنتم تحبون الله فاتبعوني يحببكم الله ويغفر لكم ذنوبكم والله غفور رحيم\n\n“Say O Prophet): If you really love Allah, then follow me, and Allah shall love you and forgive your sins. Allah is Most-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.” (3:31)\n\nThat being said, there are clear Hadith indicating to lengthen the beard and trim the mustache (listed in the article below). Moreover, the Fuqahaa have declared it wajib to grow the beard. Hereunder is a detailed answer on the Shari’ee status of the beard:\n\nhttp://al-inaam.com/dhadith/sbeard.htm\n\nRegarding the prohibition of music, Allah Ta’ala mentions in the Holy Quran:\n\nومن الناس من يشتري لهو الحديث ليضل عن سبيل الله بغير علم ويتخذها هزوا أولئك لهم عذاب مهين\n\n“From amongst men there are those who purchase ‘lahw al hadith’ without knowledge, to mislead from the Path of Allah and they ridicule it. For them there is a humiliating punishment” (31:6)\n\nThe following great Commentators state that ‘lahw al hadith’ in the above verse refers to music….\n\na) Abdullah ibn Mas‘ûd radiyallâhu ‘anhu\n\nb) Jâbir ibn ‘Abdillah radiyallâhu ‘anhu\n\nc) Abdullâh ibn ‘Abbâs radiyallâhu ‘anhu\n\nd) Hasan al-Basrî rahimahu Allah\n\ne) Ikrimah rahimahu Allah\n\nf) Ebrahim an Nakhi rahimahu Allah\n\ng) Maymoon bin Mahran rahimahu Allah\n\nh) Qatada rahimahu Allah\n\ni) Sa‘îd ibn Jubayr rahimahu Allah\n\nj) Mujâhid rahimahu Allah\n\nk) Amr ibn Shu`ayb rahimahu Allah\n\nl) Ali ibn Badhîmah rahimahu Allah\n\nm) Habeeb rahimahu Allah\n\nn) Makhûl. rahimahu Allah\n\no) Abd al Kareem rahimahu Allah\n\np) Ibn Zakhr rahimahu Allah\n\nq) Ataa al Khuraasaani rahimahu Allah\n\n \n\nThe two greatest commentators of this Ummah, Abdullah bin Masood and Abdullah bin Abbaas (radiyallâhu ‘anhuma), used to take an oath and say that this verse refers to music.\n\n(Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah 5/132, Al Mustadrak lil Hakim 2/211, Sunan al kubra lil Bayhaqi 10/223, Ad Durr al manthoor 8/76, Al Hawi al Kabeer 17/388, An Nukat wal uyoon 3/332, Tafseer Ibn Katheer 6/330, Tafseer al Qurtubi 14/52, Tafseer al Baghwi 6/283, Tafseer al lubaab libni Adil 13/10, Tafseer al Khaazin 5/145, Tafseer at Tabari 20/127, Zad al maser 5/105, Ma’arif al Quraan 7/28, Dhamm al malahi 5-6, Ahsan al fatawa 8/380)\n\nHereunder is our detailed research on the prohibition of music:\n\nhttp://al-inaam.com/fataawa/music_detailed.htm\n\nThe abovementioned articles have made the necessity of growing the beard and the impermissibility of music clear. Those who go against these rulings have clearly gone against the injunctions of the Quran and Sunnah. Therefore, it is important to stay away from those who have views against these rulings for keeping in their company will lead one astray. One should remain in the company of those ‘Ulama who are strict in following the Sunnah, as they will InshaAllah guide us on the right path.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
