  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy wife and I have been married for 3 years. Her mother has not been married since before our wedding. Her mother has suggested that she would like to make Hajj next year, and she would like me to accompany her. Is it permissible for me to make Hajj with my mother-in-law?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nA mother-in-law is a mahram (prohibited in marriage). It is permissible for the son-in-law to serve as a mahram for the mother-in-law on condition there is not fear of fitnah between them two.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
