  "question": "First, May Allah reward you on the good work you brothers are doing. Inshallah. Now here is my question. Keeping a beard is not wajib?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI had a conversation with my family regarding the beard issue and the point came up that you only get gunnah when you have set your intentions to keep the beard, and you cut or trim the beard for no righteous purpose. Does this mean that keeping a beard is not wajib and it is not against shariah and the sunnat of prophet mohammed [May ever lasting peace be upon him]. True or false? Please explain with proof. JazakAllah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n'For Muslim males to grow a beard is Waajib (compulsory), and to let it grow\na fist length is Waajib. Without any Shar√©e reason to cut or shave is Haraam\n(totally prohibited). He who does so is a Faasiq (sinner) and to shorten it\nless than a fist length is Makruh Tahrimi (near Haraam).' Dari Aur Ambiyaa\nKi Sunnate, Mufti Saeed Palanpuri.\n\nShar'ee Length of the Beard:\nhttp://www.jamiat.org.za/isinfo/s_beard.html\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
