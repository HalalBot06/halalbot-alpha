  "answer": "QUESTION\nI'm supposed to change my name and I like Aanisah would it be correct, though I found it on www.alinaam.org.za. And it has a very beautiful meaning. I would also like to ask u, what I can do to be more steadfast in reading salaah. And is there any hadith saying something good about naats, I mean, is it ok to listen to naats in urdu? I appreciate your help\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Yes, it would be correct and preferable to change your name to%0D%0AAanisah. To become more steadfast in Salaat, you should read those Ahaadith%0D%0Awhich explain the great virtues and rewards for Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. It is permissible to listen to Urdu Naats, if it doesn't have any%0D%0Amusical elements in it.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. To be more steadfast in Salaat, you should ponder over the great%0D%0Arewards of Salaat, e.g. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, That%0D%0Aperson who reads Fajr and Asr will never enter Jahannum. Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) also said in a Hadith, 'That person who reads%0D%0Ahis 5 times daily Salaat, 5 things will be more easy for him: a) His daily%0D%0Asustenance, b) He will be saved from punishment of the grave, c) He will%0D%0Across the Pul Siraat (bridge over Jahannum) easily, d) He will be given his%0D%0Abook of deeds in his right hand, e) He will enter Jannah without reckoning.%0D%0A%0D%0AInsha Allah, if you ponder over these and many other great rewards for%0D%0Aperforming Salaat, you will become steadfast.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
