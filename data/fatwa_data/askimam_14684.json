  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nRespected Mufti Saheb\n\nQuestion in relation to the Husband allowed to retaliate with wife..i.e. If over argument wife will not be quiet - husbans gets irritated - states her to be quiet but she never listens - is he allowed to hold her hand with force - slap her or push her on to the bed - so she undertsands that she needs to shut up? what is the shariah regrding this?No physical harm is intended - but I know it is still not right slapping or pushing someone to shut them up..!\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram\n\n \n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\n \n\nIf the wife does not keep quiet during an argument, the husband should keep quiet and move away from the wife. he cannot slap or push her in order to keep her quiet. In that instance, his intention would not be to reform the wife but to prevail over her in an argument. A man is emotionally stronger than women. The husband should contain himself and overlook the wife’s outburst during an argument.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
