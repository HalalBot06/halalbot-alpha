  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni would like to ask you about using modern contraceptive methods to prevent the child birth. being a muslim me and my wife agreed to use modern contraceptive methods to prevent child birth. is it permissible or not?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh  \n\nPlease see below our standard response.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n \n\nDarul Iftaa\n\n \n\nCONTRACEPTION\n\nReversible\n\nChemical - the pill which is taken orally spermicidal jellies used locally. Mechanical - use of condom intra-uterine device Physical - coitus interruptus rhythm method Permanent - sterilization operation - tubal ligations - vasectomies.\n\n \n\nQuestion 1\n\nIs the Practice of contraception allowed in Islam? If so, under what circumstances?\n\nAnswer\n\nContraception is permissible on a limited scale for valid reasons - reasons considered by the Shariلh to be valid. The circumstances which will permit reversible and permanent contraception differ.\n\n \n\nREVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTION\n\nAmong the reasons accepted by the Shariلh as valid for practising reversible contraception are:\n\n(A)   Physical weakness.\n\n(B)    Sickness.\n\n(C)    The wife maintaining her beauty or figure for the sake of her husband.\n\n(D)   The couple being on a journey or in a distant land.\n\n(E)    Adverse political conditions, e.g. children are forcibly separated from their parents as is advocated by communism; etc.\n\n(F)    The couple decide to separate in the near future.\n\n(G)   The wife is an immoral person.\n\nThere are valid grounds for practising reversible contraception. Poverty or the fear of poverty are not valid reasons for contraception. It is not permissible to practice contraception on account of a fear of not being able to provide for a large family. Such a fear is an attribute of non-Muslims. According to the Qurمn Shareef: 'There is not a living creature, but its sustenance is the responsibility of Allah.'\n\nSimilarly desire to curb sexual desire which may stem out of piety is not a lawful ground for contraception. If practised for any reason which is unlawful in Islam, then contraception will likewise be unlawful, e.g. for indulgence in illicit sex.\n\nPERMANENT CONTRACEPTION\n\nPermanent contraception is permissible only if the woman's life is in danger or her health is seriously threatened.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
