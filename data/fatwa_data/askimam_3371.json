  "answer": "QUESTION\nShukran\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nKindly refer below our standard reply to similar queries.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nQ: A woman covers her head with a white see-through scarf. Is the requirement for Hijaab fulfilled by covering her hair with such a scarf?\n\nA: Allah Ta'ala says, 'They (females) should not make apparent their adornment.' (Nur 30).\n\nThe word, 'adornment' refers to 'places of adornment, e.g. hair, ears, neck, etc.' (Ma'riful Qur'aan vol.6 pg.384; Darul Kutub). Allaamah ibn Katheer (RA) has expressly included 'Dhawaaib' (locks of hair) under the wordadornment. (Ibn Katheer vol.3 pg.294; Darul Ma'rif). In view of the above, it is imperative that the hair must not be seen at all. Wearing a thin scarf wherein the hair, being an area of adornment, is exposed is contrary to the above mentioned order of Allah Ta'ala.\n</"
