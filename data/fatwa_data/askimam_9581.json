  "question": "Praying 40 salah's in Madina has be 40 continous in 8 days starting from fajr only or can start from dhurur/asr",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have been to madina several times and I have offered my prayers in masjid e nabwi several times, the total of which could be more than 40. But that has not been continous in a row. My hajj is over. I want to take special leave of 8 days or so and offer 40 salahs in madina. Does that has to start only from fajr?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Hadith simply mentions 40 continuous Salaat. Thus, it will not be necessary for it to start from Fajr.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
