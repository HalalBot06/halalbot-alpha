  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have question regarding fasting. Due to health problem i did not fast for the past 3 years. so, what is the Kaafarah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nSince you did not fast due to health problems, there is no kaffārah.  Instead, it is necessary to make up the fasts when your health permits.  In case the health conditions are such that you do not expect to be able to make up the fasts in the future, you may pay fidyah of 1.6kg of wheat or its value to the poor for each missed fast.  However, if you regain health in the future, even if after paying the fidyah, it will be necessary to make up the fasts.\n\n \n\n(أحسن الفتاوى، كتاب الصوم: 4/430؛ سعيد)\n\n \n\n(فتاوى رحيمية، كتاب الصوم، فدية صوم وصلاة: 7/271-272؛ الإشاعت)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
