  "question": "1). How do u make the intention for missed witr salah or 2 sunnah of fajr if u then pray them after sun rise and before zawwal time? Do you say that they are qadha salahs?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n2). How do you make niyyah for salatul duha? Do you say time of prayer ishraq or something else? 3). Can you pull out grey hairs? 4). Is a woman?s back awrah infront of other women? 5). If you promise one muslim that you will give him something as a gift at a later date then another muslim asks you for it and they do more Ibaadah than the first person and are in more need, can you change your mind and give to the second person instead? What if they are both good muslims? Would you be untrustworthy and a bad muslim if you went back on your word to the first one? 6). Is it makruh to sleep after you have prayed asr salah? What if you are on your menses? 7). I have read it is makruh to sleep before Isha. Again does this apply to menstruating women? 8). I am confused about one issue. When a muslim says or does something which you think is not right from Islam, what should you do, correct him as islam is naseeha or make excuse for him and think well of him like some ahadith state like the one of making from 1 to 70 excuses for him? 9). J If a woman is on her menses during the time for tawaf al ifaadah/ziyaarah and cannot remain in ihram until she is clean again because she is from a different country and has to leave with her mahram and hajj group, can she tie some material around her private parts or just use sanitary towels and do this tawaf so that she can come out of ihram? JazakAllah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Yes, in your Niyyah, you should mention 3 Witr Qadhaa. There is no Qadhaa for the Sunnats of Fajr.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Salaat al-Dhuhaa is after Salaatul Ishraaq (which is about 10 or 15 minutes after sunrise). Salaat al-Dhuhaa will be after the sun has risen considerably. Its Niyyah should be the normal Niyyaah for any Nafl Salaat. (Tahtawi)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. It is undesirable to pull out grey hair.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. The Awrah of a woman in front of other woman is the same as the Awrah of a man (i.e. navel to knees) in front of other men and also including the stomach, chest and back. In front of Kaafir women, she should cover everything. (Hidaaya)%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Since you promised the first person something, you will have to fulfil it. It will not be permissible to go back on it. Instead, you should try and give both of them something.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. It is only Makrooh to sleep before Esha or after Asr Salaat if there is a fear of you missing it. However, since you are in menses you cannot read Esha and Asr Salaats, it will not be Makrooh. (Shaami)%0D%0A%0D%0A7. Refer 6 above.%0D%0A%0D%0A8. If you are sure the person is doing wrong and you fear for his Imaan, you should correct him. However, if you are not certain he is doing wrong, e.g. you see someone doing something which has two possibilities, good and bad, then in that case try and make good thoughts for him and give him the benefit of the doubt.%0D%0A%0D%0A9. She should make all attempts to delay going back until she becomes pure again. A woman in the state of Haydh may not enter any Musjid, let alone Musjidul-Haram. The Fuqahaa have mentioned that should a woman perform her Tawaaf-e-Ziyaarah in the state of Haydh, the Tawaaf is considered as valid, even though the woman is sinful in doing such a Tawaaf. In such a case, she has to have a Budnah (large animal, camel, etc.) slaughtered in the Haram as a compensation for this sinful act.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0Afor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
