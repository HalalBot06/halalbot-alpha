  "question": "Can dead Muslims hear us when we visit their graves?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe scholars have differences of opinion on whether the inmates of the grave\ncan hear the visitors or not. According to one Aayat of the noble Qur'aan,\nAllah Ta'ala says, 'Verily you cannot make the dead hear.'\n\nAfter the battle of Badr, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) addressed\nthe Kuffaar who were killed and thrown into the well. Upon enquiry,\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'They (the dead) hear very\nclearly.'\n\nIn view of the different quotations, many scholars have concluded that the\ndead hear if Allah wills.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
