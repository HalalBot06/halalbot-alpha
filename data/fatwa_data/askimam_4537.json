  "question": "Is it permissible for a pharmacist to supply emergency hormonal contraception. Also can animal studies (growing tumours and then testing drugs) for the purpose of cancer research be carried out.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe pharmacy companies and law suggests it should be supplied but does allow some room for individual ethics and beliefs. Ideally I would send them to another chemist or ask them to see the other available pharmacist but what if I am the only one available. I could then face legal implications if I was not to supply. I am considering going into research but this does involve testing the drugs or even growing tumours to see how they grow etc. Is such testing deemed necessary? And if not is permissible?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPlease explain what \"emergency hormonal contraception\" is.\n\nIt is permissible to test drugs on animals, and to grow tumours on them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
