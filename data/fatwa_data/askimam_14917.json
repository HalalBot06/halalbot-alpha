  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have one of my friend here working in Jeddah Saudi Arabia who just married last month. He is indian national from Mumbai and on work visa over here since 5 years.\n\nHe came to realize after his marriage that his mother don't like the bride at all and the bride alone will not be able to adjust in groom's parents house in his absence. His parents were not feeling weill with them after there Nikah to move freely and mingle with relatives and passes false arguments againts the bride's relatives. So when he left back for Jeddah, he shifted his wife to her parents till he settled visa for her over here.\n\nHis parents are not feeling good with this decision of him and saying that he has disobeyed them and taken decision against there will. They says that God will not give you parents again but wife you can get again by marrying any other girl again and wife is not much important than parents. They are very angry with him these days.\n\nHis marriage take place in Mumbai.\n\nIn the light of Shariat, is this decision of groom is OK? and whether his parents are right or wrong.\n\nDo he disobeyed his parents or no?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nYour friend has acted appropriately by sending his wife to her parentsâ€™ home. She does not have to live with he in-laws in the absence of her husband. The husband also cannot impose on his wife to live with his parents in his absence. If he does so, he will be infringing on her rights. It is not permissible to infringe on the rights of the wife to please ones parents. His action will not be regarded as disobedience to parents in Shariah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
