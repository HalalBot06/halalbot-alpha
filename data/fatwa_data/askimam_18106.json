  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1.is it allowed for women and men to watch news and documentries on TV. Will it be considered as \" zina of ears\"\n\n2.Is it allowed for women to listen Naat and bayanat of ulemas and naatkhawns like Junaod Jamshed etc.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n1.      The view of our Dārul Iftā concerning documentaries and news on television is that of impermissibility.\n\n \n\nTo watch television is Zina of the eyes. This occurs when images of men and women are displayed on television and are viewed by the opposite gender. If music is heard over the television, it would constitute sin of the ears and not Zina of the ears.   \n\n \n\n2. It is permissible for women to listen to bayānāt and nāts, as it increases their knowledge and enhances their love for Allāh Ta’āla and Rasulullāh (sallallāhu alayhi wa sallam). However, it is important that the contents of the bayānāt or nāts be proper and that women listen to them with the correct intention. If nāts or bayānāt are heard for purposes of entertainment in a manner that creates fitnah (evil) and arouses their feelings, then it will not be permissible.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
