  "answer": "QUESTION\n\na little while ago i watched a movie called the Woodsman. They were saying many bad works, and in the end during the credits i realized that the main actors name was Kevin Bacon. this made me wonder. can words be haram? and if so am i allowed to watch movies with Kevin Bacon?\n\nthis has been bothering me ever since, i feel like i have maybe made a mistake.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\n \n\nWe appreciate you writing to us. Worrying about ones evil deeds is a sign of faith. The first thing that we would like to bring your attention is the fact that movies in general contain many elements that are against the teachings of the pure Shariah, which seeks to create a pure and harmonious society and to eradicate evil in the society that leads humans to act like beasts. The following are some evils that movies promote indiscriminately that can be observed by any unbiased and honest person:\n\n \n\n-          Nudity\n\n-          Promiscuity\n\n-          Intermingling of the genders\n\n-          Profanity\n\n-          Offensive language\n\n-          Vulgarity\n\n-          Vanity\n\n-          Violence\n\n-          Crime\n\n-          Greed\n\n-          Corruption\n\n-          Dishonesty\n\n-          Atheism, secularism and non-spirituality\n\n-          Mockery of religion\n\n-          Disrespect of parents, teachers and elders\n\n-          Defiance of authority\n\n-          Following ones whims and desires indiscriminately\n\n \n\n… and the list goes on and on. What the name of the actor is is irrelevant—poison is poison no matter what name may be given to it. If reflected upon with an open mind, one will realise the satanic nature of movies and all the evil and corruption it has polluted humanity with.\n\n \n\nTV and movies are but tools, or rather, weapons of mass destruction, of Shaytaan with which he diverts the attention of man away from Allah in his attempt to wreak havoc upon mankind. Allah says in the Quran:\n\n \n\nاسْتَحْوَذَ عَلَيْهِمُ الشَّيْطَانُ فَأَنْسَاهُمْ ذِكْرَ اللَّهِ أُولَئِكَ حِزْبُ الشَّيْطَانِ أَلَا إِنَّ حِزْبَ الشَّيْطَانِ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ \n\n \n\nShaytan has gained mastery over them, and has made them forget the remembrance of Allah. They are Shaytan's party. Now, surely, it is Shaytan's party that are the losers (Quran 58:19)\n\n \n\n \n\nAllah also says:\n\n \n\nيَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آَمَنُوا لَا تُلْهِكُمْ أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَلَا أَوْلَادُكُمْ عَنْ ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَمَنْ يَفْعَلْ ذَلِكَ فَأُولَئِكَ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ \n\n \n\nO you who believe! Let not your wealth nor your children distract you from remembrance of Allah. Those who do so, they are the losers (Quran 63:9) \n\n \n\nEach moment spent in negligence will be a means of regret and remorse in the life hereafter. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alahi Wa Sallam) said in a hadith:\n\n \n\nليس يتحسر أهل الجنة إلا على ساعة مرت بهم لم يذكروا الله فيها ( رواه البيهقي في شعب الايمان رقم 541 ) \n\n \n\n‘Those who are admitted into Paradise will not regret over anything of this world, except the time spent without remembrance of Allah in their life.’ \n\n \n\nA person neither acquires any material benefit nor spiritual benefit through movies—i.e. they are a total waste of time, effort and money. Watching movies causes one to admire the way of life of the disbelievers. People who watch movies want to behave and act like the movie stars. Once someone asked Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alahi Wa Sallam) about the status of a person who admires a nation but has not joined them yet. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alahi Wa Sallam) replied, “A man will be (on the day of judgement) with the one he loves and admires.” (Bukhari)\n\n \n\nعن أبي موسى قال قيل للنبي صلى الله عليه وسلم الرجل يحب القوم ولما يلحق بهم قال المرء مع من أحب ( رواه البخاري ، رقم 5704 ) \n\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alahi Wa Sallam) also said: \n\n \n\nمن تشبه بقوم فهو منهم ( رواه الطبراني في الأوسط ، رقم 8562 ) \n\n \n\n‘Whoever resembles a nation, he is from them.’\n\n \n\nPeople, globally, are spending billions of dollars annually on entertainment and recreation; yet, depression amongst the masses has reached epidemic levels. The reason is that peace, tranquility, satisfaction and contentment are not to be found in movies and other forms of entertainment; instead, they are in leading a righteous and moral life based upon the Islamic principles and ethics. Allah states:\n\n \n\nمَنْ عَمِلَ صَالِحًا مِنْ ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنْثَى وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلَنُحْيِيَنَّهُ حَيَاةً طَيِّبَةً وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَجْرَهُمْ بِأَحْسَنِ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ \n\n \n\nWhoever works righteousness, man or woman, and has Faith, verily, to him will We give a life that is good and pure and We will bestow on such their reward according to the best of their actions (Quran 16:97)\n\n \n\nAlso, Allah says:\n\n \n\nأَلَا بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ\n\n \n\nLo! By Allah's remembrance are the hearts set at rest (Quran 13:28)\n\n \n\nIn short, TV and movies are destructive to ones Iman. The damage they have done to humanity is a living reminder of the heinous consequences. Therefore, a Muslim should stay far away from them. Instead, read the Quran, do zikr, read Islamic books, spend time with righteous people and offer your prayers regularly in the masjid. May Allah give us all the true understanding of deen and the ability to act upon it. Ameen.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\nMl.
