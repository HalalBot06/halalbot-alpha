  "answer": "QUESTION\n1.During 4 rakat farz prayer with jamat,In 4th rakath while sitting if one forget that it is 4th rakath instead think that its 2nd rakath and recite attahiyath till half (till asadonelaillaha) when imam says assalaamalikum warahamathullah what one should do if he has already prayed 4 rakaths.Shall he turn his face with imam and complete the namaz.Is this valid or shall he has to perform the prayer again as one has not recited attahiyath complete or can we do sajda sahu but while in jamath how we can do sajda sahu. 2.If one recited the full attahiyath in 2nd rakth instead of half while praying in jamat then what he should do at the end of prayer how can his prayer be valid\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. When the Imaam says Salaam in the fourth Rakaat, the Muqtadi (follower) should complete his Tashahhud if he did not do so before making Salaam. There is no Sajdah-e-Sahw on a follower if he made an error in Salaat behind the Imaam.\n\n2. It appears that your understanding of Attahiyyaat is that it is two portions, Attahiyyaat and Durood Ibraahim, and half of that is reciting only Attahiyyaat, The full is reciting Durood Ibraahim. If the follower recited Durood Ibraahim in the second Rakaat, there is no Sajdah-e-Sahw on him. The Salaat will be valid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
