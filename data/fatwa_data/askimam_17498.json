  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. Have you studied closely the criteria of Wifaqul Ulama london, and Rabetatul Ulama Batley.\n2. If so, do you agree with them.\n3. Decision to follow South Africa's ru'yat in the event of no sighting in UK, even with no imkaane ru'yat in UK according to astronomic calculation, seems not sound, though we follow global horizon in such an event. Thus we have celebrated last Ramadhan and Eidain well off the imakaane ru'yat. is this proper?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1.       I have studied the criteria of moon-sighting by Wifaqul Ulama and Rabetatul Ulama.\n\n2.       I agree with the criteria.\n\nIn principle, if the crescent has been sighted anywhere in the world and that is reliably communicated then that information is valid in Shariah. It follows, if the crescent was sighted in South Africa, it will be sufficient for the UK. Imkanee  Ru’yat by astronomical calculation is used merely as a guide and by no means is the Sharia criteria for sighting. Furthermore, on the basis of not following Ikhtilafe Matalih, there is no need for Imkanee Ru’yat only in UK.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa\n\nImportant Posts and Links\n\n \n\nShar'ii stance on Shares and Stocks|Have you prepared your WILL??|Moonsighting - Its that time to sight the moon"
