  "question": "I am having problems with my marriage & iman, please help & advise me.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI stop & start praying, my wife tells me to be good but I ignore her. My iman goes up & down. I argue with my wife over silly things. I have even shaved my beard off now. I want to sort myself out. Are there duas or anything I can do to rectify my & remove the evil within?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMay Allah Ta'ala grant you and your wife love, compassion and happiness.%0D%0A%0D%0AHappiness between the spouses will be inculcated if they do not go by the%0D%0Astrict rule, 'My rights'. Rather, happiness is inculcated through Ihsaan and%0D%0AKhidmat. If every person goes out of his%2Fher way to fulfil the rights of the%0D%0Aother, instead of demanding his%2Fher own rights, that will enhance love and%0D%0Aunderstanding.%0D%0A%0D%0AEasy step to reform: Immediately repent. If time permits, take a Ghusl%0D%0A(bath). Dawn one's best clothes, apply Itr then perform two Rakaats Salaat%0D%0Aal-Tawbah. Turn to Allah, cry, repent over your sins. Make a firm intention%0D%0Athat from now on, I will start keeping a beard, never will I shave it off.%0D%0ATurn a new leaf, ask of Allah Ta'ala's assistance. Allah willing, you will%0D%0Achange.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe easiest way to gain the required courage to abstain from sins, to%0D%0Apractice good deeds and to develop strong Imaan is to befriend the friends%0D%0Aof Allah and stay in their company.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
