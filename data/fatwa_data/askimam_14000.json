  "question": "I will pay the bill with my money for $100.00 and collect my fee for writing the check, mailing out the payment and be responsible if my check is not cleared by the bank.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI had recently asked a question regarding a business that I would like to start. I will be doing bill payment for people. I know that this business is allowed. However, one thing that is different is that the customer will not have the money to pay his bill.\n\nfor example. phone bill is $100.00\n\nI will pay the bill with my money for $100.00 and collect my fee for writing the check, mailing out the payment and be responsible if my check is not cleared by the bank.\n\nThey will pay me my $100.00 after 30 days\n\nCan I collect a fee for doing this. I will have employees, rent, office cost and bank cost. Please respond ASAP I will be starting the business really soon. I know that I can't charge a fee for giving them the $100 that will be interest.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYou are aware that you cannot give an amount equivalent to the bill and charge a fee specifically for that as that will be interest and prohibited.\n\nYou may, however, offer a service to pay the bills of people and charge a fee for that service. The fee must be a standard one and not in relation to the bill. For example, if a bill is $100, you may do all the necessary arrangements of writing the cheque, going to the bank, etc. and charge $10 for that. The same would be for a $1000 bill. The service fee should not be on the percentage of the amount due as that will not reflect as an amount paid for a service.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
