  "question": "According to the Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah, a person remains a Muslim in spite of his sins",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nUntil when does a person remain a Muslim? I mean; obviously if we start committing sin continuously we will be bad muslim. Is it possible for a person to commit such a sin (or too many sins) such that he/she is no longer a muslim?\n\nAnd what might those sins be? Could you please refer from the Quran.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAccording to the Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah, a person remains a Muslim in spite of his sins. Committing any amount of sins does not render a person out of the fold of Islam. However, there are three things that render a person out of Islam.\n\nIstihzaa- that is making a mockery of Deen.\nIslihlaal- That is to regard something halal which is clearly haram in Shariah for example Interest.\nIstikhfaaf- that is to treat the laws of Shariah lightly and with total disregard.\n\nAll these three can be encapsulated in one word- Respect for Deen.\n\nIf a person has respect for Deen, he will not make a mockery of any aspect of deen, he will regard haram as haram and he will not show complete and total disregard for Deen.\n\nSuch a person will acknowledge his weakness in practicing Deen and will not justify his wrong doings.\n\nSuch a person gets the tawfiq and ability to make tawba.\n\nAccording to Shariah, any violation of Shariah is a sin. That includes violation of an injunction of the Quran, Hadith and rulings of Fuqaha.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
