  "answer": "QUESTION\nAccording to them even job of peon and guard is haram. Please clarify or correct me with reasons.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer below our standard reply to similar queries.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nThere are two aspects to working in a bank: a) Source and amount of income,\nb) Assisting in sin.\n\nIf the major source of income in a bank is Haraam, then it is not\npermissible to work there. If that is not the case, the income earned will\nbe permissible. As regards assisting in sin, there has to be some limitation\nas every action leadingto a sin is directly or indirectly related to it. In\nprinciple, if one is not directly involved in an interest bearing\ntransaction, it is permissible. That is, for example, working in the IT\ndepartment of the bank. However, ideally a person should seek an alternative\nsource of income."
