  "question": "I really couldnt understand how the salary is halal (ok) for working in IT department of bank",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWorking in bank in IT departement.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are a number of scenarios, as far as working in a bank is concerned.\nIs the bank owned by Muslims or not?\n\nIf it is owned by Muslims, then it will not be permissible to work at the\nbank if the majority of the income is Haraam.\n\nIf it is a non-Muslim owned bank, then one will consider the type of service\nbeing rendered to the bank. If the function of the employee does not involve\ninterest or any other prohibited act, then such employment will be\npermissible. If the nature of his work involved him being a party to any\nHaraam, then such an employment will not be permissible.\n\nNow, the person in the IT department will have to determine whether or not\nhe is directly involved with or promotes any Haraam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
