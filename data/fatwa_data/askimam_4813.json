  "question": "Question on the arrival on Isa (a) and on a book",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nas-sallam wa alakum wa ramatullah he wa barakatuhu. (1) I have a question on the re-appperence on isa(a). since there will be no prophet after muhammad (S), does that mean isa (a) will recive wahi? because he will no be born but desend from the heavens. so he was already born before prophet muhammad (s), so can he still introduce new rules into islam and even new quranic ayats? (2) what are you views on the book \"Remedies of the holy quran\". it contains many remedies, but some people told me many of them do not work.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Isa (Alayhis salaam) will appear as an Ummati (follower) of Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Hence, there is no question of him\nintroducing new rules, etc. into Islam. He will also adhere to the Shari'ah\nof Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\n\n2. The Qur'aan is a cure for mankind. On grounds of experience, Ulama have\nrecommended certain verses of the Qur'aan for certain ailments. Many of\nthese remedies have been tried and tested successfully over the years. If\nany of these Qur'aanic remedies fail to work, it does not mean that the\nremedy is deficient. The degree of sincerity and confidence of the person\nemploying the remedy plays a major role in the success of the remedy.\nSometimes, it wouldn't work because Allah Ta'ala has decreed otherwise.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
