  "answer": "QUESTION\nHello brothers. I am having trouble I keep getting bad thoughts about Allah in my mind I try to stop them then they come back. I sometimes cry when I repent about this. Is there any dua that will help me with these thoughts ? 2)I see things in my dreams that happen the day next. Thats weird, what is this about ??\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There are two types of thoughts; voluntary and involuntary. Voluntary bad thoughts are prohibited as that is in one?s control. We are responsible and accountable for our own actions and deeds. Voluntary thoughts are our own actions and deeds. We have no control over involuntary bad thoughts. Those are the whispers of the Shaytaan and we are not accountable for that. When one has such evil thoughts, recite ?Laa hawla walaa quwwata illaa billaah? and ignore such thoughts. Do not pay attention to such thoughts and do not bother. Such evil thoughts being the whispers of Shaytaan should be treated with contempt and ignored. If one gives a little attention to such thoughts, the Shaytaan feels honoured. It has achieved its purpose of diverting and consuming one?s mind in evil and wrong. One should never give into that. Simply treat such thoughts with contempt and ignore them.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. To see dreams about the future is not weird. It is simply a true dream. At times, Allah inspires people about the future through true dreams.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
