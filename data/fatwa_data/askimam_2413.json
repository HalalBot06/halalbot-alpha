  "question": "Mother wants to send daughter to University but daughter does not want to go",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf someone's mother tell her daughter to go to haram place that is University where ther are mixings should the daughter still go and study hard to join there. The mother is telling her to go for helping the other muslim women so she wants the daughter to become a doctor for all women in the world. But is it not haram to do such thing even though the reason might be good. Even though the daughter does not want to go should she still try her best in all her lower grades just to please her mother for the sake of Allah(SWT) Or since that it is haram she should rather wait and make Dua to see the change on her mother's opinion which will be given by Allah(SWT) soon? Insha Allah!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is necessary for one to obey one's parents as long as they do not command\none to do something which is Haraam. No creation may be obeyed when obeying\nthem will result in one disobeying Allah Ta'ala.\n\nIn the enquired case, the daughter should try to explain the Shari'ah view\nregarding intermingling of sexes, etc. to her mother, make Du'aa for her\nguidance and if she thinks that her mother will forcefully enrol her in\nuniversity, if she makes the grade then she should pretend to be studying\nhard and trying to make the grade, but not do so, so that her mother will\nnot be able to enrol her even if she still wishes to.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
