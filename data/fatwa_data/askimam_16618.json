  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. Would you mention the many forms in which the guidance for istikarah appear to one(like dreaming etc..)?\n\n2. The husband's duty with regard to his wife's hijab: If the wife is modern and finds it hard to wear the hijab is the husband's duty done if he tells her he wants her to have an open and willing mind to wear it,tells her of the benefits of full hijab and makes dua that she wears it,instead of enforcing it on her?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1.      if one observes Istikhara correctly, then Allah will guide the individual to the right path and grant him contentment and satisfaction at heart in that decision. Dreams indicate toward the Divine guidance carried out to realize the proper guidance of the Istikhara.\n\n2.      The husband is responsible to ensure that his wide adheres to the laws of hijab. If she violates the laws of hijab, he will be sinful.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
