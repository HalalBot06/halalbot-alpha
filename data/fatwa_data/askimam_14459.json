  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nwho is Allah talking about in 3:90?\n\n003.090 YUSUFALI: But those who reject Faith after they accepted it, and then go on adding to their defiance of Faith,- never will their repentance be accepted; for they are those who have (of set purpose) gone astray. Who is Allah talking about in this verse? Does this mean that if before you became non-Muslim, then was really against islam, but then repented and want to be good, your repentece will not be accepted?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nBefore examining verse 90, one needs to exermine verse89 to gain a correct perspective regarding Murtad (appostate). Basically, there are three types of apostates:\n\n1. One who leaves his religion and does not have any intention of returning to his religion.\n\n2. A person who leaves his religion and then repents.\n\n3. A person who chooses the wrong path and thinks he is on the right path.\n\nVerse90 refers to an appostate belonging to the third category. He has chosen a path of disbelieve thinking it to be a path of guidance. If such a person makes tawbah whilst still on disbelieve, his repentance will be to no avail.\n\nVerse89 indicates toward an apostate of the second category, ‘except for those who repent (even) after that apostacy and make amends, for verily, Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.’ (3:90)\n\nHere, an apostate is referred to one who leaves his religion after realising the folly and makes every effort to make amends for leaving the religion. Allah himself mentions that He is oft-forgiving, most merciful.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
