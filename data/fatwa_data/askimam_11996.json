  "question": "If a Muslim does,t say his prayers then does he/she gets the status of Kafir?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Sahib, If a Muslim man or woman does not say his/her Fard prayers then does he/she gets the status of Kafir. With reference to the Hadith which states approximately that Salah is the difference between a Muslim and Kafir. What is the status of a Muslim who intentionally does not follow Fard or follows Haram. How should others react to such Brothers.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person does not deny the 5 salaah being Fard, but does not perform them, then he would be classified a major sinner, but would not leave the fold of Islam.\n\nThe hadith means that the difference between a true and perfect Muslim and a kaafir is salah, thus one who doesn't perform his salah is not a perfect believer. Anyone who commits major sins or leaves out Fard actions, without denying them being fard, would still be a muslim, however he should be advised and counselled to leave his bad ways. Close contacts should not be kept with such a person as his bad habits could rub of onto you.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Husain Kadodia\nSTUDENT: Darul Ifta\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
