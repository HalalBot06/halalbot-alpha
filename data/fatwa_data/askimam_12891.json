  "question": "In Islam is it OK to sell a Mosque?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe are in process of getting a bigger Masque for our community in Woodland California USA. In Islam is it OK to sell a Masque? The Masque we have now is not a traditional Masque, it has no towers and no tomb, it is a big room. We are selling because we can put the money toward a new Masque.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA Mosque (Masjid) is generally Waqf for Allah Ta?ala. The principle, in Waqf that Allah becomes the sole owner of the property.\n\nIt is permissible to take benefit from such a Waqf that is performing Salaat, etc. However, it is not permissible to sell it. One has no right over this property. Even though the proceeds is used to finance a new Musjid. (Hidaaya vol.2 pg.690; Ilmiyah)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
