  "answer": "QUESTION\nI?m quiet confused here because I paid Zakat just once in my life and it was last year, it was not because I was lazy but because I have never reached the Nissab before ? anyway to explain well my confusion I need to give you an example and you could answer me appropriately and quickly because I need to pay my Zakat now Let?s say the Nissab of the Zakat is $50 ?. And say also I usually pay my Zakat on Month12 (it?s not really December but it?s just an example). I got $50 in Month12 / 2001 In Month12 / 2002 (it?s one year now that I possess $50) I paid 2.5% of it ?

You also have $50 of the previous year excluding $1.25\n\nThe total Zakaatabl;e amount is 2.5% on $120 (this year) + $48.75 (last year)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
