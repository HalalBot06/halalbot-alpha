  "question": "Should we follow the Imams in Makkah as they pray different from us because they follow a different Imam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI went to Makkah last Ramadhan. On the day when the Imam Sudais finished the Qu'raan in Taraweeh,straight after the last surah (kul a'oodhu birab binnaas), people raised their hands for a long du'aa. I was not sure whether I should do the same because I follow the Imam Abu Hanifa and Sudais follows a different one. Similarly, also for the witr wajib in Isha salaat the Imam prays it differently to what we do. Do we follow the Imam which is leading the prayer as well?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOne should follow the Imaams of Haramayn Sharifayn in all the Salaats.\nHowever, in Witr Salaat, one may join them with the intention of performing\nNafl Salaat and thereafter perform Witr Salaat individually.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
