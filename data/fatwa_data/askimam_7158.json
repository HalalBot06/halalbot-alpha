  "question": "1:Duaa coming up from RUKU before going into soedjood. Can we make our own prayer after saying \"RAB-BA-NAA WA-LA-KAL HAMD\", not neccessarily qunoot ?2:Fancy musallahs distracting",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n(1) : From hadeeth, I read that the Nabee(SAWS), sometimes made duaa asking for ALLAH hu ta-alla, to forgive people he mentioned by name. Can we do the same, when we feel the need for it ? (2) : should we buy the musallahs that have nice and fancy artwork of the kaba, and holy mosques, on it. It is said that it is prefered to salaah open eyes, and that ones eyes be set on where one's head is going to be placed. These fancy musallahs is very distracting.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. One should firstly recite the Qunoot. Thereafter, if one wishes to make further Du?aa, one may do so. The Du?aa has to be in Arabic.\n\n2. We agree with you. It is best to have plain and simple Musallahs that do not distract a person.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
