  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf someone passes wind alot during salat, what can he do? or how many time can he perform ablution to get the whole reward for the congregational prayer?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\n \n\nIf a person passes wind so often that he is unable to perform two rakats Salah for an entire Salah time, ten he is a ma‛dhoor (an excused person). Shariah has granted exemption to such a person. When he performs wudhu, he should perform Salah with that wudhu even though he has passed wind. The passing of wind or any other excuse, for example bleeding gums etc will not invalidate the wudhu for the entire salah time. The person will get the full reward of performing salah in congregation. Once the Salah time expires, the wudhu will be invalidated and the excused person will have to perform a new wudhu to perform another  Fardh Salah.\n\nFor more details on the laws of ma‛dhoor person refer to this link: http://www.askimam.org/fatwa/fatwa.php?askid=4667b2790c46f2629cb1e14b1ca7ec1b\n\nحاشية الطحطاوي على مراقي الفلاح شرح نور الإيضاح (1 / 148(:\n\n\"ودم الاستحاضة\" ...\"كرعاف دائم لا يمنع صلاة\" ...ولا..صوما...\"وتتوضأ المستحاضة\" ...\"ومن به عذر كسلس بول أو استطلاق بطن\" وانفلات ريح ...\"لوقت كل فرض\"\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\n \n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
