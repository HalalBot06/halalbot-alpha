I fear his punishment. thank you very much. salam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour intention to live a Shar'ee compliant life is indeed very noble. You%0D%0Aenquired about moving to a Muslim country to achieve that. It is unfortunate%0D%0Ato state that at present there is no Muslim country in the world that has an%0D%0Aenvironment of strictly adhering to the Shari'ah.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe so-called Muslim countries are under western influence and there is very%0D%0Alittle of Islam there. The leaders of the Muslim countries are concerned%0D%0Aabout their power and luxuries than practicing and implementing Islam.%0D%0ATherefore, moving to any Muslim country to grow up in an Islamic environment%0D%0Amay not serve your purpose. We advise you associate with the Ulama and pious%0D%0Apeople of your locality and work towards establishing an Islamic%0D%0Aenvironment. By associating with pious people and more so in the effort of%0D%0Aestablishing a Deeni environment, it is more likely you will achieve your%0D%0Apurpose of maintaining your faith and being Shari'ah compliant.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
