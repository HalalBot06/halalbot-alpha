Allamah Suyuti: Abdur Rahmaan ibn Abu Bakr al-Suyootiy al-Shaafi’ee [ra] was born and bred in Egypt. He memorised the Qur’aan at the age of 8. He studied under approximately 51 teachers. At the age of 40, he adopted solitude on the banks of river Nile and it was here that he authored most of his books. He authored approximately 600 books in his lifetime. His famous compilations are Tadreeb al-Raawi in principles of Hadith, first half of Tafseer Jalalayn in exegesis and al-Durr al-Manthoor in exegisis with a traditionistic approach. He passed away in Egypt and is buried in Cairo.\n\n2. There are quite a few Allaamah Sha’raanis. Which one are you referring to?\n\n3. It is very dangerous to become a self taught scholar. The knowledge of Deen is not passed on by books, but it is passed from heart to heart. The books that we read should also be under the guidance of the Ulama-e-Haqq.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
