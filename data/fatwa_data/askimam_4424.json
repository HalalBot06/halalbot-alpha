  "question": "Is Dog Saliva Najis for Maalikis?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamualaikum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu. I am a convert to Islam who follows the Hanafi school of thought. My friend is also a convert, but he follows the Maaliki school of thought. We have a difference of opinion that I hope you can resolve. I maintain that the saliva of dogs is considered to be najis by all Muslims, regardless of which madhab they follow. He, on the other hand, insists that the issue is merely one of jurisprudence, and that, while the Hanafi scholars view dog saliva to be najis, Malaki scholars do not. He believes that his salaat will be valid if he makes it after being licked by a dog. Could you please explain who is right? Also, can you please explain the steps required for Tahaarah after being licked by a dog? Wassalaam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the majority schools of thought, the saliva of a dog is impure.\n\nThere are different opinions from the Maliki school of thought. According to\none opinion, it is not impure. I am not sure which opinion is preferred. You\nmay contact me after Ramadaan for that as I am presently abroad and do not\nhave research resources available.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
