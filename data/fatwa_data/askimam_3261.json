  "question": "About the Day of Qiyamah. On the Day of Judgement, will I be able to see what happened to Shia and non-Muslim people I know.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI mean, will i be able to see what happens to them? Also, if Insha Allah i enter Jannah, will i be able to see what happened to the non Muslims who used to argue with me that Islam and Ahlus Sunnah are liars (Nauthobillah !)? Will i be able to tell them that \"On Earth i told you to follow the truth, but today Allah has given you the ajar of your deeds.\"?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala states, 'On the day of Qiyaamat, you will see those who spoke%0D%0Alies against Allah Ta'ala. Their faces will be turned black. Is Hell-fire%0D%0Anot an abode for those who were haughty?'%0D%0A%0D%0AAs for seeing and conversing with them after having entered Jannah, Allah Ta%0D%0A'ala depicts a typical conversation between the inmates of Jannat and the%0D%0Adwellers of hell in Surah 7 Verse 44-50%0D%0A%0D%0AVerse 44: 'The inmates of the garden (paradise) will call out to the%0D%0Adwellers of hell, 'We have indeed found the promises of our Lord true. Have%0D%0Ayou also found your Lord's promise true?' They will proclaim, 'Yes'. But a%0D%0Acrier shall call out between them, 'The curse of Allah is upon the%0D%0Awrong-doers.'%0D%0A%0D%0AVerse 50: 'The companions of the fire will call out to the dwellers of%0D%0Aparadise, 'Pour down to us water or anything that Allah Ta'ala has provided%0D%0Ayou with.' They will reply, 'Verily Allah has forbidden both these things%0D%0Afor those who rejected Him.'%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
