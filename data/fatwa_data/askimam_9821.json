  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu, (1) The answers you provided to questions 5142 and 5673 are confusing me. My problem is that after I make wudhu, my body decides to release wind from my hind private part. I try to suppress it so that I can read salaah but when I go into sajdah, I feel as if it came out. I don't hear or smell anything, it just feels like it came out. I've made it a habit to pass stool at least once a day and to release any wind before I make wudhu. This doesn't help. I noticed that when I'm not in a state of wudhu, the urge to release wind isn't there any more. Does my wudhu break or not? (2) I'm a male. After making istinja after urinating, I wrap some tissue around my front private part and leave it there for a while. This is to prevent any drips from soiling my underwear. Sometimes I forget to remove it and make wudhu and salaah. Is my wudhu and salaah nullified? Jazaakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. You state that you feel you pass wind when you in Wudhu or Salaat. You do not feel that way when you are not in Wudhu or in Salaat. That is a clear indication of the passing of wind being a mere thought. Be rest assured that your Wudhu is intact and your Salaat is valid.\n\n2. If you forget to remove the soiled tissue and performed Salaat with it, your Salaat will be valid but Makrooh (disliked). The Karaahat (dislike) will be removed due to forgetting to remove the tissue.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
