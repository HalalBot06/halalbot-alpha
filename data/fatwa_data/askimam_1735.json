  "question": "I have arthritis in my left ankle and cannot bend it to sit on my legs between sajdah, can I kneel on the floor and do sajdah on a chair.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan a womans feet be uncovered for prayer in home, Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSince you experience difficulty making sajda, you can sit on the chair and\nperform your salaah. You do not have to kneel on the floor. For ruku you\nshould lower your head and for sajda, you should lower it more.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
