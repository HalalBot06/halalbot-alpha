  "question": "Is there any hadith or the practice of Sahaba in which the bride had shared the expenses of walima with bridegroom.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIn your Fatwa # 14267 you have given a verdict as\n\n\"The bride’s party should not be burdened with the expenses or part of the expenses for the Walimah.\"\n\nWhere as for Fatwa # 14307 you have given a verdict as\n\n\"Walima is generally offered from the groom’s side. However, there is no harm if the bride shares in the expenses. \"\n\nFomer you have told that bride should not be burdened but later you are telling there is no harm if it is shared. Kindly can you please explain why there is a difference of your opinion in both the verdicts.\n\nIs there any hadith or the practice of Sahaba in which the bride had shared the expenses of  walima with bridegroom.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn Fatwa 14307, we have stated:\n\n1. It is the bridegroom’s responsibility to arrange the Walimah.\n\n2. In the Walima of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], the Sahaaba also presented whatever they had.\n\nIt is clear from this that there is no harm in sharing in fulfilling the Sunnah Walimah.\n\nIn Fatwa 14267, our emphasis was on imposing the sharing of expenses on the bride’s family. The bridegroom should bear the responsibility himself. He should not impose on the groom’s family to share the expenses. However, if the groom’s family volunteer to do so, then there is no harm.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
