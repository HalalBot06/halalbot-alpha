  "question": "I have three questions. Please advace!!!!!!",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) How can my girlfriend and I get married as we fear future fornication? Our parents both accepted our choice, but her family won't allow to get married at any circumstance without finishing college and getting job first. Is there anyway we could get married without her parents presents in the nikha? Please advice me according to shari'a what kind of people/relative should be witnessed. We are both Allah fearing. 2) You informed in Q #4636 That keeping beared is wajib and cutting is haram? Doesn't it make having beared a fard? At any case, how so? Last time I checked with imam, it was a Sunnah. I even heard from a scholar lecturing that inforcing a sunnah as ruling is not lawful. For instance, Taliban's ruling of have beared as a must, was a mistake in islamic-law... according to the scholar. You can do such a thing with only fard like Hijab for women, for example. I have seen lots of scholars and imam with little or no beard at all!! Are they not entering heaven for this? 3) I have problem with thinking that I am not purified after urinate even though I take time to clean and sit and move for five minutes. I always feel that urine may have dropped again. Therefore I sprinkle water in my underpants (I heard that some sahaba used to do that) Is it okay and validates the purity? (sometimes when I go check in the rest room I see no drops and sometimes I see a drop) Please advice.... Zazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If you and your future wife strongly fear committing adultery, that%0D%0Ashould be expressed to both parents in an endeavour to expediate the%0D%0Amarriage. If they do not co-operate and there is no alternative, then you%0D%0Amay marry her in the presence of two male witnesses or one Muslim male and%0D%0Atwo Muslim females.%0D%0A2. The terms Fardh, Waajib, etc, are terminologies with a specific academic%0D%0Adefinitions, both simply imply being compulsory, Fardh being of a greater%0D%0Adegree than Waajib. The Fuqahaa (jurists) have unanimously ruled that%0D%0Akeeping a beard is Waajib. The Taliban comprised of great Ulama and their%0D%0Asystem was based on Shura (consultation). They are Allah-fearing people and%0D%0Asensitive to implementing the true brand of Islam. It is improper for any%0D%0Aperson to make any comment against the Taliban without appropriate knowledge%0D%0Aand information about them.%0D%0A3. Your practice of sprinkling water on your underpants to avoid suspicion%0D%0Aand doubt is correct. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was advised%0D%0Aby Jibraaeel (Alayhis salaam) to advise the Ummah on the practice.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
