  "question": "Is there anything in the Quran which says people of the book are not allowed to enter Jannah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am aware that ultimately it is Allah's decision, but I was wondering if the Quraan provided a straightforward answer to this issue. Reading the Quran, I have only found evidence that Christians and Jews of today would also be allowed to enter heaven, not only those before the advent of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). For example in 2:62 and 3:110-115. However in all the commentaries I've read, and all the Imaams I've heard, have pointed toward them not being able to enter Jannah. \"They will only recieve their reward on earth.\" One source of mine, referred me to Surah 98 for the answer.After reading it, I still found zero evidence to make me believe that Jews and Christians of today are barred from heaven, as I believe that \"the truth\" and \"clear signs\" have not come to many of them. They believe what their circumstances (upbringing, friends, media, etc.) would have them believe, as many of our muslim brothers and sisters do as well. So, what makes the Muslim more able to enter heaven than a non-muslim? Did Allah favour the one above the other?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAfter having read the Aayat mentioned to substantiate your claim, we find%0D%0A'zero' evidence to make the statement, 'Jews of today will also enter%0D%0AJannah.' Hence, it will be interesting to know the basis and authenticity of%0D%0Ayour view.%0D%0A%0D%0AActually, everything needs to be understood in its proper perspective and%0D%0Acontext to gain the correct picture. Otherwise, the incorrect picture will%0D%0Abe perceived by people misunderstanding Imaan to be only monotheism. This%0D%0AAayat and the likes thereof need to be understood in conjunction with those%0D%0AAayaats that deal with the acceptance of prophethood also as a fundamental%0D%0Arequisite for correct Imaan which is desired by Allah and which will%0D%0Avalidate the passport to eternal bliss. Allah Ta'ala says in the noble Qur'%0D%0Aaan, 'Those who make Kufr with Allah and His messengers seek to%0D%0Adifferentiate between Allah and His messengers and say, 'We believe in a few%0D%0Aand reject a few'. They are the real disbelievers and we have prepared for%0D%0Athe disbelievers a torment and punishment.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIn other words, correct Imaan in the terminology of the Qur'aan is made of%0D%0Atwo aspects, monotheism and prophethood. Neglecting either one is Kufr.%0D%0ADisbelieving in any messenger is Kufr.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe same will apply to those Jews and Christians who do not fulfil this%0D%0Aportion of their faith as desired by Allah Ta'ala, negating the prophethood%0D%0Aof the final messenger of Allah, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
