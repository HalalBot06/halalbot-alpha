  "question": "Can interest earned on the bank account be used to offset bank charges (mainly govt taxes) for that same account or other accounts.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nNote that all accounts are held with the same bank, eg. Personal Account, Company Account, Superannuation Account etc.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nInterest monies must be given to the poor and needy who are eligible to\naccept Zakaat without the intention of reward. However, interest received\nfrom government institutes, eg. post office could be used to offset\ngovernment taxes. Interest received from private banks cannot be used to\noffset taxes. It may be used to offset interest charged from the same bank.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
