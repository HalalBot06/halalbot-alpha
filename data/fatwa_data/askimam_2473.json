  "question": "I have never had any contact with men (as I do purdah) and I dont think I could be a good wife and cope with intimacy. What can I do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy parents are religious and I cant speak to them about such matters and I feel ashamed to do so. Most of my life I have never had any contact with men, when I walk down the street I gaze on the floor.I dont want to get married, but what can I do? I feel afraid of getting married?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is only natural that a human being is afraid to deal with the unknown and\nunfamiliar. This fear will, Insha Allah, dissolve once you are actually\nmarried.\n\nTo prepare yourself, you should not feel ashamed to discuss your fear with\nyour parents, especially your mother who must have shared some of what you\nare presently experiencing in her youth. There is no shame in discussing a\nfact of life. Allah Ta'ala says, 'Verily Allah is not ashamed to discuss the\ntruth.' May Allah Ta'ala remove your fear and strengthen your heart.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
