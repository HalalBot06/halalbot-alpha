  "question": "What happens when a person dies and is layed to rest in the grave...I have heard that Allah punishes the sinful in the grave and opens 77 windows to Heaven for the good people.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have heard that Allah punishes the sinful in the grave and opens 77 windows to Heaven for the good people. Is this true. 2.I think that a person shall be awarded jannah or hell on the groung of his total deeds(i mean if a person has 51 good deeds and 49 bad acts to his credit then he shall be awarded jannah). Is this correct? If yes, then will he be not punished in the grave for his 49 bad acts.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The sinful are punished in the grave while the pious are rewarded. While there are certain weak narrations that mention 77 doors to Jahannum (hell) being opened in the grave for the sinful and 77 doors to Jannah (paradise) for the pious. Authentic narrations only make mention of one door, to Jahannum for the sinners and one to Jannah for the pious. (Tafseer ibn Katheer vol.2 pg.539)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The main punishment will take place in Jahannum for those sins which the person has not been forgiven for. Allah according to His will, punishes people for certain deeds in the grave. This punishment is sometimes to cleanse the person, so that he will not need to be cleansed in Jahannum, while in other cases it is to give the sinner a taste of the severe punishment awaiting him in Jahannum. Allah punishes whom he wishes, how He wishes and forgives in the same manner. We have no right to question the sublime and total authority of Allah and should strive our utmost to please him.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
