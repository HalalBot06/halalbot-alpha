  "answer": "QUESTION\nI want to ask that (1) Can we save Islamic Picture (eg. pic of Khana-e-Kaba, Madina Munawra etc) in mobile phone, keeping in mind that we some type put it in our pant pocket and some time it fall on ground. (2) If some major or minor sin has accured in Madina Munawra what will be the \"Kafara\" for this, as a person is too much guilty on his act of sin and want forgivness from Allah & Rasool Allah (Salal la ho alaihe wasalam), plz reply.  jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. If you have a feeling of disrespect by keeping the mobile phones with the pictures of the Ka’abah and Madinah Munawwarah in your pants or fear it falling down, then you should not save such pictures on your phone.\n\n2. When one is in the sacred lands of Makkah Mukarramah and Madina Munawwarah, he should guard himself from committing any sin. He should do everything possible to abstain from sin. The seriousness of committing sins in the Harams of Makkah Mukarramah and Madina Munawwarah is more severe. Nevertheless, if by human nature one did commit a sin in these sacred places, he should sincerely regret that and make Tawbah and Istighfaar. Make an intention that if Allah gives another opportunity to visit Makkah Mukarramah and Madina Munawwarah, he will exercise restrain and never commit sins again.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
