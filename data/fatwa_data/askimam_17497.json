  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nInshallah I will be going for umra in two months time. Can you please advise me on what ibadat i should try and engage in while in madina and makka. Also can you refer me to some books that will be of use. Jazakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIn Madina Munawwara, you should visit the Rowdha Mubarah as much as possible to convey Salam to Rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wasallam), Hadrath Abu Bakr Siddique (radiAllahu Anhu), and Umar Farooq (radiAllahu Anhu). Thereafter the greatest act is to recite abundant salat and salam (Durood) upon Rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wasallam). Try to make at least one khatam of the Quran in Madina Munawwara. Make a firm intention to follow the Sunnah of Rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wasallam) for the rest of your life.\n\nIn Makka Mukarramah, make as many tawafs as possible and also make one khatam of the Quran there. While going around the Ka’aba Sharif, make a firm intention to surrender your life in the obedience of Allah Taala.\n\nWe advise you read the book Fazail-e-Haj by Hazrath Sheikh Zakariyya (rehmatullah Alayh), the chapter on the virtues of Makka Mukarramah and Madina Munawwara.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa\n\nImportant Posts and Links\n\n \n\nShar'ii stance on Shares and Stocks|Have you prepared your WILL??|Moonsighting - Its that time to sight the moon"
