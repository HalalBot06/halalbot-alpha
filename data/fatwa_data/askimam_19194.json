  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe are in Business of Manufacturing of Brass Artwares & Aluminium Artwares. Now a day the market trends of over seas is Animal's Figures in Home Decoration. Please inform, Will in be Jayaz, if we can manufacture the Animal Figures of Metal.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nConsider the following hadīth.\n\nSa῾īd ibn Abil Hasan rehmatullah ῾alayh says, “I was by Ibn ῾Abbās radiallahu ῾anhu when a person came and said. “Oh Ibn ῾Abbās, my source of income is through the labour of my hands and I manufacture these pictures.” Ibn ῾Abbās radiallahu ῾anhu said. “I will not narrate to you except what I heard from Rasulullah salallahu ῾alayhi wasallam.\n\nI heard Rasulullah salallahu ῾alayhi wasallam saying, “Whosoever draws a picture, verily Allah will punish him until he can blow life into the picture and most definitely he will not be able to blow life into it. (so the punishment will be permanent).””\n\nThe person got very worried and the colour of his face changed. Ibn ῾Abbās radiallahu ῾anhu then said to him, “If you insist on manufacturing pictures then manufacture/draw pictures of this tree and all those things that do not have life (inanimate objects)”. (Bukhāri)\n\nTo draw pictures or manufacture forms of animate objects is prohibited. It is not permissible for a muslim to manufacture forms of animal figures and trade in them. The proceeds from such sales will not be halāl.\n\nWe make du῾ā’ Allah Ta’āla grant you barakah in your business, Ameen\n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n \nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
