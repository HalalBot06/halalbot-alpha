  "question": "Dream about marriage",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaam Alaikum Mufti sahab. I had a dream in which I saw the person I intend to marry in the future insha'Allah, getting married off to someone. And I find myself quite hurt in the dream. What is the significance of this dream? Also I had made istikhara about her a couple of times, but got no clear indication. What could this mean? Jazakallah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream has no significance. If you have any reservations about marrying\nthe person, you should not hasten. Hold on until you are satisfied with your\ndecision.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
