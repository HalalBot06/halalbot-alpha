  "question": "Why do some people go to Dargah's and some dont? what kind of belief lies in going at Dargah's",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nGenerally, there is a shortfall on Tarbiyya (teaching good manners) in%0D%0Asecular schols. How many a times we have heard of Muslim girls and boys%0D%0Adisobeying their parents and say that they are of legal age and wish to%0D%0Aimplement 'their rights' of living with the boyfriend and girlfriend. How%0D%0Amany we times have heard of children telling their parent, 'I will do as I%0D%0Aplease,' 'I will dress as I please,' 'I will go where I please and with who%0D%0AI please.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThe 'coolness of our eyes' are now becoming the fuels of the fire of%0D%0AJahannum, instead of becoming our intercessor and the means of our%0D%0Asalvation.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe give our children the secular education, which we hope will become the%0D%0Ameans of their success in this economically and socially advanced Dunyaa,%0D%0Ayet we forget the Islamic education, which would gain us the eternal bliss%0D%0Aof the Aakhirat. We do not say that secular education itself is evil. But we%0D%0Astrive so hard in secular education that Islamic education takes the back%0D%0Aseat and given no importance. In the endervour to attain secular education,%0D%0Awe leave no stone unturned. We send our children to such schools which have%0D%0Athese non-Islamic characteristics and principles. Our children mix with the%0D%0Anon-Muslims and learn their evil habits and ways. There is free%0D%0Aintermingling of sexes even before the age of cognisance. The habit is%0D%0Aformulated and when they become of age, the inner passions take control.%0D%0AThese children share their sandwiches and lunch with each other. The%0D%0Asituation is like putting a person who wants to gain name and fame with a%0D%0Agroup of people who have the rituals. Sooner or later, he becomes as his%0D%0Acompanions. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has said that sitting with%0D%0Athe pious is better than sitting alone and sitting alone is better than%0D%0Asitting in evil company.%0D%0A%0D%0AEffort should be made for the child to get secular education but in an%0D%0Aenvironment conducive to his Islamic welfare even if it means sacrificing%0D%0Athe level of his secular education. More effort should be emphasised on%0D%0AIslamic education and ethics. In so doing, we only seek Allah's pleasure and%0D%0Aeternal bliss.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
