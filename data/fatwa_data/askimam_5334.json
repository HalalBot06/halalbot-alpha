  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer below our standard reply to similar queries.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AQ: A person is heavily indebted to the bank by way of overdraft and to%0D%0Aprivate business houses. Is Hajj compulsory upon him? If not, can he perform%0D%0AHajj?%0D%0AA: It is forbidden to engage in any interest bearing transactions. As long%0D%0Aas a person is involved in an overdraft, he will be incurring sin.%0D%0AHajj is compulsory on a person who has the financial means to travel to%0D%0AMakkah Mukarramah and be able to maintain himself there and his dependants%0D%0A(if any) at home. As for other debts, if a person is heavily indebted and%0D%0Ahis liabilities exceed his assets, Hajj is not compulsory upon that person.%0D%0AIf he fulfils his monthly commitments and his creditors do not have any%0D%0Aarrears claim against him, he will not be infringing on the rights of his%0D%0Acreditors by performing Hajj on condition that he is sincere in fulfilling%0D%0Athe remaining amount according to the commitments. If the creditors have%0D%0Aarrears claims against him, he will be infringing on their rights by%0D%0Aperforming Hajj. Hence, he cannot perform Hajj unless he receives the prior%0D%0Aconsent of his creditors claiming arrears from him."
