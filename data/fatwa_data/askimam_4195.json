  "question": "Assalamu alaikum, Please clarify with evidences from scholars regarding the punishment Allah(SWT) inflicted on some jews, turning them into Apes/Swines, & splitting of the moon by our Prophet(SAW).",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI believed them to be literal events but a brother informed me of alternative explanations. He gave the following as proof that Allah (SWT) did not literally transform the Jews, physically, but only gave them characteristics of Apes and swines. \"They were not actually transformed into apes, only their hearts were changed.\" (Mujahid) \"God has used the expression figuratively.\" (Kathir) He also said that the following differing explanations regarding the splitting of the moon: He said Radi, Ibn ?Abbas, and Shah ?Abd al-Aziz gave the opinion it was a lunar eclipse. He said Ghazali and Shah Wali Allah hold the view that the moon had not really split in two and support a mass hallucination (vision) theory of the event. The brother I spoke to believes an alternative explanation, that the moon was hit by a meteor / comet in the 7th century which caused the impression that the moon split into two. Please could you present what you believe is the strongest view on each of these and explain how scholars could have such a different view on the same event?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The accepted opinion in this regard is that they were ape-like features.\nAllah Ta'ala turned them into ape-like beings although in perception and\nunderstanding they remained humans.\n2. The moon did split physically into two distinct parts as proven from\nauthentic Ahaadith. Searching for a logical explanation defeats the very\npurpose of a prophetic miracle.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nfor: FATWA DEPT."
