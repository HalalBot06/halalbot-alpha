  "answer": "QUESTION\nasalamualaikum rahmatullah wabarakatuhu is it allowed to change ones name if everyone keeps calling them by a nickname? jazakalla\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt has been reported in a Hadith that Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Asaid that on the day of Qiyaamat, 'you will be called by your names and the%0D%0Anames of your fathers, therefore, keep good names.' (Mishkaat)%0D%0A%0D%0AOn various occasions, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) changed the names%0D%0Aof sometimes his own family members because of their meanings being%0D%0Ainappropriate. Similarly, once Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) changed%0D%0Athe nickname of a person to another nickname because of inappropriate%0D%0Ameaning. If the person is not offended by people calling him that nickname,%0D%0Aon condition that his nickname is not just some shortform of his original%0D%0Aname, etc. but it has a good meaning, then there is no harm in keeping the%0D%0Anickname. However, if the nickname is some sort of a stylist short form of%0D%0Athe original name which holds absolutely no meaning at all, then it will be%0D%0Abetter to change the name.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0Afor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
