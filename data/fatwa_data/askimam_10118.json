  "question": "i am a baligh female. i have gold jewlery from my parents that only i wear and its for me after i get married. who has to pay zakaat on it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nand its for me after i get married. it is kind of understood between us taht it is for me. so my question is who has to pay zakaat on it? me or my parents? so far they have been giving zakaat on it.(i have read that others can pay zakaat for someone but with their consent). but my parents never asked me about it. so is zakaat paid for previous years for the jewlery that i wear? starting now, who should pay zakaat on it since now i own some money too? me or my parents? 2. would you know the minimum zakaat amount in USA dollars, if so please could you tell me? jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) You are an adult and own jewellery. It is your responsibility to discharge the Zakaat of your jewellery. Your parents may also discharge the Zakat on your behalf with your express or indicative consent. If you were aware that your parents were discharging your zakat and they assumed you granting consent to that, then the Zakat will be discharged. In future, we advise your parents inform you expressly before discharging zakat on your behalf.\n\n2) We are in South Africa and do not know the minimum zakatable amount in U.S.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
