  "question": "Why do masjids in South Africa not cater for females ? Why do alims stop women from going to masjids ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn a recent jummah bayaan the Imam of a mosque asked why do mosjids not cater for women. And it is wrong to stop women from going to the masjids if they cater for females. Please quote ahadith to substantiate your answer Jazakallah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDuring the time of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), women used to attend%0D%0Athe Musjid. Despite this, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) still%0D%0Aencouraged women to perform their Salaat in the privacy of their homes.%0D%0AHowever, he did not prevent them from attending the Musjid. This was so%0D%0Abecause people of those days were strong in faith and staunch followers of%0D%0ADeen. There was no immodesty and shamelessness among the women in the time%0D%0Aof Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). they knew and understood the%0D%0Acommandments of Allah Ta'ala and were very particular in fulfilling the%0D%0Aobligations of the Shari'ah. Despite all this, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) is reported to have said that the best place for a woman to%0D%0Aperform her Salat is in the seclusion of her home. (Musnad Ahmad vol.6%0D%0Apg.297)%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, we find that later on, during the time of the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhum), women were directly prevented from attending the Musjid due to%0D%0Avarious reasons. This was in no way a conflicting view to that of Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) for the simple reason that those factors, on%0D%0Athe basis of which the Sahaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) laid down this directive%0D%0Awere such factors which were not prevalent in the time of Nabi (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam). In short, the factors were the fear of evil and%0D%0Acorruption. It was for this very same reason that Hadhrat Aaisha%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anha) was reported to have said that if the Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) were to witness the conditions around which%0D%0Awomen attend the Musjid in our times, he would have certainly prohibited it.%0D%0A(Bukhari vol.1 pg.120)%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen this is what Hadhrat Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha) says with regards to%0D%0Awomen attending the Musjid in her time where evil and corruption were far%0D%0Alesser than in our times, what will it be like today? It is for this reason%0D%0Athat the Ulama strictly prohibit women from attending the Musjid.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
