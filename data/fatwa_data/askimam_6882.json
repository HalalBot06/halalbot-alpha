  "question": "Is it permissible for me to get married with an interest based loan to stop commiting fornication ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am suffering very much and have no one to speak to about my problems. Alhamdolillah i came accross your web page. I am 20 years old studying in uni, and going through a lot of trouble i am having extreme difficulty controlling my nafs. I have committed fornication 6 times and still tempted to do more. If i don?t get married i am going to carry on the same way. But i am unable to get married because of financial constraints. The only way i can get some money is through loan from the high street banks. Which is with interest as you know. I have tried to get karz-e-hasana from people but i have failed. Is it permissible to use the loan. If it is allowed for me, will it be haram to buy general personal things before the marriage, things like food, clothe utilities etc. I know that it is possible to get married for only 100 ponds but it is impossible for me because in England minimum you require is 4-5 thousand pound and my parents r not practising either, Please try to understand me, and also please forgive me for disclosing such things.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThese are all Shaytaani thoughts. You are able to control your Nafs. Will you do this despicable deed before your parents? Obviously not.\n\nThis shows that you do have control of your Nafs. Remember, Allah is watching you all the time. When you intend doing something like this, bring the fear of Allah into your heart. If you are unable to marry, fast daily as long as it takes to break your desires.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
