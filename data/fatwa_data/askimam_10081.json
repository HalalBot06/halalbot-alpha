  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy question is in the month of ramadhan many masajids perform shabeena, which is the completion of the Quran in three nights. Is this permissible? Sunnah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf this 'Shabeena' is performed as a Nafl Jamaat (after having taken part in the Sunnah Taraweeh already), then it is Makrooh-e-Tahrimi (very close to Haraam).\n\nHowever, if it is performed as the Sunnah Taraaweeh of that night (i.e. the participants have not already performed that nights Taraweeh already), or the Jamaat consists of lesser than four people, it is permissible. (Fataawa DarulUloom Vol 4 Pg 284 Darul Ishaa'at)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT."
