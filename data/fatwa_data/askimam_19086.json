  "question": "My wife did not have wudhu during tawaaf while on Hajj and Umrah. What should we do now?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAlhamdulillah, I went for Hajj with my family in 2004. My wife had a  discharge, (not the monthly one), which nullified her wudhu. At that time she was unaware that a discharge breaks wudhu.\n\nAs a result, she performed Tawaf Ziyaarah, Tawaaf Wida, Tawaaf Umrah, and  several nawaafil tawaaf without wudhu.\n\nDoes she need to offer damm for these tawaaf, so we can request our friends  who are going for hajj this year. Also what will be niyaah for this damm, and do we need to mention her name for damm.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nTawaaf Ziyaarah:\n\nIf all or most of the Tawaaf Ziyaarah was performed without wudhu, then damm will be compulsory.\n\n\nIf less than half of the Tawaaf Ziyaarah (3 or less circuits around the Kabah) was performed without wudhu, half a Saa' (1.75kg to 2.32 kg / 3.86 lb to 5.11 lb) of wheat (or its monetary equivalent which is equal to the amount given for Sadaqat-ul-Fitr) will have to be given as Sadaqah for every circuit performed without wudhu.1\n\nTawaaf Widaa & Nafl Tawaaf:\n\nIf the Tawaaf Widaa or any Nafl Tawaaf was performed without wudhu, half a Saa' (1.75kg to 2.32 kg / 3.86 lb to 5.11 lb) of wheat (or its monetary equivalent which is equal to the amount given for Sadaqat-ul-Fitr) will have to be given as Sadaqah for every circuit performed without wudhu.2  .\n\n \n\nTawaaf Umrah:\n\nIf any circuit of the Tawaaf of Umrah was performed without wudhu, then a damm will be compulsory.3\n\n\nThe damm has to be given inside the Haram. The word damm refers to the slaughtering of a goat, a sheep or a one-seventh part of a cow or a camel within the precincts of the Haram in lieu of certain violations made while performing the manaasik (rites) of Hajj.4 5\n\nThe person performing the damm will make the intention of performing the damm on behalf of your wife.\n\n\nThe Sadaqah can be given outside the Haram.\n\n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMl.
