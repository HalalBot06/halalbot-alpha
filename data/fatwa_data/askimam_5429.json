  "question": "Can I spend in charity, Hajj Fardh, Marraige and going out for 4 months under these circumstances and expect Sawaab and forgiveness and Help from Allah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have the following issues 1) I have occassionally free time in my company at work which I have spent most of it looking at Islamic websites using their resources. Is that Haraam if such an act is not prevented by and employee contract. They do say in their ethics training that we should not use company time/property for personal use. Do I have to pay them back for this? How to solve this issue. 2) I have some Mu'aamalaat issues with my company in that I have not been able to work full 40 hours required by them. This was due to sometimes being tired or because I have to during winter, go for Salaah 3 times due to compressed timings and that made me not want to stay an actual 10-11 hours at work. How can I solve this issue. I understand it was due to my laziness. Do I have to pay back the company for this time not worked? I did complete the work in all above cases. They are extremely happy with my job performance but, it is just a matter of the hours. We work based on hours at work as well as work completed. Please make clear if I can spend in the charities, Hajj Fardh, marraige and 4 months while above matters are not cleared and it may be needed to still compensate the people for their time from my bank account. Do I need to clear the issue before I can spend in the way of Allah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. You should firstly contact the company and enquire if usage of their\nresources is allowed. If they permit it, you may continue. However, if they\nare not keen on employees utilizing their resources, you should desist\nimmediately and pay them back for whatever you had utilized. Employ your\ndiscretion and determine a fair value of what you had used and pay it back.\n2. This is clearly a breach of contract. You were required to work 40 hours\nand you failed to do so. Consult the company and if they overlook or forgive\nyou, well and good. If they insist that you complete the hours or pay them\nback, you should do so.\n3. Yes, you may spend in charity or other things mentioned. However, it is\nbetter to clear these affairs first and then spend in charities, etc.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
