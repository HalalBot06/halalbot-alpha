  "question": "Is kidney transplant permissible?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a daughter who was born with a kidney and other problems and is considered disabled person. She is now 23 years old and her kidney have got worse. Only about 18% of her kidneys are now functioning. The doctors are advising that she either will have to go onto Dialysis or kidney transplant if her kidney function drops to 15% or below.\n\nCan you please advise me as to what shari῾āh says on kidney transplant? Are we allowed to do kidney transplant from a kidney donated by a dead person? Are we allowed to do kidney transplant from a living person, i.e., could I donate one of my kidney to my daughter  as doctors say that a person can live a normal life on one kidney.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykumwa-rahmatullāhiwa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\nIf any ill person reaches a stage that a specific organ becomes unusable(to such an extent that if a organ from another human being is not replaced, then there is an immediate danger of loss of life, then in this dire need a human organ transplant will be permissible.[1]\n\nWhen a perfectly healthy person on the advice of an expert physician confirms that the removal of one kidney will not harm nor cause ill-health whatsoever, then it will be permissible with the condition that the kidney be donated and not sold.\n\nTherefore, it is permissible for you to pursue your daughter’s kidney transplant.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Zaid Mohammed Shelia,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nUSA\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\n\n\n\n(2020-06-11)\n\n\n\n\n[1] امرأة حامل ماتت فاضطرب الولد في بطنها فإن كان أكبر رأيه أنه حي يشق بطنها لأن ذلك تسبب في إحياء نفس محترمة بترك تعظيم الميت فالإحياء أولى.. البحر الرائق 8/ 205 أيج أيم سعيد\n\nجديد فقهى مسائل5/59-45 زمزم\n\nآپ کے مسائل اور ان کا حل 9/141-133 مکتبہ لدھیانوی"
