  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam Aleikoum We know Surat El Wakiaa has the benefit that the poverty will never touch the one who read it at night before heading to bed ? Could you please give me other benefits form other Surat ??. Like for instance the benefit of having a peace of mind ? been blessed with a pious wife and pious children ?etc ?. Jazak Allah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSurah Faatiha has been mentioned to being the cure to all sickness.\n\nSurah Baqarah removes Shaitaan from the house in which it is read.\n\nAyat Kursi when read before sleep gets one a protecting angel from Allah and prevents Shaitan from nearing one.\n\nSurah Mulk saves one from punishment in the grave and intercedes for its reader until he is forgiven.\n\nSurah Yaseen when read at the start of the day, makes all the work of the day easy. (Mishkaat Pg. 183-190-Qadeemi)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
