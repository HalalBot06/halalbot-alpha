  "question": "What should I do? My niece has offered my house to be used for filming a movie. If I donate the money to charity, will this venture be acceptable?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy niece has offered my house to be used for filming a movie. As it is an Indian movie, there will be no kissing scenes etc.It is very prestigious to have a movie filmed in one's house, and one can be compensated with a lot of money. If I donate the money to charity, will this venture be acceptable? If I loaned my house to my niece? If I let the studio use my house for free, just for the publicity? I would hate to disappoint my niece.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou speak about disappointing your niece. What about annoying Allah Ta?ala our Creator?\n\nLoaning your house out for a vile cause such as a movie shoot is not permissible, even if you let it out for free. Instead of pinning your hopes on the transitory benefits of this world, focus on the eternal benefits of the hereafter.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
