  "question": "What to do after having a child out of wedlock?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Mufti Sahib, When I was young and not a strict practising muslim, I had a child out of wedlock with a non-muslim woman. May Allah forgive me. A couple of years later we had an Islamic marriage performed. 2 years ago, when the child was 10, my wife was guided by Allah and accepted Islam, Alhamdulillah. 1) Is the child considered illigetimate? 2) What can I do to make up for my mistake? 3) What should I tell the child when the subject comes up? 4) Can I mislead people who don't know about my not being married at the time in order to hide my sin, or should I tell the truth? 5) Should my wife and I have our marriage re-done since she has accepted Islam? Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari'ah, one may have a relationship only in a Nikah\n(marriage). A relationship out of Nikah is prohibited. Therefore, the\noffspring of a legitimate relationship will be honoured as opposed to an\nillegitimate relationship.\n\nShari'ah has advised to perform good and virtuous deeds. It is hoped that\nwill also compensate for one's sins. May Allah Ta'ala accept your efforts in\nguiding the woman to Islam and make that a compensation for the mistakes of\nthe past, Aameen.\n\nShari'ah has prohibited from disclosing one's faults to another. Therefore,\nyou should not inform people of the details of the child. As regards the\nIslamic marriage to the woman, if she was a Christian or Jew, then the Nikah\nis valid or else you should perform Nikah with her again.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
