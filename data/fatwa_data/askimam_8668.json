  "answer": "QUESTION\ni notice that when people ask you for proof from the quran in regard to your answers, you answer with more hadith. then you quote quran ayat about hadith in general. you are not acceding to the questionaires request for PROOF FROM THE QURAN FOR YOUR ANSWER.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe wish to inform you that we do not answer any queries from unreliable sources. Your question has already been answered previously from reliable and authentic sources.\n\nIt is impossible to answer every singly question directly and explicitly from the Qur?aan. The Qur?aan does not answer each and every singly petty argument. If it happened to be so, you would have probably taken 10 years to complete one full recitation. The Qur?an is a comprehensive divine scripture of Allah Ta?ala which lays down basic rules and principles, which Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) by way of example, practically demonstrated to us.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
