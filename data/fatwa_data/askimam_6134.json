  "question": "Regarding hadith,it seems there are some that are deemed \"reliable\" and \"Unreliable\",which hadith are binding ? Please be specific.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA Hadith can be categorized with regards to its authenticity into basically%0D%0A4 types, 1) Sahih (authentic), 2) Hasan (sound), 3) Dha'eef (weak), 3.1) Dha%0D%0A'eef Jiddan (very weak), and 4) Mawdhoo (fabricated)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe first 2 types can be used as proofs for the different laws in Shari'ah.%0D%0AThe third can be used (with a few conditions attached) to establish virtues%0D%0Afor any specific deed or person. (This is accepted by the vast majority of%0D%0Athe Muhadditheen).%0D%0A%0D%0A3.1 and 4 cannot be used for anything besides for the purpose of explaining%0D%0Ato somebody it's classification. They cannot be quoted in any lecture, book,%0D%0Aetc. with the intention of inspiring people through its contents. Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'He who lies (about a speech) of mine%0D%0Ashould prepare his abode in the fire.' (Bukhari)%0D%0A%0D%0AHence, the Ulama have deduced that it is Haraam (forbidden) for one to quote%0D%0Aany fabricated Hadith without explicitly mentioning its fabrication. As for%0D%0A3.1 (very weak, which is also referred to by the words, 'very unreliable'),%0D%0Abecause of it being so weak, the Ulama have joined it to Mawdhoo%0D%0A(fabricated) Ahaadith. So, they share the same law as mentioned above. (For%0D%0Afurther reference, see Sharh Nukhbatul Firk of Haafiz ibn Hajar;%0D%0ATadreeburraawiy of Haafiz Suyyooti and; Al-Ajwibatul fadhilah of Ml.
