  "answer": "QUESTION\nis it alright to masterbate if you cannot hold yourself back from having sex?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nOne should stay away from all those things that enhances a persons sexual urge. Stay away from T.V, nude adverts, magazines, and casting glances at women. The above would curb ones desires to a large extent as ones desires are aroused through the evils around us. The prescribed method of suppressing ones desires is fasting. It is therefore not permissible to masturbate. How would one want to have Haram sex? Simply stay away from that avenue.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
