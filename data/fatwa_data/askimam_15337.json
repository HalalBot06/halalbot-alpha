  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan i install a vending machine that dispenses coke, juice water etc, in the mosque building, not officially the designated mosque area but near the washroom. Musalees and student would buy the drinks and 20% of profit would go to support the mosque which would also cover the electricity the machine uses. Is this business in the mosque permissible?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is not permissible to install a vending machine in that area of the masjid which is designated for salaah, whether it is the inner masjid or the courtyard of the masjid.\n\nHowever, if the machine is installed in a place which is not designated for salaah (e.g. the shoe-rack area or the ablution area), then it will be permissible; on condition that it does not violate the integrity of the masjid and is not a cause of hindrance for the musallees.\n\nFatawa Mahmoodiyah Vol: 2 Pg:461 & Vol:12 Pg:303 (Kutub Khana Mazhari)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
