  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMaking up of Missed Salats\n\nOnce after I have prayed my Maghrib Salat I was going for a official meeting. On the way I felt some stickiness in my underwear, and realized that my salat might not be valid. So I decided to repeat it after my meeting. However the meeting continued till Isha time and I could not repeat the Maghrib Salat on time. . 2) On another occassion, I was in another town with my wife, and we were far way from my relatives house. I could not find a suitable place to keep my wife and pray Asr Salat. So we decided to goto my relative house. Just when we reached my realtives house, the Maghrib Adhan was heard and I could not pray Asr Salat on time. I want to know what is the make up for these Salats. JazakaAllah Khair\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf a person misses a Salaat, then on remembering he should immediately make Qadhaa of it as soon as possible as it is a sin to delay offering a Qadhaa Salaat without any valid excuse. Therefore, you should make up for the Asr and Maghrib Salaats missed by performing them as soon as possible. When performing Qadhaa Salaat, the following intention should be made, ‘Oh Allah, I am performing the Qadhaa of such and such days – Asr or Maghrib’.\n\nIf a person has to make up for many missed Salaat or doesn’t remember the day the Salaat was missed, then one should make the intention, ‘Oh Allah, I am performing the first Fajr or the first Dhuhr Fardh from those which I missed.’\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
