  "question": "Give shahdah in front of witness necessary if of weak faith?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nGive shahdah in front of witness necessary if of weak faith?\n\ni was born and raised a muslim. but there were times which i am sure brought me out of islam, and i tried to regain my faith and ask for forgiveness. i am still trying. but those moments that i was out of islam, i just asked Allah for forgiveness during salat. i said the shahdah while raising my finger too when i prayed. but the times i came out of islam, does that mean my salat doesn't count because i didn't give shahadah in front of a witness but i just said it on my own in my head/heart and during prayer?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAt the outset, it is important to understand that this fear of yours is certainly a sign of imaan within you. It is only because of the spark of imaan in your heart that you are experiencing this fear. Furthermore, this is one of the plots of Shaytaan to mislead you. He uses excuses of this nature to frustrate individuals until they leave the fold of Islam and become non Muslims. Therefore, it is important that you do not fall victim of his plots and cause unnecessary instability within you. Whenever such thoughts come to you, you should seek refuge in Allah from Shaytaan and recite the kalimah La Ilaha Illalaahu Muhamadur Rasulullah as often as possible. You should ignore these whispers and do not entertain them at all.\n\nAccording to Shariah, there is absolutely no need to have a witness when saying the Shahadah. Perform your Salaah and recite the Quraan as often as possible. If you occupy yourself in these acts of worship, shaytaan will not have an opportunity to inject his plots in you. Make Dua to Allah that He keeps you steadfast on Imaan and save you from the evil whispers of Shaytaan the accursed. Ameen\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
