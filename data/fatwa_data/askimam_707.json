  "question": "Is it required to fold the corner of a prayer mat when not performing salat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI've heard several people telling me that when one is not presently praying on a prayer rug, that person should fold one corner so that Satan does not do any harm to your prayer. Is this true or is this biddat made up by others?Jazak-Allah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPeople generally fold the prayer mat when not in use just as anything else,\nfor example, clothing not in use is folded and kept away.\n\nIt is not a Shar'ee requirement. The Musallas in the Musjid are open and are\nbe folded.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
