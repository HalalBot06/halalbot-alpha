  "answer": "QUESTION\nkindly inform me whether a quranic teacher can perform his class as follows: There is a group of student of about 20 to 30. Each child reads a part of the holy quran and the others follow him. each and every student has his turn and each and everyone has to follow. They continue reading it everyday until they complete the holy Quran. My questions are: (1) Is this type of teaching of the Holy Quran permitted? (2) Do all the students get the reward of making Khatm ul Quraan?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThis method of teaching is permissible as long as the teacher corrects the mistakes relating to tajweed. After the Quran is completed, it will be as though everyone completed it.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
