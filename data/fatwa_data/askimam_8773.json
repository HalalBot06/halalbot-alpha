  "question": "1) Is it permissible to pray the salaat perhaps 15-30 mins early?, 2) when I am older and am seeking a wife, is it ok to date in order to seek a wife?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn my school, we must pray our Jhuma in the school. BUt they have temporarily changed the lunchtime. Is it permissible to pray the salaat perhaps 15-30 mins early? Will we be forgiven or should we not pray at all and pray Zuhr at home? It goes for any prayer, can we pray any prayer a few mins early and still be forgiven? Also, when I am older and am seeking a wife, is it ok to date in order to seek a wife?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The commencing time for Jumu?ah is after Zawaal (midday). Jumu?ah cannot be performed before Zawaal. Muslim students and their parents should arrange a meeting with the authorities of the school governing body and request for an adjustment in time in order to perform Jumu?ah and Dhuhr Salaat timeously. If the school refuses then, Dhuhr Salaat may be performed at home.\n\n2. Dating and every type of premarital relationship is Haraam (strictly prohibited). One may seek a wife within the limits and boundaries stipulated by Shari?ah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
