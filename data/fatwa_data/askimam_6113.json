  "question": "Is it Good or Disrespectful to ask Allah s.w.t. to pass on the reward of your good deed to the Prophet s.a.w.s.?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIsaal-e-Sawaab (to perform a virtuous act and grant the reward to any\nperson, alive or deceased) is permissible. On numerous occasions, Nabi\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised the Sahaaba (Radhiyallaahu Anhum) to\ngive charity on behalf of the deceased.\n\nOne specific incident is of Hadhrat Abu Talha (Radhiallaahy Anhu) when the\nAayat, 'You cannot attain virtue until your spend what is beloved to you.'\n(Nisaa 4). Abu Talha gave his most valuable well and garden, Bi'r Haa as\ncharity on behalf of his deceased mother. In fact, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu\nAlayhi Wasallam) slaughtered 100 sheep during his farewell Hajj and made\nintention for himself and all those (alive, deceased and to come) who bring\nfaith on his prophethood. (Nasbur Raaya, Allama Zailee). One may recite the\nQur'aan, or any Dhikr or Du'aa and make intention of giving the reward to\nthe deceased.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
