These are physical aspects and although Du?aas, etc. are useful you should consult your doctor and take his opinion.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Sunnis have different meanings countries. If you refer to people who follow the Ahlus sunnah wal Jamaa, then there is no specific Madhab which they follow. They may follow any of the four Madhabs, viz. Hanafi, Shaafi?ee, Maaliki and Hanbaliy. Refer attached.%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) did not follow any Madhab. These Madhabs refer to the following: Hanafis ? follow the rulings of Imaam Nu?maan ibn Thaabit Abu Hanifa, Shaafi?ees ? follow the rulings of Imaam Muhammad ibn Idrees al-Shaafi?ee, Maaliki ? follow the rulings of Imaam Maalik ibn Anas Maaliki, Hanbaliy ? follow the rulings of Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. It is correct to perform the Qadha after Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib and Esha Salaats. (Hidaaya vol.1 pg.84; Ilmiyya). It is Makrooh to perform Qadhaa during, a) From sunrise till about 10 minutes after sunrise, b) At the time of Zawaal (midday), and c) From about 15 minutes before sunset until after Maghrib Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0Afor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
