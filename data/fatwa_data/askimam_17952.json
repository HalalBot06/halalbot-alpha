  "question": "Allah can make a person do good or bad?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nOne of my friend tells that one person need the wish of Allah to be able to do somthing good or bad.What i feel is that the person  should have the intention of doing anything good or bad in his heart and he should try accordingly. then if Allah wishes the same he can be  successful. He says that whether the person will intend or not and also whether he will try or not also  depends on Allah's wish. Please clarify the standing in the light of islam. \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nWhen Allah Ta’ala intended to create each thing, He determined when it would come into existence and when it would cease to exist. He also determined its qualities and nature. In addition, everything in the universe, the seen and the unseen, is completely subject to the power of Allah. Nothing can happen outside the will of Allah Ta’ala.\n\nIn the Quran, Allah Ta'ala says:\n\nوكان أمر الله قدرا مقدورا\n\n\"And Allah's command is pre-determined by destiny.\" (33:38)\n\nWe do not know our future and, to a large extent, cannot control it. However, we can make decisions within the limits of what we can control, based on our understanding of the way the world works. If someone chooses to jump off a roof, he cannot claim any injustice if he is injured. He knows that the drop from the roof to the ground will injure him or even worse cause him death. This is the reality, yet the ultimate reality is that Allah Ta’ala can place the roof and the ground onto one level just before he thinks of jumping.\n\nThe Qadriyyah believe that a human has full power to do whatever he wishes; he is not bound by taqdeer. For example, if a person wishes to do any action good or bad he does so with his own free will and power. On the contrary, the Jahmiyyah believe that a person has no power at all. He is no more than a stone or brick.\n\nThe Ahlus Sunnah adopts a moderate path. It is our belief that taqdeer refers to the absolute knowledge of Allah Ta’ala. Everything in this world will happen according to the perfect knowledge of Allah Ta’ala and nothing can go against that. However, a human being is given a choice to do whatever he wishes,good or bad. It is precisely for this, he will be rewarded or punished. Whatever he will ultimately choose is known by Allah Ta’ala. The knowledge of Allah Ta’ala does not mean that Allah will impose against the wish of the individual.\n\nWhen Hazrat Ali ibn Abi Talib (RadiyAllahu Anhu) was caliph, he was asked about a matter while he was standing on the pulpit, to which he responded, \"I don't know.\" It was said to him, \"How can you ascend this pulpit and say you do not know?\" His reply was, \"I ascended it according to my knowledge of things, had I ascended it according to my level of ignorance, I would have reached the heavens.\" This statement emphasizes that mankind can only reach a certain level of understanding, even at the most advanced level, and that true knowledge is to recognize the limit of one's knowledge, intellect, and understanding.\n\nOur Ulema advise us concerning the aspect of taqdeer-destiny, not to delve into it, as it is an ocean with no end. Allah Ta’ala has created the human mind such that it would not comprehend the vastness relating to this facet of life. It is a topic that should not be discussed excessively and the most intelligent person is the one who distances his thoughts from this subject.\n\nWe should make abundance of duaa asking Allah Ta’ala to guide us towards that which is good and beneficial, and save us from that which is evil and detrimental to our Aakhirat.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
