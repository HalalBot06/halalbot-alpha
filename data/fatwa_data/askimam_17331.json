  "question": "My question is, is it haraam for us to continue to live in England?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy Husband and I have a very difficult relationship with his family.  His Family moved to Pakistan 4 years ago, and think that my husband is wrong to continue living in a non-muslim country.  My husband is a very pious man mashallah.  He prays all salats in the masjid, he devotes 2 hours a day , 3 days a month and 40 days a year to doing dawah.  I also spend 40 days a year in the path of Allah.\n\nWe would not be able to do this if we lived with his family.  In fact they frown upon me for doing purdah, and ask me to take off my hijaab if guests are coming or for me to stay away (which i do)!  They pray salaah alhamdulilah, and are knowledgable about islam, but are tradtional pakistanis also.\n\nMy husbands work is also here, as is my family, and our network of muslims.\n\nMy question is, is it haraam for us to continue to live in England?  We were both born and raised here.  Pakistan is not really home for us.  My husband sends money and gifts to his family, visits them regularly and phones them everyday.  His brother lives with the family so they are not in need of a mehram.   Please give a detailed response as my inlaws keep saying we are hypocrites to spend time on deen and then to disobey them,\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh  \n\nAt the outset, we commend you and your husband in your commitment in adhering to Deen. We make Dua that Allah grants you Istiqamah, Ameen.\n\nAccording to Shariah, if you are able to fulfil your religious obligations in a non Muslim country, there is no need to migrate to a “Muslim” country. just as any democratic dispensation affords its citizens the freedom to practice their religion without any fear, hindrance or intimidation. Therefore it is not necessary to migrate to on the pretext that is a non Muslim country. It is our observation that at times people who migrate to countries where there is little or no Deen, they tend to practice their Deen more than they would in their so called Muslim country. It is a natural phenomenon of life that anything which is found in abundance and is easily available holds less regard and importance. For example, water is easily available and found in abundance hence the importance and regard for water is little compared to precious commodities and items. Likewise is the issue of Deen in a “Muslim” country. Due to the abundance of Ulama, Masaajid and Islamic institutes, people tend to show laxity and Allah forbid, some show disregard to Deen. However, when these very same citizens of “Muslim” countries travel and settle abroad, and experience the scarcity and absence of Deen, they become troubled and change to become better practicing Muslims. Therefore if you are free to practice your Deen in any part of the world, it is not necessary to migrate to any country that claims to be “Islamic”.\n\nYou state that your husband still maintains contact with his family and strives to fulfil their rights and obligations. You should support your husband in fulfilling his duties and do not allow this incident to destabilize your marriage. Your husband should explain to his family with wisdom and diplomacy that he has decided to remain in the in the best interest of his family and children and his decision should not be considered as hypocritical.\n\nWe are not sure of your specific situation but sometimes you would just have to close your ears and tolerate certain comments to maintain the peace and stability in the family.\n\nContinue with your life and pay attention on serving your husband and children. You should also respect your in laws and win them over with your Akhlaaq and character.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
