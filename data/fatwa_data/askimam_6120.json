  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer below our standard article to similar queries.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ABAY'AT IN SHARI'AH%0D%0AReality of Bay'at in Shariah%0D%0AThe proof of taking the Bay'at is abundantly found in the Aayat of the Holy%0D%0AQur'aan, and in the noble sayings of our beloved Prophet, Rasulullah%0D%0ASallallahu Alayhi Wasallam.%0D%0A%0D%0ATwo Aayat of the Holy Qur'aan are presented as examples:%0D%0A%0D%0AThose who are swearing allegiance unto thee (Muhammad) In reality they are%0D%0Aswearing allegiance to Allah the Exalted, because the object of this%0D%0Aallegiance is to obey the Commandments of Allah the Exalted, and when this%0D%0Ais so, then the hand of Allah is above their hands. Then (after allegiance)%0D%0AIf anyone who would break his oath or covenant (that will exhibit opposition%0D%0Ainstead of obedience) then the punishment of breaking the covenant will fall%0D%0Aon him, and he who fulfills the covenant which he has made with Allah (in%0D%0Ahis \"Oath of Allegiance\") then Allah will bestow on him an immense reward in%0D%0Anear future. (Al-Qur'aan 48:10)%0D%0A%0D%0AO! Nabi Muhammad Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam when the Muslim women come to%0D%0Ayou (with the object) of taking the Bay'at (Oath of Allegiance) on the%0D%0Afollowing points that they will not join any partner with Allah the Exalted,%0D%0Awill not commit theft, nor commit adultery, nor kill their children, nor%0D%0Awill produce any illegitimate child forging falsely (that it Is from the%0D%0Asperm of their husband.) (In the age of ignorance, it was a custom of%0D%0AArabian women to rear up a child of someone else, and claimed that it was%0D%0Athe child from their own husband, or committed fornication and the%0D%0Aillegitimate child so born was ascribed to their own husband, which besides%0D%0Athe major sin of adultery, the sin of ascribing the child of someone else,%0D%0Ato their husband is also involved on which great warning of punishment has%0D%0Abeen foretold in the sayings of Muhammad Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam as%0D%0Arelated to in Abu Dawood and Nisaai) and will not disobey you in Islamic%0D%0ACanonical Laws (which include all religious commandments. Then If those%0D%0Awomen accept all these conditions which form the basis of faith and acting%0D%0Aupon them, perfects one's faith) then accept their Bay'at and ask Allah to%0D%0Aforgive (the previous sins.) Verily Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.%0D%0A(Al-Qur'aan 60:12).%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Holy Qur'aan and the sayings of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam%0D%0Aare full of such references regarding the Bay'at. Presenting all of them%0D%0Ahere will make the subject very lengthy. Whilst I was in Madinah, I found a%0D%0Aspeech, in a cassette recording of the learned scholar, the late Maulana%0D%0AHusain Ahmad Madni Rahmatullah Alayh. I requested my spiritual guide to hear%0D%0Ait. After listening to it, he ordered that it be printed, which was%0D%0Asubsequently published under the title \"Shar'ee status of Bay'at\". This%0D%0Acontains many sayings of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam concerning%0D%0Athis subject. In one of the books of my Murshid (spiritual guide) entitled%0D%0A\"Inseparability of Islamic Canonical Law with that of spiritual Sufistic%0D%0AOrders%7E, many sayings of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam has been%0D%0Amentioned. Those who are interested should read those books.%0D%0A%0D%0ADefinition of Bay'at%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Shafi Rahmatullah Alayh writes: The words Bay'at in fact%0D%0Ameans to take a promise for performing some special deed. Its customary%0D%0Amethod according to the practical way Sunnah of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam Is to place the hands of both persons one on top of the other,%0D%0Aalthough placing the hands above one another is not compulsory. If you make%0D%0Aa promise to do something, then it becomes religiously incumbent on you to%0D%0Akeep it, and breaking your promise is unlawful. (Ma'areful Qur'aan)%0D%0A%0D%0AKinds of Bay'at%0D%0ARasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam had taken the Bay'at at different%0D%0Atimes on different occasions. He had taken such covenants, at the time of%0D%0Aaccepting Islam, or for performing actions according to all the Commandments%0D%0Aof Islam. Some times, Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam had taken the%0D%0ABay'at for abstaining or avoiding certain sins, or for doing particular%0D%0Adeeds.%0D%0A%0D%0AThus there are different kinds of Bay'at:%0D%0A%0D%0ABay'at for Islam: Is defined as when an infidel or a polytheist discards his%0D%0Aprevious convictions, seeks repentance and makes a covenant to accept Islam,%0D%0Ait is called Bay'at in Islam.%0D%0A%0D%0ABay'at for Jihad: This was done at the time of Be'it Ridwan In Hudaibiyah%0D%0Awhen Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam had taken Bay'at from his Sahaba%0D%0ARadiallahu an hum, that if there would be a need of fighting against the%0D%0Aenemies of Islam, then they would not desert the battlefield, but would face%0D%0Athe enemy until the end.%0D%0A%0D%0ABay'at for Caliphate: This is the Oath of Allegiance accepting a Vying%0D%0Aperson as the Caliph of the Muslims, who would rule over them. After the%0D%0Adeath of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam the Sahaba Radiallahu an hum%0D%0Aof Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam unanimously accepted Abu Bakr%0D%0ASiddiq Radiallahu anhu as their Caliph and took the Oath of his Allegiance,%0D%0Aand this system continued in this manner.%0D%0A%0D%0ABay'at against committing major sins: As has been stated above with%0D%0Areference to Ayah 12 of Surah 6O.%0D%0A%0D%0AThere are many incidents in the Ahadith of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam that he took an Oath of Allegiance from men and women that they%0D%0Awould not make NOHA*.%0D%0A%0D%0ATaking an Oath for performing Islamic deeds: Auf bin Malik AshJaee%0D%0ARadiallahu anhu relates that there were 8 or 9 persons sitting in the%0D%0Acompany of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam when he asked, \"Why do you%0D%0Anot take an Oath of NOHA.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AAllegiance on the hand of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam?\"%0D%0A%0D%0A\"We extended our hands, and asked him what was the issue on which we were to%0D%0Atake the Oath of Allegiance; O Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam?\"%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam said: \"On these issues: Worship only%0D%0AAllah and do not Join partners with Him, perform 5 daily prayers and hear%0D%0Aand obey all commands.\" Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam also added som%0D%0Ae thing in low tones, which was \"Do not beg anything from anyone\". The%0D%0Anarrator says that he had observed the Companions of Rasulullah Sallallahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam to the extent, that if the whip of a horse had dropped from%0D%0Atheir hands, they would not ask anyone to pick it up for them, but would%0D%0Adismount and would pick up the whip themselves. (Hayatus Sahaba, Tabrani,%0D%0AAbu Nuaim, AlHakim, Al-Baihaqi and lbn Asakr etc.)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn this manner, there are clear proofs that Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam took Bay'at on the occasion of migration, victory, on death and on%0D%0Aother deeds and occasions.%0D%0A%0D%0ASaintly Oath of Allegiance: Regarding this Shah Waliullah Rahmatullah Alayh%0D%0Awrites in the book Al-Qaulul Jameel, the Bay'at which is inherited from the%0D%0ASaints (mystics) can be given for many purposes.%0D%0A%0D%0A1. The Bay'at to avoid committing sins and to make sincere repentance.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The Bay'at for blessing or benediction, which means to enter the fold of%0D%0Athe righteous people to attain auspiciousness, which is proved by a chain of%0D%0Aauthoritative sayings of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. The Bay'at for leaving overt or covert forbidden things, and making a%0D%0Afirm intention to act sincerely on Divine Commands, and attaching your heart%0D%0Ato Allah the Exalted and Sublime.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis third kind is most fundamental. In the first two kinds, the aim is to%0D%0Aleave all major sins without insisting on minor ones, and to practice all%0D%0Athe ways of ordained obedience, such as \"Sunnat Muakkadah\".%0D%0A%0D%0AThe breaking of this Oath will involve persisting on committing major or%0D%0Aminor infractions against ordained Commandments of obedience. In the third%0D%0Aone, fulfilling the Oath means continuous steadfastness for migration, or%0D%0Astriving in the path of Allah, or performing spiritual exercises, until one%0D%0Aattains a light of satisfaction, and it becomes his instinctive voluntary%0D%0Ahabit. In such a condition, he is allowed to enjoy certain things which are%0D%0Apermitted in the Canonical Law of Islam; or to keep himself busy in certain%0D%0Aactivities, the completion of which requires a long time, such as courses of%0D%0Areligious sciences or judicial matters. The breaking of Oath refers to the%0D%0Acondition of making it defective before achieving any enlightenment of the%0D%0Aheart. (Shariat-u-Tariqat Ka Talazum Pg. 124)%0D%0A%0D%0AThis type of Bay'at can be continuously traced since the days of Rasulullah%0D%0ASallallahu Alayhi Wasallam. In Quranic terminology it is called TAZKIYAH,%0D%0Aand in the tradition of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam it is called%0D%0AIHSAN which is mentioned in the \"Hadith of Jibraeel\". Later, it was entitled%0D%0Aas Tasawwuf or Mysticism. The order of spiritual leaders and their disciples%0D%0Ais an offshoot of this system. The four major tasks for which Rasulullah%0D%0ASallallahu Alayhi Wasallam was responsible, which are mentioned in 4 places%0D%0Ain the Holy Qur'aan. One of them Is Tazkiya (the purification of self) as%0D%0AAllah the Almighty says:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"It is He, who sent a Prophet for the illiterate people (of Arabia) who was%0D%0Afrom their own (nation), and who recites before them the Aayat of Divine%0D%0ARevelation, and purifies them (from false convictions, and immoral%0D%0Apractices) and teaches them the \"Book\" (Al-Qur'aan) and words of wisdom%0D%0A(which include all internal or external branches of religious sciences).\"%0D%0A(Surah 62 Ayah 2)%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam used to train and purify his Sahaba%0D%0ARadiallahu anhum. If he detected any special (spiritual) disease, he would%0D%0Apay special attention for its reformation, and adopt different methods for%0D%0Aits elimination. After the demise of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam%0D%0Athe Sahaba Radiallahu anhum used to take Bay'at and this system was%0D%0Acontinued by their followers, and the disciples of the followers. These%0D%0Aspiritual leaders then give permission to some to take the Bay'at who in%0D%0Aturn then can administer this oath to others provided he is granted%0D%0Aauthority. It is not permissible that everyone should administer the oath.%0D%0AThis privilege is reserved for those who have been given permission by a%0D%0Atrue spiritual leader.%0D%0A%0D%0ATrue Nature of Bay'at%0D%0AMaulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi Rahmatullah Alayh, a great scholar writes that the%0D%0Anature of Bay'at and the relation between Murshid (the spiritual guide) and%0D%0Ahis disciple is that the Murshid promises to instruct how to perform Zikr or%0D%0Akeep alive the remembrance of Allah, and act upon Divine orders. He also%0D%0Atries to diagnose the spiritual diseases of his disciples and prescribes%0D%0Aremedies for their treatment. The disciple gives an assurance that he will%0D%0Aact upon the advices and instructions of his Murshid. This reformation may%0D%0Abe achieved without the customary method of taking Bay'at. But becoming a%0D%0Adisciple (Mureed) of a spiritual guide in the customary manner has an%0D%0Aadvantage that the spiritual teacher pays more attention to his disciple,%0D%0Aand In turn the disciple takes special care in obeying his spiritual%0D%0Ateacher.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is said that you should have only one Murshid at a time, and that you%0D%0Ashould regard him as the most beneficial of all contemporary guides. This is%0D%0Abecause in such a situation, mutual relationship are enhanced (which is%0D%0Anecessary for reformatory progress). Putting your hand above the hand of the%0D%0Adisciple, or allowing the woman to hold the cloth behind the curtain when%0D%0Ashe is there, it is a tradition of religious divines, which is good and is%0D%0Aaccording to the customary method (Sunnah) of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam. It strengthens the covenant, which is made between the Murshid and%0D%0Ahis disciple. The covenant can also be made on both sides even without it.%0D%0AThis is why, a person who is far away, but desires to become a disciple of%0D%0Asome Murshid can be made to enter the fold of that spiritual teacher without%0D%0Aactually placing both the hands above one another. The Ahadith of Rasulullah%0D%0ASallallahu Alayhi Wasallam show that giving your hand in the hand of the%0D%0AMurshid is a good method. It is also proven from the Ahadith that Rasulullah%0D%0ASallallahu Alayhi Wasallam used to take the hand of his followers in his%0D%0Ahand whenever he took the Bay'at from them. Giving a cloth in the hand of a%0D%0Awoman is regarded as equivalent of giving one's hand. (Tasheel Qasdus-Sabeel%0D%0APg. 21).%0D%0A%0D%0AReally speaking, a man is composed of two things: one is the body, and the%0D%0Aother is the soul. There are ways and means of maintaining both of them in a%0D%0Ahealthy state. As material food is necessary for the maintenance of the%0D%0Abody, similarly, the soul requires spiritual sustenance, which is the%0D%0Aremembrance of Allah and perfect obedience to Him. As there are physical%0D%0Adiseases of the body, similarly, there are spiritual diseases, which are%0D%0Acalled internal diseases or the diseases of the heart, such as pride,%0D%0Avanity, conceit, hypocrisy, jealousy, hatred, love of wealth, love of fame%0D%0Aor glory. If medical treatment is not sought for the diseases of the body it%0D%0Aleads to physical death. Similarly, if the spiritual ailments are not cured%0D%0Athen the health of the heart and soul can be ruined. The death of the heart%0D%0Ais more dangerous than physical death. The Holy Qur'aan and the sayings of%0D%0ARasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam emphasize the maintenance and well%0D%0Abeing of the heart, and great warning has been given about the diseases of%0D%0Athe heart and its death. This is why Allah the Almighty says in Surah%0D%0AAl-Baqarah, Ayah 10:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"In their hearts is a disease and Allah increaseth their disease.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AIn Surah 22 Ayah 46, Allah, the Almighty says: \"For indeed it is not the%0D%0Aeyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts, which are within the bosoms that%0D%0Agrow blind.\"%0D%0A%0D%0A\"The day (when for your salvation) neither wealth will be of any use, nor%0D%0Achildren, but (that one will achieve salvation) who will bring before Allah,%0D%0Aa pure (perfect, sound and flawless) heart.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AIn one of the sayings of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam the following%0D%0Asupplication by him is quoted: \"O! Allah open the pores of my heart for your%0D%0Aremembrance.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another Hadith, these words of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam have%0D%0Abeen stated: \"Truly in the body there is a piece of flesh, when it is sound,%0D%0Athe whole body is sound, when it is diseased, the whole body is diseased.%0D%0ATruly it is the heart.\" (It was related by Al Bukhari and Muslim).%0D%0A%0D%0AThe main difference between physical diseases and the spiritual disease is%0D%0Athat physical diseases can be felt such as a fever, headache, stomach pain,%0D%0Aetc., but spiritual diseases go un-noticed. Therefore no attention is paid%0D%0Ato their treatment. For those diseases a spiritual physician called a%0D%0AMurshid or spiritual guide is required, so that he may diagnose the disease%0D%0Aand may suggest efficacious treatment. The Holy Qur'aan and Ahadith of%0D%0ARasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam are filled with the warnings of%0D%0Aspecific diseases of the heart, and their injurious effects. For example, a%0D%0Aman who has pride in his heart equal to a particle of a mustard seed, he%0D%0Awould never be able to get the fragrance of Paradise. Some times our actions%0D%0Aare not accepted because of hypocrisy, and hypocrisy has been called minor%0D%0Apolytheism. Regarding jealousy it has been said that jealousy destroys good%0D%0Adeeds in the same manner as fire destroys wood.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is said that those who are not forgiven, even in the Night of Acquittal%0D%0A(Shab-e-Barat 15th night of the month of Shaabaan), are those people who%0D%0Abear hatred in their heart. Similarly, other diseases have been mentioned.%0D%0AHence, it is necessary that a person should see a spiritual doctor for%0D%0Aeffective treatment.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe example of the Bay'at is as if someone has a chronic disease, or many%0D%0Adiseases, then postponing other worldly affairs, he would find out which%0D%0Adoctor or medical expert is most suitable for getting treatment. He would%0D%0Asearch out thoroughly. Finally when he would know that such and such a%0D%0Aspecialist is most suitable, he will go to him, and will promise to act on%0D%0Ahis medical instructions. The specialist would say: \"The treatment of your%0D%0Adisease would require a long time. You would have to take medicine according%0D%0Ato my prescription, and you would have to act on those precautions which I%0D%0Asuggest.\" The patient would promise to fulfill those conditions. The%0D%0Aspecialist would say: \"You have to come bi-monthly for a medical checkup.\"%0D%0AIf the patient accepts all these conditions, then it is a kind of Bay'at. If%0D%0Athe patient would act carefully on the advices of the specialist, then%0D%0Alnsha-Allah, Allah the Almighty will provide a cure.%0D%0A%0D%0ASimilarly. We have to consult a spiritual doctor for the spiritual diseases,%0D%0Aand we have to act upon his recommended prescription, and the precautions%0D%0Awhich he would ask to take (against unlawful, forbidden, or permitted%0D%0Athings) we would have to guard against them. And off and on we would have to%0D%0Asee the spiritual doctor to inform him about our condition. This is called%0D%0ABay'at \"Oath of Allegiance\" or becoming a disciple. If the patient suffering%0D%0Afrom the spiritual diseases (or the disciple) will act on his promise of%0D%0Afollowing the instructions of his spiritual doctor, then Allah, the Exalted,%0D%0Awill cure the diseases by divine grace and he would be included in the list%0D%0Aof popular, accepted and revered servants. As in physical diseases one has%0D%0Ato remain in the hospital, similarly, for the treatment of spiritual%0D%0Adiseases, a necessary element is to spend a considerable time in the company%0D%0Aof the Murshid.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis treatment has no fixed time. The more you pay due attention to the%0D%0Arules of honour and obedience to your spiritual guide, the quicker you will%0D%0Aachieve your aim. The more you are negligent in carrying out the%0D%0Ainstructions, the more it will be delayed. Most of the people think that%0D%0Abecoming a friend of Allah, and achieving close proximity to him is not so%0D%0Aeasy. This is an idea put into their mind by satan, who does not want them%0D%0Ato go on this path, although getting the treatment of the spiritual diseases%0D%0Ais necessary for every Muslim. Hence a thing, which is so incumbent, cannot%0D%0Abe regarded as something, which is impossible to achieve. In ancient times%0D%0Athe people were stalwart: they were asked to perform difficult spiritual%0D%0Aexercises and they used to reach their destination after hard labour. These%0D%0Adays mankind has become feeble, so Allah the Exalted has made this path%0D%0Aeasy.%0D%0A%0D%0ASufi Muhammad lqbal Muhajir Madani writes in his journal \"Achievements of%0D%0ALove\", \"Because our organs have become weak, our calibre of courage has%0D%0Awaned, the Day of Judgement is near, hence a little labour is accepted, and%0D%0Aeven if one strives a little without vigorous effort, he is regarded as%0D%0Asuccessful. It has been said about the last days of this world, that if one%0D%0Aacts upon one-tenth of what is required by Islam he is rewarded equal to the%0D%0Adeeds of 50 Sahaba (Radiallahu anhum) of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam. (Vide Mishkat- pg. 437). Similarly traversing the spiritual path%0D%0Atowards Allah has become easy today, just like going to the Ka'aba has%0D%0Abecome easy. In earlier times people had to travel on camel's back for%0D%0Amonths or for years to reach Makkah. At present, the distance of thousands%0D%0Aof miles in reaching Makkah has been reduced to that of a few hours. But the%0D%0Acondition is that a person should be capable of going on a Journey, should%0D%0Ahave a valid passport, a ticket and his vehicle Is fit for the passage and%0D%0Amust be moving towards the direction of Ka'aba. If any of these conditions%0D%0Ais not fulfilled, then even if a person makes his voice hoarse by crying%0D%0AMakkah, Makkah all the time to show his love of the House of Allah (Ka'aba)%0D%0Ahe can never reach there. Having this ease means, that in this path, no such%0D%0Awork will be taken which Is beyond the toleration quotient of a person. As%0D%0Athe ages of the people are becoming shorter, hence the period required to%0D%0Atraverse the spiritual path towards Allah has also been reduced. For%0D%0Aexample, instead of many years, only four months are required and regarded%0D%0Aas sufficient. Some times only 40 days or less than that are sufficient.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Need of a Spiritual Guide%0D%0AMaulana Ashraf All Thanvi Rahmatullah Alayh says that one needs a teacher%0D%0Aeven for learning how to perform outward religious requirements with their%0D%0Aaccompanying problems. Religious actions can go wrong without the direction%0D%0Aof a teacher. But there is a greater need for a teacher for acquiring the%0D%0Aknowledge of and acting upon spiritual and hearty actions some of which are%0D%0Acompulsory injunctions, some semi-compulsory ones. Technically the teacher%0D%0Aof these spiritual branches of knowledge is called MURSHID (spiritual%0D%0Aguide).%0D%0A%0D%0AUnderstanding your inner baser motives, and treating yourself of libidinal%0D%0Adisease is not possible without a Murshid. Hence, anyone, who steps on this%0D%0Apath, needs to search for a Murshid. When he has found him, then he should%0D%0Afollow his teachings and should act on his orders with full submission. He%0D%0Awould realize that even making repentance requires guidance of a spiritual%0D%0Ateacher; otherwise he would not know how to make repentance properly.%0D%0A(Tasheel Qasdus-Sabeel pg. 15)%0D%0A%0D%0AAdvantages of Bay'at%0D%0AShaikhul Islam Husain Ahmad Madni Rahmatullah Alayh says that Sayyid Ahmed%0D%0AShaheed states that when a person takes a Bay'at at the hands of a chosen%0D%0Aservant of Allah or saint then the honour and dignity which is accorded to%0D%0Ahim in the majestic Court of Allah the Exalted, supports the man who becomes%0D%0Ahis disciple, and Allah's blessings begin to shower on the disciple, and%0D%0Aguards him in one of the two ways.%0D%0A%0D%0A(1) If the spiritual guide has achieved a high station or rank in the eyes%0D%0Aof Allah the Exalted, then if the disciple of the spiritual guide is going%0D%0Ato fall in a pit of sinful activities, then Allah the Exalted informs the%0D%0Aspiritual teacher of the condition of his disciple, and the teacher is%0D%0Aordered to pull him out from the pit of degradation, then the teacher adopts%0D%0Aways and means to save his disciple from the situation.%0D%0A%0D%0ASome times, Allah the Almighty Himself saves that disciple from falling into%0D%0Athe abyss of sins, or either orders some angel or some spiritual, invisible%0D%0Aforce to guard the disciple from going astray, but these forces assume the%0D%0Ashape of disciple's spiritual guide. An example of this is the situation,%0D%0Awhich has confronted Prophet Yusuf Alayhis Salaam. Zulaikha tried to seduce%0D%0AYusuf Alayhis Salaam, closed all doors, and took him in a private room, to%0D%0Asatisfy her carnal desires. Yusuf Alayhis Salaam avoided her but she%0D%0Acontinued to insist and asked Yusuf Alayhis Salaam to comply with her%0D%0Awishes, so much so that there was a possibility of Yusuf Alayhis Salaam%0D%0Acommitting some mistake, at that juncture, Allah the Exalted appointed the%0D%0Aangel Jibraeel Alayhis Salaam to guard Yusuf Alayhis Salaam. Jibraeel%0D%0AAlayhis Salaam came to Yusuf Alayhis Salaam assuming the form of his father%0D%0AYaqoob Alayhis Salaam and standing before him, pressed his finger with his%0D%0Ateeth, and warned him not to make such a mistake. Actually, Yusuf Alayhis%0D%0ASalaam's father Yaqoob Alayhis Salaam, had no knowledge of it, but it%0D%0Aappeared so to Yusuf Alayhis Salaam, who was stopped and saved from a%0D%0Acritical crisis. This is why Sayyid Ahmed Shaheed says that some time when a%0D%0Adisciple of a spiritual guide is ready to fall towards a sinful path, then%0D%0AAllah the Almighty guards him by means of an angel or invisible forces.%0D%0A(Vide Shari status of Bay'at pg. 25). Numerous incidents of this type are%0D%0Astated in the books of Saints. For example, I relate an incident from%0D%0A\"Tazkeratur Rasheed\" Maulana Aashiq Elahi Rahmatullah Alayh writes:%0D%0A%0D%0AA man, Zakir Shaghil (devoted in remembrance of Allah) used to remain in the%0D%0Aservice of Maulana Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi Rahmatullah Alayh. His meals were%0D%0Ataken care of by a man who was a resident of Gangoh. He used to lead prayers%0D%0Ain a Mosque. We know full well that satan is always on the look out to%0D%0Aseduce a Muslim. That man fell in love with a woman and the mutual relation%0D%0Areached such a point that a time was fixed for meeting together. There was%0D%0Ano possibility of acquainting anyone with this satanic engagement. So no one%0D%0Aknew how the satan was ruining the character of that person. On the night of%0D%0Athe appointment with that lady, the man after Ishaa served his master%0D%0A(Maulana Gangohi Rahmatullah Alayh) and thinking that the master had fallen%0D%0Aasleep, he quietly walked out, the sky was quite clear, but after a few%0D%0Asteps, he found the sky was suddenly overcast with dark clouds. He went%0D%0Aahead and the clouds continued to move with him, till he reached the wall of%0D%0Athat house where the woman was standing according to her promise. Before he%0D%0Acould talk to her, there was such great thunder and lightning, that both of%0D%0Athem were terrified. That woman ran to her house thinking that if the family%0D%0Amembers of her house were awakened by the thunder, and did not find her%0D%0Athere, it would be very detrimental for her character. On the other hand,%0D%0Athe man ran back fast, knowing that the bed of his master was outside, and%0D%0Athat he slept near the bed and if his master was to call him, and would find%0D%0Ahim absent, his service will be at stake. So he ran as fast as he could to%0D%0Athe Khanqah, without fulfilling his desire of meeting the woman. When he%0D%0Aentered the Khanqah, the sky became quite clear. He went towards his master,%0D%0Apeeped and found that his spiritual master was sitting near the bed, head%0D%0Adowncast, hands resting on the bamboos of the bed in a position as if he was%0D%0Ain deep meditation like a spiritual Sheikh. He quietly reached his own bed,%0D%0Awhich was a little away from his master's bed under a tree. When he reached%0D%0Athere, then his master raised his head and lay down.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the morning, his spiritual master gave him advices indirectly, and%0D%0Adescribed the excellences of controlling one self from baser desires, which%0D%0Aare a test of a man's moral character. After hearing his master's advices,%0D%0Ahis heart was so much overwhelmed by shame and remorse, that he used to weep%0D%0Aover that incident when ever he recollected it, and used to repent whole%0D%0Aheartedly. After a few months, Allah the Exalted strengthened his spiritual%0D%0Arelation with his master, who invested him with the honour of making him his%0D%0Adeputy (Khalifa). Then he returned to his native place. (Vide:%0D%0ATazkeratur-Rasheed Vol.11 pg. 149)%0D%0A%0D%0AWarnings%0D%0AIncidents of this type have been written in connection with the Ahadith of%0D%0ARasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam and from the biographies of Rasulullah%0D%0ASallallahu Alayhi Wasallam's, Sahaba Radiallahu anhum, and other notable%0D%0Aspiritual leaders and guides. But such type of unusual occurrence and%0D%0Amiraculous performance is not necessary for every Murshid or spiritual guide%0D%0Aand for every disciple all the time. Some spiritual guides never display any%0D%0Amiraculous performance. But, the Bay'at at the hands of a Sheikh and his%0D%0Acompanionship is always fruitful to a greater or to a lesser degree. It is%0D%0Anot necessary for a Sheikh to show miracles. The thing, which is necessary%0D%0Afor a Sheikh, is following Islamic Canonical Law and valid practices of%0D%0ARasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam. Then he is a true spiritual leader,%0D%0Aeven if he does not show miracles. On the other hand, if a person does not%0D%0Afollow Islamic Canonical Law, and opposes the Sunnah of Rasulullah%0D%0ASallallahu Alayhi Wasallam even if he performs unusual or supernatural%0D%0Ajugglery, he is himself lost and is misleading others.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis is why Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi Rahmatullah Alayh writes:%0D%0A%0D%0A(1) When a true spiritual guide is available, and one tries to become his%0D%0Adisciple, he should first understand the object of discipleship, as people%0D%0Abecome disciples because of various personal ends.\"%0D%0A%0D%0A(2) Some want to discover things, which are not known to others. It has been%0D%0Aalready emphasized that it is not necessary for a Shaikh himself to show%0D%0Amiracles or to get the power of disclosure of unrevealed things, then how%0D%0Acan a disciple get such power.%0D%0A%0D%0A(3) Someone thinks that by becoming a disciple of a spiritual leader, his%0D%0AMurshid will be responsible for his forgiveness. And on the Day of%0D%0AJudgement, he would not go to hell inspite of all his sins. This is%0D%0Acompletely incorrect, Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam warned his%0D%0Adaughter Fatimah (Radiallahu anha) by saying: \"O! Fatimah save yourself from%0D%0Ahell fire (by doing virtuous actions).\"%0D%0A%0D%0A(4) Some think that one glance from a spiritual leader will change him%0D%0Aaltogether without any labour or struggle against bad tendencies. If this%0D%0Ahad been the case, then the sacrifices which the Sahaba Radiallahu anhum of%0D%0ARasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam made for upholding Islam would not%0D%0Ahave been necessary. No one can be more perfect than Rasulullah Sallallahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam, but Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam laboured hard to%0D%0Aestablish Islam. In exceptional cases, someone might have been changed by a%0D%0Amiraculous glance of a spiritual guide. But miracles do not occur all the%0D%0Atime, nor does every spiritual leader necessarily display miracles. It is a%0D%0Agreat mistake to become a disciple Just for this reason.%0D%0A%0D%0A(5) Someone says a discipleship should create a great fervour and%0D%0Aenthusiasm, uttering loud spiritual slogans. This will curb sinful%0D%0Atendencies, and will eliminate and minimize the desire to commit sin, and%0D%0Adoing good deeds may become involuntary acts. The heart would then be free%0D%0Afrom all bad thoughts and we would be immersed in a%0D%0Aspiritual-unconsciousness. Outwardly this idea looks better than others, but%0D%0Athis is based on ignorance. Such conditions are Sufistic spiritual stages,%0D%0Awhich are not under the control of a human being. Such thoughts and states%0D%0Aare no doubt good, but they are not the be-all and the end-all. The real%0D%0Aobject is to achieve something, which is under your control. On thinking%0D%0Aseriously you would realize that such desires are a hidden deceit of your%0D%0Aego. Your ego loves rest, comfort and renown. These conditions are based on%0D%0Athese things. A person who is dedicated to please Allah, he has nothing to%0D%0Ado with such desires. His condition will show that he is saying: \"Separation%0D%0Aor union is not important, the main thing is to earn the pleasure of the%0D%0Abeloved, because one cuts a sorry figure by asking his beloved to fulfill a%0D%0Adesire which is not according to the pleasure of the beloved.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AIn other words, separation and union are only the phases; the main thing is%0D%0Ato earn the pleasure of the beloved. Asking the Almighty for a thing which%0D%0Ais other than Allah is regrettable:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"Passing of the days is of no value. The remembrance of Allah should remain%0D%0Awith us, because there is none other Holier that Allah.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AIn other words, there is of no importance if different spiritual states come%0D%0Aand go. Our relation with Allah should be strengthened because nothing is%0D%0AHolier than Allah:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"O! My heart you are still under delusion if you differentiate between good%0D%0Aluck and misfortune. In other wo"
