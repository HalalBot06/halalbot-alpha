  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalm-wa-alikum mufti sahab. I tend to be a heavy sleeper, especally when i fall asleep late. So i am usally late for alot of things, espeaclly fajr salat, and i've bought severly alarm clocks, but none of them do the job. So i was wondering if there is a dua i can use to help me wake up at a desired time. I while back i thought i heard of a dua similar to this. Do you know of any dua like this?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFor a person to wake up early in order to make his/her Fajr Salaat, that\nperson needs to get to bed early and most importantly to read the Masnoon Du\n'aas that our beloved Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) should read, i.e.\nthe three Quls, Aayaatul Kursi, the last two Aayaats of Surah Baqarah, and\nthen make intention to get up for Fajr. Also, you need to keep the alarm\nclock away from you so when it rings you must get out of bed to put if off.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
