  "question": "A very confusing ruling about mensesâ€¦..",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti, I would greatly appreciate it if you would tell me the ruling about the following situation: a woman has a normal menstrual cycle of 7 days each month. She usually starts on the 24th of every month. However what happens is that in September she starts on the 24th but she doesn?t stop after 7 days and her bleeding continues for approx two and a half months. What I mean is that the bleeding continues from the 24th of September to the 13th of December. For 7 days she sees absolutely nothing (from the 14th to the 20th). Bleeding resumes on the 21st and ceases after 7 days, similar to her previous habit. After this her period returns in January on the 21st for 7 days as usual. So, firstly, what should she do in the first instance when her bleeding exceeded 10 days and continued? And secondly, are the 7 days of bleeding after the break counted as her period or Istihaadha? Generally, what should this woman do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe woman in reference should follow her previous cycle of 7 days Haydh from\nthe 24 till the 30 of each month in September, October and November.\n\nThe remaining days of bleeding will be Istihaadha. The includes 1 - 13\nDecember. He new cycle of Haydh will be for seven days from the 21st of the\nmonth, in December and January.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
