  "question": "Is trimming the beard below the fist level Makruh Tahrimi? Is this regarded as being a divorce? Did bibi Aisha play with dolls that had faces on them?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)You've said in ur previous answers that trimming the beard below the fist level is 'Makruh Tahrimi', does this mean that if I go ahead with this act I will be commiting minimal sin because it is near haram, but not actually haram. What about if I continue doing this act. 2)My mother received her divorce papers a couple of months ago, but my father sent three documents, it said \"first divorce\"-1st notice, \"first divorce\"-second notice, \"first divorce-third notice. My mother is a bit confused on whether if she has actually recived her divorce or not because on each divorce it says \"first divorce\", my mother thinks that he might be playing games. 3) One of the Imams here says that kids are allowed to play with dolls, and further he mentions that there are hadiths that back this conclusion, he says that bibi Aisha had played with dolls that had faces on them.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The term 'Makrooh Tahrimi' is a technical term only. It still basically\nmeans prohibited.\n2. It is still considered as one divorce - the subsequent notices were a\nform of 'emphasis' on the preceding notices. Hence, only one applies.\n3. Yes, Hadhrat Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha) played with dolls but not of the\ntype we have today. Her dolls were made out of rags without any prominent\nfeatures. The dolls of today have prominent features. Today's dolls fall\nunder the category of 'picture making' which is vehemently prohibited by the\nAhaadith.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
