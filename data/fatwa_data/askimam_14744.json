  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am planning to go for hajj this year inshallah. The company who has arranged our trip will first take me to mecca for umrah. I will stay in mecca for 5 days then they  will take me to madinah for 7 days and from madinah they will take me directly to mina for the hajj. I will put my ahram in madinah for hajj . Is it OK to go directly to mina from madinah.  What should be my intention for hajj before leaving i.e tamattu or qiran or ifrad. If tamattu can I leave mecca to go to madinah and then directly go to mina for hajj.  Should I shorten my pray  during 5 days of  hajj or pray full salah.\n\nIn Arafat should I combine zahur and asr salah or pray them on their proper time.\nWhat about sunnat prayer and witr prayer. Should I read them during 5 days of hajj.\nIn Mudallafah, do I need to pray witr after praying magrib and esha together.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n According to your schedule as explained, you will be Musafir and will have to make Qasr of all the 4 rakaats Fardh Salaah if you perform Salaah by yourself. If you perform salaah behind the Imam, you will follow the Imam. According to the Hanafi Madhab, if a Haaji is performing Zohr and Asr Salaah in his tent and not in the Musjid e Namira, then each Salaah must be performed separately in its time. The Asr Salaah will not be performed with the Zohr Salaah. A Musafir does not have to perform the Sunnat e Muakkadah Salaah. However, it is advisable to perform the Sunnat e Muakkadah Salaah especially when one is in such a sacred journey as Hajj.\n\n \n\nWitr Salaah is wajib and has to be performed at all times.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\nThe guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\nEducation and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\nIslam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\nWhen one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\nMuslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\nWe have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\nIf you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\nIf that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\nRasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit”.\n\n \n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
