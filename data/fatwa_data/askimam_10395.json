Kindly refer below our standard reply on similar queries - contraception%0D%0A%0D%0A2. You should not interfere with your normal monthly cycle by taking tablets. However, if there is a need and there is no alternative, for example, you will be experiencing your monthly periods and you still have to perform your Tawaaf-e-Ziyaarah (Fardh Tawaaf) while you are also scheduled to return home immediately. If you fear such a predicament, then there is a leeway to control your monthly cycle during Hajj.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Salaat (Durood) and salaam may be conveyed to Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] at any time. It is not restricted to the time of visiting the Mubaarak grave of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] %0D%0A%0D%0A4. According to the Hanafi Madhab, a follower of the Imaam (Muqtadi) must remain silent in the standing posture. He cannot recite even Surah Faatiha. Rasulullah [sallallahu alayhi wasallam] said, 'That person who has an Imaam, the Qiraat (recitation) of the Imaam is his (followers) Qiraat.' The Hadith on reciting Surah al-Faatiha is for the Imaam or a person performing Salaat by himself. The Hanafi Madhab is not confined by Deobandis. They are all around the world.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
