  "question": "When we pray sunnat or nafil salat we know it may be better to read long surahs. But for me in the longer surahs there is more chances of making mistakes.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nFor example I pray two nafil with small surahs like Surah Naas and Surah Falaq without any mistakes. But if I pray two nafil with Surah Rahman and Surah Waqia I feel I may be making some mistakes. Is my prayer with longer surahs with few mistakes in tilawat better then prayer with smaller surahs.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nYour Nafl Salaat with longer Surahs and making mistakes is more virtuous\nthan reciting shorter Surahs.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
