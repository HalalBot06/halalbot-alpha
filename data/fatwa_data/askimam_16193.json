(\n\n“Seeking (marriage) by means of your wealth to all other women excluding these (women) has been permitted for you in chastity (of marriage), not merely for lust. So, to those of them whose company you have enjoyed, give their dues (Mehr) as obligated...” (4:24)\n\nAs Muslims, our duty is to accept the decree and command of Allah regardless of whether we understand its wisdom or not. In Islam, a Muslim places obedience to Allah Ta’ala before his / her logic and understanding as opposed to other religions which place logic before obedience. Thus, the main reason why a woman receives Mehr is in the absolute obedience of Allah Ta’ala’s command as is clear from the above quoted reference.  \n\n2.      Mehr is a stipulated amount of money or wealth given by the bridegroom or a person on his behalf to the bride due to the occurrence of a Nikah. The Mehr is the sole right of the wife and she is at liberty to use this money or wealth as she deems fit whenever and wherever she so desires. It is not necessary to save the money or to delay payment of the Mehr until the time of divorce or Iddat.\n\n3.      There is no zakat payable upon the wealth of minors. (Bada’i al-Sana’I, vol.2 pg. 79, Dar al-Kutub Deoband)\n\n4.      Qurbani is not compulsory upon a minor. (Radd al-Muhtar, vol. 6 pg. 315, H. M. Saeed / Fatawa Rahimiya, vol. 10 pg. 25, Dar al-Isha’at) \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Yusuf bin Yaqub,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
