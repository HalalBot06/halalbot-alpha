  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe event of Ghadeer Khum in Quran, Sunnah & History%0D%0A%0D%0AAs you know that the Shi`a say that Ali (rah) is the one who should have%0D%0Abeen the first khalifa and not Abu Bakr (rah) (or Umar (rah) or Uthman%0D%0A(rah)). They bring some evidences from the Sunni books (Bukhari, Muslim,..)%0D%0Aand one of them is the hadeeth of Ghadeer Khumm.%0D%0A%0D%0ABefore we start, we should Say that Ali (rah) is the husband of the daughter%0D%0Aof the prophet (peace be upon him), Fatima (rah, the best woman of the%0D%0Apeople of the Jannah), he is the cousin of the prophet (peace be upon him),%0D%0Aand he is the fourth of the rightly-guided khalifahs and his qualities are%0D%0Aall well known to us.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, we are not talking about the qualities of Ali (rah), because we all%0D%0Aknow it. We are discussing whether or not the hadeeth of Ghadeer Khumm is%0D%0Aevidence that Ali should have been the first khalifa.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe start by reading the hadeeth from Sahih Muslim Book 031, Number 5920:%0D%0AYazid b. Hayyan reported, I went along with Husain b. Sabra and 'Umar b.%0D%0AMuslim to Zaid b. Arqam and, as we sat by his side, Husain said to him:%0D%0AZaid. you have been able to acquire a great virtue that you saw Allah's%0D%0AMessenger (may peace be upon him) listened to his talk, fought by his side%0D%0Ain (different) battles, offered prayer behind me. Zaid, you have in fact%0D%0Aearned a great virtue. Zaid, narrate to us what you heard from Allah's%0D%0AMessenger (may peace be upon him). He said: I have grown old and have almost%0D%0Aspent my age and I have forgotten some of the things which I remembered in%0D%0Aconnection with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), so accept%0D%0Awhatever I narrate to you, and which I do not narrate do not compel me to do%0D%0Athat. He then said: One day Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood%0D%0Aup to deliver sermon at a watering place known as Khumm situated between%0D%0AMecca and Medina. He praised Allah, extolled Him and delivered the sermon%0D%0Aand. exhorted (us) and said: Now to our purpose. O people, I am a human%0D%0Abeing. I am about to receive a messenger (the angel of death) from my Lord%0D%0Aand I, in response to Allah's call, (would bid good-bye to you), but I am%0D%0Aleaving among you two weighty things: the one being the Book of Allah in%0D%0Awhich there is right guidance and light, so hold fast to the Book of Allah%0D%0Aand adhere to it. He exhorted (us) (to hold fast) to the Book of Allah and%0D%0Athen said: The second are the members of my household I remind you (of your%0D%0Aduties) to the members of my family. He (Husain) said to Zaid: Who are the%0D%0Amembers of his household? Aren't his wives the members of his family?%0D%0AThereupon he said: His wives are the members of his family (but here) the%0D%0Amembers of his family are those for whom acceptance of Zakat is forbidden.%0D%0AAnd he said: Who are they? Thereupon he said: 'Ali and the offspring of%0D%0A'Ali, 'Aqil and the offspring of 'Aqil and the offspring of Ja'far and the%0D%0Aoffspring of 'Abbas. Husain said: These are those for whom the acceptance of%0D%0AZakat is forbidden. Zaid said: Yes.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis hadeeth is also narrated in other books: Tirmithi, Ahmed, an-nasai,%0D%0Aal-hakem and others. Almost all the links are for pages in Arabic. I will%0D%0Atranslate the important points inshaAllah as I go along.%0D%0A%0D%0AMosnad of Ahmed:%0D%0AIbn Namir told us that Abd Al-Malik (Ibn Abi-Sulayman) told us according to%0D%0AAttia Al-`ufi who said: I asked Zayd Ibn Arqam and I told him that some%0D%0Apeople told me a hadeeth according to you about Ali (rah) in the day of%0D%0AGhadeer Khumm and I want to hear it from you. So Zayd said: You people of%0D%0AIraq, you have what you have. I told him: Do not worry about me. He said:%0D%0AYes we were in Al-Juhfa and the prophet(peace be upon him) came to us%0D%0Aholding the hands of Ali (rah) and said: O people don't you know that I am%0D%0Awith the believers from their selves. They said: Yes. He said: kuntu mawlaah fa Ali mawlaah%3E. [Attia] said: Did he say: man waalah wa `ad man `adaah%3E (O Allah: Befriend whosoever befriends him and%0D%0Abe the enemy of whosoever is hostile to him). [Zayd] said: I told you as I%0D%0Aheard it.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe saying \"man kuntu mawlah fa Ali mawlah\" is correct and strong.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe addition , \"O Allah:%0D%0ABefriend whosoever befriends him and be the enemy of whosoever is hostile to%0D%0Ahim\" is also correct, albeit weaker.%0D%0AHowever, the scholars of hadeeth classify any extra additions as %0D%0Aand hence we will not talk about. We will only talk about the authentic%0D%0Aversions shown above.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis hadeeth is used to prove that Ali is the khalifa. The Shia says that%0D%0A\"mawla\" means \"wali\" (leader) and hence this incident means that the prophet%0D%0Ais telling the Muslims that Ali is the next khalifa.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis is their point regarding this hadeeth. The difference, then, is the%0D%0Ameaning of \"man kuntu mawlah, fa Ali mawlah\". The shi`ah says that it means%0D%0A\"man kuntu waleeh, fa Ali waleeh\". The Sunnah says that it means love and%0D%0Aclose relation. Muwalat is the opposite of Mu`adat. The proof comes from the%0D%0Afirst addition: \"oh Allah waali man walaah wa `adi man `adaah\". (O Allah%0D%0Abefriend whosover befriends him and be the enemy of whosoever is hostile to%0D%0Ahim). So we are talking about muwalah and mu`adat (love and enmity). It is%0D%0Aabout the love of the people to Ali (rah).%0D%0A%0D%0ABefore we talk about that, let us talk about why the prophet said so. The%0D%0AShi`ah claim that the prophet ( peace be upon him ) stopped people in this%0D%0Aplace in the hot weather and they say that their number was more than 100%0D%0Athousand and that this was the place where all the people of Hajj were%0D%0Agathered and the main reason is that the prophet ( peace be upon him )%0D%0Awanted to tell the people \"man kuntu mawlah fa Ali mawlah\" in addition to%0D%0Atheir additions.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe reason for this hadeeth is as follows:%0D%0ARead this hadeeth from Bukhari volume 5, Book 59 Number 637:%0D%0ANarrated Buraida: The Prophet sent 'Ali to Khalid to bring the Khumus (of%0D%0Athe booty) and I hated Ali, and 'Ali had taken a bath (after a sexual act%0D%0Awith a slave-girl from the Khumus). I said to Khalid, \"Don't you see this%0D%0A(i.e. Ali)?\" When we reached the Prophet I mentioned that to him. He said,%0D%0A\"O Buraida! Do you hate Ali?\" I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Do you hate him, for%0D%0Ahe deserves more than that from the Khumlus.\"%0D%0AIn other narrations (al-tirmithi and ahmed), in addition to the above, the%0D%0Aprophet said: \"O buraida man kuntu mawlah fa Ali mawlah\"%0D%0ASo Ali took one of the slaves named Waseefa as his slave and then after%0D%0Ahaving sexual act with her, he was taking a bath. Buraida (rah) became%0D%0Aangry. He thought why would Ali take one of the slaves for himself. So he%0D%0Amentioned this to the prophet(peace be upon him).%0D%0AAl-bayhaqi narrates from Abu sa'eed that Ali prevented them from riding the%0D%0Acamels of the sadaqa that they acquired. He then made a person to be their%0D%0Aleader and went to the prophet(peace be upon him). When Ali came back, he%0D%0Afound that their leader gave them permission to ride the camels. When Ali%0D%0Asaw that, he became angry and he blamed the leader. (In another narration,%0D%0Ait mentions that they were new clothes that Ali prevented them from wearing%0D%0Abut they wear them despite his orders). Abu sa'eed said that when we went%0D%0Aback to madina, we mentioned to the prophet the harshness that we have seen%0D%0Afrom Ali. The prophet said: Stop O saad ibn Malik: O By Allah I have known%0D%0Athat he is done good for the sake of Allah. (Ibn Katheer says that this%0D%0Ahadeeth is on the conditions of Al-Nasaie)%0D%0AIbn Katheer said that the people in the army started to talk about Ali (rah)%0D%0Abecause he prevented them from riding the camels and took back the new%0D%0Aclothes that they acquired. Because of that, after the prophet ( peace be%0D%0Aupon him ) was done with the Hajj and while returning back to Madina, he%0D%0Astopped to explain to the people how some of the qualities of Ali and stress%0D%0Athe closeness of Ali to him and the importance of loving Ali. He did so to%0D%0Aremove what was in many of the hearts of some of the people against Ali.%0D%0AThat's why the prophet ( peace be upon him ) delayed talking about this%0D%0Atopic until they were close to Madina and he didn't talk about it in Makkah%0D%0Aduring the Hajj. On the day of Arafa, the prophet ( peace be upon him )%0D%0Aspoke to the people and and he never mentioned this topic at all. After he%0D%0Afinished his sermon, he said \"Did I convey the message\" and the people said%0D%0A\"Yes\" then he said \"O Allah be my witness\".%0D%0AWhy did he delay the topic till after Hajj? Because this topic is only of%0D%0Aconcern to the people of Madina because those who talked about Ali were from%0D%0AMadina as they were the ones who went with Ali to the battle. He talked%0D%0Aabout it in a place called ghadeer khumm in a place called Ju'fa, which is%0D%0Aabout 250 km from Makkah.%0D%0A(See map:%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AA simple look at the map is enough to refute the shi`ah claim that this is%0D%0Athe gathering place of the the Hajeej. People gather for Hajj at Makkah and%0D%0Aleave the Hajj at Makkah. The Hajeej don't leave from a place 250 km from%0D%0AMakkah. After Hajj, the people of Makkah stay at Makkah. The people of%0D%0AAl-Taif go to Al-Taif. The people of Yemen go to Yemen. The people of%0D%0Aal-kufa go to al-kufa and so on. All the tribes go back to their homes. The%0D%0Apeople that went with the prophet(peace be upon him) were the people of%0D%0AMadinah and those who are using the road of Madina to go to their dwellings.%0D%0AThese are the ones that the prophet( peace be upon him ) talked to when he%0D%0Asaid: \"man ..\".%0D%0AAlso the speech was not only about Ali despite the fact that Ali deserves%0D%0Athe speech and more (may Allah be pleased with him). But in the speech, the%0D%0Aprophet ( peace be upon him ) reminded the people with the Quran and its%0D%0Aimportance. He also reminded the people of the love of his household (may%0D%0AAllah be pleased with them) and then he mentioned Ali (rah). So there were%0D%0Amore than one topic that the prophet ( peace be upon him ) talked about.%0D%0AThe meaning of ( Mawla )%0D%0AIbn Al-Atheer says that the word (mawal) in the Arabic language could only%0D%0Amean:%0D%0Arabb = Lord%0D%0Amalik = owner%0D%0Amun`im = benefactor%0D%0Amu'tiq = liberator%0D%0Anaser = helper%0D%0Amuheb = lover%0D%0Ahaleef = ally%0D%0Aaabd = slave (for example: Zaid ibn haretha was the mawla of the prophet (%0D%0Apeace be upon him ))%0D%0Asihr = brother-in-law%0D%0Aibn al `am = cousin%0D%0AThe arabs would use the word mawlah to mean all of the above. But what did%0D%0Athe prophet ( peace be upon him ) mean by his word?%0D%0AFirst the hadeeth has no evidences for the imamah (leadership) because if%0D%0Athe prophet ( peace be upon him ) wanted to mean khilafah or imamah, he%0D%0Awouldn't have used a word that can have all these meanings. He would have%0D%0Asaid something like: Ali is your khalifa (or imam) after me, or when I die,%0D%0Alisten and obey to Ali ibn Abi Talib. But the prophet didn't use any of%0D%0Athese clear words. He said: \"man kuntu ...\".%0D%0AImam Shafi'i says that this is the walaa of Al-islam because Allah(swt) says%0D%0Ain the Quran (Surat Muhammad,verse 11:%0D%0AThat is because Allah is the Protector (mawala) of those who believe, and%0D%0Abecause the unbelievers shall have no protector for them (47:11)%0D%0AIn the Quran (Surat Al-hadid (The Iron), verse 15), Allah (swt) says:%0D%0ASo today ransom shall not be accepted from you nor from those who%0D%0Adisbelieved; your abode is the fire; it is your friend (mawlakum) and evil%0D%0Ais the resort.%0D%0AHe called the hell fire \"mawla\" for the extreme closeness to it by the%0D%0Akuffar.%0D%0ANote also that the word mawlah is different than the word waly.%0D%0AThe waly comes from walayah which is the leadership. Whereas mawlah comes%0D%0Afrom wilayah which is love and nusrah (help and aid).%0D%0AAllah (swt) says in the Quran (Surat At-tahrim ,verse 4):%0D%0AThen surely Allah it is Who is his Guardian (mawlah), and Jibreel and -the%0D%0Abelievers that do good, and the angels after that are the aiders.%0D%0AIt means love, nusrah and help.%0D%0AThe prophet ( peace be upon him ) used the word mawla not only to describe%0D%0AAli but to others as well. The following hadeeth is narrated in Bukhari%0D%0AVolume 4, Book 56, Number 715 & and others.%0D%0ANarrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, \"The tribes of Quraish, Al-Ansar,%0D%0AJuhaina, Muzaina, Aslam, Ghifar and Ashja' are my helpers (mawaalii),, and%0D%0Athey have no protector (i.e. Master) except Allah and His Apostle.\"%0D%0AThere are other examples as well but I think that the above is sufficient to%0D%0Amake the point.%0D%0AIt is also important to point out that the prophet ( peace be upon him ) did%0D%0Anot say \"after me\" (in any authentic narration). He only said \"man kuntu%0D%0Amawlah fa Ali mawlah\" without giving any time frame. This means that this%0D%0Afact is timeless. If the prophet ( peace be upon him ) had meant \"whoever%0D%0Aamong you is under my leadership, he is also under the leadership of Ali\",%0D%0Awhich is the meaning that the Shi`a understands, if the prophet had meant it%0D%0Aas such, then there would be a big problem. Two leadership for the Muslim%0D%0Aummah at the time of the prophet ( peace be upon him ) does not make a lot%0D%0Aof sense.%0D%0AOf course, the prophet did not mean it that way and also the companions at%0D%0Athat time did not understand it that way, otherwise there would be a great%0D%0Afitnah. However, it is possible to have more than one mawla at the same%0D%0Atime - to love, help and aid the prophet and to love help and aid Ali (rah).%0D%0AI hope that the above is simple and clear. If, however, you have any%0D%0Aparticular doubts or confusions, please let me know and inshaAllah I can%0D%0Adelve more into it. The Sunni view is that the hadeeth of ghadir khum has%0D%0Anothing to do with who the leader is after the prophet(peace be upon him).%0D%0AIt means, however, that Ali is loved by the prophet (peace be upon him) and%0D%0Athat we should love him and give nusrah to him. May Allah (swt) join us with%0D%0AAli and the rest of the companions (may Allah be pleased with them all) on%0D%0Athe pool to drink from the honorable hands of the prophet ( peace be upon%0D%0Ahim )."
