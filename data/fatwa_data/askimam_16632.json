  "question": "Is it permssible to become a bone marrow donor?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\njust like how shariat has permitted the donation of blood under circumstances and the donation must not harm the donor in anyway similarly does shariat allow the following:\n\na) becoming a bone marrow donor?\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nHaving researched the matter, we have learned that there are alternatives to bone marrow donation from donors. There are new medical techniques available that use either the very same patient's marrow or his blood to assist in the production of new marrow. With this new procedure, there seems to be no need to use the marrow of another person. Therefore, it will not be permissible to donate one's bone marrow to another patient. However, if it is not possible or it will cause harm to the individual if he uses his own blood or marrow and a reliable experienced doctor advises that another person's blood be used for the same procedure, then it will be permissible to use the donated blood for the procedure.\n\n(Fatāwā Mahmūdiyah, vol. 18, pg. 328, Farūqiyah)\n(Fatāwā Rahīmiyah, vol. 10, pg. 175, Dar al-Ishat)\n\n\"Autologous HSCT involves isolation of haematopoietic stems cells (HSC) from the patient and storage of the harvested cells in a freezer. The patient is then treated with high-dose chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy in the form of total body irradiation to eradicate the patient's malignant cell population at the cost of also eliminating the patient's bone marrow stem cells, then return of the patient's own stored stem cells to their body. Autologous transplants have the advantage of a lower risk of graft rejection and infection, since the recovery of immune function is rapid. Also, the incidence of a patient experiencing graft-versus-host disease is close to none as the donor and recipient are the same individual. However, in malignant disease the likelihood of cancer relapse and related mortality is high relative to allogeneic HCST[9].\" (Wikipedia. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. [Online] April 23, 2008 < http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow_transplant >)\n\nWith the various medical procedures available, there seems to be absolutely no need for the marrow of another individual. Should the need still arise for the marrow, the involved person can forward a separate question including the details of his or her case and a separate ruling will be issued based on the individual facts. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
