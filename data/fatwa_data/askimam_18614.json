You have preceded us, and we will join you.”\n\n \n\nThe reason why we use second person pronoun is that according to the hadith, the people in the grave can actually hear the person saying salaam to them. And they even reply back. However, the living cannot hear them.\n\n \n\n(Mirqatul Mafatih vol. 4 pg. 255-256, Maktaba Rasheediya)\n\n \n\nTherefore, how can one use this to substantiate believing that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is haazir and naazir i.e. omnipresent and omniscient?\n\n \n\nThe Barelwis, when they say ‘Ya Rasulallah’, say it believing that Rasulullah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is haazir and naazir. It is this belief that is against the teachings of Islam, because according to Islamic teachings, only Allah Ta’ala has total and perfect knowledge of everything.\n\n \n\nIn other words, when the Barelwis say ‘Ya Rasulullah’, they say it with a corrupt and non-Islamic belief. However, when we say ‘Ya Ahlal Quboor’ we do not say it with any corrupt and non-Islamic belief. Therefore, how can one use the later to justify the former?\n\n \n\n \n\n2) May Allah Ta’ala accept your pious intentions and may He make you a pious and righteous Alim of deen.
