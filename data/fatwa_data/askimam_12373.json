  "question": "Muslim brothers feel and show that women are nothing and men are allowed to do everything they can. I feel that is not right",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n. I am a male, unmarried and in our Pakistani society in Great Britain a lot of Pakistani and probably other Muslim brothers feel and show that women are nothing and men are allowed to do everything they can. I feel that is not right. The wife should be given the exact rights as so should the man as both are equal. However men always present this hadith, to the nearest meaning saying that our prophet peace be upon him said if a woman had to obey any one else besides Allah azo wa jal she would bow down to him. Could you please explain this so I can personally tell these backward people the true meaning? Secondly another question is of after reading the book (summary of the differences in the ummah) by Molana Yusuf ludyanvi rahimullah tala alahi I wanted to find out more differences between the Ahle sunnat wal Jammat and the Shia. What book would you suggest? Jazakamullah Khair - Wassalaam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala has created us all and has given some distinction over others%0D%0Awhile He has made some subordinate to others. This does not mean that they%0D%0Aare not equal, as they are all human beings. Similarly, Allah Ta'ala has%0D%0Amade some of us males and others females. All are the creation of Allah and%0D%0Aall have to obey Allah. Allah has given each of them rights over the other%0D%0Aand we will be questioned about these rights. Allah Ta'ala has placed the%0D%0Aaffairs of women in the hands of men and has ordered women to obey men.%0D%0AWomen being subordinate to men does not mean that they are \"nothing\". A%0D%0Afather is a human, just as is the child, yet the child is subordinate to the%0D%0Afather, on account of the fact that Allah has made him the Father and has%0D%0Agiven him distinction. A worker is human as is his boss, yet the worker is%0D%0Asubordinate to him.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala has in His Infinite Wisdom, given men distinction over women in%0D%0Amany aspects. Instead of trying to equal themselves to men, women should%0D%0Arather focus their attention on pleasing Allah and their husbands. What the%0D%0Ahadith means is that women are completely subordinate to men, however this%0D%0Adoesn't mean that they are worthless, neither does it men that they have no%0D%0Arights. Those who usurp and trample the rights of women, should remember%0D%0Athat they will have to answer to Allah for this!%0D%0A%0D%0AThe following are some authentic books about the shia published by Madrasah%0D%0AArabia Islamia, Azaadville:%0D%0AAmir mu`awiyah%0D%0AThe rank of the Sahabah%0D%0AAbubakr and the shias%0D%0AKhomeni and the Iranian revolution%0D%0AHadhrat Muawiyah (R.A)%0D%0AShia beliefs%0D%0AThe Status of Sayyidina Abubakr (R.A)%0D%0AThe twelfth Shia Imam%0D%0A%0D%0AThese books could be purchased online from www.786bookshop.com. The madrasah%0D%0Awebsite www.alinaam.org.za also contains many articles on the topic.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMl.
