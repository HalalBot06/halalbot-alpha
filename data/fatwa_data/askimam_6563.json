  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamAlaikum. I hired an employee and gave him detailed instructions on how to run my business. He was careless and accepted over $1000 worth of bad checks from a customer b/c he didn't follow procedure of calling bank to verify if funds were available. Also, he did not regularly open and close the store at the proper times, which resulted in lost business as well as angry customers. Due to his negligence, another customer stole merchandise because he left the display case open which he should not have. I have already paid him part of his salary. His remaining salary is $440. Since because of him my business lost over $1000 due to the bad checks, and actually more than that if you consider the stolen merchandise and lost business- AM I REQUIRED BY THE SHARIAH TO PAY HIM HIS REMAINING $440 SALARY?
