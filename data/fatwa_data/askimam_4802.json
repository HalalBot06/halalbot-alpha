  "question": "What is the basis of the following theory that all the other Ambiya a.s. asked Allah S.W.T., for the position of Muhammad s.a.w.s. (pls see details):",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDuring a bayaan, one Mufti Saab here mentioned that the position of Rasoolullah s.a.w.s. was desired by all the other Prophets, and only the Du?aa of Eesa a.s. was accepted, and he will come as the Ummati of Rasoolullah s.a.w.s. on behalf of all the other prophets.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYou probably misunderstood the Mufti Saheb. The fact is that Ummatis of\nMuhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) have such a high status in the eyes\nof Allah Ta'ala that a number of prophets of the past desired to be Ummatis\nof Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nOnly Eesa's (Alayhis salaam) Du'aa was accepted and he will return as an\nUmmati before the advent of Qiyaamat.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
