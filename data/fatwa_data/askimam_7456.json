  "answer": "QUESTION\nis there any prayer for this to help me? I love my husband so much, and I can?t imagine my life without him. Lately I have this feelings continuously that something bad is going to happen to him and I will lose him, and every dream I have and word I hear I interpreted in a very pessimistic way. This starts to annoy me and starts to affect my performance in my work, life and everything. I believe in God and I know that life and death is completely in God hand (ela3mar beyad allah ) but is there anything or any prayer I can do to make me function normally and not to be scared to loose my husband every second.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMay Allah bless your close relationship with your husband, Aameen.\n\nThe pessimism about your husband is from the Shaytaan. He wishes to create an imbalance in you. You should recite, ?Laa hawla walaa quwwata illaa billaah? and ignore such negative feelings. Be optimistic and place your trust in Allah. Insha Allah, you will feel safe and secured.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
