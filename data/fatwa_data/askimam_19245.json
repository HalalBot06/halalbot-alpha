  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy husband is loving and caring, but when it comes to the topic of salah he intentionally neglects it. And if I keep on advising him on salah and remind him he get angry about it.\n\nHe feels that I am trying to control him and tells that ho knows all those thing and am not needed to tell it again and again. I am keeping on asking dua to make him a good Muslim, who is regular in his prayers. But I feel bit scared of keeping on advising him on prayers because at the end it turn it to an argument. Same issue comes when it comes to music. And he is so addicted to it. Can u please advise me how to bring him in to the track of prayer and please do ask dua to make love in his heart on salah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nJazakillah for writing to us requesting some help. Please do forgive me for the delay in responding to your query.\n\nSister, you have been correct in trying to help your husband to make his connection with the deen of Allah Ta’ala. I empathise with you in this situation as it must be painful and difficult for you to remain silent when your husband does not turn to His Creator in gratitude. Since you say that he becomes angry, have you thought of other ways in which to encourage him to set himself free from the trap of shaitaan?\n\nI am sure you realise that he is very much a victim of his own nafs and under shaitaan’s control. As a wife, you feel it is our duty to help him to change. Allow me to make a few suggestions. If you have a receiver, turn on the adhaan so that he hears it every time he is at home. (At the same time, don’t tell him anything.)\n\nYou could perhaps start playing Surah Yaseen early in the morning after fajr salaah so that he can hear it. Make a point of turning on (a  C.D.) “Para a day” from the Quran in his presence. Insha’Allah, listening to the Quran may soften his heart.\n\nChannel Islam and Radio Islam are beamed all over the world via satellite radio and via audio streaming from South Africa. Hundreds of people from all over the world write in to say how their lives have changed through listening to these radio stations. Insha’Allah, it will have the same effect on him in time. Make a point of collecting literature on Islam , salaah, love of Allah Ta’ala and even from revert Muslims and leave it at strategic places in the house so that he reads it. Make a point of remaining silent and do not make any comments or suggestions even if he makes any negative comments. Make sure you read the literature yourself and encourage your family to do so also. If possible, start madrassa classes in your home. Increase your zikr, istigfar and duas. Offer a small amount of charity on your husband’s behalf and do remain patient with him Try to welcome him home every day with a smile and Insha’Allah your duas will be accepted. Make sure your children and the rest of the family are punctual with their salaah too.\n\nMay Allah Ta’ala grant all of us the tawfeeq to be obedient to His commandments and to be steadfast with our salaah always. May He also make our salaah a means of salvation from the punishment of the kabr and the aagirah, ameen. You may write again if you wish to do so.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nSister Fadila,\nSocial Dept.\nDurban, South Africa\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
