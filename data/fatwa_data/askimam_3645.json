  "question": "What is the Islamic situation on humans born with both, male and female, sexual organs?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe jurists have discussed the laws of a hermaphrodite in great detail.\n\nThe definition of a hermaphrodite is one who is born with both male and\nfemale organs. Before majority, in an instance where urine emerges through\nthe male organ or through the male organ first, then he will be regarded as\na man and the laws that apply to man will also be applied to him. If urine\nis passed through the female organ or through the female organ first, then\nthe hermaphrodite will be considered a female.\n\nAfter maturity, if the hermaphrodite shares more the appearance and\ncharacteristic of a male or female, the hermaphrodite will be considered\naccordingly.\n\nIn a case where distinction is impossible, then the hermaphrodite will\nneither be considered a male nor female. A hermaphrodite's Salaat should be\nperformed in between the Saffs of males and females.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT. <"
