  "question": "Is cutting a tree permissible?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a massive tree on my property. My tenants are asking me to cut the tree down as they are afraid that it might fall and damage their houses. Please advice, as to how one should go about this. I heard that Jins live in trees and you must talk to the tree for 3 days before you are going to cut it. Please advice on this and what is the procedure in doing so.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\n \n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nThere is no requirement in Sharī῾ah for legitimately cutting a tree and there is no procedure in doing so. Simply cutting the tree is sufficient. \n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Zaid Mohammed Shelia,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nUSA\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
