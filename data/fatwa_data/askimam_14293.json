  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Please tell me how stuff like khatam, matam, chaaleswan and eid milad an nabi started, as it is not allowed. I want to explain this to my family who are mostly brelvis and I am not. 2. What’s difference between deobandis and the Arab hanafis? I don’t know which one of the two I fall into! Please clarify. 3. I work for a railway company and I read my salah on the train in a sitting posture (on a chair). Is salah valid like this or do you recommend repeating it? 4. I’ve heard from somewhere that after hajj when we do tawaf al wida, an angel sits on our shoulder making dua for us to return there. Is it true?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. These are new-fangled and baseless customs borrowed from the culture of our compatriots in India.\n\n2. A Deobandi is merely one who associates with the Ulama of Deoband. Effectively, there is no difference between an Arab Hanafi and a Deobandi Hanafi.\n\n3. If you sit on a chair for a valid reason, there is no need to repeat the Salaat otherwise it should be repeated. Personally, I feel it is generally possible to perform Salaat on a moving train.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
