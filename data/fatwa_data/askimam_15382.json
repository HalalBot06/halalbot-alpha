  "question": "Wasila",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question is with regards to taking wasila of pious men. If there are two persons equally pious. If one asks Allah without vasila for some thing & if the other asks allah for the same thing with wasila of some pious men, will the Allah give importance to the dua with wasila?\n\nIn other words, will the wasila have any impact on Allahs actions towards us. Because it seems to be like a person working in a company asking for promotion, stating the merrits of his colleague or his immediate boss.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAlmighty Allah Taala instructs us, “Oh you who believe, seek waseela towards Him”.\n\n \n\nIn various ahadith, Rasulullah (SAW) also advised us on waseela.\n\n \n\n As believers, our source of guidance is the Quran and Ahadith, irrespective of any rational behind the order. Nevertheless, even in a working environment, there is much consideration of waseela and adopting means for ones success. If one expresses loyalty to his immediate boss and gets promotion due to that, it is quite in order. The company respects the boss and due to his position in the company, it considers the loyalty of people to him. Pious people have closeness to Allah. Allah considers their closeness to Him and fulfills the wishes of His servants expressing their loyalty to such pious people as they are aware of the link of such pious people to Allah. In effect the waseela  through pious people is also an expression of the closeness to Allah Ta’ala.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
