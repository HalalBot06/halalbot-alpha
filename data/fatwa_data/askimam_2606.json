  "question": "Is it allowed to raise hands for dua after fardh salaah? Did Prophet (SAW) ever do this?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI read a hadith extracted from 'majma-uz-Zawaaid' vol.1, pg. 169, narrated by Abdullaah Ibn Zubayr radhi Allaahu 'anhu. Please let me know what is shari'ah's ruling?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nMaking Du'a after Salaat is established in the Hadith. Since it is\nestablished to make Du'a, it can be made collectively or individually. Both\nare permissible. However, to regard it as necessary or compulsory is\nincorrect. To lift up the hands during Du'aa, to pass the hands over the\nface after Du'aa is also established from Hadith. (Durrul Munthoor, Sharah\nAbu Dawud)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
