A quick reply for the above is highly required.Allahhaafiz.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1.It is permissible for a boy to marry the daughter of his mother's sister.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. It was the practice of some of the Sahabah to write the following dua and hang it as a ta'weez around the neck of their children: A'oozu bikalimaatillaahit taammaati min ghadhabihi wa iqaabihi wa sharri ibaadihi wa min hamazaatish shayaateeni wa ayyah dhuroonee. (Tirmidhi No.3528, and classified as Hasan Gharib)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. While haj is accepted with debts of this sort, it would be more appropriate for her to clear the debts, thus ensuring that she is no more under the curse of those who are paying interest, then when she has the means she should perform haj.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Zaitoon oil could be used for massaging a child. Kajal is generally used for children as surma burns their eyes. Kajal is eye-pencil while surma is antimony.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Refer attached%0D%0A%0D%0A6. Nabi (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) only performed one hajj. The best haj to perform is Qiran, then tamttu'.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMl.
