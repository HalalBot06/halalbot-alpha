  "question": "I heard that it is a must to do aqiqa and shave babys hair within 7 days of child birth.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThough in our area people shave the hair of thebaby within 40 days and do the aqiqa even when the baby is an year old or more. Kindly tell me which way is correct and is the aqiqa and hair cut valid if its done after seven days.Also of we live in America, wehere nobody is going to be willing to shave a 7 days old babys hair what we should do.2)Is it allowed for a wife to masterbate her husband even if she is not having her menses.Please give proof from hadith 3) If Eid is on Juma,Is it ok to leave the juma prayer and khutba if one has attended the eid prayer & khutbah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. When the baby is born, the Sunnat method is that on the seventh day after\nbirth, the hair of the baby should be shaved of and weighed. One should give\ncharity in accordance to the weight of hair. Similarly, on the same day one\nshould perform the Aqeeqa – slaughter two sheep for a baby boy and one for a\nbaby girl. The name of the baby should also be decided on this day. This is\nthe Sunnat method of carrying out the Aqeeqah. If a person does these\nactions then he will be rewarded and if he leaves them out then he will lose\nout on the reward, but he will not be sinful. If a person carries out the\nAqeeqa any time after the seventh day, then the Fuqahaa say that it will not\nearn the same amount of reward. (Aap ke Masaail vol.4 pg.445)\n2. It is necessary to understand that every single Mas-ala does not have to\nbe established directly from the Qur’aan or Hadith. This is why we are in\nneed of the Jurists who derive principles after deep study and research of\nthe Qur’aan and Hadith. Thereafter, from these principles the different and\nvarious laws and Mas-alas are extracted. In light of the above, the jurists\nhave ruled that it is permissible for the wife to masturbate her husband\neven when she is not in her menses.\n3. The Khutbah and Eid Salaat and the Khutbah and Salaat for Jummu’ah are\ntwo different commandments from Allah Ta’ala and cannot be combined.\n\nand Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
