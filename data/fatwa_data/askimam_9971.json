  "question": "Can I perform the aqeeqah for my niece? My sister recently gave birth to a baby girl that she conceived with a Hindu boy",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy sister recently gave birth to a baby girl that she conceived with a Hindu boy. They're court married and neither of them are following any religion. They intend on bringing the child up the Christian way. They don't want to listen to anything that anyone says and have finalised their decision. As the uncle, I would like to perform the aqeeqah for the baby. Can I?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is incorrect to offer Aqeqah on behalf of a non-Muslim child. If a Muslim has to adopt the child, then only will it be permissible to offer an Aqeqah on behalf of the child.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
