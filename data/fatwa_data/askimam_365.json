  "question": "When the soul leaves during sleep, why is this not a painful departure.Since it is painful when the soul leaves at death, why not when it leaves atone's sleep.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe soul has an apparent and hidden link to the body.\n\nAt the time of death, this link is detached completely resulting in pain. On the other hand, at the time of sleep, the link is only broken apparently. The hidden link is still intact resulting in no pain at all.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
