  "question": "Is my Salaat is Valid? whenever I finish passing the urine and coming out from the Toilet, 1 or 2 drops of urine comes out.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am having problem with my body. The problem is whenever I finish passing the urine and coming out from the Toilet, 1 or 2 drops of urine comes out. The same problem for my father also. After the consult and treatment of the Doctor also there is no use. In this case am I Pak or Na-Pak? Is my Namaz will be valid? Please answer to me. I am facing this problem for past 10 years. I am 30 years old now.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, for a person to begin Salaat he has to be completely at ease with regards to the drops of urine. Once a person is confident that no drops will emit from the private parts, then only may one begin to perform Wudhu.\n\nNevertheless, if the drops of urine exceed the hollow of one?s palm, it will be necessary to wash the garment before performing Salaat with them. However, if the drops are lesser than the hollow of one?s palm, it will be correct to perform Salaat in them but Makrooh (disliked). If the drops of urine emit during Salaat, the Salaat will be nullified and Wudhu will become necessary.\n\nWe suggest that after going to toilet, place a tissue around the private parts and take a few steps so that the drops of urine left may come out. Thereafter, remove the tissue and wash the private parts and then perform Wudhu.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
