  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissible for womenfolk to go to jamaat for self-reformation, following all the Asools. We have been on various occasions and found that it has given us the worry to bring Islam into our lives. Please also note we live in Europe, and we have found this the best way for us.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nTazkiyah (purification of one’s soul) and reformation was one of the three missions of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. He spent his entire life in the Tazkiyah of his Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhum]. Tazkiya is compulsory upon every Muslim. There are different ways and forms of Tazkiyah. If a person adopts any method within the framework of Shari’ah to purify and reform him/herself, that will be permissible.\n\nGoing out in Jamaat has proven effective for reforming oneself. Thousands of people around the world have witnessed this. They have gone out in Jamaat and sacrificed the comforts in their home, stayed in an Islamic environment and got into the habit of performing the daily Salaat, reciting Qur’aan and getting closer to Allah. Tazkiyah is for all – men and women. If women decide to adopt the Jamaat way to purify and reform themselves, that will be permissible, on conditions; a) They adopt complete Hijaab and they travel with their Mahrams.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
