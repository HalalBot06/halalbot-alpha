  "question": "I buy a pair of shoes for £30 but £10 of this is stolen and rest is halaal. Is it possible for me to turn the now haraam shoes into halaal by giving £10 to charity with intention of making shoes halal",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease could you tell me if it is possible to turn a haram item into a halal one. Example: I buy say a pair of shoes for £30 but £10 of this is stolen money and the rest is halaal money. Is it possible for me to turn the now haraam shoes into halaal buy giving £10 to charity with that intention of making the shoes halal. Also I am travelling to Pakistan next month inshallah and wanted to know that when I pray on the plane which time zone should I use. Say the flight is at 10 in the morning and Zuhr salat is at 12:30 uk time but if we are flying over France it is 1 hour ahead of us so do I pray at the normal 12:30 or the French time, this is difficult as I may not know which country we are flying over. Also what about Asr Maghrib and Isha do I just pray at the Uk time regardless of which country we are flying over. Please help I looked on your site but did not find an answer about the time zones.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. You may give the stolen money in charity if you are unable to locate the original owner. This will constitute the shoes becoming Halaal. One should make Tawbah and make an intention not to repeat the sin.\n\n2. In principle, you should consider the time of the country you are flying over. The times may be estimated by looking at the horizon. To determine in the different times for Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
