  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) What if someone buys the meal with no intention to win the prizes? Since he bought the meal, they gave him the coupons and he scratched it and won something, is the win considered halal?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nIf coupons are given by the vendor with the meal, it will be permissible to accept a prize from them as they are given to the customer on a voluntary basis. It is important to remember that it will only be permissible to accept a prize which is allowed in Shari’ah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
