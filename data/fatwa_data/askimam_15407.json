  "question": "Can Zakaat be given to non Muslims?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nImam of our Masjid has given Fatwa that Zakat can be given to non muslims. They give reference to the Ayah in Qur'an that it does not prohibit in detail giving zakat to nonmuslims. Can you please give your response.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAt the outset, you must understand that not all the commands are expressly mentioned in the Quraan. There are many instances where Allah would indicate a command and not elaborate. For example, lets take the command of Salaah. Allah only states \"Perform your Salaah and discharge your Zakaat\". Where in the Quraan do we find the explanation of how many Rakaats to perform for Fajr, Zuhr, Asr, Maghrib and Esha? Where in the Quraan does Allah mention the minimum amount on which Zakaat has to be discharged?\n\n \n\nSurely, these are not mentioned in the Quraan. These are explained in detail by our beloved Rasulullah ( صلى الله عليه و سلّم  ) in his Ahadith. Do not become fooled by those who only claim to follow the rulings of the Quraan and ignore the Ahadith. The Quraan and Hadith are inseparable and one can never be guided if he/she ignores any one.\n\n \n\nYou state that the Imaam has referred to an Ayah of the Quraan that states it is permissible to give Zakaat (obligatory) to non Muslims. You may ask him to forward that Ayah to us. We have not come across any such Ayah. Furthermore, the Fuqahaa are express in their works that it is not permissible to give Zakaat to non Muslims.\n\n \n\nTherefore, you should not become deceived by people who claim to only follow the Quraan. There is no need to discuss this issue in detail as any person with sound academic background would know this. If the Imaam is sincere he may contact us directly and we would engage with him on an academic level after coming to know his qualifications. We do not wish to discuss issues with someone whom we do not know as sometimes this is time consuming and a futile exercise.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Emraan Vawda\nDarul Iftaa"
