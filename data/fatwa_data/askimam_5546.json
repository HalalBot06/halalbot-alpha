  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like to know where did all of the different sects come from and why do some pple say bilaal was born a slave and some say he wasn't,that he became a slave. which one of these is true?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) Nabi alaihis salaam mentioned in a Hadith that verily Bani Israail broke%0D%0Aup into 72 groups and factions and my ummat will split up into 73 factions,%0D%0Aall of them will be in the fire of hell except one group. The Sahaba%0D%0Aradiyallahu anhum enquired of which group that was. Nabi alaihis salaam%0D%0Areplied that it will be that group who will adopt my sunnat and follow my%0D%0ASahaba radiyallahu anhum. (Miskaat pg. 30, Qadeemi Kutub Khana, Chapter on%0D%0Aholding firm onto the Kitaab and Sunnat).%0D%0A%0D%0AAll those that left aside or rejected the path%2Fgroup specified in the above%0D%0Ahadith broke up into different groups. They either exceeded the bounds in%0D%0Asome aspects of Shariat or some totally despised Shariat in action or word%0D%0Aand left it out completely. It was also the solemn promise of Shaitaan the%0D%0Aaccursed after being expelled from Jannat that he would wait in stake to%0D%0Alead the masses astray from the correct path except those sincere servants%0D%0Aof Allah Ta'ala upon whom he has no power to beguile and mislead. They would%0D%0Aremain steadfast on the guided path and they would never waver off it and%0D%0Athese are those concerning whom Nabi alaihis salaam has sounded glad tidings%0D%0Aof Jannat for. This is a basic sketch of how different sects came about in%0D%0AIslam. It will almost be impossible to detail the origin of every group%0D%0Apresently existent in the world due to the great numbers and in-depth%0D%0Ahistory of their inception.%0D%0A%0D%0A2) Bilal radiyallahu anhu was born a slave because prior to his birth, his%0D%0Amother was already a slave who belonged to one of the tribes in Makkah%0D%0AMukarramah. (Usdul Ghaabah by Muhammad bin Hasan Al-Jazri, vol. 1 pg. 237,%0D%0ADarul Ma'rifah).%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
