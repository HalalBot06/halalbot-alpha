  "answer": "QUESTION\ndear sheikh i want to know whether there is a hidith on the distance apart of your feet while praying salah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nWe have not come across any Hadith that stipulates the distance between the feet in Salaah. A Musali (one performing Salaah), must keep such a distance between his feet in Salaah that he is comfortable with. This distance will differ according to the stature of different individuals. Therefore, the feet must not be kept very wide nor very close, but a distance that is moderate according to the stature/built of a Musali.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nWassalam,\n\nMaulana Muhammed Zakariyya Desai\nDarul Iftaa\n\n\n\n============================================\n\nEID MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\nIt is the grace of Almighty Allah Ta’ala that He granted us life to witness another Eid. For that we make shukr to Allah. The occasion of Eid ul Adha reminds us of the great personality of Ibraheem alayhi salaam and his submissions to the orders of Allah.\n\nAllah says, “ and remember when Allah tested Ibraheem alayhi salaam and Ibraheem alayhi salaam fulfilled all the orders of Allah. It was this submission and subjugation of Ibraheem alayhi salaam that is remembered on the day of Eid ul Adhaa.\n\nIbraheem alayhi salaam did not have a child until old age. Allah granted him Isma’eel alayhi salaam. The intense love of Ibraheem alayhi salaam for Isma’eel alayhi salaam cannot be really comprehended by us. Ibraheem alayhi salaam was ordered to sacrifice his beloved son.\n\nThat is naturally a very difficult order to carry out, but Ibraheem alayhi salaam still submitted without any reservations. It is this spirit of his submission and subjugation that is so loved by Allah that year in, year out Ibraheem alayhi salaam’s submission to the order of Allah is celebrated and spoken about.\n\nOn this occasion we should reflect on ourselves. And examine ourselves and examine our level of submission to the orders of Allah. While we sacrifice the animal and the blood gushes out, ponder upon the virtue of that animal. It is used for an act of great worship. It has become useful for mankind. Can I at least match the animal in its sacrifice?\n\nIn this time and age of Islamic history, the ummah faces the greatest challenge of submission to Allah against many pressures.\n\nOur submission to Allah dictates that we make sacrifice and be steadfast on Deen. Do not succumb to different pressures and compromise your Deen.\n\nIbraheem alayhi salaam submitted against all odds. We too should follow the footsteps of Ibraheem alayhi salaam and submit to the order of Allah against any odd we may be faced with, be it as a husband, as a father, as a wife, as a mother, as a relative, as a friend or as a devout Muslim; against such laws and pressures that are against Islam and Shariah.\n\nWe live as Muslims and die as Muslims. The reward from Allah is based on sacrifice.\n\nThe askimam.org site will resume on January 15th 2007\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDecember 28th, 2006\n\n============================================\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n1. When the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n2. The guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\n3. Education and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\n4. Islam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\n5. When one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\n6. Muslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\n7. We have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\n8. If you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\n9. If that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\n10.Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit”.\n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
