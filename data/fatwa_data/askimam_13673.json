  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy mom lets my younger sister go out to school football games and things like this often at night. When she goes, she wears shorts and t-shirts and they are very tight. When my mom is here, I don't try and stop her, but I do mention to my mom about it and try to get her to rethink it.\n\nHowever, if I am alone at the house I stop my sister from going out like that because I'm the responsible person in the house and Allah Ta'Ala would question me even more. My sister yells at me and even beats me up and tells a different story to my mom later.\n\nMy mom gets mad at me for this, she said, \"She is covered\" and I said, \"She's not 'covered', she just 'colored', you can still see everything (shapes).\" And I told my mom that she can guarantee that if I am here and my sister is going outside like that, I will not let her and that she can count on it. I didn't yell at my mom, but I felt bad for being so stern about this, is this incorrect for me to be stern?\n\nHow can I be better to my mother without giving in on any of the Islamic principles and encourage my mother to have the girls dress modestly?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nNahy anil Munkar (to stop a wrong) is the responsibility of every Muslim. It is Haraam and strictly prohibited for a girl to wear shorts or tight fitting clothing. If she leaves the house in that state, she enters into the curse of the angels and incurs the wrath of Allah on her. The wrath of Allah will also be upon all those who are responsible for such an act.\n\nAlhamdulillah, Allah chose you to condemn a wrong in your family and reform your family. You should remain steadfast in that. You may be respectfully stern to your mother in stopping the wrong if a soft and humble approach is not appreciated.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
