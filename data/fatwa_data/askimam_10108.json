  "question": "A sad story about leading salaah in need of bath. what should be the procedure to inform our new generations that masturbation is haraam and makes compulsory bath neccessary?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have a friend who committed a great evil indeed. When he was young nobody told him that masturbation was haram; he 'discovered' it. He 'liked it' and carried on masturbating even after he became mature. Even then, although hard to believe, he still didn't know it was haraam. Now that certainly wasn't the biggest problem. Besides that evil habit, he was 'pious' as people referred to him. They as well as me obviously didn't know the truth. So we made him lead salaat, and he was in that state; he didn't know the masala that it makes bath neccessary, and he went and led, of course unintentionally. If he'd known then he would never have led the salaat. He can't remember who he led or how many times. How should he explain to those that he can remeber leading to repeat their salaah, including me. What should he do? How can he remedy this disastrous situation? I want to help him; it's pitiable, and he is so sorry. If you can answer these queries, my respected scholar, he, as well as I, will be ever so grateful. Also, what should be the procedure to inform our new generations that masturbation is haraam and makes compulsory bath neccessary?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nI have mixed feelings, negative as well as positive when reading the details of the question. The reason for the negative feelings is obvious. However, it is also encouraging to note that the person regrets his ignorance and brings courage to remedy the situation. %0D%0A%0D%0AThat is a stepping stone for reformation and personality building. Many people hide their shortcoming and don?t address them. They will never progress. Nevertheless, the brother should make sincere tawba and never repeat the act again. He must repeat all his salats he remembers having performed in that condition. If he does not remember exactly, he should follow his honest and sincere estimation. Similarly, he should inform his congregation or whoever he remembers to repeat their salah. He should also apologize to them. He may do that in writing and place it for sometime at the Musjid Notice Board. %0D%0A%0D%0AThere is no need for him to explain the exact reason for repeating the salah. He may state that he was a Mazoor(excused) person in Shariah and was not supposed to perform the Salah. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
