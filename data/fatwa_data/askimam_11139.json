  "question": "views on politics. Although the Tableeghis and Deobandis are such a great number in India they didn’t stop the Qur’an prohibition but a small group of Jamati Islami died to stop this prohibition",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI agree with all of your teachings except for that regarding politics. You claim what the Tableeghi brothers are doing (Da?wah work) is amrbilma?rufwannahyanilmunkar. However the prophet has told us that the latter is to stop evil with our hands, if not with our tongues or at least detest it. But the large group of Deobandis didn?t stop prostitution in Bangladesh but a small group of Jamati Islami. Although the Tableeghis and Deobandis are such a great number in India they didn?t stop the Qur?an prohibition but a small group of Jamati Islami died to stop this prohibition. When a historical Mosque was being broken by nonMuslims Moulana Asad Madani with all his power didn?t move a hand. And the list goes on. Why is it that the government of non-Muslim countries fear the Ikhwaan/Jamaat-i-Islami and do not care about Deobandis? Your main purpose is to spread the true Shari?ah across the Muslim world. However how are we to support Shari?ah without an Islamic state? The purpose of prophethood was to establish deen (He sent his messenger with guidance/ the true religion to make it prevalent over other religions: Surah Saff). Muslims at the prophet?s time were prosecuted right from the start. There are enough Muslims in the world today. The Sahabah weren?t all perfect. What you are looking for ? we all become spiritually ideal Muslims then an Islamic state will form automatically is unrealistic. Respected Mufti, can you please tell me your views on politics and why my view is wrong\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIslam is not against politics but it forms an integral part of Islam.\n\nThe Deobandis are not against politics. It is just that they don?t wish to meddle in today?s ?dirty? politics. They are employing a more positive approach in spreading the Deen of Allah. Sure, we need to work towards the establishment of a proper Islamic state but we do also need proper leaders and good Muslims.\n\nWe commend all the other movements who are doing good work.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
