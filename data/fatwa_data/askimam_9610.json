  "question": "When does life begin (concerning abortion)??? Everyone has different opinions. But what does ISLAM say about this",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am asking this question concerning abortion. When does life begin? Is it when fertilization happens or is it when the soul is first put in the baby or when the heart starts pumping first? ? Because can one just do abortion at any time becuase they want to? I mean compared to islam, does life begin at fertilization so abortion becomes haraam since then??\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the understanding of one Hadith, the soul enters the body on the 120 day upon conception. The Fuqahaa have ruled that it is prohibited to abort after that, irrespective of any circumstances. To abort before 120 days without a reason valid and acceptable in Shari?ah.\n\nA reason valid and acceptable in Shari?ah, can only be ruled by an upright, pious and competent Mufti.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
