  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am the second wife ,my husband went away from me when I was pregnant with 2nd daughter 14yrs ago(1st daughter 16 yrs),now he is back , he wants to have a life with us,but his 1st wife (who can't have kids)does not wantÂ him to be part of my kids or my life.I want my kids to have a father.What are my right to this & is my nikh still valid?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf your husband did not divorce you, your marriage to him is still intact despite the separation. It is compulsory upon your husband to fulfill his rights as a father to his children. His first wife cannot stop him from that. He cannot fulfill his wish to stay away from his children and yourself. If your husband wants to return home and be part of the family, you should welcome him and advise him to fulfill his role as a Muslim husband and father.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
