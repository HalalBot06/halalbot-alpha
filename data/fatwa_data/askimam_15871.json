Mazi is considered impure(napaak)\n\na) The emitting of mazi(pre coital fluid) prior to the ejaculation of mani(spermatic fluid) is a necessity when engaging in intercourse. Although it is impure, she should not feel bad about it since it is a necessary requirement for intercourse to take place.\n\nb) The fard ghusal is not compulsory on both of you; however it is necessary to wash the areas upon which the mazi has reached.\n\n) قَوْلُهُ : لَا عِنْدَ مَذْيٍ ) أَيْ لَا يُفْرَضُ الْغُسْلُ عِنْدَ خُرُوجِ مَذْيٍ\n\n(Raddul Muhtaar Vol. 1. Pg. 152 H M Saeed)\n\nc) Your wudhu will break with the emitting of mazi, and it will be necessary that you wash mazi off from whichever area it reached too on your body.\n\n. )لَا ) عِنْدَ ( مَذْيٍ أَوْ وَدْيٍ ) بَلْ الْوُضُوءُ مِنْهُ وَمِنْ الْبَوْلِ جَمِيعًا عَلَى الظَّاهِرِ\n\n(Raddul Muhtaar Vol.1. Pg. 152)\n\nThe wudhu of your wife will not break, but it will be necessary for her to wash the places on her body where the mazi had touched.\n\n2. If your wife`s hair is plaited then it is not necessary for her to open the plaits and wash all the hair. It will suffice her to make the water reach to the roots of the hair. However if her hair is not plaited then it will be necessary that water reaches all the hair on her head no matter how long the hair is .\n\n    أَنَّ { أُمَّ يَ اللَّهُ عَنْهَا سَأَلَتْ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ فَقَالَتْ : إنِّي أَشُدُّ ضَفْرَ رَأْسِي أَفَأَنْقُضُهُ إذَا اغْتَسَلْت فَقَالَ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ أسَلَمَةَ رَضَِفِيضِي الْمَاءَ عَلَى رَأْسِك ، وَسَائِرِ جَسَدِك ، وَيَكْفِيك إذَا بَلَغَ الْمَاءُ أُصُولَ شَعْرِك } ، وَلِأَنَّ ضَفِيرَتَهَا إذَا كَانَتْ مَشْدُودَةً فَتَكْلِيفُهَا نَقْضُهَا يُؤَدِّي إلَى الْحَرَجِ ، وَلَا حَرَجَ حَالَ كَوْنِهَا مَنْقُوضَةٌ ، وَالْحَدِيثُ مَحْمُولٌ عَلَى هَذِهِ الْحَالَةِ\n\n (Badaai us Sanaai Vol.1.
