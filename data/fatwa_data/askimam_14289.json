It is permissible to wear slippers and perform Salaah on condition there is no apparent impurities on them.\n\n2. Rasulullah () has prohibited a woman to travel for 88 KM or more without a Mahram. Therefore, it is not permissible for a woman of any age to perform Umrah without a Mahram.\n\n3. If the husband has not issued a Talaaq, she is still considered as his wife. If he passes away, she will have to sit in Iddah and will receive a share from his estate.\n\n4. Firstly, all effort should be made to recite the Quraan. However, if that is not possible due to old age, someone could be assigned be read. If that is not possible, the person who cannot read may listen to a recitation through a cassette or CD player.\n\n5. Whoever does not believe in Allah and Muhammed () as His messenger is a Mushrik.\n\n6. It is important to investiage the authenticyt of the names that are read. There have been booklets printed with Rasulullah () name some of which were incorrect. Asmaa ul Husnaa have been mentioned in authentic Ahadith and are read with the intention of Allah fulfilling ones needs and requests. However, it is incorrect to recite Nabi () name with this intention. Allah is the being that fulfills our need not Nabi (). Instead you should recite Durood and Salaat on Nabi (). This will earn you reward and attract the mercy of Allah and the intercession of Nabi ().\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai\nStudent: Darul Ifta\n\nChecked And Approved: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
