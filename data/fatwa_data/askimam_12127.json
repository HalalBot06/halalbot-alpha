  "question": "Sunnah is to clean your teeth or use a stick?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe have a controversy about what is meaning and purpose of miswak, practically. There is no doubt it is a great sunnah and all of us should follow it. But question is what is meant by doing miswak. If it means to clean your mouth and teeth then a modern toothbrush can do this job lot better than a stick of wood no matter from which tree it is. But some brothers don?t agree with this and they don?t consider use of toothbrush as doing miswak. I understand using stick of wood is more closer to sunnah but at the same time stress of this sunnah is on cleaning and not on wood. So I think toothbrush is lot better than miswak as it addresses actual purpose more effectively, five times a day, than a piece of wood. It is just like we use watches to calculate salat times and use modern cloth for our clothes. No body is following same methods as Prophet (PBUH) and his companions used to do. What is your opinion on this?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe actual sunnah is to use the Miswaak of a twig. The toothbrush is simply permissible, not Sunnah.\n\nSpecific virtues have been mentioned about the twig. There are no specific virtues regarding the clothing found in former times. The watch is a guide. Even in this age, the original and more reliable method remains the natural phenomenonm used to determine the Salaat time.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
