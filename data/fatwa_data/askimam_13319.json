  "answer": "QUESTION\n A friend of mine is opening an exterminating bussiness (one that kills roaches/insects/etc) for resteraunts and commercial companies. Is it halal for him to provide these services to kafirs or can he only provide services to muslims. Or is he allowed to service both with no problems.  He currently lives in the United States. Looking forward to your answer. Jazak Allah Khairun\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is permissible to own a business that deals with killing insects and rodents etc. The job may be done for a Muslim and non Muslim.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
