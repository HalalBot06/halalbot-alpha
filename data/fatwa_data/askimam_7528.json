  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen reading istikarah on 2 different occasions i had 3 dreams about another boy who i liked but cannot marry as i am older than him (5 years). 1st dream- I was packing my bag to go to his sisters house and I was happy because he was going to be there. 2nd dream- along similar lines. 3rd dream- i was pregnant and getting married and my family was hugging and congratulating me. I was very happy and then i saw i was going to marry this same boy. Could the fact that i liked him or was in contact with him have influenced my dream or do they mean anything? I was not thinking of him when reading istikarah and was surprised by the dreams.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, we wish to point out that there is nothing wrong in marrying a person younger that you. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was 15 years junior to Hadhrat Khadija (Radhiallaahu Anha) when he married her. Upon her proposal, she was 40 years of age while Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was 25 years of age.\n\nIf you were performing Istikhaara to marry a person and there is no indication of that in the dream, then you should make Istikhaara again until you are certain of your decision.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
