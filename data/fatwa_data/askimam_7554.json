  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn Surah Mariam, her people address her as ?sister of Haroon?. Is this ?Haroon? different from brother of Prophet Moses (a.s)? 2) How were the following related to each other: Mariam, Zakaria, Yahya, Imran, Esa (a.s)?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe name, Haroon? in the Aayat does not refer to the brother of Moosa (Alayhis salaam). Yahya was the son of Zakariyyah (Alayhis salaam) and Imraan (Alayhis salaam) was the Imaam of Baytul Maqdis and Eesa (Alayhis salaam) was the son of Maryam (Alayhas salaam).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
