  "question": "All house windows and doors must be closed between Asr and Magrib time...Reciting Bismillah before medicine.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs there any truth or wisdom in the following:\n\nAll house windows and doors must be closed between Asr and Magrib time.\nWhen taking medication one must not recite Bismillah as medicine is not a good thing in the sense it is not food.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThere is no real significance in closing the windows at Magrib time. However, If there is a narration wherein Nabi (صلى الله عليه وسلم ) said that the Shayateen return at Maghrib time back and therefore keep your children indoors. It is perhaps because of this Hadith we find this practice.\nIt is narrated that Nabi (صلى الله عليه وسلم) used to remember Allah whenever he undertook any work. Therefore, one should recite Bismillah before taking medication with the belief that the medicine is only the means of cure. The Real Shaafi (curer) is Allah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
