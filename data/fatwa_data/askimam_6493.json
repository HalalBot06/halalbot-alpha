  "question": "Can the sons of a deceased man inherit from their uncle upon his death?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy uncle died. He has one wife, 3 sisters, and 3 nephews and one niece from his deceased brothers. Do the nephews inherit? If so, how much.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, it must be pointed out that the heirs of an Estate may only\nbe determined upon one's demise.\n\nAccording to the Islamic Law of Succession and Inheritance, distribution of\nan Estate will only commence after funeral expenses, debts and bequests (if\nany) made to non-heirs - which will not exceed one-third (1/3) of the Estate\nafter debts and funeral expenses - have been settled. Thereafter, all assets\nform part of the Net Estate and will have to be distributed according to the\nIslamic Law of Succession and Inheritance.\n\nThe estate will be divided into 36 equal shares and distributed as follows:\nWife receives 9 shares, each sister receives 8 shares and each nephew\nreceives 1 share.\n\nThe niece does not inherit.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
