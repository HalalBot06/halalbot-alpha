It is Sunnah to cover the head when going to the toilet. One may use the%0D%0Asame Topi used for Salaat.%0D%0A2. Wet dreams are not a sign of hypocrisy. There are many factors that can%0D%0Acause an increase in wet dreams. Some factors are psychological, e.g. diet,%0D%0Aetc. and some factors are spiritual, e.g. not guarding the gaze. Make%0D%0Aendervour to practise on the Shari'ah and Sunnah and thereafter do not be%0D%0Abothered by an increase in wet dreams.%0D%0A3. Bay'at means to take a pledge of allegiance. This is generally undertaken%0D%0Aby placing one's hands in the hands of the one on which one is taking Bay'at%0D%0Aand reciting the words of allegiance. In the case of Bay'at of Tariqah (Bay'%0D%0Aat at the hands of a spiritual guide), it is essential to first establish a%0D%0AMunaasabat (congeniality) with the Shaykh and one must have absolute%0D%0Aconfidence in him. Then only will there be true benefit in the Bay'at.%0D%0A4. One may claim from the one who has done you harm. Even if the person%0D%0Aacquires the claimed amount from his insurance company, it will be%0D%0Apermissible for you to accept it.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
