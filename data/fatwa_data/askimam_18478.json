  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nI’m doing a business investment with a broker whereby I am investing the money on a capital guaranteed basis for 12 months. In profit we are 50/50 in loss the capital is guaranteed. Kindly advice if this is this Shariah compliant.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh  \n\n \n\nThe underlined principle with regards to profit and loss in partnership and business investments is:\n\n \n\nالربح على ما شرطا والوضيعة على قدر المالين \n\nThe profit is based on the agreement of the parties, but the loss will always be proportionate to the capital investment. \n\n \n\nHence, the condition that the capital is guaranteed at the time of loss is impermissible. If you have given 50% of the capital, you will be liable of 50% of the debt if the investment suffers a loss.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
