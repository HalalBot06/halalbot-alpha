  "question": "How much does clear/white vaginal discharge have to spread before breaking wudu?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow much does clear/white vaginal discharge have to spread before it breaks wudu? What if you have this discharge many many times a day? On tazkiya.net it said if the discharge is clear it will not break, is this true, and what if it is a little white? In the case of istihadah, what if you do wudu 5 to 15 minutes before prayer and there is discharge before or during prayer? Are clothes with the discharge clean or must they be washed?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAny amount of discharge invalidates Wudhu. If the discharge is before or during Salat, the Salaat will have to be repeated and the affected area of clothes must be washed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
