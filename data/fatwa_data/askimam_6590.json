  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am having problem during prayers. While I am praying I think about other stuff and this is not under my control. Many times I forget, if I have said enough rakats. What should I do? Is there any prayer that I should say to keep my family (brothers, sisters, parents, wife and kids etc) healthy, happy, united and to follow Allah's orders?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\na) Q: What is the remedy to evil thoughts?%0D%0AA: Evil thoughts are a sign of Imaan. The noble companions complained to%0D%0ANabi (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa sallam) of evil thoughts to which he replied by%0D%0Asaying, 'That is a clear sign of Imaan.' (Mishkaat pg.18; Me'raaj)%0D%0AThe mind is like a highway. Today a king or pious person would pass over it,%0D%0Atomorrow a beggar or evil person will pass by. Similarly one experiences%0D%0Agood thoughts (of performing Salaat, reciting the noble Qur'aan, etc.), as%0D%0Awell as evil thoughts. One should avoid seeing or doing anything that invite%0D%0Asuch thoughts.If the thoughts are not articulated, one will not be%0D%0Aanswerable for them. Evil thoughts are like live electric wires. If one pays%0D%0Aattention to them by touching them, he will get shocked.Similarly, one%0D%0Ashould ignore evil thoughts and engage in something useful. One may also%0D%0Aread 'Laa hawla Walaa Quwaata Illaa billahi al-Aliyy al-Adheem' (There is no%0D%0Apower - to refrain from evil - nor ability - to do good - except with Allah,%0D%0Athe Most High, the Exalted).%0D%0A%0D%0Ab) Recite the following Du'aa after every Fardh Salaat, \"Our Lord! Grant us%0D%0Afrom amongst our wives and children 'coolness of the eyes' (i.e. comfort),%0D%0Aand make us leaders of the Muttaq%EEn (Allah-conscious people). [S%FBrah Furq%E2n%0D%0AVerse 74]%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
