  "answer": "QUESTION\nImam Ibn Taimiyya(r.h) says that all the Hadith which imply that Muhammed (sallahu alaihay wassallam) is/was the reason for creation of this universe (Maqsood-e-Kainaat) are mawdo/dhaeed) and he says the purpose of creation was this verse (only) \" 51: 56. And I have not created the jinn and the men but that they may worship ME\" but i have heard in the biyaans of many deoband ulama \"Muhammed (s.a.s) was the purpose of creation (of this universe)\"? b) why do Ulama discourage 'Shirt Collars' even in Shalwar Kameez?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There is no reason for claiming the fabrication of such Ahaadith. In%0D%0Afact, there is no contradiction whatsoever between this verse of the holy%0D%0AQur'aan and those Ahaadith. Because, although the world was created for the%0D%0Apurpose of worship, it was Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) who was%0D%0Athe best and most exalted worshipper of Allah and this Aayat implies that if%0D%0Ait were not for those who worshipped Allah, He would have not created man%0D%0Aand Jinn.%0D%0AMoreover, this Aayat only discusses the purpose and not the reason for the%0D%0Acreation of man and Jinn only, whereas those Ahaadith discuss the reason and%0D%0Anot the purpose for which the entire universe (and not only man and Jinn)%0D%0Awas created. Allah Ta'ala says in the holy Qur'aan, 'And we have not sent%0D%0Ayou except as a mercy for the worlds'. It is accepted by one and all that if%0D%0Athis was not for the mercy of Allah, the universe would not remain intact%0D%0Aeven for a single moment. And in this case, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) was chosen as the form of that mercy. So, it would be safe to say,%0D%0A'If it were not for Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), the world%0D%0Awould have not been in existence.'%0D%0A2. We do not see any reason for the discouraging of the collar.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
