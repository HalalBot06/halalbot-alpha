Ulama suggest that if a person has several years of Qada Salaat and he does not remember the number of Salaat he missed, neither does he remember the time of the Salaats, then he should adopt the following method in completing his missed Salaats:\n\n1)      It will suffice for a person to merely say in his intention that this is a qada of the first (or last) Salaat he missed. Example, he should make intention that he is making qada of the first (or last) Dhuhr Salaat which he missed. Once the qada of this Salaat is complete, the second Salaat which he missed will take the place of the first, and likewise when that is completed the third will now be the first; hence, on every prayer he can merely suffice by saying ‘Ya Allah, I am making the qada of the first (or last) prayer I missed.\n\n2)      Instead of reading Nawaafil Salaat a person should pay more attention on his Qada Salaat first.\n\n3.      A person should read at least one Qada Salaat with every Fard Salaat, by adopting this method Inshallah a time would come when all his Qada Salaat would be fulfilled.\n\n(Fataawa Mahmoodiyah Vol 7, Pg364)\n\nThe same method should be adopted for Qada fast; for every fast missed, one should make the niyyah that this is his first (or last) fast which he missed. He should continue with this intention until he has total conviction that he has terminated all his Qadha fasts.\n\n \n\nوأما النفل فقال في المضمرات : الاشتغال بقضاء الفوائت أولى وأهم من النوافل إلا سنن المفروضة \n\n(رد المحتار ج2 ,ص74)\n\n \n\nكثرت الفوائت نوى أول ظهر عليه أو آخره\n\n(الدر المختار ج2 ,ص76)\n\n \n\nمن لا يدري كمية الفوائت يعمل بأكبر رأيه فإن لم يكن له رأي يقض حتى يتيقن أنه لم يبق عليه شيء\n\n(حاشية الطحطاوى ,ص447)\n\n \n\nوإذا كثرت الفوائت يحتاج لتعيين كل صلاة فإن أراد تسهيل الأمر عليه نوى أول ظهر عليه أو آخره وكذا الصوم من رمضانين\n\n(نور الإيضاح - ص 100)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMl.
