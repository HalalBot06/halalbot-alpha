  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nQ13937? What if the manager is the employee of the guest house\n\nI was reading your fatwa 13937 about guest house agent taking money from other guest house.\n\nI have a question further to it.\n\n- What if the manager is the employee of the guest house (not the owner, which seems to be the case in fatwa 13937 and the owners even don't know what is going on).\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf the employee does not have the consent of the owner to find accommodation elsewhere, then he cannot use his employment time to find accommodation. He may do so in his spare time. He could charge a fee for the service rendered to people for finding accommodation during his spare time.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
