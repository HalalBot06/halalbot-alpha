  "question": "After urinating, sometimes after walking about 40 steps, some urine soils the clothing, then if one proceeds to make wudhu, will the person be Taahir?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf one is certain that the remains of urine came out after walking and it\nsoiled the clothing, the subsequent Wudhu will be valid, but merely making\nWudhu does not make the clothing Taahir (pure). The soiled portion of the\nclothing will remain impure and must be washed in order for Salaat to be\nvalid as Salaat with impurity on clothes is not valid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
