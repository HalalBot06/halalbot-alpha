  "question": "Is a Nikka valid if the husband does not regard the person he has married as a wife ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf the man has made nikka for the second time and taken a second wife but says that he does not think that he will be able to regard her as a wife does this make the nikka valid ? Can the women stay married knowing she will never be recognised as a wife ? Can she ask for a Talak ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOnce a person is married, he has to regard the woman he married as his wife.\nHe has to fulfil her marital rights. If he does not do so, he will be\nsinful.\n\nIt is irresponsible of a person to marry a woman and think he will not be\nable to regard her as a wife. Why then did he marry her? However, such a\nstatement does not constitute divorce.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
