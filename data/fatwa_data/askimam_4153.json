  "question": "Salam. Something about Muslims, and Kaffir's disgusting guts...",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam. 1st) What should I do if a Muslim person who is 16 knows the Kalima but does not want to read it, for some reason. 2nd) What should I do? I go to school but when I see kaffirs i want to kill and not be with them because I think they are immature that they do not belive in ALLAH. I know I should try to make them Muslims but I want to treat them hard way like how they treat us Muslims all over the world and call us terrorists and they hit women at school for being Muslims like the girl in Boston and then she prayed outside and Muslims came to help but we can only take so much... Advice me please. Wasalam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1)We do not understand the details of your first question. Kindly Rephrase.\n2) Allah Taala describes some qualities of his pious servants. Among them,\none is when the ignorant speak to them they say salaam (avoid them with\nwisdom and diplomacy). We advise you apply wisdom and do not re-act to any\nstatement made by non-muslims. We should rather display good character and\nhumility.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
