  "question": "Is otoplasty surgery permissible in order to normalize protruding ears?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it possible if you can advise whether otoplasty is permissible or not? I know that it is not allowed to beautify a person. However I don’t want it for the purpose of beautifying; I just want my ears to look normal to everyone else’s, as my ears appear to be prominent.\n\nI am considering otoplasty, which is a small operation that pins the ears back, but not too much. It doesn’t reduce the size of the ears or reshapes them; it just puts them back so they don’t stick out as much. However one of my ears sticks out more than the other one, so I just want them to look equal on both sides. Everyone in my family shares the same opinion. Can you please advise before I consider proceeding?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nIt will be permissible for you to undergo the otoplasty surgery in order to bring your ears to the normal position.\n\n \n\nفي الخانية: وفي الفتاوى: إذا أراد الرجل أن يقطع إصبعا زائدة أو شيئا آخر قال أبو نصر رحمه الله تعالى: إن كان الغالب على من قطع مثل ذلك الهلاك فإنه لا يفعل لأنه تعريض النفس للهلاك وإن كان الغالب هو النجاة فهو في سعة من ذلك\n( فتاوى قاضيخان: 3/313 ، دار الكتب العلمية )\n\n( وكذا في الفتاوى الهندية: 5/440 ، دار الكتب العلمية )\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMl.
