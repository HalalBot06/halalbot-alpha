  "question": "Can Deaf woman marry sunni, urdu, surtee,and any tribe? Let me know if i can marry someone for tribe?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA woman may marry whomsoever she wants to. Islam does not discriminate against the deaf, blind, tribe or the like. The most important thing is that both the parties are in agreement, this marriage can take place. A word of advice as stipulated by Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is to look for a pious partner.\n\nIt is also important to consider compatibility in Nikah as both partners will be living close to one another. Any non-compatibility in such a close relationship may result in often disagreements and disputes. That in turn may affect the actual marriage.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
