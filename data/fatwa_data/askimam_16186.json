  "question": "The daughter insists on marrying a non Muslim. What should the parents do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is the position of  parents if their daughter wants to get married to a non-Muslim who doesn't want to become a Muslim. Even if they reject she will go ahead. What is the responsibility of parents in Islam in such a situation.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf the parents had made proper tarbiyyat (nurturing and upbringing) of their daughter, she would not consider getting married to a non-Muslims as that is haram. If the parents are guilty of neglecting their daughter and if she commits a wrong, they will be sinful. The girl’s attitude of total disregard to her parents may be due to the freedom they had given her. They are now suffering the consequences of that freedom. They have only themselves to blame. They should make tawba and do whatever is within their means and power to stop her from the wrong. They know the temperament of their daughter. They should adopt an attitude towards her (hard, soft, diplomatic etc) which will be most affective. For that, the parents may also consult with appropriate people, Ulama and family members.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
