  "question": "What is the ruling if a person forgets to read Qunoot and does not make sajda-e-sahoo?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, to recite Qunoot in the Witr Salaat is Waajib. If one forgetfully omits a Waajib act, he must compensate for it by performing Sajdah-e-Sahw. If he did not make Sajdah-e-Sahw, he must repeat the Witr Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
