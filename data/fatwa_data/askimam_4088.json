  "question": "Salam, I want to know if it is ok for a Muslim boy to TRUELY love a non-musim girl who will become a Muslim in a month. We love each other a lot for sure. Wassalam",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have helped this American girl through her most hardest time in her life like domestic and other problems but we know each other on the internet but I am still able to help her and now she is in love with me because of how we are and I am in love with her too, I really am, I feel it all the time. I think of her a lot and she does too. And in one month after Eid I am going to see her and will help her become a good Muslim. She likes Islam. So is it okay if we are together like that and love each other? Please she means a lot to me and tell me a good possible answer you can like you always do, sir. Thank you Wassalam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIslam strictly prohibits every type of premarital relationship. The\nconsequences of such a relationship are too ghastly to mention. Some are: a)\nIllicit relationship, b) Abortion, c) Illigitimate child, etc.\n\nWe advise you make suitable arrangements by linking the girl to a scholar\n(Aalim) through the internet to invite her to Islam and answer any possible\nqueries she may have. If you truly love her, you may propose marriage to her\nafter she accepts Islam. If she accepts, you may marry her. It is not\npermissible for you to have any communication with her before marriage.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
