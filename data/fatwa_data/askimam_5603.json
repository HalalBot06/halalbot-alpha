  "question": "Is it permissible to recite kalma , Qurani ayats, duas when partially naked ( wearing shorts)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe area between the navel and knee for a male is Satr (to be compulsorily\ncovered).\n\nIt is not permissible to have that area open in front of anyone besides the\nwife. It is, therefore, advisable that the shorts cover the knees. It is\npermissible but discouraged to recite the Qur'aan and make Dhikr while\nwearing shorts that expose some part of the above knee.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
