  "answer": "QUESTION\nI just wanted to know if it is OK to buy a used mattress couple of years old from a non-muslim (As they dont have the concept of purity/impurity) as new mattresses are expensive and my stay in USA(with my wife) may not  be very long.  What should be done to make the mattress pure/paak. Is simply covering the mattress with a sheet and sleeping on it is ok. May Allah(swt) reward you.\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is permissible to buy a used mattress from a non-Muslim. The sheet on the mattress would suffice for the possible impurities on it.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
