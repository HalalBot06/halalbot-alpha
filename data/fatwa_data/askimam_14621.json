  "question": "Is it permissible to accept gifts from non-Muslims?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamu Alaikum.\n\n \n\n \n\nI have a few questions that I would like answered.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1. Is it permissible to accept gifts from non-Muslims?\n\n \n\n \n\nDoes the ruling change if you know that the non-Muslim has given this gift through haraam money? For example, if a non-Muslim wins the lottery, will it be permissible for a Muslim to accept a gift from that money?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2. If a Muslim sells something to a non-Muslim, is it permissible for that Muslim to take money from the non-Muslim even though the Muslim knows that the non-Muslim’s money is from a haraam source?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3. Is there a general rule here? Is it permissible to accept the money of a non-Muslim regardless of how they have acquired this wealth?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Is there a different ruling for money gained through alcohol sales and money acquired through bank interest? I have heard that Hadhrat Umar radhiyallahu anhu accepted jizyah from the Ahle-Kitaab which was from their sale of alcohol and pigs.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5. In view of the above, will it be permissible for Muslims to benefit from schemes that are funded by the National Lottery?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nJazakumullahu Khairan.\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\n1)     it is permissible to accept a gift from non-Muslims on condition one will not be required to compromise on Deen and that the gift is not un Islamic, for example, Wine or a cross. Lottery is Haram.\n\n \n\n2)     It is permissible to deal with non Muslims. That includes buying and selling. We are not responsible for their Haram income. The money paid by them is in lieu of the sales to them.\n\n \n\n3)     Ref.2\n\n \n\n4)     Your question is general and includes many possibilities. One possibility is a non Muslim purchases an item from a Muslim and pays through his proceeds of wine or through his intests. That will be permissible for a Muslim as it will fall in the category of dealings and not gifts.\n\n \n\n5)     In order for me to comment, I have to understand how the national lottery operates an conjunction with the schemes.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
