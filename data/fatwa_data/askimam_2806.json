  "question": "How to negate Qadiani's beliefs and if I cant, can I leave the person on his haal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamoAlaikum, One of my sunni friends became Qadiani a few years back. I unsuccessfully tried with my limited knowledge to correct him. He did Istakhara and is convinced Qadianism is right. He is in Lahore and has also taken on a few Molana as challenge, who could not convince him. Now he even preaches it over the net etc, and has convinced a few people himself! He writes to me now and then asking me to accept it. He asked me to do Istakhara as well, but Mufti Zubair from South Africa(who was in UK then) stopped, me saying it is not permissible to do so on such matters which r clear in the Quran. My question are: 1)Is it somewhere clearly said in the Holy book about these issues? 2)How do i tackle him? I am sure u know their arguments and all. 3)If I cant, do i leave him as he is? Considering that he is spreading his words very fast and very vast, it might not be good. JazakAllah Khair, and hope to read from u soon. May Allah guide us all. Please remember me, and us all in your dua'as. Wassalam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly find information below%0D%0A%0D%0AAlso, kindly refer to http:%2F%2Fwww.irshad.org%2Fidara%0D%0A%0D%0ASalaams%0D%0A%0D%0AQADIANISM - IN REPLY TO MIRZA TAHIR%0D%0A%0D%0A2 - Mirza Ghulam Ahmad - a False Prophet%0D%0A%0D%0AQadianis Disobey their Sire Mirza Ghulam Ahmad%0D%0A%0D%0AIn his book 'Anjam e Atham', Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani had expressed his%0D%0Adetermination that he would never address the Ulema in future. He was%0D%0Aadamant. Note his vehement style:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"We have today finalised the preachings which were obligatory on us.. and it%0D%0Ais our resolve that we shall not address the Ulema after these%0D%0Aclarifications.. and that is the end of discourses from our side\".%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen Mirza Qadiani had conclusively proclaimed in 1897 his refusal to reopen%0D%0Aany discourse with the Ulema in future, does his promise which according to%0D%0Ayour belief was:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"And he does not speak from inclination of his self; This is but revelation%0D%0Asent down\".%0D%0A%0D%0Astand abrogated or is it that Mirza's progeny does not care a fig for all%0D%0Athose promises, deeds and words which Mirza put forth?%0D%0A%0D%0AMIRZA GHULAM AHMAD QADIANI-- LIAR, APOSTATE, DUALIST-INFIDEL%0D%0AYou have challenged the Ulema of the Ummat for a Mubahala. Remember, such%0D%0Aengagements are final touchstones which distinguish between right and wrong,%0D%0Atruth and falsehood. You seem to be going in for this Mubahala because you%0D%0Aare not sure of the truthfulness of your Sire, even after a lapse of one%0D%0Acentury. Evidently you and your party members distrust your Patriarch.%0D%0A%0D%0APraise be to Allah, the entire Islamic Ummah including myself - the most%0D%0Aincompetent man of Ummat - don't have least of the least doubt that Mirza%0D%0AGhulam Ahmad Qadiani was a liar. Final, decisive and unanimous is Islamic%0D%0AUmmah in the belief that after Allah's Prophet any claimant to prophethood,%0D%0Ais a liar, apostate and dualist-infidel. This is in accordance with th%0D%0AProphetic words:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"Thirty liars (will appear before the Day of Judgement) and each one of them%0D%0Awill claim to be a Prophet of Allah.\" (Tirmizi)%0D%0A%0D%0AMirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani is included in this list.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe statement that \"Mirza's marriage was solemnised in the sky!\" is one%0D%0Aexample of Mirza's falsehood. Allah the Exalted, Supreme in Perfection,%0D%0AEminent in Wisdom, has provided us numerous conclusive proofs of the%0D%0Afalsehood of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani--the Musailma of the Punjab. The%0D%0Alies of this liar are as visible as the sun at meridian. In the context of%0D%0Athese lies, the arch Liar cannot remain hidden from those whose hearts glow%0D%0Awith the light of Faith, however faint. But those eyes which are totally%0D%0Asealed, Allah has been pleased to say about them:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"And the person who shall be blind in this world shall be blind in the%0D%0Ahereafter also and will be strayed more from the path\".%0D%0A%0D%0AHow can a blind man tell the truth from the untruth or distinguish the white%0D%0Afrom the black? Let this one example suffice for Mirza's falsehood.%0D%0A%0D%0AMARRIAGE WITH MUHAMMADI BEGUM IN THE SKY!%0D%0AMirza declared the so-called revelation that he had been married with%0D%0AMuhammadi Begum, a respectable lady, in the sky. He kept on harping on this%0D%0Arevelation of marriage from 1888 to 1907. Ultimately he wrote these words in%0D%0Ahis Appendix to Anjam e Atham on page 54.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"Remember, if the second part of this predication does not come true (i.e.%0D%0AMuhammadi Begum is not married to Mirza after her widowhood), I should be%0D%0Adeemed more wicked than any wicked man. O idiots! this is not a human's%0D%0Apretension. This is no business of any depraved impostor. Consider this to%0D%0Abe God's true promise, definitely the same God Almighty Whose words are%0D%0Anever withdrawn; the same Glorious Nourisher Whose intentions nobody can%0D%0Astop\".%0D%0A%0D%0ACertainly we agree and do believe that Allah's words are His Will. His%0D%0Apromises are true, unbreakable and uncontradictary, unflinching and%0D%0Aunswerving. Nobody can stop His intents.%0D%0A%0D%0AMIRZA DID NOT EVEN SEEN THE SHADOW OF HIS ILLUSIVE BRIDE%0D%0ABut what happened to the second part of Mirza's prediction? Far from%0D%0Amarriage, Mirza did not see even the shadow of his illusive bride, Muhammadi%0D%0ABegum. Is the falsehood of foul and fraudulent Mirza not proved thus? He%0D%0Ahimself admitted in his own words that he was a very wicked man, more wicked%0D%0Athan any other wicked. Jews, Christians, Hindus, Sikhs, cobblers, sweepers,%0D%0Aetc., are also non-Muslims but Mirza admits he is worse than all of them.%0D%0A%0D%0ADoes any doubt still remain of his being an Arch Liar, an impostor, a%0D%0Apretender, nay, the worst of them all? This is one example I have mentioned,%0D%0Aotherwise, Allah the Exalted, has provided us with a collection of proofs%0D%0Anot in hundreds but in thousands.%0D%0A%0D%0AMIRZA ALREADY VANQUISHED IN SEVERAL MUBAHALAS%0D%0A%0D%0ABesides these testimonies, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani had already conducted%0D%0Aa number of Mubahalas with the people. The result invariably was that Allah,%0D%0Athe Exalted, showed him up as the Arch-Liar.%0D%0A%0D%0AINTERESTING SESSION WITH A CHRISITAN PRIEST%0D%0AMirza Qadiani convened a discussion with a local head of episcopal diocese,%0D%0Anamed Atham. For fifteen days argumentation continued. When he could not%0D%0Abeat his adversary he invoked Allah for decision. He pronounced that Allah%0D%0Ahad made this decision for Atham that this liar should be thrown into%0D%0A'Havia' (hell) within fifteen months from June 5, 1893. Mirza had predicted%0D%0Ain these words:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"BLACKEN MY FACE: PUT ROPE AROUND MY NECK\":%0D%0A%0D%0A\"I admit right now that if this prediction goes false, i.e., if within%0D%0Afifteen months from this day, the party who is deemed to be false in Allah's%0D%0Aview does not fall into 'Havia' as death punishment then I am prepared to%0D%0Aundergo every type of punishment: disgrace me, blacken my face, collar a%0D%0Arope around my neck or hang me on the gallows. I am prepared for all. I%0D%0Aswear by the Greatness of Allah that He will certainly do the same, will%0D%0Acertainly do the same, will certainly do the same. The earth and the sky may%0D%0Adeviate but not His Ordainments. If I am a liar keep the gallows ready for%0D%0Ame and consider me the most accursed of all the accursed persons, the%0D%0Aevil-doers and the satans\". (From Jung e Muqaddas, p.189).%0D%0A%0D%0AHULLABALOO IN QADIAN ON THE CRITICAL NIGHT%0D%0AThe night before the avowed date-line, the town of Qadian went into a%0D%0Atumultuous drone. Men, women, big and small rubbed their noses on the earth,%0D%0Alamenting: Ya Allah, Atham may die! Ya Allah, Atham be dead! Ya Allah Atham%0D%0Amay die! They were certain that Atham would no more live to see the light of%0D%0Athe fixed day. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani, on his part, worked out spells of%0D%0Amagic for Atham's death and had charms recited over black grams and thrown%0D%0Athem into dry wells. Despite all these invocations, contrivances and%0D%0Aholloas, Atham remained alive and lived on and on. By His actions Allah. the%0D%0AExalted testified that:%0D%0A%0D%0A*the prediction was not a revelation from Allah;%0D%0A*the prediction was Mirza's imposture;%0D%0A*both Mirza & Atham were liars but Mirza was the Arch Liar;%0D%0A*Mirza deserved the punishment he had proposed on himself, that is \"Disgrace%0D%0Ame\"; \"Blacken my face\"; \"Collar a rope around my neck;\" \"Hang me on the%0D%0Agallows\"%0D%0A%0D%0AAfter this Divine Decision, is there any further need, Mirza Tahir! for the%0D%0AMubahala you wish to hold?%0D%0A%0D%0Ab. WITH MAULANA GHAZNAVI%0D%0AOn the 10th Zeeqada, 1310 Hijri, Mirza Qadiani, by appointment with Hazrat%0D%0AMaulana Abdul Haq Ghaznavi came out in the Eidgah of Amritsar for Mubahala.%0D%0AThe invoked curses told upon Mirza and as a result he tumbled out of life%0D%0Awith his heels twirling and his legs twining, whereas, the celebrated%0D%0AMaulana Sahib lived on respectably, sound and magnificent. Is any Divine%0D%0Atestimony still needed to prove that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was in the wrong!%0D%0A%0D%0Ac. MUBAHALA WITH MAULANA SANAULLAH%0D%0AOn April 15, 1907, Mirza Qadiani published all announcement for holding his%0D%0Afavourite \"Curses Rendezvous\" of Mubahala. His announcement was published in%0D%0Athe form of an advertisement the title %7Eof which was:%0D%0A%0D%0A'FINAL DECISION WITH MAULVI SANAULLAH AMRITSARI'%0D%0A%0D%0AIn this announcement, he beseeched Allah with extreme earnestness and%0D%0Aimplored most humbly. The invocation on his lips: \"Take away the life of%0D%0Awhosoever is the Liar during the life-time of the one who is not. Let the%0D%0Adeath of the liar not be caused by any human hand but by a fatal disease%0D%0Asuch as Cholera. Plague or the like\".%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the advertisement he addressed Maulana Sanaullah Sahib in these words:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"In your paper, you have built up this reputation for me that this person is%0D%0Aa pretender, a liar and 'Dajjal' (the one-eyed anti-Christ impostor). I have%0D%0Aborne a lot of tortures from you, still I endured them patiently.. If I am a%0D%0Aliar and impostor, as you call me in your paper, then I should perish in%0D%0Ayour life-time because, I know, liars and mischief-mongers do not live long.%0D%0AThe liar ultimately meets his doom in a state of intense grief and%0D%0Acontemptuousness, in front of his foe. It is better he perishes lest he%0D%0Ashould mislead Allah's creatures\".%0D%0A%0D%0A\"If I am not a liar or pretender;%0D%0A\"if Allah blesses me by holding dialogues with me;%0D%0A\"if I am the promised Messiah\";%0D%0A\"then by Allah's Munificence, according to His Practice, I hope that you%0D%0Awill not be able to save yourself from His punishment, which He inflicts on%0D%0Adisowning liars.%0D%0A\"Therefore if that punishment, which is not in the hands of a human being%0D%0Abut only in Allah's hands, such as Plague, Cholera and similar fatal%0D%0Adisease, does not descend upon you in my life-time, then I am not God-sent.%0D%0AThis prediction is not because of any revelation or inspiration; it's merely%0D%0Aa prayer I have invoked to Allah for His Decision\".%0D%0A%0D%0AAt the end of this advertisement, Mirza Qadiani wrote:%0D%0A\"Ultimately, my request to Maulvi Sahib is that he should publish this%0D%0Aentire writing of mine in his paper and write underneath whatever he wants%0D%0Abecause now the decision rests with Allah\".%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE FINALE%0D%0AThe decision came out soon, in front of all. Mirza was hale and hearty by 10%0D%0Ao'clock at night on May 25, 1908. He had already taken his dinner. At 10%0D%0Ap.m. Allah's cudgel of punishment suddenly fell on him. He lay victimised by%0D%0ACholera, the same Cholera he had invoked for others. Filth oozed out from%0D%0Aboth of his body orifices. Soon he lost his speech and within twelve hours%0D%0Alay dead. That was May 26, 1908. On the other hand, Maulana Sanaullah%0D%0AAmritsari lived for full forty-one years after Mirza's death and the Maulana%0D%0Adeparted into Allah's Mercy and Grace in 1949. That came about after the%0D%0Aestablishment of Pakistan. He was united with Allah at Sargodha. May Allah%0D%0Agrant him ample compassion.%0D%0A%0D%0AMIRZA--SATANS COMMISSIONER%0D%0AIn view of this decision and in Mirza's circumstantial death, there is all%0D%0Athe proof of his being a great pretender and an arch-liar. Neither was he%0D%0Athe promised Messiah nor was he commissioned by Allah. It was Satan who had%0D%0Acommissioned him.%0D%0A%0D%0AMirza Tahir Sahib! Is there any further need now for a Mubahala after this%0D%0ADivine Decision?%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad Yusuf Ludhianwi%0D%0A"
