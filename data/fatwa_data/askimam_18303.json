  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nasalamualaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatu.\n\nMy name is Omar and i have a question about the dreams i am having these days.  For the past weeks i have religious dreams which i end up crying in every dream i have.  Ive been having dreams from my house.  mostly i am in my garage and the garage is open,  and out of no where there is clear water in the garage as if there is a flud. but the water is a clear and fresh water.  Then i either see the Shahada, or last night which i closed the door, and wen i opened the door the next (dream) its a fresh day, the sky is as blue as it could get, the grass is a fresh green, and i see in the blue cloudless sky. written in 3 times allah(swt) and at the end it said qader. then i cried. what could this mean? i want to know what this means.\n\nThank you\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThe Shahadah in the first dream reflects your subservience to Allah Ta’ala and in the subsequent dream is a reflection of your faith and Ieman.\n\nThe meaning of Qadr means Taqdeer (Faith in Allah). Our Aqeedah and belief with regards to Taqdeer, is that every good and bad which afflicts a believer is from the side of Allah Ta’ala and Allah Ta’ala has knowledge of these occurrences from before.\n\n\nOne should submit fully to Taqdeer and accept every decree of Allah Ta’ala.                                            \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
