  "answer": "QUESTION\nwife has three but wants no more.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ: Are contraceptions permissible?%0D%0AA: Contraception (Azl) is permissible on a limited scale for valid reasons - reasons considered by the Shari%E1h to be valid. The circumstances which will permit reversible and permanent contraception differ.%0D%0AReversible contraception: Among the reasons accepted by the Shari%E1h as valid for practising reversible contraception are: a) Physical weakness.b) Sickness.c) The wife maintaining her beauty or figure for the sake of her husband. d) The couple being on a journey or in a distant land. e) Adverse political conditions, e.g. children are forcibly separated from their parents as is advocated by communism; etc. f) The couple decide to separate in the near future. g) The wife is an immoral person.%0D%0AThere are valid grounds for practising reversible contraception. Poverty or the fear of poverty are not valid reasons for contraception. It is not permissible to practice contraception on account of a fear of not being able to provide for a large family. Such a fear is an attribute of non-Muslims.%0D%0AAccording to the Qur%E3n Shareef: ?There is not a living creature, but its sustenance is the responsibility of Allah.? Similarly desire to curb sexual desire which may stem out of piety is not a lawful ground for contraception. If practised for any reason which is unlawful in Islam, then contraception will likewise be unlawful, e.g. for indulgence in illicit sex.%0D%0APermanent contraception is permissible only if the woman?s life is in danger or her health is seriously threatened.%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Sa%E9ed Khudhry (RA) reports that one person asked Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) about Azal (Coitus Interruptus). Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) replied, ?When Allah Ta%E3la intends creating a child, nothing can stop him.?
