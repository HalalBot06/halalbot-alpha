  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know the ruling on celebrating our Nabies birthday. since a Muslim friend of mine told me that we are not suppose to celebrate the Nabies birthday, we are suppose to only remember it since we are not suppose to celebrate birthdays.  \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMany people repeatedly ask what is the Sharée status of \"Éid-e-Meelad-un-Nabee'. Moreover, What is the ruling of the Shariáh with regard to standing up in reverence and reciting Salaat and salaam during the customary Meelad proceedings?\n\nAnswer: The establishment of ceremonial gatherings under the banner of \"Éid-un-Nabee\" is prohibited according to the Shariáh. Attaching importance and significance to such functions is purely Bidáh and an innovation in Deen, because neither did Rasulullah himself indulge in it, nor did the illustrious Khulafaa-e-Raashideen (Radhiyallaahu-Ánhum) organise such functions. Similarly, neither did any of the other Sahaaba-e-Kiraam (Radhiyallaahu-Ánhum) participate in such gatherings, nor is there any incident on record during the blessed era of the taabi'een or tab'e taabi'een (Rahmatullaahi Álayhim) that can, in any way, substantiate this innovation. No proof whatsoever can be found, in spite of the fact that these were people who were best acquainted with the Sunnah of Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam) and had total love for him. They were staunch followers of the Shariáh.\n\nRasulullah (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam) has in no unclear terms, said: - \"whoever introduces anything that is not part of Deen, into this Deen of ours, it shall be rejected.\" (Bukhari/Muslim)\n\nIn another Hadith he says: - \"Hold steadfast onto my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly-guided Khulafaa, after me. Hold steadfast onto it firmly, and beware of newly-introduced practices, for every new practice is an innovation and every innovation leads one astray.\" (Abu Dawood/Tirmizi)\n\nSevere warnings have been sounded in the above-mentioned Ahaadith with regard to introducing and implementing innovations in Deen. The holy Qur'an enjoins: - \"And whatsoever the messenger giveth you, take it. And whatsoever he forbiddeth, abstain (from it). And keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is stern in reprisal.\" (59:7)\n\n\"Verily in the messenger of Allah, ye have a good example for him who looketh unto Allah and the last day, and remembereth Allah much.\" (33:21)\n\n\"This day have I perfected your religion for you and completed my favour unto you, and have chosen for you a religion, al-Islam.\" (5:3)\n\nThere are numerous other Aayaat and Ahaadith that can be quoted. But from no Aayat or Ahaadith can the current form of \"Eid-e-Meelad-un-Nabee (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam)', be proved. In spite of this, the people that revel in establishing and participating in such functions, and regard the same as a form of reward, insist on forging ahead with their carnal ideals. This attitude of theirs causes some serious questions to be posed: -\n\nDid Allah Ta'ala not perfect Deen-e-Islam for this Ummah?\n\nDid Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam) not disclose to us all the facets and aspects of Islam that required being put into practice?\n\nThe bitter truth for the exponents of Bid'a is that it was only many centuries after the righteous and golden era of Islam that people began to fabricate innovations under the h00d of \"Éid-e-Meelad-un-Nabee (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam)\" and \"Mahfeel-e-Meelad\", which were, practices not ordained by Allah Taãla to any of His Ambiyaa Álayhimus salaam.\n\nWill such innovations grant proximity to Allah Taãla? Never! On the contrary, these innovations should be a cause of great concern and alarm for the Ummat-e-Muslimah! Na-oothu-billahi-min-thalika! We seek Allah Taãla's refuge from innovations that tantamount to levelling mind-boggling accusations against the pure and venerable personality of Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam) by innovating such practices, one is indirectly suggesting that Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam) concealed from the Ummah, aspects of Deen that were of immense benefit t0  it. How can this be possible when Allah Ta'ala himself categorically declares that he perfected this religion for us and completed his favour upon us, which means that Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam) conveyed every single aspect of Deen to the Ummah and that he left no stone unturned in showing us every road leads t0 Jannah and every road that takes one to Jahannam so that we may adopt the former and avoid the latter.\n\nHence, it is mentioned in one Hadith: - \"It was the incumbent duty of every Nabee Álayhis-salaam to guide his Ummah towards that which was beneficial for it and warn it against that which was detrimental for it.\" (Muslim)\n\nIt is a known fact that Rasulullah is the most superior of all the Ambiyaa Álaihimus-salaam and also that he is the seal of all the prophets Álayhimus-salaam. He left no stone unturned in conveying Deen to us and rendering precious advice to us. If the \"Éid-e-Meelad-un-Nabee (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam)\" was a divinely inspired act, then surely Rasulullah would have commanded the Muslimeen to it, or at least, either he or his beloved Sahaaba (Radhiyallahu-Ánhum) would have practised it. When it cannot be substantiated by any of their actions, then it is a crystal clear fact \"Éid-e-Meelad-un-Nabee (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam)\" or \"Mahfeel-e-Meelad\" (call it what you may), has absolutely no relationship with Islam instead, it is Bidáh (innovation) against which we have been soundly warned by Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam) as was noted from the tw0 Ahaadith mentioned at the beginning of this discussion and, apart from them, many more can be quoted to prove the fallacy of innovation in Islam. That is why, in the light of these unambiguous proofs, the Úlama-e-Haqq have always refuted and rejected the customary form of \"Éid-e-Meelad-un-Nabee.(Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam)\" and Mahfeel-e-Meelad and have also always discouraged people from participating in such gatherings.\n\nIf a careful and proper dissection of this \"Éid-e-Meelad-un-Nabee (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam)\" is made, it will be found that, apart from it being a manifestation of Bid'at, it also encompasses 0ther evils such as the intermingling of sexes, usage of musical instruments and many other such evils which wildly flaunted under the banner of \"Éid-e-Meelad-un-Nabee (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam)\" and under the deception that reward is being accrued. The most abhorring and shocking evils in these functions are the acts of shirk that take place. With hollow claims of \"Hubbe-Rasul (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam)\" (love for Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam)), entreaties and supplications are made to beings other than Allah, namely to Ambiyaa Álaihimus-salaam and Auliaa-e-Kiraam Rahmatullaahi-Álaaihum. The exponents of \"Éid-e-Meelad-un-Nabee (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam)\" also blindly acknowledge and believe that Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam) comes to this function and due to this belief, they stand up in respect and veneration to welcome him. This belief is a blatant fabrication and a sign of compound ignorance. The true and down t0 earth fact is that Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam) does not arrive at any \"Éid-e-Meelad-un Nabee (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam)\" function and that he is in his Rawdha-e-Mubarak (grave) at Madinah Munawwarah and will emerge from it at the onset of Yawmul-Qiyaamah.\n\nThe following Aayaat and Hadith testify to this fact: -\n\nThe Qur'an, addressing Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam), announces explicitly: - \"Lo! Thou wilt die, and Lo! They will die. Then Lo! On the day of resurrecti0n, before your sustainer, you will dispute.\" (39:30,31)\n\nAt another juncture, Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam) is addressed together with the rest of mankind: - \"Then Lo! After that ye surely die, then Lo! On the day of resurrection ye are raised (again)\" (23:16)\n\nRasulullah (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam) himself has said in a Hadith: - \"My grave will be the first to be opened on the day of Qiyaamah and I shall be the first person to intercede and the first person whose intercession shall be accepted.\"\n\nThe above mentioned Aayaat and Hadith as well as other similar Aayaat and Ahaadith prove that all of mankind will be raised from their graves on the day of Qiyaamah, with Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam) being no excepti0n. This is a belief that revolves around the consensus of opinion of the entire Ummat-e-Muslimah, hence the need for all Muslims to believe that Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam) is in his Rawdha-e-Mubarak and does not frequent any \"Éid-e-Meelad-un-Nabee (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam)\" programme. All Muslims must be made aware of this so that unsuspecting ones do not fall prey to the Bid'at and innovations introduced into Deen by ignoramuses of this Ummah.\n\nWe make Duáa to Allah Ta'ala that he keeps us on the correct Deen-ul-Islam and that he gives guidance to those that goes astray. May Allah Ta'ala's Durood and salaam descend upon Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam).\n\nThe Importance of Durood and Salaam\n\nInstead of squandering our money and time on futile acts 0f Bidáh let us rather utilise our precious time, as much as possible on the recitation of Durood and salaam upon our beloved Rasulullah, which is indeed, a highly meritorious and virtuous act. The Qur'an enjoins: - \"Lo! Allah and his Malaaikah shower blessings on the Nabee 0 ye who believe ask for the descent of blessings on him and salute him with a worthy salutation.\" (34:56)\n\nRasulullah (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam) has said: - \"Whosoever sends one Durood upon me, Allah Ta'ala will shower ten mercies upon him.\" (Muslim)\n\nParticularly on the day of Jumuáh one should increase the recitation of Durood and salaam. May Allah Taãla give us the guidance to recite Durood abundantly and grant us 'Hubbe-Rasul (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam)\" in the true sense of the word.\n\nWarning to Úlama\n\nHadhrat Muádh bin Jabal (Radhiyallaahu Ánhu) narrates the following Hadith, 'Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, 'whenever a Bidáh originates in my Ummah and the Úlama do not prevent it, the laánat of Allah, of his angels and of mankind descend upon them (the Úlama who refrain from prohibiting the innovation).'
