  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf Allah is Hazer and Nazer everywhere, then why rassulallah was taken to Skies above on the night of Maraj, to meet Allah subhanuo talla.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah being Haazir (Omnipresent) everywhere and Naazir (seeing) everything does not mean that He is physically present everywhere.\n\nThe terms refer to the absolute knowledge of Allah. His knowledge encompasses everything and nothing is hidden from the perfect knowledge of Allah. Allah is as Allah explains Himself ? on the throne. However, the reality of Allah being on the throne is best known only to Him.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
