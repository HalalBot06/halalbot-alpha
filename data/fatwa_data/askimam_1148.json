The area immediately under the navel is not to be shaven.\nThe area of shaving for a person (male / female) is above and around the private parts. If possible, it is commendable to shave around the hind private parts as well. (Al-Kaamil, commentary of Muslim; Imaam Nawawi vol. 1 pg. 128).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nAll forms of Insurance are not permissible since these companies are based on Interest and gambling.\n\nThe Noble Qur√£n says, ''O` You who believe!! Verily intoxicants, gambling and the casting of arrows for luck are filth from the works of Shaitaan. So avoid all this so that you may attain success. (Qur'an 5:90)\n\n'O` You who believe, fear Allah and leave out that which remains from Riba (Interest), if you are believers. And if you do not, then take notice of war from Allah and His Rasool. (Qur'an 2:279)"
