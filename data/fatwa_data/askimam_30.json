  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nToday, it is Raf-ul-Yadayn, tomorrow it could be Ameen bil Jahr or Sirr and\nfollowing some other differences. Therefore, in the interest of the\ncommunity at large, we suggest you continue with the necessary Da√°wah work\nand propagate the faith at all times.\n\nWith regard to the Salafis, the discussion should not be on making\nRaf-ul-uadayn or not, but making Taqleed of a specific Imaam. Kindly refer\nto our article on Taqleed: http://www.jamiat.org.za/taqleed.html\n\nWe suggest you obtain the book, 'The Question of Raf-ul-Yadain' by As-saadiq\nPublications, P.O.
