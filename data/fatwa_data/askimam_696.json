  "question": "Is interest money Halal for Muslims?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhile answering one question you have mentioned that interest money can be given to poor and needy. I would like you to please check the instructions regarding interest money in Qur'an and Hadith and I am Inshallah sure you are totally wrong in your answer.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nInterest is strictly prohibited as expressly mentioned in the Qur'aan and Ahaadith.\n\nHowever, if one uses the bank facility to keep his money, he will receive interest. That amount should be disposed off by giving it away to the poor and needy.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
