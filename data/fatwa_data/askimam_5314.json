  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam Alaikum. I would like to know the interpreataion of a dream I had sometime ago. In my dream, i saw myself inside a masjid. And then i see the doors of the masjid open from inside and a parade of people walk in. Amongst them I saw their leader, he was a bearded man with a smile on his face. He looked very brave and courages and had broad shoulders. The people in the masjid (amongst whom i was as well), greeted the leader and his people with lots of respect and gratitude. At the end of the dream, i strongly felt that the bearded leader was the second Khalifa of Islam, Omar (RA). Could that person really be him? And what does this dream mean?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is possible.\n\nYour meeting with Hadhrat Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) is a blessing to you.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
