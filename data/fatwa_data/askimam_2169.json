  "answer": "QUESTION\nDuring menopause generally a female's monthly cycle of bleeding is suppressed resulting in her experiencing hot flushes and other medical complications. Her physician prescribes HRT (hormone replacement tablets) in order to enhance her monthly cycle which gives her relief. Will the enhanced bleeding be regarded as Haydh?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe enhanced bleeding by HRT (hormone replacement tablets) will be\nregarded as Haydh. (Shaami vol.1 pg.222; Rashidiyya)\nThe same ruling applies for a female who attained the age of despair\n(Sinne-Iyaas) of 50 years. During Haydh (menstruation), a female cannot\nperform Salaat, fast, recite and touch the Qur'aan and make Tawaaf.\n\nFrom: Al Mahmood 13 Q & A from the Darul Ifta\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
