  "question": "is it permissible to enter a competition where you have to buy a ticket?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nis it permissible to enter a competition where you have to buy a ticket?\n\nwhat about competitions where you enter after having bought goods from a store?\n\ni recall that Cii had a competition that the resident Mufti Saheb said it is permissible to enter, as the (competition) goods were sponsored by someone. kindly comment.\n\nwhat about winning some goods after having bought something, without your knowledge of entering any competition?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is not permissible to buy a ticket specifically to enter a competition. That is gambling. It is permissible to be part of a competition after purchasing goods from a store. In this instance, one is not paying specifically to enter the competition. I do not know the details about the Cii competition.\n\nIf one did not pay a fee to enter the competition, the prize will be permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
