  "question": "Parents forcing into marriage",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsslaam alaikum, I?m in a predicament I?m 17 years old my parents want me to marry my cousin I don?t want to. I simply decline because I know I'm too young and immature and because I want a religious man not an irreligious man. I can decline cant I? And if I find my self married to him against my will, the marriage isn?t legal in Islam is it? Does that mean that I would be committing fornication? How much of a say do my parents have in my marriage? Does my happiness mean more than theirs as I will be married to the guy eternally have his kids and sleep with him? I DON?T WANT TO MARRY HIM. Thank you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, since you have reached the age of puberty, you are an adult\nand have the independent right to choose your marriage partner.\n\nHowever, in\ndoing so, you should consider the advise and guidance of your parents.\n\nBy virtue of their love and concern for you, they will consider your\ninterest. We advise that you and your parents adopt the procedure of\nIstikhaara (seek divine guidance) and Mashwarah (mutual consultation) in\nmaking a decision. Somewhere on this site, search 'istikhaara' (without\nquotes)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
