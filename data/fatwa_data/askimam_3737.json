  "question": "IF a person who has cursed another dies, how will the person who has been cursed repent or ask forgiveness from the deceased?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'If a cursed person is not\nfit for the curse, then the curse goes back to the curser.' (Mishkaat)\n\nTherefore, if the cursed person committed any wrong to the curser and he\n(the curser) passed away, then he should rectify that. If he owes anything\nintangible, then he should perform a virtuous act and give the reward to the\ndeceased. If the cursed person did not do any wrong, then the burden of the\ncurse is upon the curser. If the curser passed away, seek forgiveness on\nhis/her behalf. Insha Allah, there will be great reward for that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
