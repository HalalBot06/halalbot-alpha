  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n we have been blessed with a baby son, who we have to name now.   Kindly comment on the appropriateness of the name 'Labib' for the child.  Is this a standalone name, or do we have to add one of the attributes of Allah (SWT) with the name such as Labib-Ul-Huq or Labib-Ur-Rahman, etc.   By the way, if i were to add my name 'Maudud' as father's name with that of the child, does the name Labib Maudud Choudhury make any sense?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe name Labib is an appropriate Muslim name. It means an intelligent person. The name would be a stand alone name. It could have the name Muhammed before it or Ul Haq/Ur Rahman after it. The father’s name Maudud suits well with the name Labib.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
