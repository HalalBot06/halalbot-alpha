  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to Shari'a, a Muslim male may have four wives simultaneously with\nthe condition of maintaining equality among all his wives. Therefore, in\nprinciple, you can remarry without divorcing your wife.\n\nHowever, in order to avoid bitter feelings to your present wife, you should\nfirst discuss your intentions of remarrying with wisdom. That will save you\nfrom the negative consequences fo betrayal, etc. being possibly expressed by\nher upon her discovering your secret remarriage.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
