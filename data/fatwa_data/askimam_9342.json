  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. I am 15 and not gay but I keep getting thoughts throughout the whole day of Satan trying to confuse me into being gay. When I see a man I keep thinking of Shayton trying to confuse me. It gets really anoying and i am not happy. If i try to do something to get my mind off of it by doing something it really dosent work, i just think about satan trying to confuse me when I am doing the activity or whatever. I pray 5 times a day and try to follow the requirements. This makes me very unhappy and deppressed, I pray that I forget these thoughts but they keep coming back, is it maybe paranoia and if so how can I get rid of that, can you please tell me what to do to get rid of these thoughts.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPray two Rakaats of Salaatul Haajat and beg Allah to deliver you from this predicament. Also, control your gaze and avoid staring at people whom you feel will augment the problem.\n\nInstead of trying to eliminate such evil thoughts, try focusing your mind upon something positive. Draw your mind away by thinking about something else. Shaytaani thoughts are like a live-wire; the more you try to drive it away the more it will harm you.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
