  "question": "Are there any Sahabas (RA) mentioned by name/title in Quran? Is there any thing in Quran regarding the greatness of Sahabas (RA)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI heard that there are 17 things that Omer RA wanted to do and Allah made those things Shariat (Law). Some of those things are; Parda (Hijab), Idhan, not praying for munafiq, and at one time killing disbelieves. Is it true? If it is what are those 17 things? JazakAllah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There are no Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) mentioned specifically by name%0D%0Ain the Qur'aan besides Hadhrat Zayd ibn Haarith (Radhiallaahu Anhu)%0D%0Apertaining to a lengthy incident. (Surah 33 Aayat 37).%0D%0AThere are many verses regarding the virtues of the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhum) in general. The meaning of one such comprehensive verse is, 'The%0D%0Afirst to lead the way from the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar and those who%0D%0Afollowed them in goodness. Allah is well pleased with them and they are well%0D%0Apleased with Him and Allah has made ready for them gardens underneath which%0D%0Arivers flow wherein they will abide forever. That is the supreme triumph.'%0D%0A(Surah9 verse 100)%0D%0AIn this verse, Allah Ta'ala announces that He is well pleased with the%0D%0ASahaaba and that they too are well pleased with Him. Allah Ta'ala has%0D%0Aguaranteed them all Jannat.%0D%0A2. There are fifteen things which Allah Ta'ala made Shari'ah (law) in%0D%0Aaccordance to the opinion of Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu). Thirteen of which are%0D%0Averses which Allah Ta'ala revealed in the Qur'aan and the remaining two in%0D%0Athe Tawraat. The thirteen in the Qur'aan are:%0D%0Aa. To perform Salaat behind the Maqaam-e-Ibraahim (Surah 1 verse 125).%0D%0Ab. The women should don the Hijaab (Surah 33 Aayat 67)%0D%0Ac. The prisoners of war in the battle of Badr should be killed (Surah 8%0D%0Averse 67)%0D%0Ad. The incident in which Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) advised the wives of Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) not to cause him (Nabi) any inconvenience%0D%0A(Surah 66 Aayat 5)%0D%0Ae. In the same incident, when the prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) went%0D%0Ainto seclusion, then Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) consoled the prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) by saying, 'Allah is with you, Jibraaeel%0D%0A(Alayhis salaam), myself, Abu Bakr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) and the believers are%0D%0Aall with you.' Allah Ta'ala revealed a verse accordingly. (Surah 66 verse4)%0D%0Af. Not to perform Janaaza Salaat for the hypocrites (Surah 9 Aayat 84)%0D%0Ag. Not to seek forgiveness for the hypocrites (Surah 63 Aayat 6)%0D%0Ah. The praises of Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) for Allah Ta'ala about how he%0D%0Acreated man through different stages (Surah 23 Aayat 14)%0D%0Ai. The incident of Ifk - Allah Ta'ala revealed a verse showing the freedom%0D%0Aof Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha) in accordance to the statement of Umar%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhu), i.e. 'Glory be to Allah, this is a great slander.'%0D%0A(Surah 24 Aayat 16)%0D%0Aj. The incident in which Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) tells a Jew that if the%0D%0Aqualities of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) are present in their book,%0D%0Awhy will they refuse to accept him. (Surah 2 Aayat 97-98)%0D%0Ak. Prohibition of liquor (Surah 2 Aayat 219)%0D%0Al. Slaves should seek permission to the master's home (Surah 24 aayat 58)%0D%0Am. These verse, 'A large group of people will enter paradise' (Surah 56%0D%0AAayat 40) was revealed after Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) complained to Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) about why only a few people will gain%0D%0Asalvation in the hereafter.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs for the two in the Tawraat, they are:%0D%0Aa) A Jew asked Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu), Allah Ta'ala says in the Qur'aan%0D%0Athat the width of Jannat is as large as the distance between the earth and%0D%0Athe sky, so where is Jahannum? Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) asked the other%0D%0ASahaaba to answer him, to which nobody did. Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) himself%0D%0Areplied, 'When daylight comes, does it not cover the entire atmosphere%0D%0Abetween the earth and the sky?' the Jew said, 'Yes'. Umar (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhu) said, 'Then where is night?' The Jew acknowledged this, took an oath%0D%0Aand said that this is exactly what the Tawraat said.%0D%0Ab) Once a Jew recited a verse from the Tawraat in the presence of Umar%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhu). Thereafter, Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) said to the Jew,%0D%0A'Except he who takes stock of himself.' The Jew took an oath and said that,%0D%0A'O Umar, this statement of yours is found in the same sequence in the%0D%0ATawraat.'
