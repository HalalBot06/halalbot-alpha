  "question": "I have irregular periods, can i pray and fast in this condition?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAOA i have been diagnosed of poly cystic ovaries , a condition in which i have irregular periods sometimes lastings for 6 weeks or 8 my question is can i pray and observe fast in this condition and can i recite HOLY QURAN.\n\nJAZAKALLAH\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nThe maximum time for a period (hayd) is ten days and ten nights and anything more that this is an irregular bleeding (istihādah).  Therefore, if you bled for more than ten days and ten nights in a particular month, then you will consider the number of days for your period last month.  Any days above this number of days will be istihādah, not hayd [i]. \n\n \n\nHowever, if you bleed more than ten days and ten nights every month, then any bleeding above ten days and ten nights will be istihādah. \n\n \n\nDuring istihādah, you may pray, fast, touch and recite the Holy Qur’ān, have marital relations, and do all other acts that a person can do in a state of purity.  However, you will have to make a fresh wudū for each prayer time.  As long as the prayer time lasts, your wudū will last, as well, provided it did not break due to other factors, such as using the bathroom [ii]. \n\n \n\n[i]\n\n(Heavenly Ornament, pg. 88-89; Zam Zam)\n\n \n\n[ii]\n\n(Ibid, pg. 60)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
