  "answer": "QUESTION\nNow a days every qari & in mudarassah they are taking fees for teaching Quran, is it premissible or not..is the fees are halal or haram.2)i found a prepaid mobile card is it ok to use it and gave this miney to begger or mosque.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is permissible for a person teaching Qur?aan to take fees.\n\n2. When a person finds an article, he must search for its owner and announce the lost item. The person should clearly announce that he has found a particular item and that the owner should come and claim it. However, he should not mention exactly what he has found. Instead, he should merely give some vague description of it. Once the claimant comes and gives a clear description, it should be given to him. If the person searches extensively for the owner or advertises it properly and still does not find its owner to such an extent that he has no hope of finding its owner, then he should give that item in charity. If the person is poor himself, he can keep it for his personal use.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
