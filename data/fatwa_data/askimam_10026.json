  "question": "is it harom 2 talk 2 guyz but not religion wise just as friends",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe answer to your question is very straight forward. It is not permissible for males to talk to non mahram (those whom he can marry) females even as friends. The main reason for this is that this is a sure way to fitnah (mischief) occurring. It may start off as a friendship but could lead to various other things.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
