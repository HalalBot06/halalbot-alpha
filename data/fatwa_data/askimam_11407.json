  "question": "When reciting Qiraat during Salaat I started with one Surah, realizing that I had already recited it in the previous Rakaat, switched to a different Surah. Is Sajda-Sauw required?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNo, sajda-e-Sahw is not required in this case.\n\nHowever, one should not do so. After commencing a surah, it should not be abandoned even if it was recited in the previous rakaat. Sajda-e-sahw is not stipulated in this situation as well.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH SCIENCES\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
