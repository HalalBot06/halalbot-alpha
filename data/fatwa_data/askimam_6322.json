  "answer": "QUESTION\nI got a proposal from a guy who is a few months younger to me. So can marriage take place between us? How are we supposed to convince our parents since our society believes that the husband should be older than his wife? Please give some hadeeths Thanks!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn Islam, there is no 'age restriction' for marriage. As long as all the%0D%0Aconditions of Nikah are taken into consideration, the Nikah will be valid.%0D%0AWhen our beloved Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) married Hadhrat Khadija%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anha), she was much more older than him. Similarly, when Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) married Hadhrat Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha), he%0D%0Awas much more older than her.%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom this, we can see that there is no age restriction. However, there must%0D%0Abe equality, suitability or rather compatibility. Both partners must be%0D%0Acompatible. With regards to the material things of this world, they should%0D%0Abe compatible. In things like understanding, intelligence, wealth and%0D%0Amaturity, there should be similarities. It is for this reason that the%0D%0Ajurists have stated that the boy should be a few years older than the girl.%0D%0AHowever, this is not a hard and fast rule. There are always exceptions.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf you are absolutely certain that this boy is the right choice and that%0D%0Aboth of you are compatible, then consult your parents or other senior%0D%0Amembers of your family. Do not worry about what society will say. You%0D%0Aconsult your parents and let him consult his parents, both sides of the%0D%0Afamily should sit down together and discuss and resolve the issue.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
