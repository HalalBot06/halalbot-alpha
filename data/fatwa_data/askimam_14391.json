  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissible for men to go to a common GYM for men and women here in UK where there is no separate facility available just for men exclusively.Please explain in detail.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is Haraam to attend a mix gym where the Satr (private parts) of strange men and women are exposed. Furthermore, the concept of subscribing to gym clubs has become a fashion and a mark of prestige. The original purpose of gymming is to remain fit and healthy. However, nowadays the philosophy of gym has changed. Much concentration is given on slimming and cutting down levels of obesity. Men want to look fit and trim likewise women want to become flexi and inherit fitness accolades and awards. Certainly, the body is an Amaanat (trust) which we have to look after and nurture. However, this must be done within the parameters and boundaries of Shariah. Furthermore, the evils and Fitna that emanates from the change rooms of gyms cannot be fathomed. Experience bears testimony that one of the major causes of break down in marriages is dating and flirting that starts at the gym change rooms.\n\nThis is the plot of Shaytaan and his human allies. They have failed with other forms of diversions and now made sport and recreation an integral part of everyoneâ€™s life. The concept of the gym is such that it makes one oblivious of his surrounds and tempts one to continue punishing himself in the name of physical training. There is no concern for Salaah and the remembrance of Allah is void in that place.\n\nWomen should never consider leaving the home for this purpose. Allah and the angles curse her when she leaves the house. Women may remain fit by installing such equipment within the confines of her home and endeavor never to violate the Laws of Shariah.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
