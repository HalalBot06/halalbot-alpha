  "question": "Would 12:00 noon be regarded as Mid-Day throughout the year? If \"zawal\" is referred to MidDay, would it always occur at 12:00 noon throughout the year?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Sahaab: As-Salaam-O-Alaykum Wa-Rahmaahtullahey-Wa-Baraakataho. I read the answer in response to Question# 2247, posted at your web site. The response still leaves one yearning for more specific details. Please be kind enough to answer the following questions in detail: 1. If \"ZAWAL\" is referred to Mid-Day, would it always occur at 12:00 NOON throughout the year? 2. What is duration of stoppage of SUN's movement during Mid-Day? 3. What is the approximate time during ZAWAL, one should refrain from establishing salaat? For example in our locality, Duhur starts at 12:45 PM during the winter season and at 1:45 PM during the summer. Your answers in light of the teachings of the FOUR schools of thought, to the above listed questions are very much appreciated. Jaza-Allah-O-Khairan, Wa-As-Salaam-O-Alaykum Wa-Rahmaahtullahey-Wa-Baraakatah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Zawaal will not necessarily be at 12:00 noon. It will differ from place\nto place, and from season to season.\n2. Zawaal begins when the shadow of an object ceases to decrease, i.e. it\nhas reached its shortest length. Zawaal ends when the shadow begins to\nincrease. This lasts for approximately 10 minutes.\n3. It is Makrooh to perform Salaat during the entire duration of Zawaal.\nDhuhr may only commence after Zawaal has ended.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
