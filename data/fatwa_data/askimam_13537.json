  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni recentlly got married.i made jewellery for my wife from my last years savings n my wife also brought some jewwllery from her parents home now i want to know should i pay zakat on both jew as i did pay zakat last year on my savings.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to Shariah, your wife will pay Zakaat on the jewellery if one entire lunar year has passed while the jewellery was in her possession. Therefore, from the day you had given her the jewellery you will calculate one lunar year and offer the Zakaat thereafter.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai\nStudent: Darul Ifta\n\nChecked and Approved: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
