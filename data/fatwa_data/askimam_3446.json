  "answer": "QUESTION\nLast night I had a dream as if something was trying to take my imaan out. It felt very evil as it was black and these 3 things were in the form of a very heavy wind. I was reading Ayatul Kursi and sura an-naas even when I got up. It was a struggle in the dream until I started reading.When I awoke from (out of fright) I was breathing very heavy with my whole body beating. Please interpret this dream? Jazaakullah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlhamdulillah, the dream is a sign of your Imaan being strong.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
