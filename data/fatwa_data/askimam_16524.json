Either Halal Or Haram\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nYour work is confined to designing software programs. There is nothing impermissible in that. If the companies use the programs for any un-Islamic activities, you will not be responsible for that. Your salary for designing the program is halal.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
