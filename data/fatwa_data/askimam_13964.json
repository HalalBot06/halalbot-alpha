  "answer": "QUESTION\nI received your response to a query I sent in yesterday. I asked about forged signatures. I hated it when they told me to mail them but they did. That is why I am asking. I'll clarify. It would be the same thing if a scholar friend of  yours responded to a question, and it was the same response you would have  given, but it was by him not you. He then signed \"Mufti Ibrahim Desai\" at the bottom just so the person asking would have full faith in the answer. Please forgive me for this parallel, it just popped in my head and seems to be a clear way of conveying what I meant. My role would be to email that answer to whoever asked, and let's say you pay me for it -- is that money haram? -- forgive me again for the question.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nJazaakumullah for the clarity on the question.\n\nThe assistants may sign the letter on behalf of the tax officials or alternatively copy the signatories of the officials with their consent.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
