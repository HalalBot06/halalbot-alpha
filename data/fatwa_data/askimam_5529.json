  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamoaaikum respected Mufti sahab! Is it true that some aayahs which were revealed by Allah (swt) were told not to be included in the Quran by the Prophet Muhammad (saw)? For example, it is said that previously there was an ayat saying that 'Oh Muslims, do not drink (wine) during prayers'. But later on as alcohol was set haram, then the aayah was obsoleted. Thank you for your invaluable service. 2.I follow the Hanafi madhab. When I pray sunnah in the mosque, Shafai Muslims come and make me the imam without takbir, by just touching me or saying Allah o Akbar. Should I fulfill my responsibilities as an Imam as I am not praying fardh at that time?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) The verse, 'Oh you believe, do not go close to Salaat whilst you are\nintoxicated is abrogated but is in the Qur'aan in Surah al-In'aam.\n2) According to the Shaafi'ee Madhab, it is permissible for a person to\nperform Fardh Salaat behind a person performing Sunnah and Nafl Salaats. If\na Shaafi'ee joins you, you may continue with your Fardh Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
