  "question": "If I have to leave the country Iâ€™m residing in due to refusal of permanent visa, do I still have to pay my debts?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have recently applied for permanent visa, and if my application is rejected I have to go back to my country of origin, where I will be earning 10 times less income. I have significant debts towards the bank through personal loans and credit cards, which I will not be able to pay from my country of origin due to low income. What do you advise me in this situation? What?s the ?tarteep? to follow? I haven?t made mashuara with ma?shaikh because I feel very embarrassed to talk about this to people I know.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShari?ah has emphasised on fulfilling debts. Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] would not perform the Janaaza Salaat of a person who has debts and does not have means to honour the debts.\n\nShari?ah has also emphasised that one should live within his means. It is against the Shari?ah to live beyond one?s means and incur debts for that. You should endervour to fulfil your debts to the bank. If you cannot do that, you should discuss that with the bank, and make arrangements with them. It will not appropriate for you to leave the country and ignore your debt to the bank.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
