My only option is to try to get apporved for another zero% interest card but if I dont am i still being sinned or i am excused since this was done by mistake  unkonwilnngy and by force since allah forgives the sin if its is done by force. what should i do\n\n2. my family does not take the prohibibiotion of lightly they say that we have no choice and the riba in the banks is different from riba in the quran and islamic banking  is different what should i do to convincne them i am worried about them\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1.       Since you applied for the credit card and accepted the impermissible pre-conditions, it cannot be stated that you were forced to pay the interest. Furthermore, whether a person intentionally or carelessly exceeds the credit limit, he or she will have to bear the burden of the consequences. We advise that you repent to Allah for this and resolve never to repeat it.\n\n2.      You should inform your parents that the warnings mentioned in regards to Ribā are the most severe. They should refrain from involving themselves in interest. Furthermore, they definitely have a choice in refraining from the evil of Ribā, they merely find it more convenient to purchase items in installments with the precondition of interest. Many times people purchase items with interest payments for which they have no dire need. There is no scope and laxity in this regard and they should refrain from such actions immediately. You should wisely advise them against their habits. In regards to their claim of there being a difference between the interest of today and that of the Qur'ān, they are mistaken if they assume that in some way the sin of modern interest is overlooked or lightened in the least. Many people who wish to condone their wrongs use the flimsiest of excuses to justify themselves. However, this mentality and practice is extremely dangerous and at times could lead a person towards disbelief. If a person carries out a sin with the belief that it is a sin, he or she will be given the courage and ability to forsake the sin someday. However, if a person tries to justify his or her wrongs, he or she will never repent from that sin.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nMl.
