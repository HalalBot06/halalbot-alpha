  "answer": "QUESTION\nFirst, what is the maximum number of Rakaats you can pray at a time. I usually get up for Tahajjud, I know the Sunnah is 13 Rakaats. But can I pray like 50 to 100 Rakaats at a time? Second Question:- I fell in love with a non-Muslim. I never beleived in love before, but now I am in this situation. I really don't know what to do. I would have married her by now if she was Muslim. The only reason why we can't do it because of the relegious beleifs. I know its really hard for us to be together in this world. But can I ask Allah Subhana Ta'Allah to give me her in Jannah? I love her alot, and that is why I am asking my Allah for this. He is the only One whom I can ask. Is there any harm in that? May Allah reward you for that. And only Allah knows how much I love her and respect her. Ever since I saw her, my Imaan got stronger and stronger.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There is no limit to the amount of Rakaats performed during the nights. However, it was the beloved practice of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) to perform 10 Rakaats of Tahajjud and 3 Rakaats of Witr during the night. Therefore, you may perform any amount of Rakaats during the night. (Dars-e-Tirmidhi vol.2 pg.200; Karachi)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. At the outset, we wish to bring to your attention that a non-Muslim who passes away in that condition will never enter Jannah. Nevertheless, we suggest you consider the following: a) How can I love a person who has ascribed partner with my Sustainer, Nourisher and Creator, b) Is her love for me eternal or temporary, c) Can I compare her beauty, character, etc. with the beauty and character of the maidens of Jannah which Allah promises and describes in the Qur?aan?%0D%0A%0D%0AAfter considering the above points, we suggest you terminate any contact with this girl. It is incorrect to ask Allah to unite you with her in Jannah. In conclusion, we suggest you contact some Muslim women folk nearby who can influence and convince her to accept Islam.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
