  "question": "What do muslims have against hindus?Why is everything to do with hinduism so haram,when hinduism is much older than islam?Would that not mean that everyone at some stage converted?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMuslims do not have anything against Hindus, rather the Hindus should be asked what is it that they have against the Muslims that leads them to massacre and rape Muslims every so often in India! Hinduism is a religion of idolatry and shirk (polytheism) which is completely contrary to the teachings of Islam and to the intellect. Idolatry is Haram and when that is the basis of Hinduism, most things connected to Hinduism would naturally be Haraam as well.\n\nThe concept of worshipping one Allah is the natural religion and disposition of man and was the religion from the time of Adam (Alahis Salam), thus the central and primary concepts and beliefs of Islam are much older than those of Hinduism. Yes the Shariah of Nabi (salallahu alaihi wasallam) came after Hinduism, however coming first does not demand that it is the correct religion.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
