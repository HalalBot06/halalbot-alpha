  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy dad recently bought a house that we have been renting for the past few years. The house is not new. Last night he had a dream as follows. He saw 2 little children(jinn) sitting on our window and one of them asked my dad to feed him and my dad ignored him. Then later when my dad was praying, the other one came and asked to feed him. And my dad told him move and let me pray right now. Both of them were hungry. What is the significance of this dream and how can we feed them if they're actually in our house. jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream has no indication of Jinns being in the house.\n\nWe advise the members of the family perform their daily Salaat and perform\ntheir daily Salaats and recite a portion of the Qur'aan everyday in the\nhouse.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
