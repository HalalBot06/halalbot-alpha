  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Aqaaid (beliefs) of the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah`, Adhaabul%0D%0AQabr (punishment in the grave) is Haqq (true and established). (Sharhul%0D%0AAqaaid)%0D%0A%0D%0AThat (punishment of the grave) is proven from the Qur'aan and Ahaadith.%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala discusses the punishment given to Fir'awn. He says, 'The fire%0D%0Ais given to them in the morning and evening and on the day of judgement.'%0D%0AThe fire before the day of judgment refers to the punishment in the grave.%0D%0A(Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'When a person is buried and%0D%0Athe people go away, two angels approach the deceased and ask three%0D%0Aquestions, a) Who is your lord? b) What is your religion? and c) Who is he%0D%0A(Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam))?. A believer will answer all%0D%0Athree questions and he will be honoured with the clothing of Jannah. the%0D%0Awindow of Jannah will be opened for him and he will enjoy the sight of%0D%0AJannah. On the contrary, a disbeliever will express regret at not being able%0D%0Ato answer the questions. Upon that, an angel who is blind and deaf is%0D%0Aappointed to punish him. Blind so that the angel does not see the punishment%0D%0Aand feel mercy and deaf so that the punishment is not heard. The hammer used%0D%0Ato punish a disbeliever is so heavy that it can reduce a mountain to dust.%0D%0AThe disbeliever screams with pain and every creation can hear him besides%0D%0Ahuman and Jinns.' (Mishkaat)%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'The grave is a garden of%0D%0Aparadise or a pit of hell.' (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'It has been revealed to me%0D%0Athat the trial in the grave is similar to the trial of Dajjaal.' (Tirmidhi)%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'If you are made to listen to%0D%0Athe punishment in the grave, you will stop burying your deceased.'%0D%0A(Tirmidhi)%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised, 'Seek protection from the%0D%0Apunishment of the grave.' (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn one Hadith, two reasons have been cited for the punishment in the grave:%0D%0Aa) Not exercising precaution from the splashes of urine drops, b) Gossiping.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt was the noble habit of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) to make%0D%0ADu'aa in Salaat for protection from the punishment of the grave. May Allah%0D%0ATa'ala save us, our families and the entire Ummah from the trials of the%0D%0AQabr.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
