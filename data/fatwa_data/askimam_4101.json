  "question": "Can I marry against my parents wishes?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nmy father does not want me to remarry, and I have found someone suitable. they feel a woman should not be married more than once. Do I have to respect their wishes or can I go ahead and marry this man?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe feeling that a female should not marry more than once is incorrect.\n\nAllah Ta'ala says in the noble Qur'aan, 'And do not stop them (females) from\nremarrying.' Most of the wives of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)\nwere widows before marrying Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). In\nfact, Hadhrat Khadija (Radhiallaahu Anha) was twice a widow before marrying\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nWe advise you apply wisdom in communicating the above to your parents before\ngoing ahead. Their blessings will be a means of peace and happiness for you.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
