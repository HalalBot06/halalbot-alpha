  "answer": "QUESTION\nThere is only 2 years difference between my self and my mums younger brothers. My mother says it is wrong for my to socialse with them is this true?(I am female) also is it permissible for us to be alone together in the same room?. I know the rulings regarding those men whom you are eligible to marry. but wanted to know what the hadiths have to say about uncles (that is your parents siblings)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMother?s brother is a Mahram (prohibited in marriage). Therefore, in principle there is no Hijaab between uncle and niece. However, if both are young, then they should not associate with one another freely. and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
