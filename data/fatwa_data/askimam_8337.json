  "question": "I am 15 years old and my family are not religious they all listen to music, watch tv & Swear, and donâ€™t wear hijab.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIt?s only my mum that wears hijab but she still listens to music and watches t.v. .me, my little 12 year old brother, grandma & grandad are the only ones that try our best to stay on the right track.but it is quite hard with them lot all messing around.could u give me advice on how to get them interested in deen. Duas or anything.also when we go out in the car my cousin who is 1 year older than me I make her sit in the back of the car and I sit in the front because we live in an area where they isn?t a lot of muslims and everyone wears revealing clothes and I always hear her talking about boys and ive seen her before looking at them when she sits in the front of the car, she doesn?t wear hijab & does the same as above. Am I doing the right thing making her sit in the back..i do it this way so she cant look at boys and they cant see her when we go past all the non muslims in the area.am I doing the right thing.plus I have seen religious men who have their wife or sister in the backseat and normally the men in the front.could you please tell me if I am doing the right thing, I think it is a way of protecting her.am I correct.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMasha-Allah It is so encouraging to learn of a youth showing interest in deen surrounded by so many temptations. Lets start with music ?confidently take interest in alternate halaal entertainment ?like Arabic songs, nasheeeds, nazms without musical instruments. There is a wide range enjoyed by adults and youth and is very soothing to the mind ? By playing these not forcefully ? however for your enjoyment will most certainly , stir an interest in others. Just by example others will follow. %0D%0A%0D%0ATo note people don?t like to be lectured or attacked on how bad they are. Concentrate on your connection in Allah Ta?ala eg. Concentration in your salaah, reading Islaamic literature, learning Quraan Tafseer, Hadith etc.. In the interim enjoy halaal pleasures like cloths, food, hobbies within Sharia ? when you leave home then obviously cover up. One does not have to become too strict, especially where it becomes difficult. Sitting in front or back of the car is one?s own preference and should not become a law. We should not make Islaam difficult neither should we transgress the laws. When your cousin sees that you?re cool yet following Islaam and happy ? automatically she will take interest Insha-Allah ? Avoid too much fault finding, etc. %0D%0A%0D%0AAlso to note, perhaps your cousin needs to ?belong? or ?identify? ? perhaps she also has a background of concerns or problems? Or influences at school or environment. Her rebelling on a very strict life not being able to live r fit in is a difficulty. Hence win her with love, comment on her good Qualities , her positive aspects and enjoy halaal entertainment with her, Insha-Allah you will win her away from evil. May Allah keep you strong and help you and make you amongst the good, positive, pious Muslim women in the world.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0ASister Amatullah%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
