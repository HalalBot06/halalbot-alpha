During the conquest of\nMakkah, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) accompanied by some Sahaba\nentered the Ka'bah and performed salaah. One may face towards any direction\nwhile performing salaah in the Ka'bah as every wall of the Ka'bah is Qibla.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
