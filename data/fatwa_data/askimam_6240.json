  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu-alaikum, I was performing salaat in jamaat whe I noticed my youngest daughter was about to get into danger; I said one \"salam\" and left the prayer. Of course, I repeated the entire salaat a bit later when others were done. Did I do the right thing? I also heard that the salaat remains intact until I speak; I could have rejoined the jamaat. Is that true? Or is it best that I repeat the entire salaat.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn some instances, it is Waajib to break one's Salaat, e.g. if the is fear\nof loss of one life or personal belonging or fear for one's child.\n\nIn your case, you were absolutely correct by breaking your Salaat. However,\nthis Salaat is now broken because you have done an act contrary to Salaat.\n(Tahtaawi pg.230)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
