  "question": "What should I do when there are different Salah timetables?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have two different Salah timing charts for my location. I assume that the differences in time are due to different methods of calculation. The times for Salah are nearly the same except for Fajr. On one chart Fajr begins a considerable time earlier. I have been using the earlier Fajr time to start sawm (fasting) in the morning and the later time for the Fajr Salah. Is it permissible to use the two Salah charts as mentioned above or should I just use one?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nYour practice to follow the earlier Fajr time to commence fasting and the later time to perform Fajr Salah is appropriate and based on precaution.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n \n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
