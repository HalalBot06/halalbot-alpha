  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0AWe have not been able to locate any specific Du'aa or Surah to be recited%0D%0Aupon this occasion. One should, however, ask Allah Ta'ala for Barkat%0D%0A(blessings), mercy and a good outcome. The following Du'aas could be%0D%0Arecited,%0D%0A1. 'Allaahumma Ahsin aaqibatanaa fil umoori kullihaa wa ajirnaa min%0D%0Akhizyiddunya wa adhaabil aakhira' (Oh Allah, grant us a good outcome in all%0D%0Aour matters and save us from worldly disgrace and punishment in the%0D%0Ahereafter). (Hisnul Haseen pg.469; Darul Ishaat)%0D%0A2. Allaahumma innee as-aluka min fadhlika wa rahmatika fa innahuu la yamliku%0D%0Ahaa illaa anta%0D%0A%0D%0AOne should also be sure to say 'Salaam' whenever entering the home as this%0D%0Awill be a source of blessings for himseld and the members of his household.%0D%0ATogether with this, he should recite the Masnoon Du'aas for entering a home%0D%0Aas follows:%0D%0AAllaahumma innee as-aluka kharal mawlaj wa khairal makhraj. Bismillaahi%0D%0Awalajnaa wa bismillaahi kharajnaa wa alallaahi rabbinaa tawakkalnaa%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is advisable also that Dhikr (remembrance of Allah) and Salaat take place%0D%0Aregularly to ensure that divine blessings remain in the home and the lives%0D%0Aof its occupants. It is our humble suggestions that a few Ahaadith from%0D%0AFadhaail-e-Aamaal of Shaykh Zakariyya be read daily as Ahaadith create%0D%0Aspecial Noor (light) in the home.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
