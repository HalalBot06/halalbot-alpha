  "answer": "QUESTION\nis it allowed to fast for 30 days or more, other then in the month of ramazan, i was doing this as i am not married and i wasted quite a lot of money these days so i felt that inorder to repent for what i have done, I should do this and still feel like its not enough. And as if we dont feel secure without marriage and still its not possible to marry is it a bad thing to fast like this eventhough i didnt injudge in any major sins yet. Insha Allah i am healthy and 22 years old male and yet i didnt feel any side affacts due to my fasting like this and i feel good as i can stay away from looking at sinful places, i wanted to clear this, as a friend of mine said its not good to fast like this and its mentioned in the Quran not to do so if its not the month of ramazan.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. You may fast continuously for more than 30 days if your intention is to suppress your base desires and you are not in a position to marry presently.\n\n2. You don?t have to fast to repent. The best form of repentance is to beg Allah?s forgiveness.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
