  "answer": "QUESTION\nIt is said that reciting Surah Al Rahman 11 times for 11 days fulfills ones needs. Is this true. Are there any other Surahs that can be recited in order to get one?s need fulfilled. What are the duas or Surahs in case a person wants to pray to Allah for return of someone. Plus, is there any concept of love marriage in Islam. If not, why do our elders ask the younger ones to chose and like a marriage partner for themselves. Mainly parents tell their children to like someone and have an understanding with someone, when a certain age is reached. Is this un Islamic? We are not supposed to talk to any Ghair Mahram before marriage. Then why do our elders say this. What if someone is defeated in love and doesn?t want to marry anymore. What is the desired age of getting married. Why can?t a person get married at the age of 20.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person is in need of something then he should pray two rakaats nafil Salaat called Salaatul Haajat. After this make dua to Allah for whatever is needed. Insha Allah the need would be fulfilled. %0D%0A%0D%0AAlso a person should recite Surat Yaseen for his needs.%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Abdullah Ibn Zubair has narrated that whoever reads Surat Yaseen for his need then it will be fulfilled.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe return of someone is also a need so therefore recite surat yaseen, salaatul haajat as well as dua should be made in abudance.%0D%0A%0D%0ATho concept of \"love before marriage\" is baseless in Islam. This is the ideology of the west that both spouses should have relationship with each other so that they may come to know each other. In todays life the reason why many parents tell their children to like someone and have an understanding with someone is because they want to make their families \"modern\" and \"not left behind\" by following the ways of the west.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever according to the Shariat it is prohibited for a man to have any contact with any strange-woman, and vice versa. %0D%0A%0D%0AAccording to Imam Abu Hanifa rahmatullah alaih Nikah is wajib if the person is full of desires. However if his desires are defeated then Nikah is Sunnat. If one has the means of getting married then he should, as marriage is a great sunnat with many benifits and it holds a lot of reward.%0D%0A%0D%0AA person should get married as soon as he%2Fshe is ready. If the person has a lot of desires and fears that he may be indulging himself in adultery%2Ffornication then he must get married straight away. This will close his doors to major sin. %0D%0A%0D%0AIf a person is ready to get married at the age of 20 then he should do so. However if this age is against his wishes he may delay it if he%2Fshe has no fear of committing fornication. You should get married when you have found a righteous partner.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
