  "question": "My brother is engaged, but still keeps a girlfriend. I am worried about his situation. What can I do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two aspects here:\nOne is I'elaam (to inform) and the other is I'emaal (to make others\npractice). Informing is merely a means of making others practice. The\npurpose (to make others practice) should be placed first and then wisdom\nshould be applied in trying to achieve the purpose.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
