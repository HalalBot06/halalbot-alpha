  "answer": "QUESTION\n1.Is wudu broken if you laugh during whilst making wudu, 2. also what are the acts of kufr could you please list them and give some explanation to the more complicated ones.Also I know a shiit person he says salaam to me what should I do and what is the sin if I reply to his salaam with salaam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. No.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. There are two ways of Irtidaad (becoming a Kaafir);%0D%0A%0D%0Aa. A person clearly changes his religion to another, for example, Christianity, Judaism, etc. or he denies the existence or oneness of Allah Ta?ala or he denies the prophethood of Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0Ab. He does not clearly change his religion but he adopts such beliefs, actions or sayings which is synonymous to denial of the Qur?aan or prophethood, for exaple, by rejecting a law which has been established clearly by the Qur?aan or by a Mutawaatir Hadith (a terminology in Hadith which means that many person in every era narrate an incident that it is impossible that they have conspired to fabricate a Hadith). (Jawaahirul Fiqh part1 pg.23) This is just the basic principle with regards to Kufr which entails a lot of details.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. To greet a Kaafir in a way of honouring him is Kufr. If honour is not intended rather just as a greeting, then it is not permissible. However, if there is a need then it will be permissible but the words, ?Assalaamu alaa manit tabaa al-hudaa? should be used. It is permissible to reply to the greeting of a Kaafir but in reply one should only say ?Wa alaika?.
