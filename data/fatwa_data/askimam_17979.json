Thank you\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n1) Lottery, which is considered gambling, and selling/drinking intoxicants are both strictly impermissible in Shari’ah. Allah Ta’ala states in the Holy Quran:\n\nيا أيها الذين آمنوا إنما الخمر والميسر والأنصاب والأزلام رجس من عمل الشيطان فاجتنبوه لعلكم تفلحون (90) إنما يريد الشيطان أن يوقع بينكم العداوة والبغضاء في الخمر والميسر ويصدكم عن ذكر الله وعن الصلاة فهل أنتم منتهون (91)\n\n“O you who believe! Wine, gambling, altars, and divining arrows are filth, made up by Satan. Therefore, refrain from it, so that you may be successful. Satan wishes only to plant enmity and malice between you through wine and gambling, and to prevent you from the remembrance of Allah and from Salah. Would you, then, abstain?” (5:90-91)\n\nRasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) has said in Hadith:\n\nعن جابر بن عبد الله - رضى الله عنهما - أنه سمع رسول الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - يقول عام الفتح وهو بمكة « إن الله ورسوله حرم بيع الخمر »\n\n“Indeed Allah and His Messenger have prohibited the sale of intoxicants” (Sahih al-Bukhari)\n\n« إن الذى حرم شربها حرم بيعها »\n\n“Indeed the One who prohibited drinking it prohibited the sale of it (intoxicants) (Sahih Muslim)\n\nMoreover, the sale of liquor and lottery tickets is considered to be a direct form of I’anah ‘alal Ma’siyyah (assisting in sin) which is prohibited. Allah Ta’ala says:\n\nولا تعاونوا على الإثم والعدوان\n\nAnd do not help each other in sin and aggression. (Verse: 5:2)\n\nIn light of the abovementioned, it will not be permissible to sell lottery tickets and intoxicants, as this is a clear violation of Shari’ah. Any profit which has been made selling these prohibited items must be disposed off to charity without the intention of gaining reward.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
