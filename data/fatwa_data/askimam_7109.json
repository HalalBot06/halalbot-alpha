  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn an earlier fatwa you mentioned that the 26th-27th ayah of Surah Imran is very special in terms of duas. Does this mean one must read both the 26th and 27th ayah? or from the 26th to the 27th ayah? (not reading the 27th and finishing on the 28th) Also, Ive received the following hadith from a reliable source, please comment on its authenicity and also what it means, is wudhu valid if one does not smell or hear anything? Please answer as soon as possible as ramadan is approaching and I really need my prayers answered. JazakhAllah Barakatuhu Wudu - 12th Rabi-ath-Thani 1423 (24 June 2002) Narrated by Abbas bin Tamim (Radhiallaho anho): My uncle said: The Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wasallam) said, \"One should not leave his prayer unless he hears sound or smells something.\" Bukhari Vol. 1 : No. 177\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. You should read the whole of the 26th verse as well as the whole of the 27th verse.\n\n2. The Hadith means that on a mere suspicion one should not consider the Wudhu to be broken. If one is sure that one has passed wind from the rear then the Wudhu has broken. Two examples of how one can be sure is; that one hears the passing of the wind or one smells it. However, being sure is not confined to these two methods. If one is sure by any other means then the Wudhu is broken.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
