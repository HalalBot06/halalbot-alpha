  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)My question is, is it okay to watch Islamic videos, like \"The Message(part 1 and 2)? It is about Prophet PBUH, how his message spread, in short, and 2 wars, but it doesn't show anyone to represent Muhammad (PBUH)...2nd Q) Do you have to have Wudhu to read Islamic books...any kind? 3rd Q) How did the war after Bud 'r end? There were alot of disbelievers than believers but won but suddenly more disbelievers came from behind...So what exactly happened? 4th Q) Is it okay to be like Muhammad PBUH like act seriously and try to feel like you are useful for Islam by trying to be like Muhammad PBUH...or will it be disrespectful to him? 5th) What kind of books have stories of Muhammad PBUH, like his wars, his acts and all, can you name some?6th) Who will go to Hell if at Jesus(PBUH)'s time, Jews And Christians will become Muslims? Thank you!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\na) To watch movies based on Islamic topics is not permissible because the%0D%0Aactors portray great Sahaabas and these actors are not in the position to%0D%0Aportray such great champions of Islam. Also, there are many changes that the%0D%0Adirector puts in or tries to portray that goes against that part of portion%0D%0Aof our history. Most importantly is the person tries to remember a%0D%0Aparticular Sahaabi, flashes of that actor comes into that person's mind.%0D%0AThis is not permissible.%0D%0Ab) You do not need Wudhu to read Islamic books.%0D%0Ac) From your question, there sees to be confusion between the battle of Badr%0D%0Aand the battle of Uhud. It's in the battle of Uhud that Khalid ibn Walid%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhu) attacked from the back, but eventually the Muslims did%0D%0Awin.%0D%0Ad) We can only try to follow the Sunnah of our Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) and aspire to be like him in every facet of our lives. This is%0D%0Arespect, not disrespect.%0D%0Ae) Books life, 'The Life of Rasulullah' by Haykeh, 'Battles in Islam'. Books%0D%0Aon Seerah will give an excellent account of the battles.%0D%0Af) Those who reject Allah and Rasool (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) will%0D%0Aenter into the fire.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
