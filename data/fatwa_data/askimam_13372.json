  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ncan you please help me , because I  don't know what to do with my husband. we've been married for just over seventeen years and he will not pray his namaaz or read the quran sharif. Almost everyday i tell him to  pray, but when I do he always becomes very angry with me. I pray for him, I explain to him the consequences, I even argue with him , I stop talking to him just so that he may start doing ibaadat, but he just doesn't bother. Please can you tell me if there is a special ayat I can pray that will make him start praying. Because its got to the point that I just feel like I hate him every time I loook at him because he has neglected his duties. I have three children and I am scared that it might rub off on the children\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nShe can read, Allahumma Salli ‘Alaa Muhammadin Bi ‘Adadi Kulli Daain Wa Dawaain Wa Baarik WA Sallim.500 times daily then make Du’aa.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf\nDARUL IFTA – JAMEAH MAHMOODIYAH, SPRINGS\n\nJOINT PROJECT WITH DARUL IFTA, MADRASAH IN’AAMIYYAH, CAMPERDOWN"
