  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAsalamalaikum Mufti Sb ,\nAccording to this Fatwa #  16743 we cannot subscribe to the Medical Aid Insurance , but according to this Fatwa #  9817\nCan we make use of the Medical Insurance Card Offered by company(Free medical Insurance)\n\nHope you clear out this doubt as soon as possible\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThere is a difference between both situations. In situation of fatwah 16743, the prohibition is based on one taking out a conventional medical insurance aid which is not permissible.\n\n \n\nIn fatwah 9817, the individual does not take out the insurance. He is given the benefit of the use of the card. He himself does no contribute to the medical aid insurance.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
