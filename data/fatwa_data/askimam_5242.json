  "question": "Qurbani... a ritual to be performed",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIt has become a scapegoat for the Muslims living in countries like US to just give qurbani money to a butcher shop who would do qurbani on their behalf or to send the money to their home countries and ask someone to do qurbani on their behalf. In most cases people dont do it personally 'cause: 1- Its a hassle to go to some slaughter house and the whole process would take hours. 2- Many just cant slaughter an animal on their own. 3- Its little in-expensive to send money home. I understand that qurbani meat can help needy and poor in the countries like Pakistan but why are we just thinking about helping needy in this way and neglecting the beautiful sunnah of Hazrat Ibrahim (AS) which has numeruous advantages: 1- Its a sunnah of Holy Prophet (PBUH) and he did this himself. 2- The new generation know nothing about this ritual. All they know is that they would go to a butcher shop give some money and will collect the meat later without any hassle. They dont know what is slaughtering, how to slaughter an animal in an Islamic way, how to choose the right animal for slaughtering etc. As far as I know this ritual is about performing qurbani as performed by Holy Prophet(PBUH) and in the essence has nothing to do with helping poor and its even permissble for the person performing the qurbani to consume all the meat. Allah knows the best. Jazak-Allah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAs far as possible, people should do their own Qurbaani as this exposes them\nto its spirit. Also, to send it elsewhere - for whatever reason - is\npermitted.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
