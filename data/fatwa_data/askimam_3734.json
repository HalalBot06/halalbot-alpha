  "question": "Is it pemissibale to deal in currencies on the foreign exchange markets.Whereby you buy and sell rands,dollars.etc.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible to buy and sell foreign currencies.\n\nDealing (purchasing and selling) in foreign currency is termed as\nBay-us-Sarf. The Fuqahaa (jurists) have ruled that Tamaasul (equality) is\nnot necessary in the buying and selling of foreign exchange. Hence, one\ndollar may be sold more than its equivalent value in rands. However,\nIttihaad-e-Majlis (one sitting) is necessary in such a transaction.\nTherefore, the exchange of the dollar and rand must take place in the same\nsitting. If the foreign exchange is done in different sittings as is the\ncase in forex companies, then the contemporary Fuqahaa have ruled that the\nspot trading is sufficient to fulfil the condition of Ittihaad-e-Majlis.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
