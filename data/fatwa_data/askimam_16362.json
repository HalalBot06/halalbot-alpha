  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am a student and have to pay my fees online quite a few times which requires me to have a credit card because the debit cards offered by the banks are not accepted. The problem is that in the banks charge an annual fees on having a credit card which in some banks is deducted on an monthly basis. Therefore, if I pay all my dues on time i.e before the interest accrues is it permissible for me to keep a credit card, if there are annual charges attached to it.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is permissible to make use of the credit card facility on condition payments to your account is made timeously to avoid paying interest.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
