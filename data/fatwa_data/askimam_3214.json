  "question": "Who may perform Hajj Badal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it only family members or any Muslim? Also my mum is getting old and has not performed her hajj yet. My dad has gone several times to hajj but never has taken my mum, they do not get on well togeather. Is it my duty to take her (her son). I can not stand my mother and she causes a lot of problems. I wish to go to hajj on my own or with my wife as it is only obligatory once, and you dont get a chance to go every day. I want to be happy and remember my hajj and do everything right, if i take my mum she will ruin all this and i will not perform my hajj properly?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf you are certain that taking your mother along with you for Hajj will\ndefeat the purpose of Hajj, then you do not have to take her with you.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
