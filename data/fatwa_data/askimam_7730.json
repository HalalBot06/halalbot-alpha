  "answer": "QUESTION\n2) Also, can a muslim become an insurance agent? 3) I live in a boarding school so I share bathrooms with ghair muslims. Is it okay if I begin wudhu in one bathroom and finish in another, assuming I exit one and enter the other immediately? Jaza-Kala Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. All types of commercial insurance are Haraam (prohibited) as they contain elements of interest and gambling. Therefore, it is incorrect for a Muslim to become an agent for any insurance company.\n\n2. It is correct for you to begin Wudhu in one bathroom and complete in another. However, the time from exiting one bathroom and entering the other should not be so long that the limbs washed in first bathroom become dry before entering the second bathroom. (Qudoori pg.3; Qazi)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
