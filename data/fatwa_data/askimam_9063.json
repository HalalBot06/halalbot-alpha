  "question": "When the bride to be decides not to accept any mahr (BEFOREthe nikaah), what is the next course of action? In other words, how is this non-acceptance acknowledged in the written marriage agreement?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, it is Makrooh (undesirable) for females to perform Salat in congregation. A female should perform Salat by herself and should also be trained accordingly.\n\nHowever, if females only congregate for Salaat, the female Imaam should stand in line with her followers and not in front as is the procedure among males.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
