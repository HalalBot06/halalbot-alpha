  "answer": "QUESTION\n1.Is my marriage valid? Two witnesses (one of whom also acted as Wakeel,) and the man (not an Iman) who married us (all 3 pious Muslim males).Only the one who married me was personally known. The Wakeel was not, but I said OK to him acting as Wakeel.There was a verbal proposal & acceptance. There was no maher then or deferred, at all. There was no written contract at all. Marriage took place in my home, not a mosque. It was announced publicly to friends beforehand. Is it valid? 2. Different situation: When a maher is specified in $$$ what percantage goes to the Iman or mosque that married you? Please help me..May Allah bless you for the work you do here.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If there were three Muslim males present at the Nikah besides you and\nyour marriage partner, then the Nikah is valid. The Mahr must be paid to the\nwife.\n2. You may offer any amount voluntarily to the Imaam or the Musjid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
