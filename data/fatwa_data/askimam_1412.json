  "question": "As a daughter who is already married, what are her obligations to her parents?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Ibrahim Desai, I am a happily married woman. My husband is very understanding about alot of things. My parents are in their early sixties and I have 2 older brothers who are not yet supportive nor understanding towards my parents. One brother is successful but is too influenced by his wife and other one is married and working but still very much dependent on my parents. I am very concerned about my parents who are fulltime working professionals and it hurts to see my parents so stressed out. I have offered by help several times in terms of helping out with groceries etc and I even tell them that if the times comes, I will be MOST happy to have them in my home. My parents appreciate it but tell me that they'd be better off alone. I am really depressed and I wish I could get some assistance/guidance from you. I love my parents alot. Jazak Allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle as a female you are not responsible to financially support your\nparents. If you do so with the consent of your husband it will be an act of\ngreat virtue and merit for which it is hoped that you will be rewarded even\nin your lifetime.\n\nAnd Allah Ta`ala Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
