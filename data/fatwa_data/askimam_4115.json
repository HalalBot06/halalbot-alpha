We advise you bring up\nthe courage and apply wisdom in communicating your difficulty with your both\nparents, or either one, with whosoever you are more comfortable and\ngradually confess your past with them. That will enable you to avert the\npressure from you. Feeling sorry for the person is no reason for you to\nmarry him. You should seek the advise of your parents as well as make\nIstikhaara before deciding on the matter.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
