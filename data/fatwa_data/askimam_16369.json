  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ninshallah i am learning to read my 5 times salah but as yet i do not know all my surahs off by heart but i knw all my duas  and some surahs ie surah fatihah,the 3 kuls and ayat al kursi, i pray to allah to give me the taufeeq to read salah but what i need to know is will i get ghunaa (sin) if i make a mistake or if i dont know sumthing even if i am reading my namaaz.\n\nsomeone told me that if my intention is there then inshallah allah swt will except my salah what are your views and also they told me if i dont know then if i resd subhanallah throughout inshallah that may be ok??\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nYou know Sura Fatiha, three Quls and Ayatul Kursi. You should read these suras in salah. You cannot read Subhanallah in place of reading the Quran as you can recite few suras from the Quran.\n\nIf you make a mistake in your recitation, your salah will be valid. May Allah grant you more tawfeeq to increase your knowledge of Islam, Aameen.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
