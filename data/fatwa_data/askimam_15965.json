Obviously, Islam does not allow you to abandon your parents regardless of their religious persuasions. However, due to a clash of religions, there may be conflict at times. Be very polite to her and encourage her to convert as well.\nNo, you are not allowed to attend her funeral nor are you permitted to administer the funeral rites. Let someone else do it. Furthermore, cremation is prohibited in Islam, regardless of the religion of the person.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
