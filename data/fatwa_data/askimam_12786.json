  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Sahab, As salaamu alaikum wa rahmatullah. In our city, Madaris and Makatib keep their yearly program(jalsa). In these programs, ulama-i-kiram of outstation are invited.They are giving bayaan at the end of the program.Their traveling expense is given by madaris and makatib, which crosses thousands of rupees. In the program(jalsa) heavy amount is spent for decoration, food etc. Some times, this program is kept in a Hall, which is having high rent(per hour). Every year, large amount money of the common people is spent in this type of program. 1) Is it permissible to do this type of jalsa(program)? 2) Is it permissible to attend this type of jalsa(program)?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBefore answering your query, it is important to understand the purpose of Jalsas. The condition of the Ummah is in a pitiful state. This is clear from the condition of the Ummah in many parts of the world. We are pushed from pillar to post and we are forced to stay in a suppressed condition. We have lost our dignity and honour.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe have become victims of a inferiority complex. This has led us to adopt the ways of non-Muslims and have little regard for our own values. We have lost our dynaminism. There is an urgent need for us to initiate an Islamic renaissance and inspire the Muslims in particular and the world in general about Islam. Until the Ummah is not inspired and motivated, we will be a stagnant, nay, a retrogressive Ummah. Every new movement, group or organisation spends millions to make themselves known. They travel criss-cross the world and are well sponsored with first class tickets and luxury hotels. All this for the Dunya. They understand the importance of their commitment and spend to achieve their objectives. In today?s times of ignorance of Islam, there is an urgent need to educate the Ummah.%0D%0A%0D%0AThere is nothing more important than Islamic education and inspiring the Ummah who are experiencing an all time low. The Muslim Ummah generally is ignorant of even the basic laws of Shari?ah, leave aside the other important aspects; economics, politics, etc. There is a great need to educate and inspire the Ummah which is also done through Jalsas. Competent ulama are invited and the general masses are inspired by their discourses. Many make good intentions and reform themselves. Others make intentions to sacrifice their children to become Huffaaz and Ulama. If we compare the efforts and monetary expenses in secular education in relation to Islamic education, then one will not complain. One of the objectives of Jalsas is to draw the people closer to an Islamic institute and Ulama. This is vital in this age and era when people are attracted to so many un-Islamic institutions and organisations. In order to achieve the important objectives of the Jalsa, it is equally important that such events are professionally conducted and co-ordinated.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
