Rather, it has created facility by\nleaving these to the discretion of the individual, as per his circumstance.\nSome Ulama have written that a wife has the right to visit her parents\nweekly but not to spend a night away from the home provided by her husband\nwithout his permission. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyyah Vol. 17 Pg. 273)\n2) Beyond basic necessities of life, one may exercise his discretion. If\ntraveling expenses are not affordable, one may still keep up family ties by\nwritten or telephonic correspondence. Allaamah Shaami (R.A) has written, \"If\nthey (relatives) are distant, he must join ties by written correspondence.\nIf he is able to visit them, it is more virtuous.\" (Raddul Muhtaar Vol. 9\nPg. 589 Imdaadiyyah).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT"
