  "question": "Does Allah Ta'ala'a sift of Haazir wa Naazir mean Qadir wa Khabeer over everything, or does it signify \"Mutlaq Hullul\"?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs Salaamu alykum Mufti Sahib Some people are propogating that whenever the words \"Allah is Everywhere\" is mentioned in a book, it does not mean Haazir (i.e Khabeer wa Qadir) but it means that Nauzubillah Allah Ta'ala is dissolved within the creation.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah being Haazir (present) and Naazir (Seeing) refers to His knowledge\nbeing Perfect and Absolute. Nothing is concealed from the Perfect Knowledge\nof Allah.\n\nThe concept of Allah being dissolved within the creation is incorrect.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
