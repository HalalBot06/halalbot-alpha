  "question": "Are women allowed to talk to men?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it haraam for a woman to speak to a non-mahram man if she has no dire need for the speaking? I understand speaking to men is allowed i.e. in medical emergency etc. But how about just talking about this and that? And is women's voice awrah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for strange males and females to talk to one another without any valid Shar'ee excuse. If there is a valid reason, the talk should be restricted to the necessity. In that situation too, it is prohibited for the female to talk in a soft and alluring tone as that conduct excites a male's passion. and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
