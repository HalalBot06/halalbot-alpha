  "question": "please explain to me if Allah SWT has two eyes, two hands and face?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta?ala is beyond comprehension. We are too weak in understanding His attributes and Himself.\n\nAlthough various verses of the noble Qur?aan indicate and make mention of ?hands?, etc. attributed to Allah Ta?ala, this is in the complete knowledge of Him Alone. Therefore, we believe in Allah Ta?ala and all his qualities as he is.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
