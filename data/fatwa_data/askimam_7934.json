  "question": "Is wudhu valid if made with contact lenses worn on ones eyes.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRecently i read in a islamic newspaper that wudhu is not valid with contact lenses being worn. I wear prescription lenses because wearing glasses was becoming difficult especially with thick lenses. What worries me is if my wudhu is not valid my salaah is void and also possibly other ibaadats such as Haj etc, as i have been wearing them for many years. Please comment urgently. Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is only necessary to wash the external part of the face during Wudhu. The eye is considered as the internal part of the face, it is not necessary to put water in the eyes during Wudhu.\n\nTherefore, Wudhu with contact lenses is valid and the Salaat will be correct.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
