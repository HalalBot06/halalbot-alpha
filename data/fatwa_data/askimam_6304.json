  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaam dear Mufti, sorry that this is long, but can you please let me know the meaning of my dream and the answers to the other 2 questions. Dream, I had a dream in where I was among a large gathering of people around a valley and we were all waiting for QIYAMAT. I was very happy and looking forward to it. There was this horn and I went and sat down wit everyone else. At this time I was a bit nervous as Allah was about to come. At this time I woke up. Can you please explain this dream for me. Hadith, I have recently been told that the Hadith are not true, they are what some people have said long after our prophet (SAW). Another thing I have been told, is that how can someone question one of our prophet?s wifes (after his passing away) when it is not allowed for someone to make any sort of contact with ghar women? Can you please answer this questions? Punishment in the grave, Have been told by the same source that we can not be punished in the grave for our sins and expect to be punished again after qiyamat? Can you please answer this questions?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'That person who loves to%0D%0Ameet Allah, Allah will love to meet him.' When a person is conscious of life%0D%0Aafter death and accountability, he%2Fshe will adhere to Shari'ah and gain the%0D%0Arecognition of Allah. When the love of Allah increases, the person looks%0D%0Aforward to meet Allah.%0D%0A2. Kindly find attached, 'Hadith'.%0D%0A3. The wives of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) remained his wives%0D%0Aafter his demise. However, they were bearers of the Ahaadith of Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) referred%0D%0Atheir queries to the wives of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). They%0D%0Aimparted knowledge to whoever enquired from them. That was their%0D%0Aresponsibility to do so.%0D%0A4. Kindly refer below 'Punishment in the Grave'.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0AAccording to the Aqaaid (beliefs) of the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah`, Adhaabul %0D%0AQabr (punishment in the grave) is Haqq (true and established). (Sharhul %0D%0AAqaaid) %0D%0A%0D%0AThat (punishment of the grave) is proven from the Qur'aan and Ahaadith. %0D%0AAllah Ta'ala discusses the punishment given to Fir'awn. He says, 'The fire %0D%0Ais given to them in the morning and evening and on the day of judgement.' %0D%0AThe fire before the day of judgment refers to the punishment in the grave. %0D%0A(Ibid) %0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'When a person is buried and %0D%0Athe people go away, two angels approach the deceased and ask three %0D%0Aquestions, a) Who is your lord? b) What is your religion? and c) Who is he %0D%0A(Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam))?. A believer will answer all %0D%0Athree questions and he will be honoured with the clothing of Jannah. the %0D%0Awindow of Jannah will be opened for him and he will enjoy the sight of %0D%0AJannah. On the contrary, a disbeliever will express regret at not being able %0D%0Ato answer the questions. Upon that, an angel who is blind and deaf is %0D%0Aappointed to punish him. Blind so that the angel does not see the punishment %0D%0Aand feel mercy and deaf so that the punishment is not heard. The hammer used %0D%0Ato punish a disbeliever is so heavy that it can reduce a mountain to dust. %0D%0AThe disbeliever screams with pain and every creation can hear him besides %0D%0Ahuman and Jinns.' (Mishkaat) %0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'The grave is a garden of %0D%0Aparadise or a pit of hell.' (Ibid) %0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'It has been revealed to me %0D%0A%0Athat the trial in the grave is similar to the trial of Dajjaal.' (Tirmidhi) %0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'If you are made to listen to %0D%0Athe punishment in the grave, you will stop burying your deceased.' %0D%0A(Tirmidhi) %0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised, 'Seek protection from the %0D%0Apunishment of the grave.' (Ibid) %0D%0A%0D%0AIn one Hadith, two reasons have been cited for the punishment in the grave: %0D%0Aa) Not exercising precaution from the splashes of urine drops, b) Gossiping. %0D%0A%0D%0AIt was the noble habit of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) to make %0D%0ADu'aa in Salaat for protection from the punishment of the grave. May Allah %0D%0ATa'ala save us, our families and the entire Ummah from the trials of the %0D%0AQabr. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best %0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai %0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
