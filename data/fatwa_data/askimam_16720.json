The same rule will apply for the allergy medicine.\n\n2.      To respect ones mother is fardh. This is a clear injunction of Allah in the Quran. To resent sin is also farsh. You will have to deal with both injunctions carefully. In general you should show respect to your mother and be kind and humble to her. When you witness any violation of Shariah, you should express your concern and aversion to her wrongs without showing disrespect to her. Let her know and feel that your concern is the wrong act and not her. It may be an idea to get in touch with some pious females of the area and get them to come home and interact with your mother. The company and association of pious people have a positive impact on ones character. You may also consider introducing Taleem in the house. For example, read Fazaail-e-Amaal of Hazrath Shaikh Zakariyya (RA) for about five to ten minutes everyday. Inshallah, the words of Allah and his Rasul and  pious people will have an impact on the heart.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
