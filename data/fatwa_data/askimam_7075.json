  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nOurs is a manufacturing concerns did very well in the past. We work on long term projects of Big amounts in millions. Now a days we are not getting projects as we need. When we apply for any quotations the higher staff of that company is asking commission on that project irrespective of quality and price. If we give commission we will get the project if not No project. This the situation. My employer is a strict follower of Islam he said Paying commission to employees of other company for jobs is Haram. Please let us know is it true. If we don't get such type of projects it is difficult to surwive.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe payment of commissions and kick-backs, etc. to employees of other companies is actually another term for bribery.\n\nWhen the executives or bosses of the company come to learn that their employees are collecting commissions on the side, they will take strict action. This is a clear indication that the employees are acting in bad faith against the company. Hence, such payment of commission, etc. is prohibited.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
