  "question": "what is the ruling of singing/listening to a song conatining the phrase'Ya Mustafa'/'Ya Allah.' ect. for the Prophet is no longer amongst us.How do you stand on this matter?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe word ?Ya? in Arabic is for Nida (calling out). It is for Nida Qareeb (calling somebody close or present) or Nida Ba?eed (calling somebody far and away).\n\nThere is no doubt in the permissibility of saying ?Yaa Allah? as Allah is Omnipotent and Omnipresent. It is not permissible to say ?Yaa Mustafa? with the belief that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] is Omnipresent.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
