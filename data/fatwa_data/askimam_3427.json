  "question": "Divorce in anger, and 3 talaaq in one sitting valid?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n(1) Is divorce given in the state of anger valid? (2) If one gives ones' wife 3 talaaq in one sitting then is it valid? (3) I know that prayer is not a transferrable form of worship, ie. no thing can be stood as substitute instead of prayer. But here in Undia maximum nunber of Imams say that 'Fidya' can be given instead of prayer if one is not able to perform salah due to his illness. Now my question is how is it possible? Suppose a man who is very poor and also it is not possible for him to pray because of his illness then how can he give 'Fidya' for his missed salat when the rate of Fidya for one salat is very high?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Divorce given in the state of anger is valid.\n\n2. When a man gives his wife (conceived or not) three Talaaqs (verbally or in writing) it is classified as Talaaq Mughallazah (literally meaning three Talaaqs; whether these Talaaqs were issued in one sitting or on different occasions), they are still valid and regarded as three. They cannot live together as husband and wife.\n\n3. If a poor person is ill and is unable to make Qadhaa, he should make an intention to pay Fidya as soon as it is financially possible to do so. Refer below\n\nand Allah Taâ€™ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nQ: My mother passed away without performing some of her Salaat. Can I perform the Salaat on her behalf?\n\nA: In principle there is no deputation in physical worship, such as, Salaat. Hence, it is not correct for you to perform the Qadhaa Salaats on behalf of your mother. Fidya (monetory compensation) should be given for the missed Salaats from within 1/3 of her Estate if she made a bequest of Fidya. If she did not make a bequest, you should apply your honest discretion for the number of missed Salaats and give the money to the poor and needy Muslims as Fidya for your mother?s missed Salaats. It is hoped that Allah will accept it on behalf of your mother.\n\nThe amount of Fidya for each Fardh Salaat and Witr is equivalent to the amount of Sadaqatul Fitr."
