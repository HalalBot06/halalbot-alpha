  "question": "1)Is Islamic rap songs with music accepted? It is reviving muslims around the world! So what can be wrong?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have not read anywhere or heard anyone say with firm and strong evidence, that Music in Islam is wrong! I am trying to find good Hadith that ALLOWS music or good and strong Hadith that music is HARAAM. Plz email me ALL the Hadith or Quraanic Ayaats that you have. I am a student at a university, and really enjoy, the Islamic raps, sang by Muslim Brothers in America and UK. They make me so Allah conciouse about not only, my duty as a Mu'min but also as an individual. In these times, we have to have an alternative, and that is Islamic Songs with Music, and Television Channels and programs. I stopped listenig to English Music...HOW?..by using ISlamic Raps as an alternative...THIS IS A MUST..!! Ws\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMusic has been condemned strongly in the Qur?aan and Hadith. In Surah Luqmaan, Allah Ta?ala states, ?And from mankind are those that purchase futile speech in order to mislead others from the path of Allah.?%0D%0A%0D%0AUnder the commentary of this verse, ibn Abbaas [Radhiallaahu anhu] states, ?futile speech? refers to music and things related to it. (Durrul Manthoor vol.5 pg.307). In Surah Israaeel, Allah Ta?ala states, ?And excite any of whom you can with your voice.? Imaam Mujaahid mentions, ?voice? refers to music. (Roohul Ma?aani)%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] mentions, ?There will be people from my Ummah who will seek to make lawful fornication, wearing of silk, wine and the use of musical instruments.? (Bukhaari vol.2 pg.837). Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] states, ?A group of my Ummah will drink wine calling it by other than its real name. merry will be made for them through the playing of musical instruments and by the singing of females. Allah will cleave the earth under them and turn them into apes and swines.? (Abu Dawud vol.2 pg.519)%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] further mentions, ?Music grows hypocrisy in the heart just as water causes crops to grow.? (Bayhaqi vol.10 pg.222). Thus, even conceding that there is benefit in such songs, the fact that music is clearly and expressly condemned in the Qur?aan and Hadith would make such songs Haraam.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
