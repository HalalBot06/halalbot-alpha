Some have musical tones or even pictures of animate objects which causes distraction in Salaat. The use of such watches in Salaat is Makrooh (disliked).\n\nIt is permissible to perform Salaat with a simple watch not having musical tones or pictures of animate objects on it or anything that does not cause distraction in Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
