  "question": "I would like to plant a fruit-bearing tree with the intention of sadqah-e-jariya",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to plant a fruit-bearing tree with the intention of sadqah-e-jariya. The compound around my house is completely cemented & I'm not allowed to dig it up. The only space left for planting, is a patch of soil of about 8 feet, where my non-muslim family have buried their two pet dogs. One of the dogs, was buried around 14 years ago, while the 2nd one was buried abt a year ago.\n\n(1) Is it permissible to grow plants/trees on graves? What about a dog's grave?\n\n(2) Would it be ok to plant a tree on the 14 yr old grave? I will not need to dig much; would just sow the seeds a couple if inches below the surface.\n\n(3) Does planting/growing indoor water-plants carry any rewards ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHazrath Anas (R.A.) narrates that Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam said, “No Muslim plants a tree or a plant and a human being or bird or animal eats of it, but that will be charity for him.” (Mishkaat Chapter of  Sadaqa)\nIt is permissible to plant a tree on the old grave.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\nThe guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\nEducation and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\nIslam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\nWhen one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\nMuslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\nWe have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\nIf you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\nIf that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\nRasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit”. \n\n \n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
