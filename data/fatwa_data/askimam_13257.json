  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nConfused about the real meaning of the word \"sunnah\"\n\ni know that growing of the beard to a fist length is wajib, but i do notice many people in everyday talk refer to it as a sunnah. is this correct to refer to this wajib action as a sunnah ?\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nSunnah literally means a pathway or method adopted to do something. Technically, Sunnah refers to every word, actions and acknowledgement that emanated from Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and is suitable for Shar’ee evidence. (Mu’jam istilaahaat Usoolul Fiqh pg.80; Beirut)\n\nLiterally, Waajib means incumbent/binding. Technically, Waajib refers to an action that is established by such a proof that necessitates its practice. (Ibid pg.147-148).\n\nTherefore, the beard is a Sunnah in the sense that it is the practice of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and Waajib in the sense that failure to keep a beard will render a person sinful.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
