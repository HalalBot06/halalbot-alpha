  "question": "www.bux.to - Is it permissible to take part in this?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question is about the interent in making money, i have joined a site that says it pays to click on advertisements, just say if i click on 1 it pays me 15 cents. there are also other websites that are doing the same. we can invest in it to buy referals for example ( $15 = 25 referals) meaning if i buyed that i would have 25 referals that are clicking on ads for me and theres a possibility everyone will click or not some will be inactive and active. there is no gurantee what i will get paid for. the website in refering to is www.bux.to, i was wondering if this gambling?, or is it okay to go ahead..? \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nWe have studied your query and the website you provided.  To our understanding, you will get paid for clicking web-advertisements and visiting their websites.  You also have an option of referring others to participate in which you will be charged for the referral.  If those you referred also visit those sites, you will get additional payment. \n\nThis will not be considered as gambling and will be permissible.  The risk of loss is not due to the fact that it resembles gambling, but it is an element which is part of every business venture.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
