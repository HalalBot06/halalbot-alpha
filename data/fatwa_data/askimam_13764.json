  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissible, to stand for presidency with a fellow muslim on a College Student Council?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf, by standing for presidency on a college student council, your friend would be required to act or pass decisions contrary to the teachings of Shariah, then you are not allowed to support such a cause. On the contrary, if there is benefit in holding such a position, in terms of requesting your permissible needs etc. then you are allowed to stand for presidency with your friend.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf\nDARUL IFTA – JAMEAH MAHMOODIYAH, SPRINGS\n\nJOINT PROJECT WITH DARUL IFTA, MADRASAH IN’AAMIYYAH, CAMPERDOWN"
