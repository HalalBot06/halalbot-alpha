  "question": "what is the current ruling on jihad, is it fard-e-ayn on all muslims or those nearby?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI currently live in the US and I have a few questions about living here.\n\nFirst of all, is making hijra from here recommended? I am wondering because our tax money is going towards the killing of our muslim brothers and sisters. Please explain to me why or why not.\n\nSecond, what is the current ruling on jihad, is it fard-e-ayn on all muslims or those nearby? Many scholars say all muslims should take part, while others say not to take part at all.\n\nFinally, I have taken time off from college and am currently doing hifz, and I was wondering what your opinion is on praying nafl salaat(awabeen, tahajjud, ishraq, etc) and keeping nafl fast(on mondays and thursdays) while doing hifz. I go to madrasah during the morning and i come home later in the day. Is it good to do these nafl acts, or is it better to focus on hifz?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n1. Good and Evil is almost everywhere in the world. As Muslims, we are bound to support good and condemn evil to the best of our ability. We condemn the unjust killing of any human being, be it Muslims or non-Muslims. The sanctity of life is the cornerstone of Islam.\n\nThe greatest sacrifice for Muslims in this age is to practice on all the tenets of Islam and be steadfast on that against all odds. Muslims should inculcate in them good character and express that to all Muslims and non-Muslims, especially ones neighbours and colleagues. Let them witness who a true Muslim is. We should not run away from adverse situations. Stay within and practice Islam. That will yield positive results. Roses emerge from within thorny stems. While we abhor the physical death of human beings, we cannot turn a blind eye to our spiritual death. That has to be rekindled through education and knowing our values and propagating that. Muslims are condemned today because of being ignorant of Islam and not knowing their values. They thus do not live by their true convictions. Should that be the case, the non-Muslims will see the real Islam and respect Muslims.\n\nToday we are facing the consequences of out own shortcomings. The solution is for us to honestly reflect and adjust positively.Â \n\n2. If you cannot to both Hifz and Nawaafil, then give preference to Hifz.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
