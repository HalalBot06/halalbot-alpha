  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalaam Alaikum,\n \nI have two questions to ask:-\n \n\n\n1) I work in office, Can i read the Holy Quran with purity but without wadhu and without touching the holy book example : reading Quran on monitor (computer)\n \n2) For a lady if the mensturation is not over after seven days (i.e. it continues 10 to 15 days with mideium or very light flow) Can she continue fasting and praying salah. Kindly let her know , she wants to pray,read quran and fast in this holy month of ramadan as much as we can which Allah (SWT) has gifted us this year. Please help us..please advice.\n\n\n \nMay Allah (SWT) shower his blessings upon you all and give you all more strenght for this good job you are doing for the muslim ummah.(AMMEEN)\n \nRemember in your dua`a \nFEEAMANALLAH\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\n1. Reading Qur’ān in the state of wudhū will be liable for extra reward. However, you can read without touching the text on the screen.\n\n2. It will depend on the normal habit of a woman. For example, a woman used to bleed 7 days every month. Thereafter in a particular month she bleed for (even a moment) more than 10 days and ten nights then all those days which are more than her normal period will regarded as Istihādhah. And she will have to make qadhā of her salāh and fasts for these days.\n\n (Bahisti Zewar, Pg.98 Zam Zam)\n\nKindly clarify if you have no fixed period.\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl. Abduz Zaman,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nConcured by:\n\n \n\nMl. Abdur Rahman Shareef,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nDārul Iftā"
