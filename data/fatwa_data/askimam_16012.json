  "question": "Is it allowed to do Qurbani in another Country?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\na) Is it allowed to do Qurbani (i.e. take Kurbani shares) in another country,even though it is mentioned in traditions that it is best for the persons doing the Qurbani to be at the site of  the slaughtering of the animal or something to this effect.          \nb) Since the Qurbani should be done after Eid salaah, what is the situation in doing Qurbani in another country when Eid ul Adha in that country take place  before I pray Eid salaah in my country .\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\na) It is mustahab (preferable) for the person doing qurbani to slaughter the animal with his own hands. If one is unable to do so, he should atleast be present in the place where the qurbani is done. It has been mentioned in Ahadith that Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) addressed Fathimah (Radhiyallahu Anhu) and said, “be present in the place where your qurbani is done, for your past sins will be forgiven in lieu to every drop of blood of qurbani”; and Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) further clarified that this ruling is not exclusively for the Ahlul Bait, but it is general for all Muslims.\n\nMoreover, it is also mustahab (preferable) to eat from the meat of the qurbani, and to have the first meal of the day of Eid from that meat, if possible.  \n\nHowever, if someone is not able to be present at the place of qurbani due to some unavoidable circumstances, then it will be permissible for him to have the qurbani done elsewhere. Sometimes the qubani made in another place or country might be more virtuous, depending on intention of the person.\n\nFatawa Raheemiyah Vol.10 Pg.28 (Darul Isha’at)\n\nb) If one is having his qurbani done in another country, then the country where the qurbani is taking place will be taken into consideration. The country where the person is present will not be taken into consideration.\n\nFatawa Raheemiyah Vol.10 Pg.40 (Darul Isha’at)\n\nTherefore, the qurbani can be made in the other country on the day of Eid in that country, even if it is one day before the day of Eid in your country.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
