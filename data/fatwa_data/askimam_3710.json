  "answer": "QUESTION\nMufti saheb Assalam-o-Alaikum. Mufti saheb Assalam-o-Alaikum. Please interpret mz dream islam.I saw: It is around 1 to 2 pm.I finish my work in kitchen and come to bedroom (as usual).My husband and both sons are already asleep.(elder son is quarter to 3 years and younger is 4 months old).My brother-in-law also comes there to take his blanket and pillow (it's dailyu routine).Suddenly shutter of our window rolls upwards(opens).We see outside are clouds and a pale yellow light(even at night).Fast wind blows to move our curtains and we hear in loud voice someone recites\"Innallaha....\"(i can't remember ayat).And at that moment we all 3 adults realize that it is dooms day(qiyamat).Then I wake up trembling with fear and regret.I'm still disturbed and want you to interpret it and tell some du'aa.Jayaakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream is to conscientise you of the reality of the day of Qiyaamat. You should always be conscious of the day of Qiyaamat and in particular your own death as the death of every individual is his/her Qiyaamat. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Whosoever dies, his Qiyaamat has come.'\n\nRemembering death and the day of Qiyaamat decreases the love of this world and motivates one to be straight, upright and gain closeness to Allah Ta'ala by being obedient to Him.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
