  "question": "I'm a new convert to Islam. my mom. She always said ISLAM is bad, #*@()$*)@(#*$ ISLAM is this and ISLAM is that",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI'm a new convert to Islam. Alhamdoeliah. Islam is all I'm looking for. Alhamdoeliah. However I have a lot of troubles with my family. Especially my mom. She's a hart patient and has high blood pleasure, she's very i'll. And she cry's and fights with me all the time, every time when i listen to quran recitations or read the quran myself. She's on high douses of medication, so that tells about her condition. She's from orgin hindu, so am I and my father. The fights distinguish from mental to physicaly at least, hand struggling, today just this morning I had a fight with her, I was listening to yusuf islam, and she came barging in, and started to smash the audio boxes. I interacted, and tried to keep her away from it, she said I should turn it of, I said no, i want to listen to it, and so I turned it on. So she turned it off again, and started being aggressive, so I wanted to calm her down, i put my hand on her shoulder and she starts making fists and hiting with her fists on my hands(the hands on the shoulder). I put her out of my room, harsh and harmfully, after a view minutes I started to feel bad about my actions towards my mother. I went to look for her, I found her in the bathroom, brushing her teeth, and all I saw was blood coming from her mouth, and she was crying. I stand there for a while and asked her, what happened, she said the medicine and YOU.\n\nA month ago\n\nShe always said ISLAM is bad, #*@()$*)@(#*$ ISLAM is this and ISLAM is that. So I talked and talked about islam with them, the situation calmed down for a while. Suddenly I found out she had conversations with her brother(my uncle) she was asking for help, he told her he couldn't do a thing for her. A view days later he called her up again, he said, he was sitting with his family in the train and a boy came up to them, giving them a card, and said to them of a physic man, he explained what happened to him, and how this man saved him. He gave them the card and said to them, give it to the person that needs it the most. So he gave it to my mom. My mom, as she has told me after the whole thing happened. She said, I heard of this man before, a lady at my work talked about him to. So she made a trick, to get me over there, I wasn't even aware of what was going on that time, however, she told me she knew a man that could help her out of her illnesses and she said, tell no one about this man or else the cure won't work, so the next day I went with her to that man, and surprise surprise it was ment for me.\n\nThe guy started talking and knew what I did in PRE-ISLAMIC time, the bad things, that no one knew, not even my mother, no one. He told me about my features about my choices. One that I would finish university, get married, have a great life, loving wife If I would not interact with islam. If I would interact with ISLAM then I would get married, have children go on haj, become a imam and die by killing myself in a struggle in the feature. The conversation scared me a lot. So this is what happening, my mom things ISLAM is bad for me, and he confirmed it.\n\nI told everyone how i feel about ISLAM, and how the salat made me feel, and how the quran could not be the word from god. It's all so clear in my head.\n\nI'm afraid that my mom will turn worse. If such a thing happen a lot of people will blame me, hate me, my whole family would. I had argues with them to about ISLAM. And my parents want me now to return to that man to talk once more.\n\n \n\nI don't know what to do right now, all I know that I'm hurting a lot of people, and I care a lot for my mom, a lot. As I told before I come from a hindu family, and it's where family is verry imported, and the mother is verry high in status. Also in ISLAM i noticed, like the profet Muhammad(pbuh) told us.\n\nI'm desperately and I would appreciate some good advice.\n\nshukran && wasalaam\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah Ta’ala states in the Qur’aan, ‘Verily the religion chosen by Allah is the religion of Islam.’ (Aale Imraan)\n\n‘And those who follow Islam (the Muslims) are chosen by Allah. As a Muslim, one should be grateful to Allah for choosing him to be a Muslim. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] was told by Allah on the day of Arafaat, ‘Today have I perfected for you your religion, completed my favours upon you and I am pleased with Islam as your religion.’ (Maaidah) Islam is the best religion and the only religion that will be accepted by Allah.\n\nIslam gave honour and victory to the Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhum] who used to do the worst of all evils. Islam made them shine and become the best people. Umar [radhiallaahu anhu] said, ‘We are a nation that Allah has honoured through Islam.’ Lucky indeed are those who have been guided to follow the religion of Islam. Islam is not only a religion, but a complete way of life that guides us in every aspect of our life. Islam has taught us how to fulfil the rights of Allah and the rights of all creation.\n\nAllah states, ‘Your Lord has ordered that you worship none besides Him and do good to your parents. If one or both of them attain old age, do not tell them uff, neither scold them but say unto them words of respect.’ As a matter of fact, it is Allah who gives existence to the child. Therefore, we have been ordered to worship Allah only and the parents are the external means to His creation. That is why in many of the Aayaats, the rights of the parents are described after the obligations to Allah. One Hadith states that Jannah is under the feet of the mother. In another Aayat, Allah states, ‘If they (your parents) force you to ascribe partners to Me of which you have no knowledge, then do not obey them but cordially associate with them in this world.’ (Luqmaan 15)\n\nChildren must obey and respect their parents. However, they must not be obeyed when they issue an instruction against Allah’s command. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said that the creation (irrespective of who it is) must not be obeyed when they command the disobedience to the Creator. Nevertheless, Allah says ‘Cordially associate with them in this world. A Muslim must always serve his/her parents even though they may be Kuffaar.’\n\nIslam is a wonderful religion that gives everyone a fair chance. When a disbeliever accepts Islam then all his past sins, i.e. whatever evil was committed in pre-Islamic times, are all forgiven and wiped off. And when a person starts a new life free from all sins a new born baby.\n\nA Muslim should be steadfast in his obedience to Allah in every condition. He should practice his religion and not impose it on anyone. Rather, he should be kind and compassionate to his family and relatives thereby winning their hearts. One should not do anything that will increase the hatred for Islam that already exist between family members. Having good character towards them, speaking to them politely, tolerating their abusive speech and making du’aa for them will only benefit them and they will slowly begin to love Islam.\n\nRemember, no one except Allah knows the future. He knows everything that will happen to a person. The good and bad is in the knowledge of Allah only. The information of fortune tellers is full of lies and one should not be affected by them. You should be steadfast in practicing Islam and be kind and good to your parents and other family members and make du’aa for them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
