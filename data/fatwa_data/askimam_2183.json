  "question": "A friend of mine like to name his newborn son as \"Ahad bin Asif\".",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe word 'Ahad' is the first number of the numerical order which means One.\n\nIn the context of defining Allah Ta'ala, it means Allah is One and He has no\npartner. It is incorrect to name anyone Ahad as it is the sole quality of\nAllah Ta'ala.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
