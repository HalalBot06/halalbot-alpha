They are tried and tested by people. One may follow the practices and experiences of people on condition one does not regard them to be compulsory in Shariah. If one regards such acts as compulsory in Shariah, it will be an act of bidah.\n\n \n\nبِسمِ اللهِ الَّذِى لا اِلهَ الا هُوَ ارَّحمنُ الرَّحِيم اَلهّمَّ اذهَب عَنِّي اَلهَمَّ وَ الحُزنَ\n\n \n\nThe practice of reciting the dua Allahuma Izhab… while placing the hand on the forehead is proven in the hadith. The complete dua is : Bimillahil Lazi La Ilaaha Illa Huwar Rahmaanur Raheem. Allahuma Izhab Anni AlHamma Wal Huzn.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
