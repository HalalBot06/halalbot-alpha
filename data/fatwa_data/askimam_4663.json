Are you allowed to eat French Fries, Cofee, Fish, ice cream etc. from an American managed and own place as long as there is not any non-halal item in there?? OR Does these items also has to be from a place own by Muslim. Only managed/employee working there or also own by Muslim? 2. As u said that one should recite durood 500 times a day, does it matter which durood one should read... i knoe this shortest dursood called 'Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam' and then i knoe the other durood that isn't as short as this one so is it okie to read the short one or is it better to read the longer one?? thank you for the answers. May Allah bless you and your family!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We are ordered to exercise extreme precaution in the consumption of\nHalaal and abstaining from Haraam. Fish is Halaal and so too is milk, but we\nhave heard of non-Muslim food outlets spinkling alcohol in sea-foods and\nice-ream for flavouring.\nIf the non-Muslim outlet is managed by a Muslim who has sound knowledge of\nHalaal and Haraam and is upright and sensitive to matters of Deen, then one\nmay trust his advise in the non-Muslim outlet under his management. He\nshould not be a person who and wishes to advance the course of the company\nat the expenses of compromising in Halaal and Haraam.\n2. You may recite the Durood mentioned by you.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
