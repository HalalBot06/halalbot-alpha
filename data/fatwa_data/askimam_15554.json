  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1- is having a online chat is consider zenya.. even if u werent talkin about somethin bad... making friendship.... i mean its not like ur hearing there voice or seening there pics.. vise versa.\n\n2-  is day dreaming about sex is haram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1. It is not permissible to engage in a general online chat with the opposite gender. It is human nature to be attracted to the opposite gender. Curiosity is also a sensitive instinct in a person. If a male chats with a female, the above mentioned two factors will feature prominently in his communication with the female counterpart. He will gradually get attracted to her and his curiosity about her will unleash a host of attractions towards her. What’s supposed to be a general online discussion is now a jailbird of desires locked in a secure prison of Shaitaan and fitna. Allah says, “And do not go close to zina, it is immoral.” The online chats is a road to zina and therefore prohibited.\n2. Day dreaming of all evil and immoral acts is prohibited.\n\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
