  "question": "are there any situations in which a Muslim should not smile or be very warm in his greeting his brother; or which would warrant one showing another a smileless face?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMany people when they meet one another, do not greet one another very warmly (i.e. smile in one another's face). It is awkward especially in light of the fact the Prophet (sallAllahu 'alayhi wa sallam) would smile to his Sahaba (radhiAllahu 'anhum) very often. They make people feel by their rather distant greeting that the person they are greeting has done something wrong or that they (the person being greeted) are not worthy of their attention so they look at them very arrogantly (i.e. \"who is this person smiling at me\").\n\n \n\nIn this regards Sheikh, are there any situations in which a Muslim should not smile or be very warm in his greeting his brother; or which would warrant one showing another a smileless face?\n\n \n\nAlso, when sitting with a teacher of Shari'ah, is it part of the sunna to keep a constant gaze fixed at the face of the teacher when he is teaching you; or can one look down and up periodically?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are no instances or circumstances in which a Muslim should not smile or be warm with his greeting of another Muslim. In fact, a Muslim should smile and outwardly be warm with a non-Muslim also. This is from Akhlaaq (good character) which Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] laid great stress upon. The master has mentioned that nobody should feel any good action to be insignificant, even the meeting of one’s Muslim brother with a smiling face.\n\nThere is no hard and fast rule or Sunnah as such, as to where a person should fix his gaze when sitting in the presence of a teacher of Shari’ah. One may do what suits one. However, it will be advisable to gaze at the teacher as much as possible so that he may grasp what is being taught quicker.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
