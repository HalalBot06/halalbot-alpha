  "answer": "QUESTION\nAA Mufti Saab. Is it permissible to say ?Inshallah, mashallah, astaghfiruallah? etc in your HEART while relieving onself, seated on a toilet seat??? I say the above as thoughts race through my head while on the toilet seat and as a habit I keep saying ?inshallah, mashallah? to things and ideas in my head. What should one do when you find yourself saying the above (in your heart)while relieving???? Is it permissible etc? Jazak Allah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is prohibited to verbally make any form of zikr, in the toilet. If any\nform of zikr involuntarily comes to the mind and heart, the person will not\nbe accountable for that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
