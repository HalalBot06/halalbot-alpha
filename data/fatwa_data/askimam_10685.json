  "question": "Problem is that my friend’s parents want to marry him with a girl whom he doesn’t want and he does not want to marry there.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAOA There is a problem with my friend, he told me and gave me permission to consult with you. Problem is that my friend?s parents want to marry him with a girl whom he doesn?t want and he does not want to marry there. His family members also want to marry him there where he doesn?t want. Whenever his family members ask him to marry there he refuses. Now he wants to know that what he should do, weather to marry a girl where he doesn?t want or to do against his parents. He told me ?whenever I think to marry her I get dishearten and once I was so dishearten that I did DUA for my death. I said to my family members to marry me at any other place where they want but not there?. Kindly tell a solution of this problem according to Islam. May Allah give you shadow under His ARSH.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari?ah, you are an adult and you have the independent right to marry a person of your choice.\n\nYou may consider the feelings of your family members but if you feel as you had expressed in the details of your query, then you will defeat the purpose of marriage if you proceed with the marriage merely to please family members. You may not fulfil the rights of your wife.\n\nWe suggest you identify a person of your choice and make a decision based on Istikhaara.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
