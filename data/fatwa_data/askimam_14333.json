  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have received this forwarded message about Prophet's food. There are no references available. Would you please comment on them whether they are authentic Hadith. Jazak Allah Khair.\n \nSubject:   Prophet's food\n \n\nVinegar:\nA food Prophet Muhammad (SAW) used to eat with olive oil. [That's now a fashion in expensive Italian Restaurants]\n \nMilk:\nThe Prophet (SAW) said that milk wipes away heat from the heart just as the finger wipes away sweat from the brow. It strengthens the back, improved the brain, renews vision and drives away forgetfulness.\n \nHoney:\nConsidered to be the best remedy for diarrhoea when mixed in hot water. It is the food of foods, drink of drinks and drug of drugs. It is used for creating appetite, strengthening the stomach, eliminating phlegm; as a meat preservative, hair conditioner, eye salve and mouthwash. It is extremely beneficial in the morning in warm water and is also a Sunnah.\n \nOlive oil:\nExcellent treatment for skin and hair, delays old age, and treats inflammation of the stomach.\n \nMushroom:\nThe Prophet (SAW) said that mushroom is a good cure for the eyes, it also serves as a form of birth control and arrests paralysis.\n \nGrapes:\nThe Prophet (SAW) was very fond of grapes - it purifies the blood, provides vigour and health, strengthens the kidneys and clears the bowels.\n \nDates:\nThe Prophet (SAW) said that a house without dates has no food and also to be eaten at the time of childbirth.\n \nFigs:\nIt is a fruit from paradise and a cure for piles.\n \nBarley:\nGood for fever in a soup form.\n \nMelon:\nThe Prophet (SAW) said: \"None of your women who are pregnant and eat of water melon will fail to produce off spring who are good in countenance and good in character.\"\n \nPomegranate:\nThe Prophet (SAW) said it cleanses you of Satan and evil aspirations for 40 days.\n \nWater:\nThe Prophet (SAW) said the best drink in this world and the next is water, when you are thirsty drink it by sips and not gulps, gulping produces sickness of the liver.\n \nSo praise be to our beloved Nabi (SAW) who related us with marvelous knowledge which dazzles the wisest minds. May this information be beneficial to all of us Insha'Allah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe majority of these ahadith are not reliable.\n\nMany Muhaddithin (masters in Hadith) have stated that the ahadith mentioned on the benefits of fruits like the melon, pomegranate etc are all unreliable or even fabricated.(Kashful Khafaa 1/278,1/423, al-Manar an-Munif Pg.128)\n\nIt is proven that Nabi (sallalahu alaihi wasallam) ate the majority of the items mentioned, however the specific benefits mentioned for most of these items are not proven from sound Ahadith.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Husain Kadodia\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
