  "answer": "QUESTION\na) some people in our house consider face veiling (and purdah in general) from ghair mahrams to be restricted to Iddah period only, is this correct? b) what is the Sharai' ruling on a person who ridicules the Islamic dress code? or any other 'fundamental' of Islam? c) is it permissible to greet ghair mahram women with salam ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) An adult female is required to cover her face in front of Ghayr Mahram (not prohibited in marriage) males at all times, during Iddat and out of Iddat.\n\n2) If any person ridicules any law of the Shari?ah,, that is expressly and explicitly mentioned in the Qur?aan and authentic Ahaadith, then he risks his Imaan. There is a fear of such a person losing his/her Imaan.\n\n3) If there is a fear of Fitnah, it is not permissible to make Salaam with Ghayr Mahram woman.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
