  "question": "Can i make Salaam to a girl whom i dont know",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ncan iÂ  salaam to a girl whom i dont know\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIn order to understand the shari ruling on this, it is important to understand two things.\n\na)Shariah has emphasized on making salam and pronounced great rewards for making salam.\n\nb)Shariah has closed all doors leading to fitna and immorality.\n\nIf one is faced with a situation of making salam and there is no fear of fitna and immoralities, then one should make salam and earn the great rewards of making salam.\n\nHowever, if one is faced with a situation of making salam and one fears that making salam may lead to some evils, for example getting close to a young girl etc., then one should not make salam. The reason is obvious. When a young boy and girl establish contact with each other, then that may lead them to commit evil and immoral acts.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
