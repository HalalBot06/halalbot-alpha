Firstly that of the Caste system that is inculcalted in our lives. I am \"memon\" and want to marry an \"urdu\" girl. You probably hear this alot. My mum refuses to get me married to her. she told me if she does, she will disown me. I showed her that is wrong islamically. I have gone through great lengths in trying to show her what this girl means to me. My brothers wont help me. I am trapped and find myself commiting zina. I find myself depressed and stressed.My mum tells me that moulanas and muftis will tell me to marry because the moulanas are not in the position she is. My dad passed away when i was 2yrs old and she was diagnoised with cancer last year.I have now way out. please moulana contact my mum. if i make her read emails she wont listen.PLEASE HELP\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nYou may contact me by telephone at the Darul Ifta on 031 785 1239.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
