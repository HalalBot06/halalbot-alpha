  "question": "What is the difference between Nafil Salat and Sunnah Salat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI read in a book that there is a limitation of how many Nafil and Sunnah prayers you can say between Fard prayers......but I dont know what the difference is between Sunnah Salat and Nafil Salat. Please provide an example if you can inshaAllah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two types of Sunnahs.\n\nSunnat-e-Muakkadah (emphasized Sunnats), for example, the two Rakaats before Fajr Salaat, four Rakaats before Dhuhr Salaat, two Rakaats after Maghrib Salaat. It is a sin not to perform these Sunnats.\n\nSunnat-e-Ghayr Muakkadah (not emphasized), for example, the four Rakaats before Esha Salaat. If one does not perform these Salaats, he will not be sinful. Nafl means extra or voluntary. It refers to every Salaat which is not necessary to perform but meritorious, for example, Tahajjud Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
