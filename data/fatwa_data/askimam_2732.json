  "question": "Forced marriages and parents",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n(Refer to 2655 and 2707) What I meant by force is, exactly what one can imagine when this word is used anywhere. Obviously she did not independently consent to the marriage, instead she has clearly REFUSED to it. Her father who is a very stubborn person got furious over this and has threatened to kill her if she does not obey him. Under this condition what do you expect her to do? My question (2655) is not only my personal question, but it represents the many people involved in such cases. I need everyone to be aware that Islam does not support parents to take advantage of the respect their children give them by staying silent!, They do not have the authority to force their adult child\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nIf a female was compelled to consent to marriage due to fear of being\nkilled, the marriage will be invalid.\n\nThe father is guilty of depriving his daughter of her independent right to\nchoose her marriage partner.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
