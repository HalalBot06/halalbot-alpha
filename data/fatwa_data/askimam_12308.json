  "answer": "QUESTION\nI heard that it is makrooh to say salam when entering the masjid but in the masjid where I go, people (including the imam) are not happy with me as I don't say salam to everyone when I enter. Usually it is either before the salat or during the class which would be going on there. Is it appropriate to disturb the class by saying salam to everyone?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf people are engaged in salah, zikr, or lessons etc and making salaam would disturb them, then you should not make salaam to them.(Imdaadul Fatawa Vol.4 Pg. 278, Jaamiul Fatawaa Vol.1 Pg.541)\n\nYes, if they would take offence to you not greeting them in that situation and do not mind being disturbed, then you should greet them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl.
