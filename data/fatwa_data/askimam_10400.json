In future, you should exercise caution on how you respond to such issues.\n\nAs regards the stolen candy, you have committed a major sin. You should seek sincere repentance to Allah and also replace the candy to your teacher. There is no need to inform her that you stole her candy. You may offer the candy to her as a gift. Do not repeat such a crime in future. Know well, Allah is All-Seeing.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
