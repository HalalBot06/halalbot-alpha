  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMe and my friends went outside for a walk one day. We went to this field near our house and we sat in different poses and took pictures from my friend's phone. The field was very big and hardly anyone were there, however, there were a few people. The people didn't care what we were doing, they were doing their own thing. We were all girls, in which only two of them wore hijab. The age group ranged from 10 - 14. We came home shortly after 30 minutes. I want to know why this is not appropriate and how we should prevent ourselves from doing this. Is this permissable for girls to do this without an older guardian? Was this something we could have easily prevented?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nYou state “I want to know why this is not appropriate and how we should prevent ourselves from doing this.” Their could be two possibilities to your query:\n\nFirstly, one should understand that Sharia does not permit taking pictures of animate objects. One should abstain from this, as there are extremely severe warnings in the Ahaadith regarding picture making and keeping them in ones possession.\n\nRefrence: Sahih Al Muslim Vol: 14 Pg: 309-319 (Darul Ma’rifah, Beirut)\n\nSecondly, In these times of fitna and corruption girls should not leave the confines of one’s home without proper hijab. If one has to leave the home for some reason then one should observe the laws of hijab.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
