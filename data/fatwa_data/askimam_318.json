  "question": "How should tarbiyyah between sons and daughters differ, especially when they are naughty?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy daughters are 3 and 5 and my son is 1 yrs old.My mother recomends that you should never shout or hit your daughters. However on the rare occasion that I have hit them when they're extremely naughty then they have refrained from that particular naughty act in the future.My wife usually says that she should be the sole punisher however I believe that my contribution every so often greatly improves their tarbiyyah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen children are naughty and the only solution to reform them is hitting\nthem, parents should not hit them in the state of anger as the intention of\nhitting them may be to cool off their anger.\n\nSuch an intention will defeat the purpose of hitting, being reformation. It\nis suggested that parents in the state of anger exercise tolerance by\ncontaining their anger until it subsides. Thereafter, create an impression\nof anger and hit the child. Hitting the child with the proper intention will\nrealise the desired effect.\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
