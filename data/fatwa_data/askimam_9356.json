  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)is it true that having a big stomach is going against the sunnat of Nabi(SAW)as his stomach never went out more than his chest?? 2) I noticed that many great Aalims in our vicinity are driving very flashy cars ,is this not against the Sunnat of Nabi ( SAW) who didnt like extravagance..3) Is it true that in Ramadaan the portal of the heavens are opened and the positive energy of ALlah is relaesed to the 4 corners of the world.4) What is your ruling about Musalees who make iftaar in the mosque but expect the muezzin to clean up after them...5) Is the word beard mentioned in the Quran...\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Sometimes a sickness causes the stomach to enlarge and sometimes excessive eating causes it. If a person eats a lot and he uses the energy in the path of Allah and the upliftment of Deen, e.g. Tabligh, Jihad and other ways by means of which Deen can be propagated, then this will not be regarded as going against the Sunnah. (Fataawaa Aalamgeeriyyah, Vol. 5, Page 336). %0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) having a stomach in line with his chest was one of his specialties. Not every individual can live up to that. Abu Hurairah (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said that: ?A strong Believer is better and dearer to Allah than a weak one.? (Mishkaat, Page 452, Riyadhus Saaliheen, Page 42)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. A Hadith states that the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said that: ?Allah loves to see the signs of His bounties on His slave.? (Riyadhus Saaliheen, Page 241) In light of the above Hadith, if Allah Ta?ala has endowed a person with wealth then owning a good car will not be regarded as extravagance. However, one should not exceed his standards and it should not create pride and arrogance in the heart. (Fataawaa Aalamgeeriyyah, Vol. 5, Page 359) %0D%0A%0D%0A3. Abu Hurairah (Radhiallaahu Anhu) states that the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said that: ?When Ramadaan begins, the gates of Paradise are opened, the gates of Hell are closed and the Shayaateen are chained.? A similar narration states that: ?The doors of mercy are open.? (Mishkaat, Page 173) %0D%0A%0D%0A4. It will not be appropriate to leave the Muezzin to clean up after making Iftaar in the Masjid if he is not paid or happy to do it. %0D%0A%0D%0A5. Allah Ta?ala says in the Qur?an: ?He said: \"O my mother's son! Do not seize my beard, nor my head. Indeed I fear that thou may say, that: \"You have caused a rift between Bani-Israeel and did not heed my word.? (Surah Ta-Ha, Verse 94) %0D%0A%0D%0AThe abovementioned verse indicates that other prophets before Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) also had beards to the length of at least one fist, otherwise Moosa (Alayhis salaam) would not have been able to seize Haroon (Alayhis salaam) by his beard.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Ashraf%0D%0ADARUL IFTA ?
