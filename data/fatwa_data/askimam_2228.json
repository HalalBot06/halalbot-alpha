  "question": "I wish to get married as soon as possible but my fiancee wishes to postpone the nikah date for 1 year. What should I do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWaiting for one year is unacceptable, it is fraught with many dangers.\n\nSince you will have to live with your wife and in-laws for the rest of your\nlife, the subject should be approached in a diplomatic manner applying\nwisdom. Ask the elders of your family to approach the elders of her family\nto negotiate an earlier date. If her family has a good relationship with any\nAalim, then approach this Aalim and explain your situation. Perhaps he may\nbe able to convince them to arrange an earlier time.\n\nMay Allah Ta'ala make it easy for you.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
