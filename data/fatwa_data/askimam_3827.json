  "answer": "QUESTION\nI saw huge , black clouds gathering in the sky , above the ocean. Can you tell me what this means?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRain: It symbolizes assistance and blessings. The same applies to seeing\nclouds. But if rain or clouds are seen confined to a particular place, house\nor vicinity, it symbolizes famine and sickness or some worldly loss which\nthe people of that place will suffer. In most cases, it symbolizes\ndifficulties and hardships which will afflict the people of that place.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
