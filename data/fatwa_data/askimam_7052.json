  "question": "Is it permissible to invest in the Oasis Crescent Equity Fund",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAre their funds Halaal and do they comply with Shariah? Would you advise that we invest with them?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe have had a direct meeting with the board of Oasis.\n\nAs yet, we are not satisfied that these funds are Shari'ah compliant. The board members themselves have distinctly displayed that they are still getting their act in order. Until we are not fully satisfied, we cannot declare investing in such funds to be Halaal.\n\nThe onus now lies with Oasis to dispel our misgivings which we have expressed, and convince us that all their transactions are above board. If this can be achieved, we would gladly declare investing in such funds as Halaal.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
