  "question": "Sufism part of Islam??",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaam.I would like to know why some people regard Sufism as something that is not part of Islam, and something that is wrong. They say that Sufis pray and seek help from the Awliya and saints when the only One they should be praying to is Allah. Please clarify...Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Over the years, a number of un-Islamic practices have seeped into Sufism.\nThis is why some people deny Sufism altogether.\n2. However, Sufism deals with spiritual reformation thereby gaining\nspiritual proximity to Allah. There is nothing wrong with this.\n3. The Sufis do not seek help from the Awliyaa. The grave-worshippers do\nthis. This is a form of Shirk.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
