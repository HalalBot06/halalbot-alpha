  "question": "Working for an IT company that mainly serves the medical aid industry...Is it permissible?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nA Muslim works for an IT company whose main and major source of income is providing an IT service to a Medical Aid administration compny who administers a number of Medical aid funds. The Muslim is involved in this work ofcourse. Is it permissible?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two aspects to your query, I) working in an IT company ii) conventional medical aid.\n\nIn principle, it is perfectly permissible to work for an IT company. However conventional medical aid schemes devolve around interest and gambling, hence not permissible. To work in an IT company serving a medical aid company will be assisting in sin. Almighty Allah Ta?ala says, and do not assist in sin (Maaida: 5).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
