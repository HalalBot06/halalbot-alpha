  "question": "Is masturbation only with hands? If one rubs his private parts without touching them, is it also considered as masturbating?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nwhile rubbing one does not think of any sexual things.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe reason for masturbation being prohibited is not just the use of the\nhands. It is due to adopting an unnatural way of satisfying ones carnal\ndesire. It is similar to fulfilling ones desire unnaturally through the same\ngender. Therefore, there is no difference in merely rubbing the private\nparts or using the hands.\n\nBoth are equally prohibited. Not having any evil thoughts does not effect\nthe prohibition. There is also a possibility that masturbation may turn out\nto be a habit and even an addiction. That may have a devastating effect in a\npersons marital intimate life.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
