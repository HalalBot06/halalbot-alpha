  "question": "How can I gain Full sincerity in all my actions of Worship especially Salaah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDearest Mufti Sahab, I hope you?re in the best of health inshallah. I am (alhumdulillah) blessed with a nice voice for recitation of Qur?an. However, people take note of that and then whenever I go to the Masjid with some of these people they always keep forcing me to lead the salaah . I am qualified in that I keep my beard and memorized the Qur?an however, I don?t like it when they do this because then (To Me) it seems like I have to ?put on a show ?for them in Namaz.. I don?t feel good when I do this because before the salaah I make my intention to read it for the sake of Allah(SWT) but I feel that my Ikhlas isn?t totally devoted for the pleasure Allah(SWT). Therefore what do you advise me to do in my situation and to attain FULL Ikhlas and Khushu in all my Ibadaaat and Mua?malaat, Especially my salaat?#2) When we say the zikr subhanallah, alhumdulillah, and allahuakbar 33,33,33 times after fard salaat, does it only have to be after the fard salaat or can I say it after sunnat or nafl as well for the same benefit? Jazkaalahu khair for your time and help. May Allah (SWT) reward you and all this website?s staff infinitely inshallah. Ameen. Assalaamualaikum.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlhamdulillah, you are very fortunate that Allah Ta?ala has given you three outstanding qualities:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. He has blessed you with the Qur?aan Kareem;%0D%0A%0D%0A2. He has given you a beautiful voice to recite it;%0D%0A%0D%0A3. You are such an individual who is loved by his community to such an extent that they are prepared to make you their leader for Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe virtues of the above qualities are impossible to complete on paper. However, the point to ponder upon is that if Allah is trying to use us for His noble Deen, why should we create a barrier and try to stop ourselves from serving Deen. Regarding the sincerity of our intention, we should check our intention before, during and after completing any action. If the above procedure is adopted then one should now hand over the judgment to Allah and remember that Allah does hold man responsible for that which he has power of. One Shaytaan?s method of diverting man away from good is to create doubt in his Ikhlaas (sincerity). We should, therefore, continue our action with constant monitoring of our intention to combat Shaytaan.%0D%0A%0D%0AZikr of Allah, i.e. Subhaanallah, Alhamdulillah and Allaahu Akbar after the Salaat is very virtuous. In some narrations, Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] mentioned, ?It should be recited before going to sleep.? One should remember Zikr of Allah has no specific time or place, the more one remembers Allah, the more he will be rewarded and his Jannah will be decorated. The specification of time, etc. in some Ahaadith are only to create a habit and pattern within man to remember Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AQari Ismail Abdul Aziz%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN QUR?AANIC SCIENCES AND RECITATIONS%0D%0A%0D%0Achecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)%0D%0A"
