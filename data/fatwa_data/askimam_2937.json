  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like to if the following story is a myth or reality? When Adam Alayhisalaam was created and Iblis was asked to prosterate before him he spat on him. Allah Talah then removed the clay he spat on from our prophet Adam and from that pice of clay a dog was created? I would also like to ask another question. My husband is a new muslim and he is wonderful. The only thing he cannot accept is not being able to have dogs. I know this is forbidden in Islam but as I am his wife I know I must respcet his wishes. What should i do on this matter as he can accept everything but this? He suggests keeping dogs in one part of the house only and not letting them in the room we pray. Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe have not come across the information of the creation of dogs mentioned in%0D%0Athe details of your question.%0D%0A%0D%0AKindly refer below our standard reply to similar queries.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AAll creatures are the creation of Allah Ta%E3la and do deserve the recognition%0D%0Aof being a creation of the Almighty. As much as Muslims detest even the%0D%0Asight of pigs - it is the creation of Allah Ta%E3la - and because Allah has%0D%0Aplaced life into it, we cannot inflict pain nor torture the pig.%0D%0A%0D%0ASimilarly Allah Ta%E3la created the dog from among His creation. This does not%0D%0Amean that we should love the dog. It is perhaps the indoctrination of the%0D%0AWestern culture that 'The dog is Man's best Friend'. The theory that 'dogs%0D%0Aare very dependent on Human affection' is a myth - again culture and custom%0D%0Ahas helped to develop this unnatural behaviour.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta%E3la the Creator of this Universe - having created the dog would%0D%0Asurely have known that the dog requires Human affection and love to exist in%0D%0Athis world. Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) would have advised us,%0D%0AMuslims, to keep dogs as pets. On the contrary, we are instructed not to%0D%0Akeep dogs as pets and 'love' them as exemplified by the non-Muslims.%0D%0ARemember our life is structured and bound by the Shariah i.e. The Noble%0D%0AQur%E3n and the beautiful example of Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam). Consider these Ahaadith:%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Talha (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam) said, \"Angels do not enter a house wherein there is a dog%0D%0Aor an animate picture. (Sahih Bukhari Hadith no. 2986)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhuma) reports from Hadhrat Maimoona%0D%0A(Radhiyallaahu %C1nha) that once Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)%0D%0Abecame sad; and said that Jibra'eel (%C1layhis Salaam) promised to meet him at%0D%0Anight but did not turn up. \"By Allah what has kept him back,\" said the%0D%0AProphet (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam). Then he realised a puppy was under%0D%0Ahis bed. He ordered that the puppy be removed and the area be sprinkled with%0D%0Awater. In the afternoon when Jibra'eel (%C1layhi Salaam) came, Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) enquired as to the delay. Jibra'eel (%C1layhi%0D%0ASalaam) said that we, the group of Angels do not enter a house wherein there%0D%0Ais a dog or pictures. (Sahih Muslim Hadith no.3928)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the light of these Ahaadith and other narrations it is not permissible to%0D%0Akeep dogs as pets. The household is deprived of the Mercy of Allah Ta%E3la.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, Jurists have stated that it is permissible to keep a dog, sell dogs%0D%0Aand rear them for security purposes, farming and hunting. (Fataawa%0D%0AMahmoodiyyah vol.8 pg.263)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe saliva of a dog is Najis (impure). If it touches the clothes or body,%0D%0Athat portion also becomes impure and must be washed.%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A"
