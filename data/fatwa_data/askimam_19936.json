Always show respect to one’s parents. Do not let your religiousness affect your relationship with your parents.\n\n \n\nAllah (Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala) says:\n\n \n\nو وصينا الانسان بوالديه احسانا\n\n \n\n“And we have enjoined upon Mankind showing compassion to parents” (Surah al- Ankaboot, chapter 29, verse 8)\n\n \n\n \n\nThe aforementioned verse clearly advocates the importance of showing respect to ones parents.\n\n \n\nAlways examine yourself when dealing with one’s parents to see whether you have violated this cardinal principle or not.\n\n \n\nRasullullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said:\n\n \n\nفَالْزَمْهَا، فَإِنَّ الْجَنَّةَ تَحْتَ رِجْلَيْهَا\n\n“Hold firmly onto her, for verily Jannah lies under the feet of the mother”. (Sunan al- Nasa’ie, Vol.6, Pg.11, Al- Matboo’aath al – Islamiyyah, second edition, 1406)\n\n \n\n \n\nYou state that your anger with your mother is gambling.\n\n \n\nShariah emphasises one to look at the sin and not the sinner, By looking at the faults of others, Takabbur(pride) and Ujb (vanity/conceit) slowly breeds within the Nafs of a person. Thereafter, these diseases give way to anger, hatred, malice, hasad e.t.c making it difficult for one to control the Nafs.\n\n \n\nExplain to your mother the importance of obeying the dictates of the Shariah.\n\n \n\nIt may be a good idea to contact a Social Support centre where they might help your mother with her problem.\n\n \n\nCertain countries offer gambling rehabilitation centres, you may contact them for help.\n\n \n\nIt may be a good idea to obtain some booklets on the harms and ill effects of gambling and keep it within close proximity of your mother.\n\n \n\nEmploy Hikmah (wisdom) when dealing with one’s parents. Always be diplomatic in your approach towards your parents. You might have the right objective and aim in mind, but the method of conveying the message across maybe totally incorrect and not suitable to the situation. Always deploy wisdom when dealing with such serious matters.\n\n \n\nBe diplomatic and tactful in your approach towards your mother and try to win her over rather than trying to force her into leaving the sin of gambling.\n\n \n\nYou state that you pushed them to give you money and they sold their house.\n\n \n\nWe are unaware of the full background regarding the above issue in reference; therefore we cannot comment on the specifics of the issue in reference.\n\n \n\nNevertheless, if you disobeyed or disrespected your parents during the entire episode in reference, then you have committed a major sin for which Tawba and Istighfaar is necessary.\n\n \n\nIf you did not disobey nor disrespect your parents during the entire episode, you are not at fault and did not commit any sin.\n\n \n\nAlways keep the pleasure and respect of your parents a priority in life. By doing so, you will earn the ultimate pleasure of Allah (Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala).\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best.\n\n \n\nIsmail Desai\n\nDurban, South Africa\n\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\n \n\nChecked and Concurred\n\nMoulana Faraz Ibn Adam\n\nLeicester, UK\n\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nDaruliftaa.net"
