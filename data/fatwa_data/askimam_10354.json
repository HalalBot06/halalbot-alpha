  "question": "i am engaged with a girl who is non-mahram to me. is it permissible to do so? we dont do emails to eachother or we just write \"i love you\" to eachother",
  "answer": "QUESTION\ni am engaged with a girl who is namehram to me. we met, once or twice, 2 years ago. after that we haven't met till now. she is in pakistan and i am out of country. we have contact through email (no phone calls), for frequent reply we do textchat a little. she informs me about other proposals she is having and what her parents are thinking about those proposals. it helps me alot in taking any step. otherwise, we dont do emails to eachother or we just write \"i love you\" to eachother. is it permissible to do so? moreover, i have sent my proposal to her parents. now our so called relation sounds like secure and we hope that we'll make it (insha allah), and allah does the best.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, it is not permissible to have any contact with a Ghayr Mahram\n(not prohibited in marriage) girl before marriage. If you are inclined\ntowards the girl, and you have sent in your proposal, wait for the response.\nIf it is favourable, then arrangements for marriage should be made.\n\nIf the response is not favourable, then do not keep any contact with the\ngirl. Search for your life and marriage partner elsewhere.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
