  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am confused by the two different fatwas you gave on shaving pubic hear. In one 11324 dated April 14, 2004 you mentioned:\n\nThe hair on the penis does not have to be removed. Only the pubic hair which is just above the private parts below the navel has to be removed.\n\nWhereas in fatwa 12034 dated June 29, 2004 you mention:\n\nOne has to shave the scrotum and the hair around it as well.\n\nBy hind parts is meant the circle around the anus, as it is very likely that faeces could get attached to any hair present there. (Raddul Muhtaar Vol.2 Pg.481-H.M.Saeed, Tahtaawi alal Maraaqi Pg.527-Ilmiyyah, Fathul Bari Vol.10 Pg.343)\n\nI am confused by the apparent contradiction that should I remove only pubic hear just above the private parts below the navel or remove every bit of hair down there including on the scrotum and around the anus (which will be a bit difficult).\n\nPlease clarify...\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1.      The Fuqahaa have mentioned that it is necessary to remove the pubic hair that appears above the private parts as well as that hair that appears immediately surrounding the private parts and the hair that is found on the private part itself.\n\nوَالْمُرَاد ( بِالْعَانَةِ ) الشَّعْر الَّذِي فَوْق ذَكَرِ الرَّجُل وَحَوَالَيْهِ ، وَكَذَاك الشَّعْر الَّذِي حَوَالَيْ فَرْج الْمَرْأَة ،\n\n(Sharah al-Nawawi ala Muslim Vol. 3-4 Pg. 140 Darul Ma`rifah)\n\nTherefore it will be necessary to remove the hair that is found on the scrotum, the penis and the area immediately surrounding them.\n\n2.      If the hair around the anus can be removed without difficulty, then it is highly preferable to do so.\n\n وَنُقِلَ عَنْ أَبِي الْعَبَّاس بْن سُرَيْج أَنَّهُ الشَّعْر النَّابِت حَوْل حَلْقَة الدُّبُر ، فَيَحْصُل مِنْ مَجْمُوع هَذَا اِسْتِحْبَاب حَلْق جَمِيع مَا عَلَى الْقُبُل وَالدُّبُر وَحَوْلهمَا\n\n(Sharah al-Nawawi ala Muslim Vol. 3-4 Pg. 140)\n\n ويستحب إزالة شعر الدبر خوفا من أن يعلق به شيء من النجاسة الخارجة\n\n(Tahtaawi ala Maraaqi al- Falaah Pg. 527 Ilmiyyah)\n\n* We have reviewed our rulings, and have confirmed fatwa 12034. We will make the necessary change in fatwa 11324.\n\n And Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Abdul Hameed,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
