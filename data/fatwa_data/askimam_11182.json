  "answer": "QUESTION\nhad seen a dream where i was going in a train with my old classmates and the train had passed through a ball which threw a spectrum of lights and there were many color lights which we wear happy to see and it made the daylight look different but at one color my classmates and i become extremely happy and we saw \"we are so lucky to have seen the color voilet during this day in our lifetime\" (i dont know for sure if i saw the color voilet but i remember very well that the name of the color was color voilet). Can you tell me what this dream or the color voilet means??\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nEvery human being is travelling the journey of life (train) to the grave and hereafter. His travel in this world is with people of different backgrounds (classmates).\n\nThe success of one?s journey in this world and the hereafter is in following the Deen of Allah, and advising one?s friends and colleagues about following the Deen of Allah. This is the true and the real colour of happiness.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
