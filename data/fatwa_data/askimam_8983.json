It is not permissible to take out a life insurance policy.\n\n2. It is not permissible to work in an interest bearing institute as that will be aiding in sin. If the major source of the bank is Haraam, for example, interest, etc. then the wages will also be Haraam. If the major source of income is not Haraam, then the wages will be Makrooh. The ruling can also change due to an individual?s circumstances which must be referred to a reliable Mufti for a Shar?ee ruling.\n\n3. If the sole major source of the insurance campany?s income is through the insurance premiums, then the salary will not be Halaal.\n\n4. If any insurance is private or commercial follow the principles of conventional insurance schemes, it will not be permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
