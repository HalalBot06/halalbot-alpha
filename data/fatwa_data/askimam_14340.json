We have thus far been unable to locate such a Hadith.\n\n2. Our advise is that you first portray the beautiful characteristics of Islam to them. This could be done in your general interaction with them. This will gradually attract them towards Islam, Insha Allah. If they are awar of you being a Muslim at present, it would be easier. Also, constantly make du’aa for their Hidaayat.\n\n3. Previously answered\n\n4.
