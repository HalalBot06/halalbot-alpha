  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan one partake in the company's year end dinner function?  The dinner will be held in a hotel and they serve haraam foods as well as alcohol.  I have already refused the invitation because I do not feel comfortable sitting with people who eat prok and drink liquor but also wanted clarity.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is not permissible to join a company’s year end party if the laws of shariah are violated in the party. As a Muslim, one should take Islam and its values seriously. One should guard himself against everything that will compromise and dampen his Islamic values.\n\nThe dangers of giving in and compromising in Islamic values are too grave.Such an attitude will allow the un-Islamic practice to permeate into ones lifestyle, thus increasing ones un-Islamic practices. Today it is joining a party of mixed gender, tomorrow one will be sitting alone with the opposite gender! Today one sits with one drinking wine, tomorrow the same person will be drinking wine. That would lead one to the borders of Kufr and even possibly deprive one of his Iemaan. What is supposed to be just a compromise and diplomatic mission is now the very opposite of the actual initial intention.\n\n1. It is a well known fact intermingling of sexes is haram. That is a road to zina. Allah says, “And do not go close to zina as it is immoral”.\n\n2. Music is a prominent part of parties. Music is also haram. Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said that music is one of the signs of Qiyamat.\n\n3. Wine and intoxicants are haram. Allah says, “Oh you who believe, wine is evil and from the acts of Shaitaan”. A Muslim has Iemaan in his heart. He believes in the Quran which contains pure orders. A Muslim performs salat that stops him from evil. He believes in the Day of Qiyamat and accountability in the court of Allah.\n\nIn the background of all this, how can a Muslim not be uneasy at attending parties which have haram in them? Whilst party makers will merry, his heart will be tearing- what partying is that?!\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
