If you not married, then you were guilty of two sins, fornication and abortion. If you are married, then too you are guilty of the sin of abortion. You state you regret committing these sins. If you are honest and sincere in your regret, then be rest assured that Allah is Most Forgiving and Most Merciful. He will forgive you on condition you make a firm intention never to commit such sins in the future. You should get in touch with pious people and benefit from them and work towards reformation and getting closer to Allah. Real peace and happiness lies in the closeness to Allah. He is pace and sends peace to those who make peace with him. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
