  "question": "I write articles on the internet and get paid for it. Is my source of income halal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI write articles on the internet and get paid for it. I have been using a website for promotion and in it I placed my ad for my service, but I used a stolen picture to describe my service. I got a few orders and completed them and got paid for them. Is my earning halal?\n\nI got paid for the service which I provided but I used a stolen picture in the ad which I used to obtain my orders. Also my parents bought me a laptop and internet connection. I don’t know if they used halal money. I think they used credit cards or welfare money for which im not sure if we qualify for. Regardless of where they got their money is my income halal, if I use what they bought me to make money.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh. \n\nThe service you render as a writer is permissible. Your income is Halaal. However, you have committed a sin advertising your work through a stolen picture. For that you should offer some charity to purify your income.\n\nNabi salallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam said,\n\nيَا مَعْشَرَ التُّجَّارِ إِنَّ الْبَيْعَ يَحْضُرُهُ اللَّغْوُ وَالْحَلِفُ فَشُوبُوهُ بِالصَّدَقَةِ\n\n“Oh group of traders verily vanity and false oaths couple trade so offset it with charity.”\n\nمشكاة المصابيح 2/ 851؛ المكتب الإسلامي\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Ali bin Cassim\n\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nLos Angeles, CA (USA)\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
