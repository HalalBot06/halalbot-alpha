  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is tahir mutahira, and tahir ghayr mutahira. How come you can't wash your hand with water and use the same water to wash another part? You see I take a while in wudhu and don't want to waste water so after wash my mouth I would plug the drain and use that water to wash my feet, or arms or whatever. I didn't know about tahir mutahira so do I have to make up those prayers? But I read the Prophet's (SAW) wives or wife made ghusl. He used the same water. She told him she was sexually defiled I think. He said the water is not impure. Jazakum Allahu Khayran.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTaahir means the water itself is clean. Mutahhir means the water can serve\nto remove Hadath (state of intangible impurity). Thus, the term Taahir\nMutahhir refers to water that is itself pure and can remove Hadath. Taahir\nghayr Mutahhir refers to that water that is itself pure but may not serve to\nremove Hadath.\n\nThe Hadith you are referring to discusses an entirely different issue. It is\nconcerned with left over water and not used water. Used water is water that\nhas dropped off the body after using it for Wudhu or Ghusl. Left over water\nis water left in the container after some water has been taken out and used\nfor Wudhu or Ghusl.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
