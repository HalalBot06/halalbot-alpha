  "question": "I have a doubt about the fatiha practice which ppl practice in India and Pakistan.Is it an Innovation?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn Fatiha some food is made and then recite some surahs from the Quran like Surah Fatiha and then eat it.I just want to know is it ok to give fatiha,if not then please quote the hadith of Prophet Mohammed(SAWS) which states this.Waiting for a reply from u. Allahhafiz Rahmathullah Siddiqui.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFaatiha ceremonies are not proven from Hadith. These are customs and rituals practiced in the Indo-pak subcontinent.\n\nThese Faatiha ceremonies include many prohibited acts in Shari?ah, viz. intermingling of sexes, etc. hence, not permissible. Therefore, it is incorrect to host or attend a Faatiha ceremony.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
