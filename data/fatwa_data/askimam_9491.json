  "question": "Chanting awliya name during dhikr is it permissible. Antum fooru deewa naflee (Gay lanee Gay lanee )Antum hayaati wakullee",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRecitation of qasida acceptable?(pls translate this qasida : Antum fooru deewa naflee (Gay lanee Gay lanee )Antum hayaati wakullee (Gay lanee Gay lanee ) Ya qibati fissalaatee (Gay lanee Gay lanee )Eedhawa qaf to oo sallee (Gay lanee Gay lanee )Wa kuntu zamaanee moosa (Gay lanee Gay lanee )\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDhikr is made only for Allah, and not for anyone else. It is Haraam%0D%0A(strictly prohibited) to make the Dhikr of anyone besides Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe poem (Qaseedah) in the details of the question expresses submission to%0D%0AShaykh Abdul-Qaadir Jailaani (RA). That is Kufr and disbelief. How can the%0D%0Agreat Shaykh be anyone's life or means of any one's life as indicated in the%0D%0Adream, 'Antum hayaati wa kullee'? How can the great Shaykh be the direction%0D%0Aof one's Qiblah in Salaat as indicated in 'Yaa Qibbatee fiy salaatiy'? The%0D%0Aother couplets are not clear to us. Any person saying such couplets loses%0D%0Ahis%2Fher Imaan. If the person is married, his Nikah is invalidated. If he has%0D%0Achildren thereafter, they will be illegitimate.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is the responsibility of every Muslim to condemn such practise as that is%0D%0AKufr and disbelief. A Muslim must express submission only to Allah. He Alone%0D%0Ahas created us. Our life is owed to Him. Our complete trust is in Allah. The%0D%0Adirection of our Salaat is according to His order. The great saint, Shaykh%0D%0AAbdul-Qaadir (RA) never instructed anyone to make Dhikr in his name. Such%0D%0Apractice should be openly and publicly condemned. The Ulama should openly%0D%0Aand boldly criticise such a practice that goes against Tawheed (Oneness) of%0D%0AAllah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
