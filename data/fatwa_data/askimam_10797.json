  "question": "Kissing the thumbs upon hearing prophet (s.a.w) name during azaan",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nA friend of mine has told me that it is permissible to kiss the thumbs upon hearing the name of prophet s.a.w during azaan. I would like to know is it permissible. Also he told me a hadith regarding this. IN A HADITH THE HOLY PROPHET (SAW) HAS STATED: ?any person who hears my name in the azaan and passes his thumbnails over his eyes, i shall search out that person from the rows of poeple on judgement and lead him into jannah behind me\"\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour Aqaaid of having utmost respect for Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] is correct. However, it should be borne in mind that Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] is the prophet of Allah. Allah is the Creator, Nourisher and Cherisher. A Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] too is bound by the laws of Almighty Allah Ta?ala and has to express submission and subjugation to Allah Ta?ala. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] himself said, ?I am but just a humble slave of Allah?.%0D%0A%0D%0ANowadays, there are those who surpass the limits of respect with the result of elevating the status of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] to the status of Allah. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ?Do not exaggerate in my praises as the Christians exaggerated in the praises of Eesa [alayhis salaam], thus, raising him to the position of God.?%0D%0A%0D%0ARespect for Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] dictates emulating his teachings. It would be disrespectful to do anything against the Sunnah of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. Kissing the thumbs upon hearing the name of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has no basis in Shari?ah. To carry out such an act as a Sunnah is bid?ah and sin.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
