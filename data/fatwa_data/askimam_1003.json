  "question": "What is the Islamic teaching on how the Universe was created? Are muslims allowed to study creation of the universe?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSorry I have so many questions, I am lost and need guidance urgently. Please don't discard my query and read passage bellow fully. Please e-mail the answers as soon as possible. Thankyou so much. I study Physics. I want to know whether the Big bang theory is correct with Islam. What does Islam teach on: How did the universe start? What from? What was there before the universe? Is it right to study how the universe was created - or are we not supposed to interfere with Allah's work? Does it say in Quran or Hadith that it is possible to gain a full comprehension of creation of universe. If a full comprehension is not possible, then is it still worthy to seek a partial comprehension? I have heard that God created 7 Worlds, each on top of the other. Is this true? If so, what exists in these other worlds? Also, how is the universe to end? Does heaven exist for ever and ever - what does this mean, how can something exist for ever and evr - there has to be an end doesnt there? And, does the Quran rule out the possiblilit of Alien life? Or is it possible they exist?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Imraan ibn Husain (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was asked, 'How did this world commence?' Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) replied, 'Allah was on His throne above the water (nothing between the throne and water) and from water he created every living object.' (Mishkaat vol.2)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Hadith referred to by you means, among the first things created, one was the Rooh (soul) of our beloved Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The creation of Allah Ta%E3la is very vast and beyond our comprehension. In every time and era scientists have made strange discoveries of the creation of Allah and they will continue to do so. However, the research of the scientists will be exhausted yet they will never be able to conquer the reality of the creations of Allah, nor will they be able to discover even a fraction of the entire creation.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, the creation of Allah is a manifestation of the Power of Allah. Allah invites us to ponder upon His creation and understand His Power. With regard to aliens and flying objects and dinasours, since the reality of these creations are not known, it is not possible to comment upon them. For our belief, if there is reality in these creations, it should be seen as another manifestation of Allah's Power.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta%E3la Knows Best.%0D%0A%0D%0AWas salaam%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
