  "question": "I read your answer regarding the jummah khutba and you gave opinions of the three imams and only imam abu hanifa was left out. If possible can I have his opinion.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was told that Imam abu hanifa had an opinion saying that jummah khutba could be in any language is that true? Another question is jummah without a khalifa valid or not as the sharait(essential requirements) of jummah have a lot to do with khalifat?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Therefore, to deliver the Khutbah in any language other than Arabic is\nstrictly forbidden. (Umdatur Ridaaya, footnote Sharah Wiqaayah vol. 1 p.\n200)\n2. The importance of Jummu'ah warrants an important person like the Khalifah\nto perform Jummu'ah. However, Jummu'ah performed by any one else besides the\nKhalifah will also be valid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
