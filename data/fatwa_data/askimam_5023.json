  "question": "Please explain my dream",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalamu alakum. I am in love with someone, we plan on getting married but don?t know what my parents will say (they don?t know about him). He is a Muslim but he dates and goes clubbing. He promises all that will change. He did that stuff before we met so he says when we get married he will stop. Insha Allah every thing works out for the best. Anyway my dream is that I was in my room with him and a girl who is a friend of his, but it felt like they went out with each other. So I?m in my room I was laying in bed with him and we were so happy. The girl was curled up at the edge of the bed next to our feet. It was as if she did not matter to us. I gave him a kiss and we told each other we loved each other (felt a kind of like we were married). Then my mom wanted to come into my room so I told both of them to go out the window. Then I went out the room to distract my mom and when I came back later they were both still hiding in the closet so I told them to go out the window again. Then I went down to distract everyone. Its hard to explain the dream so please help explain what you can. Thank you wa gazaak Allahu kaeer\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nGetting married is a big step in life. It may be a means of peace and\nharmony or grief and agony. Much depends on the marriage partner.\n\nWe advise you exercise precaution in choosing your marriage partner and for\nthat you should discuss the matter with your parents. They have love for you\nas well as experience. Their guidance will be motivated by their love for\nyou and your best interest. You cannot simply marry a person based on his\npromise to change. Many young girls have witnessed unfulfilled promises and\nexperienced grief and rejection by their partners after marriage. We have\nobserved that dating often becomes an addiction and that ruins marriage. We,\ntherefore, advise you exercise precaution and not base your decision on a\nsimple dream.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
