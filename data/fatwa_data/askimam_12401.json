  "question": "Can women pray immediately behind men in a masjid with no screening in between?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome women came and started arguing that we will pray just behind men in jamaat in the masjid. I wanted to know is this permissible? Also, will it be correct to say that for woman to pray in jamaat behind men there should be appropriate screening in between. The women were arguing that there is no where written in Islam for a screening to be there? Please comment in detail because some women cause this problem very often now. 2. One friend of mine told me that Ibn Umar used to dye his hair black, and said that the prophet advised the person (mentioned in the hadith) not to dye black because he was an old person and black would not look on an old person. Is this true? 3. During monthly periods should a woman fast? If not, then does she need to make it up afterwards? 4. During monthly periods should a woman pray? If not, then does she need to make it up afterwards?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\na) It is not permissible for women to perform their Salaat immediately behind the men. The method that is implemented is first men, then children, then hermaphrodites, then women. This is the order implemented by Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam].%0D%0A%0D%0Ab) It should be taken into consideration that that the Ahaadith regarding women coming to the Musjid have the condition added that there should be no fear of Fitnah. It is further stated under this Hadith that there was no fear of Fitnah at the time of Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam]. A riwaayat is narrated by Hadhrat Aaisha [Radhiallaahu anha] that, ?If Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam] had to see the way the women of our times are, he would stope them from coming to the Musjid. %0D%0A%0D%0Ac) The Hadith narrated by ibn Umar [Radhiallaahu anhu] about Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] not permitting the dyeing of hair black is not because black does not look right on old people, instead Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] did not permit it because it would be deception and would cause an old person to look young. Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] says, ?He who deceives is not from amongst us.?%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
