  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI heard that there is a hadis saying that there is no need to do ghusl if one does not climax during sexual intercourse. please provide reference of the hadis.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAccording to Shariah, Ghusal will become necessary once the husband makes Dukhool (penetrates) his wife even though the husband did not reach climax. Ghusal will also become necessary upon the wife.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
