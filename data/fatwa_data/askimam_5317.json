  "answer": "QUESTION\nIt was believed that Islam offers very strict rules, which nowadays are impossible or at least very difficult to follow. I have heard from speeches of ulemas and in books that quoted a hadith that said that Allah swt will forgive all sins except for zina and loanFrom another hadith it was quoted that, all sins will be forgiven except for shirk and kufr. Another stated that taking snaps would not be forgiven. Furthermore, another stated that if somebody misses a solat purposely, then this sin will not be forgiven. Once again, we came across a very alarming hadith which stated 7 sins which most of the muslims are engaged in committing nowadays will not be forgiven. Those are: 1. shaving off beards 2. covering ankles 3. women refraining from parda 4. people who sing, listen, participate in making songs 5. people who develop, take, any kind of living pictures(snaps). 6. riba 7. backbiting. The hadith which was quoted for these above 7 acts was Kullu ummat-e- maafi illa mujahirooni.e. Those who do sins openly will not be forgiven. So all of these are the sins which most of us perform. Secondly, why are these hadiths contradicting. Does it means that all of these wont be forgiven, or there is any one of these narrations which should be considered the most important one? In addition, I have heard that wearing a beard is farz bilIjmaeummah. But why is it said to be sunnah? Prophet said, that on the day of judgement, he wont meet(regard) people as Muslims who are without beards.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Although there is an apparent contradiction in the Ahaadith, if one\nanalyses the Ahaadith, the contradiction will be no more. Kufr and Shirk\nwill definitely not be forgiven. Hence, a person who dies a disbeliever (as\na Kaafir or Mushrik) is destined to hell. As for the other sins mentioned,\nAllah Ta'ala will forgive them if a person repents sincerely. So, when the\nHadith says 'they will not be forgiven' it means that 'if they do not\nrepent, they will not be forgiven' and they will be punished for it in the\nhereafter.\n2. The wearing of the beard is described in the Ahaadith as a Fitrah\n(natural thing). At the same time, shaving or trimming, etc. is forbidden.\nTherefore, it becomes necessary to grow one. So those who refer to it as\nSunnah, refer to it as such in the first context whilst those who say it is\nFardh refer to the second meaning.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
