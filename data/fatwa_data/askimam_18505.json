  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to ask about Wearing of Taweez in light of Quran & Sahee Hadith. As per my sufficient knowledge our beloved Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) never advised to any one for wearing Taweez & if its true than isn’t it a Bidat to do so?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIt is permissible to wear a taweez (Amulet)[1], However we would advice one to recite the following Azkaars which have been mentioned in the Ahaadith instead of utilising Taweez. These Azkaar and Ad’iya are more effective.[2]\n\nThere are three conditions for the permissibility of Taweez.\n\nIt is in one of the understood languages.\nIt is derived from Quran or Ahaadith[3].\nIt is not considered that the Taweez itself is effective, but that Allah Ta’ala puts the effect in the Taweez. [4]\n\n Ahaadith on the permissibility of Taweez.\n\nHadrat Anas (RadiyallahuAnhu) reports that Nabi (SallalahuAllaihiWassalam) gave him permission to do ruqya for evil eye, fever, the numbing of a limb. (Muslim)[5]\nHadrat Aisha (RadiyallahuAnhu) says that Nabi (SallalahuAllaihiWassalam) asked us to do ruqya for the evil eye. (Bukhari & Muslim)[6]\nHadrat Umme Salamah (RadiyallahuAnhu) narrates that Nabi (SallalahuAllaihiWassalam) saw a slave girl in her house on whose face was discoloration. He asked us to do ruqya on her, for verily she has been afflicted with an evil eye. (Bukhari & Muslim)[7]\nHadrat Auf ibn Malik Al-Ashja’ee says “We use to do ruqya in the days of Jaheeliya. We asked Nabi (SallalahuAllaihiWassalam), O Prophet of Allah, what is your opinion on this matter? He replied “recite your ruqya to me. There is nothing wrong with ruqya as long as there is no shirk in it”. (Muslim)[8]\n\n \n\nWAZEEFAS FOR MORNING AND EVENING AND SECURITY\n\nاَللَّهُمَّ أَجِرْنِىْ مِنَ النَّارْ   (1)\n\nO Allah! Protect me from the hellfire.\n\nSayyidunā Hārith Ibn Muslim رضى الله عنه reports from his father that Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم once confided in him saying, “On completion of your Maghrib Salāh, recite (the above-mentioned duā) seven times before speaking to anyone. If you read this (duā) and pass away that very night, most definitely you will be emancipated from the hellfire.” (Sunan Abi Dāwud #5039)\n\nOne will receive the very same reward for reciting this dua on completion of the Fajr Salāh.\n\n \n\n \n\nرَضِيْناَ بِاللَّهِ رَبًّا وَبِاْلإِسْلاَمِ دِيْنًا وَبِمُحَمَّدٍr  نَبِيًّا وَّ رَسُوْلاً(2)\n\nI am pleased with Allah as my Lord, Islam as my religion and\n\nMuhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم as my Prophet.\n\nSayyidunā Thawbān رضى الله عنه states that Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم said, “Whoever recites (the above-mentioned duā) thrice in the morning and evening, Allah will undertake the responsibility to abundantly reward him in such a way that would please and satisfy him on the day of Qiyamah.”\n\n(Sunan Abi Dāwud #5033; Mustadrak Hakim #1904; Mirqatul Mafatih v.5 p.311, Beirut)\n\n \n\n \n\nأَعُوْذُ بِكَلِمَاتِ اللَّهِ التَّامَّاتِ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا خَلَقَ (3)\n\nI seek protection with the complete words of Allah from the evil of whatever He created.\n\nSayyidah Khawlah Bint Hakīm رضى الله عنها states, “I heard Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم say, 'Whoever alights at a certain destination and reads (the above-mentioned duā), nothing will harm him until he travels from that place.'”(Sahīh Muslim #2635)\n\n \n\n \n\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الَّذِىْ لاَ يَضُرُّ مَعَ اسْمِهِ شَىْءٌ فِى اْلأَرْضِ وَلاَ فِى السَّمَاءِ وَهُوَ السَّمِيْعُ الْعَلِيْمُ(4)\n\nIn Allah’s name through which nothing in the earth or heavens can harm. And He is the all-Hearing, all-Knowing.\n\nSayyiduna Abān Ibn Uthmān رضى الله عنه narrates, “I heard my father, (Uthmān ibn Affān  رضى الله عنه), saying that Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم said, “Whoever recites (the above-mentioned duā) thrice in the morning and evening, will not be harmed by anything.” However, Sayyidunā Abān Ibn Uthmān رضى الله عنه (the narrator of the Hadith) was once afflicted by a stroke. A certain man began staring at him in surprise. Sayyidunā Abān رضى الله عنه asked him, “Why are you looking at me in astonishment? Listen well! The Hadith is true, just as I narrated it to you. But I did not read it on that day (when afflicted by the stroke) resulting in Allah decreeing it (the stroke).” (Sunan Tirmidhi #3388)\n\n \n\n \n\nاَللَّهُ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ . لاَ تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وََّلاَ نَوْمٌ . لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ (5)\n\n وَمَا  فِي الأَرْضِ . مَنْ ذَا الَّذِيْ يَشْفَعُ عِنْدَهُ إَِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ . يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيْهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ . وَلاَ يُحِيْطُوْنَ بِشَيْءٍ مِنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلاَّ بِمَا شَاءَ . وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالاَرْضَ . وَلاَ يَئُوْدُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا . وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْعَظِيْمُ\n\nAllah (is such that) besides Him there is no Deity. He is Ever Living, The maintainer of everything. Neither sleep overcomes Him nor drowsiness. All that is in the skies and all within the earth belong to him. Who is there that can intercede before Him without His permission? (None can do this). He knows what is before them (He knows what lies ahead for His creation) and what is behind them while they possess none of His knowledge except if He wills (except what He teaches them). His throne (His knowledge and His power) encompasses the heavens and the earth (and whatever is within them) and He never tires of caring for them. He is High (above His creation), the Supreme..\n\nIn a lengthy narration, while discussing his encounter with a strange man (discovered to be Shaytān), Sayyidunā Abu Hurairah رضى الله عنه states that he was informed by Shaytān to recite Ayatul Kursi. [\"…When you go to sleep, recite Ayatul Kursi until you complete the Ayah. If you do so, you will be in the protection of Allah and no Shaytān will come close to you until the morning.\" Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم responded to these words by saying, \"Listen well! He (Shaytān) has spoken the truth despite being a great liar.\"] (Sahīh Bukhari #2311)\n\n \n\n \n\n(6)      سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ عَدَدَ خَلْقِهِ وَرِضَا نَفْسِهِ وَزِنَةَ عَرْشِهِ وَمِدَادَ كَلِمَاتِهِ\n\nPurity and praises are for Allah according to the number of His creation, to the extent of His pleasure, equivalent to the weight of His throne and in proportion to the ink of His words (knowledge and wisdom).\n\nSayyidah Juwairiyah رضى الله عنها reported that on one occasion, Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم went away from her in the early morning to perform the Fajr Salāh while she was in her prayer area. Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم returned, after it became considerably bright, to find her in the same condition as he had left her. He then enquired, \"Have you remained in the same state as I had left you?\" \"Yes\" was the reply. To this Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم commented, \"I had recited four phrases thrice, if they have to be weighed, they will outweigh whatever you have supplicated since the morning (due to its excellence and virtue).\"\n\n(Sahīh Muslim #2654)\n\nNote the pronunciation of the following word as زِنَةَ (zinata) and not زِيْنَةَ (zeenata) with aي\n\n \n\n \n\nاَللَّهُمَّ مَا أَصْبَحَ (اَمْسَى) بِىْ مِنْ نِّعْمَةٍ اَوْ بِأَحَدٍ مٍنْ خَلْقِكَ فَمِنْكَ وَحْدَكَ (7)\n\nلاَ شَرِيْكَ لَكَ فَلَكَ الْحَمْدُ وَلَكَ الشُّكْرُ\n\nO Allah, Whatever bounties I, or any of Your creation have experienced during the morning / the evening, it is from You alone. You have no partner and all praises belong to You.\n\nSayyidunā Abdullah Ibn Ghannām رضى الله عنه states that Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم said, \"Whoever recites (the above-mentioned Duā) in the morning and evening, has discharged his obligation of gratitude (to Allah) for that day.'' (Shu'abul Imān #4368)\n\nNOTE: The word أَصْبَحَ should be recited in the morning, and be replaced with اَمْسَى when recited in the evening.  \n\n \n\n \n\nاَللَّهُمَّ إِنَّا نَجْعَلُكَ فِىْ نُحُوْرِهِمْ وَنَعُوْذُ بِكَ مِنْ شُرُوْرِهِمْ  (8)\n\nO Allah, we place You in their direction (to ward them away from us) and we seek Your protection from their evil.\n\nSayyidunā Abu Burdāh Ibn Abdullah رضى الله عنه reports from his father that, whenever Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم would apprehend (fear) any nation, he would recite, \"O Allah, we place You in their direction (to ward them away from us) and we seek Your protection from their evil.\" (Sunan Abu Dāwud #1532)\n\n \n\n \n\nاَللَّهُمَّ اكْفِنَاهُم بِمَا شِئْتَ (9)\n\nO Allah, suffice us as You will in regards to them!\n\nWhile narrating the incident of his emigration to Madinah Munawwarah with Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم, Sayyiduna Abu Bakr رضى الله عنه stated that, \"We continued traveling while the (enemy-disbelievers) were in search of us. No one from amongst them caught up with us except Surāqah Ibn Mālik who was mounted on his horse. I thus exclaimed, 'This seeker has caught up with us, O Rasulullāh!' and I began crying. Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم said, 'Don't worry! Allah is definitely with us.' Again when he drew closer and there was barely the distance of two or three spear-lengths between us, I said, 'This seeker has caught up with us, O Rasulullah!' (And again) I began to cry. Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم enquired, 'What is causing you to cry?' I replied, 'By the oath of Allah, I am not crying due to fear for myself, rather, I am crying for your sake (I am concerned about your safety).' Thereafter, Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم cursed Suraqah saying, 'O Allah! Suffice us as You will against him!' As a result, his horse sunk with him into the ground until it reached its belly causing him to fall off from it.\" (Sahīh Ibn Hibbān #6870)\n\n \n\n \n\n(10)  اَللَّهُمَّ أنْتَ رَبِّي لاَ إلَهَ إلاَّ أنْتَ خَلَقْتَنِيْ وَأَنَا عَبْدُكَ وأَناَ عَلَى عَهْدِكَ وَوَعْدِك\n\nمَا اسْتَطَعْتُ أَعُوْذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ ماَ صَنَعْتُ أَبُوْءُ لَكَ بِنِعْمَتِكَ عَلَيَّ وَأَبُوْءُ لَكَ بِذَنْبِيْ فَاغْفِرْ لِيْ فَإِنَّهُ لاَ يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوْبَ إِلاَّ أَنْتَ\n\nO Allah, You are my Lord, There is no deity besides You. You have created me and I am your slave. I am (trying to be) steadfast on the pledge and promise I have taken with you to the best of my ability. I seek protection in you from the evil of my actions. I acknowledge Your bounties upon me and I admit my sins. Forgive me, for no one forgives sins besides You.\n\nSayyidunā Shaddād Ibn Aus عنه  رضى اللهnarrates that Rasulullah  صلى الله عليه و سلمsaid, “Sayyidul istighfar (i.e. the most splendid form of seeking forgiveness from Allah Ta’ala) is to say…(the above-mentioned Duā). Whoever recites it during the day with conviction and dies on that day, will be (recorded) from among the inhabitants of Jannah. And whoever recites it with conviction at night and dies on that night, will be (recorded) from among the inhabitants of Jannah.” (Sahīh Bukhari #6306)\n\nNOTE: One should take note that there are two basic requirements to achieve the complete and desired effect of these and similarly, all other wazeefas. The first being, to recite them with complete conviction (yaqeen) and confidence that whatever promises Allah Y and Nabi r have declared is undoubtedly true since the effect of ones supplications is in accordance to the level of one’s conviction on them. The second is, to give up all sins. Hazrat Moulana Hakeem Muhammad Akhtar Sahib دامت بركاته has stated in this regard that, just as it is necessary for a person to abstain from poison while taking medicine, likewise the full benefit of (these) duas will only be realized if a person abstains from sin. If perchance one does commit sin, one should immediately resort to tawbah and istighfaar. Therefore, abstention from sin is absolutely necessary.  \n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl.
