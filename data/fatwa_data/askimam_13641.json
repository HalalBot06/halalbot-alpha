  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDear Mufti i am from Austraila we had eid on Thursday even though no moon was sited wednesday evening.  Other parts of Australia had eid on Friday. I read Eid salah on thursday as in our state all the muslims had decided eid was on thursday thus i had no option but to make eid on thursday, as all the mosques had eid on this day.  Is this ok ?  & secondly if it was wrong in doing so what should we do ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe advise as a matter of precaution that you keep one Qadhaa fast of Ramadhaan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
