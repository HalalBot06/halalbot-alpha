  "question": "I am deeply disturbed by what is happening in Palestine and the following questions obsess me ...Is a Muslim allowed to kill unarmed civilians, pregnant women and little children?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs a Muslim allowed to kill unarmed civilians, pregnant women and little children? Does a Muslim become a martyr if he dies in such a killing? Is there some kind of bonus for a Muslim who kills Jews in that way? Does Islam allow a woman to do all the above, and with the same reward? Thanking you in advance for any clarification of these difficult issues.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIrrespective of the objectives of a martyr, it is incorrect to kill civilians especially women and children and there is no reward for killing a civilian Jew in times of peace.\n\nYes, if the target is a soldier, for instance, and a civilian is caught in the crossfire, it will be viewed as unavoidable collateral damage.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nchecked & approved by: mUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
