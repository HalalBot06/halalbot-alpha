  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn the answer to question 6737, you say that a man can marry a girl and have a sexual relation no matter how young she is. I have never heard about anything in Islam supporting such a view, so I would like you to tell which verses in the holy Quran or Hadith who teach this. Thank you in advance\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIslam supports the view that a person may marry or have sexual relations with a female from the age she reaches puberty.\n\nThe age will differ according to different individuals, climates, etc. This is because puberty indicates that a female is now capable of having sexual relations. Refer attached article.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
