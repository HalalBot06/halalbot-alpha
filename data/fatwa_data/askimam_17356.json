And we can not perform Umrah in month of HAJ, please correct me if I am wrong.\n\n \n\nThanks and Best Regards,\n\nNouman Qazi\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n Assalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nWe make dua that Allah Ta’ala grant all our hujjaj a hajj maqbool and make it easy for them. (Ameen.)\n\nWhoever lives within the miqat, will fall under the ruling of a makki (one who stays in Makkah Mukarramah). Therefore, just as a makki could only perform ifrad hajj, similarly those who stay within the miqat could only perform ifrad hajj (i.e. perform hajj only without joining umrah with it).\n\nTamattu hajj is when one performs umrah in the months of hajj and thereafter performs hajj in the same year with a new ihram. Since you have already performed umrah and you are going to perform hajj, therefore, you will fall under the category of those who will be performing tamaatu hajj. However, since you are also in the ruling of a makki therefore, you will have to slaughter a dam. This dam will not be out of gratitude to Allah Ta’ala but will be as a compensation for going against the command of Allah Ta’ala by performing tamattu hajj. You should also not perform another umrah before performing your hajj.\n\nIt is permissible to change the ihram if there is a valid reason. One should not change his ihram merely to have a clean ihram.\n\nTawaf qudoom is the first tawaf a person will perform before starting his hajj. This will be as a greeting similar to tahiyyatul masjid when one enters the masjid. Tawaf qudoom is sunaah muakkada for those who are not makki. A makki shall not perform tawaf qudoom.\n\nTawaf ziyarat is the tawaf of hajj which is performed on the ten of zul hijja. This tawaf is fardh.\n\nTawaf sadar is the last tawaf one would perform before leaving the holy city of Makkah Mukarramah. It is wajib for those who are not makki. Imam Abu Yusuf رحمه الله تعلى mentions that I prefer that a makki also performs tawaf sadar.\n\nRefer to Manasik of Mulla Ali Qari رحمه الله تعالى page 140 and 252.\n\nSince you are under the ruling of a makki, you will not perform tawaf qudoom.\n\nOn the 9th one will go to Arafa after sunrise and stay until sunset. It is fardh to go to Arafa.\n\nAfter sunset one will go to Muzdalifa. It is Sunnah makkadah to spend the night in Muzdalifa. It is wajib to spend time between subh sadiq and sunrise.\n\nPerforming tawaf ziyarah in days of hajj is wajib not fardh.\n\nIf a person combines between hajj and umrah in one ihram, then this would be qiran. If he combines it with two ihrams, then this will be tamattu.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Ishaq E. Moosa,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nConcured by:\n\n \n\nDarul Iftaa"
