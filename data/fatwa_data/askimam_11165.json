(Tirmidhi).%0D%0A%0D%0AYou state your husband was married before and his mother had problems with his ex-wife. By now, your husband should know his mother?s nature and attitude. He went through a knock and still did not learn. When will he learn? Furthermore, does your husband not know the famous injunction of the Qur?aan, ?Never say uff to your parents?? When his parents advised him not to go to his in-laws, why did he respond rudely to his mother. If his mother was wrong in objecting to you going out, that does not justify him doing wrong to his mother. There were other ways to attend to the problem.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is natural for you to feel for your husband being upset. However, his mother has the right of being more upset as her son back chattered her and was rude to her. You have acted appropriately by asking for maaf. However, that is not enough to heal the wound of his mother?s heart. He has to go beyond that and endervour to the best of his ability to make his mother happy. He has to tolerate her. If he does not, he will be forced to tolerate something bigger as in this incident.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
