  "answer": "QUESTION\nSlmz honourable mufti saab. Just wanted to know if one's feet lifts off the ground in sajdah,is the salaah broken??\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nFor the validity of Sajdah and the Salâh it is imperative for at least one foot to be on the ground during Sajdah. If one foot was on the floor for the duration of one tasbeeh, this will suffice. However, if none of the feet were on the floor during this duration, it would be necessary to repeat the Salâh. (Ahsanul Fatawa, Vol. 3, Pg. 398.)\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
