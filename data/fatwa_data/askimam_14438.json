  "question": "how can I progress in my religion and serve my religion by being a doctor?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am studying pre-medicine at a college right now and then I will be going to medical school inshallah.  I was wondering what should be my intention while I do my studies so that I can please allah throughout my studies.  what should be my goal, intention and aim during my studies as well as after I become a doctor.  I want to do everyting for Allah, so is my studying of biology, chemistry, physics and other subjects helping me in this path towards allah or hindering my path towards allah.  In other words what should be my mindset and thought process while I conduct my studies.  Also, how can I progress in my religion and serve my religion by being a doctor?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah has created man and Jinn to worship Him. Allah states, ‘I have created man and Jinn solely for my worship.’ In another Aayat, ‘Do you think that you have been created in vein, and you will not return to us.’\n\nMost certainly, we have been created to worship Allah and we will be resurrected to give an account of our deeds. This our life is but a test. Allah has created life and death to test who does the best actions. The integral part of every action is intention as narrated by Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] ,’ Every action is judged according to the intention.’\n\nTherefore, the preliminary intention of every action should be the pleasure of Allah. Allah is pure and only accepts those actions that are done purely for his pleasure. Therefore, it is imperative for one to have a pure intention before doing any act. If a person studies to become an Aalim, doctor, etc. and his intention is to please Allah and serve His Deen through his profession and skills, then most certainly, he is on the correct path. A doctor can serve the Deen of Allah by helping poor and needy people with medication and treatment, etc. with the sole intention of Allah’s pleasure. Because the creation are like the family of Allah, and the most beloved to Allah are those who are good to Allah’s creation. In another Hadith, Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Allah is in the help of a person as long as he helps his brother.’ (Mustadrak).\n\nOne can help a person even though his profession and skills thereby earning the help of Allah. One should always keep in mind his identity that ‘first, I am a Muslim, then a doctor, lawyer, etc. I will use my profession or my expertise in the upliftment of Deen solely for Allah’s pleasure.’\n\nAs a person furthers his studies, it is possible that one’s intention, aim and goal may change. Therefore, it is important for one to keep in contact with an Aalim that will advise and guide one from time to time.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
