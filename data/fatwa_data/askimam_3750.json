  "question": "Is it necessary to remove a taweez when going to the bathroom?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti, I am aware that when going to the bathroom to relieve oneself it is necessary to remove any rings, pendants etc that have the name of Allah or a verse of the Qur'an upon them. But is it necessary to remove them if one goes to the bathroom (a room which includes the toilet) simply to do wudu? Also I know that if a taweez or the like is sewn or waxed into clothing it is not necessary to remove the garment but what if the name of Allah or a verse is printed onto a T-shirt?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not necessary to remove rings, pendants, etc. when making Wudhu in a\nbathroom that has an attached toilet.\n\nHowever, it is advisable to do so as a mark of respect. The same ruling\napplies in the case of making Wudhu with a Tshint that has Allah's name\nprinted on it.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
