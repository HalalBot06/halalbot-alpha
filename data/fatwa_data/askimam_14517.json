  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWe have a situation in our Masjid and would like to know what the community should do.  The Imam, who is also a Quran Hafiz, in the past seven years there have been numerous complaints about his conduct.  More than 11 people have seen him stealing money from the donation box.\n\nOur question is, should we still pray behind him, and what action should be taken against him?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe trustees and responsible people of the community should approach the individual and discuss the matter with him directly. If he co-operates, then the trustees could consider his position of being an Imaam after meeting him.\n\nIf he does not co-operate, then another person should be appointed as an Imaam. The overwhelming evidence and eyewitnesses against the individual could be considered if he does not use the opportunity of meeting the trustees to defend the allegation against him.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
