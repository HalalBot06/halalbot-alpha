  "question": "Can my husband still reconcile after finished my iddat, if I got khula????",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-O-Allaikum, I just have a question, I needed to get divorce from my abusive husband. After separated from him, I filed for divorce in US court & in the Islamic court. Ulama tried to contact him, sent many letters w/registered mail, he didn?t respond to any. Ulama then had no choice then to give me ?Separation Decree?. I started my iddat & today is a 2nd day. I was wondering, if in future he?ll try to reconcile, is he allowed to do that? Even after my iddat is over too. I mean after my iddat is over too & he?ll try to reconcile can he do that? I?d really appreciate if u can give me specific answer to my question\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe 'separation decree' is called Faskh.\n\nAfter your Iddah passes, you are a stranger to him. If the two of you wish\nto reconcile thereafter, a new Nikah has to be made. In this Nikah your\nvoluntary permission is necessary. If you do not wish to reconcile, you\ncannot be compelled to do so.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
