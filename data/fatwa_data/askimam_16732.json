  "question": "Can a woman have relations after her period is over but before she has Ghusal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question is \"Can a woman have relations after her period is over but before she has ghusal?\"\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1. It is permissible for a man to have conjugal relations with his wife once her menstrual period has terminated before ten days as per her monthly habit and a complete salah time elapses after her bleeding stops, even though she did not take a bath. However it is preferable that she take a bath.\n\n \n\n[Nurul Idaah Pg.51 Kutub Khaanah Imdaadiyah Deoband]\n\n \n\n2. If a woman bled for ten days and ten nights, then the moment she stops bleeding sexual intercourse with her will be permissible irrespective of her taking a bath or not.         [Bahishti Zewar Pg.92]\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
