  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhen trying for a child, I have heard that there are certain dates that should be avoided for intercourse.  For example the 14th, 15th and 16th of the Islamic months should be avoided in order to have a healthy baby.  Is there any Islamic basis for this?  Are there other days/dates that should be avoided?\n\nJazak'Allah Khair\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThere is no Islamic basis for avoiding intercourse on certain days to have a healthy baby \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
