  "question": "What is the view of Islam regarding the wearing of a poppy in Britain to commemorate the soldiers of the world wars?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is haraam (strictly prohibited) for a Muslim to wear a poppy to\ncommemorate the soldiers of World Wars. That is not even permissible to do\nin honour of the Mujaahideen, who are greatly honoured in the sight of Allah\ndue to sacrificing their lives for the pleasure of Allah. Very often, world\nsoldiers have been used as tools by the enemies of Islam to attack Islam, as\nis also the present situation in Afghanistan. The soldiers of the coalition\nforces are being used as a tool by the enemies of Islam. It is also ironical\nthat world soldiers of the past are being honoured now. The purpose may well\nbe to motivate the soldiers of the coalition forces in Afghanistan. It is\ntherefore haraam for any Muslim to participate in the commemorating\nceremony.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
