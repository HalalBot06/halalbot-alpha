  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen I talk to my fiancé while I?m fasting, my semen comes out unintentionally. Does that make me brake my fast? Is the only solution for me not to talk to her while fasting? By the way, I talk to her on the phone.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for you to talk to her, whether you are fasting or not.\n\nBy ?unintentionally? we understand that you did not do anything physically. In that case, the fast has not broken. In future, one should adopt extreme precaution in such matters.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT"
