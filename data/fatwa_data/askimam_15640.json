  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCould you please explain what are the things we need to take care according to Sharia for a new born baby (Boy/Girl), just after his birth onwards?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nWhen a child is born, the first thing that should be done is to call out the Azaan in the right ear and Iqaamah in the left ear. There are four things mentioned in the Ahadith that are Sunnah to be done on the seventh day:\n\n1.         Name the child with a good meaning.\n2.         Make Aqeeqah for the child that is to slaughter 2 goats or sheep for a boy and 1 sheep or goat for a girl.\n3.         Shave the hair of the child.\n4.         Weigh the hair that has been shaven off and give sadaqah (charity) equivalent to the weight of the hair. (Tirmidhi, vol.1, chapter on Aqeeqah).\n\nIt is Sunnah to make Tahneek, i.e. place something sweet that has been chewed preferably by some pious person in the mouth of the baby.\n\nIt is not necessary to do the circumcision on the seventh day. However, it is preferable to do it as early as possible.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
