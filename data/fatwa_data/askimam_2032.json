  "question": "What was the exact way in which our Prophet (S.A.W)performed the Salaat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Mufti Saheb. It is observed today that the Salaat is performed in many different ways (e.g Raf-ul-Yaddein, Saying Ameen loudly, etc.). It is also known that more than 500.000 Hadiths have been memorised, and are known to us. What I cannot grasp is how words said by our Prophet(S.A.W) only once in his lifetime have been memorised while the Salaat which was performed 5 times a day is today performed so differently?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn actual fact, the many number of Ahaadith refers to the very many chain of\nnarrators for each Hadith. For example, if one Hadith has fifty chain of\nnarrators, it is regarded as fifty Ahaadith whereas it is the one and same\nHadith.\n\nNevertheless, the different procedures of performing Salaat has no bearing\non the many or less number of Ahaadith known to us. It is based on the\nconclusion of the great and illustrious Mujtahideen who were oceans of\nknowledge who have researched the different Ahaadith narrated on a\nparticular matter based on their vast knowledge. The different conclusions\nshould be interpreted as intellectual honesty.\n\nIt would be intellectually dishonest for them to unite on a particular\nmethod of performing Salaat contrary to their research. Hence, the different\nmethods of Salaat is a reflection of the honesty of the noble Mujtahideen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFA"
