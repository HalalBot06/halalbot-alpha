Jazakallah khair. wassalam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer attached.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe only difference between Tamattu Hajj and Qiraan is that after Umrah, a%0D%0Aperson will still remain in Ihraam.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0AHAJJ BOOKLET%0D%0A(Here I am, O God, at Thy command. Here I am! Thou art without associates, Thine are praise and grace and dominion. Thou art without associates, here I am!)%0D%0A%0D%0ADear Reader%0D%0A%0D%0AOf the three types of Hajj, we outline the procedure for Hajj at%ADTamattu', for it is the most recommended. In this type, one is to perform Umrah during the Hajj months (i.e., Shawwal, Thul Qa'dah and the first thirteen nights of Thul Hijjah) and to perform the Hajj in the same year with a sacrifice slaughtered in Mina on one of the days of Eid al-Adhha. One may remove his Ihram garments and resume his normal activities between Umrah and Hajj. But one makes the Tawaf and the Sa'i twice, the first time for Umrah and the second time for Hajj. This booklet is designed to be used as a handy reference, but it cannot be a substitute for thoroughly studying Hajj and sincerely preparing oneself for this great Ibadah. Please refer to the map in this booklet to follow the sequence of the rites. Allah is the giver of success. May His blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad and all of his family and companions.%0D%0A%0D%0A?The first Sanctuary appointed for mankind was that at Mecca, a blessed place, a guidance to the peoples; Wherein are plain memorials of God's guidance; the place where Abraham stood up to pray, and whosoever entereth it is safe. And Pilgrimage to the House is a duty unto God for mankind, for him who can find a way thither. As for him who disbelieveth, let him know that lo! God is Independent of all creatures.' [3:96-97]%0D%0A%0D%0AONE - IHRAM%0D%0AIhram is the intention of the person willing to perform all rites of Umrah, Hajj or both when he arrives at the Miqat. Each direction coming into Makkah has its own Miqat. It is recommended that one makes Ghusl, wear perfumes if he chooses on his body, but not the garments, and puts on a two piece garment with no headgear. The garments should be of seamless pieces of cloth. One piece to cover the upper part of the body, and another to cover the lower part. For a woman Ihram is similar except that she should not use perfumes at all and her dress should cover the whole body decently, leaving the hands and the face uncovered. Then one should utter intention according to the type of Hajj. For Tamatt'u one may say, \"Labbayka Allahumma Umrah\" which means \"O Allah I answered Your call to perform Umrah.\" It is recommended to repeat the Hajj supplication, called Talbiyah, as frequently as possible from the time of Ihram till the time of the first stoning of Jamrat al-Aqabah in Mina (10th of Thul Hijjah). Men are recommended to utter the Talbiyah aloud while women are to say it quietly%0D%0A%0D%0ATWO ? UMRAH%0D%0ATawaf: Upon arrival to Makkah, make Tawaf around the Ka'bah. Circle the Ka'bah seven times in the counterclock%ADwise direction, starting from the black stone with Takbeer and ending each circle at the Black Stone with Takbeer. The Ka'bah will be to your left. Get to Maqam Ibrahim (Ibrahim's Station) as close as possible and make two rak'at. Be sure to face the Ka'bah while praying. %0D%0A%0D%0ASa'i: Next make Sa'i between Safa and Marwah. Start by ascending the Safa hill. Facing the Ka'bah praise Allah, raise his hands and make Takbeer three times, then you may supplicate to Allah whatever you want. Descend and head towards the Marwah. Increase your pace between the clearly marked green posts (called ar-Ram]), but should walk at a normal pace before and after them. At the Marwah, ascend, praise Allah and do as he did at the Safa. This is one complete round and so is the other way from Marwah to Safa. A total of seven rounds are required.%0D%0A%0D%0AHair: Once done, end Umrah by shaving your head or trimming your hair (women should cut a finger tip's length from their hair). At this stage, the prohibitions pertaining to the state of Ihram are lifted and you can resume your normal life.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHREE ? GOING TO MINA%0D%0AA Muslim performing Hajjut Tamattu' should intend to go into the state of Ihram, from the place where he is staying in Makkah, on the eighth day of Thul-Hijjah, which is called the Tarwiyah Day, and leave to Mina in the morning. In Mina, perform Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib and Isha salah of the eighth day and Fajr salah of the ninth day of Thul Hijjah. Dhuhr, Asr and Isha salah are each shortened to two rak'at only, but are not combined. Remain in Mina until sunrise of the ninth day then leave to Arafat. Make sure you use the time wisely because many people will go instead for long walks trying to see things around in Mina. This is the main reason behind many Muslims getting lost in their way back and ending up wasting most of their time.%0D%0A%0D%0AFOUR ? DEPART TO ARAFAAT%0D%0AAt Arafat, stay until sunset. Make salah of Dhuhr and Asr shortened and combined during the time of Dhuhr to save the rest of the day for remembering and glorifying Allah and for supplication for forgiveness, etc. Make certain that you stay within the boundaries of Arafat, not necessarily standing on the mountain of Arafat. Keep reciting Talbiyah, glorifying Allah the Greatest and repeating supplication. It is also reported that the Prophet sallallaahu alayhe wasallam, used to say the following supplication: \"There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah, the One without a partner. The dominion and the praise are His and He is powerful over everything.\" Anas ibn Malik was asked once how he and his friends used to spend their time while walking from Mina to Arafat in the company of Prophet, sallallaahu alayhi wasallam. Anas said, 'Some of us used to cry out Talbiyah. others used to glorify Allah the Greatest and the rest used to repeat prayers. Each one of us was free to worship Allah in the way he likes without prejudice or renunciation of his right.\" (Bukhari)%0D%0A%0D%0AFIVE ? A NIGHT IN MUZDALIFAH%0D%0ASoon after sunset at Arafat, leave for Muzdalifah quietly and reverently The Prophet sallallaahu alayhi wasallam, said when he noticed people walking hurriedly, \"O people! Be quiet, hastening is not a sign of righteousness.\" (Bukhari) Keep reciting the Talbiyah, glorifying and remembering. In Muzdalifah perform Maghrib and Isha combined, shortening the Isha to two rak'at. Stay overnight in Muzdalifah to perform the salatul Fajr and keep busy supplicating waiting for the brightness of the morning becomes widespread then leave to Mina passing through the sacred Mash'ar valley. Women and weak individuals are allowed to proceed to proceed to Mina at any time after midnight to avoid the crowd. Start collecting pebbles for stoning the Jamaarat.%0D%0A%0D%0ASIX ? RETURN TO MINA (day of Eid)%0D%0AStoning Jamrat Al-Aqabah: At Mina, go to Jamrat al-Aqabah to stone it with seven pebbles making Takbeer, \"Allahu Akbar\" at each throw and calling on Allah to accept your Hajj. The time of stoning Jamrat al-Aqabah starts after sun%ADrise. The Prophet, sallallaahu alayhi wasallam, threw the pebbles late in the morning and permitted weak people to stone after leaving Muzdalifah after midnight. The size of the pebbles should not be more than that of a chick pea.%0D%0A%0D%0ASlaughter of Sacrifice: Next, slaughter your sacrifice either personally or, through the appointment of someone who will do it on your behalf.%0D%0A%0D%0AShaving the head or trimming the hair: Shave your head or trim some hair. Shaving, however, is preferable. Women can cut a finger tip length of their hair. Finishing these rites ends the first phase of the state of Ihram and lifts its restrictions except for resuming conjugal relationship.%0D%0A%0D%0ASEVEN - DAYS OF TASHREEQ%0D%0A10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th of Dhul Hijjah%0D%0ATawaf al-Ifadhah: Tawaf al-Ifadhah is a fundamental rite of Hajj. Go to Makkah, circle the Ka'bah seven times, perform two rak'at behind Maqam Ibrahim and finish with Sa'i between the Safa and the Marwah. On completion, the state of Ihram is completely lifted. Tawaf al-Ifadhah can be done anytime during the Tashreeq days or delayed until the days spent at Mina are over.%0D%0A%0D%0AEIGHT ? STAYING IN MINA%0D%0ASpend there the days of Tashreeq in Mina. During each day, and after Dhuhr stone the three stone the Jamarat (the small, the medium and Jamrat al-Aqabah). You may leave Mina to Makkah on the 12th or on the 12th. If you choose the later, leave before sunset.%0D%0A%0D%0ANINE - FAREWELL TAWAF%0D%0AThe Tawaf of Farewell is the final rite of Hajj. Ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) said, ?The people were ordered to perform the Tawaf around the Ka?bah as the last thing (to do) before leaving Makkah, except for the menstruating women who were excused.? (Bukhari)%0D%0A%0D%0AA REMINDER%0D%0A1. Commit all of your time to Ibaadah. Remember the goal of Hajj. Make a lot of Du?aa%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Stick to righteous deeds. Avoid prohibitions.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. All of the rites must be done correctly. If you do not know how to perform an act, ask.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Never harm any Muslim with words or actions within the Mashaa-ir or elsewhere.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Know the restrictions of Ihram, avoid them. A) No hair or nails trimming, b) No perfume. Avoid scented soap, c) No conjugal relation with spouse, d) No wedding or proposing a woman for yourself or others, e) No gloves. If necessary wrap your hands in cloth, f) No cover on head that touches it, umbrellas are OK, g) No shoes, shirts, turban, hooded cloaks, trousers, or the like, h) Sandals, rings, glasses, hearing aids, watch, or speech aid are OK, i) Bathing, washing and scratching the body and head, even if some of his hair falls unintentionally are OK, j) Women cannot wear a Niqab or Burqa.%0D%0A%0D%0ALabbaik Allaahumma labbaik. Labbaika laa shareeka laka labbaika. Innal hamda, wanni?mata laka wal mulk laka. Laa shareeka laka%0D%0A%0D%0A(Here I am, O God, at Thy command. Here I am! Thou art without associates, Thine are praise and grace and dominion. Thou art without associates, here I am!)"
