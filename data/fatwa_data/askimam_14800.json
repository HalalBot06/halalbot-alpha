  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n I feel like a faliure in this world, i want to do so much for the deen and also duniya but i fee like i am a loser. I want to also work to help islam and also i want to go in duniya like having a job but i am so behind. Sometime i feel like i can comepte this world. I ask Allah for help and clue but i don't know when will i be helped. But i have faith, however i feel guilty of being no wher not for this world and hereafter! plz tell me some dua so i can be helped!\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nOne is a feeling and the other is a reality.There is a world of difference between the two.Feelings could be wrong, not a reality. Feelings are the effects and whisperings of Shaitaan.You are a married woman.Your Feelings of being a failure is incorrect.It is a whisper of the Shaitaan.The reality is you are a very successful person.This has to be judged in terms of Islamic Values.As a wife and being indoors, you are complying with the order of Allah Ta’ala to remain in the confines of your home.For every moment you are in the house, you are being rewarded by Allah Ta’ala.\nYou can never be a failure while you are complying with the order of Allah Ta’ala.To think of yourself as a failure is being ungrateful to Allah Ta’ala.Allah Ta’ala has given you the Tawfeeq to comply with His orders. Many women are out of their homes.Some are out due to the modern and western trend and not out of necessity which is considered in Shariah.Such women think they are progressing whereas the reality is the exact opposite.They are violating the law of Allah Ta’ala.\nTo regard such women as progressive and successful as opposed to you staying in the house and fulfilling the household chores and serving your husband is equivalent to being ungrateful to Allah’s bounty unto yourself.The attitude of Islam and women remaining in the confines of their homes and fulfilling the household duties is envied by working women.\nThe reports of frustration and health hazards from such women should serve as an eye opener to you.\nThank Allah and make Shukr to him for His bounty upon you.You are not a failure.You are in the confines of your home and obeying the order of Allah Ta’ala.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
