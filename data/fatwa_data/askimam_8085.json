  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf anyone wanted to fast on days like the day of arafat & aashooraa because of the great reward u get for fasting on these days but could not for reasons that were not in his or her hands what is the ruling about this person? Will they have more sins than everyone else who had the chance to fast , since the people who could fast had thier minor sins forgiven for the upcoming/previous years?

The person who intended to fast but was unable to do so will, Insha Allah, get the reward of fasting.\n\n2.
