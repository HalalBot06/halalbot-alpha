  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni visit mosque five times a day. The imam of that mosque runs a madrassah the students are taught quran inside the praying place. The students also have to give a fee so i wanted to ask that is it a business? if yes then is it allowed to run such business in a mosque??\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIn general, it is not permissible for a person taking wages to teach in the masjid, when his sole purpose is to benefit from the income. However, if a person has the benefit of the students in mind and does not have any other place to teach, then it will be permissible for him to teach in the masjid on the following conditions:\n\n·        He should be content with the minimal wages received for teaching.\n\n·        His teaching should not be a hindrance to the other i’badaat taking place in the masjid, like salaah, zikr, tilawat of Quaran, etc.\n\n·        The integrity and the cleanliness of the masjid should be borne in mind.\n\n·        Very small children, who are not aware of the integrity of the masjid, should not be permitted in the masjid.\n\nThe abovementioned ruling is when the fee charged from the students is directly given to the Imam. However, if the fee is acquired by the mutawallis of the masjid for the well-being of the masjid, and the Imam receives wages for being an Imam, then it will be permissible to teach in the masjid in all respects.\n\nAhsanul Fatawa Vol:6 Pg:458 (H.M.
