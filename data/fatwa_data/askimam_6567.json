  "question": "Can Ihraam be washed with normal washing powder and fabric softner ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWill this not add fragrance to the Imraam which is prohibited. If it has already been washed, what can be done ? Jazakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allaah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nIt is permissible to apply perfume, etc. before entering the state of Ihraam. Hence, to put on an Ihraam that is giving off a fragrance is permissible as a person is not in the state of Ihraam as yet. \n\n\nOnce a person is in the state of Ihraam, the use of scented items is prohibited.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n(2002-12-05)"
