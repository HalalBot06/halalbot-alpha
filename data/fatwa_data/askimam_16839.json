  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nHow does one know whether he has had a wet dream or not? I am 15 years old and I have very heavy sleep, so sometimes I suspect that something might have happened, but I'm not sure. How does one confirm whther he needs to make ghusl? And if there is a suspicion, should I still make gusl again?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nGenerally there are two emissions [wetness] a person may observe on awakening which will render Ghusl Wajib.\n\n1. Mani or sperm:\n\nAn emission of a thick white fluid normally at the time of intercourse or at the time of a wetdream.\n\n2. Mazi or pre-coital fluid:\n\nAn emission of a thin white fluid before intercourse at the time of foreplay.\n\nWe catalog hereunder the different cases of Mani and Mazi a person may experience upon awakening with there respected rulings;\n\nWetness\n\n\t\n\nDream\n\n\t\n\nRulings\n\n\n\n\n1. Mani\n\n\t\n\nDream\n\n\t\n\nGhusl Wajib\n\n\n\n\n2. Mazi\n\n\t\n\nDream\n\n\t\n\nGhusl Wajib\n\n\n\n\n3. Mani\n\n\t\n\nNo Dream\n\n\t\n\nGhusl Wajib\n\n\n\n\n4. Mazi\n\n\t\n\nNo Dream\n\n\t\n\nGhusl NotÂ  Wajib\n\n\n\n\n1. Doubt-Mani or Wazi\n\n\t\n\nDream\n\n\t\n\nGhusl Wajib\n\n\n\n\n2. Doubt-Mani or Wazi\n\n\t\n\nNo Dream\n\n\t\n\nGhusl Wajib\n\nExample of how the catalog works: From the right, column # 1, upon awakening a person saw wetness, and knows its Mani. Column # 2 and he had a dream. Column # 3 then the ruling is Gushl becomes Wajib.\n\n(Hashiyatu Al-Tahtawi, Pg, 99. Dar-Al-Kutub Al- Ilmiyah)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
