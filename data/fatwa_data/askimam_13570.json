  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni read that water entering vagina nullifies fast. can you kindly explain what it means. does that mean that after urinating or relieving herself she washes herself and water enters her vagina or is it something else. i am confused. what is considered water entering vagina?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe inner part of the vagina is regarded as the inner part part of the body, like the inner part of the mouth (throat).\n\nIf water enters the inner part of the vagina at any time (generally when washing after relieving) that nullifies the fast.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
