  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI do prayers and every other in islam. but i have realli bad thoughts in my heard which can not get ride of tell if there is a hadith about this and what the prophet said pbuh\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nRasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) is reported to have said that whoever has bad thoughts should recite La Hawla Wala Quwwata Illa Billah. Apart from reciting this Dua, it is important that you consult with reliable Ulama in your area or nearby who can assist you. Shaytaan uses this type of deceptive methods to avoid you from carrying out your Ibaadat (worship) with concentration and devotion. Do not become frustrated and leave the Ibaadat as you will make Shaytaan successful in his plot. Together with the above Dua, recite Istighfaar as much as possible.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
