  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti, whilst fasting is it necessary to avoid the inhalation of talcum powder and spray emanating from an aerosol eg a deodorant? What I mean is when applying these things they always DO get into your mouth and nose (although not a substantial amount). It?s impossible to avoid it unless you cover your face. So, do these things break the fast?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, anything going down the throat while fasting nullifies the fast.\n\nIf the talcum powder or aerosol does not go down the throat, it will not nullify the fast.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
