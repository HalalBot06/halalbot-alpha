  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan I feed a pet , pet food bought from the supermarket, Husky etc.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf the pet in reference is a dog, then we wish to point out that it is not permissible to keep a dog as a pet. It will only be permissible to keep a dog for hunting, guarding, farming etc. Nevertheless, the pet-food that is sold in the supermarkets contains Haram ingredients such as meat which is not slaughtered according to the laws of Shari’a. Such meat is considered as carrion hence, it will not be permissible to purchase such food or to feed it to animals. (Fatawa Hindiya, vol. 5 pg. 361, Maktaba Rashidiya / Fatawa Rahimiya, vol. 9 pg. 138, Dar al-Isha’at)\n\nرجل ذبح كلبه أو حماره جاز أن يطعم سنوره من ذلك وليس له أن يطعمه خنزيره أو شيئا من الميتة كذا في السراجية ( الفتاوى الحندية )\n\nAs an alternative, you can consider purchasing non-meat pet food for animals if available, prepare your own dog food with Halal ingredients or feed the animals your leftovers. In this manner the food will not go to waste and the animal will be fed.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
