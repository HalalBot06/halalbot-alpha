  "question": "How can I concentrate in my salaah with my eyes open?Clarification of having pants below ankles",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamualaikum Dear Mufti Sahab, 1)I know that you have to read salaah with the eyes open, but it?s very distracting, therefore can I leave my eyes open just a little bit and try to make this blurry and blink them a lot to concentrate more? What is the consequence of leaving the eyes closed in salaah, I heard that if one does this, his hoor in jannah will be blind?2) Is peelu miswak the best miswaaak or the olive miswaak? 3) What is the best place to position the hands During Dua?; like at face level or shoulder level or hands high up? Should our palms be facing upwards? 4)I heard that it is HARAAM to keep the pants or shalwar below the ankles and that Muhammad (S) said whatever is below the ankles will be in jahannum. My brother is saying that this hadeeth only applies to people at that time or even now who used to keep their pants below the ankle for the ske of PRIDE. Does this mean that regular muslims who don?t keep their pants above the ankles (not for pride) will not get punished for this sin? Please clarify.5)Are all synthetic alcohols in products useable no matter where the source of the synthetic alcohol is derived? 6) Should we Only act on Sahih Hadith or act on even the weak hadith too? 7.Can you please give me a detailed description of how the Angels Jibrail, Mikail, Israfil, and Israeel look like if there are any ahadith that speak of their appearance and characteristics.JazkallahMay Allah (SWT) reward u infinitely.Asslaamualaikum.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. To close the eyes while in Salaah is Makrooh Tanzihi but if it is done in order to gain concentration there is no harm. Regarding the consequences of leaving the eyes closed in Salaah, the person?s Hoor in Jannah will be blind. This is not a reliable Hadith. (Ad Durrul Mukhtaar, Vol. 1, Page 477). %0D%0A%0D%0A2. The peelu Miswaak is called Aaraak in Arabic and it is better than olive Miswaak. (Raddul Muhtaar, Vol.1, Page 85, Haashiyatut Tahtawee Page.37). %0D%0A%0D%0A3. The best position of placing the hand during Du?aa is that the hand must be in line with the chest, the palms facing upwards and leaving a space between the two hands. (Fataawaa 'Aalamgeeriyyah, Vol. 5, Page.318). %0D%0A%0D%0A4. The Wa?eed mentioned in the Ahaadith with regards to ?Isbaal? (keeping the pants below the ankles) is of two types. One narration is that ?Isbaal? is Haraam in all cases and in another narration ?Isbaal? is Haraam if it is done with pride. The Ulamaa mention that ?Isbaal? is Haraam in all cases, whether he has the intention of pride or not. Rather they say a person will be sinful for ?Isbaal? but he will be more sinful if it is done with pride. (Nasaai, Vol. 2, Page 298, Imdaadul Fataawaa, Vol. 5 Page. 122). %0D%0A%0D%0A5. The synthetic alcohol which is derived from dates and grapes is Haraam and cannot be consumed nor used externally but those synthetic alcohols which are not derived from these two products can be use externally only at the time of necessity. %0D%0A%0D%0A6. One can also act on a weak Hadith without the intention of it being Sunnah and the Hadith should not be very weak (i.e. in which a chain of narrators is a liar or there is doubt of there being a liar in the chain of narrators. (Ad Durrul Muhtaar, Vol. 1, Page 95) %0D%0A%0D%0A7. The angel Jibreel has six hundred wings. This is all we have found. We have not yet come across any Ahaadith or book describing these Angels. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Ashraf%0D%0ADARUL IFTA ?
