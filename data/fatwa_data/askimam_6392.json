There is abundant reward for marrying someone with a disability. Such an\naction would undoubtedly bring great joy to the disabled person. Bringing\njoy to another Muslim has been rated as a great form of charity in Islam.\nMost of the wives of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) were either\nwidows or divorcees when they entered into matrimony with him.\n2. Every good deed in Islam is rewardable. Smiling at the wife, touching her\nor even having intercourse with her is a rewardable act.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
