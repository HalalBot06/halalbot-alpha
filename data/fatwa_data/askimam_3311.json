  "question": "What is the Islamic ruling regarding a father in case his children from a Christian wife become Christian? Is it Shirk?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nChristians do not recognize the Islam (Prophet Mohamed \"Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam\" and the Quraan). Meanwhile muslim do recognize the Christianity (Isaa \"Alahis Salam\" and the Bible) and the Judaism (Mossa \"Alayhis Salam\" and the Torah).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala says, 'Verily the (accepted) religion by Allah is Islam.' In%0D%0Aanother verse, Allah Ta'ala says, 'And whosoever searches for a religion%0D%0Abesides Islam, it will not be accepted from him.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIn view of the above, it is clear that Islam does not recognise as presently%0D%0Aaccepted religions, any other religion, including Christianity and Judaism.%0D%0AThey (Christianity and Judaism) were accepted religions of the past. All the%0D%0Apast accepted religions have been permanently replaced by Islam.%0D%0A%0D%0AShari'ah has granted a Muslim male to marry a Christian or Jewish female in%0D%0Aorder to prevail over her and convert her to Islam. The children in such a%0D%0Amarriage will be subordinate of the father, not the mother. If the children%0D%0Adid not learn and follow Islam, that is the weakness of the father. If he%0D%0Awas negligent in their upbringing, then he will be sinful for his children%0D%0Abecoming Christians. It is precisely for such unforeseen but possible%0D%0Acircumstances, Shari'ah discourages marriage to a Christian or Jewish%0D%0Afemale. In today's time of weakness in Imaan, very few Muslim men are able%0D%0Ato prevail over their Christian and Jewish wives.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
