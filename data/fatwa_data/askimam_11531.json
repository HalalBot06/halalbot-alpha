  "question": "Is the prayer Salat Tasbeeh from an authentic hadith?, I ask because the following site has some doubts regarding this prayer www.islam-qa.com (Question 14320).",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaam Alaykum, 1) I had a dream whereby I saw a man walking on a tightrope from one end to another. I was with people on the ground and we were informed this man is none other than our beloved Prophet (SAWS), I did not see a face, however I noticed a beard. Please can you explain this dream? 2) Can you give some examples of where Ulama of Deoband Do not \"agree with the beliefs and actions of Sheikh Abdul Wahhaab\" as stated on your website (Ref#Q8869)? 3) Is the prayer Salat Tasbeeh from an authentic hadith?, I ask because the following site has some doubts regarding this prayer www.islam-qa.com (Question 14320). 4) When reciting Dua Qunoot (Witr) do i have to have my hands folded? or can I have my hands open (as normally done when making dua)? 5) Some Muslims fold there hands when coming up from ruku, is this to be found in hadith?,as I also see on TV the Imam at Mecca do this 6) If Shakyh Nuh Ha Mim Keller & Shakyh Hamza Yusuf are Sufi Shakyh is there techings/lectures according to the mainstream Sunni belief?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. the tight rope is an indication to the deen of Islam. It is straight, absolute and without the slightest deviation. Allah Ta?ala told Nabi [Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam], ?Be firm as you have been ordered.?\n\n2. There are many difference in Aqaid (beliefs) and fiqh between the Deobandis and the Wahabis. Some of the main differences are: - The Wahabis are in essence Mujassimah (anthropomorphists-Those who attribute a body to Allah Ta'ala). They attribute a hand, leg, face etc to Allah Ta'ala, while the illustrious Ulama of Deoband hold fast to the belief of the Ahlus sunnah wal jamah and that is that Allah knows best the meaning of these words. Similar is the case with all the sifat (qualities) etc in the Quran ie. the Wahabis take it on its apparent meaning while we say that Allah knows best what it means or at times we interpret it in a suitable manner.\n-The Wahabis reject the permissiblity of using a deceased person as a intermediary in dua, while we hold that it is permissible.\n-The Wahabis reject the Ambiyaa being alive in their graves\n- The Wahabis hold that Allah is really resting on his throne in the sky, while we hold that this is from the Mutashabihaat.(Those unclear statements hose meaning is only known to Allah).\n- The Ulama of Deoband disagree with the destruction of numerous blessed historical landmarks by the Wahabis.\n-The Ulama of deoband hold that taqleed of one mazhab is necessary, while the Wahabis generally do not adhere to a mazhab and claim that following one imam blindly is Bidah and shirk.\n-There are dozens of other differences.\n\n3. It is proven from Authentic ahadith. See our attached answer. The website in question is a wahabi one which we would not advise anyone to visit.\n\n4.The preferred view in the Hanafi Mazhab is that the hands should be folded.(Tahtaawi alal maraaqi Pg.376-Ilmiyyah)\n\n5. To the best of our knowledge, both Shaikh Nuh and Shaikh Hamza in Aqaid follow the Ashari School, which are part of the Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama'ah. We do differ with them in beliefs slightly, as some of the beliefs propounded by the students of Shaikh Nuh are taken by our Ulama to be those of the Ahle Bidah. Nevertheless, both these scholars are part of the mainstream Sunnis in their beliefs to the best of our knowledge.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
