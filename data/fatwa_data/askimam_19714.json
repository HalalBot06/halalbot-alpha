  "question": "I m the only daughter and my mother is alone and there is no one to look after her, if I bring her to my house then my in laws will complain. What should I do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am the only one daughter of my parent, mean I have no other brother or sister. My father had died six years ago, he passed away some days before my marriage. Now my mother is alone. No one is to care for her, even no relative. If she lives with me then my in-laws have objection although I live with my husband in a separate house. If I say that I should go to my mother house to live with her to take care of her then my husband gets angry. At this stage should I follow my husband and leave my mother alone?\n\nSecond thing I want to ask is that as she has no source of earning because she cannot go outside to work at old age now. She gave a large amount of her deposited money to a share business but with that business a great lost happened and she lost her own money also, now she is not willing to give her remaining money to any other business at any cost. In this condition can she deposit her money in a National saving bank in Pakistan which gives fixed profit at every month and original amount is safe but that fixed profit is said to be Sood and is Zakaat Wajib at her money or not?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykumwa-rahmatullāhiwa-barakātuh.\n\nMarriage is a bond of mutual cooperation. During the married life, many crucial decisions are made that have rippling effects on both spouses.  Hence, consideration and cooperation are main ingredients for a successful marriage.\n\nWith regards to your situation, you should consult with your husband.  Express to him your concern towards your mother.  Explain to him the difficulties your mother is facing without anyone to assist her.  Seek his opinion on the matter. Insha Allah, through this the two of you will come to a solution.\n\nAs we understand from your query that you wish to deposit your money in a National bank of Pakistan so that you may earn a profit.The national bank does not give profit rather they give interest on your money, thus will not be permissible.\n\nWith regards to Zakaat, if the amount of the money is equivalent to the Nisaab of Zakaat then Zakaat will be Wajib on that money.\n\n \n\n \n\n( وَلَا يَمْنَعُهَا مِنْ الْخُرُوجِ إلَى الْوَالِدَيْنِ ) فِي كُلِّ جُمُعَةٍ إنْ لَمْ يَقْدِرَا عَلَى إتْيَانِهَا عَلَى مَا اخْتَارَهُ فِي الِاخْتِيَارِ وَلَوْ أَبُوهَا زَمِنًا مَثَلًا فَاحْتَاجَهَا فَعَلَيْهَا تَعَاهُدُهُ وَلَوْ كَافِرًا وَإِنْ أَبَى الزَّوْجُ فَتْحٌ\n\n( قَوْلُهُ فَعَلَيْهَا تَعَاهُدُهُ ) أَيْ بِقَدْرِ احْتِيَاجِهِ إلَيْهَا ، وَهَذَا إذَا لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ مَنْ يَقُومُ عَلَيْهِ كَمَا قَيَّدَهُ فِي الْخَانِيَّةِ\n\nفتاوى الشامى – ج 3 – ص 602 – 603 – ايج ايم سعيد\n\n \n\nفتاوى محموديه – ج 18 – ص 599- 600\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Hussein Issa,\nStudent of Darul Iftaa\n\nMozambique\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
