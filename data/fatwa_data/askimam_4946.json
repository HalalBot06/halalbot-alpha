  "question": "As salamu alaikum dear Mufti, Ref. Qu 4506",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI sent Qu 4506 in Dec 01, but is unanswered ? I now resubmit it. PLEASE FORGIVE ME IF YOU ALREADY HAVE IT! Please interpret dreams: 1. I dream I see my 9 year old sister. She says to me in a park, ?here is my friend Gabriel. He helps me a lot.? I turn my head; on my side is a human like figure, tall, bulky, and looking sternly at me. His face was greenish tinge, but ?flashy? like after u look at a bright light. I am terrified, and fall into Sajdah towards Qibla, not him, and say something praising Allah. I wake up for Fajr and feel scared and depressed, especially about death. 2. I dream I am in Haram, and see Kabah. But on the side is a pub, with fitnah, and go in and say to a non-muslim boy I know, ?I wish I could destroy this?. Then I go intending Tawaaf, and see a group of Asian teenage girls nearby, but with no Hijab ? I verify if Tawaaf is 7 circuits, but they say, ?no,no,no, you don?t have to do that?, and continue with idol talk and laughter in Haram! Then I look for wudu place, but find a small door, leading to narrow passage to small room with Jews planning something. Then I see a fancy Saudi gathering and sit amongst some people. What does it mean. Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe first dream expresses the need for a fully Islamic environment and\nupbringing for your family. The effect of its negligence was shown to you in\nthe dream.\n\nThe second is a true reaction of the reality of affairs taking place in the\nworld today. There is also an indication that you should increase your\nefforts for Deen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nShaykhul Hadith Moulana Haroon Abbaassommar"
