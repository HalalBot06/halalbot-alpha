  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs you are aware mobile phones are very common.  To be able to answer them, we need a sound to hear.  Some have made the alert tone the azaan.  Some have made the alert tone aytul kursi.  Some have made the alert tone a nasheed.  Such people believe it is better to hear such sounds than the sound of tunes and music.  However the ones that use the tunes and music justify their choice since they believe they are not being be-adab or commiting shirk like those who hear the azaan,ayaahs and nasheeds because if you answer the call and the sentence hasnt finished then it is a sin. e.g\n\nAdhaan\n\nInstead of the full adhaan playing:\nAllah hu Akbar (x4)\nash ha du an la ilaha....(call answered)\n\nNasheed\nAs above\n\nQuran\nWe answer the call before the ayah ends.\n\nPlease clarify this for us.  Is answering the call at such times:\n1)permissible\nand\n 2)preferable to other alternatives. \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nThe trend of having the Azaan, recitation of Quran and Nasheeds as a ringtone has become common. This is not permissible. The Quran was not revealed to be a ringtone nor was the Azaan prescribed to alert one for the mundane task of receiving a call. At times, people who have such ringtones forget to put their mobile off or on silent mode; as a result, it rings in the toilet. This is a gross disrespect to the Azaan and the Holy Quran. Allah has blessed this Ummah with the Azaan as a call towards the great Ibadah of Salaah; to cut oneself off from all worldly affairs and proceed to the Musjid to engage in the worship of Allah alone. The Holy Quran was revealed to be recited, listened to attentively and to take lesson and guidance from it.\n\n \n\nIt is prohibited to use musical tones and music/songs as ringtones. Therefore, those who use music/songs as ringtones are in no way justified by saying that they use such ringtones to avoid showing disrespect to the Azaan and recitation of the Holy Quran. Some of these ringtones contain vulgar and explicit lyrics. Some take pleasure in listening to such ringtones; others even dance to it. This is clearly violating the law of Allah Ta’ala and one who does so is sinful.\n\n \n\nAs an alternative, one should use a standard ringtone (which is not musical), vibration, beeps, a voice recording or sounds of, for example, water flowing, birds chirping etc. After all, the purpose of the tone is to alert one of incoming calls, and only lasts for a few seconds.\n\n \n\nRelated to the subject; another discrepancy which has crept into our society is the Holy Quran being recited in the vehicle whist the driver and the passengers engage in idle talk. This is a grave disrespect to the Holy Quran. When the Quran is recited, complete attention should be given to its recitation.\n\n Allah states in the Holy Quran:\n\nوَإِذَا قُرِئَ الْقُرْآَنُ فَاسْتَمِعُوا لَهُ وَأَنْصِتُوا لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ\n\n \n\n“And when the Quran is recited, listen attentively and remain silent so that you may be showered with the Mercy (of Allah).” Surah A’raaf v.204\n\n \n\nIn conclusion, the Quran should be shown utmost reverence as it is the word of Allah himself. It is a blessing and mercy to this Ummah. The more respect we show to the Quran, the more blessing and guidance we will attain from it.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
