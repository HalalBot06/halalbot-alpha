  "question": "If it's not permissible to give the interest amount to my muslim brother, kindly let me know to whom all I can give the interest amount without the intention of thawaab.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have an interest amount in my savings bank account. One of my muslim friend has taken a loan from the bank by keeping his jewels as security. While repaying, he has to pay the principle amount along with the interest to get his jewels back. I'd like to know if I can give the interest amount which I have in my bank to my friend only for paying the interest and not for paying the principle amount. He'd repay the principle amount by some other means and not from the interest amount which I give to him.\n\nIf it's not permissible to give the interest amount to my muslim brother, kindly let me know to whom all I can give the interest amount without the intention of thawaab.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nAt the outset, it is not permissible for you to earn interest money in your bank account if it possible for you to deposit your money in an interest-free account.  However, if that is not possible, then you may deposit your money in an interest-bearing account due to the necessity of safeguarding one's wealth [i].\n\n \n\nIn principle, it is necessary to return interest money to its original owner.  If that is not possible, then it should be given to the poor and the needy without the intention of thawāb [ii]. \n\n \n\nTherefore, it is not permissible for you to give the interest money you have earned to your friend.  However, if he is in such a debt that it becomes permissible for him to accept zakāh, then you may give him the money without the intention of thawāb, as mentioned above [iii]. \n\n \n\n[i]\n\n(فتاوى محمودية، كتاب البيوع، باب الربا: 16/312-313؛ فاروقية)\n\n \n\n[ii]\n\nالواجب حقا للشرع رد عين الربا لو قائما لا رد ضمانه\n\n(البحر الرائق، كتاب البيوع، باب الربا: 6/125؛ رشيدية)\n\n \n\nوإنما الذي يجب حقا للشرع رد عين الربا إن كان قائما لا رد ضمانه\n\n(رد المحتار كتاب البيوع، باب الربا، مطلب في الإبراء عن الربا: 5/169؛ سعيد)\n\n \n\n[iii]\n\n(فتاوى رحيمية، باب الربا: 9/270؛ الإشاعة)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
