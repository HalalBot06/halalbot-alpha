  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am software engg I got a project which is to put the films of international film festival on internet? The earnings from this is permissilbe or it is Haram ? Jazakallah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta?ala says, ?And do not assist in sin?? (Maaidah)\n\nThe festivals of Kuffaar have many un-Islamic in them. To film and place such festivals on the internet will be assisting in spreading the evils of such festivals, therefore, not permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
