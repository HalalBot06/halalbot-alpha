  "question": "People have said that there are fabricated hadiths in ihya ulum ud din. Is this true?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPeople say Imam Ghazzali fabricated them to support sufism. I find that hard to believe. They also say that he uses weak hadith. Please explain the role of weak hadith. Should we use them or not??\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe fact that fabricated Ahaadith are quoted in Ihya Ulumidddin cannot be%0D%0Arefuted. Imam Muhammad Murtadha al-Zabeedi (RA) - the famous and renown%0D%0Acommentator of 'Ihya' has mentioned the following in the forward of his%0D%0Acommentary on 'Ihya', 'Verily the Ahaadith mentioned by the author (Imaam%0D%0AGhazaaly RA) vary between those that are unanimously accepted, Sahih%0D%0A(authentic) and Hasan (sound) . and of them are some that are weak and some%0D%0Aa fabrication though very few.' (Itihaafu saadatil muttaqeen vol.1 pg.38;%0D%0AIlmiyyah)%0D%0A%0D%0AFor quotations of other Ulama which support the above, refer to the above%0D%0Amentioned reference.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, the blasphemous accusation of Imaam Ghazzaaly (RA) having%0D%0Afabricated those Ahaadith is definitely incorrect. The proof for this is%0D%0Athat these Ahaadith were prevalent even before Imaam Ghazzaaly (RA) was%0D%0Aborn. The reason for Imaam Ghazzaaly (RA) having included such Ahaadith in%0D%0Ahis most beneficial work, is the fact that he did know of their fabrication.%0D%0AShaykh Abdul-Fattaah Abu Ghuddah (RA) states in 'Atta'aleeqaatul Haafilah'%0D%0Apg.118, 'Imaam Ghazzaaly (RA) was unique in regards to the knowledge of%0D%0AJurisprudence, its principles, Tasawwuf, beliefs, philosophy and others%0D%0Aexcept for the knowledge of Hadith, for verily he did not spare time to%0D%0Amaster it. And he has mentioned regarding himself in his book, 'Qaanoonut ta%0D%0A'aweel' (pg.16), 'And my knowledge of Hadith is but scanty.'%0D%0A%0D%0AShaykh Abdul Fattaah further states another reason for this, 'Perhaps his%0D%0Aexcuse for doing that (i.e. including fabrications in Ihyaa) is that he%0D%0Arelied on the book, 'Qootul Quloob' of Abu Taalib Makki and he mentioned%0D%0Athose Ahaadith therefrom.' (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0AAs for the role of weak Ahaadith, Imaam Sakhawi (RA) has mentioned in his%0D%0Abook, 'Al-Qawlul Badee' (pg.473): 'Regarding weak narrations there are 3%0D%0Aviews, a) It cannot be accepted at all, b) It will be accepted if there are%0D%0Ano other Ahaadith to substantiate that particular chapter %2F topic, and c) It%0D%0Awill be accepted for virtues of deeds and not for the different laws in%0D%0AShari'ah.' Imam Sakhawi further states: 'And this (third view) is the view%0D%0Aof the majority.%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Abdul Hayy Laknawi (RA) further comments regarding the credibility%0D%0Aof these 3 views in his book, 'Al-ajwibatul faadhilah' (pg.53). He says%0D%0Aregarding the first view, 'It is a weak view.' And regarding the second%0D%0Aview, 'It is an absurd exploitation.' And regarding the third view, 'It is%0D%0Athe straight path.'%0D%0A%0D%0ASo, the answer to your question is, 'Yes' a weak Hadith can be used, but%0D%0Aonly to ascertain a virtue for a specific deed. However, even in doing so%0D%0Athere are some conditions that apply.
