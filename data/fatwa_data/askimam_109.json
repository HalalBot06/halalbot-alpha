  "question": "What is the significance of the 786 as used by many Muslims?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe numerals 786 in no way represent ?Bismillaah al-Rahmaan al-Raheem? and is not the Sunnat way. If one fears abuse of the letter, etc. ?Bismillaah al-Rahmaan al-Raheem? should be recited verbally at the beginning of the letter which will suffice for the written script.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
