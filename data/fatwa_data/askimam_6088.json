  "answer": "QUESTION\ni have heard that before every farz prayer if there are sunnats they are not compulsory .Can you give any Ahadith or explanation and tell us which sunnats are muakkadah and which are ghair muakkadah .I mean which are compulsory and which are not, for every five prayers in islam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are five obligatory prayers upon a Muslim everyday and 3 Rakat Witr\nSalaat after Esha Salaat which is Waajib (necessary). Above that there are\n12 Sunnat-e-Muakkadah.\n\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) says, 'Whosoever recites 12 Rakaat\nextra besides the compulsory prayers, Allah will build a house for him in\nJannat. They are four before Dhukr and 2 after Dhuhr, 2 after Maghrib, 2\nafter Esha and 2 before Fajr. Besides these 12 Sunnat-e-Muakkadah, the rest\nare Ghayr-e-Muakkadah, e.g. 4 Rakaats before Asr and 4 before Esha.\n(Tahtaawi pg.212)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
