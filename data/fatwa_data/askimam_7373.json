  "question": "i would like to know that is zakaat payable on gold plated jewellery and also i have gold plated dinner sets 4 my home which i hardly use do i pay zakaah on these?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nalso there is a doubt concerning jewellery that one utilises daily and the stored away ones.do u pay zakaat on all jewellery wheter or not u r using it or not?where i the quran or hadith does this appear.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nGold plating is a thin layer of real gold over some other metal. One only has to pay Zakaat on the actual gold content. Consult with a jeweler to determine the actual gold content.\n\nGenerally, in gold plating, the actual gold content is minimal. Zakaat has to be paid on all gold and silver jewellery, whether it is worn or put away. The Ahaadith mention that Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) saw some women wearing gold jewellery and he commanded them to pay Zakaat. (Dars Tirmidhi vol.2 pg.452)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
