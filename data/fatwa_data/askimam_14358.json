  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI was wondering how would a person make up for the salats he hasÂ  missed. I haven't been praying for the past few years and dont know exactly how many salaat i have missed. How would i make up for the missed salaats? Can you please give me a clear answer to how i would do this.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to Shariah, if one is not sure of how many Salaah he/she has missed, one will apply his/her discretion and estimate the possible number of missed Salaah. Thereafter one must make up for the missed Salaah accordingly. The manner of making up for the missed Salaah is that one would make the intention that I am performing the first Fajr Salaah that I have missed. Thereafter in this manner continue with the next and the next. The same principle will be adopted for all the remaining Salaah.\n\nAn easy method to complete all the missed Salaah is that after performing the current Fardh Salaah, perform the missed Salaah of that particular Salaah. In this manner over a period of time all the missed Salaah will be completed.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
