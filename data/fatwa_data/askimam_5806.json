  "question": "Why do Muslims wipe their face with both hands when reciting the Kalima, or at the end of a Duâ€™aa? Why some kiss their thumbnails and rub their eyes at the mention of the name Muhammad S.A.W.S.?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhy do some Muslims kiss the Qur?an and touch it to their eyes or forehead before and/or after reading it?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is narrated in Tirmidhi that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Ashould not lower his hands after making Du'aa except after passing them over%0D%0Ahis face. This Hadith is supported by many other Ahaadith. (Bulooghul Maraam%0D%0AHadith 1595)%0D%0A2. The aforementioned practice is unfortunately very widespread in different%0D%0Aparts of the world. Consequently, it has been based on a narration which has%0D%0Abeen classified as a fabrication by the masters of Hadith, i.e. Hafiz%0D%0ASakhawi (RA) (AlMaqaasidul Hasana pg.450); Hafiz Ibnuddaiba (Tamyeez uthayba%0D%0Apg.171-2); Hafiz Ibn Taahir al-Fattaany (Tazkiratul Mawdhoo'aat pg.34);%0D%0AShaykh Abdul Fattah Abu Ghuddah (footnotes on Al-Masnoo of Mulla Ali Qari%0D%0Apg.169) and others. Considering such an action to be Waajib, Sunnat or as%0D%0Apart of Deen is wrong.%0D%0A3. It is narrated from ibn Malaaikah that Ikramah ibn Abi Jahl (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhu) should touch the Qur'aan to his face and say this is the speech of my%0D%0Alord. This is the speech of my Lord. This practice is not a Sunnah, rather%0D%0Ait is done for respect and love for the noble Qur'aan and words of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
