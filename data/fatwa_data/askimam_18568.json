  "question": "Allahu Akbar",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nWe begin our prayer with the word ‘Allah-o-Akbar’ which means ‘Allah is Greatest’.\n\nThe word ‘Akbar’ is used in Quran in many verses, some of them are 6:78, 4:153, 3:118, 2:219, 2:217, 9:3, 9:72, 10:61, 12:31, 16:41, 17:21, 29:45. This word is translated by different English translators as ‘worse’, ‘great’, ‘greater’ and ‘greatest’ etc.\n\nThe common factor in all the translations is that this word is used to compare one thing with others.\n\nWhen we say ‘Allah is Greatest’ this gives an impression that there are several gods and Allah is the greatest among them (Naooz-u-billah). In verse 29:45 this word is used for Allah SWT as ‘and remembrance of Allah is the greatest’. This verse is telling that we can compare the remembrance of Allah SWT with other remembrance but we cannot find a single place where Quran said that Allah is Akbar.\n\nI think we should not say ‘Allah is greatest’ for at least two reasons.\n\n1. Allah did not use Akbar for Himself.\n\n2. Verse ‘112:4 And there is none comparable unto Him’ is announcing that You cannot compare Allah SWT.\n\nSince I understood it I feel that I am doing Shirk.\n\nWhy our scholars think differently?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nThe word  \"اكبر\" comes on the superlative scale, which is generally used to show superiority of one thing over the other. The word \"ألله أكبر\" is translated as “Allah is the Greatest”. However, in this case it does not come to show comparison i.e. that there are multiple lords (nauzubillah) and Allah is the greatest amongst them.\n\nThere is no need for you to feel that you are making shirk. The words \"ألله أكبر\" are used in the Adhaan, Salaah and other occasions. Even though \"ألله أكبر\" has not been expressly mentioned in the Quran, it has been narrated in the books of Hadith.  A few examples are:\n\n1) When Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) approached Khaibar he remarked “Allah hu Akbar! Kaibar has been destroyed”.\n\nSahih Bukhari, vol.1, pg.112, Darul Fikr[1]\n\n2) Once Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) commented on the faith of a person. When the Sahabah brought information confirming what he had told them he  said: “Allah hu Akbar, I bear witness that I am the servant of Allah and his messenger”\n\nSahih Bukhari, vol.4, pg.42, Darul Fikr[2]\n\n\n3) When the rumour went around that Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) divorced his wives, Ummar (Radiyallahu anhu) came to Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) and asked him: Did you divorce your wives? Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) replied: No. thereafter Ummar (Radiyallahu anhu) said: \"ألله أكبر\"\n\n Sahih Bukh ari, vol.1, pg.36, Darul Fikr[3]\n\nFurthermore, by saying \"ألله أكبر\", it does not imply that there are other lords and Allah is the greatest.\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftāa\n\n\n\n\n[1] قال فلما رآهم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال الله أكبر الله أكبر خربت خيبر إنا إذا نزلنا بساحة قوم فساء صباح المنذرين  (صحيح البخاري, (باب ما يحقن بالأذان من الدماء)\n\n[2] فأخبر النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم بذلك فقال الله أكبر أشهد أني عبد الله ورسوله ثم أمر بلالا فنادى بالناس إنه لا يدخل الجنة إلا نفس مسلمة وإن الله ليؤيد هذا الدين بالرجل الفاجر (صحيح البخاري, باب إن الله يؤيد الدين بالرجل الفاجر)\n\n[3] فقال قد حدث أمر عظيم قال فدخلت على حفصة فإذا هي تبكي فقلت طلقكن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قالت لا أدري ثم دخلت على النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فقلت وأنا قائم أطلقت نساءك قال لا فقلت الله أكبر\n(صحيح البخاري, باب التناوب في العلم)"
