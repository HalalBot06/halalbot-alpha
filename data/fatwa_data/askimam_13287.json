  "question": "what is the fatwa regarding selling television sets, dvd players and radios?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nwhat is the fatwa regarding selling television sets, dvd players and radios?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is an accepted and undeniable truth that televisions, dvd players and radios are multi-purpose appliances. However, an objective even handed assessment of their functions will reveal that televisions and dvd players are primarily used for Haram. Radios, on the other hand, are predominantly not used for Haraam.\n\nIn view of the above, the selling of radios will be permissible whilst the selling of television sets and dvd players are not permissible. (Ahsanul Fataawa vol.8 pg.287; Karachi)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
