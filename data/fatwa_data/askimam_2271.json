  "question": "What is the difference between Barailwis and Deobandis?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu alikum wa rahmatullah Mufti Sahab ! I wished that you explain to me what is the difference, if any, between the Barailwis and Deobandis? Also, could you please tell me whether you are Barailwi or Deobandi?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDarul Uloom Deoband (also other institutions based on Darul Uloom Deoband\nideologies) is sourced and referred to often. Inevitably, Deoband is based\non the teachings of the Noble Qur'an and Sunnah of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu\nAlayhi Wasallam) as well as the illustrious Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu √Ånhum)\n\nThe Barelwi / Deobandi issue is an age-old difference which should have been\nburied a long time ago, but unfortunately some people will resort to\nmud-slinging. May Allah Ta'ala guide all of us on the right path.\n1. You may refer to 'Mutalia Barelwi' by Dr. Allama Khalid Mahmood\n2. 'Who Are the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaa' by Mufti AH Elias\n3. 'Deoband Se Barelwi Tak' by Moulana Abu Awsaf\n4. 'Barelwi Fitna ka Naya Roup' by Muhammad Arif\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
