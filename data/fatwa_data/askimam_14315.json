  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI AM A NEW MUSLIM WOMEN AND I WEAR MY ABAYA AND HIJAB WHEN IN PUBLIC AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS IT THAT A WOMEN IS ALLOWED TO WEAR UNDER THIS ABAYA IF THE ABAYA IS  NOT  TRANSPARENT, ESPECIALLY FOR HOT SUMMER WEATHER,IS SHE ALLOWED TO WEAR WHAT EVER SHE WANTS?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIslam is a religion that has places everything in its correct perspective. A woman in the light of Islam is a preserved jewel. Generally, jewellery is always concealed from the public. It is preserved delicately in protective surrounds. Similar is a woman. Islam exorts her to be concealed from public view. She should not come out of her house.\n\nIf per necessary she has to emerge from her house, then too Islam has laid down principles of Hayaa and modesty. When a woman leaves her house, hs is prohibited from applying any make-up (perfume). (al-Targheeb vol.3 pg.84-85). She is required to dress in the most bashful attire, those garments that conceal her most. Even her shape/figure must not be visible. One could wear any garment that conforms to modesty in the eyes of a fairminded upring Muslim and does not imitate the dress of the disbelievers.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
