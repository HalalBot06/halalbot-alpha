I saw people fighting: they were shooting the scene for a movie. I was afraid. I kept running, crossing all these people (actors) pretending to fight. Someone saw me and thought I was lost. He said to one of his child who was with him: go and show the way to ibn Taymiyyah. What does that mean ???\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMay Allah Ta?ala always guide you from darkness to light.
