  "question": "If a husband and wife are exchanging their negative thoughts about, or experience with someone, would this be regarded as Gheebat? If so, how do they caution each other about someoneâ€™s habits?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the exchanging of thoughts or experiences are regarding a third person who will dislike this, it will be Gheebat.\n\nSuch discussions should be abstained from at all times. What happened in the past is gone and forgotten. This might also lead to endless problems later on, in the form of enmity, jealousy and hatred.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
