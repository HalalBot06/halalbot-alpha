  "question": "Is there any Islamic basis to a woman staying in the house for forty days after the birth of a child.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThere is a belief in our community that a woman must stay indoors, and in her home for forty days after she has given birth. Is this an Islamic practice? Does any harm come to the mother or the baby if they do venture outdoors during this \"forty day\" period? Are there any Islamic stipulations for the period after childbirth?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is no basis in Shari?ah for a woman to stay indoors specifically after giving birth.\n\nIf there is a need for to go outdoors for any reason acceptable in Shari?ah, she may do so on condition she adheres to the laws of Hijaab.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
