  "question": "Is it an option to follow Sunnah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPeople say that it is not obligatory to follow sunnah in each and every thing. They say Rasool Allah was different than human beings and could do many things that an ordinary human being can't do. They say that there were some qualities in Rasool Allah which were preoredained or predestined, like only his eyes used to sleep, not his heart. Humans can't have those qualites. And also, they say that Rasool Allah never asked us to have a beard, or to dress like him, eat like him etc. They say, now things are changed and we don't have to follow Rasool Allah in certain aspects. Is it an option to follow Sunnah? People say, there are many (modern) islamic scholors who wear a suit and dont have a beard. What are the things that Rasool Allah ordered us to do? Plz give some verses and hadiths. Thanx\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe concede that there were some qualities in Rasulullah (Salla Allahu alayhi wa salam) which were specific and special to him. But to deduce from this fact that we don't have to follow Rasulullah's (Salla Allahu alayhhi wa salam) way of life is totally out of context and absolutely incorrect. In fact, the pride of Islam is that is offers a system of life superior to all others. It is obligatory to follow the Sunnah of Rasulullah (SAlla Allahu alayhi wa salam) in all walks of life. The verses and Ahadith confirming this are too numerous to mention here. We will reproduce a few of them below:%0D%0A%0D%0A1) Allah Ta'ala says, \"Whatever the Messenger gives you, then grasp%0D%0Ait (implement it) and whatever he prohibits you then stay away from it. (Surah Hashr: Verse 7)%0D%0A%0D%0A2) Allah Ta'ala says, \"Say (Oh Muhammad (Salla Allahu alayhi wa%0D%0Asalam) if you love Allah follow me, then Allah will love you and forgive your sins. (Surah Ale Imran: Verse 31)%0D%0A%0D%0A3) Allah Ta'ala says, \"Indeed in the messenger of Allah is a%0D%0Abeautiful lifestyle for you, if you have hope for (meeting) Allah and for the last day.(Surah Ahzaab: Verse 21)%0D%0A%0D%0A4) Irbaadh ibn Saariyah (RA) reports, \"Raulullah (Salla ALlahu%0D%0Aalayhi wa salam) once advised us with such eloquence that our hearts trembled and our eyes flowed with tears. We said, \"O' Rasulullah, as though this is the advice of one bidding farewell therefore advise us. RASULULLAH (Salla Allahu alayhi wa salam) said, \"I advise you to fear Allah and to hear and obey even if a slave is made your leader. Whoever lives after me will indeed see many divisions, therefore follow my way and the way of the Khulafa-e-Raashideen (the rightly guided Khaleefas) cling to it with your teeth , and stay away from innovations for indeed every innovation is misguidance. (Riyadhus Saliheen: #157)%0D%0A%0D%0A5) Abu Hurairah (RA) reports that the Prophet (Salla Allahu alayhi%0D%0Awa salam) said, \"My entire ummah will enter jannah except he who refuses. The sahaba enquired, \"Who will refuse O' Rasulullah? Rasulullah (Salla Allahu alayhi wa salam) said, \"Whoever obeys me will enter jannah, and whoever disobeys me, he has refused.\"(Bukhari)%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the above it is apparent that it is obligatory to follow the sunnah of Rasulullah (Salla Allahu alayhi wa salam). The contention that Rasulullah (Salla Allahu alayhi wa salam) never asked us to keep a beard, or to dress like him, or eat like him is totally false. In regards to the beard, Nabi (Salla Allahu alayhi wa salam) has said, \"Oppose the mushrikeen, trim closely the moustache and grow the beard.\" (Muslim #500) Nabi (Salla Allahu alayhi wa salam) has also given us guidelines on how to dress. Ubaid ibn Khalid Al-Muhaarabi (RA) says, \" I was once walking in Madina when a person behind called out behind me, \"Raise your lower garment, for indeed it is closer to taqwa and more effective in protecting your clothes!\" The sahabi says, \"I turned around and that person was Rasulullah (Salla Allahu alayhi wa salam) then I said, \"O' Rasulallah, this is a malha cloth (low quality garment).\" Rasulullah (Salla Allahu alayhi wa salam) replied, \"Don't you find in me a beautiful example?\" I looked at Rasulullah (Salla Allahu alayhi wa%0D%0Asalam) and I found that his lower garment ended in the middle of his calves. (Shamaail Tirmidhi) Like this, Rasulullah (Salla Allahu alayhi wa salam) has given us directives and shown us by example how to lead our lives. Obviously to narrate all of them is beyond the scope of this answer. Books like Riyadhus Saliheen which have been translated into English will provide great insight into this. As for modern day scholars who wear suits and shave their beards, they are in no way a proof for substantiating the leaving out of the sunnah, rather they are a shame on Islam and a dishonour to the knowledge they have acquired.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AFOR-Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED and APPROVED: Moulana Emraan Vawda%0D%0A%0D%0A"
