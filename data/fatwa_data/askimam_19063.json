  "question": "Is it allowed for a Muslim woman to date a non-Muslim man?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have been Muslim for 1 year. I have a friend who was born and raised Muslim and practices Islam. She has been married before and has been looking for a new husband. She told me she cannot find a Muslim man. Today she is going to go out on a date with a non-Muslim. I was wondering if this was allowed as I am confused with this. Is it acceptable for a Muslim girl to go out on a date with a non-Muslim man? She told me he may convert to Islam so they can marry but that does not give me peace in my mind on what she is up to. Please help my lost and confused mind. I do not want to be misguided by the new ways of the world please help. \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nIt is not permissible for a Muslim woman to date or be in any unnecessary contact with a non-mehram male, whether Muslim or non-Muslim. This is strictly forbidden in Shari’ah. Allah Ta’ala has clearly mentioned in the Quran:\n\nقل للمؤمنين يغضوا من أبصارهم ويحفظوا فروجهم ذلك أزكى لهم إن الله خبير بما يصنعون   وقل للمؤمنات يغضضن من أبصارهن ويحفظن فروجهن ولا يبدين زينتهن إلا ما ظهر منها وليضربن بخمرهن على جيوبهن ولا يبدين زينتهن إلا لبعولتهن أو آبائهن أو آباء بعولتهن أو أبنائهن أو أبناء بعولتهن أو إخوانهن أو بني إخوانهن أو بني أخواتهن أو نسائهن أو ما ملكت أيمانهن أو التابعين غير أولي الإربة من الرجال أو الطفل الذين لم يظهروا على عورات النساء ولا يضربن بأرجلهن ليعلم ما يخفين من زينتهن وتوبوا إلى الله جميعا أيها المؤمنون لعلكم تفلحون\n\n\"Tell the believing men that they must lower their gazes and guard their private parts; it is more decent for them. Surely Allah is All-Aware of what they do. And tell the believing women that they must lower their gazes and guard their private parts, and must not expose their adornment, except that which appears thereof, and must wrap their bosoms with their shawls, and must not expose their adornment, except to their husbands or their fathers or the fathers of their husbands, or to their sons or the sons of their husbands, or to their brothers or the sons of their brothers or the sons of their sisters, or to their women, or to those owned by their right hands, or male attendants having no (sexual) urge, or to the children who are not yet conscious of the shames of women. And let them not stamp their feet in a way that the adornment they conceal is known. And repent to Allah O believers, all of you, so that you may achieve success\". (24:30-31)\n\nIt is necessary for her to immediately leave this man, cut off all contact, and make tawbah and istighfaar. If she is having trouble finding a Muslim man for marriage, she should seek the help of family and friends that can assist her in her search. She can even go to her masjid and inform the Imam that she is searching, and InshaAllah he may be able to assist her as well since an Imam has many ties within the Muslim community. As a friend, you should advise her to explore these avenues and at the same time make dua to Allah Ta’ala to bless her with a good, practicing Muslim husband.\n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\n \n\nMuftī Asif Umar\n\nWashington, DC (USA)\n\n \n\nConcurred by:\n\nMuftī Abrar Mirza\n\nChicago, IL (USA)\n\n \n\n\nUnder the Supervision of Muftī Ebrahim Desai (South Africa)\n\n \n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER – AskImam.org questions\nAskImam.org answers issues pertaining to Sharī’ah.
