  "question": "Is it permissible to play counter-strike?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs counter-strike 1.6 haram or halal? I play online, this is a famous game. I always play with a character that has a mask on his face so we can’t see the face but other players play with characters who don’t have a mask on the face and we can clearly see the face of the character. Is this shirk? Because characters are made by graphic designer. Is it a “kabira gunah” or “saghira gunah” to play this game? Please guide.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\nIt is not permissible to play the game counter-strike.
