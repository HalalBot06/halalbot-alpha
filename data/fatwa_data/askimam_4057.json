  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRAMADHAAN%0D%0AOne of the connotations of the multi-faceted word, 'Ramadhaan' is to%0D%0Aincinerate one's sins. This word is immortalized in the Noble Qur'an since%0D%0Ait is the only only month of the Islamic calendar referred to by its%0D%0Aspecific name. Almighty Allah proclaims, 'The month of Ramadhaan is that in%0D%0Awhich the Qur'an was revealed.' (Baqarah 85)%0D%0A%0D%0AAlmighty Allah says, 'O you who believe, fasting is prescribed upon you as%0D%0Ait was prescribed upon those before you, so that you may inculcate Allah%0D%0Aconsciousness.' (Baqarah 183). This verse brings to light two important%0D%0Afactors, firstly, that fasting is a vehicle through which a Muslim%0D%0Ainculcates the quality of Taqwaa (consciousness of Allah). fasting above all%0D%0Ais an act of obedience and submission of Allah. This submission and%0D%0Acommitment is upon the love of Allah and an earnest effort to gain His%0D%0Apleasure. Secondly, fasting has been used since time immemorial for this%0D%0Apurpose.%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, \"This month, the first part of%0D%0Awhich brings Allah's Mercy, the middle of which brings His forgiveness and%0D%0Athe last part of which brings emancipation from the fire.\" (ibn Khuzaymah).%0D%0AEvery creation of Allah is in need of His Mercy and as a result of this%0D%0Amercy one gains the forgiveness of Allah and it is through this forgiveness%0D%0Aone is liberated from the fire. Thus, we see in each segment of 10 days a%0D%0Aprogression of the spiritual development of the Muslim who fasts throughout%0D%0Athe month of Ramadhaan.%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Whoever stands in prayer%0D%0A(Taraweeh) during Ramadhaan, with complete faith and sincere hope of%0D%0Aobtaining reward, his previous sins are forgiven. The word, 'Taraweeh'%0D%0Aalludes to rest. The term applies to the period between every four Rakaats.%0D%0AThe word, 'I'tikaaf' refers to saying in the Musjid during the last ten days%0D%0Aof Ramadhaan. This seclusion demands an unreserved isolation from all%0D%0Amundane activities and one seeks attachment to the Creator. The principle%0D%0Aaim of I'tikaaf is to seek Laylatul Qadr. May Allah Ta'ala bestow His%0D%0Achoicest blessings on the Ummah and invoke amongst us the ability to obtain%0D%0Athe maximum benefit.%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Abdul-Qaadir Hoosen%0D%0A"
