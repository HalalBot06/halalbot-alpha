  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like to know what is the best way to separate brothers and sisters in our MSA and also if it is acceptable for sisters to be part of the shoora and make decisions with brothers. Jazak Allah Khair,\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two aspects in your query, a) Intermingling of sexes, b) Females\nparticipating in the Shura of an Association\n\nThe Qur'aan and Ahaadith of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) are\nreplete with orders of Hijaab between males and females. Therefore,\nintermingling of sexes is Haraam (strictly prohibited). Shari'ah does not\nprohibit females from making a contribution to the Association. She may\ncertainly do so without violating the express prohibition of Hijaab and\nintermingling of sexes.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
