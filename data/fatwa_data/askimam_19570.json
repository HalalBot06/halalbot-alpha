  "question": "I peeked into the bath my mom was showering in. How can I get forgiven?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhen I was around 16, out of sexual curiosity and teenage blindness I peeked into the bath my mom was showering in. It was intentional. Now it’s been years and I’m a much devoted Muslim and I take, respect and live with my mother. Can you tell me what to do to get rid of this guilty feeling which haunts me? My mother doesn’t know and according to her I’m her favorite child. Please help and be very open.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nThe Hadith of Nabi salallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam mentions, “Every son of Adam is a sinner and the best of sinners are those who repent.”[1]\n\nBrother this act that you had committed was indeed an evil and despicable one. But the fact that you are regretful for it is a sign of your Imān. If it was not for your belief in Allah Ta’ālā, accountability in the court of Allah Ta’ālā and the severity of the punishment of the hereafter you would have been totally complacent about this sin. But since you are conscious of Allah Ta’ālā and standing in front of him you have a great regret for this sin.\n\nWe are human and prone to sin. But sin should not be a barrier for us to progress in our life or Deen. If we ever happen to sin then we should immediately make Tawbah and make a firm resolution to not commit the sin again. Allah Ta’ālā is independent and has no need to punish us. There is nothing that Allah Ta’ālā could possibly gain from seeing us be punished. It is pointless to dwell on your past mistakes. Once you have made Tawbah then have strong hope and belief that Allah Ta’ālā has forgiven you, forget about your past wrong and move forward in trying to strengthen your link with Allah Ta’ālā.\n\nWe make Dua that Allah Ta’ālā guides you to righteousness and that which is most pleasing to him.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Ali bin Cassim\n\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nLos Angeles, CA (USA)\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Husain Kadodia.\nwww.daruliftaa.net\n\n\n\n\n[1]سنن ابن ماجه (2/ 1420)\n\nحَدَّثَنَا أَحْمَدُ بْنُ مَنِيعٍ قَالَ: حَدَّثَنَا زَيْدُ بْنُ الْحُبَابِ قَالَ: حَدَّثَنَا عَلِيُّ بْنُ مَسْعَدَةَ، عَنْ قَتَادَةَ، عَنْ أَنَسٍ، قَالَ: قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ: «كُلُّ بَنِي آدَمَ خَطَّاءٌ، وَخَيْرُ الْخَطَّائِينَ التَّوَّابُونَ»"
