  "question": "I wanted to know what happens in the afterlife to a man that is married to two women here on earth.Are they both still married to him in Ahiret? can he choose one and not the other?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\ni just wanted to know if it is possible to have only one wife after death despite the fact that you are married to 2 in this life or if you are obliged to still keep both women ...thank you for your healp and inshallah i will get a reply\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, a person will be married to whomsoever he was married to in\nthis world. However, Jannat is a place wherein each and every desire of a\nperson will be fulfilled and the true understanding of what is really going\nto happen is only known to One Being and that is Allah Ta'ala.\n\nWe should therefore concentrate our efforts in this world to earn that\nJannat and the favours Allah will grant a person, no eye has ever seen, no\near has ever heard and no mind has ever thought about it.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
