  "answer": "QUESTION\ncan i get married without any members of my family present. im female. age 22. need quick answer\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMarriage is a huge step in one?s life. Marriage could either make one?s life on earth a better one or could make it a misery. Therefore, the marriage partner one chooses should be one who will take care of you.\n\nSince your experience in life is limited, it is our opinion that you consult someone in your family and inform them of your intentions. If the marriage partner is suitable, then surely they will not hesitate to get you married. In fact, having them part of your marriage is a blessing. Nevertheless, it is not necessary for the family members to be present for the Nikah. If there are two witnesses and you have accepted the proposal of the boy, the Nikah is valid. You will be considered as his Shar?ee wife.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
