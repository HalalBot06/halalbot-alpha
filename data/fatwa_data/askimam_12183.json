  "question": "Please tell me where in Quran only that forbidden muslims female to marry male from the people of the book ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen the law revealed regarding polygamous marriage to four woman , the Holy Prophrt told those people to divorce who had more than four wives. My question is why this law apply to the Prophet's companions and people . Why didnt the Prophet divorce his wives which exceed more than four. This appear to look unfair. Please explain ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe are Muslims and completely follow the commands of Allah, whether it appeals to our defective intellects or not. Thus when Allah Ta'ala allowed Nabi (salallahu Alaihi wasallam) to keep more than 4 wives, who are we to object!%0D%0A%0D%0AThe verse 221 of Surah Baqarah shows that getting married to non-Muslims is not permissible for males and females, however verse 5 of Surah Ma'idah gave Muslim males permission to marry Christian and Jewish women, however permission wasn't given for Muslim women to marry Christians and Jews.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe wisdom in it being permissible for the Muslim male to marry a non-Muslim female is that he would be able to easily convince the Christian or Jewish wife into accepting Islam. There is a possibility of the non-Muslim male convincing his Muslim wife into abandoning Islam. Therefore, Islam has considered her feminine nature and protected her correct beliefs from being a victim of abuse from the male dominance.%0D%0A%0A%0D%0AThe Muslim husband is not obliged to pressurise his Christian%2FJewish wife to accept Islam. He may apply wisdom and diplomacy and only influence her to Islam. In Islam, a female is equally respected as a male, however, due to the different masculine and feminine natures, Islam believes in separation of roles.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is obvious that there are many things a male can do, which is not easily possible for a female and vice versa.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
