  "answer": "QUESTION\nShe is 100% pure english, no arabic or urdu....what is the time limit for her to learn arabic and to read the qu'ran and salah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is no time limit for a revert to Islam to learn to recite the Qur?aan and Salaat. She should try her level best to recite the Qur?aan, Salaat and other obligations of the Shari?ah as soon as possible. Not knowing to recite the Qur?aan should not be an obstacle to perform Salaat.\n\nYour friend may recite Subhaanallah, Alhamdulillah or Allaahu Akbar at least three times in every posture until she learns the basic Surahs to recite in Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
