  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam Allaikom, i wanna ask about worshipping Allah if someone has Tatoo, i know the prayer is considered invalid if someone has Tatoo,what if a non-muslim want to convert to Islam and he has Tatoo, how could he pray? should he remove the Tatoo?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTattooing is prohibited. However, this does not mean that one cannot or should not perform Salaat if he has tattoos on him. This makes clear that if a non-Muslim has tattoos on him, he can revert and perform Salaat. However, he should conceal the tattoos to the best of his ability.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
