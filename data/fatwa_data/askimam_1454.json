  "question": "A man has cheated during 2-4 classes out of the 35 classes needed to get a degree. Most of this was copying homework which he could try to do himself but did not. Is earning through degree haraam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThere was once cheating done during exams but that constitued the instructor helping the person. The same instructor was also helping other people during the exam. This person still feels that this was cheating and feels guilty. Should said person stop earning through this degree? Great difficulty will be suffered if he does so at this time. Later on, opening a business will be possible Insha-Allah. If this person opens a business later on, will that business money also be haraam since it was opened from the savings earned through above degree?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlthough cheating is prohibited but the earning through that degree will be\nhalaal.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti E Desai\nFatwa Dept."
