  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. Is it wrong for a person following the Imaam to recite sura faatiha and other suras during the silent rakaats? Is it better to recite the suras or not? 2. If a person joins salaat late, should a person get up to complete his missed rakaats after the first salaam of the Imaam, or after the second salaam? Is the salaat valid if a person does it the \"incorrect\" way?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\na) According to the Hanafi Madhab, it is prohibited for a Muqtadi (follower)\nto recite Surah Faatiha behind the Imaam in any Salaat.\nb) A Masbooq (person who missed one or more Rakaats should stand up for the\nmissed Rakats once he is certain that the Imaam has completed his Salaat and\nwill not make Sajda-e-Sahw after the first Salaam. That certainly is\ngenerally attained once the Imaam commences the second Salaam.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
