  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have never told this to any one except one of my friends. I remember coming home and I saw lots of sandals out side my house I am thinking who could be at my house. I saw about 10 people all wearing white cloths sitting on the floor in a circle talking, I don?t know what they where talking about and I also saw my father sitting in the circle talking. Out side the circle which is not that far away from them I saw my friend and I asked him who are these people he said the person who will drink from that glass is Rasulullah Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam and I waited to see who drinks from that glass and the person who was sitting right next to my father who had beard and was wearing a white Gotra (Arabic romal) took that glass which was different from the rest and the color of the water was different too. I didn?t see him drink the water. Then I remember me shaking that persons hand at the door and saying some sort of goodbye and I still didn?t see the face and then I saw that person wearing his sandals and leave. This was four years ago. My question. I did not know that after having a wet dream you must wash your self right away. After my wet dreams I go back to sleep with out cleaning usually I change but I didn?t, is the place where I slept and my sheets impure and if I sleep on them the next day will they make my clothes impure? Thank you for reading and answering my question. Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The dream of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is a blessed one.\nMay Allah Ta'ala grant us the ability to adhere to the Sunnah of Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n2. The sheets will become impure only if they get soiled with semen. In such\na situation, if the semen is dry, that will not make your clothes impure by\nsleeping on the sheets.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
