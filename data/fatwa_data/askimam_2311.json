  "question": "How should I treat the a marriage when the girl was my brothers girlfriend?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy parents are letting my brother marry his girlfriend (which is muslim) to save our family the shame of him continuing in a haram relationship with her. We were all very angry that he was doing this. However, my parents were unable to curve his behavior, and unwilling to tell him to leave the house if he didn't stop. I feel that I can never have any respect for the girl. During the times he was taking her out, I spoke to her and demanded she stop her actions ( I also told this to my brother). I don't plan on attending the wedding, is this wrong?. Islamicly how should i treat her knowing how she hooked my brother?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs much as you have advised them on this unislamic relationship. By getting\nmarried it will remove them from this and if a person makes sincere\ntauba(repents) and follows the shariah, I am sure that you would find it in\nyour heart to forgive and maintain the family relationship which Islam\nplaces emphasis on. As Nabi (salllallahu alyhi wasallam) said \"Whoever\nbreaks family ties, breaks his path to Jannah.\" So one needs to treat the\nsister-in-law as part of the family.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
