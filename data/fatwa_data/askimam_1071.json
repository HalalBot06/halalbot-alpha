  "question": "Maariya al-Qibtiyyah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu Alaikum I want clarification for the following In a publication from india I saw that Mariyam Quibthiya was not a wife of Prophet (saw) though she had a child from Prophet (saw). They tell she was a slave and became free on decease of Prophet (saw) They quoted qur'an verses on Captives (malakath Aimanukum)to explain their interpretation. My understanding is as below: Qur'an 4:25 instruct to accept captives only in Marriage. As per 24:32 for slaves ,they are to be given in marriage. As per Hadith also slaves are to be taken in marriage after educating and civilising them. Then Mariya (raliyallahu Anha) can only be prophet's wife. Could you please clarify. Wassalam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMaariya al-Qibtiyya was a slave female and was given as a gift to Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) by the Roman king. She bore the son of\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) who passed away during infancy.\n\nHowever, to regard Maariya al-Qibtiyyah as the sex slave of Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) as is presented by the west is a gross\nmisrepresentation of the noble personality of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam). Such statements are motivated by hatred and animosity.
