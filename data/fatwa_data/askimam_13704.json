  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissable for a girl to study an alima course via the internet&phone if her bro-in-law teaches her as she cannot leave home to study?\n\nMy brother-in-law(sister's husband) is a qualified alim & he is of good character. My sister cannot always be there when he is teaching me at night as they have small kids. The computer has a way of storing our message history so anyone can check what we communicated.(Only discuss what is necessary)\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nConsider the following:\n\nRasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Brother-in-law is death’. In principle, it is prohibited for a female to unnecessarily communicate with a Ghayr Mahram irrespective if the Ghayr Mahram is a permanent or not. This prohibition is more intense in the case of one’s brother-in-law. He is not just a Ghayr Mahram but also a member of the family through marriage. It thus becomes very easy for him to come into contact with his sister-in-law. This is not so in the case of other Ghayr Mahrams.\n\nThe Qur’aan and Ahaadith are replete with warnings of the tricks of the Shaytaan and evil inclinations of our Nafs. Allah states, ‘Shaytaan is your avowed enemy.’ Allah also says, ‘Verily the Nafs intensely orders evil.’ There is a great possibility that Shaytaan will play its tricks on both of them who also have their Nafs with them and cause the flow of evil thoughts running in their minds. There is no deterrent from that. It is natural as it is a matter of a male and female. To become an Aalima is virtuous but not Fardh. To guard oneself against the Shaytaan and Nafs is Fardh. Therefore, we advise against this programme.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
