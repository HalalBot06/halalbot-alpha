  "question": "Should we do Rafa Yadain?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI want to ask what is right, should we do rafa῾yadain or not?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum  wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nAccording to the Hanafi Mazhab (school of thought), it is preferable not to do Rafa῾yadain (raising the hands) in other postures except for takbēr- e- tahrīmah. However, if one does so, then it is permissible. \n\nThe other Mazhabs’ Shafī῾,Maliki and Hanbali prefers doing Rafa῾yadin in other postures as well as during takbēr- e- tahrīmah.\n\nThe founders of each of the four Mazhab were authorities in all aspects of Deen. Every ruling is well substantiated with Qurān, Hadith and the different sciences.   \n\nEvery person who adheres to a Mazhab should follow the ruling of his Mazhab. No person following his Mazhab should be reproached.  \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Zaid Mohammed Shelia,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\nUSA\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
