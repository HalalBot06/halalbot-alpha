  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a 24 year old male studying my final year(insha-Allah)at university. I am the only son and was sent away to study at the age of 13. My eldest sister, who has been helping my father in bussiness, is getting married the end of the year insha-Allah. I have been studying architecture and employment is only realy feasible in large cities. My parents live in a small town in the North-west province and there are no employment opportunities in my field there. My father is runing 2 bussinesses and also farms cattle. He has a cholestroll problem and i'm afraid of what might happen when my sister leaves, because he is not likely to sell a business. Is it my duty to now return home and help my father in his bussinesses? This will mean that my time spent studdying was a waste, but i need to know what the right thing to do is.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour concern for your father is commendable. Your father is best aware of his condition and your situation. He is the senior of the family. You should discuss your concern with him as it also involves him and his situation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
