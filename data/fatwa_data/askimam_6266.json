  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn marrying a Christian lady, since her parents have been planning her marriage for quite some time now and i don't want to ruin it for her, am i allowed to have 2 different ceremonies of marriage, one for Islam, and one for Christianity??? my next question is why are you not allowed to have any type of contact with your fiance?if you are not allowed to have contact with anyone from the opposite sex how are you even supposed to get to know the other person in order to even get engaged??? third question is, since as a Muslim we're are not allowed to have so much verbal contact with any females, how are we supposed to get to know them and find the right one for our selves???..because if this is not allowed, i think it would lead into arranged marriage where your parents pick your bride for you without your will. if these questions are open endidly answered i would appreciate it i have read alot of answers on this board, and i am looking for some new information rather than same answers that i've read before, since the other answers didn't really answer my questions..thank you very much.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said \"Whosoever adds to the (i.e. adds%0D%0Ato their number by taking part) gathering of a certain people (joins them in%0D%0Asin if they are Muslims or takes part in their ceremony or cusstom if they%0D%0Aare non-Muslim), he will be reckoned among them.\" This Hadith and numerous%0D%0Aothers like it directly forbid sharing in the practices%2F ceremonies of%0D%0Anon-Muslims. Therefore, it is not permissible to be present in a christian%0D%0Amarriage ceremony, not even as an observer. See also (Marriage to%0D%0AAhle-Kitaab women-attached)%0D%0A2. Parents marrying of their children against their will is a practice of%0D%0AJaahiliyyah (Period of ignorance) not sanctioned by Islam. There is a whole%0D%0Achapter of Ahadith instructing the Waliyy (Guardians) to seek permission%0D%0Afrom their charges before marrying them off. Similarly, there are many%0D%0AAhadith describing the qualities one should seek in a spouse. This would not%0D%0Abe possible if one did not have a choice in the matter. At the same time%0D%0Ahowever, Islam has prohibited free intermingling of sexes due to the%0D%0Aundeniable Fitnah (mischief) arising thereof. Therefore free contact between%0D%0AGhair Mahaarim without necessity is forbidden. Marriage, however is a real%0D%0Anecessity and has been recognised as such by Islam, in as much as a slight%0D%0Arelaxation of the prohibition. A prospective spouse has been allowed to see%0D%0Awithout Hijaab, those parts of the body which are not Awrah for her%2F his%0D%0Amahram relatives. Due to everpresent Fitnah, even now free contact is not%0D%0Aallowed. This does not mean that a person is unable to find out about the%0D%0Acharacter etc of the intended spouse. He %2Fshe will definitely have Mahram%0D%0Arelatives of the same sex that they could communicate through, should the%0D%0Aneed arise. This system has worked well enough for fourteen centuries of%0D%0AIslam and continues to work more efficiently than the Kufr system of free%0D%0Acontact. This is evident from the great disparaty in the divoce rate between%0D%0Ae.g. America and Saudi Arabia. The high divorce rate in western countries%0D%0Aspeaks for itself. Despite intimate aquaintance before marriage, why, then%0D%0Ais divorce rate still soaring?%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Bilaal Cassim%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
