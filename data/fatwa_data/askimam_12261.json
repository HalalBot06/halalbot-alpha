  "question": "Why is it necessary to repay money that was stolen from before you were muslim ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have just found this out after being muslim for two years and now I am quite stressed out about it because i have plans to go to a madrasa soon . I am not sure how to pay this back because it happened a very long time ago , I dont have the money to pay any of the people back . Can I write a letter to them asking if they will free me of my debt to them ? Is there a dua to say that will free you of your debt?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari?ah, the wealth and possession of every individual, Muslim or non-Muslim, is sacred.\n\nIf you stole money from people before accepting Islam, it is still compulsory to repay the money to them. You may write to them and request them to forgive you. If they forgive you, you will be absolved of that right. May Allah Ta?ala keep you firm and steadfast on Deen and Imaan, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
