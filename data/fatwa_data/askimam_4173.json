  "question": "Can a person sign a contract in order to sell themself to be a slave?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs Salaamu 'Alaykum wa Rahmatallahi wa Barakatuhu, May this letter find you while you are in the highest state of Iman. Amin. Sir, you were referred to me a person who can either give, or has excellent sources for fatwas. I am an African American Sunni \"revert\" muslim, who Fears Allah. Alhamdulillah, I have been muslim for almost 10 years now; I am 31 years old. I a writing to you to gain clarity on an issue; maybe you can assist, Insha' Allah. I have been told by several muslims that it is possible for someone to \"sell\" themselves into slavery, even if it is for a short period of time (say 3-4 years.) I was told that this could be so that their \"master/owner\" would pay off their debts, shelter them, feed them, and then they would have the opportunity to do whatever was part of their contract (i.e. cook/build a house, or whatever services were agreed to) in order to be freed. Is this claim legitimate? Why or why not? Is it permissable now? Additionally, could a slave in this respect be treated in the same way as those who were caught/sold due to Jihad? In other words, could their male muslim owners have sex with them too? I appreciate any and all advise that you could give me in this area. Shukron Jazillan. Sincerely, Abu Bakr\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not possible for a person to voluntarily become a slave. A legitimate\nslave is he who is taken captive as a prisoner of war by a muslim army.\nHence, the information given to you to sell yourself as a slave is\nincorrect. If a person has a debt he should seek an employment and pay the\ndebt from his income.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
