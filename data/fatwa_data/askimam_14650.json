  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs-Salaam-u-Alaikum,\n\nI was retrenched from my employer and decided to invest my pension monies in a preservation fund in order to defer payment of tax. This money is readily available to me, if I withdraw all or part of it I will have to pay income tax. My question is , do I have to pay Zakaat on the amount in the fund after deducting the average rate of tax each year, or do I only pay zakaat once after withdrawing the money and deducting the average tax payable?\n\nJazakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nZakat will be payable every year.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
