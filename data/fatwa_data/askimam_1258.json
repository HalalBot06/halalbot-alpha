  "question": "is it permissable to hug each other on the days of Eid?what was the Prophets practice on celebrating Eid Please give references from Quran and authentic hadith",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo shake hands and hug one another on happy occasions is Mubaah (permissible). The general principle of a Mubaah act is not to regard the act as compulsory as that projects a wrong image of Deen. Furthermore, people should not regard the meeting on the day of Eid as compulsory and an inseparable part of the occasion.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
