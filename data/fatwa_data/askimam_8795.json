  "question": "1. I have read that I need to feed 10 people for breaking a promise...Is it permissible for me to send this money to my relatives in a muslim country who will share it among ten poor people",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have read that I need to feed 10 people for breaking a promise not to do something. Is it permissible for me to send this money to my relatives in a muslim country who will share it among ten poor people, or do I need to buy the food and give it to them. Also, in the past I didn't know that to sacrifice an animal during Eid ul idha is fard for those owning the value of nisaab. My father would do it but for himself only. He said that he would give it on behalf of the whole family, but it was only one sacrifice, not animal such as a buffalo that can be shared between 7 people. Does this mean I still need to pay for all the ones I missed? Is it valid to give this money to poor muslims or mujahideen? Is it permissible to use a pot whose handle and lid are slightly gold plated?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. When feeding, a person has a choice of, a) Feeding 10 poor people, b) Give them the food or, b) Give them the value of the food. (Ma?ariful Qur?aan vol.3 pg.224)\n\n2. If you had owned the value of Nisaab on the days of Qurbaani, then Qurbaani was Waajib on you. If you did not do Qurbaani during the days of Qurbaani, then it is Waajib to give the value of an animal on the day as you are discharging it as Sadaqah. (Ahsanul Fataawa vol.7 pg.480). This money may be given to poor Muslims and Mujaahideen.\n\n3. It is permissible to use gold plated utensils. However, it is preferable not to use such utensils. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyah vol.12 pg.326)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
