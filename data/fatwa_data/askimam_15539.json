  "question": "Could I try to get my sister to talk to a girl that I have seen for an engagement?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCould I try to get my sister to talk to a girl that I have seen for an engagement or will I have to go through my parents? Or will I have to do it myself?\n\nI am a 20 year old male. Recently my sister got married and moved to her husband’s house. During the wedding I saw a girl whom I was attracted to. She is a few years younger than me. Everytime I saw her at one of the wedding events, I had to get myself out of the room as I couldn't bear to look at her (I was very nervous and shy) I'm not normally like this and this has never happened to me before. She is the cousin of my new brother-in-law. And now she is on my mind. I think I am in love! I hope she feels the same way.\n\nCould I try to get my sister to talk to a girl that I have seen for an engagement? Or am I to mention this to my parents about a possible engagement for the near future. I am scared that someone else may get her first. Or is all of what I am doing haraam? Please answer this question. I'm getting paranoid. And are there any duah’s I can read to help me in this situation.\n\n JK\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nYou should discuss the issue with your parents and guardians and seek their guidance.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa, Madrassah In'aamiyyah"
