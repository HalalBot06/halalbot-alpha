  "question": "Ref to 4872 and 4220. What should the girl do in this situation?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat should the girl do in this situation ref 4220? If she has to choose between parents and the person she has committed adultery with. What should the girl do? Should she obey her parents and deceive her future husband who then, upon realizing that she is not a virgin makes her life miserable, and she has to suffer for the rest of her life? Even though the blessings of parents are present but the life of the girl is ruined. Or should the girl dis-obey /dis-please her parents and marry the person she has committed adultery with? The husband will not make her life miserable on her not being a virgin in this scenario. But in this scenario the blessings of her parents will not be there, but her life will not be that miserable. Allah is aware of what we do even though we try to hide things from people, shouldn?t we do what is best in the eyes of Allah or should we do things to please people who are not effected by our actions?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn this case, it is left to the discretion of the girl. She is after all,\nallowed to marry whom she chooses.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
