  "question": "Khidr's death: What is the Muhadditheen's evidence for saying Khidhr is dead?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHafiz ibnus Salaah (RA) - a great Muhaddith himself - states, 'He, Khidr%0D%0A(Alayhis salaam), is alive according to the majority of the Ulama and%0D%0Anon-Ulama as well. There are only but a few of the Muhadditheen that refute%0D%0Ahis existence.' Imam Nawawiy (RA) has also mentioned similar to this.%0D%0A(Fataawa ibnus Salaah vol.1 pg.185; Fathul Baari vol.6 pg.527)%0D%0A%0D%0AThose who claim that Khidr (Alayhis salaam) no longer exists use the%0D%0Afollowing as their proof in argument.%0D%0A1. The Aayat of the noble Qur'aan, 'And we have not granted any human%0D%0Aimmortality.' (Ambiyaa 34). Those who believe in Khidhr's (Alayhis salaam)%0D%0Aexistence would reply to this argument that, the existence of Khidhr%0D%0A(Alayhis salaam) till this day does not necessitate him being immortal.%0D%0A2. The Hadith of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) recorded by Imaam%0D%0ABukhari (RA) and others that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said,%0D%0A'None shall remain on the face of the earth from among those that are%0D%0Apresent on the earth today - after a hundred years.' Those that believe in%0D%0Ahis existence answer this by mentioning the position of Khidhr (Alayhis%0D%0Asalaam) being on the sea at that time at Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) mentioned this regarding the people of the land and not the sea.%0D%0A3. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) in his Du'aa on the night of the%0D%0Abattle of Badr mentioned, 'Oh Allah, if you destroy this group of my%0D%0Acompanions then there shall remain nobody on the face of the earth who will%0D%0Aworship you.' However, the same reply as the previous can be given.%0D%0AAnd over and above that, it could be said that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) did not intend the literal meaning, for the fact that there%0D%0Awere some companions that were not present on that battlefield due to some%0D%0Areason, not forgetting the women and children who would have also kept%0D%0Aworshipping Allah Ta'ala even after the death of these who took part in%0D%0ABadr.%0D%0A%0D%0AFurthermore, though there may be no solid Shar'ee proof for establishing his%0D%0Aexistence, reality and time bears witness to it. Imam Nawawiy (RA)( states,%0D%0A'The amount of incidents and occurrences regarding him as well as the%0D%0Aexperiences of the pious with him are innumerable.' (Fathul Bari vol.6%0D%0Apg.528)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
