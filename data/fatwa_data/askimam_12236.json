  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour question is unclear.\n\nIt appears that you always feel that your Wudhu is breaking. If our understanding is correct, then our advice to you is, if you feel your Wudhu is breaking and there is no reason in Shari?ah for your Wudhu to be broken, then your Wudhu will be intact and valid. You should ignore such baseless thoughts as that is from the Shaytaan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
