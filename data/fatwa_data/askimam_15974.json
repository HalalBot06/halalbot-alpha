  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy question is with regards to a dua for protection:\nIt is reported from Hadrat Muhallab Bin Abi Safoora (RA) that in a certain Jihaad in order to be safe guarded fro, being attacked by the enemy in the night, Rasoolullah (peace & blessings of Allah be upon him & his family) was heard saying:\n \n\"HA MEEM LA YUN SAROON\"\n \nWhen saying the word HA MEEM one should make the dua that the enemy fails hopelessly.\nIn view of the above dua, whenever one finds oneself in a dangerous situation where one is about to be attacked with any weapon, one should immediately recite the above dua. By the will of Allah, the enemy will fall hopelessly in his evil attempt.\nPlease can you verufy how authentic this is & its strength - is it a sahih, hasana, mudhaaf or hadith maudu'a?\n \nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe narration mentioned in the query is related as follows:\n\nعن المهلب بن أبى صفرة قال أخبرنى من سمع النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول « إن بيتم فليكن شعاركم حم لا ينصرون ».\n\nIt has been narrated in Sunan Abi Dawood on the authority of Muhallab bin Abi Safrah (Rahimahullah) that he narrates from those who have heard from Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) that Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) said, “When you are being attacked at night, your slogan should be ‘Hameem La Yunsaroon’.\n\nIt has been explained in Ta’leequl Mahmood, on the marginal notes of Sunan Abi Dawood, that by reading these words, one takes a vow upon Alah Ta’ala that the enemy will not be assisted. It is as if though one is trying to attain the help of allah Ta’ala.\n\nSunan Abi Dawood Vol.1 Pg.349 (H.M. Sa’eed Company)\n\nThis phrase was used as a slogan amongst the Muslims. When they were attacked at night, they would utter this phrase so that the other Muslims are informed that they are being attacked.\n\nThis phrase also served as a secret code to identify with fellow Muslims. A non-Muslim may claim to be a Muslim for various reasons. If he does not forward the secret code, it will be clear that he is not a Muslim. As it has been explained on the marginal notes of Jami’ Al Tirmizi that the word شعار (shi’aar) refers to a code through which one can identify his fellow companions.\n\nJami’ Al Tirmizi Vol.1 Pg.297 (H.M. Sa’eed Company)\n\nImam Abu Dawood did not comment on this narration, which means that this is not from those narrations that are dha’eef (weak) or maudhoo’ (fabricated).\n\nMoreover, it has been considered in Mustadrak Al Hakim as saheeh (authentic).\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
