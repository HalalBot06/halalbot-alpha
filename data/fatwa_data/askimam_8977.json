  "question": "1.What is the correct way of cleaning oneself after urinating(istinjah)? 2.Can we use tissue paper or sand stone in place of water to clean ourselves after urinating",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have heard that our prophet used to carry a stone(sand) when coming out of the toilet because often one gets the feeling that a drop is going to come out when a person starts walking. To prevent his clothes form getting in touch with the drop our prophet used to clean the drop with this stone(sand). Is this true. Please clarify. 2.Can we use tissue paper or sand stone in place of water to clean ourselves after urinating even if water is sufficently available?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDuring the time of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), water was not easily available. Sand and stone were used in place of water for Istinjaa.\n\nTo use water is the ideal option. Allah Ta?ala praises the people of Qubaa as those who love to purify themselves due to them using water during Istinjaa. If one uses sand, stone or tissue inspite of water being available, it will be in order if the impurity is removed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
