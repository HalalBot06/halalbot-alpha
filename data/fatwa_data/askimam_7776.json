  "question": "My father passed away 19 years ago. He had a will but my mother refuses to allow me to see it. She says he left everything to her. What do I do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy mother is a professional person. My father passed away when I was 5 years old. He was a professional as well. During this time he saved money in london as well as in properties. My mother says that he left it all to her and thats that. Now I am married and I think I also deserve what is mine, nothing more nothing less. Yet I dont want to destroy my family because of money. I know in my heart that my father left his money to islamic distribution. What do I do because I am at a loss?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, we wish to advise you that this is a sensitive issue as it deals with close family relations. Therefore, we suggest you implore wisdom and tact to resolve the estate amicably.\n\nNevertheless, explain to your mother the benefits of dissolving an estate, the negative implications to deceased, etc. We suggest you contact an Aalim who may intervene and amicably resolve the issue efficiently.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
