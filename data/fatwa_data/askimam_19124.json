  "question": "Is it permissible to desex an animal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI just want to ask: Is it permissible to desex an animal if you want to keep him/her as a pet, not for breeding purpose?\n\nAs I want to keep a rabbit either a pair of male and female or two males or two females, I was reading that if you are not planning to breed from your pet, desexing is recommended. It ensures a calm temperament and reduces the likelihood of some serious diseases. Desexing reduces the incidence of uterine cancer and also reduces aggression on both sexes. Female rabbits should be desexed to prevent development of uterine cancer as there is a high chance of female rabbits contracting the cancer if they are not bred from. If you want to have more than one rabbit, then you will need to desex your rabbits. Male rabbit may become obsessive about marking his territory (spraying his semen/urine about and very much dirtying his surroundings).\n\nAlso I want to spay him/her because of purity point of you. I don't want them to spray urine on the wall and floors where we pray. Please answer me in the light of Quran. I know Islam does not allow harming any animal. But I just want to do it for their health and for purification point of you. Sorry for such a long question.\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nIn principle, if desexing an animal will bring any benefit or will prevent some harm, it will be permissible to desex the animal. On the other hand, if desexing the animal will not bring any benefit or prevent some harm, it will not be permissible to desex the animal. Desexing the animal with the intention of fattening it or allowing its meat to become tastier or preventing it from breeding or preventing it from aggressive behaviour are examples of valid reasons for desexing an animal.\n\nTherefore, if desexing rabbits does have the benefits that you mentioned, it will be permissible for you to desex them.\n\n \n\nفي الدر المختار: وجاز خصاء البهائم حتى الهرة ... وقيدوه بالمنفعة وإلا فحرام ؛ وقال في الشامية: ( قوله وقيدوه ) أي جواز خصاء البهائم بالمنفعة ، وهي إرادة سمنها أو منعها عن العض ( رد المحتار: 9/640 ، دار المعرفة )\n\n \n\nوقال الطحطاوي: ( قوله: وقيدوه بالمنفعة ) ... وعللوا جواز الخصاء بأن فيه تطييبا للحم وترك النكاح والنزو ( حاشية الطحطاوي على الدر المختار:4/195 )\n\n \n\nفي الفتاوى الهندية: وأما في غيره (أي: وأما الخصاء في غير الفرس) من البهائم فلا بأس به إذا كان فيه منفعة ، وإذا لم يكن فيه منفعة أو دفع ضرر فهو حرام كذا في الذخيرة (الفتاوى الهندية: 5/437 ، العلمية )\n\n \n\nفي الخانية: ولا بأس بخصاء السنور إذا كان فيه ضرر، ولا بأس بخصاء البهائم وكي الأغنام لأن فيه منفعة ظاهرة ( فتاوى قاضيخان: 3/312 ، العلمية )\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMl.
