  "question": "is it alright if i don't show any of the co-worker that i am not praying during my periods",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI work in an office where there are many male co-workers. Due to the office timings I have to perform at least three prayers in the office. But during my menstruation period I only go to the prayer room and recite some duaas and surahs (orally) as I want to spend some time praying to Allah either in the form of Namaz or in the form of recitation (when I cannot perform Namaz). Another reason is that I don?t want anyone (especially any male worker) to ask why am I not praying today as I don?t feel easy answering this question. Tell me if what I am doing is right or wrong because when I go to the prayer room everyone knows I am praying but sometimes (during periods) I am not actually performing namaz I am only reciting.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is in fact advisable for a female during menses to engage in the Dhikr of Allah Ta?ala during Salaat times. Your conduct is therefore appropriate.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
