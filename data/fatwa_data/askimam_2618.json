  "question": "Is the Divorce Valid? Kindly explain in detail what is Khula.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nA person performed 2nd marriage without the knowledge of his first wife. When 1st wife found about his marriage, she asked her husband to divorce her. Upon her husband's refusal, she contacted the Judiciary System (supreme court) to help her with this. Supreme court issued notice to her husband to appear in court several times but husband didn't show up. Finally, the court ruled that they were divorced on the basis of Khula. The question that I want to ask is if this divorce is valid because husband didn't want to divorce her 1st wife and he didn't sign any documents which would validate this divorce? Please advise.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nespected Brother-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0AQ: Kindly explain in detail what is Khul'a. Will the Khul'a be valid if the%0D%0Ahusband does not agree?%0D%0AA: Khul'a is defined as follows: 'his (husband's) acceptance of wealth in%0D%0Aexchange of his possession (of the woman's hand) in the marriage. (Fathul%0D%0AQadir vol.6 pg.57; Rashidiyya).%0D%0A%0D%0AThe following verse forms the basis of Khul'a: 'If you fear that they (the%0D%0Aspouses) may not uphold the boundaries of Allah, then there is no harm upon%0D%0Athe two of them (spouses) in the ransom offered by her (wife).' (1:229)%0D%0A%0D%0AIbn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that the wife of Thabit ibn Qais%0D%0A(RA) came to Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and said, 'Regarding Thabit%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhu), I do not fault his character nor his Deen (religion),%0D%0Abut I fear being ungrateful in Islam. I want to return his garden to him (in%0D%0Aexchange of Talaaq).' Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) asked, 'Do you%0D%0Areally want to do this?' she replied, 'Yes'. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) said (to her husband), 'She wishes to return your garden to you%0D%0A(in exchange for Talaaq). He asked, 'Do I have the right to (accept it)?'%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) replied, 'Yes'. He said, 'Then I accept%0D%0A(the garden in exchange of the Talaaq). (Musannaf Abdul-Razzaak vol.5%0D%0Apg.391; HM Saeed)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above can be further understood by the following: 1. Allaamah Kaasaani%0D%0A(RA) states 'contracting for Talaaq by means of an exchange.'%0D%0A(Badaai-us-Sanaaie; Ahsanul Fataawa vol.5 pg.382). 2. Imaam Zaylaa'ee (RA)%0D%0Astates, 'None of them have the right to compel their partner against their%0D%0Awill.' (Tibyaanul Haqaaiq; Ahsanul Fataawa vol.5 pg.382; HM Saeed) 3.%0D%0AShamsul Aimmah Sarakhsi (RA) stated, 'Khul'a is permissible in the presence%0D%0Aof the Sultan, i.e. presiding authority, or anyone else, because it is a%0D%0Acontract based on mutual agreement like all other contracts.' (Mabsoot;%0D%0AAhsanul Fataawa vol.5 pg.385; HM Saeed)%0D%0A%0D%0A%3EFrom the above quotations of the noble Qur'aan, Ahaadith and Fiqh%0D%0A(jurisprudence), it is clear that Khul'a is a contract by mutual consent%0D%0Abetween the husband and wife. The wife cannot unilaterally institute Khul'a%0D%0Awithout the consent %2F agreement of the husband. However, if the husband is%0D%0Aspiteful and withholds the divorce, the wife may contact a reliable Judicial%0D%0Acommittee to annul the marriage. If there are valid grounds, the annulment%0D%0Awill be considered.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
