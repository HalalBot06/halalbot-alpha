  "question": "Since we are seeing each other, can we perform a secret marriage to avoid committing adultery and officially marry next year?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am proposed to a girl. Our families want us to marry only next year.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised, ?Announce the Nikah.? (Mishkaat pg.272; Qadeemi)\nThe wisdom behind the announcement is to avoid any misconception of an illegal and illicit relationship between the boy and girl. Although the first and secret marriage for the purpose of legalizing intimacy will be valid, but we are also advised to abstain from doubt and disgrace. If the Nikah is not announced, people witnessing the relationship will regard the relationship as Haraam and illegal.\n\nFurthermore, what if the girl conceives and gives birth before the official ?second? marriage? The negative factors surrounding that as well as the child for the rest of his/her life are well known. Therefore, we advise that if there is a dire need to fulfil one?s desires, the Nikah be expedited to avoid the abovementioned negative factors of a secret marriage.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
