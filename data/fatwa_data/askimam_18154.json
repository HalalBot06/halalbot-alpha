  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI want to know whether my khula is valid. This is how it happened:\n\nI was married for three years and my mother-in-law, father-in-law and brother-in-law abused me mentally. My husband mostly got angry at me as he believed them very easily. One day he told his parents that I had made life hell for him, which was not true. Since then, they were just waiting to harass me. Three years of marriage were about to complete and I was expecting my first baby. My husband decided to move with his parents to create a good relationship between me and his parents. But his parents took this as another opportunity to mentally harass me (again, my husband did not understand this and did not consider my fears and concerns legitimate). My father had passed away a year ago and none of my uncles were ready to get involved in this. One of my neighbours helped me get khula through police intervention. My husband and his mother were detained in police station and my husband signed on the papers. Then his mother was allowed to go home. Was this khula valid?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIn order for us to respond, kindly forward us the contents of the letter your husband signed.\n\n\nÂ \n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\n\nDarul Iftaa"
