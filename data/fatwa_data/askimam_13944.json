  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni want to ask something about \"hisaab kitaab\" on the day of Qayamah. somebody posted a Hadees on a discussion forum about the people who will enter into the Jannah without \"hisaab kitaab\". i have also heared many times from Ulma that there will be some people who will go into the Jannah without hisaab kitaab. another member on that discussion forum said that there are several ayaat in Quran Pak about hisaab kitaab which said that there MUST be the hisaab kitaab of everyone. for reference see (4/86), (21/47), (1/21). He said that Ahadees on this issue are not true as Allah clearly said in Quran that there must be hisaab kitaab of everyone, and he said that Ahadees which seems to be in conflict with Qurani ayaat should be rejected. please guide me on this issue.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are Sahih Ahaadith regarding Hisaab kitaab (accountability). Abu Hurayra [radhiallaahu anhu] narrates that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Seventy thousand people will enter into Jannah without reckoning.’ A man then asked, ‘O messenger of Allah, ask Allah to make me from amongst them.’ Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] supplicated, ‘O Allah, make him from among them.’ (Muslim Hadith519)\n\nIn Bukhari, there is a similar Hadith (Hadith5811)\n\nWith regard to the Qur’aan, Aayat86 of Surah 4, ‘When a greeting is offered to you, meet it with a greeting still more courteous or of equal courtesy. Allah takes careful account of all things.’ This refers to all matters which be taken account of. Even with regard to a simple matter where a person greets with salaam and the answer of the salaam will be taken into account. Every good deed or bad deed however insignificant it might seem will be taken into account.\n\nIn the question, reference has been given as 1/21. This is incorrect. The verses referred to is 21/1, ‘Closer and closer to mankind comes their reckoning, yet they heed not and turn away.’\n\nThe above verse is with regard to the closeness of the day of Qiyaamat. That since we are the last ummah, that no other ummah will come after the Ummah of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. Verse 21/47, ‘We shall set up scales of justice for the day of judgment, so that not a son will be dealt with unjustly in the least. If there be (no more than) the weight of a mustard seed we will bring it (to account). We are sufficient to take account (Hisaab)\n\nThis verse refer to the type of courts that Allah will convene, it will be a court of justice where no oppression will take place. Where every deed good or bad, big or small, will be reckoned for. Almighty’s court will be full of justice. These verses do not negate people entering into Jannah without reckoning. There are authentic Ahaadith addressing the issue of people entering Jannah without reckoning.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
