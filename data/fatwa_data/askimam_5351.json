  "question": "A custom in our family about marriage. how can we convince our parents?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-O-Alaikum Warakhmatullah. (1) My mother wants to marry me with my uncle?s daughter and my uncle (brother of my father) too wants to marry his daughter with me due to a custom in our family i.e. if there is an uncle?s son/daughter you must marry with him/her. But I do not want to marry with my uncle?s daughter and also my uncle?s daughter does not want to marry me. So how can we convince our parents? (2) Is mouth freshener used to spray inside the mouth to create fragrance in the mouth is legal (valid)? Jazak Allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari'ah, an adult male and female has an independent right\nto choose his/her marriage partner. An adult is not bound to follow the\nfamily custom. He/she may do so if he/she wish to.\n\nIt is not proper for the elders of the family to compel one to go against\nhis/her wishes within the Shari'ah. We also advise that Nikah is a major\nstep in one's life and it is important to make Istikhaara as well as seek\nthe guidance and experience of one's seniors.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
