  "question": "Can I show affection for my wife in public?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan I show affection for my wife in public?\n\nI am an american muslim. I got married 9 moths ago and me and my muslim wife often go out to social places like the mall and movies. My wife wears a hijab and respectable clothing where the pants go all the way down to her ancles and her pants cover her butt completely. I wanted to know if I could hold her hips or put my hand around her shoulder at the mall. I don't do anything to make us stand out or embarrass either of us. I feel that this is just a regular thing that guys do to show that they love their partners please advise\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nRasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘There are more than 70 branches of religion. The most important is to proclaim Laa ilaaha illallaah and the least is to remove a harmful object from the road. And shame is a great and important branch of Imaan.’ (Bukhari)\n\nIt is very pleasing to note that your wife wears the Hijaab and Islamic attire. May Allah keep her steadfast, Aameen. Islam is a religion of shame and modesty. We have our own value system. What is normal in people is not always in comformity with Islamic principles and values. There surely is no love like the love between the husband and wife. The husband and wife should also express their love for one another. However, that is a private matter between the two and not for public show. Why do we have to show or prove to people our love for our marriage partners. What will the partner achieve through their show? In fact, it would be hypocrisy to abuse the wife in the confines of the house and still express love for her in public places. Love between the husband and wife must be a real and honest one only for themselves and not for public show.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
