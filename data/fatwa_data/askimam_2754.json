  "question": "Does qadah salah make up for the obligatory salah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome people say that qadah salah does not really make up for obligatory salah, but you still have to do it? Is this true and to what extent? If qadah does not make up for missed salah, then what is the purpose of qadah? If you make up for all missed salah through qada, will you be saved for making up the salah on the day of judgement e.g. there will be no need to make up for missed salah through your nafil (optional) salah? Or will nafil salah still be needed to make up the obligatory salah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAmong the wisdom of performing Salaat, one is that Salaat is an Ibaadat%0D%0A(worship) of thanks giving to Allah Ta'ala for all His favours on us.%0D%0AFactually, if we spend every second of our lives to worship Allah, we will%0D%0Anot be able to thank Allah for His infinite bounties upon us.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala, out of His infinite grace has made it compulsory upon us to%0D%0Aperform only 5 times a day. If we cannot even offer this little amount of%0D%0Atime then we should hang our heads down in total shame. After enjoying all%0D%0Ahis bounties and this appreciation.%0D%0A%0D%0AConsider our situation, if we had to do someone a favour and he couldn't%0D%0Afind the time to say, 'Jazaakallah' how would we feel? Our Ibaadat does not%0D%0Aincrease Allah's honour in any way. Allah Ta'ala is not in need of our%0D%0AIbaadat. We are the beneficiaries of our Ibaadat.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is true that the Thawaab and virtue of a Salaat performed within its time%0D%0Ais much more than the Qadhaa Salaats. However, that is no excuse for not%0D%0Aperforming Qadhaa Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf a person sincerely repents for not performing Salaats timeously, it is%0D%0Ahoped that Allah Ta'ala will accept the Qadhaa Salaat and forgive the sin of%0D%0Anot performing the Salaat timeously. This hope obviously will come from one%0D%0Awho is sincere in his regret. A true of sincerity is that he will ensure%0D%0Aperforming all his Salaat timeously.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is also advisable as part of your repentance to offer Nafl Salaat to make%0D%0Aup for the shortfall in the Fardh as stated in a Hadith of Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), the meaning of which is, 'The first act to be%0D%0Areckoned for on the day of Qiyaamat will be Salaat. If the Salaat is in%0D%0Aorder then this person is in ruin and destruction. And if there is a%0D%0Ashortfall in his Fardh Allah Ta'ala shall say, 'See if my servant has any%0D%0ANafl (optional) Ibaadat to his record. Then the shortfall shall be completed%0D%0Awith this Nafl, thereafter all other Ibaadat shall be accounted for%0D%0Aaccordingly.' (Mishkaat vol.1 pg.117; Qadeemi)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
