  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-o-alaikum, Respected Mufti sahab, I want to know about the phenomenon of NASKH/MANSOOKH of Quranic ayaat, as Allah has described in ayah 2:106, give some examples and answer the question in such a way that I can explain this issue to those people who does not believe in NASKH/MANSOOKH(abrogation) of ayaat.? lease reply me as soon as possible as many people like Munkireene Hadees are deceiving muslims about this issue, Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNaasikh refers to an Ayat previously mentioned in the Quraan. The Ayat which was removed is called Mansookh. By Naasikh replacing an Ayat of Mansookh in the Quraan does not mean that the Mansookh Ayat was wrong, but rather it was appropriate only for a particular period of time. Therefore Allah replaced the Ayat to fit the demands of that time. This is the Hikmat of Allah. Take for example; a doctor will diagnose every patient according to his sickness. For a different person is a different%0D%0Adiagnosis. This example fits under the same Usool, which according to different situations%2Fdemands things will change. Those that are of the opinion that Naasikh, Mansookh are not in the%0D%0AQuraan have this thought imbedded in their minds, that if there is such a thing then it is considered a flaw from the side of Allah, just as the jews say. This a very shallow way of thinking. There are glaring examples in the Quraan of Naasikh, Mansookh wherein Allah Ta'aala%0D%0Athrough his Hikmat changed the Qiblah from Baitul Maqdis to the Kaaba of Allah. Also in the Ayat 2:106, one interpretation of the Ayat made by%0D%0Athose who deny Naasikh, Mansookh is that Allah Ta'aala says, \"If we made Naskh of any Ayat then we would have brought a better Ayat.\" This is a%0D%0Afar-fetched Tafseer which they have twisted to fit their opinion. The correct Tafseer of this Ayat is , \"We don't make Naskh of any Ayat except that we will bring a better Ayat.\" The rank of the Quraan demands that it will explain whatever pertains to it, nothing else, just as the%0D%0Amanual of a certain machine will explain only things pertaining to the machine. Therefore, the Quraan itself is telling us in this Ayat, that%0D%0Athere is such a thing as Naasikh and Mansookh.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A============================================"
