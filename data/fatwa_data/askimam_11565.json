  "answer": "QUESTION\nI also suffer from the fact of urine or emmissions after making wudhu. This has made me make my salaat over and over again, The problem I encounter is usually only during salaat 9/10 salaats I have this problem. however during the rest of the day it is not such a big problem. Can I be classified as mazoor. The problem is very embarassing and I have resorted to making namaaz at home. Please advise. Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA person will only be classified as Ma?zoor if one complete Salaat time passes in a situation where the drops of urine flow to the extent that one does not get time to make Wudhu and perform Salaat. That is not so in your case.\n\nWhen you intend to perform Salaat, at that time fill up the hole of the private part with cotton or anything else, in such a way that the inner part of the cotton absorb the urine and there is no traces of impurity on the outer side.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
