  "question": "Is it halal to use this kind of debit card?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI pray this question finds you in good health and Iman.\n\nA local bank issues prepaid debit cards in such a way that if the initial deposit is less than 100 Eur, then the setup fee will be 5 Eur.  If it's between 100 and 500 Eur, the fee is 7.5 Eur.  If it's above 500 Eur the fee is 10 Eur.  For any additional future deposit there's no such fee.  Of course, there are fees that are charged when a transaction occurs, monthly administration fees etc., but this initial fee is a bit problematic.\n\nIs it halal to use this kind of debit card?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nAt the outset, it is important to mention that the system of conventional banking is completely against the rules and principles of Shari’ah.\n\nIf it is possible to avoid the use of the debit card and the conventional bank, one should do so. However, out of darurah (necessity) ‘Ulama have given the permissibility to utilize its services. While one is using the bank’s services, tawbah and istighfaar should be made consequently.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
