  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a short question about taking an oath or swearing on the name of Allah.  Today I was talking with my friend and I said Wallahi as I thought somthing never happened as it never happened in front of me.  But couple minutes later i found out that happened.  Do i styll have to keep the kaffarah for breaking it or, since my intention was clean is it okay as I thought it never happened.  Also what is the kaffarah for breaking the oath.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nOaths are of three types:\n\nGhamoos\nLaghw\nMunaqidah\n\n \n\nGhamoos\n\nGhamoos is a false oath which a person takes regarding the past or present knowing that it is false.\n\nThe ruling of this oath is that a person will be sinful. He should make tawbah and repent to Allah Ta’ala. There is no kaffarah in this oath.\n\n \n\nLaghw\n\nLaghw refers to that oath which a person took regarding the past or present thinking it to be true whereas it was false. Laghw also includes those promises which are always on people’s tongues.\n\nIt is hoped that a person would be forgiven for this type of an oath.\n\nThe scenario in your query falls under this category.\n\n \n\nMunaqidah\n\nMunaqidah is an oath which a person takes regarding the future.\n\nIf a person breaks such an oath he will have to give kaffarah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
