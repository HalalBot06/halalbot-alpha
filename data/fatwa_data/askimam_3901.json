  "question": "Is it jaiz for a male to teach a ghair mahram how to properly read Qur'an (not recite melodiously) from behind a pardah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu 'Alaikum Mufti Sahib, also is it compulsory to have a partition (pardah) separating males and females at a gathering where both Muslims and non-Muslims are present? We want to hold an event for da'wah on a university campus. Jazakallah khair. Sorry for asking 2 questions.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Even though a male may teach females from behind a purdah, they are not\ntotally free from being ensnared by any fitnah. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyyah\nvol,14, p.g396). It will hence be advisable that a female teaches females.\n2. Yes, it is necessary to have a partition separating the males and females\nfor any event.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
