  "question": "I want to know when a Muslim woman takes a shower after menstruation, what does she do to cleanse herself. What is the routine done after menstruation and what is said.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA woman should take a bath after menstruation in the Sunnat manner, i.e. first, she should wash both hands and thereafter clean the private parts after which Wudhu will be made, then the head should be washed 3 times and water should be poured over the whole body. Standing under the shower will suffice for the above. After a bath, the woman should apply some fragrance to the place where the blood was discharged. (Mishkaat vol.2 pg.34) and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai FATWA DEPT."
