  "question": "Is writing for Tashkeel a Sunnah after the Tablighi Bayan?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI heard from a person that it is sunnah.. he told me 2 hadith.. once nabi(sw) told sahaba(rd) to write the names of the ppl who recite kalima..one narration said 700 another said 1500 names were listed.. also from another hadith when list was made , one sahabi came & said my wife wants to go for hajj..what should i do? both hadith are more or less in meaning..pls clarify..from these 2 hadith he said it?s a sunnah..\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt was the practice of Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] to record the names of those who were to go out in the path of Allah.\n\nThis is mentioned in the Hadith of Ka'ab ibn Maalik [radhiallaahi anhu] which is mentioned in Sahih Bukhari and Muslim. (Riyaadhus-saaliheen hadith21). This is the basis for writing the names during Tashkeel, as these brothers are giving their names to go out in the path of Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl.
