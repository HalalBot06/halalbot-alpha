  "question": "is it allowed for a person that is just a hafiz and does not have a beard or trims it or shaves it and performs the jummah salaat",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n'For Muslim males to grow a beard is Waajib (compulsory), and to let it grow a fist length is Waajib. Without any Sharée reason to cut or shave is Haraam (totally prohibited). He who does so is a Faasiq (sinner) and to shorten it less than a fist length is Makruh Tahrimi (near Haraam).' Dari Aur Ambiyaa Ki Sunnate, Mufti Saeed Palanpuri.\n\nIf a Faasiq person (one who openly violates the Laws of Allah Taãla e.g. shaving the beard, etc.) leads the Salaat, his Imaamat will be Makrooh-e-Tahrimi (close to Haraam). However, following such an Imaam does not invalidate the Salaat and does not necessitate to repeat the Salaat. People responsible for appointing such persons will bear the sin.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
