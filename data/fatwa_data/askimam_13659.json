  "question": "Many sunni ulema (not just barelwi), of all four madhahib, are of the opinion that saying \"Ya Rasoolullah\" if one does not consider rasoolullah (S.A.W.) to be hazir wa nazir is alright",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like to ask is deoband a sect or school of thought. There are scholars who differ with deoband on some topics on which the deobandis hold particular beliefs. For example, Many sunni ulema (not just barelwi), of all four madhahib, are of the opinion that saying \"Ya Rasoolullah\" if one does not consider rasoolullah (S.A.W.) to be hazir wa nazir is alright. i.e. it depends on nyat. Many sunni scholars from all four madhahib for example the Syrian trained hanafi scholars such as Sidi Faraz Rabbani of Sunnipath.com, consider saying 'Ya Rasoolullah madad\" permissible if the person believes that helper is only Allah and all power resides only with him.Many sunni scholars also allow milad within some restrictions such as it should not be considered obligatory.\n   My question is not your opinion on these topics, rather i want to ask, are the scholars of sunnipath.com and other scholars of similar views across the world considered by deoband to be ahlussunah with difference of opinion with deoband, or are they considered ahlubid'ah and ulema-e-soo. Please note that Sidi Faraz Rabbani has good relations with several deobandi ulema who help him with his site.\n   Are deobandis less tolerant of difference of opinion than others?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAt the outset, it should be understood that there are certain aspects in Deen that are initially permissible, but due to outside factors they have become impermissible.\n\nThree aspects were mentioned in the question: a) To say ‘Yaa Raroolullah’ without the belief that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] is Haadhir and Naadhir, b) Saying ‘Yaa Rasoolullah Madad’ with the belief that only Allah can help, and c) Celebrating meelaad within some limitations.\n\nSaying ‘Yaa Rasoolullah’ without the belief that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] is Haadhir and Naadhir and celebrating Meelaad without considering it obligatory or part of Deen was initially permissible according to the Ahlus sunnah Wal Jamaa. But when the Ulama of Ahlus sunnah Wal Jamaa had noticed these practices exceeding their limits, they put a stop to it for the sole purpose of protecting the Deen in its prestine purity. Therefore, those scholars that still allow these practices are following the initial verdict on the matter. However, if the restrictions are not upheld, they also consider it impermissible. Today it is noticed that people attach more importance to Meelaad and Salaami than to Fardh Salaat. Therefore, it is clear that these practices are considered obligatory, hence, rendering them impermissible according to all the scholars of the Ahlus sunnah Wal Jamaa.\n\nAs for ‘Yaa Rasoolullah Madad’ which mean ‘O Rasulullah, help us’ with the belief that only Allah can help, there is some inconsistency with the statement and one’s condition if one believes on Allah can help, why should he ask Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] ‘s help? The view of the permissibility of this statement is not the view of the Ahlus sunnah Wal Jamaa.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
