  "question": "Is it permissible for a man or woman to use perfumes which contain alcohol ? please explain fully !!!!!",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ: Is it permissible to use a perfume, deodorant, etc. which contains alcohol, and if so, can one perform Salaat without washing it off?\nA: It is not permissible to use deodorants that contain alcohol from grapes or date extracts. Such perfumes are impure and Salaat with it is invalid. However, if the alcohol is synthetic, it is pure and permissible to use. Salaat without washing off such perfumes will be valid. Sometimes, it becomes difficult to differentiate between genuine and synthetic alcohol. Thus, to be on the safe side, one should rather prefer using deodorants and perfumes that are labelled as ?alcohol-free?, especially when such perfumes are easily available.
