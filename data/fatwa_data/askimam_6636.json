  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is fatwa on saying \"Ya Shaykh Madad\" ? I have seen people saying \"Ya Shaykh Abdul Qadir Jilani give me 1000 dollars\" \"Ya Shaykh Raza Khan Barelwi give me a new car!!\" is this allowed ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo seek the help of any deceased and pray to him is Shirk. It is not\npermissible to address any deceased by saying 'Yaa Shaykh Madad', 'Yaa\nShaykh Raza Khan.', etc.\n\nIf a Muslim does that, he is out of the fold of Islam, his Nikah will be\nbroken. If he does not renew his Imaan and Nikah, his relationship with his\nwife will be Haraam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
