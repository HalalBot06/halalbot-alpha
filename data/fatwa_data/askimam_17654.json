Allah Hafiz!\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\nNabi صلى الله عليه وسلم said: announce the nikah.\n\n(Ahmad, Ibn Hibban, Tabrani, Ibn Nu’aym, Hakim on the authority of Ibn al-Zubayr رضي الله تعالى عنه)\n\n \n\nالجامع الصغير للسيوطي\n\n1197                - أعلنوا النكاح حم حب طب حل ك عن ابن الزبير\n\n \n\nWe advise you to explain to your parents your situation. You may also consider asking your local ulama or some senior members of your family or community to speak to your parents. If the conditions of nikah were fulfilled in your “secret nikah”, then making another nikah will merely be a formality as your nikah is already done.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\nMl.
