  "question": "Can i muslim women have a water birth?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan i muslim women have a water birth?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAccording to our understanding, the purpose of the water birth is to achieve maximum comfort and to minimize the pains of childbirth; therefore, there seems to be nothing contrary to the dictates of the Sharī‘ah by delivering a baby in this manner. However, we would advise the father and mother to discuss the matter with medical professionals, preferably Muslim doctors, to ensure that the procedure is safe for mother and child. The surveys that we have reviewed have shown that the possibility of harm is negligible. However, the opinion of medical professionals should still be sought as a matter of precaution. It should also be noted that the water birth method is definitely more preferable than a caesarian section, which affects the health of the mother and generally limits her ability of delivering more than three to four children. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
