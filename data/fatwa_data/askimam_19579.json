  "question": "Do we have to do Qurbani of a male and female animal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIn our area there is a concept of two animal Qurbani on behalf of a single family. (A separate male and a separate female). I would like you to enlighten it.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nThe obligation of qurbāni is executed when one sacrifices a goat, sheep or has a 1/7th share in a cow or camel. This means that one goat or sheep will only suffice for the qurbāni of one person whereas a cow or camel will suffice for up to seven people. Anything a person sacrifices or pays for more than this will be voluntary. In light of this, if a family consists of seven people or less, one cow or camel will suffice. However, if it consists of more people, further animals will have to be sacrificed accordingly. For example, if a family consists of nine individuals, they can sacrifice one cow or camel (which will suffice for seven of them) and a further two sheep (or goats, or a mixture of the two)\n\nThus if a family has up to 14 individuals, it will suffice for them to sacrifice two animals (cow or camel.)\n\n\nHowever, the notion that two animals- a male and a female- have to be sacrificed even if there are seven people or less in the family- Or that both genders have to sacrificed even if there are more than seven people is incorrect as this is innovating into shariah and enforcing that which has no weight or stance in shariah(لزوم ما لا يلزم  ).[1]\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Husain Kadodia\n\n\n\n\n[1]احسن الفتاوى, ج.١, ص٣٥٣,H.M.Saeed"
