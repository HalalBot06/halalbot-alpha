  "question": "graves, spiders and mujahideen",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWill the Prophets be questioned like normal people in the Grave?\n\nAre we allowed to kill spiders? I always let them escape because of the spider(s) that were commanded by ALLAH Subhanahu wa ta’ala to construct the web on gare-thawr saved our Nabi Sallallahu Alaihe Wassallam.\n\nIn war, are the Mujahideen allowed to disseminate misinformation (lies) about successes etc to misinform the enemy? What would be termed permissible and what impermissible?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The purpose of questioning in the grave is to examine the Imaan of a person. It is our belief that all Ambiyaa (Alayhimus salaam) were born and died with Imaan. The most preferred opinion is that they will not be questioned in the Qabr. (Sharhul Aqaaid pg.99; Kutub Khana Imdadia)\n\n2. The Ulama have differences of opinion with regards to the killing of spiders. Some Ulama dislike the killing of spiders due to not having made a web at the cave of Thawr for the protection of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). A view of Hadhrat Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu) is also supportive of this opinion. However, Tha’laby and ibn Atiyya have narrated another Riwaayat of Hadhrat Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu), ‘Cleanse your homes from the webs of spiders because leaving it creates poverty.’ None of the above riwaayaats are authentic. But the second view is supported by other Ahaadith which suggests a person to keep his homes and courtyards clean.’ (Ma’ariful Qur’aan part6 pg.682; Darul Kitab)\n\n3. In a Hadith, Hadhrat Jabir (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrated that Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ‘War is deception.’ (Mishkaat pg.342; Qadeemi). According to commentators of the Hadith, it is permissible to speak lies to the Kuffaar enemy at the time of war.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
