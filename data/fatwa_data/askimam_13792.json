  "question": "an amount is deducted from our pay to be added in a fund called the Graduaty Provident Fund (GPF). At the end of the year a profit is given on the total amount deducted during that year",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have an employment in Pakistan. According to Government rules, every month, an amount is deducted from our pay to be added in a fund called the Graduaty Provident Fund (GPF). At the end of the year a profit is given on the total amount deducted during that year. This profit is termed as interest, but the interest rate is different every year.\nThe next year, monthly amounts are added to the previous years amount , and interest is given on the total amount which comprises of the total from the current year and the total profit from the previous year.\n\nThere is no way to draw that amount from the fund and invest it yourself.\nIs this money halal???\n\nAccording to some it is the responsibility of the Govt to invest in the right business.  Can i use this money for myself? Can i use this money to pay Govt taxes?\n\nThere is no other investment  for employees. This is the only investment for us. If we dont take profit then we are only left with the sum of the monthly amounts which is not a lot.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf the GPF (Gratuity Provident Fund) distributed a profit every year, that is permissible. If it distributed interest, it is not permissible.\n\nIt is important to determine whether the amount distributed is profit or interest. If it is interest, then that money could be used to pay the government taxes.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
