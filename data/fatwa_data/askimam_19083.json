  "question": "Is it permissible to eat fish with milk and other dairy products?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it permissible to eat fish with milk?\n\nWhat if they are cooked together (as opposed to drinking a glass of milk), or the dairy product in question is cheese, yogurt etc?\n\nIf it is haram or makruh to do so, how much time must elapse before one can consume milk?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nThe Sharī‘ah does not prohibit the combination of fish and dairy products while consuming or cooking, although some scholars in the past, based on the medical research available at the time, have cautioned against such a combination, as they believed it was harmful for the body.  However, if modern-day medicine proves otherwise, then there would be no harm in consuming or cooking fish with milk and other dairy products.\n\nومن تدبّر أغذيته صلى الله عليه وسلم وما كان يأكله وجده لم يجمع قَطّ بين لبن وسمك، ولا بين لبن وحامض، ولا بين غذائين حارَّين، ولا بارِدين، ولا لَزجين، ولا قابضين، ولا مُسهلين، ولا غليظين، ولا مرخيين، ولا مستحيلين إلى خلط واحد...وكل هذه الأنواع ضار مولِّدٌ لأنواع من الخروج عن الصحة والاعتدال\n(الطب النبوي، فصل في هديه صلى الله عليه وسلم في هيئة الجلوس للأكل: ص 181، العربي)\n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMuftī Abrar Mirza\nChicago, IL (USA)\n\n\nUnder the Supervision of Muftī Ebrahim Desai (South Africa)\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER – AskImam.org questions\n\nAskImam.org answers issues pertaining to Sharī’ah.
