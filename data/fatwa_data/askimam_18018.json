She has to observe the laws of Hijāb in his regard.\n\n \n\n2.      Your wife grew up in her uncle’s home after the demise of her mother. He had supported and taken care of her in that period. It is fair that she visits him and expresses her gratitude to him for that. As her husband, you should also support this moral responsibility.\n\n \n\nHowever, it is important that she fulfils this moral responsibility maintaining the laws of Sharī’ah. You are her husband and she cannot visit him without your consent. Furthermore, her uncle is a non mahram to her. She has to observe the laws of Hijāb in his regard. Therefore, we advise that both of you visit the uncle from time to time. In this manner, the laws of Sharī’ah will be maintained and the moral responsibility will be fulfilled.\n\n \n\n3.      She should listen to the advices of her father. It is incorrect for her to be disrespectful to him. \n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
