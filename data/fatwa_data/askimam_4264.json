  "question": "Asalam aleykum What is the islamic logic behind spoiling Wudhuu through poluting air because nothing is washed or cleaned",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe order of performing wudhu and its relevant rules and principals is%0D%0Asimilar to the order of performing salaah and its relevant rules and%0D%0Aprinciple-times for salaah, number of rakaats (units), and categories of%0D%0Asalaah. We, as slaves of Allah, are required to submit and express our%0D%0Asubjugation to our master Allah, by obeying His instructions. Our submission%0D%0Adoes not depend on understanding the wisdoms and logic behind His%0D%0Ainstructions. Allah is All wise and He orders us to perform acts of worship%0D%0Awhich is filled with wisdom. Our limited minds and deficient understanding%0D%0Amay not be able to comprehend the wisdoms and logic behind the order.%0D%0AHowever, the passing of wind invalidating wudhu is understood as particals%0D%0Aof impurity exiting from the body, (resulting in polluting the air) similar%0D%0Ato urine, etc. In brief, the Fuqaha (Jurists) have categorised such rulings%0D%0Aas Ghair Mudrak-BIL - Raai (cannot be perceived by ones mind).%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
