  "answer": "QUESTION\nI just wanted to ask with regard to isti'anat or saying things like\"ya ghous madad\", that the folks at sunnipath seem to be saying that the majority of ahlussunnah consider it alright. Ofcourse you said it is incompatible with ahlussunnah. Is it true that only deoband hold this opinion on isti'ana, or do other scholars among shafi'is, malikis, and traditional hanbalis also hold this view? if so can you give any examples of non deobandi sunnischolarship9scholars, institutions) that holds a similar view to you on isti'ana?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nTo seek the assistance of anyone besides Allah and regard that person as the sole helper as Allah is Shirk. There is no second opinion on this. To say, ‘Yaa Ghawth Madad’ (O Ghaus, help) referring to Sheikh Abdul Qaadir Jilani and regarding him to be the sole helper is Shirk.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
