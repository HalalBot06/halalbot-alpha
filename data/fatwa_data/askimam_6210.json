  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy father treats my mother badly and does not practice Islam nor is afraid of anything. I am a married woman, my mother wants me to get involved, my husband wishes that i don't. What should I do. My father beats and treats my mom and sister like animals caged...and it is not for Islam...it is for his own power. They are also living in haram, he divorced her islamically, but not by court. My mother wants to leave, and take my sister. Can they? Would it be wrong?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf your father divorced your mother and he did not revoke the divorce if the\ndivorce was a revocable one, then the marriage bond between them has been\nterminated upon the expiry of your mother's Iddat (waiting period) of\ndivorce.\n\nThe Iddat is three menses if she experiences menses or three months if she\ndoes not experience menses. If she was conceived at the time of divorce,\nthen the Iddat will be till childbirth. If the marriage has been terminated\nas explained above, then it is not permissible for your mother to stay with\nyour father. She must separate from him immediately.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
