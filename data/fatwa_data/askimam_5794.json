  "question": "Where does the ulama who compiled the Manzil get the methods of recitation of the do'a from ?? e.g write them in a piece of paper, use safron etc.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. In the question , 5375 it is said that the do'a is as following... A'alamu annallaaha 'alaa kulli shay-in qadeerun, wa anna llaaha wad ahaatwa bikulli shay-in ilmaa. I don't have the arabic with me... I just want to make a clarification on the above part... Was it from the Ath-Thalaq last verse ?? But in that verse it was wa ahaa tha bikulli shay-in ilmaa.. please clarify.. 2. Where does the ulama who compiled the Manzil get the methods of recitation of the do'a from ?? e.g write them in a piece of paper, use safron etc. etc. I would be OK with the recitation of asmaul husna or dzikr... but I stil have doubt on these methods... Is there any based on hadith or practices of the shahabah? I know Nabi s.a.w. have told us to blow on a sick person after reciting some surah.. but other methods i probably just haven't heard (due to the lack of my knowledge) 3. Having read the question regarding how to spread your feet in the 4 mahdzab, is there any source of hadith or whatsoever saying that when you pray in jama'ah your feet have to touch some other brothers' feet ??? 4. Is using paint brush made from hog's hair acceptable in preparing food? for example to oil a pan in the pizza bar ???\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Yes, it is from Surah Talaaq and the correct spelling is, 'A'alamu%0D%0Aannallaaha 'alaa kulli shay-in qadeerun, wa annallaaha qad ahaatha bikulli%0D%0Ashay-in ilmaa.' (Apologise for the typing error)%0D%0A2. These are methods adopted by some Ulama for the purpose of treatment of%0D%0Aspecific ailments. Since there is no Shar'ee ruling attached to it, i.e. it%0D%0Ais not classified as a Sunnah or Mustahabb, etc. there is no need for proof.%0D%0ATreatment of ailments in itself is permissible. However, hereunder is a%0D%0Anarration displaying such deeds to have been carried out by some Sahaaba%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhu):%0D%0AImaam Tirmidhi (RA) has recorded that Sayyiduna Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-Aas%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhu) used to write down a certain Du'aa taught by Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) for protection from fright during the night%0D%0Aand would hang it on the neck of his infant children.' Imaam Tirmidhi has%0D%0Aclassified this narration as Hasan Ghareeb (sound) and Imaam Haakim has%0D%0Aclassified it as Sahih (authentic). See al-Targheeb vol.2 pg.456%0D%0A3. According to our limited knowledge, there is no Hadith that the feet%0D%0Ashould touch for the duration of the entire Salaat. Yes, for the purpose of%0D%0Astraightening the Saff, this (among other things) could be done before%0D%0Acommencing Salaat. Sayyiduna Nu'maan ibn Basheer (Radhiallaahu Anhu) states%0D%0Athat Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) once faced the congregation%0D%0Aand said, 'Straighten your Saffs (thrice). By Allah if you do not do so,%0D%0AAllah will cause your hearts to differ.' Sayyiduna Nu'maan (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhu) says, 'Then I saw that a person would join his shoulders with the%0D%0Ashoulders of his companion and his knees and his ankles with his ankles.'%0D%0A(Sunan Abu Dawud vol.1 pg.457 Hadith 662). Imaam ibn Khuzaymah has%0D%0Aclassified this Hadith as authentic.%0D%0AIt is apparent from this narration that all this was done for the purpose of%0D%0Astraightening the Saffs only. And it should be borne in mind that the%0D%0Ajoining of the ankles is not the only thing mentioned in the narration.%0D%0A4. To take benefit from any part of a hog is not permissible and especially%0D%0Ain this case where other substitutes are available.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
