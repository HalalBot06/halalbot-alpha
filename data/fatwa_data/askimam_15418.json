  "question": "Does one become a kafir by reading behind a kafir such as a jafri or qadyani?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. The new area ive moved into has 3 mosques, jafri, brelwi and ahle hadith. Which one should I give most priority to out of brelwi and ahle hadith?\n\n2. I have a jafari friend and he came to a sunni mosque once just to see how it was. I then went to their mosque to see how it was and stood with the jamaat but I read namaz without the intention of following the imam and I read it according to my hanafi method and then repeated it afterwards. Was this ok? \n\n3. Does one become a kafir by reading behind a kafir such as a jafri or qadyani? Does it affect a persons nika?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1.      You should make an effort to establish a masjid or even a musallah for people of our beliefs and thoughts. The evils of the Barelwis are more than the evils of the Ahle Hadith.\n\n2.      You should not have gone to the Jafri mosque. You probably did that to please your friends. In that case, do not let your friendship compromise with your correct beliefs and practices. The repeated salah is valid.\n\n3.      A person does not become a kafir. He will be sinful for honoring a kafir.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
