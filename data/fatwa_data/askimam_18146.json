  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have read a lot of answers on different Islamic sites, with respect to sins committed by married people, i.e, having sex outside marriage.  But I am still doubtful about something in my case and request for your advice.\n\nQuran says in so many places that ALLAH forgives any sin, however big it be, other then Shirk, when repented by heart.  It is said that ALLAH dislikes, Divorce, the most among all the lawful things in Islam.  And I have also read that, Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) has said: It is better to forgive and accept your wife for her good acts, rather then leaving her for her bad acts.\n\nBased on above are my questions wherein I ask for your advice….\n\n1)      Should I forgive and accept my wife who willfully cheated me not once or twice but for 3 years or can I divorce and expose her. And how will ALLAh look at me in either of my decision?   (Note she had confessed to me only after being caught, but now she says she had gone astray and has realized her mistake and now wants to repent and seek Mercy and Forgiveness from ALLAH.  Also pls note that I live and work abroad in middle east for livelihood, and during these last 3 years I made 3 short visits to India and stayed for 4 to 10 days in each trip and twice I visited and stayed for more then a month, during which she used maintained a very normal and happy relationship with me and once I left she would start again.)\n\n2)      The two persons who committed zina with my wife for 3 years, will they be forgiven by ALLAH, if they repent, or their sin is Huququlibad, something that ALLAH does not forgive?   (One is a married molvi, who is also a Hafiz and Mufti, which I seriously doubt now, and the other is his unmarried younger brother.  Both are well known, respected and trusted a lot in my family. This molvi even tried to have sex after coming from Haj last year, but by then my wife had stopped with him and started with his younger brother, who used to warn my wife about the bad deeds of his elder brother, but himself, lured her to have sex with him and continued until I caught.  Both have cheated me and ruined my peace and happiness of my family for ever.  My wife also said that she cried and begged to this molvi to spare her initially but later on herself got carried away, but as far as his younger brother she says she was madly in love with him and had forgotten me and my love. Suspecting some black magic, I consulted one Alim and he said there is a Jinn on my wife. I am all more confused, pls advise and guide me in this difficult time I am facing.)\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nAt the outset, when accusing one of zina one must keep in mind that it is a serious accusation and should not accuse anyone unless he is absolutely certain about the actual act taking place.\n\n According to what is mentioned by you in the query we understand that your wife either has or wants to repent for the ugly actions committed by her in your absence. Therefore, we see absolutely no reason for you to separate from her, rather, we strongly advise that you accept her repentance and forgive her for her mistakes. Even though your wife and the persons with whom she committed this heinous act with violated your right, it will be a noble and pious act by you to forgive them. Forgiving is a great attribute of our beloved Prophet (SallAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) and Allah Ta’ala which pleases Allah Ta’ala very much. Allah Ta’ala mentions in the Quran:\n\n وَلا يَأْتَلِ أُوْلُوا الْفَضْلِ مِنكُمْ وَالسَّعَةِ أَن يُؤْتُوا أُوْلِي الْقُرْبَى وَالْمَسَاكِينَ وَالْمُهَاجِرِينَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَلْيَعْفُوا وَلْيَصْفَحُوا أَلا تُحِبُّونَ أَن يَغْفِرَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ. (النور: 22)\n\n…Pardon and forgive. Do you not love that Allah should forgive you...\n(Quran 24:22)\n\n يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِنَّ مِنْ أَزْوَاجِكُمْ وَأَوْلادِكُمْ عَدُوًّا لَّكُمْ فَاحْذَرُوهُمْ وَإِن تَعْفُوا وَتَصْفَحُوا وَتَغْفِرُوا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ.(التغابن: 14)\n\nO you who believe! Verily, among your wives and your children there are enemies for you (who may prevent you from obeying Allah); therefore beware of them! but if you pardon (then) and overlook, and forgive (their faults), then verily Allah is Oft-Forgiving. Most Merciful. (Quran 64:14)\n\nFrom the above mentioned ayaat we understand that if we are forgiving towards others, Allah Ta’ala will be more forgiving towards us. The thought of not forgiving your wife and the others involved are thoughts caused by Shaytaan and should not be paid any heed. To think of the sins committed by oneself and whether he will be forgiven, or whether his repentance is even accepted by Allah Ta’ala are some things one should ponder about. Due to one not forgiving his own wife, if Allah Ta’ala turns away His forgiveness from this person in the hereafter, then he surely will have lost in this life and the hereafter. May Allah Ta’ala make easy for you to forgive your wife and others that were involved. Ameen!      \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
