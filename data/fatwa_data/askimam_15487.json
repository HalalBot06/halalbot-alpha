  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAsalmu Alaikum!!\n\nI did post a question over the weekend, however the email replied saying that the question needs to be resubmitted. My question where can I obtain a Palestinian Shemagh in RSA. I cannot travel , so it has to be via post or something. I tried the internet intertnasionally, however my post got lost and it cost me R 500:00 for the three Shemaghs I never recieved. Can I write to someone or contact  someone. Im in Free State.\n\nLooking out for your reply Insha Allah!!\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDisclaimer : Fiqhi Site - Your question cannot be accepted at this site.
