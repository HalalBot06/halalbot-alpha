  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs valima jayaz on the same day of nikah, i.e., nikah at asar and valima at isha on the same day. What are the islamic ways that husband and wife should fulfil before valima. Whatz the maximum gap between nikah and valima.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, the Sunnat time of Walimah is anytime after the consummation of the marriage. What is meant by forbidden after 3 days is to have the Walimah 'upto 3 days'.\n\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Food on the first day is established. On the second day it is Sunnah and on the third day, it will be Riyaa (boasting). The Walima may also be fulfilled on the day of the wedding before consummation (Awjazul Masalik)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
