  "question": "Umar attacking Fatimas house? What is the history behind it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is the history behind it? Many people have mentioned this to me. is it true? This can be related in sunni books such as Tabari (Volume II, page 443) , Al-Imama wa's-Siyasa, Volume I, page 13, Iqdu'l-Farid, Part III, page 63, Ibn Khaziba in his Kitab-e-Gharrar, Ibn Shahna in Hashiyya-e-Kamil of Ibn Athir Volume XI, page 112. Please help me refute these claims. Are the isnads for these narrations valid?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe do not possess the books which you have made reference to, therefore we do not know what they may contain regarding the topic ?Umar attacking Fatima?s house?. Moreover we do not really know what you intend asking. Which incident are you referring to? If your question is regarding Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu)?s marriage to Umme Kulthum, the daughter of Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu) and Fatima (R.A.), then you should understand that this marriage took place without any force or fight. An authentic book of the Shias named ?Furoo-e-Kaafi?, Vol. 5, Page 346, states that Umme Kulthum was Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu)?s daughter. Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) proposed for her to Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu) during his (Umar?s) Khilaafat, who (Ali) authorised Abbas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) to carry out the marriage contract. Abbas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) did as he was told and had the two of them married publicly. This took place in Thil Qa?dah (11th Islamic month) 17 AH. Umme Kulthum was 14 years old at that time. Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) went through with this marriage in order to acquire the privilege of being related to Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) after he heard the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) saying that every relation whether it be direct or indirect will be of no benefit on the Day of Judgement except for the ones related to me. In this same happiness Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) fixed forty thousand dirhams as Mahar (dowry). Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) acquired a son named Zaid and a daughter Ruqayyah from this marriage.%0D%0A%0D%0AFatima (Radhiallaahu Anhu) passed away in 11 AH. She was not alive at the time of Umme Kulthum?s marriage which leaves no meaning to Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu)?s attacking her house.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe people who say that Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) attacked Fatima (Radhiallaahu Anhu)?s house and forcefully married her daughter have come down to disgracing Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu) and the whole of Bani Hashim. Can such an act be possible in the blessed time of the Sahabah without Sahaabi objecting to it? All these kinds of stories are fabricated.
