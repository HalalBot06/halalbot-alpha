  "question": "What is the Aadaab relating to thanking someone (Muslim or Kufaar)? Can we say \"thank you\" even though all praise is for Allah (SWT)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAlso, how should we address the non-Muslims (men and women) in letters and emails, e.g. when applying for employment? For instance, can we address them with the word 'Dear' etc even though they are not really dear to us?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The religion of Islam is an embodiment of good character and conduct. The Qur?aan and Ahadith are replete with orders and advises of good character and conduct. If any person, Muslim or non-Muslim, renders any assistance, that should be appreciated and expressed as well. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ?That person who did not express his gratitude to people did not express his gratitude to Allah?. One may express gratitude to a non-Muslim by saying, ?Thank you?. One may also state, ?May Allah (God) reward you?. This form of expression will remind the person of Allah.\n\n2. The address ?dear? has become a norm and custom in official correspondences. There is no prohibition in Shari?ah for such an address.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
