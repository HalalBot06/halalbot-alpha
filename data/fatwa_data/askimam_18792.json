  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is the opinion of the Olma-E-Din (Clergies) and Muftiyane Shara-E-Matin (Priests) about the following Problem. Mid Day meal is a govt. scheme and under this scheme mid-day-meal is supplied to the children of primary schools and madarsas. For this the govt. bears all the expenditures including cooking charges. In our city for distributing mid-day meal to the students of a madarsa, a contractor has with drawn about twenty lacks of rupees from the concerned govt. department. The Nazim (Chief Authority) of the madarsa gave a bogus receipt and certificate to the contractor to this effect that the money has been spent in the right way and he (Nazim) him self took the share of the ransome while actually coarse kind of biscuits and some unedible grains were given to the students. The children are not getting the dishes and articles for which the money from the govt. is reimburse and allotted. The children are kept devoid of their shares. The madarsa committee takes no action against the contractors instead they (the office bearers of madarsa) themself are involved in this nefarious activity. The Misuse of govt. money and the manipulation by the committee members of the madarsa and the contractor is legitunate in the eyes of sharaa-or not. If not kindly issue the opinion and the verdict regarding serious problem.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIf the Nāzim of the Madrasah and Madrasah Committee Members are misusing Government’s money that are allocated for the students, then it is completely unlawful and they will be answerable to Allah jalla jalāluhu on the day of justice(qiyāmah). Furthermore, if the intent of the question is to cause discord or the information provided is incorrect, then our answer does not apply.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n\n \n\nMl.
