  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is prohibited to wear pants below the ankle at all times. Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Allah will not look at a person with%0D%0Amercy who lowers his pants below his ankle.' (Bukhari)%0D%0A%0D%0ATo perform Salaat with the pants below the ankles is Makrooh. Therefore, the%0D%0Apants should be folded above the ankles at all times, in particular, during%0D%0ASalaat.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ADespite the stern warnings of Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam)%0D%0Aconcerning the wearing of the trouser below the ankle, some Muslim men%0D%0Atotally disregard this Sunnah. In fact, many argue that this applies to a%0D%0Aperson who wears it below the ankle if pride settles in the heart.%0D%0A%0D%0AHaving said that, it is therefore undisputed by all that wearing the%0D%0Atrousers below the ankle with pride is a major sin. And if worn without%0D%0Apride then too it is a major sin. (Alamgeri), except that should the trouser%0D%0Aunintentionally drop below the ankle then there is no sin. This was the case%0D%0Aof Hazrat Abu Baker (Radhiallahu Anhu) for which Rasulullah (Sallallahu%0D%0Aalayhi wasallam) excused him. It is indeed sad to note that some people of%0D%0Athe Ummah disregard its importance and largely take it for granted.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe warnings admonished by Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) are%0D%0Aexplicit and direct. We cite a few hereunder:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said, 'That which hangs below the%0D%0Aankle, will be in Jahannam. (Bukhari)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Once Hazrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiallahu anhu) entered the gathering of%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam). He says, 'My trouser was hanging a%0D%0Alittle below my ankle when Rasulullah asked, \"who is this\"? 'I replied,%0D%0AAbdullah bin Umar'. Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said, 'If you%0D%0Aare Abdullah then raise your trouser above the ankle.' I immediately did%0D%0Alikewise to the extent of half my shin. From that day onwards I formed a%0D%0Ahabit to wear my trouser above the ankle. (Musnad Ahmad)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. It is reported in a hadith that three people whom Allah Ta'ala will not%0D%0Atalk to nor look at and for them will be a terrible punishment. The narrator%0D%0Asays that Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) repeated this three times.%0D%0AThen Hazrat Abu zar Ghaffari (Radhiallahu anhu) commented saying that these%0D%0Apeople are indeed very unfortunate but who are they? Rasulullah (Sallallahu%0D%0Aalayhi wasallam) said that person who hangs his trouser below the ankle,%0D%0Athat person who does good deeds and lies and that person who takes a false%0D%0Aoath to sell his goods. (Abu Dawood)%0D%0A%0D%0AExplaining the situation Hazrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiallahu anhu) says%0D%0Athat the meaning of Rasulullah's (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) warnings refer%0D%0Ato anything that hangs below the ankle i.e. when wearing the lungi or long%0D%0Aabayya kurtas.%0D%0A%0D%0AAt this point, it will suffice to say that our beloved Nabi (Sallallahu%0D%0Aalayhi wasallam) has presented a certain code of conduct (which forms part%0D%0Aof the Sunnah) and should we claim to love Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi%0D%0Awasallam) then follow his way - the only way for our salvation in this world%0D%0Aand the hereafter."
