  "question": "Can one refuse a proposal without doing istikhara, and based on instinct on speaking to them?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaams mufti, is it fair to judge a marriage proposal and refuse without doing istikhaara when you have spoken to the person and realise that you and a second person in judgement find it hard to conversate with the person and find them boring to talk to. (nothing in common). And on instinct you feel they are not right for you. Or is instinct too little to make this sort of judgement and should you still perform istikhaara?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIstikhaara is only practiced if one is in a dilemma. However, if one is not confused, Istikhaarah is not necessary. In a marriage proposal, we also suggest one consult with his/her seniors as well.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
