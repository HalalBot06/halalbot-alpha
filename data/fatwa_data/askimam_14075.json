  "answer": "QUESTION\nwe live in USA state of Georgia-Atlanta,we have 2 different Qabaa compasses , one is showing the number of Atlanta 29, and the other one is showing the number 34, which is the correct direction to perform our daily salats?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn principle, those who do not see the Ka’abah must face in the direction of the Ka’abah during Salaat. They do not have to face the actual Ka’abah. The Fuqahaa have granted a leeway of 24 degrees to a maximum of 45 degrees deviation from the actual Ka’abah in facing the direction of the Ka’abah. Therefore, the difference of 29 and 34 is not a huge one. It would fall within the 45 degrees leeway granted by the Fuqahaa.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
