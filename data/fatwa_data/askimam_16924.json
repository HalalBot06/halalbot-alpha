  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is a meaning of Ashlatu Wassalumu Alaiyka Ya Rasulallah (S.A.W.S.) it is permissible to recite, as Barelvi recite on Jumma and says it is sawab, and holyn prophet (PBUH) is listen thru' angle of Allah. It is true, kindly give me right answer, Thanks\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n The meaning of \"As Salaatu Wassalaamu Alayka Ya Rasulullah\" is:\n\n\"Blessings and peace be upon you O Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam)\" \n\nReciting durud shareef upon Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) has great reward. Saying \"Ya Rasulullah\" without the belief that Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Waallam) is \"Haazir and Naazir\" is permissible. However, if this practice exceeds its limits then it will not be permitted to do so. It is permissible when greeting Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) to say \"As Salaamu Alayka Ya Rasulullah\" when visiting his blessed qabr in Madinah Munawwarah.\n\n(Fatawa Mahmudiyya, Vol. 1, P. 365, Faruqiyya)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
