  "question": "What direction does a person who is living in Canada face when making Salaah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat direction does a person who is living in Canada face when making Salaah? For example, here in RSA, we face north east when making Salaah as we are on the Southern part of the African continent while Canada is west of RSA and Makkah for that matter too - hence my question.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe general direction of Qibla in North America is North East.\n\nThat will be the direction from North America if the Ka’abah is elevated to the sky.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
