  "question": "Can i take this medication before Salaah as it makes me drowsy?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni suffer with headaches and sinus, the medication i take sometimes make me drowsy, can i in this state of drowsiness read salaat and quraan?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nWe advise you to take the medication after performing the Salaah. However, if that is not possible and the drowsiness does not reach a stage were you loose your senses, such that you cannot distinguish what you are reciting in prayer, then it would be permissible to read Salaah in that situation, although it would be better to read Salaah after the drowsiness disappears.\n\n\n\nعن عائشة رضي الله عنها : أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم قال ( إذا نعس أحدكم وهو يصلي فليرقد حتى يذهب عنه النوم فإن أحدكم إذا صلى وهو ناعس لا يدري لعله يستغفر فيسب نفسه )\n\n(صحيح البخاري, دار الفكر ,ص68 ,ج 1)\n\n\n\n\nNabi Sallalahu Allaihi Wassalam said, “When one of you is tired whilst reading Salaah then he should lie down and take a rest until you no longer drowsy. If one of you would have to read Salaah in the state of tiredness, instead of seeking forgiveness he might curse himself.”\n(Bukhari Vol 1, Pg68, Darul Fikr)\n\n\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
