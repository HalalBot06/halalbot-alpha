  "question": "Can I do internship at the banks? How about if I dont take any salary from them?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nQ.1 i wanted to know if doing an internship, articleship in a Non islamic bank halal. As our main intention there is to get working experience and at the same time One receives a very low salary? Q.2 if i persuade the bank to not pay me any salary whatsoever, i would work free of any income in my internship then would it become Halal for me?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\n \n\nThe principle governing working in a conventional bank will be “Assisting in Sin”.\n\nAllah Ta’āla says\n\nوَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ…\n\nAnd do not assist in sin and oppression…\n\n(Al Qur’ān 5:2)\n\nThe core of a Conventional Bank is interest and other non-Sharī῾ah compliant deals.\n\nIf you wish to get training in the actual banking procedure, then that will fall in the category of assisting in sin. The ruling will be the same  even if you do not take a salary.\n\nIf you wish to gain experience in some other department of the bank for example, a teller or any other department  not related to interest dealings, then there may be a leeway for that.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\n \n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
