Jazak Allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) We have stated to you previously that we can not comment until you clarify the situation with us. %0D%0A%0D%0A2) Islamic economics is a very vast and intricate subject. If one wants to study Islamic economics, he has to also acquaint himself with many other subjects Usool-e-Fiqh, Fiqh etc. This cannot be achieved by just studying for one or two years. %0D%0A%0D%0A3) Usool is not sufficient to master economics. The application of the law is equally important. %0D%0A%0D%0A4) If the azaan is called out while you are in the bathroom, you should complete the wudhu as quickly as possible and then proceed to make the iftaar. Rasulullah (SAW) has encouraged us to hasten in making iftar. Obviously this is after sunset.%0D%0A%0D%0A5) Sehri ends at setting in of Subah Sadiq (true dawn). Therefore as soon as Subah Sadiq sets in one should stop eating immediately. You could refer to your local timetable to determine the time of Subah Sadiq. It is not necessary that azaan is called at Subah Sadiq. Many places the time of sehri ends long before the azaan. %0D%0A%0D%0A6) Anger and frustration are natural characteristics of a human being. It is reported in some ahadith that Rasulullah (SAW) also became angry when the Laws of Shariah were violated. He also gave us a prescription to control anger. Rasulullah (SAW) said \"when in anger recite Taawuz (aaoozubillah hi minash shaytaan ir rajeem)\". In one Hadith Nabi (SAW) said drink water or if you are standing sit down and if you are sitting lie down. This could assist in controlling the anger and frustration. %0D%0A%0D%0A7) This is a spritual malady. Just as for medical ailments we visit doctors, similarly for spiritual ailments there are doctors. You could refer to a reliable, Allah fearing Alim who has experience in the spiritual field to assist you in removing this evil and disastrous trait. If man ponders over his mere creation and different phases of creation this will suffice for him not to have pride. Ponder! what are we made of? What is the human body? nothing but a composition of dirty fluid. What will his pride do? Surely Allah is the Supreme Being to Him belongs all pride. Allah says Pride is my garment and whoever joins me in this garment I will fight with him. Therefore there is no need to embroil yourself in this haughtiness and pride. it will lead to your own destruction. Rasulullah (SAW) said \"one who has an iota of pride will never enter Jannah\". There is no dua to remove pride but one will have to make a practical effort to eradicate this disease. %0D%0A%0D%0A8) You cannot learn Arabic from a dictionary. You will have to learn from a person qualified in the field of Arabic.%0D%0A%0D%0A9) This issue was raised in the previous mail. Your \"lovers\" disinclination to marry you proves the insincere relationship. You should stop this Haraam relationship and continue looking for another suitable partner. You cannot expect to bog yourself for life to a woman who has no direction and goal in life. You need to look ahead and ignore the past. Inshallah you will get a suitable partner.
