  "question": "talking to Allah in du'aa",
  "answer": "QUESTION\none of my friend when shes alone she communicates with Allah, what i mean is that, whenever shes alone it looks like shes talking to herself , but actually shes talking to Allah, shes not insane.. but she usually does this, sometimes before she sleeps she lets out her whole day experience and talks about it to herself, but infact shes referring all this to Allah, for e.g \" Allah i am so confused just help me out with this problem, i really dont understand what to do, i know it happened for a reason but u tell me how should i handle it\" it seems like a prayer but its  more like a communication. Is she ok I know shes fine, but is she and is it wrong to communicate with Allah in this manner? Please Help. Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah is All-Seeing, All-Hearing. He is aware of whatever is concealed in the hearts. Everyone has a different way of communicating with his/her Lord. Therefore, there is no harm if your friend communicates in this manner.\n\n \n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n \n\n<b>Mufti Ebrahim Desai</b>"
