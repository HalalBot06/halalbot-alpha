  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] said, ?Turn you people in repentance to Allah and beg pardon of Him. I turn towards him a hundred times a day.? In view of this, it is obligatory to feel penitence for every sin. There are three condition to be fulfilled for the acceptance of one?s sins: a) Refrain from committing the sin again, b) Feel remorse for the sin committed, and c) Resolve never to indulge in such sins.\n\n2. It is Makrooh to repeat the same Surah in Fardh Salaat if one knows another Surah. If a person does not know another Surah, then it will be necessary for him to repeat the same Surah since it is compulsory for him to read a Surah after Surah al-Faatiha.\n\n3. Mascara will be permissible, if applied with the following conditions; a) Free from any Haraam ingredients, b) Must allow water to pass through, c) Must be for the husband only.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
