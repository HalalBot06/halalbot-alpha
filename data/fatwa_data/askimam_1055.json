  "question": "Do you Believe that Pious Saints have knowledge of the Unseen",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIlm ul-Ghayb (knowledge of the unseen without any medium) is the special\nattribute of Allah Ta'ala. Pious people do not have knowledge of the unseen\nwithout any medium. The Ilm al-Ghayb of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) was through Wahy (revelation) or Kashf (divine inspiration).\n\nThe knowledge of the unseen of pious saints is also by Kashf.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
