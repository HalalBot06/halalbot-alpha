  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nis it allowed to make eyebrows 4 husband with husband permission???\nis it farz on me to  pay my  zakat if my husband doesn't pay my zakat???\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1. It is prohibited for a female to shape her eyebrows even for her husband. Rasulullah (SAW) cursed those women who shape their eyebrows. (Bukhari)\n2. If zakat is due on you, you will be responsible to pay zakat. You husband may pay your zakat with your consent. If he does not do so, you will be responsible to pay your zakat. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
