  "question": "What should be done during witr and qiyam ul lail prayers during ramadhan in Makkah and Madinah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it permissable to perform qiyam ul lail prayers in Makkah and Madinah during ramadhan that take place in jamaat in the middle of the night? I have read the ruling that no more than 2 people should perform nafl jamaat together, does the same rule apply here? If it is not allowed what should be done at that time?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi Math-hab it will not be permissible to perform Nafl Salaat with Jamaat (more than three people) whether it is in Makkah or Madinah, during Ramadhaan or out of Ramadhaan. It is better at that time for one to perform individual Ibaadah.
