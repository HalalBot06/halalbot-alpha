  "question": "Your answers makes one think he can commit as many sins as he wants because Allah forgives eventually. We learnt we will be punished before forgiven",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two issues regarding sinning and forgiveness. If one commits sins due to following his/her base desires, and then realises his/her mistakes and repents, then Allah is Most Merciful and will forgive one?s sincere repentance. Sincere repentance is to regret the past and make a firm intention never to repeat the sin.\n\nIf a person is sincere, he will endervour not to repeat the sins. Such a person?s gaze is on Allah?s both qualities Rahmaan (Merciful) and Muntaqim (Punisher). A Mu?min has to keep in front of him both the qualities of Allah and Allah will respond to a believer?s repentance according to his approach.\n\nIf the person is not sincere in his repentance and does so only as procedure, such a person is not sincere and cannot expect the forgiveness and mercy of Allah. Such an insicere person incurs the anger and wrath of Allah upon himself.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
