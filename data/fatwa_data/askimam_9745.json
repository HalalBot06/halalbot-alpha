  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, it is permissible to work at a food outlet, that is strictly Halaal. If the food outlet is not strictly Halaal, then generally it is not permissible to work there.\n\nIn order to ascertain if food outlet is strictly Halaal, the following guidelines may be adopted:\n\n1. The manager of the outlet must be a Muslim who also conforms to the standard of an Aadil person as stipulated by the Fuqahaa. In brief, an Aadil Muslim is he who is sensitive to his religion by practising on it. He does not deliberately violate the laws of the Shari?ah.\n\n2. The person is well versed on the Shari?ah laws of Halaal and Haraam. If such a person informs the food is Halaal and there is no sound reason to doubt his information, then his information of Halaal may be accepted.\n\nThe Shar?ee ruling of working at McDonalds should be understood in the light of the abovementioned principles.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
