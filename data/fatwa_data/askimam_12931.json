  "question": "qasar prayer",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am studying in a city which is more than 130 KM away from my home. For the time being I am continuing my studies from my home city. Classes are held for few days a week. Sometimes I return back my home after attending class. On other times when classes are held on consecutive days, I reside there for one night and return back home after attending class on the second day. I leave home after zuhr prayer, therefore I offer asar prayer (four rakats)with zuhr (two rakats) prayer. Further, again I offer asar prayer with zuhr prayer on the day on which I reside there (two rakats for both prayers). Kindly tell me whether I am doing correctly or not? If not, how should I perform prayers during my traveling or stay at another city? Thanks.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to our understanding, your question relates to joining of Salaats while travelling.\n\n1. According to the Hanafi Madhab, you can?t join between two Salaats in one Salaat time.\n\n2. If you stay away from your home for lesser than 15 days, then you should pray Qasr Salaat at that place. You should perform full Salaat while at home.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
