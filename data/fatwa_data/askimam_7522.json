  "question": "Is Sep'11 incident quoted in Quran?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nOne of my tabligh jamath friend (I know he is very pious) told me about one fact. That is, the incident of Sep'11attack is stated in Holy Quran. Let me explain, The WTC attach was happened on 9th month 11the day. In WTC one tower had 109 stories and the another had 110 stories. Now he asked me to open the Hole Quran, goto 9th sure 11th juz (sura tawba) and read 109 & 110 aayaths. I just wonder by seeing it. It can not be just a co incident beause Quran is not a book of co-incidents. It is a book of facts and truths about past and future. So I can not neglect it. The same fact I shared with my other muslim friends also. Now I have two questions, 1. The information in Quran ( 9:109-110) is related to Sep'11 incident (or simillar incidents )? 2. Is it wrong I shared that fact with my friend? Do I need to ask tawba?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the books of Tafseer (commentaries) of the holy Qur'aan, the Aayaat mentioned 11, 9, 110 refers to a specific incident which occurred during the time of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). %0D%0A%0D%0AA person by the name of Abu Aamir Raahib had great animosity for Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and Muslims and had always fought in all the battles against Islam. In the battle of Hunayn, when the tribe of Hawazin was defeated, he lost hope and fled to the kingdom of Shaam. He continued in his effort against Islam until his death. He went to the king of Rome to spur him to fight against the Muslims. In the meanwhile, he had written to the hypocrites of Madinah that he is coming with Khaysar (king of Rome) to attack Madinah, so you (hypocrites) must build a headquarter for them. Thereafter, they had planned to build a house in the form of a Musjid - in order to deceive Muslims. The hypocrites planned to gather their weapons in this so-called Musjid which will be used against the Muslims. Twelve Munaafiqeen then went to Quba which already had a Musjid to build another 'Musjid'. They, then plotted to invite Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) to come and pray in that Musjid in order to further deceive the Muslims. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was preparing for the battle of Tabuk and told them he would come there on his return. %0D%0A%0D%0AUpon his return to Madinah, Allah Ta'ala revealed the plot of the hypocrites. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) commanded the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) amongst whom were Aamir ibn Sakan and Wahshy to destroy that 'Musjid'. (Ma'ariful Qur'aan vol.4 pg.465). %0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore, these Aayaats of the noble Qur'aan referred to an incident that occurred 1400 years ago during the time of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). The occurrence of September 11 are mere coincidences and have no significance and relation to the noble Qur'aan whatsoever. It is also possible that these numerical order s be interpreted in other ways than the way explained above, then in that case what will be the response? E.g. one may say instead of 11-9-110, 9-11-110. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
