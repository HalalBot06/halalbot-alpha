  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn the Middle Ages, most people believed that the sun moved while the moon%0D%0Awas standstill. But according to the verse of the Glorious Holy Quran given%0D%0Ato Prophet Muhammad (Peace be Upon Him) by the one and only Supreme Being,%0D%0AAllah, both the sun and the moon have their orbit and the sun is in the%0D%0Acenter of the universe where the planets transverse around. These verses%0D%0Arevealed 1400 years ago before major scientists around the world established%0D%0Athis fact.%0D%0A%0D%0AHere are some of the verses given in the Quran:%0D%0A%0D%0A1.) \"Allah is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that ye can see;%0D%0Athen He established Himself on the Throne; He has subjected the sun and the%0D%0Amoon! Each one runs (its course) for a term appointed. He doth regulate all%0D%0Aaffairs, explaining the signs in detail, that ye may believe with certainty%0D%0Ain the meeting with your Lord. Surah 13 (Ar-Ra'd), Verse 2.%0D%0A%0D%0A2.) \"He(Allah) created the heavens and the earth in true (proportions): He%0D%0Amakes the Night overlap the Day, and the Day overlap the Night: He has%0D%0Asubjected the sun and the moon (to His law): each one follows a course for a%0D%0Atime appointed. Is not He the Exalted in Power - He Who forgives again and%0D%0Aagain?\" Surah 39 (Az-Zumar), Verse 5.%0D%0A%0D%0A3.) \"And the Moon,- We have measured for her stations (to traverse) till she%0D%0Areturns like the old (and withered) lower part of a date-stalk.\" Surah 36%0D%0A(Yaseen), Verse 39.%0D%0A%0D%0A4.) \"It is not permitted to the Sun to catch up the Moon, nor can the Night%0D%0Aoutstrip the Day: each (just) swims along in (its own) orbit (according to%0D%0ALaw).\" \"Surah 36 (Yaseen), Verse 40.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
