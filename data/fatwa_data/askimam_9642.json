  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs'Salamu Alaikum Mufti sahib, is it haraam or makrooh to crack your knuckles of any joint in the masjid? 2. In my 40 days kharooj, I saw brothers doing massah on their shoes and praying with shoes too, they are followers of Imam Shafi'e. They say there is a Hadith stating about this. But what I knew was it is only allowed in Jihad. Could you please verify this, 'cuz I dont agree with this concept and aslo I myself am Follower of Imam Shafi'e?? 3. If the person leads the prayer with shoes on, will that prayer be valid or I have to say it again?? 4. Could you tell me with respect to Hanafi madhab, one of the Hanafi brother is doing this too? 5.
