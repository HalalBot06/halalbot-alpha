  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nplease can you tell inform me the correct method of shaving the male areas. WHat needs shaving and how dhould it be done?\nWhat if you are cleaning the private parts and wile cleaning accidentally sperm comes out? is this ok?\nIs contraception allowed in islam, i.e the use of condoms? because this is having sex for recreational purposes, is this allowed in islam?\nCan the woman drink the husbands semen?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1) Islam places a lot of emphasis on every form of cleanliness be it internal or external, spiritual or physical. Allah Ta’ala says in the Noble Quran:\n\n \n\n{ إن الله يحب التوابين ويحب المتطهرين (البقرة 222) }\n\nSurely Allah loves those who are most repenting,\n\nand loves those who keep themselves pure. [2:222]\n\n \n\nNabi صلى الله عليه و سلم said:\n\nعن أبي هريرة عن النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم قال\n\n: الفطرة خمس ( أو خمس من الفطرة ) الختان والاستحداد وتقليم الأظفار ونتف الإبط وقص الشارب\n\n “Five things are from amongst the fitra (nature of mankind) circumcision, shaving the pubic region, clipping the nails\n\nplucking the armpits and trimming the moustache”. (Bukhari 5889 Muslim 620)\n\n \n\nIt is clear from the above narration that a person should remove his moustache, hair under the armpits and the below the navel. It is wajib (necessary) to clean the hair growing on the pelvis. It is preferable to clean hair growing on the thighs and posteriors which has the possibility of becoming soiled. It is also preferable to clean the hair directly below the navel. A person also should clean himself on a weekly bases or at least every forth night. It is a sin to let forty days pass by without cleaning oneself.\n\nMahmoodiyyah 19/446 Farooqia\n\nAhsaul Fatawa 8/77-8\n\nالفتاوى الهندية  - (ج 5 / ص 358(\n\nويبتدئ في حلق العانة من تحت السرة\n\n2) There is no reason for sperm to come out when merely cleaning the private parts. When cleaning the private parts, one should avoid doing any haram act.\n\n \n\n3)\n\n CONTRACEPTION\n\nContraception is permissible on a limited scale for valid reasons - reasons considered by the Shariah to be valid. The circumstances which will permit reversible and permanent contraception differ.\n\nREVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTION\n\nAmong the reasons accepted by the Shariah as valid for practising reversible contraception are:\n\n(A)  Physical weakness.\n\n(B)   Sickness.\n\n(C)  The wife maintaining her beauty or figure for the sake of her husband.\n\n(D)  The couple being on a journey or in a distant land.\n\n(E)   Adverse political conditions, e.g. children are forcibly separated from their parents as is advocated by communism; etc.\n\n(F)   The couple decide to separate in the near future.\n\n(G)  The wife is an immoral person.\n\nThere are valid grounds for practising reversible contraception. Poverty or the fear of poverty are not valid reasons for contraception. It is not permissible to practice contraception on account of a fear of not being able to provide for a large family. Such a fear is an attribute of non-Muslims. According to the Quran Shareef: 'There is not a living creature, but its sustenance is the responsibility of Allah.'\n\nSimilarly desire to curb sexual desire which may stem out of piety is not a lawful ground for contraception. If practised for any reason which is unlawful in Islam, then contraception will likewise be unlawful, e.g. for indulgence in illicit sex.\n\nPERMANENT CONTRACEPTION\n\nPermanent contraception is permissible only if the woman's life is in danger or her health is seriously threatened.\n\n4) It is not permissible.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
