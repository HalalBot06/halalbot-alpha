  "question": "Marriage proposals to a bearded person",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow important should the beard and the dressing (i.e. pants above theankles, etc.) be when a woman is considering a marriage proposal. Should sherefuse the proposal if the man doesn't possess a beard, and wears pantsbelow his ankles, although his character may be excellent?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHazrat Abu Hurairah (RA) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) said, 'When a person proposes a marriage to you (for a female in%0D%0Ayour family) and you are happy with his religion and character, then marry%0D%0Ahim (accept his proposal). If you do not do that, there will be corruption%0D%0Aand widespread evil on earth.' (Mirqaat, Ali ibn Sultan vol. 6 pg. 192 -%0D%0AMultan)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above hadith provides two guidelines for a female to consider a%0D%0Aproposal:%0D%0A%0D%0AOne) The males adherence to Deen.%0D%0A%0D%0ATwo) The males good character.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn order to establish and maintain a successful marriage, both guidelines,%0D%0Aadherence to Deen and good character are equally important. However, the%0D%0Alevel of the boys adherence to Deen (for example keeping a beard and pants%0D%0Aabove the ankles etc.) is not been specified in the Shariah. It is left to%0D%0Athe discretion and satisfaction of the guardians of the proposed girl.%0D%0AObviously their concern is the girls peace and prosperity. In a reply to a%0D%0Asimilar question from a concerned father, Moulana Ashrah Ali Thanvi replied,%0D%0A'I . that full religiousness is not to be found in bearded people. One%0D%0Ashaves the beard, one is irreligious in other ways so what will you do with%0D%0Aonly the beard. Look at two things: 1) no doubt in Islamic beliefs. 2)%0D%0Arespectful of elders and saints, and kind hearted to fulfill his duties and%0D%0Awith some wealth. Then with increasing relationship no matter his beard will%0D%0Aalso grow. A father approached Hazrat Hasan Basri (RA) saying, I have only%0D%0Aone daughter and received many proposals for her. Which proposal should I%0D%0Aaccept? He replied, accept the proposal of a person who fears Allah, if he%0D%0Aloves your daughter, he will honour her, and if he dislikes her, he will%0D%0Aoppress her. (Mirqatul Ali-ibn Sultan vol. 6 pg. 188 - Multan).%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best.%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0A"
