  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI want to ask that if the world is gonna be destroyed n avery thing is finished. Y realtions are made, we love our loved ones they come to us...n one day they leave n never come back..is this not a suffering, Y Allah has created them if on the day of judgment no one will help no one. even a mother will not help her child...\n\nWhat is the ruling reg a un married girl who attends a funiral(see the face of the dead person). do she has to take bath after coming back from that funiral.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1.      Allah is out Creator. He is also Al-Hakeem (Wise). Every act of Allah is with wisdom. Allah creating us, our families and beloved ones and sending us in this world is by the order of Allah. Death is also by the order of Allah. As the creation and obedient slaves of Allah; our attitude should be to submit to the will and decree of Allah. It suffices to console us that everything of Allah regarding us is the perfect choice as it comes from Allah, who is Al-Hakeem. He can never be wrong in any decree and any choice.\n\nIt is understood from the Quran and Ahadith that our life in this world is regarded as Darul Imtihaan (the World of Test). Allah tests us in different ways. He also tests us through people around us. To love people and then be separated from them is indeed painful. Allah tests us through such feelings. He tests our reactions and focus of life at that time. He says in the Quran, “And we will test you with some fear, hunger and decrease in wealth and souls and fruits”. When Allah takes away the life of our beloved ones, say “Inna Lillahi Wa Inna Ilaihi Rajioon” (We belong to Allah and to Allah will we return)\n\nAs believers, we believe in life after death. There we will meet our beloved ones if we were obedient to Allah in this world, Inshallah. Allah says, “And we will join with them (the believers) their children (in the hereafter)”.\n\nIn brief, the separation is indeed a suffering but that suffering is a test from Allah through the Devine decree and wisdom of Allah. We submit to that.\n\n2.      One does not have to take a bath when returning from a funeral.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
