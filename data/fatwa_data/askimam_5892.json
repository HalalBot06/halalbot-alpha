  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaams brother! I would like to know the answers to the following 3 questions: (1) I was praying Maghreb salaat with Jamaat and in the second sajda of the last rakaat I raised my head before the Imam said ?Allahuakbar.? Did I have to perform Sujood-e-Sawh or was I to just carry on and finish my salaat in the normal manner? Is my salaat invalid for raising my head in haste?? (2) Who are the Awliya Ikraam of the present day?? (3) What dua/wazeefa is best to read for the business and for it to prosper and keep it safe?? Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It was incorrect and sinful of you to do so. However, Sajdah Sahw was not\nnecessary. Your Salaat is valid. All you were required to do thereafter, was\nto continue the Salaat with the Imaam.\n2. A pious person adhering to the Sunnah.\n3. For prosperity in business, recite Aayatul Kursi 313 times after the Asr\nSalaat on Friday.\n4. Also, for safety, you may recite Aayatul Kursi and blow upon the\nproperty, business, etc.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
