  "question": "Allah says the Quran cant be changed. How can we prove that this verse was not man made and how do we know the Quran is perfect only because it is from Allah and not because any errors were corrected.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs-Salaamu? alaykum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatu and Eid Mubarak to all true Muslim believers in the heavens and the earth.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly elaborate on this part of your question \"not because any errors were\ncorrected\".\nHowever, the fact that the Qur'aan is from Allah is self explanatory to the\nperfection of the Qur'aan, as Allah Ta'ala is Himself Subhaan (perfect). The\nQur'aan challenges any one who doubts the authenticity of the Qur'aan to\nbring forth a single verse like the Qur'aan. The Arabs of the time of\nRasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam were experts in Arabic and after\nhaving exhausted every opportunity to de-authenticate the Qur'aan, they\nfailed. The challenge stood its ground until today and will remain until\neternity.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
