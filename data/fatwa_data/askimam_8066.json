  "answer": "QUESTION\na) non-mahram guys b) Muslim women and mahram guys c) non-muslims women? 2) If you ask you parent's permission to do something (nothing haram or gunnah act) and they give you the permission but you know they don't want you doing that thing, is it still disobeying your parents and gunnah? In other words they give you the permission but you know they don't want you doing it. The child is baaligh but not married and living with parents. The matter asked could be anything general (like asking to go somewhere) or something big and important. 3) Also, would the child have to listen in above mentioned situations if he/she is married?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour first question may be categorised as follows: a) non-Mahram males, b) Muslim and non-Muslim female, c) Mahram males.%0D%0A%0D%0Aa) Hijaab form non-Mahram males: The ruling is that a female?s entire body including her face is Awrah and has to be covered in front of non-Mahram males. (Fataawa Darul Uloom vol.2 pg.1030; Karachi)%0D%0A%0D%0Ab) Hijaab from Muslim and non-Muslim sisters: The ruling is that a woman?s body from her navel upto and including her knees has to be covered. (Mukhtasar al-Qudoori pg.742)%0D%0A%0D%0Ac) Hijaab from Mahram male: A woman has to cover her back and stomach uptil and including the thighs in front of Mahram sales. (Ibid pg.743)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn principle, if there is fear of desire and Fitnah, then a woman has to cover her body in front of women and Mahram men also, and nowadays as Fitnah like incest and lesbianism has become so wide spread that it has become necessary for women to observe caution with women and Mahram males as well.%0D%0A%0D%0AQuestion 2: If you are seeking your parents permission with regard to a permissible act, and you observe they dislike it, it will be best to abstain from that permissible act to make them happy. If you asked them permission to do something which is necessary and has to be done, then whether they are happy or not the act still has to be carried out.%0D%0A%0D%0AQuestion 3: When the child is married, then she is under the guardianship of her husband. She should consult matters with her husband.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
