  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI wanted to know the meaning of my name MUNEEZA. Someone told me that it comes from the Arabic name \"Monisa\" and someone else has told me that it comes from \"Munazza\". If my name does have an inappropriate meaning according to Islam, what should I do? Should I change my name legally? Should I just tell my family to call me from a different name? I am 20 years old right now. Is it my sin that my parents named me this? (If it is an inappropriate name)\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nI haven’t come across a name like Muneeza in Arabic. Perhaps the correct spelling is Moonisah – which means close companion or bossom friend. I suggest you request your family and acquaintances refer to you as Moonisah from now on.\n\nChanging the spelling of your name may entail a bit of difficulty. You may change the spelling if you don’t forsee any detrimental outcome, otherwise leave the spelling as it stands.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
