  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs Salaamu Alaikum Mufti,\n\nMy mother has been safe keeping my married sister's jewellery for the past few years. My sister is now in a dire financial situation and requires to sell some of her jewellery in order to by a vehicle to go to her new job.\nHowever my mother does not want to part with the jewellery because she feels my sister and her husband will squander it.\n\nMy mother acknowledges that she is not the owner of it but still does not want to part with it.\n\nZakaat has not been paid on this jewellery by either party and neither wants to pay because they each feel they are not the owners of it for obvious reasons.\n\nPlease give me some advice in this situation.\n\nAm I as a son accountable for any of their misdoings on the day of Qiyaamah ? I have tried various times to remedy the situation but it seems that my mother does not want to listen.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssal훮mu `alaikum Warahmatull훮hi Wabrakatuh,\n\nShariah has given an adult who is sane the independent right to administer his/her personal affairs.\n\nThe jewelry belongs to your sister. She has the right to use it as she wishes. It is incorrect of your mother to withhold her jewellery from her. The zakat on the jewelry is due on your sister based on her personal financial situation.\n\nIt is best to discuss the situation with your mother openly to understand her attitude and approach on the matter. That will give you more insight on the issue.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'훮la Knows Best,\n\nMuft카 Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
