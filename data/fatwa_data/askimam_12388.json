  "question": "Regarding the Hadith that the angels stop recording the names of people once the Imam ascends the stand to deliver the Friday sermon, I would like to clarify if his speech is also part of the sermon?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHere in Atlanta, the time for Dhuhr starts at 1:44pm. The Imam generally starts speaking in English from 1:15pm onwards. Then there is Azan at 1:45pm followed by the Khutbah in Arabic. Is his speech in English also considered part of the sermon? Is it mandatory to attend it?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Waajib to give the Khutba on a Friday in Arabic. It is mandatory to attend and listen to the Arabic Khutbah.\n\nThe English talk delivered before the Arabic mandatory Khutbah is not compulsory. However, it is an ideal opportunity to educate oneself and attend the English talk as well.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
