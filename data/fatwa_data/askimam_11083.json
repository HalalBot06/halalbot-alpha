  "answer": "QUESTION\nasalaamu wa alaikum, i just wanted to know as i fasted on saturday is it fard that i go to the mosque today for eid prayers and if i dont does that mean my fasting does not count, thank you asalaamu wa alikum...musa\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSalaat and fasting are two separate acts of worship. Just as it is necessary to fast, it is necessary to offer Salaat.\n\nEid Salaat is Waajib, thus, one who leaves it out would be sinful. You should try to perform all your Salaat with Jamaat in the Musjid. You will find that Allah will make all your work easy. However, if you didn?t perform Eid Salaat, your fast is still valid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
