  "question": "What is the Islamic ruling concerning what is allowed when one is engaged?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease explain in detail.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShari?ah does not recognise contemporary forms of engagements where exorbitant amounts of monies is spent on the occasion. However, the engagement is a confirmation to marry. At that stage, the boy and girl are still strangers to one another in that they cannot communicate with one another.\n\nThe premarital outings after the engagement is strictly prohibited in Shari?ah. Often, such engagements break up leaving a devastating effect on the parties and in particular, the ?used? fianc√©e.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
