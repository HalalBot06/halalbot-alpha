  "answer": "QUESTION\n1st: In my dream I saw in a market place, (kind of like the one in India, with vendors sitting on the ground) very tall sugarcanes, which seemed to be very juicy and ripe. Also there were larger than average size, light brown and ripe looking, ?Bair? (fruit common in India, not sure what the English translation is). I believe one of the vendors brought me the sugarcane peeled and cut into small pieces and promised to deliver it to my ?house? periodically. (I live in the US) 2nd.
