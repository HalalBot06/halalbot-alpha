  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI wiah to renew this question to you. i gues you have already answered it but we the people of Mauritius we just want to have an updated fatwa on your behalf. Your given fatwa was from April 2003.\n\nJazaak Allah. Here is my question.\n\nIs it permissible 4 sum1 to work in a company which sells Halal & Haram products?e.g:We r INDEPENDENT distributors of a company called Goldquest Intl Ltd,\n\nQuestion\nIs it permissible 4 sum1 to work in a company which sells Halal & Haram products?e.g:We r INDEPENDENT distributors of a company called Goldquest Intl Ltd, which sells Numismatic Products(collectors items). The products include gold/platinum coins; gold/platinum watches; holiday packages; diamonds, etc. Some products r ?permissible? (non-image based); some products r ?obscure? (they include Islamic images like the Sacred Ka`bah with obscure images of ppl around); while other products r not permissible. These products/coins hav pictures & images, including images of Jesus Christ; Hindu \"gods\"(i.e. shirk based images), etc. I work in the Network Marketing side of the business, where THE INCOME IS BASED ON THE COMMISSION OF SALES (ON ANY/ALL OF THE ABOVE PRODUCTS) & my question-Is it permissible for me to work in this business while restricting it to only purchasing, or referring other people to the 'permissible' products such as holiday packages,etc?-which they would purchase directly from the company via the Internet-(some Muslim/s may purchase an image based product without our knowledge, or a non-Muslim/s may purchase these products ?down the line? as an indirect referral of ours/customer of the company). Would some sort of restriction to 1 product like this be needed anyway?Also, would this not be like one who is working in a Super Market (& other like companies which deals with Halal and Haram products), & at times paganistic/shirk type products such as X-Mas cards, etc?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe have reviewed our Fatwa 8214, and still maintain the same position as stated therein.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
