  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI want to change my name to an Islamic name simply because I  like to be called by Islamic name. And if I change my name, I can also change the picture in my passport (which is without hijab currently). Once I change in my passport, I can change my 'non-hijab' picture in my driving license and other official places Insha Allah.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, my last name (or surname) is one of the Niyogi Brahmins surnames. Brahmin is the class of priests and preachers of Dharma in Hinduism. Niyogis are a sect of Brahmins and are predominantly Telugu speakers. Here is the reference\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niyogi#Surnames_.28Family_Names.29_of_Niyogi_Brahmins\n\nSo, my question is - can I change my last name (or surname)? Is it recommended for me to change my last name or is it forbidden? Or is it alright to have a last name (or surname) of that origin. Or should I have an Islamic surname along with my original surname? I have made Istikhara regarding changing my name. Insha Allah I will go ahead with the process once you respond regarding my last name (or surname) query. So, please help me.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nAlhamdullilah, we are very pleased to see that you wish to embed Islamic values in every aspect of your life; this is a true sign of Imaan which you perceive within you. We make dua to Allah Ta’ala that he grants you steadfastness and happiness in your life. Ameen\n\n \n\nIn principle there is no need to change ones surname, however if you feel your surname has some link with the Hindu priests, and you are looked down upon within your husbands family, then to change your surname would be desirable. Hence a better option would be in choosing your husbands surname; this would make things simpler and more acceptable for your extended family.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl.
