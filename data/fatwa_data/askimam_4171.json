  "question": "Why is the color GREEN regarded as Islamic color? Are there certain colors more preferred by the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w.s., over others? What were his preferred and disliked colors for his dress?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWithout mentioning the choice of the colour Green that is\nmedically/clinically good for the sight, etc., the colour green is the\ncolour of Jannat. Allah Ta√£la specifically speaks about the green carpets of\nparadise, etc.\n\nThe prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to wear two sheets, one for\nthe upper and the other for the lower. He did not wear trousers. He loved\nwhite and advised to wear white as well. However, it is proven that he wore\ngreen as well. Men should not wear Maroon as it is a feminine colour. Also,\nmen should avoid wearing very bright or attractive colours.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
