  "answer": "QUESTION\nBut here in USA when these occasions are near, they have sales in stores. Most of the times it is candies that have their symbols or names on them. E.g. when Valentine?s Day comes, they sell candies that says happy valentine. They are specially packed for that, because regularly these candy wrappers wouldn?t say these things. Also in stores, they put sales to attract customers by saying Halloween Special sale, Valentines Day Special sale, etc, etc. When they are on sale they are cheaper. So my question is can we buy these things just to eat because they are cheaper. And can we shop at the stores when these types of sales are on. Obviously there is no intention of celabrating that particular event. The only reason for buying those products or shopping at the stores at that time is because things are a great deal cheaper. Would it still be gunnah if we buy these things?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.  \n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.  \n\nThe sales of Halaal items during valentine, Easter, etc. with symbols of the occasion should not be viewed independently. It is not just a matter of the item itself being Halaal or not. \n\n\nThe underlying ideology of that occasion which is being promoted through the sales of sweets, candys, etc. should be considered. That is evident from the wrappings of such items which have symbols of that occasion. It is clear that the occasion of Valentines, Easter, Christmas, Halloween, etc. have no basis in Islam. To purchase items having symbols of such occasions will be assisting in promoting ideologies that are not acceptable in Shariah.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
