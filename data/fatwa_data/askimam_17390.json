  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n\n\n\nI locked my car keys in the car. I called the locksmith he charged:\n\n \nR150,00 call out charge and R80,00 to open the car which totalled R230,00.\n\n \nHowever whilst opening the car door he damaged my window tint. He told me to used the R230,00 to fix the window tint which he damaged.\n\nI felt sorry for him as he charged to nothing to open the car door, I thus told him that I would fix the window and whatever balance remained from the R230,00 I would give to him.\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n I phoned the window tinting shop and they told me it would cost R499,00 to re-tint the window.\n\n  \n\n \n\nI have decided not to re-tint the window and just live with damaged window as it would cost so much to fix. To fix the window would cost more than the locksmith charged to open the car door.\n\n \n\nDo I still owe the locksmith anything, as I told him I would fix the window and whatever amount remained from the R230,00 I would give to him?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe locksmith volitionally offered to give you the amount of R230 in exchange of the damage he caused to your window, which you accepted. Thus, you are entitled to keep that amount whether you decide to fix the window or live with the damage. You offered to return any excess amount over and above the price it would cost to fix the window; since the cost is greater than you have expected, you are not obliged to give any money back.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nMl.
