  "question": "Is it allowed to give a male name to a female?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu-alaikum Mufti saab 1) In my country(India) people give male names to females, the only difference they make is that they just add an \"a\" after the name.. Like Rizwan to Rizwana and Irfan to Irfana and Sameer to Sameera... Isn't this haram to give the names of males to females... 2) And what is the meaning of Rizwan??? If they can keep Rizwana for females then whats is the meaning of it??? Jazakallah Khair!!!!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In the Arabic language, adding a 't-aa' ('a' in English) at the end of a\nname is an indication of a female name. Example, Ridwaan is for a male, and\nRidwaana will be for a female.\n2. The meaning of Ridwaan and Ridwaana is to be happy.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
