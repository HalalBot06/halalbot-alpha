  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsSalaam Alaikum, In one of Islamic site, i have come to know that even touching or hugging a girl (not from blood relation) is a form of Zina. I was under the impresion that only intercourse is considered a Zina. Please tell me the correct thing. Now my main question is: I was suffering from severe depression attacks in the past. At time i felt that suicide would have been the cure of relieve from anxiety. I was looking for help. A non-muslim girl in my neighbourhood who got acquainted to me because she wanted some help in her studies. On seeing my condition, she decided to help me. She gave me company and started motivating me, her acts were more like that of doctor in nature towards me. It helped a lot and i recovered from some past traumatic experiences. Knowing that she was like a cure to me at a critical phase of my life, i started acknowledging her as a true friend. We had often hugged each other but our acts had never been towards getting sexual pleasure. I want to know that under such situation, have i actually done zina or a sin by touching her (hugging). How will Allah forgive me? Is there some dua which will help me come out of this sin (if at all it was there). This girl is now only in email touch with me as a friend. If i part ways with her (considering the fact that even that is a sin of being touch in email), i feel it will be a greater sin to hurt her not acknowledging the help she have given me during my bad days. Please guide me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe information on the site is correct. It is not permissible to have any contact with a non-Mahram and non-Muslim girl. Every contact with her is potentially Zinaa and is also considered as Zinaa.\n\nYou state your contact with the girl was more medical related. It is pleasing to note that you are now cured and over with your depression. It is not permissible for you to maintain contact with the girl. We advise instead of exchanging friendly emails, pass over emails with Islamic information to her. That will be a means of guidance for her and also address the issue of non-appreciation to her. If you fear that the exchanging of Islamic emails may lead to a more friendly relationship, you should kindly thank her for her assistance and stop any further contact with her. That is based on the principle on lesser of the two evils.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
