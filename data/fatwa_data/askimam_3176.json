  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it allowed to breastfeed a child after sexual intercourse or in other words what are the norms of breastfeeding. At times there are situations once the baby demands milk and there is no time for the mother to take bath or to make wuzu after a sexual intercourse. So what are the limits laid down in Isalm with regards to breast feeding.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou are aware that you need to make Ghusl after a sexual intercourse. It is\npreferable that you make Ghusl before feeding the baby but if the child\ndemands, then you should give preference to the child because Tahaarah\n(cleanliness) is not a condition for breast-feeding.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
