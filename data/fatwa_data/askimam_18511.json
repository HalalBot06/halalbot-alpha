  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nI would be very much greatfull if you could kindly tell me the definition of fatwa and its important. insyaAllah with ur sharing i will share the knowledge to my friends .\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIf we research the literal meaning of fatwa in the Hans Wehr Dictionary, we would conclude that it is to structure a formal legal opinion or a deliverance of formal legal opinions. A fatwa is a legal declaration in Islam, issued by an Islamic law expert on a specific issue. The plural of fatwa  is fataawa. Usually a fatwa is issued at the request of an individual to settle a question concerning fiqh or Islamic jurisprudence. A scholar skilled in issuing fataawa is famously known as a Mufti. Issuing of  fataawas is a great responsibility. Fatwa (Judicial verdict) holds a vital role in Islam as it helps to explain Allah Ta’ala’s law in both religious and worldly matters. The Muftis are particularly cautious when announcing fatwa’s, due to their far reaching implications and the Ulama are well aware of the importance of fatwa, thus handling it as meticulously as possible. They have researched and analyzed every discussion of Usul al-Fiqh (principles of jurisprudence), briefly or at great length, then ventured out into the field of Islamic law.\n\nThe usage of the word fatwa can be found in the Holy Quran:\n\n\n\nيَسْتَفْتُونَكَ قُلِ اللَّهُ يُفْتِيكُمْ فِي الْكَلَالَةِ\n\n“They ask thee for a legal decision. Say: Allah directs (thus) about those who leave no descendants or ascendants as heirs. “(Surah-al-Nisa verse 176)   \n\n\n\nوَيَسْتَفْتُونَكَ فِي النِّسَاءِ قُلِ اللَّهُ يُفْتِيكُمْ فِيهِنَّ وَمَا يُتْلَى عَلَيْكُمْ فِي الْكِتَابِ فِي يَتَامَى النِّسَاءِ اللَّاتِي لَا تُؤْتُونَهُنَّ مَا كُتِبَ لَهُنَّ وَتَرْغَبُونَ أَنْ تَنْكِحُوهُنَّ وَالْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ الْوِلْدَانِ وَأَنْ تَقُومُوا لِلْيَتَامَى بِالْقِسْطِ وَمَا تَفْعَلُوا مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِهِ عَلِيمًا\n\n“They ask you about women. Say, ―Allah answers you about them, and so does what is recited to you from the Book regarding orphaned women whom you do not give what is prescribed for them and tend to marry them, and regarding the weak from the children, and that you should maintain justice for the orphans. Whatever good you do Allah is aware of it. (Surah-al-nisa verse 127)\n\n \n\nTo issue a Shari ruling is a great responsibility and requires sacrifice, piety and great trustworthiness. Prior to Hazrat Umar (Radiallahu Anhu) issuing a ruling, he would gather the prominent sahaba and consult with them first, then would he issue the ruling having placed full trust on Allah Ta’ala.\n\n \n\nDar-ul-Iftah is the fatwa institution. Another definition of fatwa is the Shariah’ law illustrated by a Mufti to an inquirer in a non-restrictive form. Hence, the inquirer is not restricted or bound by the law arising from the Mufti’s fatwa. The inquirer has the right to seek a fatwa from another Mufti or Muftis. Furthermore, he can apply the Fatwa from another Mufti, provided the Mufti is an ‘Alim or pious person and well qualified to issue rulings.\n\n\nA Mufti is required to be academically honest. He should not discriminate against people when issuing a fatwa, for example by issuing a different fatwa for family members and the public. Fatwa, however, is an integral aspect of ibadah, so a Mufti can issue fatwas relating to cleanliness, salaat, zakat and other ibadaat.\n\n\n\n\nRasullullah (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) himself issued fatwa’s throughout his life. There is a rasaa’il (scripture) called Rasaa’il Muhammadiyah wherein, during the era of Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) people used to bring their personal issues and a ruling would be given to them.\n\n\nA Mufti should be a pious person who is an expert in the field of Jurisprudence. He is also expected to analyze and research past fatwa’s as well as make reasonable choices. He should not be content with only extracting and narrating fatwa’s from other Muftis. Fataawa differ from one Mufti to another, depending on the academic level of the Mufti. Consequently, a person who wishes to obtain a fatwa should  base his selection on the level of mastery and piety of the Mufti.\n\n\n\nA Mufti who makes a fatwa founded on rumours and instincts will become a sinner and his action is haram. Such a Mufti is sinful because of his blatant lie towards Allah Ta’ala and Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam). In a hadith Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alaihi  Wasallam) said: “Anyone who issues a fatwa without knowledge, will bear the sin of issuing the fatwa.”\n\n\nIn conclusion, issuing of rulings is a mammoth task and requires great determination and excellence in the field of Jurisprudence.\n\n \n\nWe hope this symposium gives you brief insight and clarity on the topic of Fatwaas.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl.
