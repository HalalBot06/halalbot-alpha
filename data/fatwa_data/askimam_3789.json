  "question": "I am having problem in naming my child,My parents want to name my wife want to name her child I have no problem in naming,Who has the rights in Islam to name the child ,mother or grand parents",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn Islam, the prerogative of naming the child lies with the parents. If a\nfather and mother disagree on a name, then the father has the right to name\nthe child. (Bringing up Children in Islam by Ml. Habibullah Mukhtaar pg.30)\n\nIn your particular instance, you have waived your right, hence, your wife\n(i.e. mother of the child) is more rightful in naming the child.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
