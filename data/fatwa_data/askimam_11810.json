  "question": "Hijab, Hizbut Tahreer & Photograph",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamoalikum 1.Please let me know about the correct meaning of HIJAB. Some people here are of the view that hijab does not include face of the woman. They are of the view that it was only compulsory for the wives of Prophet (SAW). Please explain in the light of Quran & Hadith. 2.What is your view regarding ?Hizb-ut-Tahreer?? Is this organization have the right beliefs regarding ?Khilafat?. 3. Is taking a picture of living being is allowed in Islam? What is meant by living being?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The proper definition of Hijaab can be understood from the following verse of the noble Qur?aan, ?O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies. That would be better that they should be known so as not to be annoyed.? Imaam Qurtubi has mentioned the explanation of ?cloaks? given by Abdullah ibn Mas?ood [Radhiallaahu anhu] in his famous Tafseer ?Al-Jaami li bayanil Qur?aan?. Abdullah ibn Mas?ood [Radhiallaahu anhu] states that the cloaks should be tied or wound in such a way that only one eye remains exposed or another method would be to tie the upper portion on the brow just above the eyes and another portion above the nose just below the eyes, leaving only the two eyes exposed. (vol.14 pg.232; Darul hadith-Cairo). It is not permissible for a young man to expose her face in the presence of non-Mahram men. (Shaami vol.1 pg.406; HM Saeed)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Although the aim of this group is praiseworthy, that being in their effort to reestabish the Khilaafah, the means they have adopted are somewhat questionable. Their aim is to re-establish Khilaafah mainly through political channels and efforts and loss towards the education and rectification and revival of the Muslims. Such resources could be more properly channelled and produce better results.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Allamah ibn Abideen in Raddul Muhtar has quoted Imaam Nawawi from his Sharh of Sahih Muslim that under all circumstances, it is Haraam to make pictures (of living beings), because in it there is resemblance to the creation of Allah. (vol.1 pg.648). A living being is defined as that which has rooh (soul), for example, human, animals, etc. Trees and mountains, etc. are considered as inanimate objects.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
