  "answer": "QUESTION\nShaykh Taner Ansari says : MATURE A CTIONS?GOOD ADAB :That is why our actions have to be mature, so that we can stay in the presence of Allah. These things have happened before. Angels were in the presence of Allah. Shaytan was in the presence of Allah.Adam was in the presence of Allah. They all proved that they didn?t have the adab to be in His presence. Adab means good manners. So Allah kicked them all out. That?s why we?re here.This time around Allah does not want everybody in His presence. Allah wants only those who deserve and can handle it to be in His presence. In His presence you cannot think about anything other than Allah. In His presence you should always know you?re here now. As your Shaykh, I want all your focus to be with me. I don?t want you wandering around here and there in your mind. If you?re not paying attention to me, then you are insulting me. It is the same thing with Allah. That?s why the Shaykh is the first test from Allah. The importance of your Shaykh is that you learn how to be with the Shaykh. Once you learn how to be with the Shaykh, then you are safe to be with Allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe do not know Shaykh Taner Ansari.\n\nAccording to the details of your query, it is clear that his discourse is based on spiritual upliftment. We are also not able to comment on the statements attributed to the Shaykh as that may not be verbatim. It may be your understanding of what the Shaykh said.\n\nNevertheless, it is important that a Shaykh of Tareeqat be an Aalim of Deen, he should be adhering to the Shari?ah and Sunnah of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. His entire life should be revolving around Taqwa and piety.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
