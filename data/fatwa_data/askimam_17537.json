  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy wife got very law sexual desire. I want to have intimacy evry other day or after week, she doesn't let me even touch her. I fill very bad and then I don't know what to do. Is there any sin when wife reject her husband. Can you please explain to me about this situation.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIntimate relation is a mutual issue between the spouses. Apart from the wife fulfilling her marital obligations, it is important that the husband takes the feelings, tempo etc. of the wife into consideration before becoming upset. By the husband forcing the issue upon the wife, sometimes it could create estrangement in the marriage. Instead of the husband worrying about the sin of refusing him his marital right, rather talk to her and enquire if she experiences any difficulty in doing so. By the husband forcing the issue upon the wife, she will eventually feel used for this purpose and become de moralized which could possibly ruin the marriage and complicate matters further.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
