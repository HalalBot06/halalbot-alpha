Under this relationship, the Customer is an Investor (Rab ul Mal), and the Bank is the Manager (Mudarib) of the funds deposited by the customers.\n\n \n\n \n\nThe bank allocates the funds received from the customers to a deposit pool.

Profit is distributed at the Gross Income level shared between the Bank (Mudarib) and customers (Rab ul Mal) on the basis of a pre-determined profit sharing ratio, based on their respective category/tiers, announced at the beginning of the period. The Banks profit sharing ratio is 80% of Gross Income and Depositors profit sharing ratio is 20% of Gross Income, calculated after deducting costs and expenses directly incurred in deriving that Income.\n\n \n\n \n\nAt the end of the month, the Bank may unilaterally reduce its profit sharing ratio for the benefit of depositors.\n\n \n\n \n\nIn case of a loss, as per the rules of Mudarabah, the deposit pool shall bear the loss in the ratios of investment of depositors.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHow to Invest in Riba Free COII\nRiba-Free COII is available at all branches of Meezan Bank Ltd.
