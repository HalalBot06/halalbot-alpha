  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have been married for 3 year i did not get along with my wife. I had given her 1 talaaq already then 1 day we had a problem in the family i said to my wife if your sister gets married at such and such date then i you will be divorced automatically i said this 5-6 times and had intention in my heart that it is going to be over between me and her. Can you please tell me if the nikah is still valid.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf the sister got married on the specified date, the Talaaq will fall. (Hidaaya vol.2 pg.385; Pakistan)\n\nThis will be the second divorce as you gave her once before. You should be careful as the third Talaaq will completely terminate the Nikah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
