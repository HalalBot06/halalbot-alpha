  "answer": "QUESTION\na women while preforming salat was reading from the quran while following the imam in the masjid, does reading from quran while in salat break the salat when maliki asr has started and hanifi zohr has not ended can maliki pray zohr in the hanifi time rather than doing kaza of zohr of that day\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. According to the Hanafi Madhab, it is not permissible to recite any portion of the Qur?aan behind the Imaam in Qiyaam (standing posture)\n2. If a person did not perform Dhuhr Salaat during Misl Awwal (when shadow is equivalent to an item), then the person has to perform thereafter. According to the Hanafi Madhab, that will be Adaa (Salat performed on time).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
