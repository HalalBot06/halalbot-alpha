  "question": "dream of eggs",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy Father dreamt about white eggs, normal white eggs, there were so many white eggs, does it mean anything?\nMy Mother wanted to know if one soul meets the other soul in heaven? for e.g. Will my uncle meet his mother in heaven? (both deceased, both very pious and religious, Allahmdulillah), and i am not talking about the day of Judgement, but now.\nAnd my younger brother dreamt that he is drinking a lot of water, and no matter how much he drinks the water does not quench his thirst, does it mean anything?\n\nThis is the 3rd or 4th time i am sending you these questions, hopefully i will be answered this time, and for all the previous answers to my questions are highly appreciated, JazakAllah.\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYou have enquired about a few dreams. The Qur’aan and Ahaadith of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] have directions about dreams. However, this does not mean that one only focuses on dreams. Dreams are like the different scenesof a journey. The scenes are not the ultimate purpose of the travel. Similarly, dreams makes one happy but that should not be regarded as one’s objective in life.\n\nAlhamdulillah, the dreams you have enquired have positive signs. The dream of death is a reminder to us be conscious of death and prepare for it by being obedient to Allah according to the way of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and his Sahaba [radhiallaahu anhum].\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
