  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a very important question regarding namaz and istehaza.IÂ  am not a patient of istehaza but nearly 2 times it happened that menses period started and after 2 days stopped.and then started after 3 days .Is this isthehaza.and should i had to pray namaz in the interval between.One more time it happened that menses started and just came during the time of one salah and then stopped and came after 2 or 3 days.\n\nWhat is the fatwa for this situstion about praying namaz,was this menses or isthehaza.please eloborate\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nKindly take note of the following basic rules:\n\n1. The bleeding of a woman after puberty is Haydh;\n\n2. The minimum period of haydh is 3 days;\n\n3. The maximum period of haydh is 10 days;\n\n4. It is not necessary that the bleeding be continuous;\n\n5. The bleeding after 10 days is Istihaadha.\n\nIn view of the above, if you bled for two days and then bled on the fifth day, then all those days will be regarded as haydh. It is not permissible to perform Salaat during haydh. It is compulsory to perform Salaat during Istihaadha. For that, a fresh Wudhu must be made during each Salaat time.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
