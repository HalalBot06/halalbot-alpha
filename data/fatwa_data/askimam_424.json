  "question": "I would like to know what is the significance of Fateha, not the SurahFaatiha but the one that is read after Yaaseen or wne someone passes away.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nUpon the death of a person, it is a common practice to make Fateha.%0D%0AContextually, Fateha is the recitation of a few Aayaats of the Qur'aan%0D%0Afollowed by a Du'aa for the deceased.%0D%0A%0D%0AThere are innumerable number of Ahaadith expounding the virtues of reciting%0D%0Athe Qur'aan and making Du'aa. There are also many Ahaadith on Isaal-e-Sawaab%0D%0A(sending reward to the deceased). Surely, the deceased eagerly await for%0D%0Arewards from his beloved wife, parents and friends by them making Du'aa for%0D%0Ahis forgiveness, giving charity, etc. on his behalf.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, in order for the deceased to benefit from the gifts of his beloved,%0D%0Athey must be channelled to him in the correct way, the way of our beloved%0D%0AProphet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). During the time of the Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), many deaths occurred. It was his noble habit%0D%0Ato comfort the bereaved families and widows. Many Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhu) enquired from the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) about%0D%0AIsaal-e-Sawaab (sending Sawaab to their deceased). It is not proven on any%0D%0Aone occasion that the Prophet himself practised or ordered the customary%0D%0Apractise of Fateha. Had the customary practise of Fateha been of any%0D%0Asignificance, he surely would have at least practised it or ordered its%0D%0Apractise at least once in his lifetime.%0D%0A%0D%0ATo emphasise and carry out a particular practise not proven in Shari'ah, for%0D%0Aexample, Fateha leads to distortion of Deen. Many people may regard the%0D%0Apractise as necessary and an integral part of Deen as is the case among many%0D%0Aunwary people today. Any practise which leads to a possible distortion of%0D%0ADeen is prohibited and a major sin. Obviously, such a practise leading to%0D%0Asin invokes the anger of Allah. How can such a practise benefit the%0D%0Adeceased?%0D%0A%0D%0AThe only way to benefit the deceased is to send Sawaab to him by carrying%0D%0Aout acts of virtue, for example, reciting Qur'aan, making Du'aa for him,%0D%0Agiving charity, etc. as advised by our beloved Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam). May Allah Ta'ala bless all our Marhooms and grant them Jannatul%0D%0AFirdaws.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta%E3la Knows Best.%0D%0A%0D%0AWas salaam%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0A"
