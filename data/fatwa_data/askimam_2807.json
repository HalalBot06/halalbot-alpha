  "answer": "QUESTION\nA british girl asked me these questions. I do not have the knowledge required so I'm asking you. Please keep in mind while answering that I'll foreward this to her. Jazakallah,\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWisdom of Allah Ta'ala%0D%0A%0D%0ABi-ismihi Ta'ala%0D%0A%0D%0A1) Before coming to the actual question, it is necessary to clarify a%0D%0Aglaring error in the question.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe questioner has assumed that adversities such as famine have been created%0D%0Aby some other being, and poses the question of why Allah Ta'ala does not%0D%0Aassist against this so called other being.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis is based on a false notion. Allah Ta'ala is the sole creator of all%0D%0Aconditions, good and bad. Hence Allah Ta'ala is the creator of the%0D%0Acalamities in which the creation find themselves. It would then be absurd to%0D%0Aask why Allah Ta'ala does not assist against Himself, for He Himself is the%0D%0ACreator of the very condition against which He is supposed to assist.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis then leads to another question, of why Allah Ta'ala creates such calamities.%0D%0A%0D%0ATo understand this, we need to recognise who Allah Ta'ala is. Allah Ta'ala%0D%0Ais the sole creator of the entire universe and all contained therein. He is%0D%0Aalone and has no partners. He is independent and is not answerable to%0D%0Aanyone. He does as He pleases. He is also the sole owner and master of all%0D%0Acreation. Hence it is His prerogative to deal with His creation and property%0D%0Aas He deems fit. We as His creation have no right to question His actions.%0D%0A%0D%0AEven in this world we regard it as unjust to question a man as to why he%0D%0Aspent his personal wealth in a certain avenue, and not other. What then%0D%0Aabout the absolute owner of everything, Allah Ta'ala. Surely He has the%0D%0Aabsolute right to deal with His property as he deems fit.%0D%0A%0D%0AFurthermore, Allah Ta'ala is All-Wise. He is free from all faults and%0D%0Aunblemished. His actions are never devoid of wisdom. Hence He has a define%0D%0Areason for putting His creation into such adversities. Allah Ta'ala says in%0D%0Athe Qur%E1an: \"He is the One who created life and death in order to test you,%0D%0Athat who amongst you are the best in action.\" The purpose of life and death%0D%0Ais a trail and test. Allah Ta'ala tests man through various agencies, both%0D%0Athrough adversity and prosperity. Allah Ta'ala wishes to see how His servant%0D%0Awill respond to these various circumstances. Will he remain an obedient%0D%0Aservant or will he renegade on his allegiance? Allah Ta'ala wishes to reward%0D%0AHis sincere servants with the eternal bliss of Jannah (Paradise). For this%0D%0Aman has to prove his unflinching devotion to Allah Ta'ala. It is to test%0D%0Athis devotion that Allah Ta'ala imposes trails upon mankind.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe find an example of this in this very world. If scientists wish to send an%0D%0Aastronaut into space, they select the very fittest, one able to endure the%0D%0Arigours of life in space. In order to determine the eligibility of a%0D%0Aprospective astronaut, he is put under various rigorous trails. He is%0D%0Adeprived of sleep, food and drink for days, is subject to gruelling physical%0D%0Aexercises, separated from family and kin for months, laden with tons of%0D%0Atechnical information which he has to memorise, and no stone is left%0D%0Aunturned in taking his physical, mental, and emotional faculties to the%0D%0Alimits. If an observer were unaware of the mission for which this astronaut%0D%0Ais being prepared, he would no doubt, on face value, regard these trails as%0D%0Acruel and harsh. He would declare the scientist to be tormentors and%0D%0Aoppressors. Little does he know that the astronaut takes great joy and pride%0D%0Ain enduring these trails.%0D%0A%0D%0ASimilar are the trails of this world which Allah Ta'ala imposes on his%0D%0Aservants. Allah Ta'ala wishes that they qualify for the eternal success of%0D%0AParadise. The sincere servant too takes great joy in enduring these trails%0D%0Ain exchange for the gift of eternal bliss.%0D%0A%0D%0AMoreover, Allah Ta'ala out of His mercy does not impose a trail on his%0D%0Aservant which the servant cannot bear. He the All Mighty says in the Holy%0D%0AQur%E1an: \"Allah Ta'ala does not make a person responsible except for that%0D%0Awhich is within his ability.\" Thus in all these trails the servant is only%0D%0Aexpected to do that which is within his volition. He is not accountable for%0D%0Afactors beyond his control. Hence, despite the right of Allah Ta'ala to%0D%0Aimpose whatever trail He wishes upon us by virtue of He being our owner and%0D%0Amaster, out of His mercy he only holds us responsible for that which we can%0D%0Aendure.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe can thus understand that all adversities, famine, death or any other,%0D%0Ahave a definite purpose, i.e. to trail the eligibility of man to the eternal%0D%0Alife of prosperity in the hereafter.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Allah Ta'ala is neither man, nor spirit. Spirit implies a being confined%0D%0Ato time and space. Allah Ta'ala is all perfect, and free from time or space.%0D%0AHis physical being is incomprehensible to us.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe trust this answers your questions.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
