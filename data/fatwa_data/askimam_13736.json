  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nyou stated in a recent answer that once impurity dries then it is not considered to transfer to other places unless its smell or colour etc is noticed on the other thing. Does this ruling apply even if the object becomes wet after becoming dry. E.g a cloth has impurity on it but dries and thereafter at a later time becomes wet againg through some water etc .\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nOnce an impurity dries up, it does not transfer to other places. However, if the cloth has ayn Najasah (Najasah in itself, not mixed with anything else), then once it becomes wet, if it becomes apparent on the dry, then the cloth becomes impure.\n\nIf the impurity is not ayn, e.g. some impurity fell into a container of water making all the water impure, then there are two opinions:\n\n1. If the dry cloth becomes so wet that by squeezing it the impurity will drop, then the dry cloth will also become impure.\n\n2. Even though the dry cloth does not drip of impurity, but it transfers to the dry cloth, then too will the dry cloth become impure, i.e. will be preferred and more cautious to follow second opinion.
