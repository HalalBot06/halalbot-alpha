  "answer": "QUESTION\nI travel to university everyday, the university is about 55 miles away from my house, is it allowed for me to join my prayers, and if so, then how do I pray them i.e. how many rakats, also if you go to sleep and then wake up for namaaz do you have to do istanja or only just wudu.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. According to the Hanafi Madhab, it is not allowed to join two Salaats in one Salaat time. However, if there is difficulty then Shari?ah allows for apparent joining of Salaats, i.e. delaying Dhuhr Salaat to its last time and performing Asr Salaat in its first time. (Shaami vol.1 pg.381)\n\n2. If you are Musaafir, you should perform Qasr Salaat, i.e. perform 2 Rakaats instead of 4 in Dhuhr, Asr and Esha. While at home, you should perform full 4 Rakaats.\n\n3. It is not necessary to do Istinjaa when waking up.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
