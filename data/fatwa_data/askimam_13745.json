  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI, with my few friends, committed sodomy for a few times. It started when I was not mature and I matured during the time...We did it for just pleasure; At that time, I knew it was a sin, but never knew that it is such a big sin. At that time, I hardly used to go for Jumma prayers.... but Alhamdu Lillah, I have repented from this and left the bat habbit long ago; I now pray five times a day, recite Quran daily and also take classes of \"Tajweed-e-Quran\" and Mas'ail.... It was during Quran's tafseer that I knew of this sin as one of the most hated by Allah and I heard of its punishment... Now i want to know what should I do?... I am really confused since I have heard of the punishment for a person commiting sodomy... Please reply in as much detail as possible... Jazak Allah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nSodomy is a major sin and could be punishable by death. You have made tawbah and stopped the bad and evil habit. Insha Allah, you will be forgiven as you are sincere and do not indulge in that filthy habit any more.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
