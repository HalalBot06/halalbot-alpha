  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI wanted to ask if it is ok to masturbate while talking to my wife on the phone if she is gone to her parents and i have the sexual urge. I watch no tv , use software to block pictures from internet, no magazines or any such thing that would deliberately cause me to get arouse.\n\nIm from Pakistan and happen to visit the majalis of hazrat wala Hakeem Muhammad Akhtar sahib D.B every week ALHAMDOLILAH , i don't have an islahi taluk as yet and im afraid to ask such a question right now. I'll be happy if this question is treated privately and not displayed publicly.\n\nThe question again is that my wife sometimes go to her house which is in other city and im studying right now where the enviroment is filthy and must be the reason for my urge. I never happen to gaze on a non mahram in  university ALHAMDOLILAH but i still not that the surrounding effects me . I left masturbating , repented and promised not to commit it ever . I even hate it but i don't know what to do in this circumstances . Please help me .\n\nJAZAKALLAH .\n\np.s i love this website :) MAY ALLAH GUIDE US ALL.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is not permissible to do so. Be patient until your wife returns. If you cannot exercise patience, then fast to suppress your desire. You should not feel ashamed and discuss your dilemma with Hazrath Hakeem Muhammad Saheb Madda Zilluhu.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
