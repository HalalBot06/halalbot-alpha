Is she also in the same category of Zina as a woman who atually goes out and commits Zina?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n Assalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\n1) Allah Ta’ala says in the Quran regarding the husband and wife:\n\nهن لباس لكم و انتم لباس لهن\n\n“They (wives) are clothing for you and you (husbands) are clothing for them” (2:187)\n\nA person cannot keep away from clothing. Similarly, a husband and wife are unable to forbear the lack of each other's company brought about by marriage. This includes the act of fulfilling one’s desires with one’s spouse in a permissible manner. Masturbation and looking at non-Mehram women are strictly forbidden in Shari’ah. We acknowledge the fact that you realize these are evil acts and are trying to overcome your desires Alhamdulillah. This is a positive first step to overcome this evil habit. In order to overcome these desires, one who is married should fulfill their desires in a permissible manner. In case of the absence of the spouse, one should fast if he feels he will be affected by his desires. This was the advice of our beloved Messenger (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam). Another act one can do to overcome his desires is to constantly do zikr by repeating the name of Allah as much as possible. One would surely not perform these acts in front of any respectable person. Allah Ta’ala is the Lord of the worlds and is the All-Knowing and All-Seeing. With that in mind, a true believer surely would not commit such acts when he is conscious that Allah Ta’ala is watching him.\n\nIt is also necessary to make sincere tawbah and istighfaar and to make a firm commitment to Allah Ta’ala that one will endeavor to stop this habit. When one realizes a sin is being committed and sincerely repents and makes an effort to stop, Allah Ta’ala surely is the Most-Forgiving and Most-Merciful.\n\nHereunder is a detailed booklet entitled “Masturbation, A Disastrous Problem Faced by the Youth”:\n\nhttp://www.al-inaam.com/Books/Masturbation.pdf\n\n \n\n \n\n2) It is strictly impermissible in Shari’ah to be in any form of contact with a non-Mehram. This also includes chatting over the internet. These acts are minor forms of zina, which may eventually lead to zina itself if they are not stopped. Allah Ta’ala warns us in the Quran by saying:\n\nولا تقربوا الزنا إنه كان فاحشة وساء سبيلا\n\n“Do not even go close to fornication. It is indeed a shameful act and an evil way to follow” (17:32)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\nMl.
