  "question": "Assalamu-alaikum mufti saheb. If you could please interpret this dream for me",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI had a dream in which I was leaving the masjid with my wife. Since I had parked far I was going to get the car and pick up my wife. As I was walking towards my car, my father called to me and said to do zabiha of a goat before I leave. So I returned whereupon my wife approached me carrying a baby goat in her arms. When she placed the goat on the ground my father came and pointed to me the spot where I should cut. Before I could cut I looked down and the goat had changed into a human child. I had tears in my eyes but my father told me to continue to cut it. When I cut the neck of the child no blood came out, and it turned out that the child had died before I cut him and that is why there was no blood. (Its like the opposite of the story of Ibrahim (AS) with Ismail (AS)). Please if you could interpret. Jazhakallahu Khair p.s. Do you know mufti Rafiq Ahmed from Dakkah Bangladesh?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream is an indication of sacrificing your Nafs and making Islaah\n(reformation and spiritual upliftment).\n\nWe do not know Mufti Rafiq Ahmed from Dakkah, Bangladesh.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
