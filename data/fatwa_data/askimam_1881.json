  "question": "Please can you tell me when a couple may consider their family to be \"complete\".",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy husband is happy with our two children at the moment. However I would like to have least one more but would it be wrong to go against his wishes? I think his concern is partly based on the state of my health after birth which left me with permanent health conditions which are likely to worsen. Also as I married late, my age may need to be considered in terms of risk.Would Istikaarah be appropriate in this case? May Allah reward you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shariah, since your previous pregnancy and birth\nexperiences have affected your health and is likely to worsen, you may adopt\na temporary contraceptive method. Despite your ill health, should you wish\nto have another child, you should discuss the matter with your husband and\nmutually decide to follow the outcome of istikhaarah.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
