  "answer": "QUESTION\nBetween one of my Non-muslim friend and myself discussion came up about Re-Birth. I told my point of view according to Islamic Faith. But he started giving some real time examples including recently happened one's in which a few years old child tells his previous where-abouts and when checked people found it true. I couldn't answer him back. Please inform me what should I tell him.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe concept of rebirth in Islam is baseless. Quite often, people are trained to merely propagate their incorrect beliefs. Unfortunately, their incorrect propagation leads them to believe they are true. To discuss with such people is an exercise in futility. It may also be detrimental as it is possible that a sincere person could be wrongly influenced by the convincing methods of a deviated person.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
