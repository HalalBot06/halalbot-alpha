  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu'alaikum, Is it possible to get the Arabic of these duaas or please refer to the surah and aayah if they have been taken from the Qura'n. I don't want to make any mistake while reading them. Dua Before Studying \"Allahumma infa'nii bimaa 'allamtanii wa'allimnii maa yanfa'uunii. Allahumma inii as'aluka fahmal-nabiyyen wa hifzal mursaleen al-muqarrabeen. Allahumma ijal leesanee 'aiman bi dhikrika wa qalbi bi khashyatika. Innaka 'ala ma-tasha'u qadeer wa anta hasbun-allahu wa na'mal wakeel.\" Dua After Studying \"Allahumma inni astaodeeka ma qara'tu wama hafaz-tu. Farudduhu 'allaya inda hajati elahi. Innaka 'ala ma-tasha'-u qadeer wa anta hasbeeya wa na'mal wakeel\" Dua While Studying Something Difficult \"Allahumma la sahla illama ja-'altahu sahla anta taj 'alu al hazana eza ma shi'ta sahal.\" Dua For Concentration \"Salla-l-laahu alaa Muhammad wa aal-e Muhammad. Allahumma inni as'aluka yaa mudhakkira-l khayr wa faa'ilahu wa-l-aamimira bihi dhakir-ni maa ansaani-hi-shaytan.\" May Allah be pleased with you and grant you thawab for your great effort. JazakAllah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe have checked the transliteration of the Du?aas and approve of them.
