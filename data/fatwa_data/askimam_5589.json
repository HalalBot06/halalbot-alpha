  "question": "I once went for Salaat at a Masjid with a group and found that there is still lot of time left for the Jamaat. Since we were in a rush, I lead the prayer with the group with me. Is this not right?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe Imaam confronted me right after I finished the Salaat, and told me that since I have performed the Salaat on the main Musallah (where the Imaam normally leads), a second Jamaat (which is the regular Jamaat) cannot take place from this spot anymore. Is there such a restriction? Please explain.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, for a second Jamaat to be performed there are different%0D%0Asituations. The rulings for each situation will be different. Hereunder are%0D%0Athe different situations:%0D%0Aa) The Musjid is structured solely for travelers%0D%0Ab) The Musjid does not have an appointed Imaam and Muazzin%0D%0Ac) The first Jamaat was performed by non-residents of the community%0D%0Ad) The first Jamaat was performed by residents of the community. However,%0D%0Athe Jamaat was performed without calling out the Adhaan.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe ruling for the above four situations is that it will be permissible to%0D%0Aperform the second Jamaat with Adhaan and Iqaamat.%0D%0Aa) The resident of the locality called out the Adhaan for the first Jamaat.%0D%0Ab) The first Jamaat was performed exactly like the normal Jamaat, i.e. from%0D%0Athe front, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the above 2 situations to perform the second Jamaat is Makrooh Tahrimi.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf we analyse the above situations, the scenario which was explained falls%0D%0Aunder the category 'C' where non-residents of the community performed the%0D%0Afirst Jamaat. Therefore, it is better if the second Jamaat be performed from%0D%0Athe official Musallah.%0D%0A%0D%0ALastly, we advise that if Salaat has to be performed before the stipulated%0D%0Atime of Jamaat, it be performed in the Sahn (outer section) of the Masjid.%0D%0AOtherwise, perform in one corner of the Musjid, not at the place of the%0D%0AImaam.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
