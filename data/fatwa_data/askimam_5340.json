  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaam Alaikum wa ratullahi wa baraktauh, Dear Imam, I would be very grateful if you could interpret my dream. First though, Last night I prayed during the night and ask Allah SWT to give me a dream that would tell me if I should anticipate a proposal from a man my father met last week. Last night I dreamed that I was breastfeeding a baby. Please tell me if this has any significance to my dua and if it does please tell me what it means. If it does not, I would still be very grateful if you could interpret it anyway. May Allah reward you for you efforts. Aammen.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIstikhaara literally means to seek good.\n\n1. The purpose of Istikhaara is to seek the guidance of Allah whether a\nmatter is good or not, for example, a girl receives a proposal of marriage\nand is unsure whether she should accept the proposal or not. Istikhaara is\nnot made to merely determine anticipation of a proposal.\n2. Breastfeeding indicates Barakah and blessing.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
