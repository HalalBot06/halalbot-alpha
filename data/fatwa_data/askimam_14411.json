  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know the permissability of using a certain medication which is prescribed for my pancreas problem\n\nSince I was 14 years old I have had a condition called pancreatitis. This condition is where the pancreas swells & produces too much pancreatic juice with severe pain. The pancreas produces enzymes which help break down the food in the stomach. The reason for my problem is unknown & the doctor has put the condition down as being a genetic defect. Over the past 2 months my pancreas has been troubling on & off. About 2 weeks ago I started having pain in the bladder & right kidney. I went to a doctor who sent me for X-rays of the kidneys. On the scan it showed that there is a stone in the pancreas. I took the X-rays to the specialist who has been treating me for my pancreas condition who told me that the function of my pancreas has decreased significantly which explains my lack of energy due to the fact that my food is not breaking down properly & my stomach not working properly when I go to the toilet. This is also causing my pancreas to overwork causing some pain. The reason for my communication with you is that the medication that will help break down the food in my stomach & help to reduce the work load on my pancreas contains pig fat & there are no other medicines available on the market that are specifically designed to help my pancreas. I would like to know if I am allowed to take this medication.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the absence of Halaal medicine, it is permissible to use the non-Halaal medicine which contain pig fat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
