  "question": "I am an 18 year old girl planning to get married.I have performed Istikhaara,I would like to know what it means.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThere is my father's friend's son to whom my parents are planning to get me married to.I have performed istikhaara,on that night I had a peaceful sleep and the next day I was totally inclined to marry him. But the day after I had a dream that his father is quite surprised by our sending the proposal and say that they are planning to get him married later and the boy is seen as saying that he does not want to marry Mr.x's (thats my father's) daughter and later his father says that he would convince him. What does all this mean? I am still inclined to marry him as he is a very good boy.Is this dream a real indication from Allaah,or is it just some own thoughts as the day I performed the Istikhaara I was quite peaceful and inclined to marry him and even now my mind says he would keep me happy. Should I proceed with the proposal or forget him.His father is my father's very close friend and we like their family. Please give me proper guidance according to sunnah,as I am totally confused. Jazakallaah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe advise that you continue with the Istikhaara.\n\nIf there appears no new strong and clear indication that you should not\nmarry this person, you may go ahead and marry him. Do not let dreams play\nhavoc with your mind. Very often dreams have a different meaning from their\napparent impression. If you are inclined to marry this person, and there are\nno negative points about him, then go ahead.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
