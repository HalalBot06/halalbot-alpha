  "answer": "QUESTION\n1-I just wanted to know if any kind of Hadith related the science or any sahaba(R.A) or person asking about the sun star and making of earth and universe to Muhammad (salalahu alhay wasallam) and wanted to know or taking interest to gain knowledge of something like study of science. 2- Is there any hadith or ayah where ALLAH(swt) promise to protect Khana-e-kaba. 3- What is your opinion about this web site www.interviewwithgod.net is it good to forward to ppl., many muslims doing this practice now a days. Jazakallahu Khairun\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) There are numerous Quraanic verses and Ahadith encouraging man to ponder%0D%0Aover the creation of the universe, the sky,the earth, the sun and moon etc.%0D%0Afrom these Divine Texts we come to realise the virtue and value of pondering%0D%0Aand studying these natural elements. The intention should solely be to%0D%0Arecognise the greatness, grandeur and splendour of one's Creator and how He%0D%0Ahas created all these heavenly bodies in perfection alone and by means of%0D%0Athis to gain the proximity of Allah Ta'ala. One should not become so%0D%0Aengrossed in studying these phenomena that he begins to forget his%0D%0Aprioreties in Deen and also to study these sciences in the light of the Holy%0D%0AQuraan and Ahadith. Allah Ta'ala mentions in the 4th chapter of the holy%0D%0AQuraan in Surah Aal-e-Imraan, verse no.190: Verily, in the creation of the%0D%0Askies and the earth and in the alternating of the night and the day are%0D%0Atruly signs for those of intelligence.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn Al-Jaamius Sagheer of Allamah Suyuti a hadith is mentioned: Ponder over%0D%0Athe creation...%0D%0A%0D%0AIt has been reported from a few Sahaba radiyallahu anhum that nabi alaihis%0D%0Asalaam approached then and so they kept silent and he asked them: \"What were%0D%0Ayou people speakin about?\". They replied: \"We looked at the sun and we were%0D%0Apondering over it that where did it come from and to where does it go and%0D%0Aand we pondered over the creation of Allah\". So, he said: \" Continue to do%0D%0Aso in the same manner, ponder over the creation of Allah but donot ponder%0D%0Aover the being of Allah ...(Refer to Ad-durrul Mansoor Surah An-najm, verse%0D%0Ano. 42-47)%0D%0A%0D%0A2) We find in the treasure of Ahadith that nabi alaihis salaam once said%0D%0Athat: \"Make tawaaf of the ka'bah in abundance before it is lifted up and the%0D%0Apeople will forget its original place. Nabi alaihis salaam also said: Take%0D%0Amaximum benefit from the Ka'bah because it was destroyed twice before and on%0D%0Athe third occassion it will be raised up. In many Ahadith we find that the%0D%0AKa'abah will remain intact till the time just before Qiyamat. (Ad-durrul%0D%0AMansoor%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi alaihis salaam said: Those with smallweak shins from Abyssinia will%0D%0Adestroy the Ka'abah. It is recorded in Fathul Bari that this will occur%0D%0Aprior to Qiyanat when there will be no soul to utter the name of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0A3) Allah Ta'la states in the Holy Quraan: He has not made Deen as a burden%0D%0Aupon you. Nabi alaihis salaam mentions: Certainly, Deen is easy. The Deen of%0D%0AIslaam comprises of the Quraan and the Sunnat. These two jewels are%0D%0Asufficient for our salvation in both the worlds and the beauty of Islaam is%0D%0Aits easiness and practicality. If we donot understand a ceratin aspect, then%0D%0Athe ideal would be to ask those that possess the knowledge. The method of%0D%0Apropagating Islaam which is outlined in the Quraan and Hadith is suficient%0D%0Aand most effective. Also, it should be understood that deen was spread from%0D%0Aheart to heart. Our humble opinion is that this particular website should be%0D%0Aignored and not forwarded to others. The enemies of Islaam operate in very%0D%0Asubtle ways. Let us cling to our Shariat through the guidance of the learned%0D%0AScolars of Deen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
