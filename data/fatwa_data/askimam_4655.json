A Kurdish family had a wedding and my family was invited to it. I told my family that it was haraam to go to the wedding where there is music,dancing and women and men together but they act as if it is not haraam or nothing. I love my family though. They think that their way is correct and my way is wrong. My life is terrible.Even my cousin who is almost an Iman went to the wedding.He admitted that wedding is wrong too. Am i going crazy? or they are? Where is a good place to go to worshipp god and forget this worldy life? Thank you very much. may Allah reward you for this work. Ameen\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Kindly refer below our standard reply to similar queries.%0D%0A1. There are two aspects here: One is I'elaam (to inform) and the other is%0D%0AI'emaal (to make others practice). Informing is merely a means of making%0D%0Aothers practice. The purpose (to make others practice) should be placed%0D%0Afirst and then wisdom should be applied in trying to achieve the purpose.%0D%0A2. Music is expressly prohibited in many Ahaadith. Among the dominant%0D%0Apurposes of our beloved Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was to destroy%0D%0Amusical instruments. (Mishkat vol.2).%0D%0A3. We advise you associate with the Ulama and pious people of your locality%0D%0Aand work towards establishing an Islamic environment. By associating with%0D%0Apious people and more so in the effort of establishing a Deeni environment,%0D%0Ait is more likely you will achieve your purpose of maintaining your faith%0D%0Aand being Shari'ah compliant.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised to perform the Nikah in%0D%0Athe Musjid. Performing the Nikah in the hall is against the Sunnah. It is%0D%0Aimproper for the learned people to perform the Nikah there.%0D%0A2. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'The most blessed Nikah is%0D%0Athe one with least expenses.' Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) also%0D%0Asaid, 'Simplicity is from Imaan.' To have the Nikah in a hall compounded%0D%0Awith a banquet is expensive. That is extravagance. Allah Ta'ala says,. 'The%0D%0Aextravagant ones are the brothers of the Shaytaan.' Such monies may be given%0D%0Aaway to the married couple or saved for a mose useful purpose.%0D%0A3. Islam prohibits intermingling of sexes. It is highly immoral for the%0D%0Abride to be in the hall in open view of all and sundry. How many men may be%0D%0Acasting lustful glances on the bride? She is the central figure of the%0D%0Aoccasion. How many females may be admiring the groom? The evils in an%0D%0Aintermingling gathering are too many to enumerate. In brief, it is death to%0D%0Aone's spirituality."
