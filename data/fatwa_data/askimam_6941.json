  "question": "regarding playing video games considering them beneficial for Jihaad?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI live here in Karachi, one of your friends read 'somewhere' on your site that is permissible to play video games if some 'particular conditions' are met (like no music,animate objects etc) there are two issues here a) he quotes Mufti Taqi Usmani that video games dont come under 'photography' but the fact is the majority of Ulama (of Deoband) consider these as pictures also, then arent we supposed to follow the majority or follow our Nafs/Aqal? b) he also talks about a particular game 'Commandoes', he says that this is 'practice for Jihaad' (mentally) , do u agree that a video game can help for Jihaad? the game also has animate objects in it (i.e. commandoes) request a fatwa ASAP Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There are differences of opinions among the Ulama regarding the images that appear on screens of tv, video, internet, etc. Many Ulama are of the opinion, that such images are pictures and prohibited. It is, therefore, best to exercise Taqwa and abstain.\n\n2. Playing video games as a training for Jihaad is baseless. The game is an entertainment. It got nothing to do with Jihaad training.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
