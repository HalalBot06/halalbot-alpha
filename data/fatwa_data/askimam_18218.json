  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease define the term istihadha. Is it allowed to have sexual intercourse with istihadha?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nIstihādah is the state of a woman if she bleeds for less than three days and three nights or more than ten days and ten nights.  Such a woman will make a fresh wudū for each salāh time and her wudū will be valid, despite her bleeding, until the salāh time ends.  However, if any event which breaks the wudū takes place, such as using the bathroom or passing wind, then the wudū will break as normal. \n\n \n\nIt is permissible for a woman in the state of istihādah to pray, fast, and have sexual intercourse. \n\n \n\n(Heavenly Ornaments, “Haid and Istihaada,” pg. 88-94; Zam Zam)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl. Abrar Mirza,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
