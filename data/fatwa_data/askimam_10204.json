  "question": "1.In Islam, if a person is pious he does not feel any pain or agony at the time of death so howcome a great prophet like Musa Alaihissalam went through so much pain?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu, In Fazail Sadaqat ( Part 2 page 580 of the English translation) in the last paragraph it says When Musa Alaihissalam passed away from this world and met Allah Ta?ala, he was asked about his experience of death. Musa Alaihissalam replied, ? I felt as though I was being burnt alive like a sparrow caught in a flame of fire, without being granted the mercy of death.? A version has it, ? I felt as though I was a goat being skinned alive. 1.In Islam, if a person is pious he does not feel any pain or agony at the time of death so howcome a great prophet like Musa Alaihissalam went through so much pain? 2. In Islam if a person steals his hand should be cut off and if he kills another person he should be killed. In Bani Israel a person killed 100 people and his repentance was accepted by Allah Ta?ala. If a person can just repent why is it necessary in Islam to stone to death or cut the hand? 3. Rasullulah has said that have a lot of children and in fazail sadaqat he prayed to Allah Ta?ala to grant few children and less money to the pious and a lot of children and money to the sinners. I don?t understand the contradiction. Please explain. Jazakallah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Allah gives pain to whom he wishes at the time of death. Sometimes an extremely pious person even a Nabi is made to taste pain either to cleanse him of any small blunders he might have committed during his life or in order to raise his position in the Hereafter. Thus not only Moosa (Alayhis Salaam) but our beloved Nabi (Sallallahu alaihi Wasallam) was made to taste the pangs of death.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The punishments for the various crimes have been laid down by Allah and have a two-fold benefit. One benefit is that it cleanses the sinner of his wrong, if he is remorseful, and the second benefit is that it prevents others from committing this same wrong, as they know the severe punishment that they will have to face. Thus it is necessary to carry out these laws and the rampant crime in todays society is a perfect example of what happens when criminals know they face no real, severe punishment.%0D%0A%0D%0A3.
