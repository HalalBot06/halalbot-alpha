  "question": "Does my son from a previous christian marriage embrace Islam >He lives with both families.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI'm sorry but your 20 words above does not allow the full scene.He is 15yrs old and spends a lot of time with us but his biological mother feels that he should wait until he is older before he decides.His Islamic mom feels that by him not salaahing it may affect the other children in the house and create a jelousy.Please answer ASAP.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf any of the biological parents are a Muslim, then the child is classified as a Muslim and should be brought up as such. If he later refuses to follow Islam, inspite of the concerted efforts of his Muslim parent, then he (the child) would be fully responsible for adopting a path leading to his doom.
