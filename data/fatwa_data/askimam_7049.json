  "answer": "QUESTION\ni am 14 and i like a muslim girl not for her looks but for the sake of ALLAH S.W.T. So what i want know is if i sould tell her or tell my parents, so i can get married to her.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe note that you are only 14 years of age. You do not have experience and insight of life.\n\nMarriage is a major and important step in one?s life. It has many implications. It is, therefore, important to seek the guidance of your seniors before considering anyone for marriage. You should discuss the matter with your parents.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
