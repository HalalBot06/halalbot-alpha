  "question": "Can we use money donated to a department by a Banking Institute?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am working in an educational institute, and the dapartment that I am working in was given a large amount of money by a Banking Institute before I joined the department. This money was invested. Every year, the head of the department takes a potion of this money, usually equivalent to or less that the profits from the investment, and divided it amoungst the staff in the department, as well as some for the general use of the dapartment. Each staff member has an \"account\" into which this money is put, and they can use this to purchase whatever they need, mainly for research purposes. 1. Will it be permissible to use this money? 2. When the department has any functions, this money is used. Will it be permissible to partake in the meals purchased with this money? (Meals are purchased from Halaal sources.) Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If the donation is from a Muslim bank?s Halaal funds, the said donation would be acceptable. Similarly, the donation may be accepted from a non-Muslim bank.\n\n2. Subject to the conditions in one above, it would be permissible to partake of meals purchased with this donation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
