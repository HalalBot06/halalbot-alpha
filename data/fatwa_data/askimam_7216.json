  "question": "Does one need to sacrifice animal(s) during Hajj if he/she has disease of pulling hair and regularly pulls hair out?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am planning to go for Hajj this year but have this disease called Trichotillomania in which a person unconsciously pulls out his/her hair. In my case, I have a habit of pulling/snatching/breaking the hairs off my beard unintentionally. 1. What is the Islamic ruling on this when I go to Hajj and this happens unconsciously during Hajj? 2. Does the Hajj become invalid? If not, do I need to sacrifice an animal? If so: 3. Do I have to sacrifice an animal for each occurrence of pulling hair? 4. How can one avoid doing this (pulling hair)?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If during the state of Ihraam you break off your hair or beard, this should be compensated by giving some charity.\n\n2. The Hajj is valid. There is no need to sacrifice an animal.\n\n3. Ask one of your companions to remind you when they see you doing this.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
