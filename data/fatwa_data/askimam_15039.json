  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs this Aqeeda correct that Prophet s.a.w was made of noor or from Noor of Allah?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is important to know what is meant by noor.  The meaning of noor is light.  Allah Ta’ala in the Qur’an has mentioned the moon as being noor.\n\n \n\nهو الذى جعل الشمس ضياء والقمرنورا\n\nAllah is the being who created the sun bright and the moon noor.\n\n \n\nNoor is a light on its own and also gives light to others.  The meaning that will be taken for noor will be that which is apparent and makes apparent.  For this same reason the Prophets are called noor.  They are guided and they are the medium for others to get guidance.  In the dua اللهم اجعلنى نورا the same is meant.  The names Noorudeen, Noorulislam, Noorullah are kept with the same purpose.  Noor comes in the Qur’an for guidance just as Dhulmat (darkness) comes for going astray.  Allah Ta’ala says in the Qur’an:\n\n \n\nاومن كان ميتا فاحييناه وجعلنا له نورا يمشى به فى الناس كمن مثله فى الظلمات ليس بخارج منها\n\nHe who is dead, then We granted him life and gave him a light by which he may walk among people better than someone like him who is a multitude of darkness from which he will not come out?(Al-Anaam-122)\n\n \n\nFor something to be noor does not mean that it cannot be human also.  If this was the case then it would not be correct for a human to make this dua اللهم اجعلنى نورا, because it would mean, O Allah take me out of the fold of humanity.\n\n \n\nRasullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) was human as well as noor.  Allah Ta’ala says in the Qur’an:\n\nقُلْ إِنَّمَا أَنَا بَشَرٌ مِثْلُكُمْ\n\nSay (O Muhammad) I’m verily a human like yourselves. (Al-Kahf-110)\n\n \n\nAllah Ta’ala say in the Qur’an:\n\nقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ مِنَ اللَّهِ نُورٌ وَكِتَابٌ مُبِينٌ\n\n‎Verily came to you from Allah noor and the clear book. (Al-Maidah-15)\n\n \n\nMany Mufassireen (Commentators of the Qur’an) have stated that by noor here is meant Rasullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam).  The prophet was noor.  He was guidance for the whole of mankind.  Therefore, he was both noor and human.\n\n \n\nTo say that Rasullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) is made of noor or made from the noor of Allah and is not human is incorrect.  Him being human is proven from the ayat of Qur’an.\n\n \n\nFatawa Mahmoodia (1:102) Maktaba Mahmoodia\n\nAhsan Al-Fatawa (1:56) H.M.
