  "question": "Please spell out to the brothers what maintaining their wives means. Some brothers think because the wives work that releaves them of financial responsibility.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI'm in a polygyny marriage and my husband seems to not understand his responsibility of maintenance. I worked and pay all of my bills myself. When I speak to him about puting the responsibility of the maintenance of the house on me. He gives me some excuse because I was pertaining myself before he married me, hes not obligated to provide in maintenance. The situation has really tested my patience. I told him since I am to maintain myself then he is to please his own desires. Now my husband said I'm disobedient.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, according to Shari'ah, it is not permissible for a female to\nwork for no reason. Since you have a husband who is able to maintain you,\nyou should not work.\n\nIt is the sole responsibility of the husband to maintain his wife.\nMaintenance includes, food, clothing and shelter. It is incorrect for the\nhusband to demand from the wife to execute his responsibilities. If he has\nthe means to maintain his wife and he does not do so, he will be sinful.\nWomen who work and have an income are also responsible for their husband's\nnegligence in maintaining them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
