  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nA brother wants to take a Quran from the Musjid, because of the clear writing which he can read. can he purchase a new quraan and put in the musjid in exchange for the one that he wants to take.\n\nWhat is the hiqmat behind sitting and wearing one's trousers?\n\nWhat is the Hikmat of sitting whilst combing one's hair\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. An item that has been given as Waqf to the Musjid may not be sold or exchanged. If there is no use for that item in that Musjid, then it should be given as Waqf to another Musjid. If the item is obsolete or is on the verge of being destroyed, then it should be sold and should be replaced with another Waqf item. (Jamiul Fataawa vol.3 pg.479; Delhi)\n\n2. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has advised that a person should not stand and wear his shoes. (Jamius sahih Hadith9511). Commenting on this Hadith, Allamah Munawi [ra] in his Faydhul Qadeer mentions that the rationale is that standing and wearing one’s shoes might cause unnecessary tiredness and difficulty, e.g. wearing of boots with laces. He further mentions that scholars such as Allaamah Tibi [ra] has extrapolated this rationale to all items which may cause difficulty upon wearing. However, in cases where this rationale cannot be applied, the Hadith does not apply to such items. If there exists fear of harm or difficulty in wearing one’s trousers standing, e.g. falling, slipping, etc. then it is advisable to do so sitting. However, there is absolute permissibility in doing so both standing and sitting.\n\n3. After an extensive search, we were unable to trace any text advising the combing of hair whilst sitting. The rationale mentioned in answer 2 may also be applied here. However, it is permissible to comb one’s hair standing or sitting.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
