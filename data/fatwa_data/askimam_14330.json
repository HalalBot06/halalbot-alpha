  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow can you attain firm conviction in wazifas, how can you believe in it\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nNabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] was sent to mankind as a guide to show man that the pathway to salvation lies in believing in the Oneness of Allah and bringing total faith in Allah. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] came with the invitation to success, the Kalimah Shahaadah that ‘there is no diety besides Allah.’\n\nThis Kalimah shows man that there is only one Supreme Being, nothing occurs without His permission, life and death are in his hands. Man in comparison to Allah is extremely weak. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] showed mankind what was wanted from them by the creator. In many Ahaadith, Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has advised man to recite certain du’aas in the morning and evening for protection for reward. There are different promises on different supplications. There are numerous benefits in reciting those du’aas. When reciting those du’aas, one must keep in mind that this reciting of the Wazifas is from the advices of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], the one was known as al-Ameen (the Trustworthy), the final messenger. Another point to remember is that Allah is all powerful and nothing is more powerful. Remember the promises of Allah and his Rasul [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] are true. Man has to place their reliance on Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
