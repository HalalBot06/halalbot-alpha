  "question": "Explain in detail the performing of Prayers (Salaat) without headgear and short sleeves.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShort sleeves and the Topee (headgear) in Salaat%0D%0A%0D%0AConcerning attire in Salaat, Allah Ta'ala has commanded:%0D%0A\"O children of Adam (mankind), adopt dignified attire at the time of%0D%0ASalaat.\" (Surah A'araaf Aayat 31)%0D%0AIt must be appreciated from the choice of words used in this command, that%0D%0Anot only is covering one's body implied but implicit reference is made%0D%0Atowards a distinctive category of attire. Since Allah Ta'ala has used the%0D%0Aword 'zeenat' (i.e. dignified or appropriate attire) when referring to%0D%0Adressing for Salaat. This fact is affirmed by Mufti Shafi Saheb (R.A) who%0D%0Awrites; \"During Salaat, merely covering one's satr (that part of the body,%0D%0Athe concealing of which is compulsory at all times) is not sufficient but%0D%0Aclothes of dignity (zeenat) which is befitting the sanctity of Salaat will%0D%0Ahave to be adopted. Thus for a male to perform Salaat bareheaded or with his%0D%0Aelbows exposed (with short-sleeves) will be Makrooh (reprehensible) and a%0D%0Acontradiction of 'zeenat'. The Shariat views performing Salaat with%0D%0Ashort-sleeves as Makrooh, whether the shirt itself is short-sleeve or one%0D%0Ahas folded the sleeves.%0D%0A%0D%0ALikewise it would also be Makrooh to perform Salaat wearing demeaning attire%0D%0Athat one would be ashamed to wear in public.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe ruling of Makrooh that has been attached to performing Salaat bareheaded%0D%0Aor with short-sleeves is not only derived from the word 'zeenat' appearing%0D%0Ain the aayat but also has been supported by the Ahaadith of Rasulullah r.%0D%0A(Ma'ariful Quraan Vol.3 Pg.544)%0D%0AAt the time of Salaat, Hasan Basri (R.A) used to adorn himself with the most%0D%0Abeautiful and dignified clothing and used to exclaim that Allah Ta'ala likes%0D%0Abeauty. Therafter he used to, by way of clarification, recite the%0D%0Aaforementioned (Durrul Mukhtaar Vol.1 Pg.599)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0Afor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
