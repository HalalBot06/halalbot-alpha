Please make a lot of dua for us and if you remember, kindly convey our greetings to the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم.\n\n1)      A person’s Iman is only complete once he loves Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم more than his parents, his children and all his belongings. It is narrated in Saheeh Al-Bukhari AND Saheeh Muslim that Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم has said,\n\n15 - حدثنا يعقوب بن إبراهيم قال حدثنا ابن علية عن عبد العزيز بن صهيب عن أنس عن النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم (ح) . وحدثنا آدم قال حدثنا شعبة عن قتادة عن أنس قال قال النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم : ( لا يؤمن أحدكم حتى أكون أحب إليه من والده وولده والناس أجمعين )\n\n “None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his father, his children and mankind in its entirety.” (Bukhari 1/14 and Muslim 1/49)\n\n \n\nIt is firstly essential to discuss the issue of confining the mawlid to the month of Rabi al-awwal. It should be known that Allah Ta’ala has sent the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم with a complete way of life and made him a perfect example for the believers. Allah Ta’ala said,\n\nلَقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِي رَسُولِ اللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ\n\n“Verily for you in the messenger of Allah there was a good example...” (Al Ahzab, 21)\n\nAny action which does not confirm with the prophetic way of life will be rejected in the court of Allah as the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم has said,\n\n \n\nصحيح البخاري - (7 / 146  دار ابن كثير ، اليمامة - بيروت)\n\n2550 - حدثنا يعقوب حدثنا إبراهيم بن سعد عن أبيه عن القاسم بن محمد عن عائشة رضي الله عنها قالت\n\n: قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ( من أحدث في أمرنا هذا ما ليس فيه فهو رد )\n\n \n\n“Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours (i.e., Islaam), it will be rejected” (Saheeh Al-Bukhari 7/146, Dar Ibn Katheer)\n\nThe celebration of the mawlid is an innovation in religion. Neither was it the practice of the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم nor did the companions or tabi’een celebrate this occasion. The great scholar, Allamah Anwar Shah Al-Kashmiri (May Allah Ta'ala be pleased with him) has said,\n\nالعرف الشذي شرح سنن الترمذي - (2 / 82 مؤسسة ضحى للنشر والتوزيع(\n\nوأحدثه صوفي في عهد سلطان إربل سنة ( 600 ) ، ولم يكن له أصل من الشريعة الغراء\n\n “A sufi innovated it in the era of Sultan Irbil around the year 600 A.H, and it does not have any basis in our pure Shariah.”\n\nScholars state that the first person to introduce the innovation (bid'a) of celebrating the Milad was the ruler of Irbil, Muzaffar ad-Din ibn Zain al-Din. This was six centuries after the period of prophet hood.\n\nAllaamah Muizzuddin Hasan Khwaarzimi (rahmatullah alayh) states in his book, Al-Qawl al Mu’tamad, \n\n“The Ruler of Irbal, King Muzaffar Abu Saeed Kaukari, was an irreligious and prodigal king. He ordered the scholars of his time to act according to their opinions and discard the practice of following any school of law. A group of learned men inclined towards him. He (this king) organized Mawlood sessions during the month of Rabi al Awwal. He was the first king ever to introduce this practice.”\n\nA ‘scholar’ by the name of Abul Khattab Umar bin Hasan bin Dihya Al Andalusi supported and assisted the king in this innovation.\n\n\nAllamah Ibn Kathir (May Allah Ta'ala have mercy on him) has reported on the authority of As-Sabt about this person,\n\nالبداية والنهاية - (13 / 169دار إحياء التراث العربي)\n\nقال السبط: وقد كان كابن عنين في ثلب المسلمين والوقيعة فيهم، ويتزيد في كلامه فترك الناس الرواية عنه وكذبوه\n\n\n“Ibn Unain (Ibn Dihya) used to insult the Muslims and vilify them. He would make additions in his report and exaggerate. The people stopped narrating traditions from him and falsified him.” (Al-Bidaya wa al-Nihaya, 3/144-146)\n\nIbn Hajar Al-Asqalani (May Allah Ta'ala have mercy on him) has commented on him,\n\n \n\nلسان الميزان - (4 / 296مؤسسة الأعلمي للمطبوعات – بيروت)\n\nوكان ظاهري المذهب كثير الوقيعة في الأئمة وفي السلف من العلماء خبيث اللسان أحمق شديد الكبر قليل النظر في أمور الدين متهاونا\n\n\n“He was a follower of the Zahiri school of thought and often slandered the scholars and the scholars of the past. He possessed an evil tongue and was stupid, self-conceited, lacked insight in religious matters, and looked down upon religion.”  (Lisan al-Mizan, 4/296)\n\nFrom the afore-mentioned it becomes apparent which type of people innovated the celebration of the mawlid. The companions loved the Prophet the most yet they did not celebrate the mawlid. They remained alive after him for about a century, but despite their unparalleled and profound love towards the Holy Prophet (Peace and salutations be on him), they never celebrated his birthday.  If the mawlid was a meritorious and divinely inspired act, then surely Rasulullah would have commanded the Ummah to celebrate it, or at least, either he or his noble Companions would have practiced on it. Since it cannot be substantiated by any action of theirs, it becomes crystal clear that celebrating the mawlid has absolutely no relationship with Islam and it is Bidáh (innovation).\n\nFurthermore, there are numerous other vices which take place at a mawlid. Music, intermingling of sexes, squandering of wealth, omitting compulsory prayers etc. are just few of the many wrongs which takes place on such occasions. Moreover, the Celebration of the mawlid is an imitation of the Christians, who celebrate the birth of the Messiah (peace be upon him).\n\nIn light of the above, it will not be permissible to celebrate the mawlid even if a person beliefs that the Prophet is not present. Muslims should rather strive to revive the Sunnah and put an end to bid’ah (innovation); they should not do any action until they know the ruling of Allaah concerning it.    \n\nIf gatherings are conducted at a random in which the love of Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم is discussed and people are encouraged to follow the Sunnah, then that is permissible on condition there is nothing un-Islamic in such gatherings.  \n\n \n\nThis ruling is derived from the following narration of Saheeh Al-Bukhari and Saheeh Muslim,\n\n6539 - حدثنا عمرو الناقد وإسحاق بن إبراهيم وابن أبى عمر كلهم عن سفيان قال عمرو حدثنا سفيان بن عيينة عن الزهرى عن سعيد عن أبى هريرة أن عمر مر بحسان وهو ينشد الشعر فى المسجد فلحظ إليه فقال قد كنت أنشد وفيه من هو خير منك. (متفق عليه)\n\n \n\nAbu Hurairah narrates, “Umar once passed by Hassaan who was saying poetry in the Masjid. He glanced angrily towards Hassaan. Hassaan responded, “I used to say poetry and in the Masjid there used to be one who is greater than you (meaning Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم).” (Bukhari and Muslim)\n\n2)      As for this question we will prepare a detailed response as time permits in the near future, insha Allah. For now we will suffice by mentioning the summary of Allamah Abid Sindhi on this issue. He mentions,\n\n \n\n“It is only permissible (and meritorious) to kiss the hands and feet of a pious scholar, a just ruler or a person who has some religious reputation. To kiss anyone else with this intention would not be permissible. The reason for this is that the Ahadith only mentions kissing the hands and feet of noble people.” (Jawahir al fiqh 1/185, Maktabah Tafseer al Quran)\n\n \n\n3)      It is reported in an authentic narration that the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم has said,\n\n110 - حدثنا موسى قال حدثنا أبو عوانة عن أبي حصين عن أبي صالح عن أبي هريرة: عن النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم قال « ومن رآني في المنام فقد رآني حقا فإن الشيطان لا يتمثل في صورتي »(متفق عليه)\n\n“Whoever has seen me in a dream, then verily he has seen me, for the devil cannot take my appearance.” (1/52, Dar Ibn Katheer, Beirut, Saheeh Muslim 7/54, Dar al jeel, Beirut)\n\nIt is clear from this narration that you have definitely been honoured with seeing the Prophet (Peace and salutations be on him) in your dream. It does not matter if you forgot how the Prophet (Peace and salutations be on him) looks.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
