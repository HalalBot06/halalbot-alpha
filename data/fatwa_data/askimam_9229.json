Waiting to hear from you for the above questions.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It has been stated in Fataawaa Aalamgeeriyyah that there is no harm in printing the blessed name of Allah on dirhams and gold coins. The reason stated is that this is done in order to recognize a Muslim currency and not to disgrace or humiliate the name of Allah. The same ruling will apply for the Saudi Arabian currency. (Fataawaa Aalamgeeriyyah, Vol. 5, Page 323) %0D%0A%0D%0A2. Four Rak?aats Sunnah are to be performed before and after the two Rak?aats Fardh of Jumuah. Thereafter one should perform two Rak?aats Sunnah and two Rak?aats Nafl. (Tirmidhi, Page 118) %0D%0A%0D%0A3. In the abovementioned manner. %0D%0A%0D%0A4. For the method of performing Salaat, please refer to a local ?Aalim of your area or the book Bahishti Zewar of Moulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi (R.A.A.) which is also available in English and known as Heavenly Ornaments. %0D%0A%0D%0A5. We do not find any explicit text to prove that it is Makrooh to swing%2Fshake while reciting the Qur?an or during Du?aa. What we do find is that the Shariah encourages its followers to be peaceful and humble while making du?aa and reciting the Qur?an, therefore it is desired that a person makes the least amount of movements during these actions. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Ashraf%0D%0ADARUL IFTA ?
