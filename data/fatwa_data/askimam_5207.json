Is that considered a good or a bad thing. Can the guy ask the girl about her opinions about the guy. What can be done in order to arrange the wedding. Please provide some Hadiths as well. Jazakal Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer below our standard reply to similar queries.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0APRACTICAL LESSONS FROM HADITH%0D%0ADo Not Delay%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi (SAW) said: \"Do not delay in three things, Salaat when its time has%0D%0Aarrived; the marriage of a solitary woman when her match is found and the%0D%0AJanaza Salaat of a deceased when the braise is ready\". (Targhib).%0D%0A%0D%0AThe practically of the advice given in this Hadith cannot possibly ever be%0D%0Aquestioned. As to the advice of not delaying Salaat or Janaza Salaat one can%0D%0Aquite easily fathom the great number of benefits and wisdom behind such%0D%0Aadvice. However, it is our intention to specifically discuss the point of%0D%0Athe marriage of a woman whose match has been found. We have generally become%0D%0Aextremely negligent in this regard and we find marriages delayed for months%0D%0Aon end on absolutely baseless and trivial grounds. The girl is too young%0D%0A(although in the age factor doesn't step her from ranking around with the%0D%0Aboy); my uncle from avenues will be coming in six months time; we can't get%0D%0Aa booking in a 'certain' hall; let him finish his studies, etc. These are%0D%0Ajust some of the more common excuses put forward by those who have an%0D%0Aintention of acting on the invaluable advice of our beloved Nabi (SAW). The%0D%0Afact of the matter is that marriage is such a venture that, once embarked%0D%0Aupon, should not be beset with delay.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn most cases the question for a partner is motivated by the development of%0D%0Aa certain level of maturity and physical need in a person. In delaying the%0D%0Amatter, especially now that the couple have established inclination for one%0D%0Aanother by committing themselves to marriage, we are in fact creating a%0D%0Avolatile and dangerous situation. They are bound to try and express their%0D%0Aneed someway or the other and by delaying the marriage, we are in fact%0D%0Abecoming the means for the doers of sin and transpession being opened.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe often witness nowadays the manner in which prospective couples mix with%0D%0Aone another and go all over the places. Such Haraam practices are even%0D%0Acondoned and encouraged by the parents who simply explain it all away by%0D%0Asaying: \"they are engaged\". In many cases it is exactly such Haraam%0D%0Aintermingling which result in disastrous consequences and often leads the%0D%0Amarriage not occurring at all while the couple (the girl especially) has to%0D%0Alive with the stigma against them.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe abovementioned is just one of the harms of failure to practice upon this%0D%0Abeautiful injunction of our beloved Nabi (SAW). Another point to consider is%0D%0Athe fact that the prolonging of the affair serves as a catalogist to ensure%0D%0Athat more and more unnecessary extravagance and wastage accompanies the%0D%0ANikah (when it finally takes place), since the more time there is the%0D%0Agreater and more affluent the preparation will be.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe list of harms goes on but the bottom line is that those endowed with%0D%0Atrue love for Nabi (SAW) will unquestioningly practice upon the Sunnah%0D%0Aregardless of whether they understand the benefit or not. It is exactly this%0D%0Aspirit of emulation that we so badly need."
