  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQuestion:%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom my childhood I heard that before day of judgment Imam Mahdi will come%0D%0Ain this world and after that Hazrat Eisa will come and Hazrat Eisa will%0D%0Aoffer his prayer after the Imaam of that time because he will come as an%0D%0AUmmati of Muhammad, but few days back a friend of mine told me that its just%0D%0Aa misconception in sunnies and we don't believe in any Imaam mahdi and the%0D%0AImaams are only for shias. So I really like you to enlighten me with this.%0D%0A%0D%0AYour brother%0D%0A%0D%0AAnswer:%0D%0A%0D%0ARespected Brother-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0AImaam Mahdi will certainly come before the day of Qiyaamat. Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Even if there were only one day left%0D%0Afor the world, Allah would send a man from amongst us to fill the world with%0D%0Ajustice, just as it had been filled with oppression and injustice.' (Ahmad)%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'The Mahdi is one of us, from%0D%0Aamong the people of my household. In one night Allah will inspire him and%0D%0Aprepare him to carry out his task successfully.' (Ahmad)%0D%0A%0D%0AAbu Dawud devoted a whole chapter of his Sunan on the subject of the Mahdi.%0D%0A%0D%0AAbdullah (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) said, 'A man from my household whose name is like mine will take%0D%0Apower.' (Tirmidhi)%0D%0A%0D%0AThawbaan narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Three%0D%0Amen will be killed at the place where your treasure is. Each of them will be%0D%0Athe son of a Khalifah and none of them will get hold of the treasure. Then%0D%0Athe black banners will come out of the east, and they will slaughter you in%0D%0Aa way which has never been seen before.' Then he said something which I do%0D%0Anot remember, 'then if you see him, go and give him your allegiance, even if%0D%0Ayou have to crawl over ice because he is the Khalifah of Allah, the Mahdi.'%0D%0A(Ibn Majah)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe treasure referred to in this text is the treasure of the Ka'bah. Towards%0D%0Athe end of time, three of the sons of the Khalifahs will fight to get hold%0D%0Aof it, until the Mahdi appears.%0D%0A%0D%0AAbu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) said, 'By him in whose my soul is, surely the son of Mary will cme%0D%0Adown among you as a just ruler. He will break the cross, kill the pigs and%0D%0Aabolish the Jizyah. Wealth will be in such abundance that noone will care%0D%0Aabout it, and a single prostration in prayer will be better than the world%0D%0Aand all that is in it.' Abu Hurayra said, 'If you wish recite the Aayat -%0D%0Aand there is none of the people of the book but must believe in him before%0D%0Ahis death, and on the day of Qiyaamat he will be a witness against them.'%0D%0A(Bukhari; Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
