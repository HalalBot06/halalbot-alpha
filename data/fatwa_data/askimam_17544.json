  "question": "Salaatul Istikhara and my dream",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI prayed salaat istikhara to ask ALLAH if he is right for me. After a few nights I cant remember anything, if i have dreamed or not. Then one night, my dream was very clear to me. I went inside like a big white prayer room or masjid and in the middle is the imaam sitting and writing something. I want to greet him but i got my words jumbled up. He is a very young imaam ( around mid 30's like me) no beard and looks very sporty. I introduced myself and he said hello sister Khadijah.\n\nMy istikhara is for a young 36years old, clean cut professional sports player that somewhat resembled the imam. What is the meaning of my dream, please? Is this a good sign from ALLAH? Please help me...i want to get married again after a failed first marriage to a christian ( I am a new revert muslim with no mahram). My two boys needs a father (sadly their real dad refuse to support them now..he will support them when they reach college).\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nPlease forgive the long delay in responding to your mail.\n\nAlhamdoelillah, you have been guided to the right path. May Allah Ta'ala protect your imaan and no matter what obstacles you encounter, may He comfort you and keep you within His protection, ameen.  Remain firm in your faith and if possible, confide in a Muslim friend to support you emotionally.\n\nSister, It is firstly suggested that you obtain a legal divorce from your Christian husband. Try to make as simple and easy for yourself as possible.\n\nIf he and your family know that you are Muslim, they may just try to make things difficult for you. So be as discrete as possible till your divorce comes through. Since you earn more than him, you should be ok financially.\n\nSecondly, try to teach your children the basics of Islam and with gentle guidance let them flow into Islam with ease so that they do not resent the introduction to the faith.\n\nDo not allow your family to intimidate you at all. This will be a test in your life and Allah Ta'ala is always with you, do not fear or despair. Your dream appears to be a positive one. You can approach the imaam of the closet masjid to you to assist you in proposing and arranging the marriage to the man you write about.  \n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\nSocial Dept.\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
