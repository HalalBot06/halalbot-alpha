  "question": "My friend lives about 9,000 km away from Mecca. Can he enter Mecca without putting on the Ihramor is it \"haram\" for him not to wear Ihram?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nOur country is Singapore, about 9,000 km away from Mecca. We are practising Muslims. This 27th October, my friend's son will be in Mecca for the Tahfiz Competition. He is required to accompany his son because he is 10 years old. If without intending to perform the Umrah, can my friend enter Mecca wearing his normal long pants and shirt. That is to say not putting on the two unsewn pieces of white robe. Is it Haram or sinful for him not to wear it when entering the Holy City of Mecca? God bless you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is compulsory for a person entering the land of Makkah Mukarramah to don the Ihraam before the Meeqaat. If he passes the Meeqaat without the Ihraam, he will have to give a penalty.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
