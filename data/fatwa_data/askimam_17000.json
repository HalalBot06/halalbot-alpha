  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am a muslim female and want to know what ehtelaam is. I know you have to make ghusl after ehtelaam but what is it? I think it is an urdu word.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nEhtelaam is a wet dream.  If anyone (man or woman) awakens from his sleep and notices some wetness on his body or clothing, then there can be many possibilities in this.  Ghusl will become fardh in the following conditions:\n1) a person has conviction or is quite sure that it is semen and even remembers having a wet dream\n2) he is convinced that it is semen but does not remember having a wet dream\n3) he is convinced that it is pre-coital fluid (mazi) and even remembers having a wet dream\n4) he is not sure as to whether it is semen or pre-coital fluid but remembers having a wet dream\n5) he is not sure as to whether it is semen or wadi (liquid that precedes urine) but remembers having a wet dream\n6) he is not sure as to whether it is pre-coital fluid or wadi but remembers having a wet dream\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\nReference: Heavely Ornaments pg. 74\n\n\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai (F1)\nDarul Iftaa"
