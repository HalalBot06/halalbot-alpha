  "question": "I would like to know how take faal out of the Quran, and what are the methods to do it, please explain in detail.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFaal simply means to take a good omen, for example, Allah Ta'ala mentions\nthat He granted Moosa (Alayhis salaam) victory over the tyrant Fir'awn.\n\nThus, for example, if the Ameer of the Mujaahideen is a person by the name\nMoosa, it will be a Faal (good omen), to hope that vistory will also be\ngained at his hands. This is the meaning of 'Faal'. There is no particular\nmethod of taking good omen from the Qur'aan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
