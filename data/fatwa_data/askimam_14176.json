  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. I wanted to know can I take money of a friend, knowing that it is not halaal?\n\n2. Can I borrow money of a friend knowing the money is not halaal?\n\n2. Can I eat food from a friend that purchses his goods with haraam money?\n\n3. If a friend gives me an asset (which is brought with haraam money), e.g, a present, car to keep....can I accept it?\n\n4. Can i purchase from a friend with halaaal money an asset of his that he brought with haraam money? \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn principle, if a Muslim person’s major source of income is from Haraam, then it is not permissible to have any dealings with such a person in relation to his income. It is not permissible to accept a gift from him whether it is in cash or kind. It is also not permissible to purchase an asset from him.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
