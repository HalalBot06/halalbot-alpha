The four months period in which there was no physical relationship will not be considered as the iddat period.\n2. The menses after the two days of divorce will be regarded as the first menses of the three menses of iddat.\n3. It is not permissible for her to do shopping during the iddat period.\n4. She may go to work and return home immediately after work and observe the rules of iddat.\n\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
