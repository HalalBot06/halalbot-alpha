  "question": "Obligatory ghusl, can I do without washing hair and doing only masah because of health problem?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have sinus problem and keep suffering from frequent flu and cold. The problem worsens and my condition further deteriorates whenever I take a ghusl (that is when I wash my hair while taking ghusl). So I would like to know that whenever there is a fear of my health getting affected, can I just do masah on my hair while doing ghusl-e-janabat or any other obligatory ghusl?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf water, whether cold or hot, is harmful to you, and a reliable physician has prohibited you from using water then you may make Masah without washing your hair in an obligatory Ghusl.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
