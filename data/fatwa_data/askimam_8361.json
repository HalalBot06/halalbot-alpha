  "question": "1)I make sajda sahu only when I am sure that something was wrong or if I suspect that is enough? 2)Should I renew wudu if i am only 90% or so sure that it is broken or 100% must be there",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen making salaat I always fear least something was wrong and make sajda sahu. Is it right? Should I make sajda sahu only when I am sure that something was wrong or if I suspect that is enough? Should I renew wudu if i am only 90% or so sure that it is broken or 100% must be there, i.e. going to toilet, seeing wetnees or passing wind?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Sajdah-e-Sahw is made only if a Waajib act of Salaat was omitted. If one is confident that he omitted a Waajb act of Salaat, then only he should make Sajda-e-Sahw.\n\n2. If one is confident that Wudhu has been broken, then he must renew his Wudhu. However, it is commendable to renew Wudhu for every Fardh Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
