  "question": "Can a women lead an Organisation if there is no one else to accept the responsibilty. what are the guidelines for her?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs Salam U Ailaikum Mufti Sahib. Please help me in solving my problem. Lately I have been appointed as the President of the Islamic Society of our college. I accepted the post as I thought that I can use it for spreading the word of Allah more easily but now I have realized that I was better off before being the president. I use to pray on time but nowadays sometimes I even pray after the time is over which never use to happen before. Moreover there is a girl in the society since past four years. She is better than me in managing everything and I think by being the president I am not doing justice with her. Please let me know that if it?s allowed in Islam for the women to head an organization if there is no one who is willing and capable of holding that post. Under what circumstances she can lead the organization and what will be the guide lines for her if she is elected as the President. Jazak Allah Khair. May Allah reward you for this and everything you do for Muslim Ummah. Wassalam. Your brother in Islam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala says in the noble Qur'aan, 'Men are protectors of woman because%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala has given them more strength and because they support them from%0D%0Atheir means.' (Nisaa AAYAT34)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn this case, the word, 'protectors' refers to one who stands firm in%0D%0Aprotecting other's interests, looks after his affairs, business, etc. The%0D%0Acommentators of the noble Qur'aan have written under the abovementioned%0D%0Averse that Allah Ta'ala has chosen men and has given them virtue over women.%0D%0AWhilst men have many responsibilities to take care of, females also have%0D%0Aresponsibilities. The responsibility of men having authority over women is%0D%0Anot confined to only religious matters, but it is general and refers to any%0D%0Amatter, be it religious, political or with regard to any department, council%0D%0Aor organization. This authority for the male over the female does not%0D%0Abelittle the status of woman in the least bit.%0D%0A%0D%0ATo make us understand, the example of a male and female is like that of the%0D%0Ahead and the hand. Whilst the male being the head if the most important part%0D%0Aof the body and holds the most amount of respect and authority, this in on%0D%0Away whatsoever proves that the hand (woman) is useless and has no status in%0D%0Athe body. The matter about woman having more capabilities than men does not%0D%0Ahold much weight since the basis for the authority of men over women is not%0D%0Acapabilities, intelligence, wealth or any other material entity which can be%0D%0Aacquired.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe commentators have clearly stated that the virtue and authority that has%0D%0Abeen given to men is on the basis of their species, i.e. because they are%0D%0Amen. Hence, it is a great possibility that there are many women who have%0D%0Agreat potential, intelligence and wealth and seem to be more worthy for%0D%0Aleadership. However, Allah Ta'ala has, in his infinite mercy and wisdom,%0D%0Astipulated this position for men on the basis of them being men even though%0D%0Athey may at time lack in capabilities and expertise as compared to women.%0D%0A(Ma'ariful Qur'aan vol.2 pg.396; Deoband)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
