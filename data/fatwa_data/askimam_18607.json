Your being worried about your sister is also a great blessing of Allah and may Allah reward you greatly.\n\n \n\nAt the same time, keep in mind that being so harsh on your sister (like hitting her) will not bring around the change you are hoping to achieve. You mother is right about that, and you should follow her advice.\n\n \n\nAllah says in the Quran: “So, it is through mercy from Allah that you are gentle to them. Had you been rough and hard-hearted, they would have dispersed from around you. So pardon them and seek forgiveness from them...” (Surah Aal-Imraan, Chaper 3, Verse 159). In inviting to Allah, the commentators of the Quran say that harshness in conduct or language is sheer poison for dawah and reform efforts.\n\n \n\nSo it is important that you do not get frustrated or angry when your sister speaks ill of you. You may let her know that what she says hurts you. You should also advise her that we should speak respectfully with family members, especially elders and older siblings - but do not retaliate with similar remarks, otherwise you would be guilty of the same.\n\n \n\nAt the same time, you should not stop your efforts to make her realize the grave sin she is involved in. To temper your anger and harshness, memorize and frequently make the following dua:\n\nاللهم اني أعوذبك من منكرات الأخلاق والأعمال \n\n(Transliteration: Allahumma inni aouzubika min munkaraatil akhlaaqi wal a'maal)\n\n(Translation: O my Allah, I seek refuge in you from despicable character and actions)\n\n \n\nRemember that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) has innumerable great qualities in him, but the one that Allah chose to identify specifically was: “And you are surely on an exalted quality of character” (Surah Nun (Chapter 68, Verse 3).\n\n \n\nThe same was expected of his followers. When the companion, Muadh ibn Jabal was leaving for Yemen after being appointed as governor, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) advised him: “O Mua'dh display your best character with people.”\n\n \n\nYou being the male head of the household are in a leadership position, if you do not display good character, tolerance and patience in trying to make your sister understand, then she will become more aggravated and more involved in the wrongful activities she is currently in.\n\n \n\nContinue to use practical ways of explaining to her, do not despair or give up. For example, would she prefer being a tool to be used and disposed of by men who see her only as an object, or would she prefer being an honorable companion united in nikah to a committed and caring husband.\n\n \n\nReferences:\n\nMaariful Quran, Volume 8, pg 553 (English Edition)\n\nMaarful Quran, Volume 3, pgs 225-226 (English Edition)\n\nMisali Ustaadh, Part 1, pg. 47 (Urdu Edition)\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best \n\n Ml.
