  "question": "wife finds three more for her husband",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am married woman whose husband is a convert.We had met in university, he had shown interest in Islam, and I introduced him to my parents. My husband and I are from different backgrounds, he's European, and I'm South Asian. I married my husband because he is a kind man, he inspires me to be better Islam and has made me understand things about Islam that I have taken for granted. I have a question about polygamy. I understand that it is an option in Islam and that the husband has a right to marry a second wife. I would obey my husband's wishes if he wanted to marry a second wife for Allah Tallah's sake. I have told my husband that I am ok with his decision. \n\nI however feel very hurt and distant myself from my husband. This other woman is non-muslim, (who's considering to convert) whom he had loved before meeting me, and he says he still loves her. My husband is a convert and he says that he married me first because I was muslim and exposed him to Islam. I understand that my husband is being honest, he says he loves us both and wants to do the right thing. I want to accept it, but I hurt in seeing my husband with someone else. Does this make me materialistic and sinful? I want to be a good muslim, set an example for my husband that I accept Islam fully and I want to please God. I have no doubts about Islam. My concern is that I'm having difficulty in accepting polygamy.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nJazakallah khair for writing to the institute about your difficulty in accepting the idea that your husband wishes to take another wife, an option which is allowed in Islam. Sister, you are but human and it is natural that you feel the way you do. Nabi's (sallallaahu alayhi wassallam) wives also competed for his affection and there was competition between them too.\n\nAlhamdulillah, you have already earned Allah Ta'ala's pleasure for being His 'instrument' in bringing your husband towards Islam and for helping him to practice it. For every good deed your husband performs, you too will reap the rewards thereof. You appear to have much knowledge of your faith and I get the impression that although you are experiencing pain regarding this issue, there is an air of resignation in your mail to us. Sister, look towards the greater rewards you stand to earn in the hereafter for the pain you experience in this world. It may not be easy for you but insha'allah, try to persevere and ask Allah Ta'ala for guidance, acceptance of what He has allowed and to grant you the highest stages in Jannah for this 'loss' that you feel in this world.\n\nAllow me to relate some events a friend of mine told me about when she returned from a 'jamaat' trip to England. Their group had spent time with a lady who had invited a night club dancer to Islam and thereafter asked the revert sister to marry her husband. This lady then went ahead and found another lady whom she invited to Islam and thereafter promptly asked the lady to be a third wife. At this point my friend went sort of, \" Hold on, what are you telling me? This is what happened in the times of the Sahaba. I hear what you say but I find it difficult to understand that you are now actively working towards finding a fourth wife for your husband\".\n\nThe lady's prompt reply was ( as I recall), \" These ladies have accepted Islam and I wish for them to maintain and practice it. A husband is but part of this world. I am working towards my hereafter and the rewards which await me there are nothing compared to this world\". She indicated that a husband is but part of this world, finite and perishable as she is. However, with him she could attain the best in the aagirah. May Allah Ta'ala comfort, guide and continue to cherish you, ameen. Please feel free to write again if you wish.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best.\n\nSister Fadila\nSocial dept.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
