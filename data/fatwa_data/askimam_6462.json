  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJUMMU'AH GUIDELINES - JADOO %2F SIHR %2F BLACK MAGIC%0D%0A%0D%0AA R A B I C%0D%0ASay, I seek refuge with the Rabb of the Morning from the evil of created%0D%0Athings; and from the night when it spreads, and from those who blow into%0D%0Aknots (practice secret arts), and from the evil of a jealous person. (Surah%0D%0Aal-Falaq; 113)%0D%0A%0D%0AA R A B I C%0D%0ASay, I seek refuge with the Sustainer of mankind, the King of people, Rabb%0D%0Aof the people, from he evil of the whisperer who withdraws; he who whispers%0D%0Ainto the hearts of people; from Jin and human. (Surah An-Naas; 114)%0D%0A%0D%0AA Jew by the name of Labid did black magic on Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi%0D%0AWasallam). He took the hair of Rasulullah and made eleven knots into a date%0D%0Aand placed in under a rock in the well called Zarwan. The effect of this was%0D%0Athat it created uncertainty in the mind of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi%0D%0AWasallam) as to whether he had done or not done certain things. At times%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) felt he had accomplished something%0D%0Ayet he had not done so and vice versa. Jibraaeel (AS) informed Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) as to what had occurred and brought the above%0D%0Amentioned two Surahs. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) together with%0D%0Athe Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhu) went to the well and removed the knotted%0D%0Ahair. As each Aayat was recited, the knots untied miraculously. At the%0D%0Aeleventh knot, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) was relieved.%0D%0A(Tafseer Ibn Katheer vol.4 pg.614; Darul Ma'rifah)%0D%0A%0D%0AOne may wonder, how is it that the Prophet of Allah was affected with Jadoo.%0D%0AHe had so much of faith in Allah, how could Jadoo affect him?%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Reality of Jadoo%0D%0AJadoo has a natural effect just as the sun has an effect of heat. The%0D%0AProphets%2FAmbiyaa (alaihimus salaam) felt the heat on hot days, they felt%0D%0Ahungry when they didn't eat, similarly they could be affected with Jadoo as%0D%0Awell. But this Jadoo did not interrupt their prophethood status nor was it%0D%0Aallowed to interfere with the authenticity of their mission.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHIS WORLD - CAUSE%2FEFFECT%0D%0AAlmighty Allah Ta'ala created this entire universe and he has designed its%0D%0Afunctions according to the cause and effect procedure. Everything has a%0D%0Acause which subsequently has a natural effect. When the sun shines, it is%0D%0Ahot, when snow falls it is cold. Heat and cold are the natural effects of%0D%0Athe sun and snow. Similarly, if a person is stabbed with a knife, he will%0D%0Ableed. Bleeding is a natural effect of stabbing. If a person is thrown in%0D%0Athe center of the sea, he will naturally drown if he cannot swim.%0D%0A%0D%0AOur Belief%0D%0AAlthough this world functions according to the cause%2Feffect procedure but%0D%0Athe effect of anything lies in the Will of Allah. If Allah Wills, the%0D%0Aeffects of causes will exist but, if Allah does not will, then in -spite of%0D%0Athe means we adopt, the effects will not exist.%0D%0A%0D%0AIncidents%0D%0A1- Namrood told his people to make a fire to burn Ibraheem ('alaihis%0D%0Asalaam). After the fire was lit, due to the flames being very high, Ibraheem%0D%0A('alaihis salaam) was put on a catapult to be thrown into the fire.%0D%0AAlthough the effect of the fire is to burn, Ibraheem ('alaihis salaam) did%0D%0Anot burn. This was because it was not the Will of Allah for the fire to be%0D%0Aeffective. (Ibid vol.3 pg.192)%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah told the fire: [ a r a b i c ]%0D%0A\"Oh fire, be cool and peaceful upon Ibraheem.\" (Qur'an 21 V 69)%0D%0A%0D%0A2- A knife has a natural effect of cutting, the cut could also sometimes be%0D%0Afatal. Ibraheem ('alaihis salaam) passed the knife on his son Ismaaeel%0D%0A('alaihis salaam) but the knife did not show its natural effect because%0D%0Ait was not the will of Allah Ta'ala for it to cut. (Tafseer ibn Katheer%0D%0Avol.4 pg.18; Darul Ma'rifah)%0D%0A%0D%0A3- Firoun and his army were drowned in the Red Sea but the same Red Sea did%0D%0Anot drown Moosa (alaihis salaam) and his army.%0D%0A%0D%0AAll these incidents clearly indicate that effects of causes are through the%0D%0AWill of Allah Ta'ala. Allah Ta'ala is the One who gives effect to the%0D%0Acause.%0D%0A%0D%0ABlack Magic%0D%0A%0D%0AA R A B I C%0D%0A'And they followed what Shaitaan had recited on the Kingdom of Sulaimaan%0D%0A('alaihis salaam), and Sulaimaan ('alaihs salaam) did not transgress but the%0D%0AShaitaans did it by teaching the people Black Magic' (Qur'an 2 V 102)%0D%0A%0D%0ABlack magic was common at the time of Sulaiman (alaihis salaam). The%0D%0AShaitaan used to teach the people black magic. Allah sent two angels, Haroot%0D%0Aand Maaroot, as a test to the people. They taught the people the practice of%0D%0Ablack magic but warned them that they have been sent as a test from Allah,%0D%0Aso the people should not abuse this knowledge. Allah further says:%0D%0A%0D%0AA R A B I C%0D%0A\"They (people practicing black magic) cannot harm anyone but with the Will%0D%0Aof Allah\". (Qur'an 2 V 102)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Challenge%0D%0AMoosa (alaihis salaam) and the people practicing witchcraft at the time of%0D%0AFiroun is mentioned in the Qur'an. Moosa (alaihis salaam) was victorious and%0D%0AAllah further says:%0D%0A%0D%0A[ a r a b i c ]%0D%0A\"A witchdoctor%2Fperson practicing black magic does not succeed wherever he%0D%0Agoes\" (Qur'an 20 V 69).%0D%0A%0D%0ALabid Ibn A'sam practiced black magic (witchcraft) on Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) and he was affected for about 6 months, until%0D%0Athe Surahs of 'An-naas' and 'Al-falaq' were revealed. Thereafter Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) was cured. (Ibid vol.4 pg.614)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above explanation is clear that black magic is a reality and it has its%0D%0Aeffects but only with the Will of Allah, just as poison has its effects with%0D%0Athe Will of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhy do people resort to black magic, Jadoo, etc.?%0D%0A%0D%0AGenerally, people are driven to black magic due to jealousy.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen a person has a flourishing business or popular and holds a%0D%0Adistinguishing postion in society, etc. this is not tolerated and accepted%0D%0Aby others. People desire that those prosperities be taken away from their%0D%0Abrother. This jealousy causes a person to harm his brother. His ultimate%0D%0Apurpose is to cool his eyes by witnessing his brother's downfall. Thus he%0D%0Astoops to the despicable and Haraam act of Jadoo to achieve his ambition.%0D%0A%0D%0AJealousy%0D%0AJealousy is an internal sickness, like pride and anger. If it is not cured,%0D%0Athe consequences of jealousy are very dangerous to oneself and the society%0D%0Ain general. The jealous person is actually objecting to Allah's decree: \"Why%0D%0Adid You give him wealth, why did You give him position?. Why haven't I been%0D%0Agiven this wealth and position?\"%0D%0A%0D%0ASuch a person needs to strengthen his Imaan on Taqdeer. Everything is%0D%0Apredestined. When a person is in the womb of his mother, his sustenance,%0D%0Alife and position is already written. Everything happens according to the%0D%0Aabsolute Knowledge of Allah (Taqdeer). Such a person must repeatedly remind%0D%0Ahimself that he is helpless in determining other peoples' affairs. The%0D%0Aaffairs of people are controlled by Allah Ta'ala. Ponder upon the Hadith of%0D%0AJealousy.%0D%0A%0D%0A[ a r a b i c ]%0D%0AHadhrath Abu Huraira (RA) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi%0D%0AWasallam) said; Beware of jealousy, for jealousy eats up good deeds just as%0D%0Afire eats up (burns) wood (Mishkat 46 pg. 248)%0D%0A%0D%0A[ a r a b i c ]%0D%0AHadhrath Zubair (RA) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam)%0D%0Asaid, 'The sickness of the previous nations will creep into you, i.e.%0D%0Ajealousy and hatred. These sicknesses are shavers; I don't say they shave%0D%0Ahair but they shave Deen\". (Mishkat 2 Pg. 428)%0D%0A%0D%0AA Jealous person is void of the spirit of Deen. His heart is always filled%0D%0Awith enmity and malice. He does not perform any Ibaadat. His wish is to harm%0D%0Aothers.%0D%0A%0D%0A[ a r a b i c ]%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) asked, \"Do you know who is a%0D%0Apauper?\" The Sahaaba (RA) replied, 'A pauper is he who does not have a%0D%0ADirham or Dinar (no money) nor has he any wealth'. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlaihi Wasallam) said, \"A pauper in my Ummah is he who comes on the day of%0D%0AQiyaamat with Salah, Fast, Zakaah But has verbally abused someone, unjustly%0D%0Aeaten another person's wealth, hit someone, etc. (for such a person) his%0D%0Agood deeds will be taken and given to the other person. If that person's%0D%0Agood deeds are finished, then his sins will be laden upon him and will be%0D%0Aput in the Hell Fire. (Mishkat 2 pg. 435)%0D%0A%0D%0AA jealous person should ponder upon all these Ahaadith and rid himself of%0D%0Athe evil of jealousy. If he does not, then jealousy can make him stoop to%0D%0Alow levels, to the level of Jadoo and oppressing his brother. Imagine the%0D%0Agrief and anxiety caused through Jadoo. The affected person is oppressed,%0D%0Athus the jealous person is endangering his hereafter. If he only strengthens%0D%0Ahis Imaan on Taqdeer, he could contain himself.%0D%0A%0D%0AHow to save oneself from Jadoo%0D%0AIf a person is affected by witchcraft, it is Sunnah to cure himself. The%0D%0Amethod of cure must be carefully chosen. Many people (Muslims and%0D%0Anon-Muslims) claim they can cure. But one must choose a person who strictly%0D%0Aadheres to the Qur'an and Hadith. One should abstain from going to a%0D%0Anon-Muslim. However, in a case of desperation, if no Muslim is found, he may%0D%0Ago to such a person who does not utter words of Kufr and Shirk. The person%0D%0Awho cures is not any extraordinary person. He is just a Doctor who%0D%0Aspecializes in a specific field. Just as a Doctor could make a mistake in%0D%0Ahis diagnosis, the Aamil too can make a mistake. His words cannot be%0D%0Aregarded as absolutely correct. Whilst treating, if somebody's name comes%0D%0Aout, it is not certain that the person did Jadoo, etc. Similarly, the taweez%0D%0Athe Aanmil gives may be used. The Sahaaba asked Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlaihi Wasallam) about Taweez. He said, 'it is a power from the power of%0D%0AAllah' It is a means of cure, but Allah is the ultimate Shafee (Curer).%0D%0A%0D%0AFinally%0D%0AMany people experience some downfall and quickly jump to the conclusion that%0D%0Asomebody made Jadoo and start casting doubts on different people. Therefore,%0D%0Aone should not be too hasty in concluding that the cause of a problem is%0D%0AJadoo because more often than not, Jadoo has nothing to do with the problem.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah knows best"
