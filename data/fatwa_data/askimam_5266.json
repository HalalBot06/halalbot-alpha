  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Sahib: 1. Is it HALAAL to consume food items which contain the ingredient L-Cystine, that can be derived either synthetically, HUMAN HAIR, and/or Chicken/Duck feathers? 2. Is the financier of a loan based on the concept of Ijara & Diminishing Musharakah, allowed to earn profit, which may equal or exceed the profit earned from an interest bearing loan? 3. If yes, then what is the benefit of obtaining a loan from such an entity, which costs more or less the same as a typical interest bearing loan? 4. What constitutes the permissibility of such a loan in Islam, when in reality the borrower ends up paying more or less the same as with typical interest bearing loan? 5. Does one offers QUSAAR of his/her QADAA-E-UMARI salaat, while traveling to places that are more than 50-miles from his/her place of residence? 6. Is it acceptable to offer one's salaat in a mixed fashion, i.e; perform Qiyaam and Ruku in normal fashion, but perform Sajdah and Tashaud while sitting on a chair, because of physical limitations? 7. Does one HAS to wash the private part after urination, with water using his hands, or simply pouring water over it will suffice? Wa-As-Salaam-O-Alaykum-Wa-Rahmatullahy-Wa-Barakatahoo. Jazakallah-O-Khair, for your prompt response to my questions.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) If the L-Cystine is derived from human hair, then it will not be Halaal.%0D%0AIf it is derived synthetically or from chicken and duck feathers, then it%0D%0Awill be halaal.%0D%0A2) Yes, he is allowed.to make a profit.%0D%0A3) Shariat has sactioned it as permissible for a person to make a profit in%0D%0Aan Ijaarah or Diminishing Musharakah transaction, whereas receiving or%0D%0Apaying of interest is not permissible in Shariat.%0D%0A4) If the Shari laws are abided by and the different transactions which are%0D%0Afound in Ijarah and Dimininshing Musharakah are transacted accordingly, then%0D%0Ait will be permissible. It should also be noted that in an interested based%0D%0Atransaction there is no risky factor of loss in any way which will make this%0D%0Atransaction impermissible. In Ijarah and Diminishing Musharakah there exists%0D%0Athe factor of the financier of lessor losing his investment if any calamity%0D%0Ahas to befall. For more details refer to Mufti Taqi Usmani's book, \"Islamic%0D%0AFinance\".%0D%0A5) This depends on whatever the qadaa salaat which is being performed now,%0D%0Adid it become qadaa while you were on a journey of more than 48 miles or%0D%0Anot. If the qadaa salaat became qadaa on you while you were a musaafir, then%0D%0Ayou will perform qasar of the qadaa salaat. If the qadaa salaat had become%0D%0Aqadaa, that is, at the expiry time of the salaat you were not a musaafir but%0D%0Ayou were a muqeem, then you will perform the full and complete qadaa salaat%0D%0Aeventhoug you are on a journey.%0D%0A6) If a person due to some excuse is unable to perform sajdah on the ground%0D%0Aas normal, thern the ruling is that he is excused from making qiyaam.%0D%0ATherefore he should perform his whole salaat in a sitting position. (Shaami%0D%0Avol.1 pg.445).%0D%0A7) Merely pouring water over it will suffice if complete purity is attained%0D%0Abut one has to remember that 'istibraa' is incumbent on a person. Istibraa%0D%0Ais that a person relieves himself to the extent that he is at total peace of%0D%0Amind that no more droplets of impurity are possible to emerge from his%0D%0Aprivate part. This is ususally done by jerking the private part a little%0D%0Awith the hand.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
