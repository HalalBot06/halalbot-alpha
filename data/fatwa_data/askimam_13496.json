  "answer": "QUESTION\nA lady has a few children. Everytime after giving birth she bled for a few day and then stopped and then thereafterÂ bled for a fews days and then stopped until her period of 40 days ended. She is now about to give birth again. In the previous pregnancies whenever her bleeding stopped she started performing salaat. As soon as her bleeding commenced she stopped and then started reading salaat again when her bleeding stopped again. What should she now do when she gives birth as she is quite certain the pattern will continue . PLEASE ADVISE...may Allah reward you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is mentioned in the books of Fiqh that if someone bleeds in a pulse manner (bleeds for a few days), it will be regarded as though she bled for the entire time. It will not be permissible for her to read Salaat, etc. She should wait until 40 days have passed. (Sharhul Wiqaaya)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
