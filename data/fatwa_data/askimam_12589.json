  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu Alaikkum,I am working in Saudi Arabia. I divorced my wife 10months before, but some imams said, as per tawheed its not valid. Bcos I had sent only one Talaq letter to my wife with written 3 times Talaq (Mutalaq) at the same letter. As per our jamath this is talaq and they finalized. Thats why my parents engaged another bride with my permission. Now my wife recognize all her mistakes and she is ready and she wants to live with me. We have one daughter (17 months old). I also agree to live with her. Now the pblm is my parents are not ready to accept her, bcos, my wife and her mother scold my parents on the street and infront of everybody. This is also one of the reason for my divorce. I have 4 sisters, 2 Still not yet marry. I am the responsible for their marriage. Now if I accept my wife, I am sure my parents will not accept that and they will hate me. But I promised to my wife to accept her and my daughter. In this critical situation what I have to decide. I don't want to loose my parents and my wife. I don't have peace of mind due to this pblms. Please advice me regarding this matter.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBefore issuing you any advice on what you should do regarding reconciling, it is important to point out to you the Shar?ee position of your Nikah. In principle, if you issued your wife three divorces in writing in one letter, that constitutes Talaaq-e-Mughalladha (permanently irrevocable divorce).\n\nIt is not possible for you to reconcile with her without the process of Halaalah. The three written divorces are not considered as one as advised by some Imaams. However, this situation does not prevent you from fulfilling your fatherly duties to your daughter. You should also be favourable to your ex-wife and assist her to the best of your ability. Obviously, you should abstain from all types of intimacy with her.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
