  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am currently employed at a motor dealership, our business is done in a way where we arrange finance from the various local banks which include interest. We also facilitate the signing of the banks contract with the client. The company receives an incentive from the bank which we dispose of seperately. I have been researching on interest and I am unsure of whether or not this way of doing business is halaal or haraam. From what I understand, it is haraam to accept, pay or be witness to interest transactions, does our business become haraam?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nعن جابر قال لعن رسول الله -صلى الله عليه وسلم- آكل الربا وموكله وكاتبه وشاهديه وقال هم سواء.\n\n“Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) cursed the one that accepts interest, gives interest, writes an interest bearing transaction and the witnesses to such transactions and he said: they are all equal (in sin)”(Sahih Muslim, vol 2, pg 27,Rashidiyya)\n\n \n\nThe commentator’s state that the curse mentioned in the above Hadith includes any person that supports and assists an interest bearing transaction. (Fath Al-Bari, vol 4, pg 394, #2085, Qadeemi)\n\nThus, any assistance offered by the motor dealership in obtaining interest bearing finances for its clients will not be permissible. This will also be a form of assisting in sin.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
