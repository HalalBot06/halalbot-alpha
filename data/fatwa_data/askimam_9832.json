  "question": "Is it permissable to have drawings of animals and people in books?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nChildren?s Books. I wish to purchase some books for my 11-month-old daughter and read stories to her. Obviously I wish to teach her stories about Islam. I understand that the storybooks cannot contain real photographs of animals and people. Is it permissible if they contain drawings of animals and people? If permissible then should the books be stored out of sight?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJust as photographs of animate objects are prohibited, drawings of animate objects are also prohibited. Avoid purchasing books with such pictures.\n\nThere are a number of children?s books available in the UK without such pictures. Contact your Islamic bookstore.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
