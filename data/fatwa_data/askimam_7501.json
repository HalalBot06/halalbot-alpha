  "question": "mother x has a son that is sick from birth and is quite old and stayed his whole life with her and she looks after him and has to shave him by his private parts as he can not do it himself",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe advise that growth of the unwanted hair of the disabled son be eliminated by some means.\n\nIf that is not possible, then request a male to remove the unwanted hair. If a male is not available and the unwanted hair is medically harmful, then the mother will be excused for removing the hair. The use of a hair removing cream will be preferred over shaving.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
