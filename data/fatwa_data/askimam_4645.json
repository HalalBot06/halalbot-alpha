  "question": "How to search for a good life partner?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu Alaikum I am worried about my marriage. I know that Allah Taala has a mate for everyone but in one of your answers you have adviced that the person's parents should also search for the mate. My problem is that my parents don't know many people who have sons or who know of other people who of sons who are a marriagable age. Also the proposals I get which are mostly told by my relatives are not appropriate. I am already 21 and still have not received any proposal which will be appropriate for me to get married. I have started to recite Darood 500 times Alhumdulillah. Since my parents dont know many people who can tell them about proposals for me they are not yet searching for my marriage partner. Sometimes I fear that maybe my parents dont know how to search for a husband for me. Would only dua help me in my situation? or do I have to do something also because I know that without doing anything we cannot just get what we want. But I dont know how to search for a marriage partner, and I get worried everyday because I think that my parents also cant search. What should I do. Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis world is Daarul Asbaab (world of means). In order to achieve anything,\none has to adopt means that are permissible in Shari'ah.\n\nIt is our belief that the effect in means is with the order of Allah Ta'ala.\nAt times, people adopt efficient means but are unsuccessful. We, thereforem\nadvise you to adopt means to get married and turn your gaze to Allah Ta'ala\nand make Du'aa to Him to make the adopted means effective.\n\nApart from your parent's effort in searching for a partner for you, you too\nshould inform your friends and relatives to assist you in finding a marriage\npartner. All they will have to do is inform people of you being of\nmarriagable age and interested in marrying. We make Du'aa to Allah Ta'ala\nthat He grant you a suitable marriage partner and grant you peace and\nhappiness, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
