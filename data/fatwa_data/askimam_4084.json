  "question": "During Salaat, while reciting Atthayyat, some people circle their right index finger, throughout. Which is the correct position, please state the mandating Hadith?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAlso, when raising the index finger, a ring is formed with the thumb and the middle finger, should this ring be maintained, even after finishing the Atthayyat? I was told that this was the Sunnah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, the index finger should be raised when\nreciting the 'Laa' in Attahiyyaat and lowering it when reciting Illallaah.\nThe ring should be maintained till the end.\n\nThe continuous movement of the index finger is according to the Maaliki\nMadhab. Both views are substantiated by authentic Ahaadith.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
