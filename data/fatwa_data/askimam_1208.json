  "question": "I read 5-times a day and have friends who drink alcohol and smoke drugs such as dope. They know they are doing wrong, what should I do?, Should I stay with them or let them do what they want?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two aspects here:\nOne is I'elaam (to inform) and the other is I'emaal (to make others\npractice). Informing is merely a means of making others practice. The\npurpose (to make others practice) should be placed first and then wisdom\nshould be applied in trying to achieve the purpose.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
