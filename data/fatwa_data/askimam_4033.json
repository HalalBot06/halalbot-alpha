  "question": "How long or how many times should I try looking for the person wronged by me in order to ask for their forgiveness?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSo far I can't find them online to say sorry and ask for forgiveness. I was speaking to them online and told them I was committing something haraam. It was a joke but they probabaly don't know that. I fear they won't forgive me or they might do wrong becaause of me or get a bad impression of Islam. I think it is one thing asking forgiveness from Allah but what about the person I have wronged. What can I do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nContinue to search for those whom you have wronged for that period of time%0D%0Ain which you are certain that now you definitely won't be able to find them.%0D%0AIf you do find them ask for their forgiveness. However, if on the contrary%0D%0Ayou don't, then you should constantly ask for Allah Ta'ala begging him to%0D%0Aforgive you and them as well.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe understand this from a Hadith of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Awherein he is mentioned to have said regarding those who have made Gheebat%0D%0Aand wish to repent but they can't find those whom they have made Gheebat of%0D%0Aor thy may have died, 'Verily the recompense of Gheebat is to supplicate%0D%0Athus, 'O Allah, forgive us as well as him (the one whose Geebat was made).'%0D%0A(Ma'ariful Qur'aan vol.8 pg.123)%0D%0A%0D%0AAlthough this Hadith infers specifically to Gheebat, we understand that on a%0D%0Abroader spectrum, it could encompass all such situations wherein one has%0D%0Awronged his fellow and cannot locate him. You may also take out some money%0D%0Aas Sadaqah and make the intention that you are giving it on their behalf. In%0D%0Athe instance where you feel you may have created a bad impression of Islam,%0D%0Athen we advise you to make Tawbah (repentance) for this and in future%0D%0Acontinue to promote and propagate Islam in whatever way possible.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
