  "question": "I currently work as a Software tester for a leading wall street foreign exchange trading firm.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSalam waalaiykum, I would like to enquire if my income is halal or not. I currently work as a Software tester for a leading wall street foreign exchange trading firm.\nMy basic function is to test the Back Office software. This software performs all calculations, account setups, and configurations, as well as facilitates the Trading in foreigne xchange.\nMy confusions stems from the fact that it is through this software that the interest that customers pay, earn, and the firm itself pays and earns is calculated. Also, in foreign exchange trading there is a high level of speculation.\nOur custoemrs do have the option to trade on 0 interst and pay commission. This facility has been introduced by the firm for our  muslim clientele.\nHowever, when testing I have to make sure that the software works for all setups.\n\nAm I then in any way part of the interest based transaction, and/or am I in any way as a tester - testing in the TEST environment only - facilitating the haram interest based transactions in any way?\nOr am I external to the trades, since I am only part of testing to make sure that the Programmers correctly implement the requirements laid down by business.\nI get a document that lists the requirements, and I test to make sure that they have been correctly implemented, and that the system works.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAccording to the information provided by you, it will be permissible for you to continue your current employment and the income will be lawful. This is considering the fact that you only test the software used by the firm in a testing environment which would mean that are not directly involved in any of the interest-based transactions executed in foreign exchange trading.\n\n \n\nو على هذا يخرج الاستئجار على المعاصي أنه لا يصح لأنه استئجار على منفعة غير مقدورة الاستيفاء شرعا كاستئجار الإنسان للعب و اللهو و كاستئجار المغنية و النائحة للغناء و النوح بخلاف الاستئجار لكتابة الغناء و النوح أنه جائز لأن الممنوع عنه نفس الغناء\n\n(Badai' Al-Sanai', Vol. 4, P. 39, Darul Kutub Deoband)\n\n(Contemporary Fatawa, P. 159-161, Idara-e-Islamiat)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
