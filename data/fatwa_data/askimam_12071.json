  "question": "Plz explain this verse of the Glorious Quran Surah Maryam; Verse 76",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n[ 19:76 \"And Allah doth advance in guidance those who seek guidance: and the things that endure, Good Deeds, are best in the sight of thy Lord, as rewards, and best in respect of (their) eventual return.\"] One of Imams in my town, told me that 'Good Deeds that endure' or 'Baqeyato Salehato' refers to ONLY those deeds which are 'Pure' or 'Tayaab'. He further explained that pure deeds can only be accepted by ALLAH (SWT) if they have been performed by someone whose flesh has been nourished by Halal Rizq (sustenance). I've been very worried ever since that Tafsir lecture by him. I'm a student and am currently dependant upon my family in terms of expenditure etc. My father deals in some interest-related business transactions. He does NOT earn interest, Alhamdulillah but is PAYING interest to the bank for a loan on a new factory. What would be the condition of any good deeds either he performs, or I perform or any memeber of my family? Would they fall under 'Baqeyato Salehato'? I am very worried. Please guide. Jazak ALLAH Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPaying Interest is Haraam and a sin, however as long as one is not receiving interest and consuming it, it will not have an effect on the acceptance of ones actions.Thus they would fall under Baaqiyaatus Saalihaat, inshallah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
