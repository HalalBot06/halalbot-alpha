  "question": "What is the islamic ruling regarding ibn taimiya? Did he held any anthromorphist belief?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease help me clear some doubts regarding this. Because a lot of islamic scholars quoted his works.But at the same time a lot of islamic scholar denounced his works. Is he ahlus sunnah scholar?What the classical scholars have said about him?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShaykh Taqi-u-ddin Ahmad ibn Taymiyah was a prominent Aalim (scholar) of Deen. Shaykh Taqi-u-ddin had his independent views on many matters based on his vast knowledge and research. It is incorrect for non-scholars and non-academics to pass a judgment especially on such learned people. They should fear Allah and abstain from engaging themselves in such discussions. Differences of opinion is a salient feature among the Ulama-e-Haqq (true scholars).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
