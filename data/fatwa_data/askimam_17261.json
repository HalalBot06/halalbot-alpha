  "question": "Having the Prophets name on a rug in a Masjid",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThe name   محمد  (Mohammad) is written on rugs of a mosque where hundreds of Muslims come to pray every day. Many of them un-knowingly and un-intentionally steps on the respected name. The mosque authorities says that  محمد رسول الله (Mohammad Rasool ul Allah) is not written so there is no harm in having the name محمد (Mohammad) on rugs. The name محمد  could be removed from the rug. I would like to know your opinion on this matter.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is improper to have the name Muhammad on the prayer rugs for two reasons. Firstly it is disrespectful to the name Muhammad. It does not make a difference if Rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wasallam) is not written with Muhammad. It is obvious by Muhammad being printed on the rugs, Rasulullah (salallahu Alayhi wasallam) is meant, or at least ones mind will go to Rasulullah (salallahu Alayhi wasallam).\n\nSecondly, there is a fear of shirk as people will make sajda at the name and the focus could be consumed by the name Muhammad rather than it being on Allah in sajda. Such prayer rugs should be replaced by plain prayer rugs.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalam\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
