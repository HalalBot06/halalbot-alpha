  "question": "Salaah behind a Salafi and Shia",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\niam a hanfi can we pray namaz behind the imam who is other maslak(ex:salfi,shia)..At that time can we say\"tabae imam ke\"that we usually say.. r our namaz is qhabool..If not should we have to pray namaz again..\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIf by maslak (path)you mean salafi and shias, then hereunder is out response.\n\nSalah Behind a Salafi\n\nSalafis are considered to be from the Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah inspite of some of our differences with them on interpretations of some issues of Aqaaid. Salah behind a Salafi will be valid, However, if a Salafi does not wash his feet in wuzu and suffices on wiping (masah) on general nylon and cotton socks the his wuzu is invalid. It is not permissible to perform salah behind such a person.\n\nÂ \n\nSalah Behind a Shia\n\nThere are many groups among Shias. The validity of salah behind a shia depends on the Aqaaid (beliefs) of that Shia. The attached article on Shiaism explains our differences with the mainstream Jafari Shias. Salah behind this group of Shias is not valid. (Please see : http://www.al-inaam.com/fataawa/shia_kafir.htm )\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
