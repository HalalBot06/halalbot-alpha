  "question": "Please explain me the Hadiths mentioned below. Does the Hadiths refer to the Taliban Regime?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAbu Hurairah (R.A.) says that Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) said: \"(Armies carrying) black flags will come from Khurasaan. No power will be able to stop them and they will finally reach Eela (Baitul Maqdas) where they will erect their flags.\"\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nRasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi wa sallam had made many predictions regarding\nQiyaamah. The Hadith quoted is just one of them. This Hadith has to be\nviewed in conjunction with Ahaadith of similar meaning. No one can say for\ncertain that it refers to the Taliban or not.\n\nAs events unfold, one will be able to gauge with more clarity whether the\nHadith does in fact refer to the Taliban or not.\n\nWhether or not they fall under the meaning of this Hadith, the fact is they\nare striving to uphold the Shariah. This is sufficient enough reason for us\nto support them. If, Allah forbid, if they have to turn away from the\nShariah, so too will our support of them turn away.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
