But first time he sad:\" You start to roll this stone and carry out until the end ?He meant due to my love to this brother, I can go to him.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for referring your problem to the institute.%0D%0A%0D%0ASister, Islam is very clear about the relationship between a husband and his wife. Your total allegiance, total loyalty and admiration is for your husband, for this is what helps the ties to bind and the love to grow. You are allowed to admire and love Nabi (sallallaahu alayhi wassallam), the illustrious sahaba and the wonderful women of that era with zeal. We should love them to the extent that we desire to reach their level of piety, modesty, imaan and sacrifice. All of us here on earth presently are but a mere shadow of the previous great scholars and learned elders of Islam. These people were fallible too, yet they earned the respect, love and admiration of millions all over the world due to their modesty and taqwa.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou may recall that we are allowed to make sajdah to Allah Ta'ala only. Our%0D%0Abeloved Nabi (sallallaahu alayhi wassallam) is reported to have mentioned%0D%0Athat in the likelihood that permission was given for sajdah to be made to a%0D%0Ahuman being, then a wife would have been commanded to make sajdah to her%0D%0Ahusband. In our limited understanding we do not realise the gravity of this%0D%0Aconcept. A wife has been granted a husband by Allah Ta'ala's decree. A%0D%0Ahusband has been made the head of the household and it is up to the wife to%0D%0Amake sure she turns that house into a palace and that she becomes it's%0D%0AQueen. Her efforts in every aspect of her life with her husband will help%0D%0Aher realise this status.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala created the institution of marriage and gave you to your%0D%0Ahusband as a most wonderful gift, to love, cherish and treasure. You both%0D%0Aare supposed to derive comfort, solace and pleasure from each other and not%0D%0Aheartache and hurt. Think of it this way. If your husband kept on telling%0D%0Ayou that he admires another woman, that she is most pious and that he%0D%0A'loves' her for that quality, how will you react and respond to this%0D%0Aconstant comparison? Will you not feel that your husband does not appreciate%0D%0Ayou and that he has eyes, ears and possibly heart for another woman and that%0D%0Ahe has discarded you?%0D%0AYou may think your husband is not pious enough, that is a judgement only%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala can make because only He knows what is in our hearts.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou write below, \" he meant due to my Love to this brother, I .............\"%0D%0AWhat do you mean by this? That you do love him? So does this mean that%0D%0Abesides admiration and liking, you also love him? Shaitaan's waswasa have%0D%0Agot to you. Unfortunately, even so-called pious people are also manipulated%0D%0Aby shaitaan to destroy marriages and one's imaan.%0D%0A%0D%0ASister, I suggest that you humbly seek Allah Ta'ala's forgiveness, guidance%0D%0Aand mercy. You need to take stock of your loyaly and fidelity to your%0D%0Ahusband. Allah Ta'ala is most merciful, so seek your husband's forgiveness%0D%0Aand refresh your love for your husband.%0D%0AAll is not lost. You have made a mistake and do your best to make amends.%0D%0AYour husband is most likely very hurt by your open admiration of another%0D%0Aman. You will have to put up with his displeasure till he realises that you%0D%0Aare sincere and loyal to him only. Cut off all ties with this other man.%0D%0ADon't talk to him, look at him or have him in your home at all. Do not talk%0D%0Aabout him at all. As far as you are concerned, he is history.%0D%0AI suggest that you increase your nafl salaah and seek Allah Ta'ala's%0D%0Aguidance and assistance in abundance. Also increase istigfaar, zikr and%0D%0Arecitation of darood so that you can keep shaitaan at bay with Allah%0D%0ATa'ala's help. I strongly suggest that you get an English translation of the%0D%0AHoly Quran so that you can fully appreciate what your life as a Muslim woman%0D%0Ais meant to be like. Allah Ta'ala had strong reasons for commanding all%0D%0AMuslim men and women to abstain from intermingling with the opposite sex.%0D%0AYou are now experiencing the consequences of intermingling since shaitaan is%0D%0Arocking your marriage.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala guide you towards making amends with your husband and%0D%0Aprotect you from the waswasa of shaitaan. Ameen.%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best.%0D%0A%0D%0A1Social department%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
