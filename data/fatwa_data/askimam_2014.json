  "question": "Assalaamualaikum, The Imam in our masjid sometimes joins Zohr and Asr and at times magrib and Isha when there is a little heavy rainfall, what should we do.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nActually once when he did this (joined magrib and Isha) some of us left, but he complained about this in a lecture that we are not following the majority in the masjid, what do we have to do because here in US even if the weather is bad people go out to do grocery and other stuff but for prayers they just join them. What should we do? Should we join the jamat or leave and coming back at the proper time and make another jamat. Jazakallah khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs Hanafis, we should maintain our Salaat at its stipulated times. But for the sake of unity, especially in a growing and diverse country like America, you may join the Imaam for Esha Salaat with the intention of Nafl Salaat and when the time of Esha Salaat sets in, you should perform your Esha Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
