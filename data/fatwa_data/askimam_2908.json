  "question": "If one files for a divorce in USA court. Does it count as 1 talaq or 3?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf the divorce is filed in a USA court and court grants the divorce, is it considered as one divorce such that the husband and wife can re-marry or is it 3 talaaq that they can not re-marry. Please reply ASAP. jazakAllahu Khairan\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the husband instituted divorce through court and it was granted, it will\nbe regarded as only one Talaaq-e-Raj'ee. The husband can revoke the divorce\nwithin the Iddat period.\n\nIf he did not revoke it, the Talaaq will be changed to Talaaq-e-Baain. In\nsuch a situation, a reperformance of Nikah will be necessary. If the wife\ninstituted the divorce through Court, it will not constitute Talaaq.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
