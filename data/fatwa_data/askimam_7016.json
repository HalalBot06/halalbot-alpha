  "question": "Why do SUNNIS not recognise muawiah and other leaders as caliphs as they do with Hazrat Abu Bakr(RA),Omar(RA),Uthman(RA) & Imaam Ali(RA),why does the caliphate stop at Imam Ali?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAfter the demise of Imaam Ali, there were battles against the Family of Muhammed (Saw),e.g Karbala etc, i find it very obscure that that there wasn't a caliph after Ali (RA). I heard that the succsessor to Ali (Ra) was supposed to be one of his sons, and then Yazid,Muawiah etc waged war and there was a power struggle. In our Kutbah we mention the names of the Caliphs and the family of Muhammed (SAW),why do we stop at Ali (RA), i mean, Yazid and Muawiyah were also people of authority, or did the muslims at that time feel that they knew enough, and that they didnt need a leader. In my opinion, i feel that yazid and his father were the perpetrators of the most grusome murder ever in history of mankind. And i am not cursing them, but i object to people who show sympathy and admiration towards them.The prophet (SAW) said and i quote: \"My family are like the arc of Noah, those who board it are saved, and those who don't board it won't be saved\" it is clearly evident from the above quote, that yazid was so far from the right path when he took arms against Imaam Hussain, yet our ulemah are completly oblivios of his malicious a poor character, they will contionously attribute great qualities to Muawiyah and his Son YAZID. I would appreciate your comments to my opinion.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe love for Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and his family is an integral part of our faith. Similarly, the love for every Sahaabi (Radhiallaahu Anhu) is also an integral part of our faith.\n\nHadhrat Mu?aawiya (Radhiallaahu Anhu) was a great and illustrious Sahaabi of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Kindly refer attached, ?Muawiya?. The information about him and his son Yazid regarding Karbala is based on historical factors and clouded with animosity and misunderstandings.\n\nIt is, therefore, best to remain silent and not to comment on such issues. We will not be questioned by Allah Ta?ala on the day of Qiyaamat about the actions of others.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
