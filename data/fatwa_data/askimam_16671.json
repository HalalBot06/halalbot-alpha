  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni need to know \"whether the recitation of the sura ya-sin  for a death person (janaza) is beneficial to that person (the niyat is for the deceased person) or to the person who is reading it or for both? your urgent response in this matter will be greatly appreciated.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nTo perform a virtuous act and grant the reward to another person is known as Isaal-e-Thawaab and is a (Mustahabb) meritorious act. When making Isaal-e-Thawaab to the deceased, the deceased gets the reward and the person making Isaal-e-Thawab also gets the reward.\n\n(Fatawa Mahmoodiyah Vol.9 Pg.206 – Jami’ah Farooqiyah)\n\nReading Surah Yaseen and conveying the rewards to a deceased is also a form of Isaal-e-Thawab. Hence, the deceased as well as the person reading Surah Yaseen will be rewarded.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
