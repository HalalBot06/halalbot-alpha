  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaikum i would like to know whether there is a ruling regarding wishing Christians well over christmas and Hindus well over diwali? i have read some where that this is forbidden as you are confirming their faith. So can we wish them well..or is it haraam?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible to wish non-Muslims during their festivals.\n\nThe non-Muslims display acts of Kufr during their festivals. To wish them in\ntheir festivals is a sign of complacency to Kufr.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
