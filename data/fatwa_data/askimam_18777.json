However, due to the great distance between the two of you (knowing that physical contact is impossible), it would be advisable not to view each other naked as this will lead to arousal, which will then create the urge to masturbate and  masturbation is prohibited.[1]        \n\n (Radul Muhtār)\n\n2) Regarding licking the private part of a spouse or oral sex; one should bear in mind that Allāh Ta ̒āla has created the mouth as a favour to man for Allāh's remembrance. Thus, the mouth is used to eat, make Thikr and reciting the Holy Qurān. These are all pure actions. To use the mouth for a lowly act, such as licking a private part, is inappropriate and should not be practiced.[2]\n\n(Hindiyah vol.5 pg. 372  Rashidiyah)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl. Zakariyya bin Ahmed,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā\n\n\n\n\nقوله ( الاستمناء حرام ) أي بالكف إذا كان لاستجلاب الشهوة[1]\n\n \n\n[2] إذا أدخل الرجل ذكره في فم امرأته قد قيل يكره كذا في الذخيرة"
