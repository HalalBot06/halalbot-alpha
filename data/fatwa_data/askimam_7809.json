  "answer": "QUESTION\nI wanted to ask for your advice. I had a dream the other night and since then I was unable to sleep properly for a couple of nights. The dream was about a spider-well I thought it was a spider but then it seemed to be more like a scorpion and it was chasing me but I managed get away from it by locking myself in a car (that belonged to my uncle). The spider/scorpion was very black and big too. Then eventually it hid somewhere and I couldn?t see it for a bit and then it came out again. I remember seeing members of my family in the car with me (girl cousin and aunt). I became quite concerned about the dream so I mentioned it to a close friend and she said it was a good dream. Can you tell me if there is anything more to it? Does it even mean anything? Or is it just in my mind? I would be grateful if you could advise me appropriately.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA scorpion is a harmful creature. The fact that you took refuge in a car and the scorpion did not harm you, is a good indication.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
