  "question": "permissible for adults or children to wear a baseball cap while playing sports",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI was wondering if it is permissible for adults or children to wear a baseball cap while playing sports. Or is this emmulation of the kuffar.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe objective of wearing a cap is to protect the face or head from sunshine. It would be permissible to wear any type of cap for such protection.\n\nHowever, most youngsters today don a baseball cap in emulation of their western counterparts. The fact that it is worn outside as well as indoors is a clear indication that it is not worn for protection from sunlight. Considering the factor of emulation, baseball caps should be avoided.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
