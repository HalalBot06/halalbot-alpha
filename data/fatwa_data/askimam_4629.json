  "question": "If our partners for marriage are predetermined by Allah Taâ€™ala, then why do we recite the 500 durood for marriage?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTaqdeer (predestination) simply means that everything is within Divine\nmeasure and is in the complete and absolute knowledge of Allah Ta'ala.\nHowever, this world is Daarul Asbaab (world of means and effect). We have to\nadopt means to achieve anything.\n\nA person's children are predetermined but he has to adopt a means to have\nchildren by marrying. A person's sustenance is predetermined but a person\nhas to go out in search of his sustenance. Taqdeer and adopting means are\nnot inconsistent to one another. It is our belief that the effect in our\nmeans will be according to whatever was in the absolute knowledge of Allah\nTa'ala - Taqdeer. Reciting 500 times Durood is similar to adopting effective\nmeans to achieve one's objective. The reciting of Durood 500 times has been\nproven to be an effective means to get a suitable marriage partner, but the\nmarriage partner will be ultimately according to Taqdeer.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Know"
