And lastly mufti sahb how did you get this great idea to start yhis website.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) There are many radio stations with the name Radio Islam, in many different countries. We cannot comment on them as we are unsure of which radio station you are referring to. A simple method to gauge whether a radio station conforms to Shariah or not is to see whether they play music, hold unislamic discussions, allow live flirting between males and females and show pictures of animate objects on their advertising material, website etc. If they perpetrate any of these wrongs, then you would be advised to seek elsewhere for an Islamic radio station.%0D%0A%0D%0A2) While the Khutbah also gives the benefit of being a \"speech \", the name object behind it is to remember Allah i.e. the Zikr of Allah. This can be deduced from the fact that Allah Ta'ala called the Khutbah \"zikr\" and not \"a speech\" in the Quran. Also, Sahabah (radhiallahu anhum) conquered numerous countries the inhabitants of which didn't understand Arabic, yet inspite of this and in spite of the fact that there was such a great need to teach these new Muslims, the Sahabah (radhiallahu anhum) never gave the Khutbah in any language except arabic. Ask this brother to furnish authentic proof showing that the Khutbah was given in any other language but Arabic by the Sahabah in these lands!%0D%0A%0D%0A3) One should make Zikr of Laa ilaha Illallah. When saying Laa picture yourself removing everything but Allah from the heart and when you say Illallah, picture Allah Ta'ala coming into your heart. Mashaikh advise making this Zikr 100 times daily for beginners. You would also be advised to adopt the company of a pious person whose actions and statements conform to the Shariah.%0D%0A%0D%0A4) You should think of all the sins that you have committed and tell yourself that each one of these sins are sufficient for Allah to punish me for them, while every other person has some good in him and it is possible that on the basis of that good in him, Allah Ta'ala could forgive him and even convert all his sins to good deeds! If you see a brother doing a wrong, then you should tell yourself that he has an excuse for it and you should think up a possible reason why he has done this wrong. If you are unable to find any reason, then you should chastise yourself saying, \"My brother has an excuse, yet I am so bad, that I cannot even think of it!\" %0D%0A%0D%0A5) We would strongly recommend to you the books of Moulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi as well as the books of any of the other illustrious Ulama of Deoband. Madrasah Arabia Islamia in Azadville could be contacted for a detailed list of the authentic and reliable books they have available. Their email address is: darululum%40webmail.co.za.%0D%0A%0D%0A6) The first Muslims are said to have come to South Africa some 315 years ago as prisoners of the Dutch from Malaysia. They underwent untold difficulties in practising their religion, until Allah Ta'ala opened up the way for them. Many other from Malaysia followed and around 150 years ago Indian were brought to South Africa to work as indentured labourers in the sugarcane fields. Many stayed behind and were followed by others who came to South Africa to open businesses. Thus the two major portions of the South African Muslim community are the Malays and the Indians.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
