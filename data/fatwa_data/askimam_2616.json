Jazakom Allah Khairan\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0AQ: Are contraceptions permissible?%0D%0AA: Contraception (Azl) is permissible on a limited scale for valid reasons -%0D%0Areasons considered by the Shari%E1h to be valid. The circumstances which will%0D%0Apermit reversible and permanent contraception differ.%0D%0AReversible contraception: Among the reasons accepted by the Shari%E1h as valid%0D%0Afor practising reversible contraception are: a) Physical weakness.b)%0D%0ASickness.c) The wife maintaining her beauty or figure for the sake of her%0D%0Ahusband. d) The couple being on a journey or in a distant land. e) Adverse%0D%0Apolitical conditions, e.g. children are forcibly separated from their%0D%0Aparents as is advocated by communism; etc. f) The couple decide to separate%0D%0Ain the near future. g) The wife is an immoral person.%0D%0AThere are valid grounds for practising reversible contraception. Poverty or%0D%0Athe fear of poverty are not valid reasons for contraception. It is not%0D%0Apermissible to practice contraception on account of a fear of not being able%0D%0Ato provide for a large family. Such a fear is an attribute of non-Muslims.%0D%0AAccording to the Qur%E3n Shareef: 'There is not a living creature, but its%0D%0Asustenance is the responsibility of Allah.' Similarly desire to curb sexual%0D%0Adesire which may stem out of piety is not a lawful ground for contraception.%0D%0AIf practised for any reason which is unlawful in Islam, then contraception%0D%0Awill likewise be unlawful, e.g. for indulgence in illicit sex.%0D%0APermanent contraception is permissible only if the woman's life is in danger%0D%0Aor her health is seriously threatened.%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Sa%E9ed Khudhry (RA) reports that one person asked Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) about Azal (Coitus Interruptus). Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) replied, 'When Allah Ta%E3la intends creating a%0D%0Achild, nothing can stop him.'
