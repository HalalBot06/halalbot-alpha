  "question": "Would buying a Ferrari (super car manufacturer) constitute sin?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1.Would buying a Ferrari (super car manufacturer) constitute sin? Alhumdulillah; Allah has granted me understanding and so I am able to spend a lot of wealth (anonymously) in the path of Allah via varying avenues for example charity, and subsidising costs towards masjids etc. I acknowledge buying a Ferrari is perhaps fazail-kurch; so is fazail-kurch haraam; disliked or what? (I probably am not spelling/understanding the concept correctly, its something I learnt of whilst in Tabligh Jamat, please try to improvise).\n\n \n\n2. If one’s intention is to keep physically fit for the sake of Allah, maybe for Jihad, then would it be a good deed?\n\n \n\n3. Alhumdulillah I have a full beard; pray 5 times and I am decent looking but still I don’t seem to get marriage proposals from PIOUS women. What would you advise I do in terms of du’a or something to at least get some decent proposals? I don’t actually have any contacts with or know any women who are pious that I could propose to.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah Taa’la has bestowed us with wealth. This is a blessing of Allah upon which we should always express our gratitude and Shukr. Allah states \"If you are grateful, I will increase my blessings upon you and if you are ungrateful my punishment is severe\". The are two ways of expressing Shukr and gratitude. One is verbally and the other practical. Verbal will mean to say thank you or Shukr to Allah with the mouth. Practical would mean the wealth Allah has blessed you with, to use it in a correct manner fulfilling all the rights that are attached to it. Extravagance, wastage, etc. are all signs of ingratitude to the favours of Allah. Allah likens those who waste and are extravagant to the brothers of Shaytaan.\n\nNevertheless, owning a Ferrari motorcar is generally a sign to show ones richness and status. Sometimes owning a Ferrari now gives license to the owner to secure his place in the category of the super rich and elite. If the Ferrari is bought with this intention, it is not permissible as this will be tantamount to extravagance and will become a source of pride which is Haraam.\n\nHowever, if the Ferrari is bought for investment purposes and the intention is solely to resell it on a profit, then it will be permissible to purchase it.\n\n2) In order to remain fit, the Ahadith of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] encourage swimming, horse riding and archery. It is encouraged to remain fit by doing one of these sports.\n\n3) If there are no proposals coming for you, you should approach parents who have suitable girls to marry. Sometimes, parents who have daughters to marry do not approach men, as they fell that is below their dignity and will harbor ill thoughts in the minds of their daughter about them. Therefore, you should enquire from people who have daughters of marriageable age and propose to marry if you think them to appropriate for you.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
