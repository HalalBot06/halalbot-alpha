  "answer": "QUESTION\nWomen in Islam is permitted to Breastfeed the child for 2 years if in this period she conceives her breast milk will stop and the Haq of the first child will be deprived. What is the procedure in Islam to have intercourse with ones wife during that period of 2 years as it will be very difficult for a husband & a wife to controll their feelings. Is it permitted for a Husband or a wife to use condoms during that period of breast feeding or is there some other procedure to have intercourse. Please explain in details\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThis is no new issue. In fact, even during the time of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), such issues of importance were well explained. It was the Arab custom to abstain from intercourse whilst the wife is breastfeeding because they feared that this may cause harm to the child.\n\nIt is reported that Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was about to prohibit such an action due to its harms, but thereafter he saw the Romans and Persians did the same and there was no harm at all. The companions ( Radhiallaahu Anhum ) thereupon asked Nabi ( Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam ) for permission to do Azl, which in contemporary terms, refers to withdrawal. The equivalent of which is temporary contraception. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) expressed his displeasure at this since this was not the conviction of a true believer. (Mirqaat vol.6 pg.238).\n\nNevertheless, our conviction should be only on Allah Ta’ala alone. Allah Ta’ala can do with, without and even against all means. Thereafter, if the husband and wife fear that intercourse during the breastfeeding period will be detrimental to the child, then it is permissible to use condoms.
