  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy finace and I are both divorced and living in usa. I am reverted american and he is Pakistani. We want to make a secret nikah now, annoucing only to people here at the masjid. My question is, if we make nikah now, to keep from saying or doing haram, can we make another nikah in Pakistan with his family present? Also the marriage in Pakistan will give us legal papers that we can file later. He is worried that it will be a sin for us to make nikah 2 times. I didn't find any fatwah on this, so can you please advise?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nThe first secret Nikah will be the official Nikah and legitimise the relationship as a husband and wife.\n\n \n\n \n\nThe second Nikah would only serve to satisfy the husbands’ family. What would you do if you conceive after the first secret Nikah? What would you tell people and his family?\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
