  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)Today while I was out shopping on my own (I was in hijaab and burqah), a brother approached me; He asked me questions such as my nationality and if I spoke his language (Arabic). Innocently I answered him thinking that he was looking for something but because he did not speak the language (English) he didn?t know how to ask the shopkeeper something. But then he asked my age and if I lived in the area and out of politeness I answered him. He asked if I was married and if I could take his number and give it to my dad so that he could speak with him about marrying me. I refused. He then asked what mosque my dad attended and that at jumuah salah on Friday he would approach my dad if he saw him. Many hours later I am thinking that what I did was wrong. Please advise me on whether I was right or wrong in what I did and what I should have done in that situation or what I should do if this situation arises again. 2) Do u know any websites that give detailed description of how a woman should pray, jazak Allah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It was incorrect of you to converse with this stranger. Your conversation was unnecessary, hence, prohibited. Should this situation arise in future, refuse to be drawn into conversation by declining to speak from the very beginning.\n\n2.
