  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSharing a residence with a brother knowing that the house is on interest payment yet there is a better chance to success in finding a spouse for myself and saving money. How much should be contributed to charity to avoid this wrath of Allah and his angles in this case?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf you are merely staying in a house that was purchased through an interest bearing deal, then you are not responsible for the sin of interest being paid for that residence.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
