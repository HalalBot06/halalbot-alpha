  "question": "The Sahabah who used to wear leather socks, did they also wear shoes on top, or did their “socks” serve them as shoes? Please quote a few valid instances with the answer.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nFor those who did wore shoes, were the shoes like the modern day one?s which are completely covered?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn the Ahaadith narrated by Imaam Tirmidhi (RA) in his Shamaail, description%0D%0Ais given of the shoes of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Ibn Abbaas%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah's (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Ashoe had two durable traps.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another Hadith narrated by Ubayd ibn Jurayhi (Radhiallaahu Anhu), he%0D%0Asays, 'I asked ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) the reason for not wearing shoes%0D%0Awith hair on them.' He replied, 'I had seen Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) wear and perform Wudhu with shoes that did not have hair on them.%0D%0AThat is why I also like this type of shoes.' Hadhrat Shaykh (RA) explains in%0D%0Ahis commentary, 'In the above Hadith, it is also stated that Wudhu was%0D%0Aperformed with these shoes. The reason being, at that time in Arabia, the%0D%0Ashoes did not have an upper part. They were made of soles with two straps on%0D%0Athem. It was, therefore, possible to perform Wudhu with this type of shoes%0D%0Awhere the feet could be washed without any inconvenience. For this reasom%0D%0ASayyidina (Radhiallaahu Anhu) sometimes, to show that it was permissible,%0D%0Adid this.' (Shamaail Tirmidhi)%0D%0A%0D%0AAbu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) says that the shoes of Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) had two straps. In the same manner, the shoes%0D%0Aof Abu Bakr and Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhuma) also had two straps on them.%0D%0AUthmaan (Radhiallaahu Anhu) began the use of one strap. Sayyiduna Uthmaan%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhu) may have adopted the use of one strap so that it may not%0D%0Abe assumed that two straps are strictly necessary.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs for the Khuff (leather socks) of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam), Imaam Tirmidhi has narrated a Hadith that Buraydah (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhu) says, 'Najjaashiy sent two simple black coloured Khuffs as a gift to%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). He wore these and made Masah over%0D%0Athem after performing Wudhu. (Shamaail Tirmidhi)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
