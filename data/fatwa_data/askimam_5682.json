  "question": "What is the inner core of DUAA.and what is the place of presenting Hajat in Allah`s bargah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMufti sahib, most of the times my DUASS got acceptance....I feel so secure but at the same time my heart says that that kind of acceptance is not that good, and i feel that i am going towards my hearts desires, iam asking and praying only to get this world....and i feel i donot have anything...any good thing(naike) for akhrat.This feeling is so annoying....so disturbing....AT the same time,i presented one of my great Haajat in Allah`s darbar....But I am afraid that i asked so much from my Allah.....Will Allah grant me such satisfaction that i will satisfied with my present being,but Mufti sahib.... at the same time, i cannot let my heart be satisfied with my present conditions.I performed Saalat Tauba every night from a month, and i feel great change in my personality, but what can i do with my dissatisfaction, why i cannot cope with negative feelings.Will Allah forgive me for all this confusing attitutes?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Ask Allah for Aafiyah\n(goodness).'\n\nYour Du'aas being accepted and you being granted your wishes is Aafiyah from\nAllah. If Allah did not want to grant you your wishes, nobody can force\nAllah. Upon being granted your wishes, nobody can force Allah. Upon being\ngranted your wishes, you should make Shukr (grateful) and for that you will\nbe further rewarded by Allah Ta'ala in the hereafter. There is no reason for\nyou to be dissatisfied. That feeling is due to a misconception. Allah Ta'ala\nsays, 'If you make Shukr, I will increase my favours upon you.'\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
