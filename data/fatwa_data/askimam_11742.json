  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is the ruling on making duwa (suplication)in a congression lead by the Imam straight after Jamat prayers? Was it a sunnah of prophet SAW? Is it advisable for us do or is it better for us to make duwa individually?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMaking du'aa after every Salaat without thinking it to be necessary is permissible. Loud du'aa is permissible, however, silent du'aa is preferred. If loud du'aa is taken by the people to be necessary, then they should be educated.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
