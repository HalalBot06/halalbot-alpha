  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat advice could Mufti Saheb give us with regards to a timetable, the best times to study, how we should make time for ibadah and studying. please remember me in your special duas! and may Allah Ta Ala shower you with His infinite Mercy and Blessings for providing this online service!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIslam is a complete way of life that has shown us how to carry out day to day activities throughout the year, at every given moment, time and circumstance. The month of Ramadhan is a very special month for every Muslim. A month which earns the unlimited blessings and mercy of Allah Ta?ala and a month which multiplies the reward of every deed manifold. It is for this reason that we are encouraged to exert ourselves more in the worship of Allah Ta?ala in this month than in other months of the year.%0D%0A%0D%0AAll at the same time, Islam did not shun away or condemn one from his normal daily pursuits, be it in the form of studies, business or anything else. This year, most students of primary and high schools, universities and colleges will be writing their final exams at a time which coincides with Ramadhaan. It is, therefore, essential for students especially to understand and be aware and fully prepared for the situation.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe must understand that we are Muslims first and then we are students. Our sole aim and target should be to reap maximum benefit from this glorious month. In order for us to increase our worship and to exert ourselves more during this month, we cannot afford to let the students distract us from our Ibaadaat (worship). Therefore, we have to plan and prepare ourselves from now.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe month of Ramadhan will also be fairly hot, therefore, to increase our worship and to concentrate on studies will not be an easy task. It is, therefore, our advice to all students to start studying for their examinations now, immediately before Ramadhaan. It will be foolish especially knowing that the examinations will be in Ramadhaan, to do ?last minute standing?. Hence, the first and most important thing to do will be to leave as little work as possible for the month of Ramadhaan, by exerting ourselves to our studies immediately.%0D%0A%0D%0ASecondly, in order for one to value and reap maximum benefit from every moment of Ramadhaan, it is essential to draw up a timetable to plan and prepare ourselves for this month, at the same time, not forgetting the examinations. Concentrating over the examination papers during the hot day, together with fasting and thereafter standing at night in Taraweeh will certainly tire a person tremendously. Therefore, we should ensure that we sleep early at nights, immediately after the Taraweeh Salat.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe may set aside about twenty minutes after the Fajr Salaat, to start off the day with our daily recitation of the Qur?aan including Surah Yaaseen. Thereafter, we may practice the Dhikr of Allah Ta?ala for a short while after which if one feels fresh, he can get down to a ?serious study period? of at least forty five minutes. This will be an ideal time to study, since one is fresh and it is still cool. Moreso, after forty five minutes of studying this will automatically lead one to the time for Salaatul Ishraaq. What greater benefit can there be especially in our (examination) situation. Four Rakaats after sunrise makes a person?s work for the day easy for him. After this, depending on the nature of the examination subject and the commencing time, one will still get two full comfortable hours of sleep.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is also of vital importance to rest and relax the mind properly after the examination proper. After Dhuhr, it will be quite hot, generally. However, there is ample time (approximately four solid hours). One may study in the latter portion of these four hours since it will be much more cooler, hence, it will be advisable to engage in some form of worship (Nawaafil, Tasbeehaat, Du?aa, etc.) immediately after Dhuhr Salaat for a short while (approximately 15 ? 20 minutes). Thereafter, rest again and wake up leaving ample time to have a full study session before Asr Salaat. The time between Asr and Maghrib should be left solely for the worship of Allah Ta?ala. This is a very blessed time. Therefore, one should preferably occupy this time with recitation of the Qur?aan. The last 15 minutes of this time prior to Iftaar can be allocated for Du?aa.%0D%0A%0D%0AAfter Maghrib and supper, it will be best to recite the Masnoon Surahs, Waaqi?ah, Tabaarak, etc. and thereafter prepare for Taraweeh.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
