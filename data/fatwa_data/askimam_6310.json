  "question": "Allaho rabbo Mohammadin Salla alayhe wasallama, nahano ebado Mohammadin salla alayhe wasallama ... This dua could have a meaning of shirk and should be avoided ??",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease let me know the meaning of this darood 1) Allaho rabbo Mohammadin Salla alayhe wasallama, nahano ebado Mohammadin salla alayhe wasallama. I had asked about the above mentioned durud to Jamiatul Ulama. They said: The meaning is \"O Allah, the Lord of Muhammad (peace and salutations be upon him), we are the slaves of Muhammad (Peace be upon him).\" This dua could have a meaning of shirk and should be avoided. I told this to my mother, she said that there's nothing wrong in calling ourselves slaves of Mohammad SAW. I told her that the from the word \"ebado\", I think it means we worship Mohammad SAW. Then she said that yes we do, I was so shocked because we worship only Allah, she said by reciting durud shareef we worship him. I am very disturbed from this remark. I believe in Hadith, I believe he is sent by Allah as Rasool, but I don't think that inspite of the high position he has been given by Allah, we are allowed to worship him. My family thinks that the person who translated the durud shareef is a wahabi. That is their reply to anything I tell them. Please do explain this predicament to me and also tell me are you sunni or wahabi?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe answer by the Jamiat is correct and should be practiced upon. We are the\n'servants of Allah and the followers of Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam)'.\n\nBy sending Durood on Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), we are invoking\nAllah and to send salutations and blessings on Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam). We are not worshipping him, 'Laa ilaaha illallaah' in our Kalimah\nmeans there is none worthy of worship besides Allah. We are the followers of\nthe Ahlus sunnah Wal Jamaa`\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
