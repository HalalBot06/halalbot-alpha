  "question": "my periods stopped just before ramadan then started again, but the colour was brown, do i have to keep fasts again?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy periods Stopped a day before ramadan, I think. I kept 3 fasts but on the third fast realised for sure I was still on my periods, because the discharge was dark brown, on this day it had been my ninth day of period, but the night before I found some blood, well I thought it was but then I gave it the benefit of the doubt because I thought it was just the colour of the toilet tissue, still continuing to fast but I am not praying. Is this my period? 1.Do I keep qaza of fasts? Do I keep qaza of prayers? 2. in shariah is a woman forced to wear purdah, or is it her choice to wear it (full face covered and everything) 3. my friend said that if a woman does purdah, Allah will personally come and see her in jannah, is this true? And also what are the virtues of wearing purdah, I know that it protects the women in this world from rape.etc but what other benefits and rewards are there in the akhirah, 4.is there any alternative banks that don?t give interest, in the UK\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If you have a normal cycle and this month as well it stopped at that cycle and then started again later, then if this new bleeding continues after the tenth day of your menses, then this new bleeding is istihaazha i.e. your fasting, salah etc was valid during that time and if you missed salah or fasting, qadha will have to be made. If this bleeding stopped at ten days or less, then it is part of your haidh(menses) ie.you will have to make qadha of the fasts of all those days, however no need to make qadha of the salawaat. If you never had a set monthly cycle, then if this bleeding stopped at tens days or less, then the entire amount is haidh. If it continued after ten days, then check the number of days you bled the previous month. That number of days would be haidh and the extra bleeding would be istihaazah. (Behisti Zewar Pg.98-100)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. It is compulsory for every woman to wear purdah. If she refuses to wear it, it is the responsibility of her husband or father to ensure that she does wear it.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. We are unaware of any basis for this, however a woman adopting purdah would be rewarded by Allah Ta'ala for every second of it. Not only is she protecting herself and her chastity, but she is also aiding in protecting the moral framework of the society. The true reward for this she will only see when her eyes close.%0D%0A%0D%0A4.We are unaware of any such institutes in the U.K. We would advise you to contact your local Ulama council and ask them%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMl.
