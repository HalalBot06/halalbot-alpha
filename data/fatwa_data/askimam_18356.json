  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am in receipt of a document you forwarded that claims that Nikab is Fard. ( HERE )\nI disagree.\nThe Prophet SAW informed us that the face of a woman is not a part of her awrah, and neither are her hands nor her voice (provided she does not speak with the intention to seduce.)\nThere is to my knowledge no order for anyone other than the wives of the Prophet to observe Nikab, and they are the mothers of the believers and no women are like them.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAlthough this issue has been explained in detail in the Arabic references provided in the footnotes, we have nevertheless explained it briefly below in case you are holding your view without even understanding Arabic.\n\nThere is a difference between covering awrah and covering the face.\n\nThe awrah of a man is from below his navel to below his knees. The awrah of a woman is her entire body except hands, face and feet.\n\nCovering the awrah form part of the nature of human. When Sayyiduna Adam and Hawwa عليهما السلام descended on earth, they immediately began covering their awrah. For this reason covering the awrah was fardh from the very beginning of Islam whilst the laws of hijab were only revealed in the third or fifth year (according to different narrations) after hijrah.\nIt is fardh to cover the awrah, irrespective of whether a person is in seclusion or in public.\nCovering the awrah is fardh on men and women whilst the laws of hijab are exclusive to women.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
