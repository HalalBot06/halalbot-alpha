  "question": "Is it permissible to host a 'Bismillah' or 'Ameen' for a child?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it permissible to celebrate a 'Bismillah' upon the birth of a child or an 'Ameen' upon completion of the Qur'an by a child. I am aware that this is commonly done in the Indo-Pak culture, and would like to know if it is Islamically permissible or bidaa'h?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBirth of a child is indeed a happy occasion. To celebrate this occasion within the boundaries of the Shari?ah is not prohibited.\n\nSimilarly, completion of the Qur?aan is a great achievement. These occasions may be celebrated strictly within the confines of the Shari?ah. We are unaware of the custom of Bismillah. Kindly explain what is this custom.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
