  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nif the imam make some mistake in farz salat and the muqtadi correct him in salat..and imam is not hafiz while muqtadi is hafiz..but the imam gets mad..he dont want anyone to correct him in salat..can u pray behind that person..\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nDespite the incorrect behaviour of the imam, it will still be permissible to perform Salaah behind this imam.\n\nAs a long term strategy, the trustees of the Musjid should investigate thoroughly, and only appoint such a person as imam who has the prerequisite qualities of an imam. One quality would be that he should be able to recite the Qur’aan correctly. Another quality would be forbearance and humility.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala knows best.\n\nWas Salaam\n\nMl. E. Vawda\nfor Daarul Iftaa"
