  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow can Shaytan bother a Muslim in prayer if we read \"outhu billahi minash-Shaytan-nirajeem\" before we commence? I'm not doubting anything, but just want to understand how it all works. Jazakum'Allahu khairun.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA?oodhu billah is merely a Du?aa. The recitation of this Du?aa does not necessarily mean Shaytaan won?t bother him. He is merely begging Allah to protect him from Shaytaan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
