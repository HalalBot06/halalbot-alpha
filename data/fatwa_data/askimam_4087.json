  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssak mufti saheb Pl. Answer my following questions Jazakallah khair 1. My family had taken loan with interest and now we came to know that there is a strong wayeed on this and Allah and Allah?s messenger SAW has strictly warned about this. My question is How should we go about it now. We had a plan of paying few thousand rupees every month we do not have so much of money to pay at once and clear. And according to the contract we had to pay for two years and it was a very very bad situation where we were very badly in need of money and no one was helping us at that time. We have asked for Allah?s repentances and asking that may Allah make the means for us to come out of this lanat and may Allah save every Muslim brothers and sisters from this. 1.Shall we pay the amount as per the contract 2. Even though it was a muslim corporation but they charged us very heavy interest rate. Is it gunaah if we omit the interest and give him the actual. 3. Please show us any dua which let us out from this and keep us safe from any further acts of sin in this regard 4.We want to come out of this ASAP. Please pray for us\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo deal in interest is expressly prohibited in the Qur'aan. The warnings for\ndealing in interest are severe.\n\nDealing in interest invokes the curse of Allah Ta'ala and is also tantamount\nto engaging in war with Allah Ta'ala and His Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam). Therefore, your decision to come out of the interest deal is\ncorrect. If you cannot pay out the loan at once, then you may abide by the\ncontract. You should also make sincere Tawbah and a firm intention never to\ndeal in interest again.\n\nWe do not understand point 2 of your query.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
