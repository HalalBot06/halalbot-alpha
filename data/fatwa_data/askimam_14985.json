  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs there any ruling which prohibits or discourages making salaah on a wet surface, assuming that the surface is pure.\n\nFor example, on a journey I sometimes have to make salaah in the rain. Although this is on a prayer-mat, my clothes and the mat get wet. Is this a problem?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe salah performed on a wet surface, for example, in rain is valid.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
