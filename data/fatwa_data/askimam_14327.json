  "question": "is a Muslim Man required to write divorce or say divorce to a Non-Muslim Wife for the divorce to take place?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nis a Muslim Man required to write divorce or say divorce to a Non-Muslim Wife for the divorce to take place? Or, can he just have two witnesses and this be a Islamic divorce without ever saying talqeel to wife 3 times?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nA Muslim man can have only a Christian or Jewish wife from non-Muslims. He cannot have any other non-Muslim wife. If a Muslim wishes to divorce his non-Muslim christian or Jewish wife, the procedure is the same as divorcing a Muslim wife. He has to verbally pronounce divorce to his non-Muslim Christian or Jewish wife. It is not necessary to pronounce three divorces for the divorces to be valid. One Talaaq is sufficient.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
