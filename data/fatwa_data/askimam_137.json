  "question": "I married a Christian woman. Is it lawful?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for a Muslim female to marry a non-Muslim male.%0D%0AHowever, a Muslim male may marry only a Christian or Jewish female. It is%0D%0Anot permissible for a Muslim male to marry any other non-Muslim female.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is obvious that there are many things a male can do, which is not easily%0D%0Apossible for a female and vice versa. Islam has taken into consideration the%0D%0Amasculine and feminine strength and weaknesses respectively. There is a%0D%0Apossibility of the non-Muslim male due to his masculine powers convincing%0D%0Ahis Muslim wife into abandoning Islam. Therefore, Islam has considered her%0D%0Afeminine nature and protected her correct beliefs by prohibiting her%0D%0Amarrying a non-Muslim.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Muslim husband is not obliged to pressurise his Christian%2FJewish wife to%0D%0Aaccept Islam. He may apply wisdom and diplomacy and only influence her to%0D%0AIslam.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn Islam, a female is equally respected as a male, however, due to the%0D%0Adifferent masculine and feminine natures, Islam believes in separation of%0D%0Aroles.%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
