  "question": "Emulsifiers from Europe, U.S., and Africa",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIt will be a great help if Jamiat can update their readers with the changing E numbers for Europe and states.For many people like myself it is very difficult to get the updated information about the halal E numbers. Please is there a possibility of me getting updated information from you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe emulsifiers used by the European countries bearing the E numbers are\ndifferent to the products manufactured in South Africa. The E numbers\nappearing on the local products have no definite definition i.e. one company\ndefines E 471 to contain a plant base whilst another company defines E 471\nto contain animal base. These are approximately 700+- emulsifiers on the\nmarket of which half are animal based and half are plant based.\n\nHowever, the overseas products with E numbers correspond to the products\nmanufactured in European countries.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti E Desai\nFatwa Dept."
