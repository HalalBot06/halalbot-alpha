  "question": "Is it Fardh, Sunnah or Mustahab to take permission from Ameer - We all brothers of Tableghi Jamat",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespectable Mufti Sahb Assalam-O-Alaikum. I am involved in the work of Dawat-O-Tablegh by the grace of Allah. We all brothers of Tableghi Jamat almost every day gather together after Asar prayer and then we go to meet our other Muslim brothers for Dawat till Maghrib prayer. Then again after Isha prayer Taleem of Fazaail-e-Amal is performed and after this we do Mashwara. So it get very delayed. I can?t sit after Isha prayer daily. I want to attend amals after Isha prayer only 3 days a week. So if I don?t sit in taleem of Fazaail-e-Amal and Mashwara without the permission of Ameer, will it be a sin.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not a sin to be absent from the Ta'leem. However, ensure that this is\nnot a means of one totally abandoning the virtuous collective efforts being\nmade.\n\nIt is etiquette to take permission of the Ameer. It cannot be technically\nsaid to be Fardh, Waajib or Mustahabb.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
