  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Mufti Sahib, Assalam-o-alykum! I have come accross a hadith stating \"The most blessed nikah is the one with the least expenses.\" In modern days, many coustoms have been introduced among muslim community, like preparing the bride with special wedding dress, lightening the home, inviting the guests from outside the city, joining the ceromony in some hall, etc etc. What if a person can easily spend so much money to celebrate his wedding? Does spending more money make the nikah unblessed? please guide us with details.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Hadith is clear. It includes the person who can even afford spending the money.\n\nIslam emphasises on simplicity. Furthermore, the money used on special\ndresses, lightening, etc. can be used for a more beneficial course, for\nexample, giving it to the boy and girl to set up their home and life, etc.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
