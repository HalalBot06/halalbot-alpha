  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI was interested in finding out the following concerns: \nWhat does it mean when they say that your namaaz won't be accepted if you have any haram on your body during namaz?  I ask because recently we had a loss in our home and claimed from insurance.  We had money left over, so we purchased new carpeting for bedrooms using that money.  Since the money was from insurance claim, can we still stand on janimaz that is on top on this new carpet and pray?  What if our feet or hands touch carpet during namaz?  Is this considered haram?  Family says that whole house is under mortgage, so that could mean every inch of house was bought with haram money...please guide in light of Quran and hadith.  Wa Salaam\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\n1) A person who is nourished with Haraam or he is wearing clothes that were purchased using Haraam funds etc, if he performs Salaah in that condition, his Salaah will be valid and he will be relieved of his obligation, but he will not receive the full reward for his Salaah.\n\n2) In principle, it is not permissible for a person to insure his house, car, business etc. However, if a person has already insured his house (as in this case) or he is compelled to do so, it will be permissible for him to receive from that company the amount which he has already paid. Any amount received more and above what he has paid to that company will be regarded as interest and should be disposed of by giving it to the poor without any intention of reward.\n\n(Fatawa Mahmoodiyyah, vol.16, pg.387, Faruqiyyah)\n(Aap ke Masāil, vol.6, pg.255,Maktaba bayyinaat)\n\nYou should determine whether the amount you have received was more than what you have paid to that company or less. If it was more, then the surplus amount should be given out in charity.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftāa"
