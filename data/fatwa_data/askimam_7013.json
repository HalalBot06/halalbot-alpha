  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. In our country Government going to supply recycled water (source is from waster water and suspect it includes Najees aswell) to the public. The test result said that the water is pure to consume. My question is, is it permissible to consume this water (drink, wudhu, bath and everything)? 2. I plan to visit my mother country (India) to celeberate 'Eidul Fitr' with my paraents & wife Insha-Allah. For past 4 years I never celeberate it with my parants. If it is a case for me to go India, I need to fly on a fasting day. Is it Mustahab to keep fast on that day or skip fast on that day? or Better aviod this type of visiting as it cause skipping fast? I feel I can fast on that day while I'm in travelling. Please advice me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In principle, if the original qualities of the recycled water is retained and the taste, smell and colour has become as normal water. It is permissible to use recycled water for drinking, Wudhu, bathing, etc. (Fataawa Hindiyyah vol.1 pg.10)\n\n2. Shari?ah has shown ease with regards to the laws of a Musaafir. If a Musaafir (traveler) feels that it shall be difficult to fast while traveling, then he may not fast during Ramadhaan and keep the Qadhaa after Ramadhaan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
