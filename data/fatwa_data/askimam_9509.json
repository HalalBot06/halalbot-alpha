  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)My friend was asking if it is permissible to let his wife dominate him.also,is use of sex toys like dildo on private parts of wife and husband permissible in islam?2)I need to know what is number of daily salaats one has to offer in case of qadha salaat for 1 full day.the answer should be for a shafi.3)the answers which u give r all fatwas which need to be acted upon?.jazakallahukhair..\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has mentioned, 'Modesty is part of%0D%0AImaan (faith).' It is, thus, necessary to behave in a modest manner and not%0D%0Aadopt the immoral traits and habits of the Kuffaar. Domination is a practice%0D%0Aof the shameless Kuffaar and it denobles man when Allah has honoured him.%0D%0AThe use of sexual toys to enhance foreplay is permissible on condition that%0D%0Athese toys do not cause any harm or contain any forbidden ingredients.%0D%0ASimilarly, these toys should not be inserted into the female private part,%0D%0Aexcept in the case of dire necessity. One should also ensure that he does%0D%0Anot commit any Haraam act when acquiring these toys nor should he go to any%0D%0Aplaces of Haraam, such as adult gift shops. Even though one will be going%0D%0Afor a valid reason, he is sure to look at Haraam pictures and others who see%0D%0Ahim enter will probably entertain evil thoughts about him.%0D%0A2. A Shaafi'ee should make Qadhaa of all the Fardh Salaats, viz. 2 Rakaats%0D%0Aof Fajr, 4 of Dhuhr, 4 of Asr, 3 of Maghrib and 4 of Esha. If he wishes he%0D%0Acan also make Qadhaa of the Sunnats and Witr Salaays. However, this is not%0D%0Anecessary.%0D%0A3. All our answers are given so that they are acted upon. However, the ideal%0D%0Asituation would be that one consults a Mufti from his area whom he relies on%0D%0Aand should act on whatever he directs you to do.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
