  "question": "According to the Shariâ€™ah, what now is the method to re-establish the Khilafah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)If a person keeps continually breaks wudu, due to minimal urine drops after urinating, can a person pray while this happens? This may last for 30 minutes. 2)According to the Shari?ah, what now is the method to re-establish the Khilafah? The reason why I ask this is, a brother has told me that, to live under the Islamic state is Fard. Then the brother tells me that there is a Shari?ah principle which states ?whatever leads to a fard becomes a fard?. So therefore we as a ummah must work towards this fard (Khilafah). So now the brother tells me that, I must join the ?hizbu-tahrir?, this is a jammat that will re-establish the Khilafah, because the brother tells me that a shaykh called Taqi uddin nabhani, has done ijtihad on the issue at hand. The brother has me almost convinced, I do not know what to do! He is quoting Qu?ranic verses like ? let there rise amoung you, a group, which will enjoy the good and forbid the evil? he claims that, this is the jamaat Allah has metioned in the Qur?an. The brother tells me that the Prophet Salalahi wasalam had a group. Please help, as I have no answers. 3)Acording to the Hanafi Madhab, which animals are Halal to eat? 4) Can you list all the shaykhs that gave Imam Abu Hanifah Ijaza? 5)What can I do physically for my brother and sisters in the middle east, who are being attacked by the jews? 6)What is the solution, for the war which is going on in the middle east, according to the Qur'an and Sunnah? .\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. No, he has to wait until he feels at ease and there is no chance of any\nmore drops. Then only may he make Wudhu and perform Salaat.\n2. Before thinking about re-establishing the Khilaafah, we need to\nre-establish our lives according to the Sunnah.\n3. Cattle - like cows, sheep, goats, buffaloes, camels, etc. Certain\nwild-animals, like springbok, deer, etc. are also Halaal. The list is quite\nlong. What exactly is the point of your question.\n4. There are literally hundred of Shaykhs. Check Jamiul Masaaneed of Imaam\nAbu Hanifa (RA)\n5. Make Du'aa for them.\n6. The solution lies in adhering to the Qur'aan and Sunnah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
