  "question": "1)What is the precise difference between Waajid and farz? 2)If pardha is reported to be FARDH so clearly in the Quran then why are there so many different opinions on it.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n2)If pardha is reported to be FARDH so clearly in the Quran then why are there so many different opinions on it. You seem to show it being so clearly said in the Quran. Well them why is it that even some Alims say that showing of the face is ok? If its said so clear then why doesnt everyone have the same opinion about it being FARZ and not just recommended? 3) What does the word 'kaafir' really mean. I know it means a disbeliever but is it someone who is not a 'muslim' or someone who doesnt believe in god? Because if its someone who just isnt a 'Muslim' then even christians and jew are kaafir right?4)can you say a dua to get married to the person you want to easily with the person liking you too?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Fardh and Waajib are academic terms having specific definitions. In principle, any ruling that is deduced from a text that is Qatiyyus-Thuboot (expressly proven) and Qatiyyud-Dalaalah (expressly indicative) is Fardh. If a ruling is deduced from a text that is Qatiyyus-Thuboot but Dhaniyyut-Dalaalah (not expressly proven but through conjecture), it will be Waajib. %0D%0A%0D%0A2. There are two aspects of Purdah. One is covering the body and the hair, that is Fardh. The second is covering the face which is Waajib. Both Fardh and Waajib are common in the ruling of being compulsory. The difference is in the degree of compulsion which will manifest itself in the degree of sin for not adhering to the compulsion.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. The word Kaafir means a disbelievers and is general which includes all disbelievers including Christians and Jews as they do not believe in Allah as is Allah?s Right. Allah Ta?ala states, ?Those who say that Allah is a third of three (trinity) have committed Kufr.?%0D%0A%0D%0A4. It is permissible to make Du?aa to get married to the person of your choice. The Du?aa should not be to maintain any un-Islamic intentions or thoughts.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
