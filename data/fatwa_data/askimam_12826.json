  "question": "How to know Which Islamic site to visit",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected brother, I always wait for your updates and visit your site regularly. I also like to visit other Islamic sites to add more to my limited knowledge about Islam. My question is how can I know that which site is free from the wrong concepts and evil propaganda. For example, I found a site somebody mentioned in asking you a question. I went there and read some of the material and found that instead of teaching Islam in the light of the holy Qura?n and Ahadees-e-Mubarika, the author was more interested in blaming other sects like Tableeghi Jamaat and Deobandees etc. and using words that were definitely not appropriate for an Aalim or Mufti to publish. Please advise how can I make sure that the site I?m going to visit is free from these type of Fitnaas. There are chances that some sites are created by non-Muslims to spread wrong concepts about Islam. It could be from Ismaelees or Kadianees or Boraas etc. This is really important for us and our kids abroad in non-Muslim countries whom we always encourage to learn more about Islam through books and Internet.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is fiddicult to determine the authenticity of Islamic sites.\n\nOur advice is not to follow a site until one is certain of its authenticity. Muhammad ibn Sireen [ra] advises, ?Verily, this knowledge is Deen. So see from you you take your Deen.?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
