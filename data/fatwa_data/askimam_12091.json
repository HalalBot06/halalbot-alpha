  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it haraam for women to wear a brassiere? An older lady told me it is not advisable as it highlights the shape of the body. Is there any ruling on it, or is it a personal choice. Also, i wear a niquab with full covering except for my feet. Living in hot country, i often wear sandals, or open shoes. Is it allowed to bear the feet, or should i have to wear some socks etc to cover it?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWomen may were a brassiere. It is not Haraam. However, when is the presence of any male besides the husband they should ensure that the shape of their bodies is not exposed.\n\nThe feet below the ankles may be exposed. It is not essential to wear socks.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
