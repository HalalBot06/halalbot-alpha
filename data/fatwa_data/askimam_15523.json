  "question": "Do you see any contradictions in our Aqeedah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nBrothers, do you see any contradictions to our -sunni- Aqida in the following passage.\n\nAttributes of God: so exalted, peerless and hidden a beauty, just as it desires to view its own fairness in a mirror and to behold the degrees and measures of its beauty in an animate reflection, desires also to become manifest, in order to look on its own beauty through the eyes of others. That is, it wishes to look at its own beauty in two ways; firstly, by beholding itself in mirrors of variegated colour; secondly, through the gaze of yearning witnesses to itself, of bewildered admirers of its beauty.?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe statement creates an impression that Allah is in need of other means to see His own beauty. Allah is As-Samad. He is independent in every way. He is not in need of anything to see or understand His beauty.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
