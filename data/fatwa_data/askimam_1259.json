Kindly%0D%0Aref our reply to similar question below.%0D%0A%0D%0ASalaams%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is not permissible for a Muslim female to marry a non-Muslim male.%0D%0AHowever, a Muslim male may marry only Christian or Jewish female. It is not%0D%0Apermissible for a Muslim male to marry any other non-Muslim female.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe reason it is permissible for the Muslim male to marry a non-Muslim%0D%0Afemale is that he would be able to easily convince the Christian or Jewish%0D%0Awife into accepting Islam. There is a possibility of the non-Muslim male%0D%0Aconvincing his Muslim wife into abandoning Islam. Therefore, Islam has%0D%0Aconsidered her feminine nature and protected her correct beliefs from being%0D%0Aa victim of abuse from the male dominance.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Muslim husband is not obliged to pressurise his Christian%2FJewish wife to%0D%0Aaccept Islam. He may apply wisdom and diplomacy and only influence her to%0D%0AIslam. In Islam, a female is equally respected as a male, however, due to%0D%0Athe different masculine and feminine natures, Islam believes in separation%0D%0Aof roles.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is obvious that there are many things a male can do, which is not easily%0D%0Apossible for a female and vice versa.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above is a brief response.
