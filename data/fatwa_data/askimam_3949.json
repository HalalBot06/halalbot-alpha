  "question": "Dua after Prayer",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI heard that Imam Abu Hanifah rahmatullah 'alay used to recite congregational dua after fard salat, and the Prophet peace and blessings be upon him used to do it sometimes as well. If I understand that this is not a Sunnah act, is it still permissible to make congregational dua most of the time (when I'm imam)? I like to do it, and my intentions are for more blessings b/c more people say 'Amin'. Is it permissible to do congregational dua after salah on a continuous basis, knowing it's not Sunnah? I asked some people and they said it was okay b/c it was not contrary to the Sunnah. Is that a valid argument?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo make Du'a in any form (loudly, softly, collectively, etc.) and any time\n(before, after Fardh Salaat, etc.) is permissible. While there are\nsubstantiations for the different forms and times of making Du'a, Shari'ah\ndoes not restrict the making of Du'a in those forms or times not\nspecifically substantiated in Shari'ah. At most, making Du'a is permissible\nand an act of great virtue and merit.\n\nIt is not permissible to project a permissible act as compulsory as this is\nprojecting a wrong view of the Shari'ah, thus, causing distortion of Deen.\nTo regard the collective Du'a after Fardh Salaat or Sunnah Salaat as\ncompulsory will be Bid'ah as that projects the incorrect image of Shari'ah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
