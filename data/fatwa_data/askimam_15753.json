  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. Are the zaidi shias muslims?\n\n2. Is the usuli sect of the jafri muslims?\n\n3. Was hazrat Ali ra born inside the kaba shareef?\n\n4. Please explain the meaning of the first ayats of surah fath48. Some non muslims say that these verses mean that our beloved nabi salalhu alihi wasalam was a sinner nauzubilla.\n\n5. Are wahabis and barelwis considered to be sunni or non sunni and can we pray behind them?\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n2)      & 1)  Kindly inform us the Aqaid of the Zaidi Shias and the Usuli sect of Jafari muslims. Hereunder is the general difference between the Sunnis and Shias.\n\na)      [Unbridgeable Divide] - http://www.alinaam.org.za/library/udivide.html\n\n3)      No.\n\n4)      The word used in the verse is Dhanb . This refers to committing such acts that are permissible in Shariah but not preferred. Rasulullah :s: was sent as a Muallim (Teacher). He had to teach the Shariah to the Ummah.\n\nAt times this was practically carried out and in doing so he had to commit acts that are permissible but not preferred in Shariah. If a general person would commit such an act, that would be in order. The position of Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wassalam  was different\n\nHe held a very lofty position. His commission of such acts was not in keeping with his loft position. This can be understood through the following saying\n\nحسنات الابرار سيئات المقربين\n\nThe virtuous deeds of the Abraar(pious) are evils of the close ones\n\nAccordingly, such acts have been interpreted as Dhanb. The word should be understood within the context of the lofty personality of Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wassalam  and not in isolation.\n\n5)      If the Wahabies and Barelwies have the same Aqeeda as Sunnies then obviously they will be sunnies.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
