Brother, I will get straight to the point. It is haraam to marry a woman who is a non believer. Whether it is in a court or in a masjid, a marriage with an idol worshipper is not allowed for a Muslim man.\n\n \n\nIt does not matter how long you have known her or how much time you have spent with her. I understand that you have some feelings of regret that you have spent so much time with her and shared your secrets with her. It is also understandable that she feels that you have used her and that you are now letting her down. Ultimately you need to consider whether the pleasure and rewards of Allah Ta’ala mean more to you than those of a human being. You have to carefully think and ponder about your actions and at the same time also your future as a Muslim.\n\n \n\nSince this girl refuses to become a Muslim, you have no choice but to let her go. She is an adult and she has to take responsibility for her actions. This type of relationship is not cast in stone.\n\n \n\nDo not allow her to blackmail you emotionally. Her threats to commit suicide are childish and you should apply your mind towards giving her up. Each time the two of you have problems in the future, she will threaten you this way and thus control your life. Do you want to go on living a life of fear, instability and filled with threats?\n\n \n\nCrying like mad for her is pointless. Once again I say, think of your aagirah and you will realise that you cannot put your love for this woman before the love for Allah Ta’ala. You should shed tears of regret and fear for Allah Ta’ala, not for the loss of this woman. Shaitaan has you under his control.  You need to tear yourself away from shaitaan who has come to you in the form of this woman. Even if it means that you fear that your heart will be torn to shreds in the process, you have to let her go. It is better to suffer pain and loss in this world and to lose worldly desires and things rather than to lose your Jannah.\n\n \n\nYou have asked for help and these are our suggestions. Turn to your Creator who still loves you more than you love yourself. As long as you make sincere tawbah, shed tears of sorrow, regret and istigfar, you will be forgiven by Allah Ta’ala.\n\n \n\nSincerely promise Allah Ta’ala that you will not date or be alone with a non-mahram woman again. Become punctual with your 5 daily salaah. Read the Quran with understanding and make amal on it. Make abundant istigfar and zikr. Give charity daily, even if it is small amount and do go learn more about what your duties and responsibilities are as a Muslim man. Listening to bayaans is not going to help you unless you make a sincere effort to change and give up this woman completely. Don’t ever speak to her, see her, send text messages, email, write to her or contact her in any way (not even through another person). The choice is entirely yours as to what happens to you in the future.\n\n \n\nYou have to chose between success and failure, no one can do this for you. May Allah Ta’ala guide you to become an obedient servant and slave of His, ameen.\n\n \nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n \n\nSister Fadila,\nSocial Dept.\nDurban, South Africa\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
