  "answer": "QUESTION\ndid my ghusl break if i kissed a girl... not yet married\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is Haraam (strictly prohibited) to kiss a girl you are not married to. It is a very big and major sin.\n\nYou should make sincere Tawbah (repent) for that. If you did not ejaculate while kissing the girl, then your Ghusl will be intact. However, it is still advisable to make Ghusl as a form of Tawbah and repentance.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
