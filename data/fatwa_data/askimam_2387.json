  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Can one proceed with Azaan at the time of Zawaal? 2. What if Azaan is given a minute or so before the end of Zawaal? Please explain in the above two instances the correct method.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Adhaan should take place only after the time of Salaat has set in.\nAdhaan given before this has to be repeated even if only part of the Adhaan\ntook place before the time setting in. (Shaami vol.1 pg.385; HM Saeed)\n\nTherefore, one should wait until the time of Zawaal completely expires\nbefore proceeding with the Adhaan of Dhuhr.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
