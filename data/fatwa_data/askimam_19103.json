  "question": "We performed Tawaaf Ziyaarah after Isha on the 12th of Dhul Hijjah. Was our Hajj valid?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWe recently went for hajj with our 18 month old child. We could not perform Tawaf Al Ifada on 10th Dhul Hijjah and performed it on 12th Dhul Hijjah after Isha. We sacrificed an animal on behalf of me and my wife as a precaution.\n\nIs our Hajj valid or is there anything missing?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nTawaaf Al-Ifaadah (commonly referred to as Tawaaf Ziyaarah) is a rukn (a major element) of the Hajj.\n\nIt can be performed anytime from Fajr Sadiq (the beginning time of Fajr) of the 10th of Dhul Hijjah (the most preferred day) to sunset on the 12th of Dhul Hijjah.\n\nPerforming it anytime after sunset on the 12th of Dhul-Hijjah is Makruh-Tahrimi (close to being Haram) although it would suffice, and the Hajj would be valid. However a damm would become wajib due it being performed outside of its time.\n\n\n*Damm: Refers to the slaughtering of a goat, a sheep or a one-seventh part of a cow or a one-seventh part of a camel within the precincts of the Haram in lieu of certain violations made while performing the manaasik (rites) of Hajj.\n\nIf you made up for performing the Tawaaf Ziyaarah after its stipulated time with two damms (one damm for yourself and another separate damm for your wife) then the error has been recitifed, and the Hajj is valid and complete. If however, you only gave one damm then you should offer another damm.1\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMl.
