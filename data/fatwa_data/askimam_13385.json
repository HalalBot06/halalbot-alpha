  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nsome arabic brother dont start the salat till the feet are not touching each other and i follow hhanafi wht shuld i do?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nRasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] emphasized on straightening the Saffs. That is done by the shoulders being in line with one another. There is no need for the feet to touch one another.\n\nHowever, if the brother places his feet next to yours, you should tolerate that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
