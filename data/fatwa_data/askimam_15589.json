  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) Can the Person in Aitekaf (during Ramadan) can sleep in the multi purpose hall to keep the sanctitity of the mosque area?\n\n2) What is the ruling on sleeping in the Mosque designated area?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nSunnah itikaf is observed in the musjid proper. A person observing sunnah itikaf may leave the musjid proper only for natural reasons which cannot be fulfilled in the musjid property, for example relieving oneself. Sleep is a natural demand and can be fulfilled in the musjid proper. Sleeping during itikaf is not against the sanctity of the musjid. The very practice of itikaf is an expression of the sanctity of the musjid. If a person observing sunnah itikaaf leaves the musjid boundary and sleeps in the multi purpose hall, that will nullify his itikaf.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
