  "answer": "QUESTION\nas-salaam-ailikum According to my parents and other adults, one (Muslim) should try to recite Quran everyday because Quran in your house should not be kept without reading. Is it okay if I listen to the Quran in my radio instead of reading it myself. Does that count? Do I get same amount of sawab for either listening to it or reading it myself? Is there a limit of aleast how much you are suppose to recite everyday? Do you have to recite Quran Sharif everyday? Please reply back in detail. Thank you for the answerzz. May allah bless you and give you a place in jannah !!!!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe, as Insaan (man), are constantly searching for ways to bring Barakaat and%0D%0Ablessings in our homes. Which home can be more blessed than that home in%0D%0Awhich the most noble and honourable words of Allah Ta'ala are recited daily.%0D%0AIn one narrated Hadith, 'The best among you is he who reads the Qur'aan and%0D%0Ateaches it.' (Tabraani)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Qur'aan has been distributed into many portions so that its recitation%0D%0Acould be made easy:%0D%0A1. Manzil - the Qur'aan comprises of 7 Manzils. This method was used by some%0D%0Aof the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) which made it easy for them to comple%0D%0Aone Qur'aan a week. First Manzil (Surah Baqara to Surah Nisaa pg.147),%0D%0ASecond Manzil (Surah Maaidah to Surah Tawbah pg.288), Third Manzil (Surah%0D%0AYunus to Surah Nahl pg.392), Fourth Manzil (Surah Israaeel to Furqaan%0D%0Apg.511), Fifth Manzil (Surah Shu'araa to Surah Yaaseen pg.618), Sixth Manzil%0D%0A(Surah Saaffaat to Surah Hujuraat pg.720), Seventh Manzil (Surah Qaaf to%0D%0ASurah Naas pg.848) (Qur'aan; Waterval print)%0D%0A2. Paras - the Qur'aan has 30 paras known as Juz.%0D%0A3. Quarters - each Juz has 4 quarters.%0D%0A4. Rukus - on the side of the Qur'aan, on almost every page, there is a sign%0D%0Awhich signifies a Ruku.%0D%0A%0D%0AAny of the distributions could be adopted depending on how much time one%0D%0Adedicates daily for the recitation of the Qur'aan.%0D%0A%0D%0AListening to the recitation of the Qur'aan from Radio will certainly earn a%0D%0Aperson reward. However, it is much more virtuous to recite the Qur'aan%0D%0Aitself.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AQari Ismail Abdul-Aziz%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALISATION IN QUR'AANIC SCIENCES%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
