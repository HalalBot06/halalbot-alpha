  "question": "Can you please explain this Hadith: Why was Rasool maqbool SAW angry? and why did he abandon the itikaaf that month?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nVolume 3, Book 33, Number 249: Narrated 'Amra: Aisha said, \"the Prophet used to practice Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan and I used to pitch a tent for him, and after offering the morning prayer, he used to enter the tent.\" Hafsa asked the permission of 'Aisha to pitch a tent for her and she allowed her and she pitched her tent. When Zainab bint Jahsh saw it, she pitched another tent. In the morning the Prophet noticed the tents. He said, 'What is this?\" He was told of the whole situation. Then the Prophet said, \"Do you think that they intended to do righteousness by doing this?\" He therefore abandoned the Itikaf in that month and practiced Itikaf for ten days in the month of Shawwal.\"\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFirstly, it should be borne in mind that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) never used to become angry for person reasons. Instead, he only used to get angry regarding matters of Deen. (Shamaail Tirmidhi)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe reason for which Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) did what he did in the aforementioned narration was to show his disapproval of what had happened, because it was possible that those blessed wives of his would have changed their intentions and reasons for I?tikaaf. Instead, of doing it for the pleasure of Allah Ta?ala, they would have ended up competing with one another. Or the reason could be that by so many of his wives coming into the Musjid, the purpose of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) performing I?tikaaf would be defeated (i.e. total seclusion from one?s family, friends and wealth for the sake of the Ibaadat of Allah).
