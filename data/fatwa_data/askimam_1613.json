  "question": "Is it obligatory for a \"convert\" or \"revert\" to change his name to a Muslim name?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNAMING THE CHILD%0D%0AIt is the infant's vested right to be honoured with a good name. When%0D%0Achoosing a name for the child, it should be done with the intention that the%0D%0Achild will be blessed with the barakah of that name. Here are some Ahadeeth%0D%0Ato show the importance of selecting a good and correct name:%0D%0A%0D%0AIbne Umar (RA) relates Rasoolullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) as saying:%0D%0A\"Truly, the most loved of your names by Allah are Abdullah and%0D%0AAbdur-Rahmaan.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is also reported in the Aboo Dawood that Rasoolullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam) said: \"Keep the names of prophets. And the most desirable names by%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala are Abdullah and Abdur-Rahmaan. And names that depict honesty%0D%0Aare Haarith (planter) and Hammaam (thoughtful). And the most disliked ones%0D%0Aare Harb (battle) and Murrah (bitter).%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE BARAKAH OF NAMING A CHILD AFTER THE BELOVED NAME OF RASOOLULLAN%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said: \"Whoever is named after me%0D%0Awith the hope of being blessed, he will be blessed and will be in peace till%0D%0Athe day of Qiyaamat.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AHe also said: \"To whomever is born a boy and he names him Muhammad solely%0D%0Afor the love of me and for the blessings of my name, then both he (the%0D%0Afather) and his son will enter Jannah.\"%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING GOOD NAMES%0D%0AHADITH: \"On the Day of Qiyaamah you will be called by your (own) names and%0D%0Athe names of your fathers. Therefore keep good names.\" Aboo Dawood.%0D%0AHADITH: \"To whoever is born a child, the child should be given a good name%0D%0Aand sound education. And when he becomes of age he should be married.\"%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AIt Was Rasoolullah's (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) practice to enquire the%0D%0Anames of persons and villages. If they were pleasant, it became apparent on%0D%0Ahis face. If not, his displeasure could be seen.%0D%0A%0D%0AOnce Rasoolullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) called for a volunteer to%0D%0Amilk a camel. Four persons volunteered: he refused to accept the services of%0D%0Athe first three because their names did not imply pleasantness. The names of%0D%0Athe first two were Murrah (bitter) while Jamrah (burning coal) was the name%0D%0Aof the third person. When the fourth said his name is Yaeesh (long live)%0D%0ARasoolullah sallallaahu-alayhi-wasallam said to him: \"Milk her.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AUNDESIRABLE NAMES SHOULD BE CHANGED%0D%0AAa'ishah (RA) reports that Rasool sallallaahu-alayhi-wasallam used to change%0D%0Adispleasing names replacing them with good names. Abdullah bin Umar (RA)%0D%0Arelates that one of his sisters was named Aasiyah (disobedient).%0D%0ARasoolullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) changed it to Jameelah%0D%0A(beautiful). Zainab (RA) says that I had been named Birrah (pious).%0D%0ARasoolullah sallallaahu-alayhi-wasallam said: \"Do not claim piety for Allah%0D%0Aknows best who amongst you are pious. Name her Zainab!\"%0D%0A%0D%0ANAMES MAY INFLUENCE THE LIVES OF PEOPLE%0D%0ASa'eed ibne Musayib (RA) relates from his father that his grandfather went%0D%0Ato Rasoolullah sallallaahu-alayhi-wasallam and was asked: \"What is your%0D%0Aname?\" He replied: \"Hazn\" (sorrow). Rasoolullah sallallaahu-alayhi-wasallam%0D%0Asaid: \"You are Sahl.\" (contended). He replied: \"I will not change the name%0D%0Amy father had given me.\" The narrator says that thereafter sorrow%0D%0Acontinually remained with them.%0D%0A%0D%0AKEEP AWAY FROM NAMES IMPLYING SHIRK%0D%0AAs Muslims, we should always abstain from keeping names implying any%0D%0Aelements of Shirk, like adjoining the word 'Abd'(servant) to names or%0D%0Aepithets other that those of Allah Ta'ala. Rasoolullah%0D%0Asallallaahu-alayhi-wasallam also forbade keeping pompous and selfglorifying%0D%0Anames, for this reveals arrogance and haughtiness - human elements most%0D%0Aabhorred by Allah Ta'ala.%0D%0A%0D%0ABE PROUD OF YOUR IDENTITY AND FAITH%0D%0AMuslims should always be proud of their identity and faith. Nowadays, to%0D%0Aconceal his identity, it is common practice for a person to 'westernize' his%0D%0Aname, like substituting Yoosuf with Joe or Joseph, Sulaimaan with Solly or%0D%0ASully, Faatimah with Fatli, Sumay-yah with Summi, etc. Efforts to distort%0D%0Asuch beautiful names merely reveal an un-Islamic and sacreligious attitude.%0D%0ARemember, there exists behind each Islamic name an Islamic spirit and%0D%0Ameaning, which, when distorted, is ruined. For example, there is intended%0D%0Alove for the Prophet of Islam, and barakah when naming a child Muhammad. But%0D%0Awhen Muhammad is called Mahmad or Gammat, this spirit of love for%0D%0ARasoolullah sallallaahu-alayhi-wasallam and the acquiring of barakah by such%0D%0Aa name is shattered. Should we not then refrain from such sacreligious%0D%0Apractices?%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala guide us so that we may realize the beauty and uniqueness%0D%0Aof the religion of Islam propounded by no other than the one who is the best%0D%0Aof Allah's creations-May Allah shower His choicest blessings upon him.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala guide us on the Right Path.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay He also grant this humble effort of mine to be a fulfilment of a%0D%0Along-felt need amongst the Muslims-especially the English-speaking Muslims.%0D%0AAmeen.%0D%0A%0D%0ANames for Muslim Children%0D%0ABy M Rafeeq Hathurani%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0ANAMES FOR MUSLIM CHILDREN%0D%0APsychologists now apprehend the wisdom of the effect a person's name has on%0D%0Ahis life. But Muhammad (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) had revealed this fact%0D%0Ato his followers already 1400 years ago. His teaching to his followers was%0D%0Athat children should be given good names, and that meaningless names and%0D%0Athose having unsavoury connotations should be avoided. Subsequently, we find%0D%0Amany incidents mentioned in the Hadith where Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam) changed the names of people with this object.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnother aspect of a person's name is that it bespeaks a person's religion.%0D%0AHence, the name of a Muslim is usually of such a nature that by the mere%0D%0Amention of it, the listener understands that the person so addressed, is a%0D%0AMuslim. It is for this reason that our elders laid great emphasis on keeping%0D%0Agood and pleasant names.%0D%0A%0D%0ABut since the widespread of Western culture throughout the world, it has%0D%0Abecome customary amongst Muslims not to take into cognisance the meaning of%0D%0Athe name when naming a child. Many do not even bother to ascertain whether%0D%0Ait is permissible for one to keep such a name or not. Often, even if the%0D%0Aname is correct and suitable, then by way of abbreviating it, its Islamic%0D%0Aconnotation is distorted. In fact, at times it even become unlawful to%0D%0Aaddress one by such a name. For example, Abdur-Rahmaan is called Rahmaan;%0D%0AAbdur-Razzaaq, Razaaq; Abdul-Wahhaab, Wahhaab - whereas Rahmaan, Razzaaq and%0D%0AWahhaab are the exclusive epithets of Allah Ta'ala. To address any creation%0D%0Aby such a name, is therefore unlawful.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhile this disease is rampant in the entire Muslims World, it is more in%0D%0Avogue in South Africa: Sulaymaan is called Solly; Yoosuf is called Joosub,%0D%0AEssop or Joe; Uthman is called Ossy, etc. In this way the blessed names of%0D%0Athe Anbiyaa (alayhimus-salaam) and Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) are%0D%0Adistorted and needlessly rendered meaningless. Moreover, one may never know%0D%0Awhether the one so addressed is a Muslim or not.%0D%0A%0D%0AHence, with regards naming children, there was a need for compiling a book%0D%0Awherein all misconceptions could be eradicated and guidance could be given%0D%0Aas to the importance of giving correct and meaningful names. Alhamdulillah,%0D%0Arespect Brother, Moulana Qaree Muhammad Rafeeq, teacher at Madrasah Islamia,%0D%0ALenasia has fulfilled this need proficiently in the pages to follow. The%0D%0Arespected compiler has in his introduction explained most ably the Islamic%0D%0Ateachings regarding a new-born child. The Masaail pertaining to Tahneek,%0D%0AAdhaan, Du'aas, circumcision, naming a child - and many more - have been%0D%0Aexplained in detail. Apart from having compiled a book on Muslim names in an%0D%0Aalphabetic order, he has also rendered their meanings and their literal and%0D%0Ahistorical aspects as well. During my tour of South Africa, I have had a%0D%0Acursory perusal of the book from various portions and found it to be most%0D%0Ainvaluable. In my opinion it should find its place into the home of every%0D%0AMuslim - that no family should remain without it.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala grant the compiler the best of rewards in both the worlds%0D%0Afor the services rendered by him, and may He also grant this book acceptance%0D%0Aand grant him the guidance to render more and greater service of this%0D%0Anature, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0AMuhammad Taqee Uthmaani%0D%0AServant of the Students%0D%0ADarul-Uloom, Karachi%0D%0A"
