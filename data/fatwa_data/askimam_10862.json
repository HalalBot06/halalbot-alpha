  "question": "Why is it to face the feet towards the Qibla people say it is ghunnah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhy is it to face the feet towards the Qibla people say it is ghunnah? Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Qibla is from amongst the salient features of Islam, which a person should show respect to. Facing one's feet towards Qibla intentionally should be avoided. Spitting in the direction of the Qibla has been prohibited in the Ahadith. Allah Taala says and whosoever respects the salient features of Allah, that is from the piety of the heart. (S 22\nV.32)\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
