  "answer": "QUESTION\nMay I ask you under which conditions, according to shariya can a muslim marry A women from the people of the book I read in glorious Quran that it is allowed To marry from ahle al-kitab. In our time and particularly these days which criteria and Conditions should be take in to consideration before making a decision regarding The marriage. Please explain from all possible perspective. Jazakallahukhairan. Abdullah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n'And We have made permissible the pure women from the believers and the pure%0D%0Awomen from the people of the Book.' (Maaidah)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above verse is clear that it is permissible for a Muslim male to marry a%0D%0Afemale from the Ahl-ul-Kitaab (Jews%2FChristians).%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Christians during the time of the revelation had the distorted beliefs%0D%0Aof trinity, crucifixion, etc. Despite that, Allah Ta'ala permits marrying a%0D%0AChristian or Jewish female. However, the purpose of marrying such females is%0D%0Atheir apparent adherence to a heavenly revealed book which could be a%0D%0Astepping stone into understanding the true religion (Islam). Understandably%0D%0Aa marriage has influence on a person's thinking and ideology. Since the male%0D%0Ais stronger generally, he would be able to influence his wife into Islam.%0D%0ATherefore, it is not permissible for a Muslim female to marry a Christian or%0D%0AJewish male purchance she will be influenced to leave Islam.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt must be noted that if the Muslim male is weak in his Islam, and there is%0D%0Afear of him being influenced by the Christian%2FJewish wife, it is not%0D%0Apermissible for him to marry her. A Christian%2FJewish woman should not be%0D%0Ajust by registration while not really being a Christian%2FJew.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
