  "question": "Homosexuality? How do we prove that homosexuality is unnatural and why it is haram?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow do we prove that homosexuality is unnatural and why it is haram? A muslim friend of mine believes that people don?t have a choice to be gay or not because of a lot of research that proves that homosexuality may be biological. Some of this research includes studies done on twins or family members that have been separated and therefore raised in different environments ? but they both still end up gay. How do we refute this type of evidence?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHomosexuality is Haraam simply because Allah declares it to be Haraam. An innate inclination towards homosexuality does not render it natural and ultimately acceptable. Their research is purely research and theory.\n\nEven if a person is inclined to the same sex, he is required to curb his desires just as in the case where a person is inclined to a woman who is Haraam for him. He is required to control his desires and abstain.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
