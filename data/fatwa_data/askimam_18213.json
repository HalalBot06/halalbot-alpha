  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nis there a story that imam abu hanifa saw allah in his dream 100 times and on the 100 time allah swt  gave him a dua if this is true could you please give me the dua in arabic in a bigger format\n\nalso     i know that it is haraam to eat chicken and meat from outside like mcdonalds and such in america but my friend doesnt believe me, could you please give me a sound hadith or ayah from the quran?\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1) Hammad (Rahimahullah), who is the son of Imam Abu Hanifa (Rahimahullah), narrates that when his father saw Allah Ta’ala for the one hundredth time in his dream, he asked Allah Ta’ala what can save creation from His punishment on the Day of Qiyamah. Allah Ta’ala instructed to recite the following every morning and evening:\n\nسبحان الابدي الابد . سبحان الواحد الاحد . سبحان الفرد الصمد . سبحان رافع السماء بغير عمد . سبحان من بسط الارض على ماء جمد . سبحان من خلق الخلق فا حصاهم عدد . سبحان من قسم الرزق و لم ينس احد . سبحان الذي لم يتخذ صاحبة و لا ولد . سبحان الذي لم يلد و لم يولد و لم يكن له كفوا احد\n\n(Muqaddamah Nurul-Idaah, P. 4, Qadeemi Kutub Khana)\n\n2) It is impermissible to eat meat in such restaurants in the U.S. since the meat is not slaughtered in the name of Allah. Many times, people get confused over the verse of the Quran in Surah al-Maaidah which states:\n\n“The food of the People of the Book is lawful for you” (5:4)\n\nFrom this verse, they conclude that all meat in such restaurants (of animals which are permissible to consume) is permissible. This is wrong for several reasons.\n\nAllah Ta’ala clearly follows up the abovenetioned verse in Surah al-An’aam, where He states:\n\nفكلوا مما ذكر اسم الله عليه إن كنتم بآياته مؤمنين (118) وما لكم ألا تأكلوا مما ذكر اسم الله عليه وقد فصل لكم ما حرم عليكم إلا ما اضطررتم إليه وإن كثيرا ليضلون بأهوائهم بغير علم إن ربك هو أعلم بالمعتدين (119) ...... ولا تأكلوا مما لم يذكر اسم الله عليه وإنه لفسق وإن الشياطين ليوحون إلى أوليائهم ليجادلوكم وإن أطعتموهم إنكم لمشركون (121)\n\n“So, eat (the flesh) of that (animal) upon which the name of Allah has been invoked (when slaughtering), if you do believe in His verses. What should cause you to avoid eating of that upon which the name of Allah has been invoked, while He has spelled out to you all that He has made unlawful for you, except that to which you are compelled by extreme necessity? Surely, there are many who misguide people on the basis of their desires without having knowledge. Surely, your Lord is the best Knower of those who cross the limits………Do not eat that (meat) over which the name of Allah has not been pronounced. This is surely a sin. The satans inspire their friends to dispute with you. If you were to obey them, you would be Mushriks. (6:118-119, 121)\n\nThese verses clearly mention that it is only permitted to eat that meat upon which the name of Allah is invoked at the time of slaughtering, and that eating meat in which the name of Allah has not been pronounced at the time of slaughter is a sin. According to the Hanafi Madhab, if a Christian or Jew were to slaughter meat, they must take the name of Allah in order for it to be Halaal. Furthermore, many people in Western countries claim to be or are labeled as Christians, but they do not have firm beliefs in God, a revealed book, etc. Therefore, they are only Christians by name but have similar beliefs to Atheists. These people cannot be considered the people of the book and their meat will be Haraam. Finally, most of these large restaurant corporations receive meat in large quantities. It is likely that their meat is machine slaughtered, as is a popular method nowadays. It is highly unlikely during machine slaughtering (in which a maximum number of animals are slaughtered in the shortest amount of time) that the conditions for validity of the slaughter are fulfilled.\n\nConcluding, the meat served in those restaurants will be impermissible as the conditions of a valid slaughter are likely not fulfilled. It is ever so important for us as believers to be extremely cautious with regards to what we eat. Not only is it stated that if a morsel of Haraam food is in one’s body, then forty days of worship will not be accepted, but it is also stated in a Hadith that a body which is nourished with Haraam will not enter paradise. These are severe consequences indeed for those who are not careful in this regard. May Allah Ta’ala protect us all.\n\nحدثنا محمد بن محمد التمار قال : نا قرة بن حبيب قال : ثنا عبد الواحد بن زيد قال : ثنا أسلم الكوفي ، عن مرة الطيب ، عن زيد بن أرقم ، عن أبي بكر الصديق قال : قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : « لا يدخل الجنة جسد غذي من الحرام »\n\n(Al-Mu’jam al-Awsat-Tabraani)\n\nيا سعد أطب مطعمك تكن مستجاب الدعوة ، والذي نفس محمد بيده ، إن العبد ليقذف اللقمة الحرام في جوفه ما يتقبل منه عمل أربعين يوما\n\n(Al-Mu’jam al-Awsat-Tabraani)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
