  "question": "Following an Imam doing masah over socks. If I am offering prayer behind an Imam who I knowhas done masah over regaular socks what should I do.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn the masjid I go to sometimes the brother leading the salat is someone who does masah over regualar cotton socks. If I am offering prayer behind an Imam who I know has done masah over regaular socks what should I do. Talking to them is not possible.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMaking Masah over regular socks is not permissible according to all four schools of Fiqh.\n\nIt is not permissible to offer Fardh Salaat behind a person who makes Masah over regular socks. It is the responsibility of the trustees of the Musjid to employ wisdom and insight in stopping him from making Masah over normal cotton socks. However, we suggest you hand over the matter to the committee and let them handle the situation. If there are other Masaajid nearby we suggest you go to another Musjid.\n\nIf you are sure that the Imaam made Masah on regular socks, then any Salaat performed behind him will have to be repeated.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
