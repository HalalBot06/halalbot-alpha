  "question": "What does the Islam say regarding intercourse with slave girls? In my opinion Zina or sex with any women is forbidden in Islam",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA man may have intimate relations with his wife or slave girl. This applies\nno matter how many slave girls one may possess. He may not have intimate\nrelations with his servant. A slave is one whom one physically owns. Since\nslavery is not in vogue nowadays, this does not apply today.\n\nRefer attached, 'Slavery'\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
