  "question": "I reverted to Islam, does this now mean I have to divorce my christan husband of over 16 years?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe have been happily married, and now are no longer to have children. He does not mind my being muslim and respects my beleifs. We love each over very much and do not want to part. And he is not willing to revert to Islam just to say married, only if it came from his heart then he would revert. But Its not likely to happen anytime soon.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the non-Muslim woman reverts to Islam but her non-Muslim husband does not\ndo so, then after the passing of 3 menstrual cycles, the marriage will\nterminate.\n\nWe understand your predicament and sympathise with you. If you are able to\nseparate from your husband if he does not revert to Islam, then in the eyes\nof Allah, this would be highly loved and appreciated. If you cannot part\nfrom him, then you should not turn away from Islam. Therefore, if you have\nto remain with him, then daily make Istighfaar (seek Allah's forgiveness)\nand constantly invite your husband towards Islam with Hikmat (wisdom) and\npatience. Do not be overbearing as this might turn him away from Islam.\n\nMay Allah Ta'ala bless your husband with Islam, make your life easy for you\nand may He grant you the strength and ability to obey his commands, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
