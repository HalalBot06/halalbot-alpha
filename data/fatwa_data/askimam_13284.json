  "question": "Should one read the dua that is read after wudu First or should one read the dua which is recited after hearing of the adhaan",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to clarify what should be done first in the case where when one enters the mosque for any particular prayer and he does not have wudu. But as he is performing his Wudu the Adhaan is being performed in the background. There have been many a times where my wudu has been complete at the same time the adhaan has been completed by the mu'azzin. Should one read the dua that is read after wudu First or should one read the dua which is recited after hearing of the adhaan.\n\nYour assistance is humbly appreciated.\n\nJazakallah khair\n\nWa alaikum salam.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nOne may recite any du’aa first. However, if the Wudhu was completed before the Adhaan, then it is advisable that the du’aa of wudhu be recited first. If the Adhaan was completed before the Wudhu, then the du’aa of Adhaan be recite first.\n\nIf both, the Wudhu and Adhaan, finished at the same time, then the du’aa of whatever commenced first between Wudhu and Adhaan be recited first. The above is based on the principle of the first being preferred.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
