  "question": "Is a silver ring allowed for men to wear?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRecently some people told me that a silver ring is allowed for muslim men. However I remembered reading somewhere that gold, silk and silver are prohibited for men. I therefore went through Sahih Muslim and BUkhari. I found that our Prophet(pbuh) had a silver ring which he used only for the purpose of putting seals on letters which He used to send to emporers who would otherwise not accept the letter. However, when the people started putting silver rings as a practice or luxury sign and our prophet(pbuh) then threw away his silver ring. So, from the above summary of few hadiths would it be correct to infer that silver rings are prohibited. I saw the same narrations for gold rings which the prophet threw and thereafter nobody used gold rings. Only the same silver ring with rasoolullah written on it was used by the first three caliphs. Please explain.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe ring which was thrown away by Nabi (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) was of gold not of silver. The narrator of the hadith in both Bukhari and Muslim is said to have erred in saying that it was a silver ring. (See Fathul Bari and Sharhun Nawawi)\n\nThus Nabi (sallalahu alaihi wasallam) used a silver ring throughout his life, so did his sahabah, in fact Nabi (sallalahu Alaihi wasallam) informed those sahabah who wanted to wear a ring, that could only wear one of silver.(Abu Dawud Vol.4 Pg.90, Tirmizi Vol.4 Pg.248, Ibn Hibbaan Vol.12 Pg.299, Nasai Vol.8 Pg.172)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
