Yes, your marriage is valid in terms of the Shari?ah.\n\n2. Since you failed to get your parents blessings, you should now make an all out effort to restore contact with them and try to maintain favourable ties with them. Even if they wish to sever all ties, you should do whatever you can to restore contact with them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
