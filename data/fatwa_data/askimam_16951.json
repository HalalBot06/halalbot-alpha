  "question": "Can a 15 year old propose to 21 year old girl?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nmy question is can a 15 year old boy propose a 21 year old girl....is there any age barrier in islam....but the marriage will not be held at present ....plz give the answer in detail . and in simple words ....jazakallah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is permissible for a 15 year old boy to propose to a 21 year old girl.\n\nHowever, it is important for both the young boy and the girl to consult with their seniors about marriage and seek their advice about choosing an appropriate marriage partner and the responsibilities that come along with marriage. Marriage is not only about permissibility and impermissibility. It is also about practicalities of life.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
