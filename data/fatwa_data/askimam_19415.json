Note that i love her.. but our parents dont know anything.. Neither me nd her never meet. We just talk on the phone..\n\nMufti Saab please tell me what i can do.. we've been talking for a year and some months.. is talking to her haraam? and would it break my fast?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\n1) It is absolutely forbidden (haram) for a person to unnecessarily interact with a non mahram (a non mahram is that woman with whom marriage is permissible).\n\nShariah has closed all the doors that may lead one to commit illicit sins.\n\nThis is why Allah the almighty states in the quran: \"And do not even come close to fornication!\" (Israa'/ verse: 32)\n\nWhy are you living in delusion? You are not sure whether the girl in question loves you or not! The best thing would be to inform your parents about the situation and to send a proposal for marriage. If the girl accepts, you will be happy and if she says no, then at least you know where you stand.\n\nYou should repent to Allah for all the times you have unlawfully spoken to the girl and make a firm intention to never commit this sin again.\n\n2) Indulging in haram whilst fasting deprives one from attaining maximum benefit from the month of Ramadhan and causes ones spirituality level to plummet. However, talking with a non mahram does not invalidate ones fast.\n\n\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Faraz Ibn Adam,\nUK\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
