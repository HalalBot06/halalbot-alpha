  "question": "Is it permissible to do plastic surgery on my face?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nq1.is it possible to do plastic surgery of face so as to have good look?\nq2. beer with 0% alcohol is permittedto drink?\nq3.is it possible to  read namaz in darkness?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1.      It is not permissible to undergo plastic surgery for the sake of beautifying one’s looks. (Jadid Fiqhi Masa’il, vol.1 pg. 327, Na’eemiyah)\n\n2.      It is not permissible to drink non-alcoholic beer. There is a small percentage of alcohol in the drink despite the fact that they claim it to be non-alcoholic; hence, it will not be permissible. Furthermore, even if such a beer or beverage is manufactured in the future with absolutely no alcohol in it whatsoever, it will not be becoming of a Muslim to partake of such beverages which will incite and encourage him to drink real beer. The Jurists mention that the means to Haram are also Haram. Therefore, despite such a drink not being Haram intrinsically, it will be Haram due to an external reason, namely, being a means of leading to Haram. Furthermore, a Muslim should have an inherent aversion and abhorrence for wine, alcohol and other Haram ingredients.\n\n3.      It is permissible to perform Salah in the dark.   \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Yusuf bin Yaqub,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
