  "question": "(aqheeda)Give some back ground of Asharees, Maturidis, Ibn Arabi, and Imam Gazali",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have great affection to Imam Gazali and I have seen our ulamas referring to Asharee, Maturidis, and Ibn Arabi. It saddens me to see that Imam Taimiyyah, Ibn Qayuum criticized Gazali and others. They criticize Sufi also where as there were many pious persons who were attributed to Sufism. I have great love to Ibn taimiyyah, Ibn qayum also. Can you discuss on this issue.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Imaam of the Ash'aris is Abul Hasan al-Ash'ari. The Imaam of the\nMaturidis is Abu Mansoor Maatrudi. Both Imaams were from the Ahlus sunnah\nWal Jamaa` and Imaams in Aqeedah.\n\nImam Ghazzaaly, Imaam ibn Araby, ibn Taymiyah and ibn Qayyim (RA) were great\nscholars. They had some independent views based on their vast knowledge and\nresearch. It is normal for academics in any field to differ with one\nanother. That is based on their scholarly approach. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu\nAlayhi Wasallam) said, 'The differences among my Ulama is Rahmat (mercy).'\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
