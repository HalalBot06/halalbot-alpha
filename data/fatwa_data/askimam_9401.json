  "question": "What does the Quran tell us about unmarried males being promiscuous without benefit of any form of marriage?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThere is confusion over this issue among young males. Some people say it is ok for males to behave in a promiscuous manner but not for females. Some people say one needs benefit of a marriage (mesyar or motaa or urfi). I am confused. many thanks.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is prohibited for any Muslim, male or female, to behave in a promiscuous manner. Shari?ah instructs us against immorality and shamelessness. Only a person who does not have shame and modesty will behave in a promiscuous manner.\n\nIf a person has attained physical maturity (buloogh) and have a desire to marry, he/she should do so. If that is not possible, then one must suppress his/her desires by fasting. This is the advice given to us by Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) himself. He did not suggest one release his base desires by being promiscuous. It is the evil of promiscuity that the world is suffering to cope up with. It leads to adultery, fornication, unwanted pregnancies, abortion, breaking up of marriages, extra marital affairs. The list goes on.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
