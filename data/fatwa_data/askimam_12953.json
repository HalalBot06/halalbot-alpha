  "question": "Music Is prohibited",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam U Aalaikum. I need guidance on the following (1) Firstly, I used to listen to music with a huge tape and cd collection of various musicals but it has been almost 8 months since I left all this and am trying to follow the Sunnah. I have packed and stacked these cassettes and cds in boxes but don?t know what to do with them. If I want I can sell them to others but that would mean that I am persuading others to commit a sin. What should I do with all this? (2) Moreover I have musical instrument with me which I want to dispose of, I have many offers for this. Can you tell me what to do with all these things? Can I sell them? (3) I feel like breaking them and dumping them in the sea. (4) I have also stopped watching tv but people say that if tv was wrong then no ulema would come on tv, they refer to zakir naik, ahmed deedat, dr. israr ahmed etc., I still don?t buy their reasoning and deem tv to be an impermissible act (5) What is the basis of wishing happy birthdays, as people get offended when I don?t wish them? (6) They say that there is no proof that this is wrong according to Shariah to wish and celebrate birthdays. Can you give me proof? Jazak Allah & Allah Hafiz!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMaashaa Allah, may Allah make it easy for you to live a life according to the Sunnah.\n\n1. Whatever unlawful things you have, it is better that you break it out or throw it away at such a place where no one can reuse them.\n\n2. Refer 1\n\n3. Refer 1\n\n4. Some Ulama doing impermissible things does not render them permissible.\n\n5. It is not permissible, since it resembles the non-Muslims. The Ulama have prohibited it. Furthermore, Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] has also prohibited us to inculcate the practice of non-Muslims. (Ahsanul Fataawa)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl.
