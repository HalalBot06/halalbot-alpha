  "question": "Can I treat my cousin sister as i treat my own sister?Can i kiss my cousin sister(she is a year and a half elder than me)as i kiss my own sister on forehead on the ocassions of EID and all.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn my family it is seen that all the brothers and sisters kiss each other on the occasion of EID or when they meet after a long time and even if they get emotional they hug too but i don't have any sister and once told to my cousin sister if would i had a sister then i would i have treated her like anything and would have fulfilled all her demands if ALLAH SWT had given me the capabilty to accomlish her all requirements at that time she told me can't you treat me as your own sister as you don't have one and this was about 6 or 7 years back and from that i kiss her and even hug her sometimes and she is elder than me and even married too.So i was thinking weather it is appropriate to treat a cousin sister like my own sister and to kiss her on her forehead.Jazakallahkhair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo maintain family ties is an express order of Allah Ta?ala in the Qur?aan. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has emphasised on maintaining family ties. You should maintain family ties with all your family. However, in doing so, you should not violate the orders of Allah Ta?ala and Shari?ah.\n\nYour cousin sister is a Ghayr Mahram to you. She is not prohibited in marriage to you. According to the Shari?ah, it is compulsory to maintain Hijaab from her. It is incorrect for you to kiss or hug her. Your love for her should be used to encourage her to obey the laws of Allah and get closer to Him.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
