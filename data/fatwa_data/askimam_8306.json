  "answer": "QUESTION\nIraq?s central region follows the hanafi madhab also saddam hussiens rebublican guard . When the scholars of Iraq issue fatwas for jihad is it fardz upon the ummah , because if the Iraqis follow the same madhab that means they follow the same rules of jihad applying to all hanafis. Also if someone was to miss fajr at its correct time and they made it a few hours after what is the punishment and the recommended repentance for such a thing, considering they missed fajr unintentionally but made it up as soon as possible. Is bin laden in the path of Allah considered that Allah ta allah has protected him for quite some time\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\ni1. Is it not appropriate for any one person to issue a ruling like Jihaad which affects the entire Ummah. For that, a Shura of responsible people should decide.\n\n2. If a person missed Fajr Salaat due to reasons beyond one?s control, for example, sleep, then he will be excused.\n\n3. Allah Ta?ala grants protection to whosoever He wishes. Many people who were who were in the path of Allah also lost their lives.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
