  "answer": "QUESTION\nmuhtaram mufti sahib, assalaamu alaikum 1) is the well known nasheed tala'al badru 'alayna (sung by the girls of medina when the holy prophet (saw) arrived in medina) found in imam bayhaqi's Dalaail un Nubuwwa and is it also in any other books of hadith and is it authentic? 2) in the quran we read about the duas of the various prophets eg. hazrat zakariyya (a.s) in ale imran , hazrat adam (a.s) in surah a'raaf , but obviously the duas in the quran are in arabic , so does this mean that each of the various prophets duas which are found in the quran were made in arabic or did they make the duas in their own languages and the quranic duas are a translation of that in arabic? 3) what will be the fate of hazrat jibra'eel , mika'eel, israfeel, and izra'eel in the hereafter and also the fate of haroot and maroot if known? 4) what was the name of the sahabi who could never visit rasulullah due to caring for his mother and is he technically therefore a sahabi? , do you also think that this shows how much we should honour our mothers? 5) what is known about the illness of hazrat ayoob (a.s)? , was the severity of the disease only meant to test the prophet ayoob or was it a common illness that just happened to last a long time, and how long did it actually last?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Yes, it is found in Dalaailun Nubuwwah (v.2, p.g 506). Hafiz Ibnul Hajr\nR.A has briefly discussed this incident. (See - Fathul-Bari vol.7 p.g 333)\n2. The duas were made in the Arabic language.\n3. It is mentioned in the hadith that they too will perish. (see\nTafseer -Mazhari p.g 151 vol 10).\n4. Hazrat Uwais AL-Qarni (R.A). Since he did not see (Rasulullah\nSallaahu-alaihi-wasallam ), he is not a Sahabi. His incident most certainly\nillustrates to us the importance of serving one's parents.\n5. It was an illness to test him. There are differences amongst the\nMufassireen as regard to the duration of his illness. Some say that he\nremained ill for 3 years, while others say that he remained ill for atleast\n7 years. (see Tafseer -ibn Katheer vol.3 p.g 251 -Surah Al-Ambiya)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
