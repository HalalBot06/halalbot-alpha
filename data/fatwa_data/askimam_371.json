  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it permissible to follow a Mathab and then take a religious rulingfrom another mathab regarding a single issue. For example, one is a Hanifbut he believes in his heart that, Ameen should be said aloud in Naamaz. Hebelieves in his heart to not say it would be blameworthy. Is it permissibleto take another ruling in this case, must he switch mathabs or must hesimply ignore what his heart tells him in regards to this issue?9. Does a scholar have to follow a mathab?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTaqleed means to follow.%0D%0AAllah Ta%E3la says in the Noble Qur%E3n, 'Ask the learned if you do not know'.%0D%0A). Since our knowledge is limited in Shari%E1h (Qur%E3n and Hadith), we are to%0D%0Afollow the learned %DAlama i.e. to make Taqleed and be a Muqallid.%0D%0A%0D%0ABefore we introduce the book, 'Taqleed' for your reading, note the following%0D%0Aexample:%0D%0AA surgeon performing an operation has a choice to use several methods to%0D%0Aperform the operation viz. Sir John, Hamiltom and Sir Conner's methods. All%0D%0Athese methods are correct. When applied, each method (individually) have to%0D%0Abe carried out in its entirety - the operation cannot be done by applying a%0D%0Alittle of the method of Sir John and a little of Sir Conner's and a little%0D%0Aof Hamilton. Despite all being correct applications, only one method of%0D%0Aapplication may be used for a particular operation each time. Similarly, a%0D%0AMuslim is required to follow one Madhab at a time so as not to confuse the%0D%0Avarious applications. It must be understood that the knowledge of the%0D%0ASahaaba (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) possessed is in no comparison to ours. Hence,%0D%0Aour understanding of the interpretations to the variations of each matter%0D%0Acould cause immeasurable confusion. We hope by reading this booklet, you%0D%0Awill have a clear understanding of the subject matter.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta%E3la Knows Best.%0D%0A%0D%0AWas salaam%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0A"
