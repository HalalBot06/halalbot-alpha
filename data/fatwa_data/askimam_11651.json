  "question": "Is permissible to: 1. Read Quran without wuzu from a digital Quran or reading by heart?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs permissible to: 1. Read Quran without wuzu from a digital Quran or reading by heart? 2. I use a stand to put the holy Quran on and read from it in a nafil prayer without touching it? 3. Why do we raise our hands in eid prayer takbeer but we don?t raise them in salat-ul-janaza?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Yes. Wudhu is a condition for touching the Quran not for reciting it. The screen of a digital Quran should not be touched without wudhu.\n\n2. According to the Hanafi Mazhab, it is not permissible to perform salah reading from the Quran, even if it is on a stand.\n\n3. The reason for not lifting the hands in every takbir of Janazah salah is that it is narrated from Nabi (sallahu Alaihi wasallam that he only lifted his hands for the first takbir of janazah salah. (Tirmizi Hadith no.1077, Darqutni Vol.2 Pg.75)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
