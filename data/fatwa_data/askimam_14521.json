ISNA (islamic society of north america)has decided to predetermine the beginning and end of ramadan based upon calculations. is this allowed or does the moon still have to be sighted by the naked eye?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe have studied the research of ISNA as prepared by Zul Fiqar Ali Shah of Millwaukee and found it to be flawed from many angles. We are busy preparing a response to that and will post on the site as soon as we have prepared our response.\n\nIt is compulsory to see the crescent with the naked eye.
