  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDoes it mean that a Muslim who is wearing long trousers will go to hell?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n \n\nRasulullah ( صلى الله عليه و سلّم    ) said \"Whatever flows below the ankle will burn in the fire\". There are many Ahadith that emphatically condemn having the garments below the ankles. In the above narrated Hadith, it is clear that whatever is below the ankles will certainly burn in the fire. Therefore, care must be taken that the garment/trouser is always above the ankle.\n\n \n\nGarments like Pants, Kurta, Jubba(cloak) should be trimmed so that they end above the ankles. This ruling applies to males.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nMufti Emraan Vawda\n\nDarul Iftaa"
