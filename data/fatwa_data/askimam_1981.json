  "question": "Is there anything wrong in wearing trousers and shirt in the western society rather than the Jubba?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn a Hadith to the nearest meaning, hte Prophet PBUH said, \"Whoever imitates a nation is from amongst them.\" ('Man ta shabbaha bi qawmin fahowa minhum'). Is this imitating the Kuffaar.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWith regard to pants and shirt, this mode of dressing has not been adopted by the learned and Allah-fearing, hence, attiring oneself in this fashion is not desirable. Moreover, a person would be deprived of the reward he would attain by adopting the Sunnah mode of attire. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyyah, vol.17 pg.349; Mahmoodiyyah)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
