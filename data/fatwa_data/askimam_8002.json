  "answer": "QUESTION\ni) What will be the status of wife in the akhirat ? ii) What about the wife if she has two or more husbands ? iii) The details of hadith, which states that \"We will be with our loved one in jannah\"\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. According to a narration of Tabrani, the wife will be superior to all the Hoors of the husband in Jannah. (Majmauz-zawaaid vol.10 pg.417)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. There are a few situations as explained by Allaamah ibn Hajar al-Haytami al-Makki (RA):%0D%0A%0D%0Aa. Either the woman had more than one husband, and each of them divorced her. In this case, she will be given a choice and Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has stated that she will choose the one who had the best character. (Tabrani; Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0Ab. A woman had married a few husbands. While she was in the marriage of the last husband she passed away, or he passed away and she did not remarry thereafter. In this case, she will be with the last husband. This is according to the narration of Sayyiduna Abud-Dardaa (Radhiallaahu Anhu) recorded by Imaams Tabrani and Abu Ya?alaa. Hafiz al-Buseeri has classified the narrators of the narration of Abu Ya?alaa as reliable. (Al-Itthaaf vol.5 pg.39). also refer to Fataawa al-Hadithiyya of Allamah ibn Hajar al-Haytami al-Makki (RA) pgs.48-49 and Kashful Khifaa vol.2 pg.265%0D%0A%0D%0A3. This Hadith has been recorded by Imaam Bukhari and Muslim in their Sahih and others as well. The general contents of these narrations indicate that if a person, is unable to carry out good deeds, but he has love for those who are able to do so, Almighty Allah will join him with those people in the lofty stages of Jannah. The word, ?love? in this Hadith does not refer to any sort of love, instead it refers to that love which is for the sake of Allah.
