  "question": "I bled for 5 days and on my 6th day my bleeding stopped and i started salah, that night i started taraweeh and next day started fasting for the first fast of ramadaan. After full 4 days of being paak, i began to bleed on Friday",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI was menstruating the week prior to ramadaan. I bled for 5 days and on my 6th day my bleeding stopped and i started salah, that night i started taraweeh and next day started fasting for the first fast of ramadaan. After full 4 days of being paak,Â i began to bleed on Friday. What is my position here. I have continued to fast till today as i regard this as sickness. Is this correct? What is the Islamic maslah on this..\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. If a woman who had a fixed habit of menstruating for 5 days and her bleeding stopped on the sixth day, thereafter she started bleeding again after being paak for four complete days. Then whatever Salaats she had read after the first five days of bleeding will be valid as well as her fasting because the bleeding she experienced after being paak for four days was due to sickness.\n\n2. If a woman did not have a fixed habit of bleeding for fix days every month, but she stopped bleeding on the sixth day and remained paak for 4 full days, thereafter she started bleeding again, then this Mas-alah is as follows: From the time she started bleeding till 10 days passed will be considered as menstruation, irrespective of whether she bled for full 10 days or she experienced being paak for four days and started bleeding again after that. 10 days will be considered as menstruation and the remainder bleeding she experiences will be considered as Istihaadha or sickness. In this case, she will have to keep Qadhaa of whatever fasts she had kept during that 10 day period of menstruation. However, she is excused from making Qadhaa of the Salaats she had read during that period. (Sharhul Wiqaayah vol.1 pg.115; Deoband)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
