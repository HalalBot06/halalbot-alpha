If the intention is to help and assist the person, one will not fall under the ambit of the Hadith. In fact one will be rewarded for sincerely helping a person from abstaining from wrong. Therefore if a person reports bad behaviour or habits of a child to his/her parent, he/she will not be guilty of exposing a person’s sin. It is also advisable that parents request responsible seniors of the community to keep a watchful eye on their children and report any misconduct or wrongs. This will enhance the moral fibre of our society and the young will always be on their guard from becoming involved in any sin or mischief.\n\n2.       Rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wasallam) said “Imaan is between fear and hope”. A believer is found in between these two conditions. Sometimes he is motivated by fear and sometimes by hope. Imaam Nawawi Rahimahullah states that a person should be governed by the fear of Allah whilst he/she is young and has the ability to commit sin. Similarly, a person should be dominated by the hope of Allah’s forgiveness when one becomes old and frail. It is a sign of true Imaan to be concerned of death and life after death. However, it is important that you strike a balance between your concern for death and life. You should continue with your life as normal and fulfil all your obligations to Allah and the creation. Your concern for death should lead you to a point where you become totally absorbed in this worry that you neglect your other duties to Allah and the creation. Sometimes Shaytaan uses these types of thoughts and whispers to mislead a person. It is therefore imperative that you identify a pious Alim who has benefited from other Ulama and take his guidance on issues such as these. You should not employ your own logic and believe that you on the correct path. Consult with the Ulama and let them guide you on every step of your spiritual strives.\n\n3.       As mentioned in 2 above, Shaytaan manipulates ones mind by injecting all these types of peculiar feelings and perceptions. Ignore all these voices and sounds and continue with your normal practice of performing Salaah, reciting the Quraan, Zikr etc. We reiterate that you should seek a spiritual guide who would assist you in these dilemmas.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
