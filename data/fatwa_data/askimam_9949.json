We are trying for the past 2 years. Please tell me some quarni duas to read so that god fullfil our dream of having kids. Please do respond to my question.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for responding to my mail. Sister, although you are 41 years old,%0D%0Aif Allah Ta'ala wills, you may have children. Only He knows what plans He%0D%0Ahas for you so do not despair.%0D%0AYou and your husband should perform Tahajjud salaah everyday and place your%0D%0Afull reliance on Him, the One who is Al-Mujeeb (the One who answers duas).%0D%0AIt will be very advantageous and beneficial for both of you to study a%0D%0Atafseer (plus translation) of the Holy Quran in depth in a language you%0D%0Aunderstand best. You will insha'allah gain further insight, understanding%0D%0Aand appreciation of why Allah Ta'ala has placed you on earth and what His%0D%0Aplans entail for you.%0D%0AI suggest that you read through the book with Allah Ta'ala's 99 beautiful%0D%0Anames%0D%0Aand choose the qualities which fit your needs and recite them frequently%0D%0Awith%0D%0Asincerity and full yaqeen in Allah Ta'ala.%0D%0AWe are totally dependent on Him for all our needs and%0D%0Aultimately we have to accept His final plan no matter how much we may%0D%0Afeel the lack or loss of an expectation.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala grant you pious children who will be the coolness of your%0D%0Aeyes.%0D%0AAmeen.%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best.%0D%0A%0D%0ASister Fadila%0D%0ASocial department%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
