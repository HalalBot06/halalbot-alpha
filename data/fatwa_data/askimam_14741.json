  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI want to ask you what to me mean by SALATHUL AASHIKEEN PRAYER;\n\nWhen should we pray this and want for.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere is no separate Salatul aashikeen prayer like tahiyyatul wudhu (salah after wudhu) and tahiyyatul masjid (salah when entering the musjid). The word aashikeen means the loved ones.  The salah of those who love Allah is filled with expressions of love and dedication.  Every posture of salah, qiyaam, ruku, sujood etc. is performed with due concentration and love.  This was the way Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam and his noble sahaba perfomed salah.  They regarded salah to be an opportunity to communicate with their beloved Allah and express their Ishk (love) for Allah\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\nThe guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\nEducation and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\nIslam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\nWhen one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\nMuslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\nWe have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\nIf you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\nIf that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\nRasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit”.\n\n \n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
