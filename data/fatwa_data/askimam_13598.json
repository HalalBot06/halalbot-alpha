  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni have a question to ask.my mother is sufering from diabetes n kidney stones problem due to which she cannot fast  during the month of ramzan and if she  tries to keep a fast then she has a problem passing urine which makes her fall into bed soon after she breaks her fast .so we recommended her not to fast as she is suffering from this type of problem.she has decided that she will feed a poor beggar everyday same food a she eats whenever shes not fasting.kindly tell me is this decision made by her correct.cos she also feels sad by not keeping fast as this is the only month to fast and if she tries to fast she faces this problem.please give the answer to this problem.jazakallah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to Shariah, if one is unable to fast due to ill health or sickness, he/she will be excused from fasting. Your mother will offer Fidyah to the poor and needy. The Fidyah is feeding one poor person one meal for every fast missed. Fidyah could also be given in cash according to the Sadqadul Fitr amount of your country for each missed fast.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
