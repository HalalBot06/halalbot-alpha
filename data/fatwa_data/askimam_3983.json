  "question": "I'm a married woman and I had relations with another man,though there was no consummation.I need to make sincere taubah.Please direct me toward the best possible form of repentence in this situation.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was involved with someone for a period of time, though there was no actual intercourse, there were other \"activities\". Please tell me if this constitutes full zina and what would be the best possible form of repentence that Allah (swt) would possibly accept. Jazakullah khairun.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah is Most Gracious and Most Merciful. He says in the Noble Qur'aan, 'Oh%0D%0AMy Slaves! Do not despair. Verily Allah will forgive all sins.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIn one Hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have%0D%0Asaid, 'If a person has sins equivalent to the foams of the sea and pebbles%0D%0Aon a desert, Allah's mercy is so encompassing that He will forgive every%0D%0Asin.' In another narration, it is mentioned that Allah will speak secretly%0D%0Ato one of His slaves on the day of Qiyaamat and remind him of all his sins.%0D%0AAfter the person will confess his sins, Allah will say to him, 'I concealed%0D%0Ayour faults in the world, today too, I will conceal your faults. Go in%0D%0AJannah, I have forgiven you.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above mentioned are few of many Ahaadith explaining the extent of%0D%0AAllah's Mercy. However, Allah says, 'Verily Allah will not forgive a person%0D%0Awho ascribe partners (commit Shirk) with Him.' The only sin that is%0D%0Aunforgivable is Kufr (disbelief) and Shirk (ascribing partners). Accepting%0D%0AIslam is the only atonement for the sin of Kufr and Shirk.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf one fulfils the conditions of repentance, i.e. regret and make firm%0D%0Aintention to reform, then surely Allah Ta'ala is Tawwaab (Most Forgiving)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
