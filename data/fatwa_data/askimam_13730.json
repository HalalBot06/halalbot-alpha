  "answer": "QUESTION\ncan we offer Namaz with our trousers foulded from the bottom as there are conflicting views on this issue. Is there any refference for this?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is prohibited to let the trousers flow below the ankles. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Allah does not look at a person with mercy who lets his trousers flow before his ankles.’\n\nThe ruling is generally irrespective of having pride or not. The prohibitions will be more severe in Salaat. One should fold his trousers above his ankles. There cannot be another view against an express Hadith.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
