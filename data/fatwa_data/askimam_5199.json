  "question": "Woud you please interpret some dreams for me.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaam Alaikum I would be grateful if you could interpret three dreams for me. 1. I dreamt that I was on a very long and large bridge, and my surroundings was undoubtedly the most beautiful place I have ever seen. At the end of the bridge was a sort of very very large building, even though it was very far it seemed very large. I didn?t look back so I don?t know what was there. The sky was a strange colour, like sunset colour and I could see images of horses near the ?building? in the sky. Below the bridge was a mass of water, not exactly a river and not a sea either, just a very large mass of water and I could see land after the water. I also remember saying to myself ?How can anyone have any doubt in God after seeing a scene such as this one?. 2. I have never had the privilege of going to Mecca but I really want to go and once, I prayed specifically so that I could go. The same night I had a dream that we were going on a trip with my family, but I don?t know where. I also remember telling one of my Christian friends that I will bring him a little Qu?ran as a souvenir. At the moment it still doesn?t seem likely that I?ll be going to Mecca so I don?t know if it has any significance. 3. I also had a dream that I delivered the baby of another woman. Wa Salaam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlhamdulillah, all the dreams are an indication of your Imaan.\n\nMay Allah Ta'ala take you and all of us to Makkah Mukarramah, Aameen. You\nshould continue making Du'aa. Nothing is impossible for Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
