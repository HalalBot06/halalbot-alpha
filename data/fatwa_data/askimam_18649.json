  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\n1)I am staying in Saudi Arabia.    Last year I purchased a car and took  only a third party insurance for my vehicle because I know that full cover insurance is haram for muslim. Now I heard that “a family included 2 children’s were travelled in car with car owner and accident had happened. All of travelers except driver and children’s were died. The case was taken over by police and submitted in to the court. Court ordered to the owner that “he have to pay the some amount of money to that children’s who were travelled with him when the accident has happened.\n\nThe question is\n\nIn this case, the owner should have to pay personally this amount if he hasn’t full cover insurance.\n\nSo why full cover insurance is still haram\n\n \n\n2) when my wife has completed her bathing too much hair being falling. have we keep  this hear and should buried in sand? Or can we allow to flow with water to the drainage?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\n1.       In principle, all forms of insurance, be it life insurance, short term insurance or third party insurance of motor vehicles, properties, businesses, houses or other assets are not permissible in Islām due to the fact that there exists two unlawful aspects which are directly complicated in all insurance schemes. The first being interest and the second being gambling. When a person pays his monthly premiums, if in the case of any loss a far greater amount is received to cover one’s losses. This is where the aspect of interest falls in. As far as gambling is concerned, one will never know when a loss is going to be afflicted, therefore it is a game of chance. Similarly here also in the case of a loss, one will receive benefits that are far greater in excess than the premiums paid in.\n\n \n\nIt is for these reasons Shari’ah does not permit insurance. However, if one is obliged by the law of the country as is the case in Saudi Arabia, then he/she will be excused. Therefore, if one subscribes to third party insurance and this fulfills the legal requirements, it will not be permissible to subscribe to full cover insurance etc.\n\n 2.      It is preferable and out of honour that the hair which falls off be buried since it is part of the body.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\nMl.
