  "question": "Ya Shaykh, what if a person is in search of truth and goes astray? I want to learn about Islam, i live in UAE, do you know anyone from UAE who can help me?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nJanab Mufti Sahab, in connection to my first question, what i mean to say is, if someone is looking for the truth (Sahih Aqeedah, Ahlus Sunnah, etc.) and in search of the truth, he ends up following the wrong sect. Will he be held responsible? I mean, if he was so confused (as there are so many sects) and he ended up following the wrong one, although his intention was to follow Ahlus Sunnah, what will happen to such a person on Qiyamat? Example, i accept most your fatawaa, but since i live in a Salafi country, they don't really like you, as you are not Salafi. They think i have gone astray in following you. Wa Allahu Alim. That is why i ask you to give me the contact of any scholar you know in UAE, in Sharjah hopefully. Jazaak Allah Khair !\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBy you searching for the truth, Allah will guide you. It is not which group\nyou follow but that which you follow must be in accordance with the Shariah\nAs Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said I leave behind two things if you\nfollow them you would not go astray the Quraan and my Sunnah. This has to be\nyour bases to to your beliefs and in order for you to understand these two\nsources you need to refer to the Ahlul-Ilm (people of knowledge).\n\nIn UAE, you may contact Shaykh Taqi-u-ddin Nadwi.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
