  "question": "Quick (real quick) ways to boost ones imaan...After coming to the UK in 1991 I still followed Islam as it was until I reached puberty, when I started watch haram material (porn).",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nFrom a very young age I (allahamdolila) followed Islam as it was, also had an excellent memory (from my teachers saying). After coming to the UK in 1991 I still followed Islam as it was until I reached puberty, when I started watch haram material (porn). @ First I would get some urge from my stomach and chest, This always (even now) happened whenever I had the urge to watch porn. After starting this habit I had 2 different dreams which came back 2 me again and again very often. I spoke to an armli (although I figured out the meanings of the dreams my self after some time) and told me that, ?these dreams are warnings, a reminder to the reality of life and was luck enough to b reminded? @ first when I watched that stuff I would feel sick and almost vomit, and would be very angry with myself and do many goods to try ?n counteract the deeds. I no long have these feelings after watching it (which is a sign of my heart darkening) PLZ tell me any ways that I can stop this terror able disease and boost my imam quickly. (another sign is that I have seen my memory & learning abilities rapidly drop since starting this habit).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlhamdulillah , that you have taken the first step to reformation and that is confiding your problem in us. It is very good that you realize the evils of pornography. The solution is that you have to stop watching it and that will only come about with a firm determination and by staying away from all things which inflame ones desires viz..looking at females, thinking about them,speaking to them or about them etc. You should find good company and make sure that you do not even go close to youngsters who indulge in these and other similar evils. %0D%0A%0D%0AMake sure that you keep yourself busy all the time and stay constantly engaged in the zikr of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0AFind a senior Alim or pious person and try to keep his company as often as possible.%0D%0A%0D%0AOne of the best ways to boost your imam is to speak repeatedly about the greatness of Allah and that it is He who is watching us all the time and that He has complete power over us. Try your best to join the local jamaat movement. Thousand nay millions of youth all over the world found their lives completely transformed by going out in the path of Allah for a few days with these brothers, whose only concern day and night is how every person can be saved from the fire of Jahanum and can enter Jannah and earn the pleasure of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhenever you feel evil thoughts coming to your mind read:A'oozu billahi minash shaytaanir rajeem Aamantu billahi Warasoolihi.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah grant you a quick recovery%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
