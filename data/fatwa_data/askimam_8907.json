  "question": "Is it written in the holy Quran somewhere that shaytaan is the king of Darkness? If so wht is the meaning of it? And wht maximum shaytaan can do to believers?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n2.And also wht are the timings of chaast salah and its virtues? thank you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There is no verse in the Qur?aan that the Shaytaan is the king of darkness. However, the Qur?aan is replete with verses about Shaytaan being our open and avowed enemy. Following Shaytaan will be a means of one?s darkness on the day of Qiyaamat. The relationship of Shaytaan with man is balanced with guidance to man from Allah Ta?ala and His Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). It is not a one sided issue that man is only exposed to the misguidance and evils of Shaytaan. Man is also guided with righteousness by Allah and His Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Allah has given man the rational and ability to do as he wants. If he follows Shaytaan, it is his choice and hence he will be punished. He will be rewarded for doing good as that too is due to his choice.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The virtues of Chaast Salaat (Salaat al-Dhuhaa) are many. In one Hadith, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, ?That person who performs 2 Rakaats of Chaast Salaat, he will not be counted from among the neglectful ones and the one who performs 4 Rakaats of Chaast he will be recorded from the worshippers and the one that reads 6 Rakaats, it will suffice for him on behalf of any optional act for that day and the one that performs 8 Rakaats, Allah will count him to be from among the obedient ones and the one the performs 12 Rakaats Allah will build for him a house in Jannah.? (Al-Tabrani) The best time to read Chast is when quarter of the day has passed, otherwise it could be read from after sunrise uptil before midday.
