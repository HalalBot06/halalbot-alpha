  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan muslims use flouride based toothpaste?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nMuslims can use fluoride based toothpaste since fluoride is derived from a natural mineral found in the earth's crust.\n\n \n\nWhile evaluating toothpaste's its best to contact the manufacturer to see if any ingredients are derived from animal sources.\n\n \n\nThe Jamiyatul Ulema of Canada, has noted that Glycerol (E-422, Glycerin) is found in some toothpastes – and can be derived from two sources: petroleum products or animal fat. If the Glycerol is from petroleum products then it is halal. If its from animal fat, then it's haram.1 2\n\n \n\nAlternatively, the Muslim Consumer Group, contacts manufacturers of products and lists information about ingredients on their site as well. You may visit the following site, and type in “toothpaste” to see a list of halal toothpastes to use:  http://www.muslimconsumergroup.com/Product.do?menu=Product&eventAction=personalcare\n\n \n\nKeep in mind that ingredient sources do change – so check regularly or keep in touch with the manufacturer.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\nMl.
