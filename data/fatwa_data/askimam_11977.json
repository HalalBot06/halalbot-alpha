  "question": "I am a Mauritian working in South Africa. Can I use interest money? to pay for air tickets for my old uncles/aunts to visit me from Mauritius?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI want to buy a house. I have contacted the Islamic Bank; they refuse to give an Islamic loan, as I am mot a Permanent Resident. Can I take an interest loan from a normal bank? Wassalam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If your uncles and aunts are poor and needy, and they are eligible to accept Zakaat, then they may be given interest monies. They will be the owners of the monies given to them and they may use the monies as they wish. However, we discourage giving interest and Zakaat to people to carry out acts of comfort and luxury. The purpose of such monies is to fulfil the basic needs of the poor and needy and make them independent of begging. We advise you give your uncles and aunts such monies to fulfil their basic needs back home.\n\n2. It is not permissible for you to take an interest loan from a bank to purchase a house. Your need can be fulfilled through renting a house.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
