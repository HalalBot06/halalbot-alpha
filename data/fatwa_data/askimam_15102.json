  "question": "Someone told me i will be gifted with a power from Allah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamu alaikum\n\nAbout three years ago I was told by someone who helped me through a difficult time in my life that I had  a gift that was given by Allah swa. He said that only in a few years when I am ready it will really start. He is also A gifted person. He said that my gift is much stronger than his and that i will be able to help people in there difficult times. And that he was sent to give me this message. At the same time I  was expecting this person to bring me this message. Whenever he comes to my house I can feel that he is coming. Is this strange and am I crazy to believe in something like this? Should I put all of this in the past?\n\nRecently I have been getting all these strange dreams about my life and I feel myself being pulled into a different world where I have to change my whole lifestyle. What does this mean?\n\nHow do know if this gift is true? My parents do not believe in these things. I feel that am battling spiritually within myself.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nYou should not pay attention to the so called gift. The information by the person is misleading. Your parents are correct as there is no basis for such information. Follow the advise and guidance of your parents.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
