  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Destruction of Statues Displayed in an Islamic State%0D%0A%0D%0AStatues%0D%0A%0D%0AStatues have been severely condemned in numerous verses of the Holy Qur%E1an%0D%0Aand an abundant number of Ahaadith of Nabi Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam. To%0D%0Amentioned these in detail would require a few volumes. We suffice here with%0D%0Aa few examples.%0D%0A%0D%0AQur%E1an%0D%0A%0D%0AWhat, do they (the mushrikeen) take gods (made) of earth, which they carry%0D%0Aabout. (Surah Ambiyaah Aayat 21).%0D%0A%0D%0ASurely those that are worshipped besides Allah (i.e. the idols), they cannot%0D%0Acreate anything, (but) are themselves created, (and they are) dead (and) not%0D%0Aalive. (Surah Nahl Aayat 21)%0D%0A%0D%0ASurely those that you call out to (i.e. worship) besides Allah (i.e. the%0D%0Aidols), they cannot create a single fly, even if all of them had to gather%0D%0Afor this purpose. And should a fly snatch anything from them they cannot%0D%0Aprevent the fly from doing so. (Surah Haj Aayat 73)%0D%0A%0D%0AWhat, do they attribute as a partner (unto Allah) that which cannot create%0D%0Aanything (i.e. the idols), whereas they (i.e. the idols) are themselves%0D%0Acreated, and they are unable to assist anyone, nor are they themselves%0D%0Aassisted. If you had to call them towards guidance, they will not follow%0D%0Ayou. It is both equal to them that you call them or you remain silent.%0D%0ASurely those that you (O Mushrikeen) call out to (i.e. you worship) besides%0D%0AAllah (i.e. the idols), they are slaves like you. Therefore call onto them%0D%0Aand see if they reply, if you are true (in your claim). Do they have feet by%0D%0Ameans of which they may walk, do they have hands by means of which they may%0D%0Agrab, do they have eyes by means of which they may see, do they have ears by%0D%0Ameans of which they may hear.. (Surah A'raaf Aayat 179)%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala has mentioned the incident of Hazrat Ibraaheem Alayhis Salaam%0D%0Abreaking the idols a number of times in the Qur%E1an.%0D%0A%0D%0AAhaadith%0D%0A%0D%0ANarrated Ibn `Abbas (Radiyallahu anhuma): When Allah's Apostle came to%0D%0AMakkah, he refused to enter the Ka`ba with idols in it. He ordered that the%0D%0Aidols be taken out). (Bukhari 2.671)%0D%0A%0D%0ANarrated `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (Radiyallahu anhu): The Prophet entered%0D%0AMakkah and (at that time) there were three hundred-and-sixty idols around%0D%0Athe Ka`ba. He started stabbing the idols with a stick he had in his hand and%0D%0Areciting: \"Truth (Islam) has come and Falsehood (disbelief) has vanished.\"%0D%0A(Bukhari 3.658)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is reported from Abul al-Hayaj al-Asadi who said 'Ali bin Abu Talib%0D%0A(Radiyallahu anhu) told me: \"Should I not instruct you to do as the%0D%0AMessenger of Allah Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam instructed me? Do not leave a%0D%0Astatue standing without removing it. Do not leave a grave raised without%0D%0Aleveling it.\" (Naylul Awtaar vol.4 pg.83)%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat 'Amr b. 'Abasa Sulami (Radiyallahu anhu) reported: (Before becoming a%0D%0AMuslim) I said to Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam: Who are you? He%0D%0Asaid: I am a Prophet (of Allah). I again said: Who is a Prophet? He said: (I%0D%0Aam a Prophet in the sense that) I have been sent by Allah. I said: What is%0D%0Athat which you have been sent with? He said: I have been sent to join ties%0D%0Aof relationship (with kindness and affection), to break the Idols, and to%0D%0Aproclaim the oneness of Allah (in a manner that) nothing is to be associated%0D%0Awith Him. (Muslim Book 4, Number 1812 Chapter 142: HOW 'AMR B. 'ABASA%0D%0AEMBRACED ISLAM )%0D%0A%0D%0AThere cannot be anything more abhorrent in Islam than statues and idols. It%0D%0Awas one of the primary duties of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam to%0D%0Adestroy idols. He was sent for this purpose. He instructed Hazrat Ali%0D%0A(Radiyallahu anhu) not to leave any statue standing. At the very first%0D%0Aopportunity, he demolished the idols found in Makkah Mukarramah. Therefore,%0D%0Aany person with a clear mind, unclouded by ramblings of those that deny%0D%0AAllah, can understand that there can be no place whatsoever for idols in%0D%0AIslam. It is the very antithesis of Islam. The very doctrine of the Deen is%0D%0Ain diametrical opposition to the keeping of statues and idols.%0D%0A%0D%0AMost unfortunately, some Muslims of weak Imaan have been put into doubt over%0D%0Asuch a clear-cut issue. To remove their doubts, we will discuss a few%0D%0Aarguments in favor of non-interference with idols.%0D%0A%0D%0AOffensive%0D%0A%0D%0AThe primary argument presented is that the destruction of idols is offensive%0D%0Ato the religious convictions of certain communities. Islam teaches us to%0D%0Arespect the religious beliefs of non-Muslims.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnswer%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is wrong to say that Islam teaches us to respect the religious beliefs of%0D%0Anon-Muslims. To respect the beliefs of others means to respect kufr and%0D%0Ashirk. This is totally unacceptable.%0D%0A%0D%0AYes, what we do respect is their right to practice their religion. In other%0D%0Awords, despite the fact that we intensely abhor their beliefs, should they%0D%0Awish to practice on those beliefs, we will grant them the freedom to do so.%0D%0AThis too is on condition that it does not conflict with our interests.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs far as our attitude being offensive, well, if the truth be told, the%0D%0Awhole of Islam is offensive to some of the kuffaar. Even our kalimah is%0D%0Aoffensive to the mushrikeen. Our kalima denounces all deities besides Allah%0D%0ATa'ala as false. This emphatically implies that the gods of the mushrikeen%0D%0Aare false.%0D%0A%0D%0ASo are we going to abandon our kalima because it is offensive to some of the%0D%0Akuffaar? Certainly not!%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the same light there are numerous teachings of Islam which are offensive%0D%0Ato one community or the other. Are we then going to discard these teachings%0D%0Amerely because someone is offended?%0D%0A%0D%0AAre we then going to court the pleasure of the kuffaar at the expense of%0D%0Aearning the displeasure of our Creator Allah Subhaanahu wa Ta'ala?%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is obvious that by acting on the law of Allah Ta'ala we will be earning%0D%0Athe rebuke of the kuffaar, for Islam and kufr are two diametrically opposed%0D%0Aideologies. There is thus no surprise in their criticism.%0D%0A%0D%0A%3EFrom the very first day of Islam they have been ridiculing and rebuking%0D%0AMuslims, then this has continued through the ages, and will continue until%0D%0AQiyaamah. Thus these criticisms will not deter us in the least. Regarding%0D%0Athe true Mu'mineen, Allah Ta'ala says in the Holy Qur%E1an: \"And they do not%0D%0Afear the rebuke of any rebuking person\". (Surah An'aam Aayat 54)%0D%0A%0D%0AWhat we Muslims should only be concerned with is whether our actions are%0D%0Awithin the laws of Allah Ta'ala.%0D%0A%0D%0AThus the offense of the kuffaar holds no weight with us.%0D%0A%0D%0AFREEDOM OF RELIGION%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Islamic State extracts a tax from the non-Muslim citizens of the state.%0D%0ABy virtue of this tax they are granted complete freedom of religion. Thus if%0D%0Atheir religion supports idols, we have no right to interfere with the idols%0D%0Afor this will be in conflict with the freedom of religion which they are%0D%0Aguaranteed.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnswer%0D%0A%0D%0AFirstly, let us not be fooled by the term \"freedom of religion\". There is no%0D%0Aabsolute \"freedom of religion\". There is not a single state on earth that%0D%0Agrants it's citizens absolute freedom of religion. Even though such clauses%0D%0Aappear in the constitutions of many States, it is a relative term. Should%0D%0Aanyone's personal religious convictions and practices conflict with the%0D%0Ainterests of the state, then such religious practices will be outlawed.%0D%0A%0D%0ASo just as every other state on earth gives preference to its own interests%0D%0Aover the religious convictions of any citizen, similarly too does the%0D%0AIslamic state give preference to its own objectives.%0D%0A%0D%0AAn Islamic state is established with the sole purpose of establishing the%0D%0ADeen of Allah Ta'ala on Allah's earth. The prime object is to entrench Islam%0D%0Ain the land. Should any individual's personal interests be in conflict with%0D%0Athis objective, preference will obviously be given to the Deen. The Islamic%0D%0AState is established for the Deen, and not for any particular individual or%0D%0Agroup. This will apply to even Muslim citizens. Should their personal ideals%0D%0Abe in conflict with that of Islam, the ideals of Islam would reign superior.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhile the non-Muslim citizens do have the right to practice their religion%0D%0Ain Daarul Islam, this is subject to certain conditions. The need for these%0D%0Aconditions arises from the fact that, should they be granted absolute%0D%0Afreedom, some of their actions would come in conflict with the objectives of%0D%0Athe State. Some of these conditions will be discussed below.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Jizyah which the non-Muslim citizens of Daarul Islam (an Islamic State)%0D%0Apay does not grant them \"complete freedom of religion\" but rather guarantees%0D%0Athem three rights:%0D%0A%0D%0ASecurity of life: It is the duty of the Islamic State to guarantee the%0D%0Asanctity of life.%0D%0ASecurity of property and honour. Similarly the Islamic State has to provide%0D%0Asecurity to their property. No one has the right to usurp their wealth. In%0D%0Athe same light, no one may attack their honour; e.g. no one may backbite or%0D%0Aslander the non-Muslim citizen. Retribution will be taken from anyone%0D%0Aviolating their rights.%0D%0ATheir right to practice their religion, subject to conditions.%0D%0AConditions:%0D%0A%0D%0AWhile the conditions under which non-Muslims are granted citizenship of%0D%0ADaarul Islam are many, at this juncture we refer to only those that are%0D%0Arelative to our discussion.%0D%0A%0D%0ASome of these conditions are:%0D%0A%0D%0AThey may practice their religion within the privacy of their homes%0D%0A%0D%0AThey may not build any new churches, synagogues etc.%0D%0A%0D%0AShould any church, synagogue etc. be destroyed or require repair, they may%0D%0Arepair or rebuild such buildings.%0D%0A%0D%0AThey may not celebrate any religious festivals in public%0D%0A%0D%0AThey may not display in public any item having particular religious purport,%0D%0Ae.g. bible, Cross, statue, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0ASuch items should also be removed from the exterior of their places of%0D%0Aworship i.e. No idol, Cross etc may be displayed on the outside of their%0D%0Aplaces of worship.%0D%0A%0D%0AThey may not ring the church bell, nor read their religious books so loud%0D%0Athat it is audible in public.%0D%0A%0D%0AThey may not invite towards their religion.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe reason for these conditions is that the purpose of Daarul Islam is to%0D%0Aentrench Islam on the earth. Thus the salient features in religion must only%0D%0Abe that of Islam. No features of other religions may be observable in%0D%0Apublic.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is only when Muslims firmly enforced such laws that Islam reigned%0D%0Asuperior on earth. Thus the object for which Daarul Islam was established%0D%0Ahad been achieved.%0D%0A%0D%0AEarly in Islamic history, the khalifas were mindful of enforcing these laws,%0D%0Ahence Islam was the only religion to be seen in public. The result of this%0D%0Awas that over the generations, non-Muslims entered into Islam in droves%0D%0AThere was absolutely no forced conversions, but the air was filled only with%0D%0AIslam. The atmosphere was only of the Deen of Allah, as it rightfully aught%0D%0Ato be. Thus, while freedom of choice existed, the kuffaar voluntarily%0D%0Aentered into Islam in such large numbers that Islam soon conquered the major%0D%0Alands of the civilized world of that time.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala in particular reward the two Umars, Ameerul Mu'mineen%0D%0AHazrat Umar bin Khattaab (Radiyallahu anhu) and Hazrat Umar bin Abdul Aziz%0D%0A(rahimahullah), for they were vigilant in enforcing these essential rules of%0D%0Athe state. Thus Islam flourished under their leadership.%0D%0A%0D%0ARegarding the conditions under which non-Muslims will be allowed to reside%0D%0Ain an Islamic state, Ibn Taymiyyah writes that there exists a unanimous%0D%0Aconsensus of the fuqaha, and the entire Ummah on these conditions. He then%0D%0Amentions:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"And from amongst these conditions are those that are related to the kuffaar%0D%0Aconcealing the evils of their religion, and not exhibiting these evils.%0D%0AExamples of these are the prohibition of them displaying Khamr (wine), or%0D%0Athe church bell or yoke; the prohibition of publicly celebrating their%0D%0Afestivals and the like thereof. . Also, they may not expose any of the%0D%0Asalient features of their religion. E.g. they may not raise their voices%0D%0Awhen reciting their scriptures....%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Umar (Radiyallahu anhu) and all the Muslims after him, including all%0D%0Athe Ulama, are unanimous that the non-Muslims are prohibited from exposing%0D%0Ain Daarul Islam (an Islamic state) anything that may be particularly%0D%0Aassociated with their religion. Particular emphasis was placed on the%0D%0Ainjunction that no feature of the mushrikeen (idol worshippers) should ever%0D%0Abe displayed in Daarul Islam.. This was in obedience to Allah and His%0D%0ARasool (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam), and in conformity to the Qur%E1an, while%0D%0Aholding firm to the Sunnah of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam)\" (I'%0D%0Alaa-us sunan Pg. 520 Vol. 12; Idaratul Qa'raan)%0D%0A%0D%0ASome of the conditions under which the non-Muslims had willfully adopted%0D%0Acitizenship of Daarul Islam, and which were proposed by Hazrat Umar%0D%0A(Radiyallahu anhu), are:%0D%0A%0D%0AWe will not sell liquor.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe will not display the Cross on our churches, or any other public place.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe will only ring our church bells softly, and only from within [and not%0D%0Aoutside] our churches.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe will not raise our voices during prayers.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe will not display the yoke at any public place.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe will not celebrate the festivals of Easter and Palm Sunday.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe will not call towards our religion.%0D%0A%0D%0A(Al Mughni Vol. 10 pg. 606 as quoted in I'laa-us sunan pg. 520 vol. 12.)%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen Abu Ubaida ib Jarraah (Radiyallahu anhu) conquered Shaam (Syria), he%0D%0Astipulated similar condition on the non-Muslim citizens as Hazrat Umar%0D%0A(Radiyallahu anhu) used to stipulate. The Christians thereafter requested to%0D%0Abe allowed to celebrate one day of festivity within the year, in which they%0D%0Aare allowed to display the Cross. Hazrat Abu Ubaida-tubnul Jarraah wrote to%0D%0AHazrat Umar (Radiyallahu anhu), and received this reply:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"They may celebrate one day of festivity within every year. They may only%0D%0Adisplay the Cross outside the city. As far as within the city, or the Muslim%0D%0Apublic, they may not display the Cross. This is only for this particular%0D%0Aday. They may not display the cross on any other day. (Even outside the%0D%0Acities)\" (I'laa-us sunan pg. 520 vol. 12)%0D%0A%0D%0AUmar bin Abdul Aziz (rahimahullah) wrote to his governor such:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"Do not leave a cross exposed. Should you find one, demolish and efface it.\"%0D%0A(I'laa-us sunan pg. 520 vol. 12; Idaratul Qur'aan)%0D%0A%0D%0AThese quotations bear ample testimony to the fact that religious symbols may%0D%0Anot be publicly displayed in Daarul Islam.%0D%0A%0D%0AEgypt%0D%0A%0D%0ASome have claimed that when Hazrat Umar (Radiyallahu anhu) conquered Egypt,%0D%0Ahe allowed statues to remain. Hence they are standing till this day, e.g.%0D%0Athe sphinx or the thousands of artifacts on view at the Egyptian National%0D%0AMuseum. This indicates that we should not interfere with such statues.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnswer%0D%0A%0D%0AThe fact that these statues \"are standing today\" does not imply that Hazrat%0D%0AUmar (Radiyallahu anhu) \"allowed statues to remain\".%0D%0A%0D%0AAlmost all the statues found today in Egypt were unearthed in the last%0D%0Acentury. Hazrat Umar (Radiyallahu anhu) conquered Egypt in 20 AH. At that%0D%0Atime these statues were unknown of, both out of sight and out of mind. Thus%0D%0Ait cannot be claimed that Hazrat Umar (Radiyallahu anhu) condoned the%0D%0Adisplay of statues.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe only statue that may have been in public display would have been the%0D%0Asphinx. But it would have been impractical to destroy such a huge mass of%0D%0Arock. Consider the size of the sphinx. It is about 20 m (66 ft) high and%0D%0Aabout 73 m (240 ft) long.[1]%0D%0A%0D%0AAt that time there were no modern implements, hence it would have been%0D%0Aimpractical to remove this rock by mere pick and shovel. The impracticality%0D%0Acan be gauged from the fact that French canons could not demolish the%0D%0Asphinx, but only managed to cause some damage.%0D%0A%0D%0AFurthermore, consider the hard facts. Hazrat Umar (Radiyallahu anhu)%0D%0Astrictly enforced the rule of not allowing non-Muslims to display their%0D%0Areligious symbols in public. He refused the Christians permission to display%0D%0Athe Cross within the city, even if only once a year.%0D%0A%0D%0AWould he then condone the public display of statues?%0D%0A%0D%0AThe assumption that he \"allowed statues to stand\" is in conflict with his%0D%0Ageneral position, a position attested to by many historical facts. Thus the%0D%0Aassumption must be dismissed as baseless.%0D%0A%0D%0ABear in mind that we have only discussed his attitude towards the Cross. The%0D%0Across is a religious symbol, and not an idol or image. Yet since it is a%0D%0Asalient feature of the Christians, they were not allowed to publicly display%0D%0Ait in Daarul Islam. All publicly displayed crosses were to be demolished, as%0D%0Ahas been established from the decree of Hazrat Umar bin Abdul Aziz%0D%0A(rahimahullah).%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen this is the position of symbol, then to a far greater degree should%0D%0Athis apply to statues which are intended to be images of and represent false%0D%0Agods, and which have become objects of worship within themselves.%0D%0A%0D%0AThus, to a far greater degree should their display be outlawed. Is it within%0D%0Areasoning to claim that Hazrat Umar (Radiyallahu anhu) would forbid the%0D%0Adisplay of the Cross but condone the display of idols? The stupidity of such%0D%0Aa claim is self-evident.%0D%0A%0D%0AInstigate%0D%0A%0D%0ASome have quoted the Aayat of the Qur%E1an.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"And do not swear those that call upon deities besides Allah (i.e. the%0D%0Aidols), for they (the mushrikeen) will swear Allah out of enmity (and%0D%0Aretribution), without having knowledge.\" (Surah An'aam Aayat 108)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn this Aayat we are prohibited from instigating the kuffaar towards being%0D%0Aantagonistic to Islam. By destroying idols, we are provoking a negative%0D%0Aresponse and eliciting enmity towards Muslims. Hence we should not do so.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnswer%0D%0A%0D%0AThere is absolutely no need for Muslims to swear the mushrikeen. Thus%0D%0AMuslims are prohibited from doing so when their action creates a negative%0D%0Areaction. The swearing of the mushrikeen serves no other purpose besides%0D%0Ainvoking enmity.%0D%0A%0D%0AOn the other hand the demolishing of idols displayed in Daarul Islam is a%0D%0Areligious duty. Unlike swearing the mushrikeen, it has a purpose, which is%0D%0Ato ensure that the atmosphere in Daarul Islam is only that of Islam. Thus it%0D%0Ais a necessary duty. In carrying out our Islamic duties we fear not the%0D%0Arebuke of anyone.%0D%0A%0D%0AYes, if our futile acts may cause enmity, we should desist from these futile%0D%0Aacts, as they serve no Islamic purpose.%0D%0A%0D%0ASecondly, if this aayat implied that we should not destroy the idols, then%0D%0Awhy on the occasion of conquest of Makkah did Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) destroy the idols? Do the defendants of idols wish to claim that%0D%0Athey understood the Qur%E1an better than Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam)?%0D%0A%0D%0AIn brief, we thus conclude that the destruction of idols displayed in Daarul%0D%0AIslam is an incumbent duty of the Islamic government, and doubts on this%0D%0Aissue are founded on baseless arguments.%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Imraan Vawda%0D%0AAssistant Mufti - Madrasah In'aamiyyah, Camperdown"
