  "question": "Please relate the hadith about sahabah & munafiq father whom the sahabah confronted at the city gates.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nInsha'Allah, I would like to have the hadith and its isnad with a statement of its level of authenticity. There is a hadith about a munafiq who used to secretly insult Rasulullah (S.A.W.). His son found out about it when the father was out of town on a journey. The son confronted the father at the gates to the town upon his return and threatened to execute his munafiq father on the spot if he did not take back everything that he had said against Rasulullah (S.A.W.). The munafiq took back the words, so the son didn't execute him. Word of all this got back to Rasulullah (S.A.W.) who did not object. May Allah (S.W.T.) bless you and reward you for your efforts. JazakAllahair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Munaafiqeen referred to in this incident was Abdullah ibn Ubayy, who was%0D%0Athe notorious leader of the Munaafiqeen.%0D%0A%0D%0AImaam Bukhari (RA) has recorded several narrations of the following Hadith%0D%0Ain his Chapter on Tafsir (Sahih Bukhari vol.2 pg.728; Deoband), most%0D%0Adetailed among these are the narrations of Ali ibn Madini and al-Humaidi%0D%0A(two teachers of Imaam Bukhari) from Sufyaan ibn Uyaynah from Amr ibn%0D%0ADinaar who narrates from Jaabir (Radhiallaahu Anhu).%0D%0A%0D%0AThese narrations are similar in content. In the interest of brevity, only%0D%0Athe narration of Ali (RA) will be quoted. Jaabir (Radhiallaahu Anhu) says,%0D%0A'We were with Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) on a campaign, one when a%0D%0AMuhaajir kicked an Ansaari. The Ansari called out, 'Up, people of the%0D%0AAnsaar!' Then, then Muhaajir called out for the Muhajireen, 'Up, people of%0D%0Athe Muhajireen!' Each calling to his fraternity for support.%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) heard this and reprimanded, 'What are%0D%0Athese calls of Jaahiliyyah (period of ignorance) I hear?' They complained to%0D%0Ahim that a Muhajir kicked an Ansari. He replied, 'Overlook it, indeed it%0D%0A(practices of Jaahiliyya) bring an evil stench.' When Abdullah ibn Ubayy%0D%0A(the Munaafiq) heard this, he remarked, 'What! Have they been shown%0D%0Afavouritism? If we get back to Madinah, the honourable will certainly expel%0D%0Athe despised one (referring to Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).'%0D%0A%0D%0ANews of this reached Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Umar (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhu), (who was present this time) rose and said, 'Oh Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), grant me leave to strike off the head of this%0D%0AMunaafiq.' Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) answered, 'Spare him. People%0D%0Ashould not find an opportunity to say that Muhammad kills his companions.'%0D%0AJaabir (Radhiallaahu Anhu) says, 'The Ansaar outnumbered the Muhajireen when%0D%0Athey (Muhajireen) first arrived in Madinah, thereafter, the numbers of the%0D%0AMuhaajireen increased. (Sahih Bukhari vol.2 pg.728; Deoband)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn Sunan Tirmidhi, the same Hadith is narrated from Sufyan by Ibn Umar. At%0D%0Athe end of the Hadith, Imaam Tirmidhi (RA) comments that others relating the%0D%0AHadith from Jabir (Radhiallaahu Anhu) besides Amr ibn Dinaar have also%0D%0Arelated the following: 'The son of Abdullah ibn Ubayy (whose name was also%0D%0AAbdullah) said to him, 'You will never enter until you declare that you are%0D%0Athe despised one and Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is honourable.' He,%0D%0Athen did so. Thereafter, Imaam Tirmidhi states, 'This is a good Sahih%0D%0A(authentic) Hadith.' (Tirmidhi vol.2 pg.168; HM Saeed)%0D%0A%0D%0AOther narrations include Abdullah's request that he be granted permission to%0D%0Akill his father, which Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) refused as has%0D%0Abeen recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim from Uqayl from Dhuhri who narrates from Urwa%0D%0Aibn Zubayr and Amr ibn Thabit (Radhiallaahu Anhum). This Isnad is Mursal but%0D%0Ahas been certified by Hafiz Ibn Hajar (RA) as acceptable. (Fathul Bari vol.8%0D%0Apg.837; Qadeemi)%0D%0A%0D%0AIshaaq (RA) in his famous Al-Maghaazi and Tabari have also included this.%0D%0A(Ibid pg.838)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
