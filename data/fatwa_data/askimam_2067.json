I have already completed 4 yrs of madrassa in Detroit under two ulema (Maulana Zubair and Maulana Haroon).I have critical financial condition and reponsibilties but I want to complete my alim course please advise me where should I continue. Please advise me if I could come to SA and study under you.I had left the madrassa with my teachers permission with the intention to come back to my home city(minneapolis,MN) to make arrangements to go overseas and continue my studies. But I got sidetracked by Shaytan and my nafs. I sincerely want to continue my studies inshallah to help in teaching the true deen here in my hometown because there are no ulema here and many muslim are being led astray by these ignorant\"Self taught scholars\". When left the madrassa I had already started my kitaabs in Arabic(eg Nurul-idhah and Hidayatun-Nahwi). I truly want to continue my deeni studies inshAllah..so again I ask for your advice and dua.Please respond as soon as you are able to inshAllah. JazakAllahu khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazaakumullah for your email.\n\nYou are most welcome to come and study at your institute. However, we\nrequire details of your present condition, viz. your marital status and what\nyou mean by 'critical financial condition and responsibility'. Please note\nthat regretfully the Madrasah will not be able to bear your travel and Visa\ncosts, etc. However, we will be able to provide you with boarding, lodging\nand meals at a minimal fee of R350.00 per month (approx. U$D50)\n\nAwaiting you reply.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMoulana Haroon Dhooma"
