  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am willing to go for Hajj Insha'Allah this year but my parents are advising me not to perfrom Hajj this year as i am going to get married Insha'Allah a few months after Hajj. However i have plans to take my wife Insha'Allah as soon as possible to Hajj after marriage, they (parents) are advising me to drop now and do Hajj with your wife Insha'Allah next year, i am living in riyadh since last 10 months and i have a permanent job. I want to ask you that as i have money and no credits over me Allhumdulilah i think it will be not good idea for me to drop Hajj this year. Pls advice me to how can i make my parents understand that it is obligatory for me to perform Hajj this year because i think it's quite difficult for me to make my father understand bcoz my father gets angry whenever i don't listen to him.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf you had not yet performed Hajj before, and now you are of the means which makes Hajj obligatory upon you, then you should perform it as soon as possible.\n\nTo the best of your ability, you should try to convince your father, in a very humble and respectable way. Make Du?aa to Allah Ta?ala to make it easy for you to go and that your father may accept and give you his happiness. Work into that direction and always keep in wind, that if your call to the Mubaarak lands is there, definitely Allah Ta?ala will make a means. If you had already performed Hajj before, then the best thing to do is pay respect to your father?s desire and do again in the future.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
