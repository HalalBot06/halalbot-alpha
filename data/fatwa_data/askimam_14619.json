  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAslamu Alaikum\n\nmy question is if a girl has been given the right to divorce at the time of nikah and under very angry state of mind she sends I divorce you sms to her husband but after couple of days she repents and says I take you back but again after sometime under a very angry state she says it to her husband that I divorce you over the phone again after couple of days she repents and says I take you back does this mean they are divorced or they can get back to each other and also can the girl and the guy both keep the right of divorce at the time of nikah?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nIn order for us to issue a ruling, we need to know the exact nature and wordings of the Tafweez-e-Talaq. In general, the husband can hand over the right of Talaq to the wife and she could exercise that right and divorce herself. However it is dangerous for husbands to give an unlimited and unrestricted Tafweez-e-Talaq to ones wife. The contents of this question makes that clear.\n\n \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
