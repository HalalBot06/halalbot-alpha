  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy wife is 7 months pregnant and she would like to know how to perform salaat given that she is unable to do sajda as usual. In this condition how should she do sajda? Should she sit on a chair and do sajda on a table? Or should she do sajda only by sign? Can she do sajda by keeping hands on the floor and just bending a little while sitting?\n\nIf she can not sit down on the floor, can she do qiyam and ruku as usual and sit on chair and do sajda and attahiyat. Request you to kindly elaborate\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf a pregnant woman experiences extreme difficulty in making Qiyaam (standing) and/or Ruku and Sajdah, then she may sit and perform her Fardh Salaat. She may also make Ruku and Sajdah with gestures, in which case her indication in Sajdah must be more lower than in Ruku.
