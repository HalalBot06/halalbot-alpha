  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs artificial insemenation permissible in islam?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAs believers, we should appreciate and accept that granting of children is the sole prerogative of Allah. Allah in His infinite knowledge and wisdom will bless a person with children at a time that is appropriate to that personâ€™s specific situation. At times, Allah may not grant a couple children, whilst this is also a blessing unto them.\n\nAmongst the negative characteristics of artificial insemination are: an unnatural conception, woman is required to expose her private parts, etc. However, inability to conceive is also essentially a medical problem and Islam has encouraged us to adopt medicine and medical treatments as a means. Therefore, if a genuine medical conditions exists, e.g. infertility, then under the guidance of an upright competent doctor, artificial insemination may be adopted as a medical treatment. This is provided that a surrogate mother is not used and only the sperm of the husband should be used.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
