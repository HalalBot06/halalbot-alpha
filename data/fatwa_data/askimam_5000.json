  "question": "in Islam why are women not allowed to pluck their eyebrows? more q's below",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nin Islam why are women not allowed to pluck their eyebrows? I heard the prophet Mohammed had cursed a woman who did so... But can?t you even like do it to please your husband? Let?s say a woman?s totally unattractive and by making her brows a little straighter or skinnier she looks a lot better and different... So what?s say? If a woman (a mother) goes to let?s say... to Britain (where her mother?s family lives) with her little kids, her husband says she can stay for about 3 or 4 months but she due to health situation and other matters she turns out to be staying over time and her husband get all mad ( because he?s like a little annoyed) and starts swearing at his wife?s family especially his mother in law and her sis n bros too... Just because of that is he allowed to? And what if he?s teen daughters say it?s okay they don?t mind and it truly doesn?t bother them if she (the mother) isn?t back within a year or so? Is it permissible to wax, shave or pluck body hairs? Like on the legs and arms? ARE you a Sunni Imam? I know that people choose spouses with mostly three things in mind (in general): beauty, status (reputation), and religion. But how can one find all tree aspects in ONE single person? Wassalam...\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\na) Mullah Ali Qari (R.A) has commentated that plucking of the facial hair is%0D%0Aharaam (prohibited) for a woman with the exception of moustache or beard%0D%0Ahairs, if any woman is unfortunate enough to be troubled by these. (Mirqaat%0D%0AVol.8 Pg.295; Ashrafiyyah). However, if the eyebrows have become so dense%0D%0Athat it is unseemly for a woman and incites abhorrence in her husband, it is%0D%0Apermissible to trim it to a more appropriate and normal size. (Ahsanul%0D%0AFataawa Vol.8 pg.76; Zakariyya Book Depot)%0D%0A%0D%0Ab) A woman that goes against her husbands Jaa'iz (permissible) wishes%0D%0Awithout valid Shar'I reason is a Naashizah (disobedient). If she has a valid%0D%0AShar'I reason, she will not be sinful. Swearing, whatever the reason for%0D%0Adoing so, is deplorable and inexcusable. In fact, a Hadith describes it as a%0D%0Asign of the Munaafiqeen (hypocrites).%0D%0A%0D%0Ac) It is permissible, though unseemly for males. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyyah%0D%0AVol.15 Pg.385)%0D%0A%0D%0Ad) We are Sunnis%0D%0A%0D%0Ae) If one is able to realize all these virtues in one woman, which is rare%0D%0Aindeed, he is extremely fortunate, although this is not the meaning of the%0D%0Ahadith in question. The Hadith, after pointing out the usual qualities%0D%0Asought in a spouse, merely exhorts one to give highest priority to Deen%0D%0A(religion), since it is the most important.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Bilaal Cassim%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Muhammad Kadwa"
