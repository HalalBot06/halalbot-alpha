  "question": "Please advise if it is permissible to perform the 6 rakaats sunnat for Jummah before the Khutbah as time is insufficient as I have to get back to work",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Sunnats after Jummu'ah must be performed after Jummu'ah Salaat. They\ncannot be performed before Jummu'ah Salaat.\n\nThere are two opinions regarding the number of Rakaats of Sunnah after Jummu\n'ah - six (four and two) and four only. Ideally, a person should perform six\nRakaats. If he is under time constraint, he may suffice by performing four\nRakaats only.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
