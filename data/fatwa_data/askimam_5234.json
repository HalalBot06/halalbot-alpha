  "answer": "QUESTION\nI did istikhara or someone, it came out very positive.we wanted to marry for Allahs sake. Then he upset me so I forgot about him, recently he asked me if I would marry him and I said no, was this a right thing to do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala says in the noble Qur'aan, 'And the matter of the believers is\nwith mutual consultation.' Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said,\n'The person who consults does not regret.'\n\nMarriage is a major issue and you should have consulted with your seniors\nbefore having turned down the proposal. It appears that the person upset you\nand your emotions have motivated the decision. If so, it is our opinion that\nyou have not conducted yourself appropriately.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
