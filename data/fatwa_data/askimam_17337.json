  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nmy question is regarding body hair...can man/women remove there hair(hands,legs,chest,back) if your answer is no then please provide me a reason...should we remeove our hair before 40 days...\n\nyour explained answer would be appreciated.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh  \n\n1) It is permissible for both men and women to remove unwanted hair from areas such as the hands, legs, chest, and back. However, it is undesirable for them to do so. It is not permissible to trim the eyebrows and for women to remove hair from the head.\n\nRasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) has cursed women who trim and shape their eyebrows. It is said in a Hadith:\n\nعن علقمة قال لعن عبد الله الواشمات والمتنمصات والمتفلجات للحسن المغيرات خلق الله فقالت أم يعقوب ما هذا ؟ قال عبد الله وما لي لا ألعن من لعن رسول الله وفي كتاب الله ؟ قالت والله لقد قرأت ما بين اللوحين فما وجدته قال والله لئن قرأتيه لقد وجدتيه { وما آتاكم الرسول فخذوه وما نهاكم عنه فانتهوا } \n\n\n\"Abdullah cursed those women who practiced tattooing and those who removed hair from their faces and those who created spaces between their teeth artificially to look beautiful. Such ladies have changed what Allah has created. Um Yaqub said, \"What is that?\" Abdullah said, \"Why should I not curse those who were cursed by Allah's Messenger and are referred to in Allah's Book?\" She said to him \"By Allah, I have read the whole Quran but I have not found such a thing. Abdullah said, \"By Allah, if you had read it (carefully) you would have found it. (Allah says:) 'And what the Prophet gives you, take it and what he forbids you, abstain (from it).'\" – (Sahih Al-Bukhari 7/83 Dar al-Fikr)\n\nوفيه: قطعت شعر رأسها أثمت ولعنت  زاد في البزازية: وإن بإذن الزوج لا طاعة لمخلوق في معصية الخالق\n\n(Darrul-Mukhtaar, 6/407, HM Sa’eed)\n\nوفي حلق شعر الصدر والظهر ترك الأدب كذا في القنية\n\n(Raddul Muhtar, 6/407, HM Sa'eed)\n\n \n\n(Bahishti Zewar, 2/81-82, Zam Zam Publishers)\n\n(Fatawa Mahmudiyya, 19/444, Faruqiyya)\n\n \n\n2) It is necessary to remove pubic hair and hair of the underarms within a period that does not exceed forty days. If one does not do so within forty days, it will constitute as a sin\n\n(Bahishti Zewar, 2/82, Zam Zam Publishers)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMl.
