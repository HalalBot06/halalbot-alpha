  "answer": "QUESTION\nHere in our local community there is a (Muslim) lady who is arranging an interfaith youth camp where\npeople of all religions will be invited to send their children. The age category is not known at this stage\nbut it could be targeted at ages about 10 to maybe 25. Activities will be arranged for the youths where there will be obvious mixing of not only sexes but aslo of the various religions. This event being a Haraam event:\n1. Please give me a Fatwa in this regard.\n2. How can I as an ordinary Muslim here in the community, not a very learned person, not even a Hafez, not even well revered in the community inform the Muslims NOT to allow their kids to attend this uneventful camp? I would like to prevent for instance but amongst other things some Muslim kid being brainwashed by some more elderly kid of another religion because this is what could happen.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are two aspects to this query\n\na) Interfaith programme b) Youth\n\nThe object of an interfaith programme is to afford an opportunity to the various religious groups to offer a presentation about their religion. The object of the presenters in such programmes is to convince the audience about their religion and influence people to accept their faith.\n\nAs Muslims, it is our belief that Islam is the true religion. Allah states \"whoever accepts a faith besides Islam will be rejected\" (surah 3). The proof of Islam being the true religion is known to all. In order for a person to be convinced on any subject, he/she should have an open heart and mind to listen to the facts provided. Any one with a preconceived mind can never be influenced or convinced on a contrary view or opinion. We observe that such programmes rarely yield positive results as most participants already have preconceived minds.\n\nYou state that a woman is arranging an interfaith programme for youth. Youth generally do not concentrate on complex issues such as religion etc. A mixed gathering such as this will become a pure entertainment for them and they will seize the opportunity from being away from their parents sight and become mischievous and involved in Haraam. The object of the programme will never be achieved in this way. If we portray islam to be a religion just like the others, no one will be attracted to islam. The only way to attract people to Deen is with action. Just like Nabi () and Sahabah attracted the non Muslims of that time through actions. Without being practical Muslims debating and proving the supremacy and beauty of Islam, will certainly not convince people to enter the fold of Islam. It is also important that we portray the true and perfect Deen. We should not project a distorted and comprising version of Deen.\n\nTherefore, responsible members of the community should try and convince the lady not to arrange such functions as this has no benefit and will be a means of people falling into haraam and sin.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
