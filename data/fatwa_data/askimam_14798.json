If a person cannot support his wives and he cannot maintain equality, it is not permissible for him to take another wife. If he does take another wife in spite of him not being able to support all his wives and not being able to maintain equality, that will be oppression and a major sin. In the enquired case, Shariah prohibits one having a girlfriend.\n\n1. If you wish to marry her you may do so.\n2. In order for the Nikah to be valid the first wife’s permission is not necessary. However, it is advisable to discuss the issue with the first wife before committing to another marriage.\n3. You are an adult. You do not need your parent’s permission to marry. However, they are your seniors and have your wellbeing at heart. You should discuss your intentions with them.\n4. The in-laws permission is not a requirement in Shariah. It is obvious that as parents they will be affected and you may consider their feelings.\n5. The father-in-law or first wife cannot claim an annulment of the first marriage due to you taking another wife. A separation of any time period does not constitute a divorce or annulment.\n\nOur advice to you is to be cautious. If your intention of seeking another wife is to attain absolute peace, that is not possible. Tolerate this situation or else you may end up being forced to tolerate a worse situation.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala knows best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
