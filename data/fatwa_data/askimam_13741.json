  "question": "If the Imam is Shafi, can a muqtadi who is Hanafi make salatul-witr behind him?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf the Imam is Shafi, can a muqtadi who is Hanafi make salatul-witr behind him?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf the Imaam is a Shaafi’ee and he performs the Witr Salaat by making salaam after 3 Rakaats, i.e. completes the Salaat with one Salaam only after the third Rakaat, then it will be permissible for a Hanafi Muqtadi to follow the Shaafi’ee Imaam.\n\nHowever, if the Shaafi’ee Imaam makes salaam after 2 Rakaats, i.e. then there is a lee way according to some Ulama for a Hanafi Muqtadi to follow the Shaafi’ee Imaam. However, since Salaat is a fundamental ibaadat, as a precaution, it will be best to repeat the Witr performed behind a Shaafi’ee Imaam.
