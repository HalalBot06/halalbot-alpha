  "question": "If questions related to sex are discuss so openly there is a chance of people doing the same,if someone get spoil and start doing the same",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf questions realted to sex are discuss so openly there is a chance of people doing the same,if someone get spoil and start doing the same,he will be a sinner but the person who ask such question will be the main culprit and whoever get spoiled by his question a part of sin goes to him as he is the founder of that question please explain me as i have ask a sex related question in this site and iam worried that people will get spoil by it and i will be held the main culprit for this. I got this Because it is there in Quran that the person who has mudered first will be the main sinner as he has started it,this is related to adam alie salaam son who mudered his brother for a girl and all the muders happening in this world sin will be on his shoulder.If this is true then we should answer these type of questions seperately through mail.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are positive aspects as well as negative aspects to sex related queries.\n\nThe answers to such queries may serve to educate people. The person who poses such a query will be rewarded as he was a means of educating others. It is possible but unlikely that people will abuse such queries as this is an Islamic site for sincere seekers of Deen. People with perverted practices will not use this site for perverted referrals.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
