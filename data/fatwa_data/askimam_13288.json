The word ‘Sadaqah literally means to be truthful. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘As sadaqatu burhaanun’ (To give sadaqah is a testimony of a person’s faith and belief). In English, Sadaqah is generally understood as a voluntary contribution or in other terms as Lillah (for the pleasure of Allah). If this is what you mean by sadaqah, a voluntary contribution, then this may be given to anyone including one’s parents. In fact, there will be more reward in giving sadaqah to one’s parents. The reward will also be more. Sadaqah money may be used to build the parent’s house or even build a Madrasah. The intention of giving sadaqah to anyone may also be on behalf of the deceased and to give them the reward of the sadaqah. However, if by Sadaqah, Zakaat is meant, then the laws of Zakaat will apply. It is not permissible to give Zakat to one’s parents.\n\n2. If a person owed a deceased person money, the amount now belongs to the heirs of the deceased. The heirs should be contacted and given the money.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
