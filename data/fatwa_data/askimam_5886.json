  "question": "Assalamoalaikum mufti sahab! some questions on earnings, songs, history",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. A friend works for a catering company. He serves food in parties. Very recently, he was called upon by the company to work in a party. When he reached the place, he saw that it was a marriage ceremony of Hindus in a temple (mandir). He called his boss and refused to work because of his religious problem. But the owner insisted and said that he has no other staff to work at the moment. However, he had to work in the party inside the temple where several people were worshipping. He was also told there that the floor was washed by cow's sacred urine. Anyhow, my question is that will his earning from this party be halal? he is paid for every party he attends (no monthly salary) 2. As it is known that listening or singing songs is forbidden, I sometime in past, came across a book which states that the wishes (dua) of a person who listen to songs arent accepted. Please verify whether it is true. Kindly provide the reference as well. 3. I have read that before prophecy was given to Hazrat Muhammad sallAlahoalaihiwasallam, he used to go to cave Hira and worship. He practiced this for more or less 7 to 9 years. Kindly inform, what did he do there as no form of worshipping was revealed up till then?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Yes. His earnings will be Halaal.\n\n2. We have not come across any specific reference of such a Hadith.\n\n3. He engaged in the remembrance of Allah and strenghtening his link with\nAllah. A pure and natural soul necessitates belief in Allah Ta`ala and whose\nsoul can be more pure and unadulterated than that of Rasulullah (sallallahu\nalayhi wasallam)! Some scholars say that he engaged in devotions in\naccordance with the pure way of Hadrat Ibrahim (alayhis salam) See Al-Kanz\nal-Mutawari v2 p32\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
