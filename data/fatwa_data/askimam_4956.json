  "question": "If the marriage is dissolved?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nOnce I asked a question about Khula. The question number was 2618, dated 2001-04-07. Thank you for the detailed answer about that. I want to ask a further question in this regard. Now that person (who performed second marriage) wants to come back to first wife (who asked for Khula). The person wants to keep both wives. I want to ask, after all this, can first wife still live with that person as husband and wife or not? Please advise.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf Khula had already taken place, the couple are separated. However, should\nthey wish to reunite, then they may perform a new Nikah, with mutual\nconsent.\n\nThis will be permissible even though the husband may have taken another\nwife.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Muhammad Kadwa"
