  "question": "Is it correct that for isal-e-sawab of parents if children recite kalima 100000 times than the maghfirat of the deceased is inevitable.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nKindly inform if there is any wazifa through which the deceased is given maghfirat.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is no Wazifa or Kalimah that guarantees the Maghfirat of the deceased. It is all left up to the wish and choice of Allah Ta?ala.\n\nThe heirs and family members of the deceased should make as much Tilaawat of the Qur?aan, Sadaqah, Dhikr, Du?aa and Maghrifat for the deceased. Insha Allah, the deceased will be forgiven.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
