  "question": "Mufti Sahib, I cannot concentrate when I'm doing any form of zikr i.e salaat, quran, tasbeeh. e.t.c why is this?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere can be a number of different reasons for this. In brief, one requires\na spiritual guide (Shaykh), with whom one has to correspond regularly. He\nwill advise certain steps, and await your response. Upon hearing how you\nhave progressed, he will advise you further. This is an ongoing process.\n\nOne should search for one qualified in the field of Tasawwuf, and one with\nwhom you have confidence in. In the meanwhile, try to direct your mind to\nsomething that is more tangible and physical. Example: In Salaat concentrate\non the pronunciation of the words and the posture of the limbs.\n\nSimilarly, in Dhikr and Tilaawat, concentrate on the correct pronunciation\nand every now and then actually verbally remind oneself that you are\nengaging in these forms of Ibaadat to gain Allah Ta'ala's love and pleasure.\n\nMay Allah Ta'ala give us all Tawfeeq.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
