  "question": "·What is SAKARAAT? ·Does every single person have to undergo this? Even the one’s that die of a sudden death? ·How can one try to protect them selves from it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSakaraat is the pangs and pain experienced at the onset of death and its\nsigns.\n\nGenerally, every person experiences some pain but the level ad severity\nvaries, some less and some more, according to divine decree. Hadhrat Aaisha\n(Radhiallaahu Anha) said, 'after seeing the pain Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) experienced, she did not think bad or good of difficulty or easy\ndeath.' In this case of sudden death, the level of the pangs are probably\nsudden also or less apparent but not necessarily easier. For an easy death,\nmany Du'aas can be read and strict adherence to the Sunnah and Shari'ah is\nof vital importance.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
