  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalamoalikum, Mufti Sahab, I would like to ask that as a Muslim we have four Imams Abu-Hanifa (Rh The great) Malik (rh) Shafee (rh) and Ahmed Hanbal (rh). So we can follow the teachings of any of the these Imams or we should just choose one? Although you know that they are pure Muslims and this is what all believe. So can we go on the teachings of any of them?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is necessary to follow only one Imaam.
