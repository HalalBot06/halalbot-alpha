  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaikum brother. I have a question on doubt and Shirkh. Firstly I am aware that shirkh and Disbelief are not forgiven (Please correct me if Im wrong). Recently many doubts are creeping into my mind and sometimes I am doubting the existence of Allah and all sorts of other thoughts are coming into my mind (I have seen this du'a 'Laa Howla Wa Laa Qouwwatta Illa Billah' can you translate it to English for me please) sometimes I am searching for answers and think thoughts of Shirkh. So is it that Allah will not forgive me for sometimes thinking that or is it that if I die on this thought I will not be forgiven and If I die without this thought I will be forgiven. I know reverts are forgiven after taking the Shahadah but will I be forgiven after realising the truth again. I can't help thinking that I will not be forgiven and that my soul is doomed for eternity, how can I except this. I am in great need of answers. Also, sometimes thoughts of shirhk like giving others than Allah the attributes of Allah come into my head, when I know that only Allah can hold these attributes, for example I might say someone's name and then say Subahanatuallah but I know that this is wrong and dont mean it. So will I be forgiven. Jazakallahir for your time and effort. Salam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTranslation of 'Laa Hawla Walaa Quwwata illaa billaah' There is no power -%0D%0Ato refrain from evil - nor ability - to do good - except with Allah, the%0D%0AMost High, the Exalted%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah is Most Gracious and Most Merciful. He says in the Noble Qur'aan, 'Oh%0D%0AMy Slaves! Do not despair. Verily Allah will forgive all sins.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIn one Hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have%0D%0Asaid, 'If a person has sins equivalent to the foams of the sea and pebbles%0D%0Aon a desert, Allah's mercy is so encompassing that He will forgive every%0D%0Asin.' In another narration, it is mentioned that Allah will speak secretly%0D%0Ato one of His slaves on the day of Qiyaamat and remind him of all his sins.%0D%0AAfter the person will confess his sins, Allah will say to him, 'I concealed%0D%0Ayour faults in the world, today too, I will conceal your faults. Go in%0D%0AJannah, I have forgiven you.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above mentioned are few of many Ahaadith explaining the extent of%0D%0AAllah's Mercy. However, Allah says, 'Verily Allah will not forgive a person%0D%0Awho ascribe partners (commit Shirk) with Him.' The only sin that is%0D%0Aunforgivable is Kufr (disbelief) and Shirk (ascribing partners). Accepting%0D%0AIslam is the only atonement for the sin of Kufr and Shirk.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf one fulfils the conditions of repentance, i.e. regret and make firm%0D%0Aintention to reform, then surely Allah Ta'ala is Tawwaab (Most Forgiving)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
