  "question": "Who are the \"except some children of his people (Fir'awn)\"... Was the magicians who became muslims one of them?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nYUSUFALI: But none believed in Moses except some children of his people (Firuun?), because of the fear of Pharaoh and his chiefs, lest they should persecute them; and certainly Pharaoh was mighty on the earth and one who transgressed all bounds.\n\nWho are the \"except some children of his people (Fir'awn)\"... Was the magicians who became muslims one of them?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe word Zuriyyath means children as well as a small number.\n\nSo the Ayath could mean that just a few people from Musa's (AS) nation excepted Islam.\n\n \n\nIf we take the meaning of offspring, then there are three opinions.\n\nThe first is that this refers to the children of the people whom Musa (AS) was sent to. The nation of Musa (AS) did not accept his message and died on kufur. Then their progeny accepted the Prophet's message.\n\nThe second opinion is that it refers to a few people from Firawon's family who accepted Islam namely his wife, her servant, Firawon's treasurer his wife, and the person the Quraan refers to as Mumin Al Firawon.\n\n \n\nThe third opinion is that Zuriyyath refers to a group of people whose fathers were from Firawon's nation and whose mothers were from Banee Israeel (nation of Musa (AS)\n\n \n\nAnother opinion is that the word Aamana here does not just refer to having faith. It actually means to openly declare and attest to one's faith. This has to do with the begining of Musa's (AS) invitation of Firawon towards Islam. A group of youngsters (Zuriyyath) openly testified to the kalimath even though they were not being addressed by Musa (AS) . Then later on when Musa (AS) concentrated on his people, the rest of the nation as well accepted Islam.\n\nI did not find any mention of magicians who accepted Islam under the commentary of this ayath.
