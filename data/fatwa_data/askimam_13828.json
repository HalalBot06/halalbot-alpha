  "question": "status of the Qur'an: is it God's uncreated or created speech?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nStudying the history of islam I hit upon the question of the status of the Qur'an: is it God's uncreated or created speech?\n\nI know the Sunni position - uncreated, eternal speech, while the Qur'an as it expressed, written down or recited, is created. I would like to have some information on the Shia position. Is there literature on this, preferably in English?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to the common Shi’ite belief (Ithna-e-Ashari), the Qur’aan we have today is a fabrication. This belief is well documented in classical Shi’ite books. For more information, refer to the following, ‘Khomeini, The Iranian Revolution and Shi’ite Beliefs’ by Manzoor Nu’mani and ‘Shi’ism Exposed’ by Mujlisul Ulama\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
