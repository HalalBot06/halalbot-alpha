  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome Questions: 1) Why Hazrat Ali (Rad.) is referred as Ali Karamalluhu Wajhahu. 2) What does Damat Barkatahum mean? Many Pious elderly people are referred with. 3) What is Qaddasa-Lahu-Sirrah (meaning and purpose); Most Sufi elders are given this title. 4) What?s ?Kashf?? How much necessary is it in our daily life. 5) Can person who is Fasiq claim that he got Rasullah Sallahu Alahi Wa Sallam in his dream. Can we believe this person? This person, who apparently doesn?t follow any Sunnah in his life, yet says that he got Nabi (Sall.) in his dream, who advised him to join Tablighi Taleem in the Masjid but he still chooses to lead Fasiq life\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Karramallaahu wajhahu means, 'May Allah honour his face'. This is\nspecifically mentioned to repel the slogan of the Khawaarij who used to say,\n'May Allah blacken his face' (Na'oodhu billah)\n2. Daamat Barakaatuhum means may his blessings continuously shower upon us.\n3. This means, 'May Allah sanctify his dignity'.\n4. Kashf is divine inspiration which a person receives. Those who are close\nto Allah receive information about certain matters through divine\ninspiration.\n5. It is possible for anybody to see Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) in\ntheir dream. There is no need for us to reject or deny any claim.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
