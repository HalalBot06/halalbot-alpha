  "question": "We, me and my fiance', are planning to get married without our parents consent. Is that permissable?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMe and my fiance' have known eachother for about 5 years even though it's a very long distance relationship. Our families have met, but I guess they don't like eachother very much. My fiance' has finished her school and is working in London and I am almost done with school and am in New York. We are both 25. I have a good job, so I can support her and she plans to work after she moves to chicago to help out anyway. We have talked to our parents and they want us to wait for atleast another 2 years which we really don't want to do. My question is will our nikah be valid even though it will be against our parents will and without their permissoin? And how do I go about doing a nikah? Do the witnesses have to be muslims? What about Wakeel? Does she HAVE to be given away by a guardian? I know it has to be in the musjid. Please advise as soon as possible. She will be comming here at the beginig of August, 2nd to be precise. Thank you very much for the time. Asalam-o-Alaikum\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] states, ?The pleasure of Allah is in the pleasure of parents.?\n\nFrom this Hadith, you should understand that you should try to avoid displeasing your parents and should obey them. By obeying your parents, goodness will be in this world and the hereafter. If your parents have prohibited both of you, in this case you must obey their command. If there is a need and fear committing Zina, then if you are both kufu (compatible) for Nikah, you may get married without your parent?s consent. However, it is better with your parent?s consent.\n\nYour Nikah should be done in the Sunnat way, your witness must be Muslim. Also the Wakeel must be Muslim, you can perform your Nikah any where but in the Musjid is Mustahabb.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
