  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have read on your site the many ways of creating an 'obedient' wife. Where I come from we train our dogs to be obedient not our people. How can your culture, no sorry thats not fair, your SITE justify incouraging readers to treat half their people like animals? You may reply that you treat your women with respect but there is no respect in denying someone basic freedoms. I ask this not as a westerner but as someone who believes in human rights, an ideal that is universal.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is surprising that your allegation of our unfair treatment to woman is based on the use of the word, ?obedient?. Thereafter, you linked up that word to animals according to the use of that word in your culture.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou, thus, conclude that in denying one of basic freedom is against human rights and that you propagate human rights ? an ideal that is universal. To encapasulate your ideology, we simplify your argument in the following formula: Obedient = Animal = Denying of basic freedom. It, thus, follow that your concept of universal ideal of human rights is not to be obedient.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe word obedient simply means to obey. How can you claim to believe in any rights, let aside human rights, if you disagree with the concept of ?obeying?. Which rights is then expected to be obeyed? If you insist on the word ?obedient? being used for animals and you are a strong advocate of human rights, may we conclude that where you come from, regard humans as animals as only such rights can be obeyed. That is then a clear reflection of the western culture and ideology which have reduced humans to the level of animals who merely eat, drink and have no regards to being obedient to anyone.%0D%0A%0D%0APlease note that we did not see the need to offer an academic answer to this question. Thus, we confined our response to a simple logic one.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
