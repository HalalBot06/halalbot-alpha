  "question": "Is Tawaaf more virtuous than salaah in Haram ? Someone who visits grave of Nabi(SAW) guaranteed death with Imaan ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n(1)Hadhrat ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) relates that Nabi (Sallallahu-Alayhi-Wasallam)said: \"Allah sends down one hundred and twenty mercies on the Ka'bah every day and night. Sixty mercies for those performing Tawaaf, forty for those performing Salaat around the Ka'bah and twenty for those looking at the Ka'bah.\" (BAIHAQI). Does this mean that Tawaaf is more virtuous than Salaah within the precinct of the Haram ? (2)Hadhrat ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said: \"Whoever visits my grave, my intercession becomes obligatory for him.\" (DARQUTNI). Does this mean that if a person visits the grave of Nabi(SAW) then he will definitely pass away with Imaan since Nabi(SAW) will probably not intercede for someone who passed away without Imaan ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\na) Yes, according to the Hanafi Madhab, to perform optional tawaaf is more virtuous than offering optional Salaat, especially for those who do not live in the Haram. (Badaaie-sanaa?ie, Manaasik Mullah Ali Qari pg.168; Ghunyatun-Naasik pg.137-138)\n\nb) It is hoped that, Insha Allah, such a person will pass away upon Imaan. Though it is not necessarily definite. This is just like the situation of one who replys to the Adhaan and recites the Du?aa. Thereafter, Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has also mentioned that he will intercede for such a person on the day of Qiyaamat. However, this does not mean that one should become lax with regard to the other matters of Deen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
