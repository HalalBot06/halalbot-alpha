  "question": "Many people have told me that \"one is judged on the society and times in which one lives\". Is this true or not? reference? Length of beard",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have asked for reference so that I can pass on the reply with reference as it is the belief of many brothers i know, but i am unsure about it as they say this to me when talking about the length of ones beard etc. jazaak allah khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is true that in Shari'ah, certain Masaail (rulings) are based on Urf\n(prevailing conditions) but very stringent conditions attached to this\nprinciple prevent general application as is being commonly done today.\n\nOne of the conditions being non-contradiction to any explicit text (Qur'aan\nand Hadith). Shortening of the beard lesser than one fist length will not\nfall under this principle due to direct contradiction of explicit Ahaadith.\nApplication of this principle can only be done by a Mufti or Aalim (scholar)\nwell versed in the principles of Shari'ah and prevailing conditions. The\npeople you have described seem to be abusing this principle to follow their\nown agendas, therefore we advise you to be cautious in dealing with them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
