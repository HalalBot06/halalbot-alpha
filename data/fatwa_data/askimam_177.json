  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBAHAISM%0D%0A%0D%0ABy Zakariyya Ahmed Muhammad Nur%0D%0ATranslated by Hafiz Abdullah Dhabelia%0D%0A%0D%0ABAHAISM PROPAGATES ITS MISLEADING IDEOLOGIES IN AMERICA AND IN ITS%0D%0ANEIGHBOURING REGIONS. WHY DO THE BAHAIS PERSIST UPON THE REJECTION OF THE%0D%0AMIRACLES OF THE AMBIVA (A.S)?%0D%0A%0D%0ADuring my second visit to the USA, at the invitation by the organisation of%0D%0Athe 'Muslim Arab Youth' to propagate the Islamic culture in the city of Los%0D%0AAngeles which has been severely shaken by natural catastrophes, my gaze was%0D%0Adrawn towards a huge building over which hung the banners of every state. I%0D%0Aenquired of my companion, Ramadaan Hasan who is an Egyptian engineer%0D%0Aregarding this building. His reply was, \"This is the Bahai Mosque of Los%0D%0AAngeles, the largest Mosque in the U.S.A. Taken aback, I stood by it,%0D%0Arecalling all their fabrications which they had circulated, their deviations%0D%0Awhich they had strongly adhered to and their book which comprises of a great%0D%0Anumber of lies and differences which had been falsely attributed to divine%0D%0Arevelation whereas divine revelation is totally free from it. This%0D%0Astandpoint had certainly driven me to think of the causes which led to the%0D%0AInternational Zionist Movement, spurring this deviated Bahai'sm and to place%0D%0Aall strength under their control and to link Judaism with it and give it%0D%0Asupport.%0D%0A%0D%0AThrough the passage of time, Persia has become a dangerous ground wherefrom%0D%0Asuch movements emerged, that were hostile to Islam and which made great%0D%0Aefforts in annihilating its teachings some how or the other. Nevertheless%0D%0ABahaism has Jewish roots. However the Jews who are helpless contemporaries%0D%0Ato the Baha Movement, did not suffice upon old Jewish roots, but rather%0D%0Abegan replacing themselves with Jewish tactics by using this movement which%0D%0Aat times were concealed and at times became apparent. Thereafter it made%0D%0Aitself totally apparent, in the present day, when one of the BAHA'I members%0D%0Abecame a Jewish rabbi, as you will see in the unravelling of this topic.%0D%0A%0D%0ABahaism and the unity of religions%0D%0AWhilst touring about in the vicinity of the Mosque in the city of Los%0D%0AAngeles, I observed at its side a massive building known as 'The Union of%0D%0AReligions'. Its chief aim is to combine all the heavenly religions into one%0D%0Asingle religion. This is the very same thing towards which Bahaism is openly%0D%0Acalling. The fact is that the claim that the chain of all heavenly religions%0D%0Ahas only been terminated by the appearance of 'Baha' who unites and%0D%0Acompletes all religions, is totally incorrect, in spite of the fact that he%0D%0Astates in his book that Eesa (A.S) has mentioned (according to them):%0D%0A\"Verily, I have many things to inform you about but you are not capable%0D%0Aenough to bear it right now. However when the spirit of truth appears he%0D%0Awill guide you, as he will not speak of his own accord. He will talk of what%0D%0Ahe bears and he will inform you of matters to occur in the future. He alone%0D%0Awill know what Allah has retained for himself upon the rise of Islam when he%0D%0Asaid, \"And none knoweth it's interpretation except Allah\".%0D%0A%0D%0AThe beliefs of the Bahais and their lives%0D%0AThe Bahai's are using verses of the Holy Quraan and the Ahaadeeth to prove%0D%0Athat the appearance of the new prophet will take place in Akaa, a city of%0D%0ASyria. From amongst the many verses which they use are: \"And listen%0D%0Aattentively to the day when a proclaimer shall call out from a near place,%0D%0Athe day when they will hear the truth. That is the day of emergence.\" The%0D%0Aclosest land to the Arabian peninsula is the plains of Syria. They also%0D%0Abelieve that Nabi (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) had determined the place in a%0D%0AHadeeth which they quote often: \"Glad tidings to that person who has seen%0D%0AAkaa.\" These are such fabrications that do not warrant discussion. However%0D%0Ain Akaa, they lived amongst the Jews where they were highly influenced. This%0D%0Aled to the termination of the link between them and Islam. Bahaism thus%0D%0Abecame a new edition of Judaism and Zionism. Baha proclaimed that all men%0D%0Abelonged to one religion and one homeland. He therefore called towards one%0D%0Areligion which is a combination of all religions and creeds. He opposes%0D%0Adistrict and regional differences and convicts.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe birth of Baha and his upbringing%0D%0AAfter the assassination of 'Al Baabah', Husain Ali Thowry who was born on%0D%0Athe 1st Muharram 1233 A.H. continued with this movement. He was initially%0D%0Afrom amongst the disciples of Albaab - the originator of the Albaabiyah%0D%0Amovement. In spite of Husain having held only one meeting with Albaab, he%0D%0Ainitiated Albaab's call after his death. In the year 1269 A.H. the Shah%0D%0Abanished him with many of the followers of the Albaabiyah movement to%0D%0ABaghdad. The fact of the matter is that he found for himself followers from%0D%0Athe northern regions of Iraq and from Baghdad itself. Within a short period%0D%0Aof time his activities unveiled, after which he was banished to Istanbul.%0D%0AHere he had clashes with his brother regarding who would possess leadership%0D%0Aof this newly reformed movement. He overpowered his brother, hence%0D%0Aestablishing himself in Akaa. Initially he claimed to be the successor of%0D%0AAlbaab, then he claimed he was Albaab himself. Later he claimed to be Imaam%0D%0AMahdi, then he claimed to be a special prophet. Finally he claimed to be a%0D%0Aprophet sent for the whole of mankind. This is the type of prophet, mention%0D%0Aof which has been made in the Baha books. During the latter part of his life%0D%0Ahe claimed divinity based on the beliefs of Halloween and he rejected anyone%0D%0Aclaiming divinity. He gave himself the title 'Bahaullah' (the brilliance of%0D%0AAllah), claiming that the brilliance of Allah had transmigrated in his form.%0D%0ATherefore he would cover his face and walk so that no individual belonging%0D%0Ato the human race could observe the brilliance of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0AHis compilations in the service of his movements%0D%0ABahaullah had compiled a book called Al Kitaabul Aqdas (the holy book) which%0D%0Acomprises of fabricated lies and superstitions. He claimed that this book%0D%0Ahad been revealed by Allah. He states in the book: \"Indeed Allah has%0D%0Arelieved you of that which has been revealed in Al Bayaan (reference made to%0D%0Aa book called Al Bayaanul Arabi compiled by Albaab). And now we have%0D%0Apermitted you to read that which will benefit you.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AHe is presently making an effort to philosophise his activity and to make it%0D%0Aknown internationally. Hence he makes these claims in his books (which we%0D%0Awill soon refer to in this article) and particularly in this book Al Aqdas%0D%0Awherein it is stated that he calls towards religious brotherhood and%0D%0Aespecially between a person who loves his country and a person who loves the%0D%0Aworld. Similarly it is stated that he has prohibited warfare of any kind and%0D%0Athe usage of weapons itself. In the ensuing pages we have briefly mentioned%0D%0Athe teachings of the Bahais.%0D%0A%0D%0ABaha's most important teachings to his followers%0D%0A1. The rejection of the miracles of the Ambiyaa (A.S), resurrection and life%0D%0Aafter death. Similarly the rejection of all promises made by Allah in the%0D%0AQuraan and the denial of Jannat and Jahannum as well.%0D%0A2. According to Baha, salaah consisted of nine rakaats in the morning and%0D%0Aevening. Baha abrogated reading salaah with jama'at and he directed the%0D%0AQibla to Akaa where Albaab's body and Baha's grave is found.%0D%0A3. Baha stipulated that Hajj is for men only and not for women and he made%0D%0Athe mixing of men and women permissible.%0D%0A4. Bahaa had regulated the laws of inheritance between men and women%0D%0Aequally. Similarly he introduced many innovations and fabrications.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe strength of the Bahai Movement%0D%0AThe gatherings and assemblies of the Bahais are eye-catching due to their%0D%0Avastness and beautiful buildings. It was the very fact that caught my eye in%0D%0ALos Angeles. These gatherings are established by issuing booklets and%0D%0Amagazines which unfolds its movements between the Muslims and Christians in%0D%0AAmerica and which calls on international unity, just as they distribute%0D%0Aleaflets (which are extremely dangerous) and which portrays their link with%0D%0Athe National Zionist Movement. We will not be exaggerating if we say that%0D%0Atheir most famous propagators are from the Secrefire Zionist Jews who are in%0D%0Athe garb of the Bahais. The surprising fact is that many renowned%0D%0Apersonalities in the Arab world are sympathetic towards the Bahais, just as%0D%0Athey are sympathetic towards the Freemasons and Rotaries and they are misled%0D%0Aby their animosity towards religions, regions, in fact towards the entire%0D%0Amankind.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Bahais in Los Angeles%0D%0AI have found that amongst the causes of the spreading of the Bahais in Los%0D%0AAngeles which has a Muslim population of 700 00 from different regions and%0D%0Anationalities is idolness and vacuity of the youth. The lives of the youth%0D%0Aare void of effective Islamic propagation. Propagation is of such a level%0D%0Awhich is not satisfying the fervour of the youth, nor is it bringing life to%0D%0Atheir thoughts. Hence the Bahais have filled this vacuum and started a%0D%0Abranch in the heart of the city and have set up quarters for propagation.%0D%0AThey began with the propagation of the book Al I'qaan, which is from amongst%0D%0Athe three books written by Bahaullah. This book has been translated into%0D%0AArabic in an exclusive and fine print as we have been informed by our%0D%0Acompanions. The emergence of the Bahais is not only restricted to the city%0D%0Aof Los Angeles. In fact it is spreading in most of the regions of north and%0D%0ALatin America and some other regions. \"The Bahais have established%0D%0Athemselves in this city and it's dangers have been realised too late\", says%0D%0Athe rector of the Islamic centre of the northern part of the city - Musjidul%0D%0AHuda. Many Americans follow the Bahai Movement and openly announce their%0D%0Aevasion from their original beliefs.%0D%0A%0D%0AHave we realised what a danger this is to the propagation of the true Islam%0D%0Awhich is protecting our Muslim youth (Arab and non-Arab). These deviated%0D%0Agroups and false propagators have placed a barrier on the path of the spread%0D%0Aof Islam.%0D%0A%0D%0A(Translated from the Arabic newspaper \"Al Aalamul Islam\" - 18 Muharram 1415)%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A"
