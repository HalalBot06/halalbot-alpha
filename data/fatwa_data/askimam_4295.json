And also Allah mentions in the quran the torahs many times, was it meant for people of jewish race (but aren?t jew?s as a religion), what exactly is the torahs, and who did Allah guide to write the torah, and what time period was it written in? what race was prophet Isa (p.b.u.h)? And if his name is Isa then were did the name jesus come from?A Christian told me it means ?god saved? what does it really mean?What did his followers and countrymen call him?Also his blessed mother Maryum to Mary and prophet Ibrahim to Abriham ,and Dawud to David,Yahya to John the Baptist etc. along with other prophets changed names, How and why are mostly all prophets of Allah have changed names? Ive heard some pretty disgusting things about prophet Mohammad ( I don?t believe them one bit)p.b.u.h and I get upset, on how people will say that he married a 9 year old and had sex with boys and little children (astakfirulah) What happened during the time of the prophet that would make them think like that? What would they be misinterperating?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Injeel-compilation of the revelation gives to Easa (AS).\nTowrah-compilation of the revelation given to Musa (AS). Easa and Musa are\nthe Arabic of Jesus and Moses, which is in Hebrew. Similarly, Ebrahim is\nthe equivalent of Abraham, Dawood to David and Yahya to John. Hence the\nprophets did not change their names.\n\n2. Somewhere on this site, search, 'Polygamous marriages of Rasulullah'\n(without quotes)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
