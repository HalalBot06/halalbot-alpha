  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissible for Females to wear Permenant or Non Permenant` Artificial Nails?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nWe could not locate any explicit ruling regarding the use of artificial nails. However, we understand that artificial nails are not a replacement, but an extension for natural nails, and are widely used in the fashion trend. The use of artificial nails is a branch of manicure (cosmetic beauty treatment of nails) and has no other benefit. These nails are widely used by non-Muslim women, especially those involved in immoral actions, and are symbolic in their fashion.\n\nSevere warnings have been mentioned in the Ahadith of Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) regarding those who adopt practices symbolizing non-Muslims and those whose actions are immoral and unethical.\n\nوعن ابن عمر قال : قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم : \" من تشبه بقوم فهو منهم \" . (رواه أبو داود)\n\nIt has been narrated on the authority of Ibn ‘Umar (Radhiyallahu Anhu) that Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) said, “Whosoever imitates a tribe or nation, will be regarded from amongst that tribe or nation. (Abu Dawood) \n\nFurthermore, the wearing of artificial nails involves the use of acrylics, UV gel or glue. Nail polish is also applied after wearing artificial nails in most cases. These are insoluble substances and prevent water from reaching the nails.\n\nUV gel has a permanent effect and cannot be removed even by using solvents. Hence, it will not be possible to fulfill the obligations of wudhu, which in turn will result in the invalidation of Salah. Neglecting Salah is considered a grave sin in Islam.\n\nAlthough the effect of acrylics, nail polish and glue are not permanent, they too can only be removed through the use of solvents; and some of them take as long as twenty minutes to half an hour to be removed. Thus, it will not be practical to remove them every time one needs to make wudhu for Salah.\n\nTherefore, it will be undesirable for Muslim women to wear these artificial nails in normal circumstances, and impermissible (haram) to wear them when they result in the negligence of Salah.\n\nMoreover, the contemporary Jurists of Islam have prohibited Muslim women from wearing nail polish based on the above mentioned reasons.\n\n(Aapke Masail aur Unka Hal Vol.7 Pg.137 – Maktabah Ludhyanwi)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
