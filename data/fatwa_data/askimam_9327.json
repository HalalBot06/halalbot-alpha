  "answer": "QUESTION\nA tablighi brother told that one of the conditions of Jihad to be a sharai Jihad is that there should be a Caliph among the Muslims. However I found this to be unacceptable as from what I know, when there is Jihad, Muslims should go forth and choose an Amir among themselves if there is not one. But this is wrongly interpreted as a condition. Please clarify and correct if this understanding of mine is flawed. JazakAllahumul khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf has not been mentioned as a Shar?ee condition for Jihaad to be Fardh that there be a Khalifah amongst the Muslims. (Aalamgiri vol.2 pg.188; Shaami vol.2 pg.128)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
