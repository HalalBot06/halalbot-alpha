  "question": "The person in masjid said “its allowed to eat normal meat except pork in western countries scince its not a muslim country” is it true???",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-wa-alykum 1.)Since I'm here in a Western country, i wont to eat any kind of meat outside since i dont trust anybody but my parents, so i just eat meat at home only. I also suggested my friend not to eat any kind of meat outside till you are really sure that it is halal. But she told me that she had asked about this to someone in masjid and the person answered, its allowd to eat normal meat except pork in western countries scince its not a muslim country. Is it true? 2.) Allah-tala has told not to have any contact with a person who sells Alcohol. And my parents say not to trust a muslim, who sells Alcohol in his resturant. Are we allowed to buy something to eat from his resturant if he says that he sells the Halal meat? 3.) I also told my friend not to have any contact with persons/muslims who drink or sell Alcohol, we are also not allowed to visit them when they are sick or even to go in their namaaz-e-Janaza, but she says \" Prophet Muhammad (sal) had always gone to visit his neighbours and non-muslims, whenever somebody was sick/ill, although at that time there were many people who were alcoholic. If its really true not to have contact then why do we buy food at grocer's shop here like Aldi or Lidl? they also sell alcohol, If Muhammed (sal) used to visit his non-muslim neighbours then why shudnt we visit our muslim people?\". Can u please clear us the situation here, who is right and who is wrong?Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. A Muslim can eat only that meat which is slaughtered according to the Shari?ah. That is, the slaughterer must be a Muslim, he recites the name of Allah before slaughtering and he severs all four veins or most of them. It is not permissible to eat just any meat. The meat of any animal which is slaughtered according to Shari?ah rites of Zabah is prohibited like pork.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Alcohol and all intoxicants are prohibited. It is not permissible for a Muslim to sell intoxicants. The income from the sale of intoxicants is also Haraam. The Muslim involved in the sale of intoxicants is guilty of committing a major sin, and he is regarded as a Faasiq (transgressor). Such a person?s word regarding Halaal and Haraam is not accepted.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. There are two issues regarding our association to people engaged in sin; a) Violation of Shari?ah, and b) Good character. A Muslim must be sensitive to Deen. His prime responsibility is to obey Allah. Any disobedience to Allah and His Rasul [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] cannot be tolerated. That is why Nahy anil munkar (condemning the wrong) is an integral part of Deen. The Bani Israaeel were cursed as people used to engage in wrong and their leaders did stop condemning the wrong. However, good character is also an integral part in the life of a Muslim. While he has to condemn the wrong, he cannot lose sight of good character. If a person is inneed, or ill, etc. he should fulfil the need of the person and also visit the sick. It is this good character that encourages good relationship and helps stopping wrong and evil.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
