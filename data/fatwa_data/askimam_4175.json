  "question": "Whose \"istikhara\" Should i Follow?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaam U Alaikum My problem is that I did the 'istikhaaraa' for appearing privately in exams twice, it came positive both times. My brother did the 'istikharaa' for it again but it came negative, whose istikharaa should I follow? I know my situation better than my brother does. So I think my 'istikhaara' was right, and I should follow that instead of my brother's. What should I do? Please advice. Jazakallahu Khairun\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, a person should perform Istikhara personally and follow the\nguidance of the Istikhara. If you had requested your brother to also perform\nistikhara, and since there is a negative indication in it, we advise you\nexcerise precaution and perform istikhara again.\n\nHowever, if you are sure of your istikhara and do not have any reservations,\nthen you may follow the guidance of your istikhara.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT"
