  "question": "Salamu alaikum, please intrepret these dreams for me dear Mufti.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nFirstly, I had a dream where my little sister age 10 said to me, \"Here is my friend, Gabriel.\" Then I looked to her side and all of a sudden a tall, greenish-skinned person looked at me in a very angry and frightening way. I was so scarred that then I immediately, in the dream fell into Sajdah, not to the thing, but towards the Qibla, and said something praising Allah. What does this mean?? Also, I had another dream, whereby I was in Masjid-ul-Haraam. Yet it was strange - on one side of the Ka'bah was a pub, Astagfirullah, and I saw inside all sorts of Fitnah, and a person I knew asked, \"What's the problem with all of this?\" And I replied in anger, \"I wish I could destroy it all.\" Then I left the pub, I wanted to do Tawwaf, and saw a group of girls sitting near the Ka'bah, yet with non-Muslim clothing. I asked them to verify that one must circulate 7 times, but they said, \"No, no, you don't have to do that!\" and commenced their laughter, as if they were Munafiqs. Then i went to look for the Wudu area, but I couldn't find the large entrance - instead a small corridor, with a room full of Jews planning a scheme. I left in anger. Also, I went past a large Saudi gathering in front of the Ka'bah, where there were lots of fancy lighting. What does all this mean? Jazakallah dear Mufti.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe first dream expresses the need for a fully Islamic environment and\nupbringing for your family. The effect of its negligence was shown to you in\nthe dream.\n\nThe second is a true reaction of the reality of affairs taking place in the\nworld today. There is also an indication that you should increase your\nefforts for Deen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nShaykhul Hadith Moulana Haroon Abbaassommar"
