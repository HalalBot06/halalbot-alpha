  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it necessary for a woman to go to live at her family's home for a short period after her iddat for the death of her husband?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAccording to Shariah, it is necessary for the wife of the deceased husband to spend the Iddah at her husbands home after his demise. It is not permissible for her to leave the husband's home without a valid reason. Therefore, she will not be permitted to go to her family's home during the Iddah if there is no valid Shar'ie reason to do so.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
