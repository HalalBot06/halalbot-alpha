  "question": "When on holiday (say 5 days), is any Salaat compulsorily. And please explain on Salaat when travelling (over 80 km).",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAll five Salaats (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib and Esha) are Fardh (compulsory) at all times, whether one is on holiday or not. There is no exemption from Salaat when one is on holiday. The only time one is exempt for Salaat is when one is unconscious. In that situation too, if one is unconscious for 5 Salaats, one will have to make Qadhaa (make up) for the missed Salaats.\n\nIf a person is unconscious for six Salaats and more, then only he will be completely exempt from those Salaats missed in that state of unconsciousness.It is clear from the aforegoing, the importance of Salaat. If a person is ill, he must still perform Salaat.\n\nIf one cannot perform Salaat in the standing posture, then he must sit and perform Salat. If that is not possible, then lie down and perform Salaat. When one is in war, then too Salaat is Fardh and cannot be omitted. The Quran is replete with the order of Salaat, almost 700 times. The parting advice of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was to hold firm on Salaat. The first act of worship a person will be held accountable for on the day of Qiyaamat will be Salaat. It is clear from the aforegoing, that being on holiday is not a reason to be on holiday for Salaat. The obligation of Salaat still remains. However, if one is on a journey of 88 kms or more, then there is concession from four Rakaats to two Rakaats in Dhuhr, Asr and Esha Salaats.\n\nThe Sunnats before and after the Fardh Salaat are also exempt in such a journey. However, if a person undertakes a journey of 88 kms or more and intends staying at one place for fifteen days or more, then too he will have to perform complete Salaat.\n\nÂ \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
