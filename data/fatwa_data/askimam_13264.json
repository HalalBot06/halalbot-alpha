  "answer": "QUESTION\n\niv been having a debate with a christian and he asked me to explain the contridictions in the Quran,i know the Quran is the infalliable word of Allah swt.\n\nhis comment was that in surah fussilat(41:9-12)the earth is created in two deays then 4 then two,i said to him his misunderstanding the ayat but he claimed that the earth was created in 6 days then why does it say 2 in the ayat?please could you explain this to me?jazkallah khaire\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe Aayaats quoted by the Christians are as follows:\n\n‘Say! Do you deny that Being (Allah) Who created the earth in two days and do you join equals unto Him? He is the Lord of the Worlds. And He placed on the earth mountains from above it and bestowed blessings on the earth and apportioned all things to give them nourishment in one’s proportion in four days in accordance with the needs of those who seek sustenance… Thus He completed the seven heavens in two days and he assigned to each heaven its duty and command…’\n\nIn the above Ayaats, it appears as though the heavens and earth were created in eight days. This apparently contradicts other Aayaats of the Qur’aan in which Allah mentions that the heavens and earth were created in six days. The heavens and earth being created in six days is substantiated from the following Aayat:\n\n‘Verily, your Lord is Allah who created the heavens and the earth in six days.’ (A’araaf Aaya55)\n\n‘It is Allah who has created the heavens and the earth and everything between them in six days.’ (Sajdah Aayat4)\n\nThe Mufassireen have reconciled between the Aayats of Surah Fussilat (which imply that the heavens and earth were created in eight days). The four days mentioned in verse10 include the two days in verse9. Thus, the two days in verse9 refer to Sunday and Monday and the four days in verse10 refer to Tuesday and Wednesday (including Sunday and Monday). In verse12, Allah mentions that He complete the heavens in 2 days. These 2 days were Thursday and Friday taking the count to six days. (Tafseer ibn Kathir vol.4 pg.83; Darul Mufeed – Tafsir Jalaalayn pg.397)\n\nOne cannot interpret the Qur’aan as he wishes. There are rules and principles that govern the proper interpretation of the Qur’aan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
