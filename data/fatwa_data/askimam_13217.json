  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI had the dream after fajr salaat.\n\nMy family and I were visiting someplace in the middle east could not tell which country it was, there was another family with us on vacation, friends of ours but I could not tell who they were. We were getting ready to leave for the airport and I saw this man who looked like a Mongolian and a bull drop from the sky, both he and the bull were very LARGE/HUGE, they both started to terrorize the people but for some reason they left us alone. My family and this other family excluding me were swimming in this pool, which was crystal clear beautiful blue/green water, which was very cool. At this point in time I got a taxi and I was trying to get my family out of the water so that we could get to the airport, I phoned an ImamÂ to tell him what has happened and I can see sitting in the Musjid and he starts to laugh at what I am telling him and he is saying don't worry, and he is laughing loud and hard.\n\nI managed to get my family and this other family into the taxi and as we are about to leave this bull which is huge about the size of a house comes running towards the taxi with us in the taxi, and if it hits the taxi we will all be killed or severely hurt, but them at the very last second it goes around the taxi and leaves us alone and continues to terrorize the rest of the people, and then I wake up.\n\nCan you please tell me what does this dream mean, it has been heavy on my mind.\n\nSalaam\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe dream refers to the different forms of Fitan (tests, evil) that will dawn upon your locality or country from which you and your family will be saved. Continue performing your Salaah with Jamaat in the Musjid and encourage your family to perform their Salaah on time at home. Recite the Quraan and make Zikr daily. Inshallah through these actions Allah will protect you and your family from all calamities.\n\nAllah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
