  "question": "Whats the purpose of an imam giving the person becoming muslim shahada in the masjid in front of the congregation?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalamu alakum wa Rahmatulahi wa barakatuhu, My question relates to one declaring Islam. According to my understanding, all one needs to become muslim is by reciting shahada with the tongue and one does not need a person or imam to give him shahada, one does not need witnesses, nor does one need to be in a mosque. My question is this: what is the purpose in an imam giving the person becoming muslim shahada in the mosque in front of the congregation? It is a great joy to see one declare his/her Islam, but I just want to know the exact purpose of one declaring Islam in this fashion. Jazakulah kharain?..May Allah Bless you for your help?..Asalamu alakum\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour understanding is correct. It is not necessary for the Imaam to give Shahaadah to a revert to Islam. If a person believes in the basic tenets of Islam, and proclaims that by himself, that is sufficient. He will be a Muslim.\n\nIt is obvious that a new revert to Islam feels strange and he needs to be made comfortable. It is important that his proclamation be witnessed by his congregation so that they may enjoin with him brotherhood in Islam immediately and assist him.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
