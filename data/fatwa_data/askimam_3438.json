  "question": "When can a person combine 2 salaats. I was at a course with people from Saudi Arabia & performed both their Zuhr and Asr salaat during the lunch break.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs this possible and under what conditions? Once an Aalim who was Musaafir read his Maghrib salaat and 5 minutes later before starting on his journey performed his Esha salaat. Is this possible and under what conditions? I have a problem sometimes when on course , although I'm not musaafir. Making wudhu is a problem so i hold my wudhu from Zuhr to Asr , which is difficult , to perform my Asr salaat. If I could perform them both at lunch time it will be convenient. Is this possible ? I work for a kuffar organisation and we finish late at times. In winter when time for Sunset is very early , if the asr salaat can be performed during Lunch time , then the risk of missing the Asr time won't be there. Is this possible ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Jurists (Fuqahaa) have differences of opinion granting concession to a\nMusaafir combining two Fardh Salaats in one Fardh Salaat time, for example,\nto perform Dhuhr at Asr time or Asr at Dhuhr time. Similarly, to perform\nMaghrib at Esha time or Esha at Maghrib time. That is permissible according\nto the majority of the Fuqahaa.\n\nAccording to Imaam Abu Hanifa, a Musaafir must perform every Salaat\ntimeously and combining the two Fardh Salaats at one Salaat time is not\npermissible. However, apparent combining is permissible. That is, for\nexample, to perform Dhuhr Salaat just before Dhuhr time terminates and soon\nthereafter perform Asr Salaat as soon as Asr time commences.\n\nThe abovementioned concession is for a Musaafir only, not a Muqeem (non\ntraveller).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
