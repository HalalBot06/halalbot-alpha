  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. FirstlyÂ  i would like to ask on behalf of a friend, they are in need of a dua in order to help them in times of distress, due to family problems between mother and father and the members of the family. any duas(supplications) would be greatly appreciated.\n\n2. Regarding, tasweer, i know this has been asked many a times before and i feel awkward asking again, but somone told me that Mufti Taqi Uthmaani made a fatwa that Digital Tasweer was allowed e.g. Videos etc. i ask whether this is true?\n\nJazakallahu Khairan\n\nPlease make dua for us all,\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAt the outset it is important the parents understand that their differences and quarrels have an effect on the children. It is natural to have differences but that should be within limits. If they have difficulty in resolving their differences, they should consult some senior to intervene and assist in the problem. Continuous stress and antagonism creates instability in the mind of the children, thus not making the children confident and progressive. Although Duas are effective but the issue will not be addressed with duas. Practical mechanisms will have to be implored to repair the situation.\n\nWe are aware of the fatwa issued by Hadrath Mufti Taqi Usmani Saheb. We are of the opinion that digital photo is also tasweer, thus haraam.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammed Zakariyya Desai\nStudent: Darul Ifta\n\nChecked and Approved: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
