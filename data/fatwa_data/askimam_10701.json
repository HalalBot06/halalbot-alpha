  "question": "My question regards the husband having intercourse with his wife during bath. Is this allowed?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)I have read a hadeeth from Bukhari (book1) in which it is stated that the Prophet Mohammed (saw) used to take baths with his wife Aisha. My question regards the husband having intercourse with his wife during bath. Is this allowed? 2)in a dream I saw my friends parents from a far and I greeted them with my hand smiling very innerly. Then suddenly the parents are standing to my right and an old woman is standing in front of me. She says to the parents ?he (pointing at me) is a jannati? I respond by saying no to the woman and she repeats what she said earlier. I once again say no and so forth. Then I hug her and begin to cry very heavily. I can see the upper part of her chest (not the breasts) and it has a strange brown colour. Please interpret. Jazakallah kheiran.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is mentioned in the Hadith that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] took a bath together with Aaisha [radhiallaahu anha] and shared the water from one tub. However, the Hadith is not about having intercourse during bath.\n\n2. May Allah Ta?ala make us all Jannatis, Aameen. However, we should be obedient to Allah and carry out His ordains according to the way of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam].\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
