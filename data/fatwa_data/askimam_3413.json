  "question": "About Masjid Aqsa in Jerusalem",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIt is said that when Hazrat Umar (RA) entered Jerusalem he found a rubbish heap on the site of Masjid Aqsa. However when the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam returned from his journey of Isra and Miraj he described the doors and windows of the Masjid. Please could you explain this as when Christians pose this question we do not know how to respond to their assertion that there was no mosque standing when the Prophet went on his Isra journey to Jerusalem.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is clear that Masjid-e-Aqsa was built by Allah's Prophet Sulaimaan (Alayhis salaam), Solomon according to the Christians. If the Christians claim anything against that, it is upon them to explain.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
