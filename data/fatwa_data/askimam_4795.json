  "question": "Can women when praying any Salaah in their homes, recite the Qiraat out loud? Also to teach kids, can we pray the complete Salaat out loud, include all the tasbeehs in Rukoo, and Sajood?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n(ofcourse no strange men present when reading out loud)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen a woman performs her Fardh or Sunnats Salaat individually at home, she\ncannot make Jahri (audible) Qiraat. She may conduct a separate exercise of\nSalaat in order to teach her children the procedure of Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
