  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy problem is , I use to have a lot of thoughts in my mind related to kufr such as If i speak I would be disgraced. Then later I came to know that merely thoughts have no meaning until you act on it or speak it. Now what is happening is whenever I start speaking I feel that I have uttered the same wrong words , I am really feared , I am unable to decide whether I have done it or not. Sometimes I feel that I have really spoken , Also during namaz I feel that during reciting I have spoken the same words. I don't know what to do, These thoughts have taken a permanent place in my brain , I don't know what to do. Some peoples advised me to ignore these as these are doubts. My question is 1. what If i ignore , thinking these as doubts and they may have actually been spoken by me. 2. Is this a SIN which in light of Quran & Hadith will not be forgiven and a person would be termed kaafir?. If he is married he has to renew his marriage. 3. What is the condition that a person spoke. What happens My lips moves and I think I have uttered those wrong words. How to be sure.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If you think you may have uttered words of Kufr and you are unsure whether you uttered them or not, recite Istighfaar and repent. Also recite Ta?awudh (a?oodhu billaah) whenever confronted by evil thoughts.\n\n2. Even if you uttered such evil words and repent thereafter, you are not termed a Kaafir because you repented.\n\n3. There is no need to renew the Nikah because you are unsure of yourself. Yes, if you are definite that you uttered words of Kufr, your Nikah will also have to be renewed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
