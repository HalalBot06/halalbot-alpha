  "question": "I have a black magic on me",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was told that someone put black magic on me and I went to my local mosque where I was given the name of an Imam in another mosque who could help me. I went to the mosque and spoke to that Imam and he told me to give him my name and my age and some money and then after a couple of days he told me that I did in fact have black magic on me and he gave me a treatment for it. This treatment consisted of doing different things like putting various objects in various parts of my house. My question is: do you think that this is acceptable or do you think that it is haram to do the things suggested by this imam. Will I punished for trying the treatment suggested by him? Please answer my question as soon as you can because I don't know what to do. JazaakAllah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are people who are experts in curing one affected with black magic.\nThey are commonly known as Aamils.\n\nIt is permissible to refer to such people to cure oneself from black magic.\nThe Aamil should be a strict adherent of Shari'ah and Sunnah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
