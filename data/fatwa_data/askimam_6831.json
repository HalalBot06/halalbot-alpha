  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs Islamic government from any of the present-day governments or are they all wrong? I mean is it supposed to be present-day democracy, parliamentary, communist, dictatorship, etc? Also how is the economy supposed to be e.g. capitalist, socialist, communist etc, etc? Please explain because I am taking a government class in school and we are studying different types of governments and economies.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, according to Shari?ah there are 3 ways of electing a ruler:\n\nBay?at: Taking allegiance to a particular person, like the companions took allegiance to Abu Bakr (Radhiallaahu Anhu).\n\nDeputism: A current ruler consults his council and stipulates a ruler after his demise.\n\nConsultation: Ruler appoints certain responsible citizens and hands over the autonomy of appointing a ruler after his demise.
