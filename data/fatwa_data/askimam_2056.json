  "question": "Wearing pants below the ankles",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Imam, Assalam-u-alaikum, Two things which annoy me. You probably know the islamicity in cyberspace at http://www.islam.org. Their Imam being of Ahl Sunnah ul Jammah says that he has heard of no Hadith regarding that the garment should not hang below the ankles(Jeddah News). This is quite sad as there are varies Ahadis which certify this prohibition. So please if you could convince that society somehow Jazakullahkhair. The other matter is about shias. I They say that imams opinion differs in this aspect. Some say they are disbelievers while otheres donot say theyÂ´re disb. but consider them only to be highly transgressors. This is definitely a much too light term to be used for the shia. I personally call them Mushrik or Kafirs. Even if all they did was wrong I would not have called them kafirs but the fact that they raise Hazrat Ali and the other Imams so high as to say that they should have knowledge of heavens and earth (which ONLY ALLAH(Rafur-ur-Rahim) has)then they are more than kafir. A kafir has indeed disbelieved but a Shia inspite of having recited Kalima commits Shirk which is never forgivable after one has accepted Islam. So please clarify this to that Islamic society. Jazakullahkhair!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is prohibited to wear pants below the ankle at all times. Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Allah will not look at a person with\nmercy who lowers his pants below his ankle.' (Bukhari)\n\nTo perform Salaat with the pants below the ankles is Makrooh. Therefore, the\npants should be folded above the ankles at all times, in particular, during\nSalaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
