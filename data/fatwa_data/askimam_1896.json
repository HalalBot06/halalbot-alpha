She was about 82. she was blind and she couldn't walk also. she was seating at one place since about 15 yeares. she was not praying namaz, because she was not able to purify her self properly. Please can you comment by hadith and quran as she expired in toilet, which is not pure, what will happen to her hereafter. jazakallah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah Sallallahu Aalaayhi wa Sallam said : Do not speak ill about the\ndeceased (Bukhari).In view of the above mentioned Hadith, it is not\nappropriate for us to comment on the condition of your grandmothers death.\nThe reality of her condition is best known by Allah Ta'ala.\n\nIt is your duty to make dua for her salvation in the Qabr (grave) and the\nhereafter.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
