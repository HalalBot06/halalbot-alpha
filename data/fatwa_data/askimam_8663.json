  "question": "Is it permissable for a Muslim business to sell Haraam meat packed in cans? What about revealing clothes and DVD players?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In principle, anything that contains Haraam (impure) ingredients cannot be consumed or given to anyone. That includes non-Muslims and animals.\n\n2. Any item that has dual or multiple purposes may be sold. In view of the above principle, revealing clothes has dual purpose. It may be bought by women who wish to beautify themselves for their husband, hence, permissible to sell. However, DVD is generally for movies and games, hence, not permissible to sell.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
