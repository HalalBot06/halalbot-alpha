  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalam u Alaikum I have been engaged an year ago and my marriage is fixed after 8 months inshallah. My fiancee has agreed to let me complete me studies after the marriage which shall continue for 4 years inshallah. Also, he has assured me that i shall be his only wife and he wont get another one. But there were times when he broke my trust and so my question is: Is stipulations in the marriage contract allowed regarding the two conditions about polygyny and studies ? If so, what is the procedure? We had a talk over this and he is not ready to believe about the stipulations until he is provided with the authenticated proof from the QURAN and SUNNAH. Unfortunately, i found out that the opinion differs among scholars in this matter. I really need the EVIDENCE as a prove of my words and to move forward with the stipulations part. I really need to make these stipulations to keep my studies going and more importantly,i dont want him to marry a second wife other than me. Please provide your necessary help in this matter.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:"
