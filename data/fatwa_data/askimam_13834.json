  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nJazakoumoullahu khairan for answering my question about my menses (where I had 7 days of red discharge and 21 days of yellow discharge)…u helped me out a lot…may Allah reward u….\n\nI just had a follow up question about this matter….\n\nAround a year ago, I only used to have 7 days of red discharge and I never had any yellow discharge….it is only recently that I started having yellow discharge…..so does this mean that since my menses used to be regular and then they became irregular, so now I have to consider my 21 days of yellow discharge istihaadah and only the first 7 days of red discharge as haid?\n\nFrom bahishti zewar:\n\nA woman used to bleed for three or four days every month. Thereafter, in a particular month she bled for more than her normal period but not more than ten days. All the days that she bled will be haid. But if she bled for more than ten days, then all the days which are more than her normal period will be regarded as istihaada. For example, a woman always had a habit of bleeding for three days. However, in a particular month she bled for nine days or ten days and ten nights. All these days will be regarded as haid. But if she bled for even a moment more than ten days and ten nights, then her first three days are haid and the balance of the days will be regarded as istihaada. It will be wajib for her to make qada of her salaat for the balance of these days.\n\nPlease explain to me if this applies to my situation since my menses used to be for less than 10 days (regular) and now became more than 10 days….\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nKindly take note of our previous answer to you.\n\nWe have reviewed the matter and concluded that your Haydh will be only 7 days. The remaining days will be Istihaadha.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
