  "answer": "QUESTION\nWould it be allowed to substitute \"gelatin\" and \"glycerin\" coated gelcapsules of fish oil for the fish oil itself? I have been advised by my doctor to consume approx., three teaspoonful of fish oil daily to increase my HDL, as it is extreemly low. The problem is, almost ALL of the gelcapsules contain the above listed ingredients which are drevied most likely from animal source. Second, consuming the fish oil in liquid form causes burps every 5-10 minutes, as well as the taste of raw fish. Please advice. Jaza-Allah-O-Khairan, Wa-As-Salaam-O-Alaykum Wa-Rahmaahtullahey-Wa-Baraakatah. Regards, Syed Abdul-Wajid\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible, in fact, advisable to take fish oil and abstain from gelatine and other Haraam capsules.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
