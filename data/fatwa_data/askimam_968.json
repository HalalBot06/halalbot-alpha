  "question": "I want to ask about black magic and nazar. If someone is under a spell of black magic or bad nazar then what should he do.And how can we find out who did this?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam o Alaikum I have a slight problem. I am engaged and everything was going fine till last month. But now my inlaws have changed completely. I am really worried now. Because its a matter of my life. Someone told me the change in their behavior could be because of black magic or nazar. Please tell me how I can confirm this.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBlack magic (Sihr) is a reality and is mentioned in the Noble Qur'aan. Nazar%0D%0Ais also a reality and is mentioned in the Hadith. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) was affected with the worst form of black magic. He%0D%0Aresorted to Du'aa and finally was informed by Allah about the Jew, 'Labid%0D%0Aibn Asam' having practised black magic on him. Hadhrat Aaisha (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhu) said, 'O Prophet of Allah! Why don't you expose him?' Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) replied, 'Allah granted me Shifaa and I do not%0D%0Awant to spread evil among the people.' (Bukhari vol.2 pg.858)%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was a fountain of knowledge and%0D%0Arecepient of Divine revelations. His heart was imbued with deep light and%0D%0Ainsight, yet he did not accuse anyone of practising black magic on him.%0D%0AInstead, he resorted to Du'aa. Even after being Divinely informed he did not%0D%0Atake the matter further.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe change of behaviour of any person is not necessarily due to black magic%0D%0Aand Nazar. It could be due to something else. Therefore, we advise that in%0D%0Asuch situations, one should exercise wisdom and diplomacy and very politely%0D%0Aenquire personally or through a representative from the person directly the%0D%0Areason for the change of behaviour. One should avoid drawing a conclusion%0D%0Abased on suspicion as that leads to many misunderstandings which leads to%0D%0Aunnecessary grief and agony.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
