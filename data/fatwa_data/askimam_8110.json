  "question": "If the seller of a product does a mistake in charging the amount, is the customer liable to inform him?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. A friend bought a can of cooking oil from a super store. The cashier scanned the barcode and sold the oil can. After coming home it was known that the computer system, mistakenly has charged less than what was written on the can and on the shelf. Now is it haram to consume the oil and the remaining amount be paid? 2. After making several local and overseas calls, the balance of the mobile phone remains unchanged. Is it then permissible to make calls or the service providers should be informed of this error? Technically, making calls(local and overseas) will be halal or not?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssume the cashier scanned the barcode and mistakenly overcharged you. What would you do?\n\nJust as how one would go back to the store to reclaim the overcharge, it is your duty and responsibility to go back and inform them of their mistake in undercharging you. The same applies to the mobile phone. If the service providers overcharge you, definitely you will inform them. Therefore, it will not be permissible to keep quite and continue in both cases, the oil can and the mobile phone.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
