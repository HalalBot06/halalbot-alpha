  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am 24 years old girl and I got married more then 1 year before and I have spent very good time with my husband. Now Alhamdulillah I have a baby of 2 months. I am regularly breastfeeding him. My husband wants also to drink my breast milk and he has often tried to suck but I didn’t have allowed him although he has tried too much. And now he is angry with me because of my continuously deny. His behavior has become very rude with me from last few days. I want to know the point of view of Islam regarding to breastfeeding to husband. Is that allowed in Islam? If no then how should I behave with my husband if he pressurizes me? Please reply me soon because I don’t want to see my husband angry with me. Please tell me the easiest way because I cannot live without him and I also want to follow the rules of Islam. I shall be very thankful to you.\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe husband does not become haram upon the wife by taking in the milk of the wife. However, it is a great sin for the husband to take in the milk of his wife.\n\nمص رجل ثدي زوجته لم تحرم .\n\n (ولم يبح الارضاع بعد مدته) لانه جزء آدمي والانتفاع به لغير ضرورة حرام على الصحيح.\n\n(Dur-ul-Mukhtar Ma’a Hashiyah Raddul Muhtar Vol.3 Pgs.211 & 225 – H.M. Sa’eed Company)\nKifaytul Mufti Vol.5 Pg.166 – Maktabah Haqqaniyah\nFatawa Mahmoodiyah Vol.18 Pg.624 – Jamia’ Farooqiyah\n\nIt is true that the wife should try to please the husband as much as she can, but this does not allow her to break the rules of Shariah. Therefore, you should try your best to explain to your husband that it is sinful to take in the milk, and make him understand that he should fear Allah and not cross the borders of Shariah in fulfilling his desires.\n\nHowever, if he still does not understand and insists on doing this action, and further denial could lead to the breaking of the marriage, then you should allow him to do as he pleases and he will be held responsible for his sins. Your duty now will be to save the marriage as far as possible.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
