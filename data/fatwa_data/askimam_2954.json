  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it true that muslim husband can \"hit\" his muslim wife?. Why in some muslim countries, women is \"opressed\"?.It is not clear the rights of women in some Muslim Countries. Also in the Quran(In the surah of women), it explain how muslim husband or family should try their daughter of wife. What is the real truth of the life of the women in Islam?.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNIKAH - HUSBAND'S OBLIGATIONS%0D%0A%0D%0AHave you ever pondered over the Khutbah which the Imaam recited to you%0D%0Abefore you enthusiastically uttered 'Nakahtuhaa Wa Qabiltuhaa Wa%0D%0ATazawwajtuhaa?'%0D%0A%0D%0ALet me help you and shed some light over this contract which you have made%0D%0Ayourself party to, that is 'The Nikah Contract'. The Imaam recited to you%0D%0Athree verses from the Noble Qur%E3n:%0D%0A%0D%0ASurah Nissa (4) verse 1%0D%0AO Mankind Fear your guardian Lord who created you from a single soul, and He%0D%0Acreated from it its mate and from them He scattered many men and women.%0D%0ASurah Aale Imraan (3) verse 102%0D%0AO Ye who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared and die not except in a%0D%0Astate of Islam.%0D%0ASurah Ahzaab (33) verse 70%0D%0AO Ye who believe. Fear Allah and make your utterances straight.%0D%0ATAQWA%0D%0AThe common element in each of these verses is the Arabic word 'Taqwa' (God%0D%0AConsciousness). In these verses you are reminded to fear Allah Ta%E3la in the%0D%0Amanner you treat the lady you are taking as your wife. There is no one to%0D%0Asee the way you conduct yourself within your home. Let the fact and belief%0D%0Athat Allah is watching guide you in your treatment of the woman you have%0D%0Amade your wife by granting her the respect and dignity she deserves.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou have brought somebody's daughter into your own home. She left her%0D%0Afamily, her friends, close associates and in many cases even the town that%0D%0Ashe grew up in and she came to a strange environment just to share the rest%0D%0Aof her life with you. Was she handed over to you to be a target of your%0D%0Aphysical and verbal abuse?%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Prophet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) is reported to have said in%0D%0Aconnection with the treatment of animals: 'Fear Allah in your treatment of%0D%0Athese animals who cannot speak.' If this was his concern for the animals,%0D%0Ahow tremendously greater would his concern have been for humans; therefore,%0D%0Acan you imagine what his reaction would have been to the wife battering that%0D%0Atakes place nowadays?%0D%0A%0D%0AWhat then are the most important ingredients of a happy marriage? Allah%0D%0ATa%E3la says in Surah Roum (30) verse 21.%0D%0A'And from amongst His signs is that He created for you from amongst%0D%0Ayourselves partners, that you may live in tranquility with them, and He has%0D%0Acreated love and mercy between you. Verily in that are signs for those who%0D%0Areflect.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is this love and mercy that strengthens the bond of marriage. The ability%0D%0Ato overlook each other's faults goes a long way in cementing the%0D%0Arelationship. Once a man came to Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)%0D%0Aand said, 'O Allah's messenger, how many times should I forgive the wrongs%0D%0Aof my slaves.' The Prophet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) replied, 'Forgive%0D%0Athem seventy times a day.' If a worker is entitled to so much of compassion%0D%0Awhat about your lifelong companion?%0D%0A%0D%0ABEST OF YOU%0D%0AToday, we are very courteous to our clients, appreciative to our colleagues%0D%0Aand cheerful to our friends. Unfortunately this warmth is not extended to%0D%0Athe poor wife who is most deserving of this courtesy and charm. The Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, 'The most complete%0D%0Aof believers in faith are those who are best in character. The best of you%0D%0Aare those who are best to their wives.' (Mishkat)%0D%0A%0D%0AEvery person has shortcomings. It is therefore quite natural to find this in%0D%0Ayour partner. The Prophet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) has advised us to%0D%0Atake pleasure in the good and overlook the bad. Have you ever spared the%0D%0Athought that there may be so many habits which you possess that may be%0D%0Abringing grief to your wife? She may have been patiently bearing it not%0D%0Awanting to hurt your feelings.%0D%0ALet us go back and fulfil the demands of this contract.%0D%0A%0D%0ATREAT YOUR WIFE AS YOU WOULD LIKE YOUR SON-IN-LAW TO TREAT YOUR DAUGHTER.%0D%0A%0D%0ABy: Ml. I Khamissa%0D%0A%0D%0A"
