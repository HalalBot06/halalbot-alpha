  "question": "1.I have clothes (shalwaar kamiz) that are see through and one cannot do namaaz in them. Should I throw them away or give in charity to poor Muslims?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n2.it is a sunnat to read Surah Tabarak in 29 Parah every night or I think before going to sleep to keep away from azaab of grave. Do you have to read it right before going to sleep or any time after isha namaaz or can one read it any time after maghrib (since night starts right after maghrib)? 3. Same question as above for Surah Waqiya, when should we read it? 4.Can women wear high heel shoes? They usually make noise (like click, click) when you walk? What about the ones that do not make noise, can women wear those? 5. In ques # 5421, a dream is mentioned, does that show that we cannot eat mehdi pathan?s food? 6. Can we use body lotion (cream) that has animal ingredients (mostly from cow) that are not zabiha (no pork)? 7. Can we use face washes that have animal ingredients (mostly from cow) that are not zabiha (no pork)? 8. I know the answer is probably no but to make sure: Can we use soaps and shampoos that have pork in them? jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Since the clothes are transparent, you will not be able to wear them at%0D%0Aall or give it to somebody else to wear. You may wear it underneath another%0D%0Aset of clothes, or for any other purpose (get it sewn into a table cloth,%0D%0Arag, etc.)%0D%0A2. There are tremendous virtues in the Ahaadith about the recitation of Sura%0D%0ATabaarak. As you have mentioned, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has%0D%0Astated that it prevents one from punishment in the grave. The words of the%0D%0AHadith is 'night' which does not specify a particular portion of the night.%0D%0ATherefore, you may recite it any time from after Maghrib until before you%0D%0Asleep.%0D%0A3. Refer 2 above.%0D%0A4. If the sound given of by the shoe is an attractive one, towards which%0D%0Astrange men will be inclined, then this will not be permissible.%0D%0A5. That part of the dream has no significance.%0D%0A6. In order for us to comment, we need to know the exact ingredients and%0D%0Awhich part of the animal make up the ingredients.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
