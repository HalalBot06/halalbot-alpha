  "question": "I am engaged, and have commited adultry with my fiance? We don't want to be together, what should we do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaam, We got engaged like 8 months ago, according to our Parents decision (it's not that we were forced). We started spending time together and one thing led to another and we commited adultry. I never intended to do Zina, but i thought nikah was like an engagement(There was a imam present and also an eyewitness, who asked me infront of her father if i want to take her daughters hand, i had said yes). Now, we cannot live be with each other anymore, i have prayed for answers as to what is wrong with our relationship , and we have tried many times to make it better, but it's just getting worse day by day. Both sides of the parents know about it, but do not know about adultry. I cannot live with this fact, i need help regarding what should i do now, we've tried very hard, she does'nt want me, and i don't want to be with a person who does'nt want me also. We both are muslim. May Allah forgive me, for what i've done. Please help me, what should i do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah is Most Gracious and Most Merciful. He says in the Noble Qur'aan, 'Oh My Slaves! Do not despair. Verily Allah will forgive all sins.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIn one Hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, 'If a person has sins equivalent to the foams of the sea and pebbles on a desert, Allah's mercy is so encompassing that He will forgive every sin.' In another narration, it is mentioned that Allah will speak secretly to one of His slaves on the day of Qiyaamat and remind him of all his sins. After the person will confess his sins, Allah will say to him, 'I concealed your faults in the world, today too, I will conceal your faults. Go in Jannah, I have forgiven you.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above mentioned are few of many Ahaadith explaining the extent of Allah's Mercy. However, Allah says, 'Verily Allah will not forgive a person who ascribe partners (commit Shirk) with Him.' The only sin that is unforgivable is Kufr (disbelief) and Shirk (ascribing partners). Accepting Islam is the only atonement for the sin of Kufr and Shirk.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf one fulfils the conditions of repentance, i.e. regret and make firm intention to reform, then surely Allah Ta'ala is Tawwaab (Most Forgiving)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
