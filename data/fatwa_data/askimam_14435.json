  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCould you please tell me if there is an Aamil in the Houston,Texas area\n\nAsalamualaikum...Could you please tell me if there is an Aamil in the Houston,Texas area. I have been told that someone has written my husbands, mine and our children names on a piece of paper and buried it in a cemetary and they have sent 2 jinns to us. One stays with my husband and the other one stays in the house. I really need someone to help us.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe do not know of any Aamil in the Houston, Texas area.\n\nNevertheless, the information is strange. How does the informer know about the piece of paper. Did he see it? How do you know 2 Jinns are sent to you? There is no reason for you to believe in unsound information and disturb yourselves. Ignore all that and trust in the most powerful protector – Allah Ta’ala. Perform your five daily Salaats, recite Qur’aan, make Dhikr, give charity and recite Aayatul Kursi after every Fardh Salaat. No one will be able to harm you.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
