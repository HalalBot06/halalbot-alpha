Since you have issued her with three talaaqs, the nikah has permanently terminated. You cannot live with her as husband and wife. (hidayah, pg 402, chapter of Talaaq)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Ya'qoob Dadabhai,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
