  "question": "Do we believe in the prophet Daniel? and can you describe gog and magog?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have heard that the Hebrews believed in the prophet called Daniel who prayed towards Jerusalem is this true for Islam? what do yajuj and majuj look like? I have heard they are different human races black and white-what exactly are they in terms of nationality and ethnicity?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYes, Muslims also believe in the prophet Daanyaal. Historians say he was from among the Banu Israaeel.\n\nAs far as the appearance of Yaajooj and Maajooj is concerned, they are like normal human beings from the progeny of Nooh [alayhis salaam]. According to some, they are ethnically Turks. Others say they were the Tartars. They are according to some in Mongolia or behind the great wall of China. All of the above Riwaayaat and narrations are Israeli or Historical facts. None can be substantiated by strong Ahaadith. Therefore, one should not bother of those facts which do not affect one?s Imaam and A?amal. (Ma?ariful Qur?aan vol.5 pg.636-640)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
