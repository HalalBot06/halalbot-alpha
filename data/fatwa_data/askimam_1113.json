  "question": "Why some Muslims don't follow one of four imaam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs I am following imam Abu Hanifa (Hanafi). Some people perticularly \"ahle Hadis\" they says that \"Four imaam were not present at the time of Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam)\". Why we should follow one of them. What is your opinion?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhat is Taqlid or Ittiba ?%0D%0ATaqlid or Ittiba' is Wajib (compulsory) upon Muslims%0D%0ATaqlid or Ittiba' is W%E2jib (compulsory) upon Muslims. Yet there are many%0D%0AMuslims in the present age who have hardly heard of the words Taqlid or%0D%0AIttiba'. Others who may have heard about it, do not fully comprehend its%0D%0Ameaning. This has led to people even rejecting Taqlid - thereby rejecting a%0D%0AW%E2jib. As a general rule, man is suspicious and afraid of that which he does%0D%0Anot know. Therefore a proper understanding of the issue of Taql%EEd or Ittib%E2%0D%0Awould dispel the ignorance surrounding it, Insh%E2 Allah.%0D%0ATaqlid is a part of everyday life%0D%0ATaql%EEd or Ittib%E2 in essence, simply refers to the practice of an%0D%0Aunqualified, lay person (in a specific field of specialisation) submitting%0D%0Ato and accepting the authority of an expert in that field, without demanding%0D%0Aproof and justification for every view, opinion or verdict expressed by such%0D%0Aan expert authority. This is a natural state of human existence, practised%0D%0Aby millions of people worldwide in every facet of life. The simplest and%0D%0Amost tangible example of Taql%EEd or Ittib%E2 is that of a child learning his%0D%0Abasic alphabets at school. Every child learning his alphabets is%0D%0Aunconsciously practising Taql%EEd. A learner driver taking instructions from a%0D%0Adriving instructor is practising Taql%EEd. People going to a specialist doctor%0D%0Afor medical treatment and following his instructions is another glaring%0D%0Aexample of Taql%EEd or Ittib%E2. A lay person soliciting a legal opinion from an%0D%0Aadvocate or following the advice of a tax consultant is another common case%0D%0Aof Taql%EEd. A client at an engineering firm, asking for the engineer's advice%0D%0Aon complex engineering calculations is yet another instance of Taql%EEd or%0D%0AIttib%E2 in action. The millions of 'facts' in the myriad of sciences such as%0D%0Aastronomy, archaeology, etc. are all distinct examples of Taql%EEd or Ittib%E2%0D%0AWho ever questions the 'fact' or asks for proof that the sun is really 93%0D%0Amillion miles away from the earth! It is taken for granted that this is the%0D%0Afindings of the 'experts' in these fields and everyone simply accepts it as%0D%0Asuch. School teachers teach these to their pupils as 'gospel truth' and%0D%0Achildren learn and memorise these 'facts' with the hope of succeeding in%0D%0Atheir exams. There are countless such examples of Taql%EEd or Ittib%E2 in%0D%0Aeveryday existence. It is quite clear from the above, that Taql%EEd or Ittib%E2%0D%0Ais a natural way of life, and is not specific to Islam or Islamic Fiqh%0D%0Aalone.%0D%0ATaqlid is the easy option for ordinary people%0D%0AIn the context of Islamic Fiqh or Law, Taql%EEd or Ittib%E2 simply refers to%0D%0Aaccepting and following the verdicts of expert scholars of Islamic Fiqh in%0D%0Atheir exposition and interpretation of Islamic Law, without demanding from%0D%0Athem an in-depth explanation of the intricate processes required in arriving%0D%0Aat such a verdict, called Ijtihad. It simply means that ordinary folk do not%0D%0Ahave to do Ijtih%E2d, i.e. the intricate and complicated procedures involved%0D%0Ain deriving Islamic rulings that scholars exercise when issuing a Fatw%E2%0D%0A(legal verdict). The duty of ordinary people is to trustingly accept the%0D%0Aauthority of the learned scholars in this matter and act upon their%0D%0Averdicts.%0D%0AIn this sense, Taql%EEd is a great blessing for common people, for it is%0D%0Abeyond their capacity to understand the extremely complex and complicated%0D%0Amechanics of Ijtih%E2d. The ability to do Ijtih%E2d requires many long years of%0D%0Astudy and erudition and a great deal of exertion (Ijtih%E2d means to exert one%0D%0Aself) in acquiring a mastery of various Islamic sciences, among other%0D%0Avarying requirements.%0D%0AMisunderstandings regarding Taqlid%0D%0ARecently, misunderstandings have arisen regarding the issue of Taql%EEd. It%0D%0Ahas become a theme of major debate in many parts of the world among Muslims.%0D%0AThis debate has naturally resulted in arguments being promulgated by both%0D%0Athe protagonists and the antagonists of Taql%EEd.%0D%0AThe best way of removing such misunderstanding is to view the original%0D%0Asources of Islam - the Qur%E2n and Had%EEth and the teachings of the learned%0D%0Aelders of Islam on this subject. After a study of this subject, the correct%0D%0Ainterpretation and understanding of Taql%EEd and Ittib%E2 would emerge. This%0D%0Awould lead to a better understanding and analysis of the arguments and%0D%0Acounter-arguments of protagonists and antagonists.
