  "question": "has the time come for men to observe pardah? Why exactly is music unislamic?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nthere have been cases where women have raped men, and now it is common practice that women stare openly at men, and are not as docile as they were, dont you think men too should seek protection? also why is music unislamic? i feel it is instinct and even animals respond to it.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRefer music ? attached\n\nIn the Quran Allah Ta'ala commands chastity for both men and women (Surah Noor Aayahs no. 30,31)\n\nIt is entirely true that the tight fitting pants and figure hugging shirts for men that is the norm of the un-Islamic Western culture that has eroded our moral values are indeed provocative and enticing to the opposite sex. The Sunnah advocates use of loose fitting garments for males as well.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
