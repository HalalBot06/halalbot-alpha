  "answer": "QUESTION\nMufti Sahib, I recently prayed for something, it was something minor, but it held significance to me. It was accepted immediately. I cried and thanked Allah however, I also cried b/c I did feel the closeness to Allah, that he had listened to him. I cried so much that I asked Allah for his forgiveness and that I feared him. After all this, I felt really good. Is this Allah's way to guide his servants to the right path?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTawfeeq (the ability to do good) is from Allah Alone. Allah gave you the\nTawfeeq to thank Him for His bounties upon you and to turn to Him.\n\nContinue being thankful to Allah. He will increase His bounties upon you.\nAllah says in the noble Qur'aan, 'If you are grateful (to me), I will\nincrease (my bounties upon you).'\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
