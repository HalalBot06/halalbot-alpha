There are many ways in addressing marital problems. The social worker or Imaam may apply his discretion on the best possible way of handling the problem when the parties are in front of him. There is no set procedure in handling marital problems. They differ from case to case.\n\nSecondly, the wife should enquire from the husband directly if he has taken a second wife. Instead of going around and finding out of his marriage confront him directly and express your concerns over him taking another wife. In this way you will be able to circumvent many evils and save your marriage from ruin. Going to the Musjid and enquiring from others will upset him more and jeopardize your future.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa\n\nImportant Posts and Links\n\nShar'ii stance on Shares and Stocks|Have you prepared your WILL??|Moonsighting - Its that time to sight the moon"
