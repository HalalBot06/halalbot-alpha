  "question": "Is everything pre-dertermined? If yes, what is our part in going to jannat? If Allah knows evrything. that means it has happened right?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSo, please tell me what is our role is doing something if everything happens with the will of Allah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nTaqdeer refers to the absolute knowledge of Allah Ta’ala of everything even\nprior to its existence. Since the knowledge of Allah Ta’ala is perfect,\neverything will take place exactly according to his knowledge, but in the\ncase of our deeds it is through the choice of every individual.\n\nA person should adopt the means to do something. Thereafter, after the\naction has been done, the belief of Taqdeer comes in that everything\nhappened through the will of Allah Ta’ala. In one Hadith, Nabi (Sallallaahu\nAlayhi Wasallam) said, ‘Allah Ta’ala has already written the abode of every\nsingle person in Jahannam or Jannah. The Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) asked,\n‘O Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), should we not put our trust on our\nbooks, i.e. what has already been determined for us and leave out doing\nactions. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) replied, ‘Carry on doing\nactions. Everything will be made easy for what it has been created for.’\n\nand Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
