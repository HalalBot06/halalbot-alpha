  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni want to ask you a question regarding you article : HADITH AS STANDING AUTHORITY OF SHARI’AH,\n\ni just wondered if it is correct to say, Some Muslims do not accept them as authoritative, correct?, but i just wanted to know why, also isn't it correct that all althority lies with Allah, and therefore the Quran, but where does this place the hadiths ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe word authority is in relation to acceptability and credibility. It is not in comparison to the Authority of Allah. Allah is Supreme and nothing can surpass the Authority of Allah. You may also read the book \"Authority of the Sunnah\" by Mufti Taqi Usmani Saheb.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
