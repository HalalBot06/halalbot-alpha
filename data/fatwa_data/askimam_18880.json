  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. Is Iblis from the nation of Angels or from Jins. I heard that he was from Jins. But I read in a book that Iblis is from angels, which is mentioned in Surah Bakarh.\n\nPlease clarify.\n\n2. My boss gave me invitation to his daughter's birthday party. It will be a mixed sex gathering. Should I attend the bithday party with my wife?\n\nIf not, how can I tell my boss without creating any relation-problem? Is it permissable to give gifts in birthdays?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIn principle it is impermissible to attend a gathering where there is intermingling of sexes[1]. Furthermore as Muslims we do not celebrate birthday parties. For further enlightenment on this issue you can view fatwa #6627 on the ASK IMAM site.\n\nYou should explain to your boss that you appreciate his invitation but unfortunately your religion does not allow you to attend mixed gatherings of men and women nor is it part of our religion to celebrate birthday parties.\n\nIf doing so will jeopardize your job, then make a reasonable excuse to your boss for your absence.  This will make him feel that you did not disregard his invitation.\n\nUltimately you should understand that Allāh Tā`la is the one who sustains us and it is not ones job, profession, etc, that sustains and fulfils our needs. Hence we should put our trust in Allāh Ta`la and not  in our means. If you adopt Taqwa (Allāh consciousness) and abstain from the party then Allāh Tā’la will make a way out of this predicament for you.\n\n  Allāh Tā`la says in the Holy Qurān:\n\nWhomsoever fears Allāh, he will make for him a way out (of every problem), and he will sustain him from means he could never imagine. And whoever puts his trust in Allāh, then he will suffice him.\n\n(Surā.65, Verse,2/3)\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl. Muhammed Sindhi,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā\n\n\n\n\n و لو علم قبل الحضور لا يحضر لانه لم يلزمه حق الدعوة (الهداية ، كتاب الكراهية) و و من دعي الى و ليمة او طعام فوجد ثم لعبا او غناءا فلا بأس بالقعود.....[1]"
