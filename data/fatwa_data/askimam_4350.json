It presents the mu'tamad\nviews of the Shafi'i madhhab. It was translated by Shaykh Nuh Hamim Keller.\nThe translation is excellent, and the translator has added several\nappendices which enhance the value of the book.\n\nOn the whole, the book is an orthodox presentation of Shafi'i fiqh, while\nthe appendices might contain material that does not strictly fall under the\naegis of fiqh.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nShaykh Taha Karaan\nShaafi'ee Madhab - DARUL ULOOM AL-ARABIYYA AL-ISLAAMIYYA"
