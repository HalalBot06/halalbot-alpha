  "question": "Are there qoutes from jews,Adam,Abraham, in the Quraan by Allah are these the word of God? Also am I still muslim by asking this question?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah has related the words of Anbiyaa (Alayhimus salaam) etc. in the Quran\nby way of Hikaayah (narrative), i.e. their exact words have not been quoted\nbut have been relayed by Allah in a manner best suited to His Greatness,\nSupreme Ability and Eloquence.\n\nCertainly, no human being could have articulated his words in such a manner\nas adopted in the Quran. Provided one does not doubt the veracity and Divine\norigin of the Quran, no detriment to one's Imaan can arise from seeking of\nknowledge. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) stated \"The cure to ignorance\nlies only in questioning.\"\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
