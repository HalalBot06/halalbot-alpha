  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nBrother, I am a practicing Muslim. I have had my nikah some time ago. My question is, I have a Christian colleague and a few days ago, he said that his computer was dead, and I jokingly said “Rest in peace” and made a cross on my chest, like Christians do. I know this was a ridiculous thing to do and I just did it without even thinking what I was doing, but later I realized that this can be devastating. I did istaghfaar and reiterated kalima. Did this action made me leave the folds of islam? Do I need to get my nikah done again? Please reply in detail as I am really worried.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n Assalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nWe could not locate an explicit text in regards to making a cross on the chest as Christians do. However, it has been mentioned in the books of Fiqh that if a person wears a Jewish hat (which is a symbol of Judaism), or fastens a string around his body in pursuing the ways of Hindu priests, or attends ceremonies of other religions abiding by their practices, he will have entered into the folds of kufr.  (Fatawa al-Hindiyyah Vol.2 Pg.276 – Maktabah Rasheediyah)\n\nMoreover, it has been mentioned in the books of Fiqh that if one utters the words of kufr in jest, without intention of or belief in the meaning of the words, he will still have left the fold of Islam. (Al Bahr Al Raiq Vol.5 Pg.125 - Maktabah Rasheediyah)\n\nFurthermore, it has been mentioned that if one utters the words of kufr without knowledge that these words represent kufr, he will still have left the fold of Islam. Not having knowledge will not be considered an excuse for uttering the words of kufr.  (Fatawa al-Hindiyyah Vol.2 Pg.276 – Maktabah Rasheediyah)\n\n Therefore, as a matter of precaution, it was correct of you to reiterate the Kalimah and it will be advisable for you to renew your Nikah. In future, precaution should be taken in uttering such words.\n\nTo end thereof, non-Muslims are perpetually plotting to corrupt Islam and influence them with the ways and customs of non-Muslims. One of their strongest weapons is the media (television, internet, etc.). Hence, as Muslims, we have to arm ourselves well, to prevent ourselves from falling prey to them. We should try to find out the Islamic ruling in every matter and create an environment of Islam in our homes, workplaces, etc. May Allah Ta’ala save each and every one of us from falling prey to them and keep us on the straight and correct path. Ameen.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
