  "question": "Can a husband take a bath with his wife?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDear Sir, if any one take bath in washroom with her wife, with out cloth, even in water tab, is it include in sin or is the right of every husbend, that he will take bath with her wife. is it allow in islam, or is it not sin?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is permissible for a husband and wife to bath together. However, Islam emphasizes of shame and modesty. Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said, “Ieman and modesty are companions when one is lifted and the other is lifted.\n\nRasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said, “Shame is an important branch of Ieman”. It is therefore against shame for the husband and wife to be completely unclothed in front of each other while bathing.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
