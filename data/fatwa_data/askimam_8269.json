  "answer": "QUESTION\nI had a crush with a girl 3years ago before her marriage. I was a very bad boy those days; I mean not practicing the ways of Islam. But now I do practice Islam very much like growing the beard and not missing any prayer, so and so?. two days ago she called me and requested to visit her for she wants to tell me of some thing. Then I did. What she told me was her husband DIVOCED her 5 days ago. And we kept on talking and finally ended up with doing some bad things like kissing hugging and squeezing her breast and kissing it, so and so?????? I want to repent for this big sin and I know still she is in iddah (the 3 month period) and her husband can take her back if he wants. Qst is ?to repent do I have to go and ask her husband for forgiveness or what shell I do. I really regret this commitment of sin. Please help soon?..\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah is Most Gracious and Most Merciful. He says in the Noble Qur'aan, 'Oh My Slaves! Do not despair. Verily Allah will forgive all sins.' %0D%0A%0D%0AIn one Hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, 'If a person has sins equivalent to the foams of the sea and pebbles on a desert, Allah's mercy is so encompassing that He will forgive every sin.' In another narration, it is mentioned that Allah will speak secretly to one of His slaves on the day of Qiyaamat and remind him of all his sins. After the person will confess his sins, Allah will say to him, 'I concealed your faults in the world, today too, I will conceal your faults. Go in Jannah, I have forgiven you.' %0D%0A%0D%0AThe above mentioned are few of many Ahaadith explaining the extent of Allah's Mercy. However, Allah says, 'Verily Allah will not forgive a person who ascribe partners (commit Shirk) with Him.' The only sin that is unforgivable is Kufr (disbelief) and Shirk (ascribing partners). Accepting Islam is the only atonement for the sin of Kufr and Shirk. %0D%0A%0D%0AIf one fulfils the conditions of repentance, i.e. regret and make firm intention to reform, then surely Allah Ta'ala is Tawwaab (Most Forgiving)%0D%0A%0D%0AYou should renew your Tawbah and again make a firm intention never to repeat the sin.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is not necessary for you to seek the forgiveness of the husband. In future, you should severe all contact from this woman and do not respond to her call. Try to change your residence or at least your telephone numbers.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
