  "question": "earning income from bank is haram and my father worked for the bank for almost half of his life.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nmy father was serving in a banker for about 30Â  years, he bought a house after his retirement which we sold after his death and bought an apartment with that money, my question is is it halal to earn the income by renting that apartment because as the ULEMA said earning income from bank is haram and my father worked for the bank for almost half of his life.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are two issues regarding working in a bank. One is assisting in sin and the other is the condition of the income.\n\nA conventional bank deals in interest and other un-Islamic transactions. To work there will be assisting in the sin of interest and other un-Islamic practices and therefore it is not permissible to work in a conventional bank. However, if one worked in a bank and received wages, that is in lieu of his services. The income will be Makrooh and contaminated as he is providing his services to an avenue that is engaged in un-Islamic acts. However, if the person was desperate and he had no alternate employment but to work at the bank, then he will be excused. The rental from the apartment will be permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
