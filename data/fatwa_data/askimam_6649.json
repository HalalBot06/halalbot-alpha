  "question": "Is it permissblible for me too request for a discount on my goods from asomeone who has borrowed money from me...?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nA non-Muslim man has borrowed a sum of money from me. This sum is lying in his bank account, which he is using to accumulate interest. I also do buying from him. Will it be permissible for me to request a discount from him on this pretext that he is using my money to accumulate interest? If I do not tell him this, it is most likely that he would not give me a discount.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for you to request a discount.\n\nHowever, you cannot request a discount based on the loan given to the\nperson. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Every loan that\ndraws a benefit is Riba'.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
