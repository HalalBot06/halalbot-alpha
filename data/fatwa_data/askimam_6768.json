  "question": "I am in grade 11 and i prefect elections will soon take place. Would it be permissible for me to be elected as a prefect at my school?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI attend a mixed christian school (boys and girls together) and i have been told that as a Muslim girl, i am unable to undertake the role of a prefect as women cannot take leadership roles. Due to the fact that we will have to look over boys and be a 'guardian' over them. Would it be permissible for me to be elected as a prefect at my school?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAny form of intermingling between Ghayr Mahram (not prohibited in marriage) boys and girls is prohibited. It will, thus, not be permissible for you to accept the position as a prefect in the school.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
