Take permission for the first year (in five years) and then for subsequent 4 years go for hajj without permission and go through the check points. If check point staff allows, go for Hajj otherwise return back. 3. Perform Hajj only once in five years.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHajj is Fardh only once in a lifetime if one has the financial means.\n\nThe Saudi government has placed restrictions for management reasons.
