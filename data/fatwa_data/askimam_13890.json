  "question": "people who does not offer namaz in time and delay namaz they get less sawab(reward)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI heard that those people who does not offer namaz in time and delay namaz they get less sawab(reward)? and those praying 5 to 10 minutes before time, there namaz is not accepted and they are sinner(gunehgaar)?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Salaat is one of the foremost important pillars of Islam for which one will be accountable in the court of Allah. In view of this, one should endervour to fulfil this obligation bearing in mind all its conditions and pre-requisites. Amongst these is that Salaat should be performed at the correct time. Allah states, ‘Verily, Salaat is prescribed on the believers at stated times.’ (Surah4 Aayat103). Furthermore, by delaying one’s Salaats, one is deprived of the reward of practising on the great Sunnah of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] of performing Salaat with Jamaat for which the reward is multiplied 27 times (as compared to Salaat offered individually).’ (Muslim Hadith1475). However, if due to some pressing need one is forced to delay the Salaat, the Salaat will be valid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
