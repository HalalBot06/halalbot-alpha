  "answer": "QUESTION\nSelam ! Sometimes in my daily life I see things that I'm very sure I have seen before. I don't mean objects, but actions . It's like something is happening right now and as it is happening I know that I have seen that happening before, but I don't know how it is going to end until it happens and then I again remmember that I have seen it before. One of my friends told me that it happens to him too, and he thinks that he sees that happenning in his dreams. Please tell me if that means something or is there shaytan or some jinn playing with our minds. Jazzakallahhair dear brother\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis is a normal phenomenon for many people and is nothing to be concerned about.\n\nIf you feel your mind wandering, make the zikr of Allah or read \"Aamantu billahi warasoolihi\"\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl.
