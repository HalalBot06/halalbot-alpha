  "question": "Commited a premarriage SIN with a catholic girl and now she is pregnant. Letting it ABORTED before 120 days is it allowable or a BIGGER SIN?? Also is it allowable to marry a catholic for a muslim?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamun Allaykum... I committed the big sin as the first time with a catholic girl and now she is also pregnant. I think I am not ready to marry her and I am a muslim and she is a conservative christian. Insallah Allah will forgive me for what I did. Coming to my questions brother, What says the Islam`s way for abortion?I read many articles on internet but I think my situation having a child before marriage and from a christian makes it more complex. There are some subjects about before and after 120 days (4 Months) for abortion.In that aspect ours is less than 40 days.So abortion is a solution or a BIGGER SIN??? Coming to the other question realeted with above, what says Islam for the marriage between a muslim guy and a christian women?What shall I do?? I can not find a way out... Sorry for bothering you with my problems and thanks for your advice and answers. Help Allah me and all of us and shows the right way. Assalamun Allaykum...\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for a Muslim female to marry a non-Muslim male. However, a Muslim male may marry only Christian or Jewish female. It is not permissible for a Muslim male to marry any other non-Muslim female.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe reason it is permissible for the Muslim male to marry a non-Muslim female is that he would be able to easily convince the Christian or Jewish wife into accepting Islam. There is a possibility of the non-Muslim male convincing his Muslim wife into abandoning Islam. Therefore, Islam has considered her feminine nature and protected her correct beliefs from being a victim of abuse from the male dominance.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Muslim husband is not obliged to pressurise his Christian%2FJewish wife to accept Islam. He may apply wisdom and diplomacy and only influence her to Islam. In Islam, a female is equally respected as a male, however, due to the different masculine and feminine natures, Islam believes in separation of roles. It is obvious that there are many things a male can do, which is not easily possible for a female and vice versa.%0D%0A%0D%0AMarriage is a major step and you should exercise precaution in choosing your marriage partner by making Mashwara with your seniors as well as make Istikhaara (seek divine guidance).%0D%0A%0D%0ARefer attached on abortion.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
