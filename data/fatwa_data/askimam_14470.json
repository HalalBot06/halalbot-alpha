  "question": "Do wahabees do taqleed? Some people say they are hanbali and some say they are anti taqleed.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Do wahabees do taqleed? Some people say they are hanbali and some say they are anti taqleed. Whats the truth? If they are anti taqleed then how is it that their founder was a hanbali and the followers became anti taqled? 2. I have a problem deciding which masjid to go to in my local area. This is because we have a wahabi masjid  and a brelvi masjid (myself am deobandii). The wahabi masjid has two imams one who doesn’t wear a hat and one of the imams is clean shaven. They also place the quran in a low shelf on their bookshelf. The brelvi masjid has a picture of rasullah’s roza in the direction of prayer and it feels like we are bowing in front of it when we read namaz. Which of the two masjids do you recommend if any? 3. the brelvi masjid recently did a janaza for a jafari man. This to me looks completely impermissible. Is it allowed for us to send isale sawab on jafaris?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. According to our information, some of the Wahhaabees adhere to Taqleed whilst some of them do not. Some of them are Hanbalees, some Maalikis and some do not adhere to any Madhab at all.\n\n2. If there is no other Musjid in the vicinity, try and determine the beliefs of the Imaam in the Barelwi Musjid. If his beliefs seem in order and outwardly he seems like a reliable person, you may continue following him. If you still feel uneasy, you may repeat your Salaat on your own. However, on no account should you abandon Salaat with Jamaat in the Musjid.\n\n3. Jafaris are a deviated sect of the Shi’as. It was incorrect of them to perform his Janaaza Salaat. No, you should abstain from sending Isaal-e-Sawaab to such people.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
