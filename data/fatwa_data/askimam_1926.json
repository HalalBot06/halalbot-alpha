  "question": "Assalaamu alaykum wa rahmatullah.Your explanatory article mentions many ahadeeth from shi'a sources that you claim invalidates their faith.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n...Yet, unlike Ahl as-Sunnah, the shi'a do not claim that their ahadeeth collections are flawless as Ahl as-Sunnah does since humans put them together (which makes sense to me), therefore any hadeeth conflicting the Qur'an is not considered authentic. Now how is it you can call the shi'a non-Muslims? I was just curious as to your thoughts of the above-mentioned question. Many of the ahadeeth you mentioned in your article at http://www.jamiat.org.za/isinfo/shia_fal.html are noted by the shi's sources as having weak transmission, therefore they are likely not authentic. Shouldn't you mention this in your article? Isn't it misleading not to do so? Also, the grand mufti of al-Azhar University, the highest school of Ahl as-Sunnah, recognizes the shia as the fifth school of thought. This especially makes sense since both Imam Abu Hanifah and Imam Malik were students of Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq, and Imam Shafi'i and Imam Ibn Hanbal were students of his students. For those who don't know, Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq is the 6th shi'a Imam. Since you claim that the shi'a are not Muslim, are you saying the teacher of your 4 Imams was not Muslim also? JazakumAllahu khayr for your time... I am not trying to create fitnah but rather need to get a grasp on this issue... wassalaamu alaykum.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\n1. Kindly define Hadith as understood by the Shi'a clergy. Also give examples of some Ahaadith quoted by the Ahlus Sunnah and accepted by the Shi'as.\n\n2. We are aware of Shaykh Shaltut of Al-Azhar having issued the verdict. We have tried to communicate with the (Al-Azhar) many times but in vain. Should you be successful in reaching them, do inform us of our efforts to reach them. Shaykh Shaltut is known for issuing unpopular and unfounded decrees.\n\n3. Our ruling refers to contemporary Shi'as whose beliefs are inconsistent with the beliefs of our respected Hadhrat Jaafar al-Saadiq.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
