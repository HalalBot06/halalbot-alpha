  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have 2 daughters and my problem is that a few months before my wife told me that I had raped through my cousin. My wife was already in 2nd or 3rd month of pregnancy at that time. She afraid to tell me because of divorce. My cousin come to my home regularly in my presence or absence, when I m not at home my wife allow him to enter the home. When this thing happened I didn?t doubt to my wife because I trust on her, but after few weeks I note that some thing is wrong with both of them then I doubt her but I didn?t ask her. But after few months my wife take me in confidence and told me she raped. I request her to tell the truth either she raped or both of you agreed upon this. She swears upon Allah and said that she was raped. I also ask that man that why he do so, in first he didn?t accept any thing and he said that both of us didn?t do any thing but when I force him he told me that at first I (means my cousin) ask to her to do so but she didn?t agree but after few days she agree and they have intercourse with each other. Please help me I divorce her or I forgive her or any other Islamic rule please tell me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour wife confessed to you in confidence her relationship with the person. She could have concealed that. She was quite honest by revealing to you the incident. You have two children from her. The option of divorce will have serious implications on the lives of the children.\n\nWe advise you forgive your wife and continue life with her. Advise your wife of the fear of Allah and accountability in the court of Allah. She should make Taubah and Istighfar.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
