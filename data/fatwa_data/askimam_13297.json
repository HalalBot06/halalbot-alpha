  "question": "Our company uses a pirated software",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nOption to use Pirated Software I am sorry I could not put the whole situation in picture when I asked my question last time regarding the use of pirated software.Here in my company, I have been using some paper road maps of Mecca Al Mukarramah that are not that clear as compared to high resolution satellite photographs of Mecca roads. Our company uses a pirated software to view these satellite photos. I have an option to use these photos to perform my task very efficiently. However I can rely on low quality paper maps but I am afraid it would effect the quality of my work. Having these options with me, I want to know If I am allowed to use this software?\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYou may request your company to purchase the official software. If the use of the pirated software will enhance the quality of your work, it will unjustly effect and harm the actual owner of the software.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
