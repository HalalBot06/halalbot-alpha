  "question": "If I missed my Zuhr salaat. Am I allowed to perform Qaza for this in the time between Asr and Magrib? As I was told that no Qadhaa namaaz can be read during this time.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible to perform the Qadhaa of your Dhuhr Salaat after the Asr\nSalaat till before sunset. However, a little before sunset, when the sun's\nrays lose their heat and become yellowish, Qadhaa Salaat becomes prohibited.\n(Shaami vol.1 pg.375)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
