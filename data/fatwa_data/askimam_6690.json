Do one can have a honour of seeing Rasullah [sw] in his dream b/c i as far as i know shatan can not come in his form even in dream is this true right plz explain all the matters thank you\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) had 7 children in total, 3 boys and 4 girls. In the infinite wisdom of Allah Ta'ala, He took back the 3 sons of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) before they reached the age of puberty.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. One of the daughters and wife to Hadhrat Uthmaan (Radhiallaahu Anhu) had passed away shortly after the battle of Badr. Family lineage works as a tree, the branches are your descendants. Thus, Hadhrat Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu) was not the descendant of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), hence his children will not be considered as the descendants of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) except his children with Hadhrat Faatima (Radhiallaahu Anha), who was the daughter of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). As for the other 2 daughters of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), there are no narrations saying that they had any children whom may have attained puberty.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Yes, one may be blessed with the honour of seeing Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) in a dream as Shaytaan cannot take the form of Nabi (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam). one who has seen Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) in a%0D%0Adream has most definitely seen Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
