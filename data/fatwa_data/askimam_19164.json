  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have to clean my children while I am in wudu. Does it break the wudu or not?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nCleaning and washing one’s children does not break the wudu. However, while doing so, ensure that impurity does not get on your body and clothes. If impurity does get on your body or clothes, then before you perform salaat, it will be compulsory to wash off the impurity if the combined size of the impurity is more than a Dirham (approximately 2.75 cm in diameter). If its size is equal to a Dirham or less, it will be mustahabb (desirable) to wash it off, not compulsory.\n\n \n\n(Ahsanul Fataawa: 2/89, 95-96, Saeed)\n\n(Shami: 1/574, Darul Ma’rifa)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMl.
