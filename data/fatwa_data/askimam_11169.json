  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe argue day and night about who is wrong and right. Sisters dress tight, have poor attitudes, do not take hijab, and want to constantly be out alone. I am the only son in the house after the death of my father. Allah yirhamo. I am not perfect either, I dont always pray my 5 prayers, i have stresses and we argue non stop in my home since the death of my father. I know I should become closer to my Islam Inshallah. But WHAT should I do as far as guiding my sisters and guiding my mother on what to say and do towards us (the kids)? I just want my family to be good muslims and get along and make it to Jannah Inshallah ! Please Advise?

Also do remember everyone in your family was affected by your father's demise and probably felt the pain.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou as a brother possibly shoulders many responsibilities. Start off - with yourself Adjust your attitude, take stock, start being kind and showing love to your family, ask about their well-being, smile- see to their needs, exchange gifts - for building of love. This will Insha-Allah build their confidence in you and soften your relationship..%0D%0A%0D%0AThen on a personal level make sincere Tauba for all your sins and start putting things right. Make a firm intention and move to read you 5 times salaah and all the areas you need to put right, atleast make the effort.%0D%0AYou will not need to give lectures to your sisters, your very own practise will be an example and motivation. Allah Ta'ala will Insha-Allah become pleased with you.%0D%0A%0D%0ADo try - let us know your outcomen as you make your changes in life.%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala help you and grant you success.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A2SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
