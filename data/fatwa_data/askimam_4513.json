  "question": "If there are only 2 mins left for the expiry of Zohar salat then should you bother starting the 4 rakats or not?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti, If there are only 2 mins left for the expiry of Zohar salat and you know that it takes longer than 2 mins for you to pray 4 (fardh) rakaats, (for example 3-4 mins) then should you bother starting the 4 rakats or not? Secondly, if you did start the 4 rakats, with full knowledge that u will not be able to complete within Zohar time, and u finished in Asr time then can this count as your Qadha for Zohar? Thirdly, about nifas: If a woman bleeds for only 10 days does she have to wait for 15 days of tuhr before she can count any bleeding as haidh and not nifas? May Allah reward you for all your unfaltering efforts.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf there are only two minutes left for Dhuhr Salaat, perform your Fardh of%0D%0ADhuhr in such a manner that the four Rakaats can be accommodated in this%0D%0Atime. Whilst performing this Salaat, leave out the Sunnah actions like%0D%0ABismillah, Thanaa, Du'aa, etc. and hasten slightly with the Fardh actions%0D%0Aonly in this way, the 2 minutes can accommodated the 4 Rakaats.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, if you were unable to do this and your Dhuhr Salaat stretched into%0D%0Athe time of Asr, this Dhuhr Salaat will be regarded as Qadhaa.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf a woman in Nifaas bleeds for 10 days and thereafter she does not bleed%0D%0Afor a few days and her bloodflow resumes after a few days this entire period%0D%0Awill be regarded as though she bled continuously. If this is within 40 days,%0D%0Athe entire period will be regarded as Nifaas. If she bleeds for more than 40%0D%0Adays, one will revert to her habit (if she has one) and the remainder will%0D%0Abe Istihaadha.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Kadwa%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
