  "question": "Convert - who inherits what? I am a new convert. I am single and don't have any muslim family. My family consist of my parents and a brother. What portion should each of them receive on my death?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFrom your question, we understand that your parents and brother are not\nMuslims. In principle, there is no inheritance between Muslims and\nnon-Muslims. However, there may be Wasiyyat (bequeath) between Muslims and\nnon-Muslims.\n\nWe suggest you draw up an Islamic Will stipulating who you wish to bequeath\nyour estate to. If at the time of death, there are no Muslim relatives, the\npersons (parents, brothers, etc.) / organizations whm you have stipulated\nwill receive the entire estate in the proportion you have stipulated.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
