  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nIs it permissible to be a participant in a sponsored mountain climbing trip [Kilimanjaro] where the climb is done in aid of orphans in Afganistan. The muslim charitable organisation is asking that each particpant bring in a minimum sponsorship of eg R30000.00 which has to be paid to them 75% in value 6 weeks before the event. The participant will have to pay for his own airfare and accommodation, maybe at a discounted rate.\n\nIs it allowable to use the musjid notice board to stick posters soliciting sponsorship?\n\nLastly is it allowable to collect zakaat as part of the sponsorship from friends and family?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIt is a sad reality that whenever a disaster takes place anywhere around the world, people gather in various ways and some do weird things in the name of raising funds. In most cases, such funds are collected primarily for their own interests. Instead of assisting the widows, orphans and refugees, they have rather used them as a means of acquiring funds which will also be used in their interest.\n\nIf a person feels sympathy for those orphans and widows around the globe, there is no need to climb a mountain or to engage in any other activity. He should forward his charities (no restrictions of a minimum amount) to a reputable organisation which will convey his charity to its desired destination.\n\nHow will climbing Mount Kilimanjaro assist the orphans in Afghanistan? Why can’t the R30 000. 00 go directly to the course? What is the point of wasting airfare and accommodation to reach and stay at Mount Kilimanjaro? That amount could also be contributed to the orphans in Afghanistan and other places.\n\nThe concept of being entertained or fed before contributing to a worthy course, does not manifest the claim of pain in ones heart for the poor, underprivileged and victims of unfortunate circumstances.\nThis concept of collection should not be advertised and promoted. People should be encouraged to revert to the sunnah method of contributing and assisting.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftāa"
