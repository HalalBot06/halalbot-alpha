  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan a woman travel alone overseas to see her ill parents, as her husband cannot afford the cost of their travelling together or sending any other ‘mehram’ with her? Mufti Sahib Says: She can travel alone. The condition of a ‘mehram’ accompanying her in a journey no longer applies for the types of travel nowadays.\nKindly comment on the following fatwa Question: Can a woman travel alone overseas to see her ill parents, as her husband cannot afford the cost of their travelling together or sending any other ‘mehram’ with her? Mufti Sahib Says: She can travel alone. The condition of a ‘mehram’ accompanying her in a journey no longer applies for the types of travel nowadays.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIn principle it is not permissible for a woman to travel alone in any circumstances.[1] There are many incidents of women having been put into extreme difficulty and their chastity been attacked by travelling alone in short and long distances. No mode of transport is error-proof and no woman is chaste-proof, especially in these times of vice and immorality.\n\nNabi Sallalahu Allaihi Wassallam mentions in a hadith;\n\nحدثنا قتيبة بن سعيد حدثنا سفيان عن عمرو عن أبي معبد عن ابن عباس رضي الله عنهما أنه  سمع النبي صلى \n\nالله عليه و سلم يقول لا يخلون رجل بامرأة ولا تسافرن امرأة وإلا معها محرم فقام رجل فقال يا رسول الله  اكتتبت في غزوة كذا وكذا وخرجت امرأتي حاجة قال اذهب فحج مع امرأتك.\n\n\n\nA man cannot be in seclusion with a woman nor can a woman travel except with a mahram… (Bukhārī)[2]\n\nFurthermore in light of the above, we as believers should express our true submission to the laws of the Shari'ah. Allah Ta'ala is al-Hakeem (the All-Wise) and He and His Prophet  Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam know the wisdom of the laws of the Shari'ah. Our responsibility is to express true submission to the laws of Allah Ta’ala and His Rasul Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam, whether we understand them or not. Know well that every law of the Shari'ah is filled with wisdom. That includes the prohibition of female travelling long distances without a Mahram.\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMufti Luqman Hansrot,\nChecked and Approved by:\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā\n\n\n\n\n[1] رد المحتار , سعيد , ج2 , ص 465.\n\n[2] صحيح البخاري ، كتاب الجهاد والسير ، باب من اكتتب في جيش... , دار ابن كثير, ج3 ,ص1094."
