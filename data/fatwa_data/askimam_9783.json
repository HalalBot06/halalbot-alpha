May Allah Reward you on helping me as I am really much tensed\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for writing to the institute about your present dilemma. You desire a certain woman to become your prospective wife.%0D%0A%0D%0AAn engagement between a man and a woman in Islam is not acceptable. When you are ready for marriage and your match is found, your nikah has to be performed as soon as possible. The concept of getting engaged and then meeting with and mingling with a fiancee is not part of the Islamic culture. As long as a woman is not your wife and therefor not your mahram, you have no right to be alone with her. Nor should you be gazing at her or desiring her in your heart. If you have a problem with this, you should fast constantly to appease and control your desires.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou say you are still studying. This means you are not in a position to support a wife at the moment. You also state that her parents want her to marry someone else. Allow me to suggest that whilst you are studying, you set aside a few hours a week to study more about the commandments of Allah Ta'ala. Study the Quran in depth so that you become more conversant with your Islamic duties, responsibilities, obligations, what is halaal%2Fharaam etc. Insha'allah, when you seek knowledge of deen which will take you closer to Allah Ta'ala, His mercy will descend on you. You should rather concentrate on arming youself with knowledge which will benefit you in this world and the hereafter. In this way you will be able to cast off whatever bad habits you have. This will also help to prepare you towards seeking a pious partner. Perform your five daily salaah without fail, increase the performance of nafl salaah, especially tahadjud salaah, zikr, istigfaar, and recitation of the Holy Quran and read it with understanding.%0D%0A%0D%0AAll Muslims are guided to seek pious partners who have the fear and love of Allah Ta'ala in their hearts. You will insha'llah be granted a pious wife who will be a joy to you in this world and the hereafter. Ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A1SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
