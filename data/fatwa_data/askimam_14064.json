  "question": "Fatwa # 14025 - if the army option is not available, and the only option available is to take the student loan from the bank, where the bank charges only interest during the period of studying",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease clearly explain what you mean in the Fatwa #  14025 , 3rd option?\n\nAslo, if the army option is not available, and the only option available is to take the student loan from the bank,  where the bank charges only interest during the period of studying and then charges interest plus actual amount after, should one take this option or forget about studying because funds are not available?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe third option does not suggest that you enter into an interest bearing loan. This is Haraam and expressly prohibited in the Quraan. Therefore if the other two alternatives do not work out, you rather find another suitable job and try to earn a halaal and pure living. Allah is the provider and He has written what you would get. A little halaal income of that has the Barakat and blessings of Allah is far better than that income that is plenty and void of Allah’s blessings.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
