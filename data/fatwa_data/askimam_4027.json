  "question": "Is the following co-ownership financing contract acceptable per Shariah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am buying a $100,000 house, and am $25,000 short. A 'friend' comes up with the $25,000. The house is purchased and registered in MY name. I sign another contract with my friend saying, he is 25% non-resident owner of the house, and I can buy him out. We both obtain the fair rental value of the house ($1000 per month). I buy him out at the end of 1 year by paying him $25000 + (12X250) = $28,000. i.e., his share plus 1 year's rent. Is my paying of $28,000 for his $25,000, which is totally based on the rental value, considered Interest? {If the house is registered in both the names, it gets quite complicated in terms of changing it later, and insurance and tax liabilities}\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe purchased house will be in partnership between you and your friend, and\nthe rental income will be distributed according to the proportion of the\nshares.\n\nThe subsequent and independent contract to purchase the house is correct.\nThe partner may sell his quarter share more than the purchase value of\nR25,000 if he wish to. Once he sells his house, he is not entitled to a\nrental income.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
