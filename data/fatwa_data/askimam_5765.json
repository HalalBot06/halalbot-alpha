  "question": "Waiting for the marriage and suffering from pimples.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Mufti Sahab, As-salamualaikum. I am from Pakistan and I am pursuing my studies in overseas. I will be graduating very soon and after my graduation I want to get married. My parents have found a girl for me already. But the girl is still studying in Pakistan and she will take two and half year more to finish her studies. Now, I want to know should I get married after my graduation and then let her stay there and finish with her studies, or, should I get married only when she is done with her studies? Few of my friends told me that it?s not good to get married and keep the wife away. They told me that if I get married and then if I cannot get her with me then it will cause more distraction and then the craving to look at other females will be higher. Is that so? Give me advice. 2) I am suffering from pimples and they are leaving permanent scars on my face. What should I do to get myself cured from pimples and scars?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Marriage is a shield, which protects one from many evils. This bountry of\nAllah is in order to give man peace of mind. Man married or unmarried can\nvery easily be enticed to commit evil. One, at all times, must protect one;s\neyes from lustful glances. However, for a married man, it is easier for him\nto protect himself. Thus, I advise you to marry as soon as possible and have\nyour wife stay with you.\n2. There are many solution to pimples, many creams, etc. are available.\nHowever, your problem seems to be in a later stage, thus, it would be\nadvisable to see a medical practitioner who would refer you to a\ndermatologist. May Allah ease your problems, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
