  "question": "Is my Husband Haraam on me",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease can you shed some light on my dilemma.  A few nights ago whilst lying in bed i awoke from my sleep and felt what i thought was my husbands feet on top of me.  I  tapped the feet  but I think I only did that so that my husband would lift up his feet as I felt uncomfortable.  Unfortunately after the feet moved, I realised it was my three year old sons feet and not my husbands. I am not 100% sure if i touched him with lust or not or whether i just touched his feet so he would move them.  please answer my question , is my husband haram on me.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nNo, your husband is not Haram on you.\n\nوكذا تشترط الشهوة في الذكر حتى لو جامع ابن أربع سنين زوجة أبيه لا تثبت به حرمة المصاهرة ، كذا في فتح القدير .\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
