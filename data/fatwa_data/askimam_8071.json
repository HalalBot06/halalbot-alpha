  "answer": "QUESTION\nA friend of mine told me that it is bid'at to listen to nasheeds as it cannot be linked back to any hadiths, be found in the Quran or in any of the practises of the Prophet Muhammed S.A.W or the Sahaba R.A. Is there any authentic ahaadiths that can be found that counter this argument?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNasheeds will fall under the category of poetry.\n\nThere are numerous Ahaadith substantiating the recitation of poems at various occasions. Hadhrat Hassaan ibn Saabit (Radhiallaahu Anhu) was the well-known special poet of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) who used to recite poetry in praises of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Therefore, as long as these Nasheeds are recited in good spirits have a good meaning and most importantly do not entail musical instruments, it is totally permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
