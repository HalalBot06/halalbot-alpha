  "question": "Can we discharge our zakat money to Afghanistan.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Assaalmu-alaikum Mufti Saheb: The person who is collecting the money for Afghanistan is pious Muslim who can be trusted. He gives us an assurance that the money will be used in the right way. But I do not know whether it will be used for the poor people in the refugee camps or for some other purpose. Under these circumstances will my zakat be discharged? 2.Assalamoaaikum respected Mufti sahab! Is it true that some aayahs which were revealed by Allah (swt) were told not to be included in the Quran by the Prophet Muhammad (saw)? For example, it is said that previously there was an ayat saying that ?Oh Muslims, do not drink (wine) during prayers?. But later on as alcohol was set haram, then the aayah was obsoleted. 3.I follow the Hanafi madhab. When I pray sunnah in the mosque, Shafai Muslims come and make me the imam without takbir, by just touching me or saying Allah o Akbar. Should I fulfill my responsibilities as an Imam as I am not praying fardh at that time? 4. Is celebrating shabe Bar?at an invention? What is the sharai stand of it and is there any Hadith for this, or sahab-e-kiram RaziAllahuAnhum Wa Ajmaeen have practiced this?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In order for the Zakaat to be discharged, it must be given in the\npossession of a poor and needy Muslim. The poor person may use the money as\nhe wish to, food clothing, arms, etc. Alternatively, such items may be\npurchased and given to the poor and needy. If the person is trustworthy and\nis well aware of the Shari'ah laws of Zakaat, you may entrust him with the\nresponsibility of discharging your Zakaat.\n2. The verse, 'Oh you believe, do not go close to Salaat whilst you are\nintoxicated is abrogated but is in the Qur'aan in Surah al-In'aam.\n3. According to the Shaafi'ee Madhab, it is permissible for a person to\nperform Fardh Salaat behind a person performing Sunnah and Nafl Salaats. If\na Shaafi'ee joins you, you may continue with your Fardh Salaat.\n4. Shab'e Baraat - refer attached.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
