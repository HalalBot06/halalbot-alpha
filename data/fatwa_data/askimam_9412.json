  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. I have heard that Sauda AS, prior to her marraige to Rasulullah SAW, when she was grieving the death of her husband, used to recite a particular dua. I am looking for this dua both in arabic and english please. 2. I would also like to know the correct transliteration for a dua that appeared in another question and where can I find it in arabic? It was apparently for any type of difficulties. It read sumthing like this \"Kul innal fadlaa bi yadil laahi yu ti hi may yashaa Wallaahu waasi un aleem Yagh ta shaa birahmatika may ya shaa Wallaa hu dhul fadlil azeem\" Also is this dua meant to worn or recited or both and could you please tell me how, when etc. Jazakallah khair and please remember me in your duas.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The particular wife of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) mentioned in the story as far as we have been able to ascertain is Umme Salamah (Radhiallaahu Anha). She had heard from Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) that a person struck with a calamity should recite the following Dua: Allaahumma' jurnee fee museebatee Wakhlufni khairan minhaa. (Trans: Oh Allah! Recompense me in my affliction and grant me something better). Please refer Fadzaa'ile A'maal (Pg 207 Waterval Islamic Institute) for details.\n\n2. The Dua in question is actually part of Aayah no.73 and 74 of Surah Aali 'Imraan(The Family of Imraan). The correct transliteration is as follows: Qul Innal Fadhla biyadillaahi Yu'teehi man yashaa' Wallaahu waasi'un aleem. Yakhtassu birahmatihee man yashaa' Wallaahu dhul fadhlil 'azeem.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
