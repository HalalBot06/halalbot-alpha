  "question": "Is it allowed to go to stage shows where women or men perform? some men once came to the prophet (pbuh) and performed some sort of dance in the mosque.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nOne person told me that some people have this misconception that entertainment is not allowed in Islam. He quoted me a hadith in which it says that, some men (I think he said they came from some place in Africa) once came to the prophet (pbuh) and performed some sort of dance in the mosque. The prophet agreed to it and also Aisha (r.a) watched the dance while placing her head on the shoulders of the prophet (pbuh). He says in the light of this hadith it is fine if men and women equally alike go to stage shows where men and women perform. Also can salah with jamat be performed if there is only one man and one woman only provided the woman stands behind the man. Also Can woman do jamaat if they are two or more as well?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. This is a gross injustice on the Hadith of Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam]. This Hadith is recorded in Sahih Bukhari (Hadith 454; 455) and there is no mention of any dance. In fact, these Abyssinians were practising Archery, and not dancing. There is no substantiation for the claim of this person in this Hadith and in other sacred text of the Shari?ah, i.e. Hadith or Qur?aan. May Almighty Allah protect us from such ignorant conclusions concerning His pure pristine religion of Islam. And may He protect us from following our desires. It is precisely for this reason that we discourage the general masses from individually studying the Qur?aan and Hadith with no guidance from any learned, pious, practising Aalim of Deen.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Yes, provided they are Mahrams and not strangers to each other.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. According to the Hanafi Madhab, it is Makrooh for women to perform their own congregations with a female Imaam.
