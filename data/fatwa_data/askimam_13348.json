A probing study of the Qur’aan and Hadith reveal that the Shari’ah not only sanctions, but promotes that we value and prize the innumerable bounties that we are endowed with. Moreover, a believer is encouraged to be strong, robust and healthy. To this end, the sport of bodybuilding may be warranted.\n\nHowever, a few issues intregrally related to bodybuilding require further scrutiny. Hereunder follows a list of a few of them together with their negative implications:\n\n1. Professional body building would require you to expose parts of your body that are considered private, e.g. thighs, etc.\n\n2. Excessive sleep is a cause of laziness, apathy and dullness of the mind.\n\n3. Bodybuilders are more susceptible to pride and arrogance. Qualities which are abhorred in the Shari’ah.\n\n4. Overeating – also a cause of laziness and is regarded as wastage. Allah does not lovewastefulness.\n\n5. Time – bodybuilding is very time consuming. A believer considers time to be invaluable and endervours to use it in an avenue that will yield optimum everlasting benefit in the hereafter.\n\nIn consideration of the above, we are of the opinion that the negative implications of bodybulding distinctly outweight its benefit. Furthermore, because the benefit of bodybuilding is only limited to yourself, we humbly encourage you to value your precious time and youth, which is the prime of your life, and apply it such that it will benefit you and the Ummah at large.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
