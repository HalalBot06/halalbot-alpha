  "answer": "QUESTION\nI want to know is it right that if wife is doing job and husband is unemployed and depend on her wife earning.  For husband it is halaal to use his wife income . please guide me\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nIt is the husbands responsibility to support his wife and fulfill her needs. The basic needs of the wife are food, shelter and clothing. If the husband is unemployed and he is unable to fulfill this marital obligations of supporting his wife, and the wife is compelled to work to maintain herself, the income will belong to her, and not to her husband.\n\nThe husband has no right over her income. The wife may assist her husband if she decides to. For that she will be rewarded. However, the wife assisting the husband should not lead the husband to be complacent in seeking an employment and supporting his wife.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\n \n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
