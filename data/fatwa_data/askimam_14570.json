Rasulullah (S.A.W) said, Shame is a big branch of Imaan. It will be against shame and modesty to explain the inner details of intimacy between the husband and wife. You are married and have been intimate with your wife. There is no special formula of pregnancy. The husband and wife adopt intimacy and intercourse as a means. The effect of the means is in the will of Allah. He decides who will get a child and when the person will get a child. Accordingly fertilisation takes place. Rasulullah (S.A.W) had children from Khadija (RA) and not from all the other wifeâ€™s. Allah gives us the incident of Ebrahim (AS) who had Ismaeel (AS) and Ishaq (AS) at old age. Zakariyya (AS) also got yahya (AS) at old age. Your are married only recently, make dua that if a child/ren are good for you and your Deen, Allah must grant you a child/ren. The decree of Allah is the best for every individual."
