  "question": "Is it permissible to take a shower while standing or one should take shower in sitting posture?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI want to ask about taking a shower in a standing position. Nowadays in bathrooms the shower is attached to the wall so normally the shower is taken by standing.

Whether it is permissible to take a shower while standing or one should take shower in sitting posture?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nIt is permissible to take a shower while standing.
