  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs this permissable? I would like to know if one is allowed to consume one or two glasses of alcohol. Is it written in the Holy Quaran that we are not allowed to consume and where in the Holy Quaran is it written since a friend of mine said that she read it somewhere that it is not forbidden for us to consume one or two glasses of alcohol. Is her readings about this correct?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala says in the noble Qur'aan, 'Oh you who believe! Intoxicants,\ngambling, dedication of stones and divination by arrows are an abomination\nof Shaytaan's work. So avoid it that you may prosper.' (Surah Maaidah Aayat\n90)\n\nThe prohibition of the consumption of alcohol is unrestricted in this Aayat\nof the noble Qur'aan. Hence, whether it be a drop or a gallon, it will be\nHaraam. Furthermore, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has mentioned\nin a Hadith, 'Any drink, whose large consumption intoxicates, even a little\nof it will be Haraam.'
