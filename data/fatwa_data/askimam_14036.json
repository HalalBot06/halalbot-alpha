  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI intend to set up a business soon could you please tell me what to read(wazifah)in order to be successful. Someone has told me to read Al jabbar as many  times as possible. Please advise.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nRecite ‘Yaa Wahhaabu, Yaa Waasi-u, Yaa Mughniy’ as much as possible. Obviously, you will have to obey all the other laws of the Shari’ah and abstain from sins to the best of your ability.\n\nDisobeying Allah and committing sins deprives one of barakah in one’s sustenance.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
