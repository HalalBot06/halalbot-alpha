  "question": "How and when Tayammum should be performed? When we are sick, and cannot get up from bed for even Tayammum, can Salaat be somehow performed lying down? Is there an example from the prophetâ€™s life?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person fears his sickness will increase or his cure will be delayed by\nusing water, then only he may make Tayammum. This could be done in even\nthough it be with the assistance of somebody.\n\nSalaat may be performed lying down only if one is unable to even sit and\nread the Salaat. This is done by lying on your back and placing a pillow\nbehind your head, thereby, facing towards the Qibla and raising the knee if\npossible. (Tahtaawi pg.234)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
