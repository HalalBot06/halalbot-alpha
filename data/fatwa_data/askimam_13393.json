  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a question pertaining to a non-muslim female friend of mine. Her mother died a few months ago and I felt very strongly for my friend. I could not help thinking how her mother will have gone to jahannum and how she will probably go to jahannum as well. In this time of sympathy, I told my friend that I would make du'aa that she and her family come onto the path of deen. I made the du'aa as promised but neither she nor any member of her family has embraced Islam as of yet. Am I now obliged to preach Islam to her? If so, how do I go about doing this?\n\n Jazaakamullahu khairun\n\n May Allah reward you and your fellow scholars for your good work. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nJazakallah for writing to the institute. May Allah Ta'ala in His infinite mercy reward you for the care and concern you have shown for a fellow human being's imaan. Since you have already given the message, now try to invite more by 'example'. That is, the way you conduct yourself. Also use appropriate moments to highlight the virtues and beauty of Islam.You can also make literature on Islam available to her. An English version of the Quran and books which may are explanatory and which will further arouse her interest.\n\nAsk her to join you when you have women's gatherings when deeni activity takes place in her area. If she has further questions, introduce her to a sister who is knowledgeable to answer her questions. You can also write in to this website for further help.\n\nDo not feel discouraged if she does not show any inclination to accept Islam. Hidayah is a gift which comes from Allah Ta'ala. You can only give the message. Allah Ta'ala is the one who changes the heart and steers the fortunate ones towards accepting the true religion. May Allah Ta'ala guide you and those whom you come into contact with, ameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nSister Fadila\nSOCIAL DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
