  "answer": "QUESTION\n3)is nikah on phone is allowed?what are the requirements for nikah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. After every Fardh Salaat, place the palm of the right hand on the%0D%0Aforehead and recite 11 times, 'Yaa Qayyoom'. Abstention from sins plays a%0D%0Avital role in the strengthening of the memory.%0D%0A2. Briefly, the Aayat manifests the status and honour of Nabi (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) and motivates the Muslims to love, obey and honour Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Therefore, we are ordered to send salutations%0D%0Ato Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) whose status and position is so high%0D%0Aand lofty that Allah Ta'ala and the angels also convey salaams in their own%0D%0Adistinctive way on the Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0AWhen attributed to Allah Ta'ala, salaam means descension of mercy, to the%0D%0Aangels it means supplication and to the Muslims, it means Du'aa and praises.%0D%0A3. Nikah by telephone will not be valid by the mere utterance of Iejaab%0D%0A(offer of contract) and Qubool (acceptance). However, if either party makes%0D%0Athe other their Wakeel (representative) by which the representative%0D%0A(opposite party) utters the Iejaab and Qubool in the presence of 2 witnesses%0D%0Awho are familiar with the bride, then the Nikah will be valid. However, if%0D%0Athey are not familiar with the bride, the Nikah will not be valid. (Jadeed%0D%0AFiqh Masaail pg.148)%0D%0AThe requirements for Nikah are: a) Both parties must be Muslim and both must%0D%0Abe of different genders, b) Both Iejaab and Qubool must take place in one%0D%0Aand the same sitting, c) Both the contracting parties, i.e. Wakeel, etc.%0D%0Amust be mature and must hear each other's word, d) Presence of two witnesses%0D%0A(male) free, mature and who witness the contract at the same time and place,%0D%0Ae) The contract should not be made temporary by fixing a specific period of%0D%0Avalidity, f) Mahr (dowry) should be stipulated.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
