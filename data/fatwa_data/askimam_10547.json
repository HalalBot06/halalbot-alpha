  "answer": "QUESTION\nassalamualaikum, i am hanaf i am going to hajj inshallah on 11th jan, which hajj is best suited for me, as i haveto stay for around15 days before hajj. jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to my understanding, you reside in Saudi Arabia. In principle, you can only perform Ifraad Hajj. You cannot perform Umrah in the months of Dhul-Hajj if you intend performing Hajj as that is only for an Afaqi (person residing outside Saudi Arabia).\n\nIn brief, you cannot perform Tamattu or Qiraan Hajj.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
