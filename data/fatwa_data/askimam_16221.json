  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nHow do u read qadha salaah? \nIs the wudhu broken if you have to visit the toile?\n\n\nIs your wudhu broken if you decide to eat a little snack between?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nShariah emphasizes on performing salat on time.  Nabi (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) said;\n\na.  “Do not neglect fard salat, intentionally, for Allah Ta’ala absolves himself from a person who neglects his fard salat intentionally”. Fadail A’mal Pg, 35-36 with reference to Ahmad. Zam Zam.)\n\nb.  “A person who misses one salat is like one who has lost his entire family and wealth”.    (Fazail Amal Pg 35-36 with reference to Ibn Hiban Ahmad Nisai. Zam Zam )\n\nc.  “A person who combines between two salats without any strong excuse reaches one of the doors of kabair (major sins)”. (Fazail Amal Pg 35-36 with reference to Hakim.)\n\nIf one misses salat he should make tawba (repentance) and make qada as soon as possible since there is no guarantee of life.\n\nA simple way of making qada is to read one or two qada salats with every fard salat performed. Qada is performed in the same manner as fard salat. However, there will be no qada of sunats whilst there is qada of witr.  Qada salat should not be performed in the forbidden times, namely, sunset, sunrise and midday (time of zenith).\n\nA person should calculate the number of salats missed and make qada. However if there are many and he can not remember how many he missed, he will continue making qada until his mind is content that he has no more qada salats due on him.\n\nOne’s intention will be e.g. “O Allah, I intend to perform (make qada) of the first or alternatively, (he can say can say the last) fajr salat I missed which was fard on me”. The intention for the next fajr salat (qada) will be the same, because this salat becomes the first (or last) salat he missed. (Likewise is the intention for all other qada salats )\n\n( Fatawa Mahmodia, Vol.7. pg. 364.Dar-Al-ifta. Jamia-Farokia-Karachi )\n( Hashiyatu Tahawi, Pg. 446. Dar Al-Kitab-Al-Alamiya )\n                                                                                                                   \n\n2.  As a rule, eating does not break wudhu.\n\n3.  Visiting the toilet does not break wudhu. Wudhu will break by urinating or passing stool.  (Bahishti Zewar, Vol. 1. pg. 54. Zam Zam)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
