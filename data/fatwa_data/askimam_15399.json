His Opinion was the forced divorce doesn't count as divorce in islam and he has given me following reference from :\n\n1. Fatwa from Shaykh Dr. Saalih Ibn Fowzaan Ibn 'Abdullaah Ibn Fowzaan.  He is a member of Permanent Committee for Islaamic Research and Fataawa,saudi arabia\n\nIn his book Al-Mulakhas Al Faqhi (no.14 vol- 2 page 388).\n\nI am quoting here a translation which states that.\n\nIf a person is forced by some to divorce and he if divorces by force with no other option, then this will not be counted as divorce as our beloved prophet Nabi Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) had said\n\náÇØáÇÞ æ áÇÚÊÇÞ Ýí ÇÛáÇÞ\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nwhich means \" No divorce counts in forced conditions\" this hadith has been recorded by Imam Ahmed,Imam Abu Dawood,and Imam Ibn Maja from AAISHAH (radhiallahu anha) {Sunnah Imam Abu Dawud (2193), Sunnah Imam Ibn Majah(2046)}\n\nFurther his quotes the holy quran reference,Surah An-nahl,first part of verse no 106.\n\nstates that \"Whoever disbelieved in Allâh after his belief, except him who is forced thereto and whose heart is at rest with Faith\"\n\nlastly he adds, as we all know khufar which is greatest sin and if Allah(SWT)can forgive khufar is forced conditions then definately divorce which accounts to lesser sin in comparsion khufar should be forgiven.\n\nPlease refer the original book in arabic version for more clarifiactions.\n\nAnother reference is\n\nMinhaz Al-Muslim ( Page 638-39) , By Abu Bakar Jabir Al-Jazayri ( Professor, Masjid – e – Nabvi, Al-Madina Al-Munwara – Saudi Arabia),it is transalted by Maulana Mohammed Rafiq Al-Asri \n\n \n\nYou can refer this book for clarification\n\n \n\nand third one i found from net is\n\n \n\nhttp://path-to-peace.com/community/showthread.php?t=2637\n\n \n\nIt is also saying same thing and also gives same reference hadith {Sunnah Imam Abu Dawud (2193), Sunnah Imam Ibn Majah(2046)}\n\n \n\n \n\nScholar's said questions 3 and 4 does not apply in this case as the divorce has not taken place as per islamic view.\n\nI am sharing this with you all as it is important to share knowledge which can be benifitical of all Ummah.\n\nPlease let me know if these opinions and fatwas are correct ?\n\nWe should all seek the forgiveness of Allaah, certainly, Allaah is ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful\n\nAllah knows the best\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n \n\nWe have stated in our response of Fatwa # 15271 that the verbal Talaaq of a Mukrah (forced person) is valid and binding.
