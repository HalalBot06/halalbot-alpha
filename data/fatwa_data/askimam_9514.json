  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a 45 years old infertile woman.The chances of having a baby is almost zero, according to the opinion of expert doctors. According to doctors I can go for IVF by donors egg. There are two options. A) Donor?s egg +my husband?s sperm. B) Donor?s embryo. Can we go for the second option, I think it is adopting or having some body?s else child from the very beginning. Please guide me accordingly if I am wrong. My husband Alhamdolilah is healthy and younger then me. I do not feel good. I do not want to give him this sacrifice for me; as he has right to have his own child. It will a ZULUM, what I do not want to do so. I am telling him to give me a divorce and to do a new marriage so he could have a child. I know it is the wording of Quran that a man cannot do equlibrium. That will be more than the pain of divorce. I red in Quran that when there is a divorce then Allah make them ?Bayniaz? with each other. I am at least hoping this mercy from Allah. On the other hand if my husband is going to have a complete family then I don?t want to be a thorn in front of all them. I am an educated person and doing job and take care of myself, rest of my life. But my husband does not want to listen for divorce or about the second marriage. I need your advise according to Quran, Sunnet and Shareyat. What should I do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for writing to the institute.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou would like to know about IVF by donor's egg, Second marriage and%0D%0Adivorce. The two options your doctor's have offered are not acceptable in%0D%0AIslam. Both methods involve the use of a non-mahram woman's ova being%0D%0Afertilised with your husband's sperm. A donor's embryo is not acceptable as%0D%0Ayou will not be the biological mother,(since your ova will not be fertilised%0D%0Awith your husband's sperm).%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is acceptable to adopt a baby whom you may be able to breast feed (your%0D%0Adoctors will tell you how your breastmilk can be produced with medication).%0D%0AThis will then mean that either a son%2Fdaughter will be mahram for both you %2F%0D%0Ayour husband and the child will become your foster child. From what you%0D%0Awrite, I get the impression that your husband does not mind that you cannot%0D%0Ahave a child. If he has accepted the situation and if he does not want to%0D%0Aremarry, why don't you accept the situation? There are lots of couples who%0D%0Ado not have children either because the man%2F woman do not meet with the%0D%0Arequired sperm%2Fovum criteria for producing a child. Try to accept this as a%0D%0Atest from Allah Ta'ala. This is not zulm from your side on your husband.%0D%0AYou are not in control of your body or your life. Allah Ta'ala had written%0D%0Athis as taqdeer for both of you as a couple. Your husband is to be admired%0D%0Afor his refusal to discard you just because you cannot have a child. It%0D%0Areveals a good character and sincerity on his behalf. You are a very%0D%0Afortunate woman and insha'allah both of you will reap the rewards in Jannah%0D%0Afor accepting Allah Ta'ala's will in this world.%0D%0A%0D%0AYes, you may feel at times that you are depriving your husband of a house%0D%0Afull of children etc. Both of you can still fill your lives with the%0D%0Alaughter and joy of children around you by volunteering to work with%0D%0Achildren. There are so many Muslim children who have been brought over to%0D%0Athe US from Bosnia, Afghanistan and many other 'Muslim' countries. There%0D%0Aalso children who are abandoned by their mothers or parents. Try to work%0D%0Awith these children and give them the love and care they are being deprived%0D%0Aof. You need to just contact agencies in your area to find out what services%0D%0Ayou can render for these children. Insha'allah you will find fulfillment in%0D%0Abringing joy to these children.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala's tests come in different forms to all of us. He is totally%0D%0Aaware of your desire to have children. The sabr you make and the devotion%0D%0Ayou and your husband show to each other are recognised by HIM.%0D%0A%0D%0APlease write if you need more clarification. May Allah Ta'ala grant you both%0D%0Agreater love, understanding and if HE wills, a child in your home to love%0D%0Aand comfort and cherish. May HE also make it easy for you to accept your%0D%0Asituation. Ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0ASister Fadila%0D%0ASOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
