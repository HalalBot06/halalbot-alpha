  "answer": "QUESTION\ni have a question about divorce i went to get the divorce papers from the office but they wouldnt give it to me unless i sign it. but the thing is i signed the papers so i could take it home.so i dont know if we r divorced.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYour question is not clear. We are not sure what you signed for. If you signed a document confirming you having taken the divorce papers, then that will not constitute divorce as merely taking the divorce papers is not issuing a divorce.\n\nIf you signed a document confirming that you issued your wife a divorce, then that will constitute a divorce.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
