  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI heard before that if someone commits sin that Allah (sw) allows us a few amount of time such as hours to repent before it is written down! is this true?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAbu Umamah (Radiallahu Anhu) narrates that (Nabi Sallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) is reported to have said; Verily the Angel at the left of a person (the Angel in charge of writing the sins of a person) withholds from writing his sinful deed committed for a period six hours. If (during this time) he regrets his sin and repents, the Angel then discards (does not write) his sin committed. (However if he does not regret his sin and repent) the Angel then records his sin committed.\n\nعن أبي أمامة عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم قال : إن صاحب الشمال ليرفع القلم ست ساعات عن العبد المسلم المخطئ أو المسيء فإن ندم واستغفر منها ألقاها وإلا كتبت واحدة\n\n \n\n(Majma’u Al-Zawaid, Vol.10, Pg. 207-208, Maktaba Al-Qudsi)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMl.
