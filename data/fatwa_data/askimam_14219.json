  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhy do I get depressed when I read your answers to various questions?\n\nWhy I do I feel an utmost discouragement and a complete failure as a Muslim without the will of perfecting myself when I read your answers to the questions?\n\nWhy do I feel like throwing all my efforts and my desire to increase my Emaan when I think back to the (sometimes) harsh and brutal doctrines and ways of my Islam as you claim them to be which I read on your website?\n\nEverytime I consult SunniPath (www.sunnipath.com) for example as an alternative for general knowledge and answers to various fiqh issues, I find that a much softer tone and an encouraging stance is adopted. And alhamdulillah, my sinful self actually finds the desire to repent when I read that my Allah is indeed merciful and He is indeed oft-forgiving by the attitude and manner in which the answers are structured in response to the concerns that are voiced from many Muslims whose issues are exactly like my own.\n\n\nYour answers affect me tremendously. Maybe this is a case of hypersensitivity and maybe questions and answers in these types of websites are not to be taken with the weight and influence as I place them. Greater chances are that I am entirely to be blamed.\nMaybe you send an entirely different response to the questioner, one that is much more complete and polite and I pray this is the case.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAt the outset we are extremely grateful for your mail. We always encourage constructive suggestions and are open to listen to those suggestions. It is through constructive suggestions that we will improve our services to the Ummah and make our work accessible to all spheres of the Ummah.\n\nNevertheless, Ulama are custodians of the Shariah. They have been blessed with the wealth of knowledge and they are responsible to guide the Ummah in every facet of their lives. The Ulama are committed to Shariah- the Laws of Allah and Sunnah of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. That is the Ulama will strive to uphold the Laws of Shariah even if they have to sacrifice their own lives. Imam Ahmed bin Hambal is an extraordinary example for us. He was prepared to be imprisoned than compromise on his commitment to laws of Shariah. In fulfilling this great responsibility, the Ulama undergo many tests from Allah. These tests appear in different forms. Sometimes these tests come in the form of choosing the pleasure of ones parents, wife and children or upholding the Law of Allah. The sign of a true Alim is that he is prepared to sacrifice anything to uphold the sanctity of Shariah whatever it may cost including his own life.\n\nIn this regard, we at the Darul Ifta are responsible to respond to the queries of the Ummah. In doing so, we are restricted by rules and principles of Shariah. We cannot issue rulings based on our wishes and desires. There are two aspects that have to be kept in mind when responding to a query. A) Presentation B) Contents\n\nThese two factors constitute a Fatwa/ruling. In terms of contents we are bound to refer to the books/rulings and guidance of our Illustrious Fuqahaa. However, the presentation is from our side. It is possible that we are hard in our presentation for which we apologise and will try to rectify.\n\nPresentations differ according to the temperament of the person answering and is also based on the manner the question has been asked. We will surely acknowledge your concern and will endeavour to respond in a polite and kind manner, Inshallah\n\nWe will appreciate if you point out to us your actual concern. Is the contents of our answers of concern to you or the presentation? If it is our presentation, then please point out some examples for our review and reformation.\n\nJazakallah\n\nAdministrator"
