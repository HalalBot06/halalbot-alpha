  "question": "I would like to know if I can pay off the interest of my mortgage with interest received from my savings account?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nInterest monies must be given to the poor and needy who are eligible to\naccept Zakaat without the intention of reward. However, interest received\nfrom government institutes, eg. post office could be used to offset\ngovernment taxes. Interest received from private banks cannot be used to\noffset taxes. It may be used to offset interest charged from the same bank.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
