  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. just  this month i  done circumcision to my son  his age  is 4 month. there is any restriction to having  sex with  my wife during this period .\n   it will effect the child health.\n\n2. after birth of child how regularly we can have sex , to maintain child health , my wife  health and my self .\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n1)      There is no restriction of being intimate with your wife after the circumcision of your son. This will not affect the health of the child in anyway.\n\n2)      After childbirth, women have nifaas (bleeding after childbirth). The termination of nifaas differs from individual to individual.  You may resume sexual relations with your wife after the termination of nifaas; not before that. This will not harm the health of your child in anyway.\n\n \n\nومنها حرمة الجماع هكذا في النهاية والكفاية وله أن يقبلها ويضاجعها ويستمتع بجميع بدنها ما خلا ما بين السرة والركبة عند أبي حنيفة وأبي يوسف\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
