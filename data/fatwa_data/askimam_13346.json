  "question": "Were the stars created to drive away Satans ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nHow do you interpret this verse in the Quran :\n\nWe have indeed decked the lower heaven with beauty (in) the stars,\n(for beauty) and for guard against all obstinate rebellious Satans.\n(So) they should not strain their ears in the direction of the Exalted Assembly but be cast away from every side.\n-- Sura 37:6-8\n\nWere the stars created to drive away Satans ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe stars were created to beautify the sky and are also used to drive away the inquisitive Shaytaan. They were not created solely to drive away the Shaytaan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
