  "question": "What rights does engagement confer on a fiance or fiancee?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShari'ah does not recognise contemporary forms of engagements where\nexorbitant amounts of monies is spent on the occasion. However, the\nangagement is a confirmation to marry. At that stage, theboy and girl are\nstill strangers to one another in that they cannot communicate with one\nanother.\n\nThe premarital outings after the engagement is strictly prohibited in Shari'\nah. Often, such engagements break up leaving a devastating effect on the\nparties and in particular, the 'used' fianc√©e.\n\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
