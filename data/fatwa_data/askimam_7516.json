  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) If someone breaks a nafil fast is kaffara necessary if a) the fast was breaken for no reason b) was broken with a valid reason i.e. being sick 2) Sometimes when I am keeping a nafil fast like the fast of Shawwal and someone offers food early in the day. I break the fast and keep it later. Is this bad?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In both instances (a and b), only Qadhaa and no Kaffaarah is necessary. (Tahtaawi pg.377)\n\n2. This act should be refrained from as it is Makrooh to do so. (Shaami vol.2 pg.328 - 329). Sayyiduna Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?When any of you are invited (for meals) he should attend, if is not fasting he should partake of the meals and if he is fasting he should make Du?aa for that person.?
