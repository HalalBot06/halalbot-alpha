  "question": "What is a Silsila?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is their status in Islam? Arent they a biddah when the Holy Prophet (s.a.s) or the salaf never were associated with any silsila (sufi order?) They also allow music, collective loud zhirk, biddahs etc? (some of them do)? How can be this Islamic and allowed? Who started them? My friend says this orignated from Christians (baptism)?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA Silsila is the chain or order of Sufis that leads eventually to Nabi\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nBasically, there are four famous chains, i.e. Chistiyya, Naqshabandiyya,\nQaadriyya and Suharwadiyyah and these are accepted as authentic and correct.\nJust like the four Madhabs, many pious predecessors and Ulama associated and\npleged allegiance to the practices of these orders which are generally based\non Qur'aan and Hadith.\n\nMusic is definitely not allowed by them and they do not originate from the\nChristians.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
