  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer below our standard reply to similar queries.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AMuslim males should not wear ear rings at all. Wearing ear rings is%0D%0Aforbidden for Muslim males for two reasons:%0D%0A%0D%0AFirstly, wearing ear rings has been generally a female custom and Muslim%0D%0Amales should not imitate the females in their dress, walk and talk, just as%0D%0AMuslim females should not imitate the males. The Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) cursed those men who imitate women and those women who imitate%0D%0Amen. (Bukhari; Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0ASecondly, the men who wear ear rings are generally people with queer%0D%0Acharacter. They are mostly homosexuals and morally perverse people. Muslims%0D%0Ashould try to resemble good, pious and righteous people. We must inform our%0D%0Ayouth who may become attracted to wear earrings that this is against the%0D%0Ateachings of Islam. We should pay more attention to our youth so that they%0D%0Ado not get involved in un-Islamic groups and immoral lifestyles. The youth%0D%0Amay receive such evil influences if they are neglected at home and their%0D%0Aparents do not provide them proper Islamic alternatives.%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
