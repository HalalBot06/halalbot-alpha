  "answer": "QUESTION\nI'm 21 yrs female, i notice some discharge when my husband comes closer to me and intimates me, though our private parts will not get in contact with each other and we'll not have intecourse.So please tell me whether i need to perform ghusul in this situation\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe discharge could either be Mazi or Mani. Mazi breaks Wudhu only and Mani breaks Ghusl. Mazi emits when one is aroused and Mani emits when one reaches climax and orgasm.\n\nOne differentiating feature between Mazi and Mani is after the emission of Mazi, the excitement remains and one is not fulfilled. In the emission of Mani, one is fulfilled and there is no more sexual excitement.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
