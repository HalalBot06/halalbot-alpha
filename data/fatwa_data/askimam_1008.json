  "question": "Salaam, I would like to know what is the ruling on a married muslim woman dyeing her hair to cover grey hair. Was salaam Jazakullah khairun",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPure black dye is not permissible. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, \"There will be people who will come later (in my Ummah) and apply black dye. They will not even smell the fragrance of paradise.\" (Abu Daawood). However, it is permissible for a Mujaahid (warrior) to apply black dye in order to give the impression of being young. (Jawahirul Fiqh vol2 pg421)\n\nTo dye the hair any other colour besides black e.g. Mehndi or Katm (type of grass) is permissible. This was the practice of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) and the Sahaaba (Radhiyallaahu Ánhum). (Jawahirul Fiqh vol2 pg421)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
