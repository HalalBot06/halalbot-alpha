  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs salaamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu\n\nDear respected brother in Islam\n\nSufism is an integral part of shariah. It is a way of attaining the\nrecognition of Allah Ta'ala and gaining His proximity. That can be achieved\nonly by stictly adhering to the laws of shariah as shown to us by our beloved\nprophet Mohammad (sallalahu alaihi wa sallam) Any act contrary to shariah,\nfor example music etc. can never be part of sufism.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E.
