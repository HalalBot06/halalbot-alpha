  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nA salaam walaykum I have had a dream about a mouse. This is my second time dreaming about it. The dream isn't clear but i remember a white mouse in the dream. I read an interpretation of it on an Islamic website and it said something about a Curropt and sinful woman. I am so scared I don't know what I did wrong. I'm only 19 and I'm staying focused with religion, family and education. And I still had this dream. Could you please help me? Is it something I have done Wrong? Jazakallah Fatiah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:"
