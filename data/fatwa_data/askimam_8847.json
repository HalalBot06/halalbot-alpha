  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy friend is getting married soon. She wants her friends to throw her a bridal shower. Also she is having a mehdi party for ladies with a belly-dancer. The wedding is in a Church hall with the guests sitting mixed. I have tried telling my friend and her parents, but as she is the last daughter to get married, no expense is being spared. My brother does not want me to have anything to do with this, as he says it is haraam, a waste of money and the is no barakat or good to come out of this. The groom has told my brother that he won't work, will be supported by his in-laws. They must provide house, car, food etc. The in-laws don't know this. What must I do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour brother is correct in advising you.\n\nAccording to the details of the proposed marriage, the bridal shower, belly\ndancing, having the wedding at the church, extravagance, etc. are all Haraam\nacts which incurs the wrath and anger of Allah. It is not permissible for\nanyone to attend such a wedding. Whosoever attends such a wedding is guilty\nof contributing to the evils of wedding and will be sinful.\n\nIt is sad and unfortunate that a Nikah supposed to be an act of Ibaadah\nwhich invokes the mercy of Allah, but people have chosen to imitate the\nKuffaar style of life in weddings and depriving themselves of the mercy of\nAllah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
