  "question": "get my bleeding after every 18 days, but yellow discharge whenever. Also after bleeding I experience light brownish discharge for about 2-3 days.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nRegarding Fatwa # 13594, I am very mixed up, and confused.\n\nIf I carry on calculating my days of Haidh in this manner, soon all 7 day days of bleeding will fall on my days of purity, will I then have to pray and fast on those days considering it as Istihadha, even though I experience menstrual cramps, etc. during that time?\n\nPs. I get my bleeding after every 18 days, but yellow discharge whenever. Also after bleeding I experience light brownish discharge for about 2-3 days.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf the yellowish discharge at the beginning or end of your bleeding days, regard the discharge also as blood. However, if the discharge is during other times, regard it as Istihaadha.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
