  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am suggested to wear on two stones in a silver ring for my well being by an astrologist. I just want to confirm whether its allowed in Islam or not.Kindly revert back at the earliest and\n\nÂ \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is not permissible to consult an astrologist regarding ones future. You should repent from that and place your trust in Allah regarding your life. If there is a need to seek advice, consult an Aalim who is known for his taqwa and piety. You should not wear the ring suggested by the astrologist.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
