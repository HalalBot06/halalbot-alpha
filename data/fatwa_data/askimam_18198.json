  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question is a short one. I am a 18 year old University of Toronto Student. My family goes to Maple Lodge Farms and we buy the Zabiha Hala chicken that comes in a box ( greater quantity). We have been doing this for a while now since it is an excellent deal. The halal meat is extra cost but it is still economical. I have been doing some readings and some Imams declare it halal for the food to be cut by machine but others insist in only hand slaughtered. I know there is a big controversey going on about this topic. I would like to know if what we are buying is halal. Jazakallah khar for your time.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nÂ \n\nWe are based in South Africa and cannot comment on the Halal status of chicken sold in Canada.
