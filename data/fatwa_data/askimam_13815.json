  "question": "Is it forbidden for a Hanafiyyah to raise hands when going to ruku en when coming back from ruku and etc.. in salah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it forbidden for a Hanafiyyah to raise hands when going to ruku en when coming back from ruku and etc.. in salah?\n\n My conclusion is that because there are hadeeth negating and hadeeth affirming it it should be aloud to use both, so do it sometimes and leave it out sometimes in accordance to call it SUNNAH GHAYR MUAKKADA.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are two types of Hadith regarding Raf-ul-Yadayn. Both are correct. The issue is of what is Afzal and more virtuous.\n\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, not to make Raf-ul-yadayn is more virtuous. It is advisable to carry out only one practice as different practices may also lead to confusion among people.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
