  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni want to know about ...\n1. kiya har banda ALLAH ka walii ban sakta hay ??? and what we do for this effort??? {Can anyone become a Wali Of Allah?}\n\n2. and is it allow in islam to do job in pizza hut where we make pizza with HAM meat and all the HARAM meat.....even u can;t offer ur prayers there??\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1)\n\nIt is possible for every servant of Allah to become a wali.  In fact, a small amount of wilayyat is found in each Muslim.  Allah Ta’ala says in the Qur’an:\n\nإِنَّ أَوْلَى النَّاسِ بِإِبْرَاهِيمَ لَلَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُ وَهَذَا النَّبِيُّ وَالَّذِينَ آَمَنُوا وَاللَّهُ وَلِيُّ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n\nVerily those closest to Ibrahim (Alaihi al-Salam) are the ones who followed him and this Nabi, as well as those who have Imaan.  And Allah is the friend of the Believers.\n\nTherefore, some degree of waliyat is found in every believer, which is due to the Imaan we have in our hearts.  Nevertheless a Muslim should try to become a wali in the true sense.  The doors of prophethood are closed, the doors of become a Sahabi are closed, but the doors of wilayat are not closed.  If a person desires to become a wali and exhorts himself, then the help of Allah will be with him to assist him in his goals. Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim both narrate in their Sahih:\n\nعن أبى هريرة رضى الله عنه قال قال النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول الله تعالى أنا عند ظن عبدى بى ، وأنا معه إذا ذكرنى ، فإن ذكرنى فى نفسه ذكرته فى نفسى ، وإن ذكرنى فى ملأ ذكرته فى ملأ خير منهم ، وإن تقرب إلى بشبر تقربت إليه ذراعا ، وإن تقرب إلى ذراعا تقربت إليه باعا ، وإن أتانى يمشى أتيته هرولة (متفق عليه)\n\nAbu Huraira Narrate that Nabi (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) said, “Allah Ta’ala says, ‘I am in relation with my slaves in accordance to their view regarding me.  And I am with him when he remembers me.  If he remembers me in his heart, I remember him in my heart.  And if he remembers me in a gathering, I remember him in a better gathering.  And if he comes close to me a hand span, I come closer to him an arms length.  If he comes closes to me an arms length, I come closer to him two arms length.  If he comes to me walking, I come to him running. (Bukhari & Muslim)\n\nThere are many different methods of getting close to Allah Ta’ala.  The Ulama state that even if a person does only the obligatory act, but abstains from all types of sin, whether major or minor, inshallah he will become a wali of Allah.\n\nOne should take bay’ah to an experienced sheikh whose practices are according to the sunnah of the Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) and refrains from all forms of bid’ah.  Someone who can guide him toward the path of wilayat and help him overcome obstacles which might be a hindrance in the path.  May Allah make it easy for us to be from those servants whom Allah is pleased with, Ameen.\n\n2)\n\nIt is not permissible to work in a restaurant where haram food is served.  However, if a person cannot find an alternative job and is financial in need of this job, then he should not quit this work, but instead continue to work while looking for another job.\n\nIt is not permissible to take up such a job in which your salah is made qadha.  Salah is one of the foremost commandments of Allah.  To miss a salah is a grave sin.   In a hadith it is reported:\n\nعن ابن عباس قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم من جمع بين الصلاتين من غير عذر فقد أتى بابا من أبواب الكبائر (الحاكم فى المستدرك)\n\nIbn Abbas (Radhiyallahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) has said, “A person who combines two salahs without any strong excuse reaches one of the doors of ‘Kabair’ (major sins) – Hakim in al-Mustadrak\n\nOne should request the supervisor/manager for permission to be excused for a few minutes so that he may offer the prayers.  Offering the fardh prayers is not so time consuming and one may also pray the bare minimum in such circumstances which is better than not offering the prayers at all.  If the company does not allow in this then to work at such places is not permissible.  One should look for a job in which he may offer his prayers.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
