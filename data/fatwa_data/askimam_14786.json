  "answer": "QUESTION\nI received the following email, is this autnentic or is it false?Thank you.\nNamaaz-e-Qazaa-e-Umr\n\nHazrat Amir-ul-Mo'mineeen (A.S.) said that any person who has\naccumulated a lot of qazaa namaaz (missed a lot of salaats) and does\nnot have the strength to offer them should offer Namaaz-e-Qazaa-e-Umr.  \nThis namaaz is the kaffara to cover 700 years of qazaa namaaz. One\nperson asked Wali-Ullah \"but the people of the ummat of Nabi live\nonly 70-100 years at the most?\" Hazrat Ali (A.S.) replied that the\nnamaaz-e-kaffara covers your whole life's qazaa namaaz, your\nparents, your grand parents, your great grand parents and others\ngoing back up to 700 years qazaa namaaz. \nWhen to pray: \nOn the last Friday of the month of Ramadhan before sunset. \n How to pray: \nIt's a 4 rakaat namaaz with one salaam. In every rakaat recite\nsura-e-fateha (Alhamd) once; followed by Sura-e-Ahad (Qulahwallah)\n25 times; followed by Ayatul-kudsi once and followed by Sura-e-Kauthar 15 times. \nThe Holy Qur'an says: \"If someone trusts Allah, he will suffice him.\nHe will surely bring about what he decrees. Allah has set measure\nfor everything\". (Surah Al-Talaq, 65:3) \n \nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe contents of the email are not authentic. It is fabrication. There is no basis for the Namaaz e Qaza Umr as stated in the email.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
