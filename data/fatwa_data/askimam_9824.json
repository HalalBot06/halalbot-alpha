  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. A woman has a period for 7 days then for 3 days there is no blood, then for 7 days she has her period then nothing for 3 days and again then her period starts again for 7 days and nothing for 3 days. So in one month she has a period 3 times altogether. Could youplease explain when her real period is from these and when is considered to be clean and can pray etc? 2. Some people say that if a dog (wet part) touches your clothes then the same rule applies if it licks a vessel, i.e. that you must wash them 7 times one of those times being with soil. Is this true? IF it is then what if in the past one washed the clothes normally with water just once, does that mean they are still impure and has there touching other items made them impure aswell? 3. If the husband follows one opinion for salah and the wife follows another does she have to follow the opinion he follows if he asks her to (e.g when praying in jamaat) or can she stick to her own opinion? Does she have to follow his opinion in other issues if he differs with her, or can he only expect her to do this in issues that concern them both and not those which are her personal ibadah issues?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe woman should adopt a 22 day cycle. The first seven days will be haydh\n(menses), the next fifteen days will be Tuhr. The bleeding inbetween from\nthe 11th till the 17th will be Istihaadha. She should wash and make Wudhu\nfor every Salaat.\n\nHer Wudhu will be valid for the entire time of one Salaat. Her next haydh\nwill be on the 23, the 16th day after her first haydh terminated on the\nseventh day.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
