  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI shall be a brief as possible, Insha''allah. I am posting this for  two reasons to !.  1.To get  Your  answer 2. and to enlighten others to the danger of the internet.\n\nThree years ago I accepted marraige Proposal via internet live talk to a Muslim  from Pakistan. As of this wrting we are still commnication  very often and as of yet I  am still not married and He declines to  set a date each time I bring it up, his reply is \"  have Sabr for Ske of Allah (wa ta' ala) \". I have  told him this is wrong and incorrect and forbidden in Islam to continue on with this relationship. I have not been able to end it  due to attachment and  hope that all His excuses and reasons are valid and Insha'alah in time all will be ok.\n\nI now realize this is not the case and  unfortunately I have come to care deeply for this Muslim, but I know now that I  must end it and I do not  know how to do it Islamically and request  Your advice. I have  quoted Him so much Sunnah/Qur'an but all He says is  yes! this is correct, take  Sabr and trust Allah(SWT), and Insha'allah all is Khair. He well educated and has  lived in Saudi for many years ,I consider  Him most knwledgeable of Islam, however I sense He is delaying  for  reasons unknown to Me and perhaps He is just passing My time, without Ninyah of Nika at all. Please advise correct way (islamically to handle this). I have tried but he seems to igonor my please and I am not a rude or impolite person. I embraced Islam 7 years ago. \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh.  \n\nIt is not permissible for you to communicate with the man you are proposed to. He is not yet your husband. You should immediately stop communicating with him. Initially, it would be difficult due to the attachment you have for him, however, take courage and stop communicating with him. This is the decree of Shari’ah and should be adhered to with good spirit.\n\nHe should be referred to your father or some senior of your family.\n\nIf he is sincere in his intentions to marry you, he will refer to your father or a senior of your family, fix a date and not delay the marriage. Do not be deceived by his words ‘take Sabr’, ‘trust Allāh’. According to Shari’ah, he is not allowed to communicate with you. You should stop all communications with him and continue your normal life.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
