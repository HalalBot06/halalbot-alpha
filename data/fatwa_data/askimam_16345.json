The smallest benefit is it removes illness and the greatest benefit is it reminds one of Shahada at the time of death. The best miswak is that of the Arak and then that of the olive. The method of using the miswak is one should use it horizontally. If a miswak is not available one could use his finger. If a female is unable to use a miswak she could suffice on chewing on it.\n\nحاشية رد المحتار - (ج 1 / ص115)\n\nThe procedure of ghusl (bath) is to begin by washing the hands, then to wash the private parts. Thereafter wash any impurity on the body, then make a complete wudhu (ablution) and finally to end by passing water over the entire body thrice.\nحاشية رد المحتار - (ج 1 / ص157)\n\nIt is be permissible to recite duas in a situation where the bathroom and toilet is together if there is no visible impurity.  \n\nA bath (ghusl) refers to washing the entire body whereas ablution refers to washing certain organs only.\n\nIn taking a bath, it is not a condition to make niyyah. If one makes a niyyah, for example my body has a right over me which I am fulfilling, then he would be rewarded accordingly.\n\nWhile taking a jananba bath, one will make ablution after washing hands, then wash all impurities which may be on the body.\n\nWhilst taking a bath one should also make ablution. However, if he did not do so then a mere bath will suffice for validating salah if the organs which ought to be washed in ablution are washed.\n\nIn a closed bathroom too, one should not face qibla direction.\n\nWhilst showering, one should not recite the duas verbally.\n\nWhilst in the toilet, if Quranic verses involuntarily comes to ones mind then there is no problem with this.\n\nOne may use an Asian or Indian type closet but should ensure no slashes splash on his clothes or body.\n\nIt is mandoob (preferable) to use a sandal and cover ones head when in the closet.\n\nWhilst cleaning ones self, using the hands are sufficient.\n\nGhusl becomes compulsory on the meeting of the private organs.\n\nAll the above is based on the Hanafi madhab. For Shafi’e rulings you should refer to a Shafi’e scholar.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Ishaq E. Moosa,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
