  "question": "A man has given divorce to her wife twice in sitting, and once again after a year, this time again twice in a sitting. Is she divorced?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nA man has given divorce to her wife twice in sitting, and once again after a year, this time again twice in a sitting. Now he says he did not mean that. He did not know the ruling of shari'ah about divorce. He says he was never told about implementation of divorce in that way, as he is American-born, and knows very little about Islam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen a man gives his wife (conceived or not) three Talaaqs (verbally or in\nwriting) it is classified as Talaaq Mughallazah (literally meaning three\nTalaaqs; whether these Talaaqs were issued in one sitting or on different\noccasions), they are still valid and regarded as three. They cannot live\ntogether as husband and wife.\n\nIgnorance of the law is no excuse.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
