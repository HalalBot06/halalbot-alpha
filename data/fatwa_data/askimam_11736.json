  "answer": "QUESTION\ndo you beleive that muslims today have tenedicies like christains ?. as in that they believe that Isa(as) died for they're sins and that they can do what they like as all is forgiven. Muslims today i believe are relying on the fact that the Prophet (SAW) will intercede for us to Allah (SWT) and that it is alright that we sin as we will all eventually be in heaven inshallah. Jazakallah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe fact of the matter is that your perceptions of this situation is%0D%0Aincorrect. Christians believe that Eesa [Alayhis salaam] crucifiction was%0D%0Athe ultimate sacrifice to absolve man of sin which is his necessary%0D%0Aattribute. Without this sacrifice, man could not be released from the%0D%0Aboundage of sin. Without his intercession, there is no hope of salvation.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Muslim's perception of Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] is%0D%0Aentirely different. Firstly, Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] did%0D%0Anot have to be killed for his intercession to be accepted. Secondly, Allah%0D%0ATa'ala will forgive and admit many people into Jannah without Rasulullah's%0D%0A[Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam] intercession. Thirdly, there are certain sins%0D%0Aso severe that Rasulullah [Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam] has stated that the%0D%0Aperpetrators of these will be deprived of my intercession. Christians on the%0D%0Aother hand believe that whoever brings faith in Eesa as their saviour, will%0D%0Again salvation. Thus, Muslims cannot do whatever they wish and still they%0D%0Awill gain the intercession of Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam].%0D%0ABesides this, there are many other differences which if you would attempt to%0D%0Aresearch would become apparent to you.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
