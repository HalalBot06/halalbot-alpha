  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nJazakallah Khair for all the amazing work you and your organization has been doing for all the Muslims throughout the world. I am personally greatful to you Mufti Sahab and your Ulema Hazraath for answering a couple of my questions earlier.Below are 3 questions that are bothering me. I would greatful if you could shed some light.\n\nI have US $17,000 in Credit Card debts for which I have been paying minimum monthly repayments which are interest based. I started using credit cards when I wasn’t aware about the sharii warnings of interest based transactions, now by the barakath of Tableegh, I have stopped using the cards for almost a year and I just want to get rid of the debt. The reason behind me paying only minimum monthly payments is that I work as a contractor, my work is a project based work, sometimes I don’t have work for months (4 months now) so when I have work I save some money for these difficult times so that I can carry on with my minimum monthly livelihood expenditure. Last year I got married and my wife doesn’t work, Alhamdulillah, she has about US $ 15,000 worth of gold jewelry that she got in her wedding …now as ramadhan is fast approaching what will be the zakat we will have to pay say for example if we have X amount of dollars in bank as savings from my work that finished 4 months ago and Inshallah with some money from my new work assignment. I also have a car which I use for my personal use worth about $ 4,090.\n\n \n\nI had made an intention of naming our new born child, if a boy, by the name of first caliph (R.A) of Islam, Abu Bakr ,but later on found out that Abu Bakr’s (R.A) real name was Abdullah (correct me if I am wrong) please suggest what should I name the baby. Also if a baby girl is born I thought of naming her Zainab by the name of Zainab (R.A, daughter of Nabi (P.B.U.H)) please comment.\nAlhamdulillah i am involved with the work of Tableegh over here for the past 3 years or so. Nowadays i am in some sort of confusion as i am more worried about the shortcomings and sins of others rather than looking at myself. I get thoughts in my mind and heart about what and how people are sinning. Please guide me how to rectify this situation.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nAlhamdulillah, it is pleasing to hear that you are benefitting much from Q&A. May Allah Ta’ala accept these humble efforts and grant us the strength and ability to continue. Ameen.\n\n \n\nIt is also pleasant to hear that you have given up dealing in interest. May Allah Ta’ala accept and make it easy for you. Ameen.\n\n \n\nYou should continuously recite the following dua:\n\n \n\nاللَّهُمَّ اكْفِنِي بِحَلَالِكَ عَنْ حَرَامِكَ وَأَغْنِنِي بِفَضْلِكَ عَمَّنْ سِوَاكَ\n\nInsha Allah, Allah Ta’ala will make it easy to pay all your debts.\n\n \n\n1.                  We advise that you try to get a loan from a family member or friend and pay off all interest based amounts. You could ask your spouse to borrow you her jewelry, sell them and pay of your debts. Thereafter, you could pay back what you borrowed. In this way you will be getting yourself completely out of all interest bearing loans. Jewelry and other wedding gifts to a woman are of sentimental value. When approaching your wife you should be sensitive to her feelings. Do not impose on her to give you her jewelry.\n\n \n\nYou should continue to make dua to Allah Ta’ala and ask his repentance.\n\n \n\nWith regards to your first question, firstly it is important to note that each person will give zakah on his wealth and belongings separately. Therefore, in calculating your zakah you will not count your wife’s jewelry and other belongings. She will pay her zakah individually from you.\n\n \n\nCalculating zakah is simple. All you need to do is add the amount of cash at hand, stock of trade (in any), debt receivable and amount of gold and silver. Thereafter, you minus any debts payable. 2.5% of the total will be your zakah payable.\n\n \n\n \n\nExample of Calculating Zakah\n\n\n\n\nCash\n\n\t\n\nR10 000\n\n\n\n\nStock\n\n\t\n\nR10 000\n\n\n\n\nDebts Receivable\n\n\t\n\nR10 000\n\n\n\n\nJewelry (Gold, Silver)\n\n\t\n\nR10 000\n\n\n\n\nOther Zakatable Items\n\n\t\n\nR10 000\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\t\n\nR50 000\n\n\n\n\nDebts Payable\n\n\t\n\nR10 000\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\t\n\nR40 000\n\n\n\n\nX 2.5%\n\n\t\n\nR1000\n\n \n\nBasic necessities are not zakatable therefore; there is no zakah on your vehicle.\n\n \n\n \n\n2.                  Nabi صلى الله عليه وسلمadvised to keep good names as the name has an effect on a person and on the day of Judgment we will be called by our names together with the name of our fathers.\n\n \n\nThe name of the first caliph was Abdullah. Some say he name was Ateeq however, the correct view is that this was his nickname. He was also known as Abu Bakr.\n\n \n\nAbu Bakr, Abdullah, Zainab are all good names. Any name would be appropriate. You should also consult with the mother of the child to be when choosing a name.\n\n \n\n3.               Looking at the sin taking place and worrying how everyone can come back onto Din is something praiseworthy. It is a sign of a person’s Iman. However, this should not create a “holier than thou” attitude. You should also reflect on your shortcomings. Never look down upon anyone.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl. Ishaq E. Moosa,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
