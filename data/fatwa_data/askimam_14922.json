  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nWill hafiz get more reward for offering namaz and will he recieve more punishment for missing his prayer than a person who is haafiz but knows eveything about importance of prayer?\n\n    \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nOffering Salaah is equally important for a hafiz and a non hafiz.  The punishments for missing prayers are the same for everyone.  However, the amount of reward a person receives depends on us.  Things which increase the reward are: intentions; performing all Faraaidh, Waajibaat, Sunnah’s and Mustahibaat’s; praying with humility, sincerity, concentration, tranquility, khushoo and khudoo etc. \n\n \nReference:\n\nTuhfa Khawaateen pg.111\nHeavenly Ornaments, Chapter of Salaah\n\n \nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nA Female Iftaa Student\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
