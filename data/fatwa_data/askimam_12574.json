  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow did Rasoolulullah (SAW) and the Sahabah carry out wedding festivals (i.e. Waleemah)? Is there any mention in any of the books of hadith or aathaar of how the the waleemah was carried out ? was any of the general laws of Islam bent at all e.g. was music permitted, was there strict segregation etc? Nowadays the bride is dressed up for everybody to see ? even non-Mahrams such as her brother in laws ? is this OK? Jazakumullahu Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is totally impermissible for non-Mahrams to view the bride or bridegroom. These are the evil practices that are encouraged by Shaytaan.\n\nMusic is also prohibited on all occasions with no exception. We definitely haven?t located any such tradition that justifies such sinful deeds. At the time of marriage, people should be more conscious of the commands of Allah and the Sunnah of Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam], with the hope that Almighty Allah grants blessing and prosperity to the marriage. How could one expect such blessing after flouting the injunctions of Shari?ah in the wedding ceremony.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH SCIENCES\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
