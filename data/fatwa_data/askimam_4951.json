  "question": "Shaving & cutting hair?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nFor how many days before Ei can u not cut or shave hair? Why?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ: Is it prohibited to cut one's hair in the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah?%0D%0AA: It is Mustahabb (commendable) for a person making Qurbaani not to cut the%0D%0Ahair and finger nails from the 1st of Zul Hijjah until after slaughtering%0D%0Athe Qurbaani animal. To observe this Mustahabb act is greatly rewarding.%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said 'In lieu of every limb and%0D%0Apart of the animal, the person's limbs and parts of his body will be freed%0D%0Afrom Jahannam (Abu Dawood). Therefore, a person should try as much as%0D%0Apossible to leave his hair and nails uncut in these ten days so that they%0D%0Amay be freed in lieu of the nails and hair of the sacrificed animals.%0D%0AHowever, if the hair under the arms and in the pubic region is very long%0D%0A(which renders the Salaat Makrooh i.e. more than forty days), then it will%0D%0Abecome compulsory to remove such hair. However, if a person forgets to clip%0D%0Athe nails before the 1st of Dhul Hijjah and the nails have grown so long%0D%0Athat they may cause injury, then he may clip them.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0Afor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
