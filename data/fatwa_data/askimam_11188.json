  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) what are the proper steps to prevent a perfectly healthy person from praying sitting, as in, what can one say to them? (2) what do does seeing monkies in a dream mean? What about other animals such as crocodiles, dogs, and snakes? (3) I have seen Prophet Mohammed and his Daughter Fatima, separately, in dreams before, what does that mean? Thanks for your help and May Allah bless you for your work. Ameen.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Qiyaam (the standing posture) in Salaat is Fardh. If a person has the ability to stand and perform Salaat, he cannot sit and perform Salaat. If he sits and performs Salaat, his Salaat will be invalid as he has missed out a Fardh act of Salaat. If a person is sitting and performing Salaat without any valid Shar?ee reason, he should be advised of the consequences of his act with wisdom. The purpose of advising in the Shari?ah is not only to inform but to make a person practise. It is, therefore, important to consider the person, his temperament and circumstances before advising him on the correct Shar?ee ruling of standing and performing Salaat. It is also advisable that an Aalim be requested to advise the person.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Generally, a donkey in one?s dream resembles one?s defeated enemy. A crocodile resembles a crafty thief. A dog resembles an enemy who will become one?s friend. Snakes generally resembles one?s enemies.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Thank Allah for such Mubaarak dreams. Recite salawaat (Durood) abundantly to Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] and adhere to the Sunnah of Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam]%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
