  "question": "Is it true that Woman has been created from the CURVED Rib of Man, and hence the nature?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen Nabi Aadam (Alayhis salaam) was created, he was lonely. Allah created his spouse Hawaa (Alayhis salaam) from his left rib.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe various creations of Allah Ta?ala have been created from different matter, the matter also has an effect in the nature of these creations. For example, Jinn have been created from fire, which has the quality of rising. Thus, Jinn generally have the quality of pride. Man has been created from sad, which has the quality of being low. Thus man is humble by nature.%0D%0A%0D%0AWomen, having been created from a rib and have a degree of imbalance in their nature. The Ahaadith give a few examples of this imbalanced nature of women. Women have a common trait of being ungrateful of their husband, and of being hasty in cursing those that hurt their feelings. Again, this does not mean that all women are ungrateful, but that should not willfully make an effort to be grateful, the quality of ungratefulness will manifest itself.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe husband is advised that in view of the wife?s imbalanced nature, he should be patient and accept her as she is. He should not expect to completely correct her. If the husband does not have patience, and expects the wife to be perfect, there will be much turmoil in the home, to the extent that it will eventually lead in the marriage breaking down. This has been repeatedly confirmed through experience.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
