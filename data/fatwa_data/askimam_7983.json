  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it true that under an Islamic state a non-Muslim is not allowed to testify against a Muslim? If this is so then what happens when the only witness to a crime by a Muslim is a non-Muslim? Also could you give a proof/reference to your answer eg Hadith etc.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not true that a non-Muslim cannot testify against a Muslim in an Islamic state.\n\nA Jew had defended a claim of an armour against Hadhrat Ali (radhiallaahu anhu) during his reign of Khilaafat. The judge, Shurah, had issued the decree in favour of the Jew against Hadhrat Ali (radhiallaahu anhu) as he did not support his claim with Shar?ee evidence.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
