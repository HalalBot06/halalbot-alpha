  "question": "I gave a loan when i got engaged",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI gave a loan of a large sum of money to my fiance before we beacme engaged. Personally I am not in a rush to ask for it back until I need it, however Islamically does the amount have to be paid back to me before Nikah takes place, would it affect Mahr or anything if he owes me a substantial amount  already?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThe loan is different from the Mehr. When you marry, your husband will have to offer you Mehr. That will have nothing to do with the amount he owes you in lieu of the loan.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
