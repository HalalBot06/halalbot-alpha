Until you do not perform a Nikah with her, she is not considered your wife and hence you cannot have any relation with her. Your relation with her even though not being physical is also considered as Zina (fornication). Rasulullah ( sallallahu alayhi wasallam ) said “The eyes also commit Zina, the hands also commit Zina and the feet also commit Zina”. Therefore you should sincerely repent to Allah for your wrongs and make a determination never to repeat the same.\n\nYou state that you have caught her in another relationship. It is your choice to marry a woman with these morals and values. You also state that she has apologized for the first encounter and now has a second relation. It seems that she has a habit of such behaviour. If she has inherited this behaviour due to your Haraam relation with her, you are responsible for that and will have to bear the sin of her evil as well.\n\nYou may liaise with her family and inform them regarding her actions. You may also advise them to remind her of death, life after death and accountability in the Court of Allah for our wrong doings. Perhaps she may take heed and mend her ways and make Tawbah and be remorseful over her past.  \n\nAccording to Shariah, your Nikah will be valid with her bearing in mind her past. If you had identified her as a suitable wife for you, you should have informed your parents and made the necessary arrangements for marriage and at least perform the Nikah. This would stop her from falling into Haraam. Nevertheless, if you still want to marry her, you must immediately think of ways to proceed with the marriage and avoid further complications.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
