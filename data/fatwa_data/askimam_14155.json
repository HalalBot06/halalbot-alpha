  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was married about 2 years ago. My wife has developed a skin problem called  vitiligo. This happened just 4/5 months after marriage. My parents think that my wife's family hided this issue from us. On the other hand my wife's family denying this and argue that this is a natural cause. A vitiligo has about 30/40% chance of inheritance. My family has some doubts that this problem exist in my wife's family. I am so confused here as I have a fear, what would happen if I get ready for child? Is my child going to have the vitiligo issue... I want you to help me in this situation..please tell me how would I handle this situation? should I go for the child? how would I treat my in laws if this is a hidden secret? please advise me...I will be very thankfull to you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The fact that your wife developed this skin problem only after her marriage indicates that her family couldn’t have been hiding this issue from you. Nonetheless, accept the circumstances as they are and pursue medical treatment for this problem.\n\n2. No, this is not a valid excuse to practise birth control. There is absolutely no guarantee of the child also being born with this illness. A number of diseases, according to the medical fraternity, are ‘hereditary’ but this does not prevent the world over from having children. Do not fear. Leave everything in the hands of Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
