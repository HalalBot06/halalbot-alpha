  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhile your nikah would be correct without the permission of your father, do you really want to deprive yourself of having his blessings?\n\nExplain your situation to him and inshalah he will agree. Make sure that your nikah is performed in public, not a hidden affair and that all the commandments of Shariah are adhered to. Try to keep good ties with your family and listen to them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
