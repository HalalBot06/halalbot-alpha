  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsslam mu alaikum Mufti Sahab, I have couple of question to ask you. 1.I am a shafa'ee...sometimes i miss my fajar parayer...so i do kaza for that...so in kaza also i have to read Duwae-qunoot(Qunoot-e-nazla). 2.Can you please interprate this dream of mine. I am working in Saudi arabia.....in the month of Ramazan i have seen the strange dream..... i have seen that ....i am in haram shariff...and somebody came and open the door of Kaba. and then all of the people went in side the kbah ...and then. i have seen that there are two foot step and somebody was telling us that the foot steps are on Prophet Mohammed(SAWS).Then everybody stand in queue to do ziyarah of those foot steps.......then i have seen that there is one hand with its Thumb and finger of shadat join and its making some movement like its giving some indication and somebody told us that its the hand of prophet Mohammed (SAWS) and he is giving order to the moon to break. can you please interprate this dream for me? and after this Dream i went to perform Umrah on 29th Of Ramazan. 3. How Long beared one should keep?can i trim my beared?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Yes. The qunoot carries the same status in qada as in adaa: Doing it is\nof the ab'aad (major sunnahs) of salah, omission of which will not\ninvalidate the salah, but will create reason to make sajdatu s-sahw.\n2. The splitting of the moon with the indication of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu\nAlayhi Wasallam) is clearly mentioned in the Qur'aan. It is the miracle (Mu'\njiza) of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Allah Ta'ala mentions\nthat miracle in the context of the signs of Qiyaamat.\n3. 'For Muslim males to grow a beard is Waajib (compulsory), and to let it\ngrow a fist length is Waajib. Without any Shar√©e reason to cut or shave is\nHaraam (totally prohibited). He who does so is a Faasiq (sinner) and to\nshorten it less than a fist length is Makruh Tahrimi (near Haraam).' Dari\nAur Ambiyaa Ki Sunnate, Mufti Saeed Palanpuri.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
