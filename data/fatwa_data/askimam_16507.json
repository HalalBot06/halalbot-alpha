Your question is not clear. You first mention “someone writes on a paper I give you divorce once” thereafter you mention “but he does not write the actual word he only writes divorce” but you go on further and mention “but he does use actual word”. Please clarify what do you mean and resend you question. \n\nQ2. & 3. Mere thoughts of divorce does not cause divorce to fall. \n\nAl Bahr ar Ra’iq 3/235 Rasheedia\nFatawa Darul Uloom 9/34 Darul Isha’at\nFatawa Raheemia 7/258 Darul Isha’at\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
