  "answer": "QUESTION\nI read about our Prophets (saw) uncle who was very good to him and who died without accepting Islam. What I don't understand is that why didn't rasool maqbool saw pray to Allah to make him accept islam? He did pray for Omar razeanla anho(or was it Usman razeanla anho) I am not good at names. He did pray for many people to accept islam but why nor for his uncle? Allah would accepted his prayers. I feel very sad and hurt on thinking that he wouldn't go to heaven, because he was so nice to rasool maqbool saw and helped him a lot.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe should understand that whatever happens occurs through the will and%0D%0Adecision of Allah Ta'ala. Allah Ta'ala in His infinite knowledge knows the%0D%0Areasons and wisdom behind every decision. Nevertheless, the incident of the%0D%0Auncle of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), Abu Talib is narrated as%0D%0Afollows:%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen Abu Talib was about to pass away, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Acame to him. Abu Jahl and Abdullah ibn Abi Umayyah ibn Mugheera were also%0D%0Apresent. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) then said to him, 'O My Uncle,%0D%0Asay Laa ilaaha illallaah', I will intercede through it on your behalf in the%0D%0Acourt of Allah.' Abu Jahl and Abdullah ibn Abi Umayyah immediately remarked,%0D%0A'O Abu Talib! Are you going to turn away from the religion of%0D%0AAbdul-Muttalib?' but Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) continued%0D%0Ainviting him and presenting to him the same words, until the last words that%0D%0Acame out from the lips of Abu Talib was that he was on the religion of%0D%0AAbdul-Muttalib and he refused to say 'Laa ilaaha illallaah'.%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'I will continue to make Du'%0D%0Aaa-e-Maghfirat for you as long as I am not stopped from it.' Thereafter,%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala revealed the verse '. It is not allowed for a Nabi or the%0D%0Abelievers to make Du'aa-e-Maghfirat for the Mushrikeen even though they may%0D%0Abe close relatives.' And Allah Ta'ala revealed especially to Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) regarding Abu Talib, '. Indeed you cannot%0D%0Aguide who you wish bur Allah Ta'ala guides whomsoever he wishes.' (Qasas%0D%0AAayat56) - Tafseer ibn Katheer part3 pg.408.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
