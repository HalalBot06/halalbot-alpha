  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy co-worker and Boss know that I am a Muslim and I do not celebrate Christmas. But during Christmas-time, they send me many Christmas gifts, Gift Certificate, candies, and cards, etc. What should I do? Are we allow to use it, if not can we give it to poor muslim brothers or can we give it to non-muslim friends\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt would be best not to accept such gifts. However, if one does accept them,\nthey cannot be classified as Haraam (Forbidden) (Fataawa Mahmoodiyyah Vol5\nPg 227)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
