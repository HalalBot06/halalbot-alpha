  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a 28 year old women who just had a baby im also overweight is it allowed to have surgery on my stomach to remove fat?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIslam is a religion that has taken into consideration the realities and practicalities of life as well as the needs of the individual. To this end, encouragement for women to beautify themselves as well as the fact that Allah loves beauty has been purported in the Ahaadith of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. Having recognised these needs, Islam being a religion of moderation has not given the individuals unbridled liberty but has contextualised these needs in the broader scheme of priorities. Amongst a host of these priorities are modesty, moderation, Amaanat (trust), etc.\n\nAs believers, we ought to be conscious that our bodies, which are mere vessels transporting our souls from realm to another, is the property of Allah, and that we with regard to our bodies serve in the capacity of trustees or custodians. Any alteration, mutilation, etc, will be directly answerable to Allah for which severe reproach has been mentioned in the Ahaadith of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam].\n\nWe, therefore, advise that in the absense of any pressing medical need, it is not permissible to undergo surgery to remove fat. We further advise that you consult your medical practitioner to tailor make a dieting and fitness programme that will enable you to lose excess fat and regain your confidence.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
