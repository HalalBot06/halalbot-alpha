  "question": "Is income Halal? In the Submarine they sell non-Zabiha food like beef and chicken but no Liquor or Swine meat.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsslam Alikum Mufti Sahib, One of my friends has fast food shop called ?Submarine?. In the Submarine they sell non-Zabiha food like beef and chicken but no Liquor or Swine meat. One of our common friend thinks that since he is selling non-Zabiha food, which is Haram for Muslim, so his earning from this business is also Haram. Let me make this clear that Submarine is famous food chain here and all Muslim mass here knows what they sell. Anybody who consumes food from these Submarines knows what he or she is eating and responsible for that. Can you please comment on this and please let me know your bases of comments. Jazakallah Kharun.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo sell non-Zabiha food is Haraam, even if it is sold to non-Muslims. The\nincome acquired from such a sale is Haraam.\n\nThe Fuqahaa have stated that animals that are not made proper Zabiha of,\nsuch meat are filth. The sale of filth is Haraam, and the income derived\ntherefrom is Haraam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
