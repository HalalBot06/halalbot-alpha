  "question": "He issued three Talaqs without realizing",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nmy husband and i had an argument the other night and during that argument alot of hurtful things were said to each other and the argument got out of control, and he said the three talaaqs unknowingly without thinking of the consequences. within  minutes he realised what he had done, he did not mean it at all, it was said in a rage of anger and purely in an angry state. and he repented against it straight away and did taubah. however we were both in the nafaak state so i just want to know if the talaaq is valid and what do we do now. thank you.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe three talaqs issued in a state of anger are valid. The nikah has been terminated. Your’ll cannot stay together as husband and wife. The state of napaaki will not change the ruling.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
