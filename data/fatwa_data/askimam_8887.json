(56:22). Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?They will be women with wide eyes having a sharp contrast between the white of the cornea and the black of the iris. They will be fair complexioned and their limbs will be free of hair like the wings of a bird.? %0D%0A%0D%0AUmm-e-Salma (Radhiallaahu Anhu) then asked for an explanation of the verse, ?They will be like concealed pearls? (56:23) to which Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) explained that their purity would be like that of a earl still inside the oyster, untouched by human hands.?%0D%0A%0D%0AShe then asked for an explanation of the verse, ?They will be good and fair? (55:70) to which Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) replied, ?Their character will be good and their faces will be fair.? She then asked Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) to explain the verse, ?It will be as if they are preserved eggs.? Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Their softness and delicacy would be like that of the skin you see inside the egg under the shell.? %0D%0A%0D%0AShe then asked Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) to explain the verses, ?We made them virgins, loving and equal in age.? (56:36, 37). Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) explained, ?They will be those women who left this world old, grey-haired and purch-skinned. Allah will recreate them after this old-age and will make them loving virgins who would be very passionate towards their husband who in turn would be madly in love with them. They would all be of the same age.? %0D%0A%0D%0AShe then asked, ?O Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), are the women of this world superior or the hurs?? He replied, ?The women of this world will have superiority over the hurs just as the outer lining of a garment has superiority over the inner lining.? Umm-e-Salma (Radhiallaahu Anhu) then asked, ?O Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), what is the reason for this?? He answered, ?Because they performed Salaat, fasted and worshipped Allah. Allah will put light on their faces and silk on their bodies. (the human women) will be fair in complexion and will wear green clothing and yellow jewellery. Their incense-burners will be made of pearls and their combs will be of gold. They will say, ?We are the women who will stay forever and we will never die. We are the women who will always remain in comfort and we will never die. We are the women who will always remain in comfort and we will never undergo difficulty. We are the women who will stay and we will never leave. Listen, we are happy women and we will never become sad. Glad tidings to those men for whom we are and who are for us.?%0D%0A%0D%0AShe then asked, ?A women of this world married two, three or four husband in this world, then dies and enters Jannah with them, who will be her husband?? Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) answered, ?O Umm-e-Salma (Radhiallaahu Anhu), she will be allowed to choose between them, so she will choose the one with the best character. She will say to Allah, O Allah, this husband displayed the best character to me in the world, so marry him to me.? Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) further added, ?O Umm-e-Salma, good character has gained (for him) the excellence of this world and the hereafter.?%0D%0A%0D%0A[narrated by Tabrani vol.23 pg.367; ibn Kathir in his Tafseer under verse22 Surah56]%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
