  "answer": "QUESTION\nI read this article a few weeks ago and am confused. I thought A'raaf was the place where those who's good and bad deeds were equal go, and eventually they are admitted into Jannah. In the article it mentions quite a few other people, including children. But I thought those who died in childhood were seen by Rasulullah Salla Allahu 'Alayhi wa Sallam underneath a tree with Ebrahim 'Alayhis Salaam.\n\nBelow is the article:\n***\nCompanions of the A’raf [a boundary between Hell and Paradise] are of various types. Some of them are as follows:\n[1] People whom the message of Islam did not reach in the first place, such as residents of mountain tops who have not associated anyone with their Lord nor rejected [His existence] but they have also not believed in Him. They are like animals which do not turn to God, neither in negation nor confirmation. They pay attention to the things of their interest only.\nOr it is such that they received the message of Islam but they did not derive benefit from it on account of their ignorance, such as those people who did not understood the language of Islam nor did they grasp its argument.\nOr they were brought up heedless towards such deep thinking. The extent of their knowledge was that Muslims are people whose turbans are of a particular type and whose shirts are of a particular sort and who eat certain things and hold certain others as forbidden.\nOr they are the people who engage with us in combat over kingdom, thus unavoidably we must fight with them. Despite all this, they had not associated anyone with God and were like animals even though they were constitutionally sound.\n[2] People who are defective in intelligence, such as children, the insane, the mentally handicapped, farmers and slaves, i.e. those who are unable to distinguish right from wrong and are hardly able to recognize their Lord and worship Him. They are like water which on account of its weakness cannot be printed upon. From such people it is only sought that they bear resemblance to Muslims and obey their manifest orders so that the True Word not be divided. This much faith is enough for them which the Holy Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) considered enough for a black woman who when asked where Allah was had pointed to the sky.\nAs far as the first kind of people are concerned it is necessary that they are explained the truth clearly, so that they may be able to understand it, and the argument and the guidance is unambiguously proved before them as true.\n(Al-Budur al-Bazighah, p. 163-164)\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu `alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nChildren who pass away in their childhood fall into two categories: Children of Muslims and the children of the disbelievers.\n\nChildren of the Muslims who pass away in childhood will be in Paradise. However, there is a difference of opinion among the scholars regarding the destination of the children of the disbelievers.[i]\n\nSome commentators of the Quran have mentioned that the Ashāb al-'Arāf are the children of the disbelievers. This view has been recorded by Imam Bagawi (rahmataullahi alayhi) in his tafsīr.[ii]\n\nThe above opinion regarding the children of the disbelievers being from the Ashāb al-'Arāf does not contradict the majority view which states that the  Ashāb al-'Arāf are those whose good and bad deeds are equal. This is because those who did not have the capability or ability to perform good or bad deeds conscientiously will also fall into this category of being “equal” in their good and bad deeds such as the children and mentally-challenged are. That is why Shah Waliullah (rahmataullahi alayhi) says regarding the Ashāb-ul-'Arāf in Al-Budūr Al-Bāzigah: “Companions of the Arāf are of many kinds...”\n\nThe dream in which in the children are seen around the Prophet Ibrahim (alayhis salam) is an authentic hadīth. Some have said that it refers to both the children of the believers and disbelievers alike, while others have said that the children meant here are the children of the disbelievers. [iii] [iv]\n\nRegardless of the fact, that too would not contradict the view of the children of the disbelievers being from the Ashāb al-'Arāf since Al-'Arāf is not a permanent destination and its inhabitants are only there as a temporary measure. Additionally, the Ashāb al-'Arāf stand delivered from the Hellfire but have not entered Paradise yet, which they eventually will through the intercession of Rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam).[v]\n\nAnd Allah knows best.\n\nMl.
