  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. I am working with the government. Due to economic crisis, we don?t have a definite job around, most of the time we spent without doing nothing. The contract is based on the hour, whether we are working or not. I feel it?s better for me to use the time for something useful i.e read Qur?an, ta?lim etc. (inside or outside the office). Is it OK? 2. Ref7480:Masturbation is only permitted in the case of premature ejaculation therapy. Is that correct? 3. I left my country for 3 years, while my salary was accumulated in a bank. I don?t know exactly how much is the total interest. What should I do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If you do not have any work to do during the employment hours, you cannot engage in any other personal activity without the consent of your employer. You must seek permission from your employer before engaging in any personal activity.\n\n2. In our response to question 7480, we did not make that comment. It will not be permissible to masturbate if there is an adequate alternative to cure oneself from premature ejaculation.\n\n3. If you know how much was your salary, the surplus amount will be interest if you did not have any other savings in the Bank. If you cannot calculate that for any reason, you may apply your honest discretion and remove the interest amount by giving it in charity to the poor and needy.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
