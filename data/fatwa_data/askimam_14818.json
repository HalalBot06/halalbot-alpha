  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a muslim girl who saw an angel when sh was a little girl, also my mother saw angels as well even i mecca...subhannallah...what does that mean? also when my mom was pregnant with my brother she had an angel that told her to name the child youseef but did not and so his entire life has been in trouble...what is that we can do so he can live a good life?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n  How do you and your mother know that what your’ll have seen were angels?\n  Nevertheless, good and bad is all decreed by Allah. If your mother did not follow the advice given to her in naming the child that does not have any bearing in the life of the child. Every human being experiences some difficulties in life. That is actually the purpose of life. We are created to be tested, by Allah. For that we will encounter difficulties and hardships. No human being is completely trouble free. A happy and content human being is he who submits to the order of Allah and the way of Rasul Allah sallallahu `alayhi wassalam. After that what one faces is beyond ones control and the decree of Allah. As creations of Allah, we simply submit to his will. That is the end of all agony!\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
