  "question": "Referring to your response for Q10610, it is said in a Hadith that fewer women than men will enter Paradise, then how can every man have a minimum of two wives in Jannah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDon?t understand the math. Also, please narrate the Hadith about fewer women entering Jannah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSayyiduna Imraan ibn Husayn [Radhiallaahu anhu] reports that Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] said, ?I saw women as the major inhabitants of Jahannum.? (Sahih Bukhari Hadith3241; Sahih Muslim Hadith6872, 6873)%0D%0A%0D%0ASayyiduna Imraan ibn Husayn [Radhiallaahu anhu] reports that Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] said, ?I saw women as the minority of the inhabitants of Jannah.? (Sahih Muslim Hadith6877)%0D%0A%0D%0AThese Ahaadith gives the impression that the women of this world will be less in Jannah compared to the men. However, Sayyiduna Abu Hurayra [Radhiallaahu anhu] was asked as to who will be in the majority in Jannah, the human males or females, he replied by narrating the Hadith in which Rasulullah [Sallallaahu alayhi Wasallam] has stated that ?every male in Jannah will have 2 (human) wives.? (Sahih Muslim Hadith7076)%0D%0A%0D%0AHafiz ibn Hajar al-Asqalani [ra] says, ?Sayyiduna Abu Hurayra [Radhiallaahu anhu] used this Hadith as a proof to maintain that there would be more women in Jannah than men? and this is clearly understood.? (Fath al-Baari vol.6 pg.400; Hadith3246)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Muhadditheen (experts in Hadith) have resolved this apparent contradiction through the following explanations:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. These Ahaadith are clear that females in Jannah and Jahannum will outnumber males by a great margin. (Sharh al-Nawawiy vol.9 pg.170)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The women could be more in Jahannam and less in Jannah at the beginning. Thereafter, when they are cleansed of their sins or when intercession on their behalf is accepted, they would be entered into Jannah and they would outnumber the men there too. (Fath al-Baari vol.6 pg.401; Hadith3246 ? Sifatul Jannah of Hafiz ibn Katheer pg.130)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. The Ahaadith that indicate the women as the major inhabitants of Jahannam refer to that time when Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] had physically seen Jannah and Jahannam. They do not mention that it will always remain like that.
