  "question": "My friend lied that her grandfather passed away to get leave from work. Her work friends gave money for the funeral. What must she do with the money? Is this a big sin?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is considered a major sin to lie. Allah Ta'ala curses the liars in the holy Qur'aan. Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] states, 'A person continues uttering lies until a time comes when Allah counts him from the liars.'\n\nTherefore, it is incorrect to try and get leave through lies. Furthermore, out of sympathy, work friends had given some money based on false information. It is incorrect for her to use the money. It is her duty to return the money and inform them about the misinformation. She should make sincere tawbah (repentance) and make a firm determination never to repeat the sin again.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
