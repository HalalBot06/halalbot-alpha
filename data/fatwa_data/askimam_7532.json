  "answer": "QUESTION\n1.As regards to your answers for cigarette, can we place tea(tea powder) in the same category or something similar to 'impermissible', because it(tea) is also an addiction. Secondly one becomes subjugated towards its desire and becomes a captive of this drink. Note that it is not a necessity like food, without which man cannot live. 2. If a boy and a girl commit fornication, and thereafter marry each other without repentance, will the sin of zina still be on them? What if they repent sincerely but dont marry. will the sin be washed off?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The reason cigarette smoking is prohibited is it being harmful and injurious to health. Being addicted to cigarette smoking leads to the continuous harm and injury through cigarette smoking. Drinking tea is not as harmful and injurious to health like cigarette smoking and therefore non-analogous.\n\n2. Fornication is a major sin for which repentance is compulsory, irrespective of the guilty parties getting married or not. If they sincerely repent, Allah, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful will show His Mercy and forgive the sin of fornication.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
