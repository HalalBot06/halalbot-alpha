  "question": "Eating lobster is haraam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs eating lobster, shrimp, etc haraam? Is it the same as eating pig? (For Hanafi)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n>From seafood, only fish is made Halaal for us. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu\nAlayhi Wasallam) said, 'Two carions are made Halaal for us; Fish and locust.\n' (Mishkaat vol.2 pg.361). Fish is classified as a Vertebra.\n\nShrimps and lobsters are not vertebras, hence, not permissible.\n\nSome Ulama are of the opinion that shrimps, etc. are fish, therefore,\npermissible. Due to the differences of opinion, it is best to adopt Taqwa\nand abstain from eating shrimps, etc. but they cannot be regarded as swine\nmeat which is expressly Haraam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
