  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamualaikum, 1) During those Rakats of Fard Salah in which the imam recites softly, is it permissible for the Muqtadis to make dua in their own mother-tongues in their hearts, without moving the lips. What would you recommend is the best thing to do at this time, since it is not permissible to recite anything with the lips? 2) It is mentioned in Fatwa # 14008 regarding the conditions for acting upon weak Ahadith: (c) One should not believe the Hadith to be authentic, rather he should be practising on it for purposes of Ihtiyaat (precaution, i.e. if it is really a Hadith and one does not practise on it one may be taken to task.â€™) Many books which are widely read, such as Muntakhab Hadith, Fazail-e-Amaal, etc. contain some weak Hadith, but we lay people do not know which Hadith is weak and which is Hasan or Saheeh. In this case, I find it hard to follow condition c) mentioned above because I don't know which Hadith I should follow with Yaqeen that it is from Rasulullah (sallalahu alahi wasallam) and which Hadith I should follow for Ihtiyaat. Also, sometimes some 'Aalim may quote a number of Ahadith and then say that some of them are weak without mentioning individually which is weak and which is not. In such cases, can you suggest some way of practicing condition c) for acting on weak Ahadith. 3) In Fatwa # 19778 (http://askimam.org/fatwa/fatwa.php?askid=1f48edd676443d73507cb1f0c9b71251), the Ayaat of Surah Naml contain some typing mistakes. It is requested that they be corrected. It is also requested that this request is not published. 4) It is requested that you make dua for my and my family's Maghfirah and Islah. Jazakallah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:"
