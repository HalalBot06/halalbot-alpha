  "question": "Why dont the Egyptian Qurra have a beard?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni hav a question with regards to the egyptian qurra who recite with a melodius and sweet voice. At one time Egyptian government forbade anyone to have a beard but that is not the case anymore, so why do they still not grow a beard? also they get paid huge amounts of money for reciting the quran...is this allowed?\n\nthe other question is with regards to ordinary people like me who does not understand arabic yet i enjoy so much their recitation because it makes me think how great Allah truly is by giving us the glorious book of the Quran and it also makes me think how beautiful and sweet Dawood's (AS) voice must be.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nWe are not in a position to comment on the issue of the Quraa and them not growing a beard.\nTo recite the Quran is an act of ibadah. In principle, it is not permissible to receive remuneration for an act of ibadah. It is possible that some Qurra are hired by the government to conduct Qirat programs. The government in turn fulfills their personal needs as they are not in a position to earn due to being engaged with such programs.    \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
