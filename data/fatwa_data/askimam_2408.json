  "question": "Looking at women in the eye while conversing, wife not responsive, and drinking medicine containing alcohol.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. In America if you don't look at anybody in the eye while conversing with them they consider it as an insult, especially if one is speaking with a lady. How do I handle this situation, as they consider it chauvinistic, not looking at women? Thank you very much. 2. The purpose of marriage is to fulfil one's innate desires, that's why we have been ordered to make Nikah. But what if one's wife is not responsive, she refuses nine out of ten times? What is the husband supposed to do in such a situation? 3. Is it ok to drink medicines containing alcohol?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. As much as the United states has a culture of freedom, Islam teaches us%0D%0Ato%0D%0Atake preventive measures. The lowering of the gaze is a Quraanic%0D%0Ainjunction which is binding. When you communicate with a female it needs to%0D%0Abe explained that by you lowering your gaze is an act of respect rather than%0D%0Achauvanism. as looking at a non mehram woman could easly lead to%0D%0Atemptation. However you do not need to turn your back to her or look away%0D%0Abut%0D%0Ayou can just lower your gaze.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. As it is obligatory for a wife to answer the call of the husband to bed%0D%0Ahe needs to consider that maybe an underlying reason that could be affecting%0D%0Ayour relationship. This avenue needs to be investigated because if there is%0D%0Aa medical reason thats affects her then she is not obliged to%0D%0Aanswer your call as Stated in a Hadith.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. It is permissable to take medicine containing alcohol as long as there is%0D%0Ano alternative to that specific medicine being used.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
