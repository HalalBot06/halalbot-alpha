  "answer": "QUESTION\nI want to ask if I like a girl and my parents ask this Hakim about it and he says that she is not the best match, although my heart is at ease, what shall I do ?\n\nI have performed istikhaara and I'm happy but I just want to know about getting advice from Hakims or Maulanas, and I'm not sure how they ascertain whether a prospective girl is good or not.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf you consulted with your seniors and also made Istikhaara and you are happy and satisfied with your decision, then that is sufficient. There is no need to refer the decision to a Haakim or Moulana.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
