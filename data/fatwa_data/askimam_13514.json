  "question": "I am wondering what is the difference between a Sunni Muslim and a Shiite Muslim?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am a new Muslimah, and I am wondering what is the difference between a Sunni Muslim and a Shiite Muslim? Is it that one believes in the Hadith and other doesn't (respectively) or is it as my Muslim friend says that a Shiite simply prays differently than a Sunni. How does one determine which catergory one is and can one just be simply Muslim? Insha Allah your answer your provide some clarification to my confusion on this issue.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe beliefs of the Ahl Sunnah wal Jamaah and the Shi’ah differ. The beliefs of some Shi’ah are such that they are totally out of the fold of Islaam, whereas the beliefs of others have caused them to be misguided and they are also out of the Ahl Sunnah wal Jamaah. Marrying them and loving them is not permissible. They are generally recognized by their apparent excessive love for Hadhrat Ali (RA) and his children. They know Hadhrat Ali (RA) to be better than Hadhrat Abu Bakr (RA) and Hadhrat Umar (RA). They believe in twelve Imams, they have a traditional ceremony in the month of Murraham because of Hadhrat Hussain’s martyrdom in it, usually they wear black clothes, and they deceive the Sunnis by lying to them understanding it to be an act of devotion. It is hoped that you will recognize the Shi’as by these signs and you will try to remain far away from them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf\nDARUL IFTA – JAMEAH MAHMOODIYAH, SPRINGS\n\nJOINT PROJECT WITH DARUL IFTA, MADRASAH IN’AAMIYYAH, CAMPERDOWN"
