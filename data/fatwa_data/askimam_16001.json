  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it allowed to open one's spouses mail, check other personal documents if one suspects the other of commiting adultery or any other bad habit.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIslam has given great importance to a person’s privacy.  This can be understood from the following hadith:\n\nعن أبى ذر قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم من كشف سترا فأدخل بصره فى البيت قبل أن يؤذن له فرأى عورة أهله فقد أتى حدا لا يحل له أن يأتيه لو أنه حين أدخل بصره استقبله رجل ففقأ عينيه ما غيرت عليه وإن مر رجل على باب لا ستر له غير مغلق فنظر فلا خطيئة عليه إنما الخطيئة على أهل البيت (رواه الترمذى)\n\nAbu Dhar (Radhiyallahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) said, “Who so ever lifts the curtains and peeps inside a house before being granted permission and sees the resident’s body parts which are not allowed to be seen, then verily he has committed an act which was not permissible for him.  If at the moment he was peeping a person saw him and poked his eyes, he will not be responsible.  If a person passes by a house without curtain and glances inside, he will not be at fault, but fault will be on the owner of the house. (Al-Tirmidhi)\n\nIslam also teaches us to think good about others and to refrain from doubts and suspicions. It is stated in a hadith:\n\nعن أبى هريرة أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال إياكم والظن فإن الظن أكذب الحديث ولا تحسسوا ولا تجسسوا ولا تنافسوا ولا تحاسدوا ولا تباغضوا ولا تدابروا وكونوا عباد الله إخوانا\n\nAbu Hurayrah (Radhiyallahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) said, “Refrain from doubts for verily doubts are the worst lies. And do not make inquires, and do not spy, and do not have mutual quarrels, and do not have jealousy, and do not have mutual hatred, and do not have disparity, and become the servants of Allah in brotherhood.” (Muslim)\n\nIn another hadith it is narrated:\n\nعن أبى هريرة  قال نصر  عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال حسن الظن من حسن العبادة (رواه أبو داود)\n\nAbu Hurayrah narrates that Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) said, “Good thought (of others) is from good worship.” (Abu Dawood)\n\nTherefore, one should refrain from suspecting the husband is involved in adultery and other sinful acts.  A key factor for a successful marriage is to have trust in the spouse.  If this hadith cannot be applied to one’s spouse then to whom can it be applicable to?  A person should defend their spouse against such allegations and support them.  Instead of reading through the husband’s private mails and documents, you should adopt means that will bring both closer and create more love.  It is understandable that a wife feels threatened due to the strange behavior of her husband, and she goes through his personal details.  If she comes across any inappropriate information, she should discuss the issue directly with him and assist him to come out of his bad habits.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
