Those softwares will be sold to banks. And we need to support and amend some transactions includes Interest transaction time to time. You've given Fatwa that 'Derivatives is haram' . So is it permissible to work in this software developement company?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe ruling regarding working in the software development company mentioned in the query will depend on the nature of the company:\n\n·        If the sole purpose of the company is to develop software for Banks and other unislamic financial institutes, then it will be haraam (impermissible) to work for such a company.\n\n·        If the company develops all kinds of software and also develops software for banks and other unislamic financial institutions, then it will makrooh tahrimi (very undesirable) to work for such a company.\n\n(Jawahir al-Fiqh Vol.2 Pg.459-462 – Maktaba Dar al-Uloom Karachi)\n\nIn both cases, it will be advisable to look for another job which is Shari’a compliant. However, you could continue with your present job until you find a suitable job and keep repenting to Allah Ta’ala for being involved in something impermissible.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
