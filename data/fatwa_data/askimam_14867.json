  "question": "I have been in love with a man since last 5 years...",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have been in love with a man since last 5 years. I understand that this kind of relation is prohibited in Islam but we were both not very good muslims when it started. Now for the last 2 years we have been away from each other, living in two different countries and our contact is now very limited. Both of us are now trying to become good muslilms and act as told by Allah and only Allah knows how successful we have been so far. He is living in the UK as a student but due to his family circumstances he wants to settle there. I have also applied for immigration to UK. My question here is if I go to UK and do a registered British marriage with him just to get him a proper status in the UK and do not have any physical contact with him, what will be the status of our marriage according to Islam? Will it be a valid marriage according to Islam without Nikah? WeÂ will not live together. Will I be able to do nikah with some other man if the registered marriage is not valid? Its just that I still love this man very much and want to do something for him. He really needs to work properly in the UK to help his family and without proper status he is unable to do it. So I want to do this good deed to him but I also want to know how it will stand in the eyes of Allah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nIt is not permissible for you to register a British marriage with the person to assist him to get U.K. status. That is cheating and deception which is prohibited. Muslims living in in non-Muslims countries should live as loyal citizens and not violate the laws of the country. If they are uncomfortable with any particular law, use the appropriate channels available to them to address such issues of concern.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
