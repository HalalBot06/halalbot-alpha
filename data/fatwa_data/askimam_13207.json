  "question": "divorced but still she wants to go to school during iddah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy sister got divorced almost two months back. She is 18 years old. As far as I know, she is supposed to stay home for 4 months and 10 days. But she is continuing going to school . She is doing her 1st year degree (B.Com). The question is, Is she allowed to go to school only for studies, otherwise she will miss her classes and we generally don’t like the idea of allowing girls to go for tuitions later; or should she stay back. Additionally, she is my youngest sister and doesn’t want to listen to anyone at home. She fights with my mother and other sister too. Is it right to get some treatment done from an A’lim, during this period of iddat. We are a tablighi family. Please do make duaa for us. Thanks in advance for your time and advice. Wassalam. (Brother of the girl).\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn principle, a divorcee must spend her iddat of 3 menses in the confines of her home. If a divorcee is conceived, the iddah will be till birth. It is incorrect for your sister to continue her studies and go to the university during her iddah. She could study at home or catch up her studies later.\n\nIt is natural for your sister to be upset at this stage. Console her and offer her words of love and care. That attitude will win you her confidence. It is then that you could explain to her the Shari’ah laws of iddah and advise her to observe the rules of iddah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
