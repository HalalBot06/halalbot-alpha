  "answer": "QUESTION\n(I recommend you to read the article in its entirety)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA few comments on the article \"The Dream of anti-Islam forces\"%0D%0A%0D%0AOur comments will briefly focus on references made to the Tablighi Jamaat.%0D%0A%0D%0ATo understand the stance of the Tablighi Jamaat, one has to accept that if a%0D%0Aperson or group concentrates on one field of activity, it does not mean that%0D%0Athey are opposed to all other fields. While this may be a straightforward%0D%0Aprinciple of life, only mischief-makers would like to overlook this axiom to%0D%0Apropagate their malevolent precepts.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Tablighi Jamaat has focused its efforts on reviving the conviction on%0D%0AImaan, and bringing the basic A'maal (deeds) into one's life. Other%0D%0Aactivities are left to other Ulama to carry out. Jihad, Social welfare, Ta'%0D%0Aleem (education), politics, Dawah (inviting non-Muslims to Islam) etc. are%0D%0Abeing undertaken by other Ulama. The Tablighi Jamaat does not oppose such%0D%0Aefforts, but concentrates it's energies in its sphere of activity. Can such%0D%0Anon-involvement be construed to mean opposition? The injustice of the writer%0D%0Ain quite apparent.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Tablighi Jamaat is no secret organisation. It has no offices or office%0D%0Abearers. All its activities are wide open for the entire world to analyse.%0D%0AThe test of the pudding is in the eating. We challenge any person who has%0D%0Abeen poisoned by this article to spend just three days with any Tablighi%0D%0AJamaat group to ascertain for himself if the Tablighi Jamaat does teach that%0D%0Awhich the writer attributes to them. It will then be clear that the writer%0D%0Ais mischievousness and has a hidden agenda.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe have provided a simple acid test to appraise the worth of the article. We%0D%0Aare confident that this will expose the writer has either been misled or%0D%0Aintentionally wishes to mislead the public.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis is sufficient for the seeker of truth. And salaams be on those striving%0D%0Ato acquire guidance.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Imraan Vawda%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
