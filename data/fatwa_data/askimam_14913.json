  "question": "Is this hadeeth with additional phrase correct?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDoes this hadeeth excist?\n\n Aishah R.A. said that the Prophet -may Allaah raise his rank- after the taslim in prayer used to sit as long at it takes to say . Allaahumma anta Al-Salaam wa minka Al-Salaam Tabaarakta Yaa Dhaa-l-Jalaali Wa Al-Ikraam.\" then he used to stand up to perform his sunnah prayer. (Muslim, Abu Dawud, Tirmizi)\n\nI did check the sources mentioned, i found the hadeeth BUT without the words: '' then he used to stand up to perform his sunnah prayer''\n\nA Hanafi scholar quoted the above hadeeth with the additional phrase as a proof that the tasbihat,zikr and dua after prayer, are must made after the whole prayers and not after fard prayers if there is a sunnah to pray. Another alim said to me that this hadeeth has not the additional phrase, and that the hadeeth proves that Nabi SAW did not sit longer than the mentioned dhikr and then turned towards the sahaba after prayer.\n\nIs this hadeeth with additional phrase correct?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe ruling pertaining Zikr and Dua after Salaah is that it is preferable to read them after the whole prayer; i.e. after the Sunnats, etc. However, if one reads them before the Sunnats, it will be regarded as undesirable, but the person will not be sinful.\n\n \nRad-ul-Muhtar Vol: 1 Pg: 530 (H.M. Sa’eed Company)\n\nويكره تأخير السنة إلا بقدر اللهم أنت السلام إلخ\n\n( قوله إلا بقدر اللهم إلخ ) لما رواه مسلم والترمذي عن عائشة قالت { كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم لا يقعد إلا بمقدار ما يقول : اللهم أنت السلام ومنك السلام تباركت يا ذا الجلال والإكرام } وأما ما ورد من الأحاديث في الأذكار عقيب الصلاة فلا دلالة فيه على الإتيان بها قبل السنة ، بل يحمل على الإتيان بها بعدها\n\nHashiyat-ut-Tahtaawi Pg: 331 (Darul kutub Alilmiyyah)\n\nFataawa Mahmoodiyah Vol: 2 Pgs: 157 and 210 (Maktabah Mahmoodiyah)\n\nAs far as the additional phrase is concerned, it was not found in any of the books in the limited resources available to us. However, it is possible that the Hanafi scholar found it in a book not available to us; or he could be trying to explain the practice of Nabi (Sallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) in his own words.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
