  "question": "How should you react (for a male) when a kafir provokes or threatens you?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI heard that the kuffar should have fear in their hearts when they pass a Muslim. So if a kafir tries to threaten you, should you ignore it or stand up to him?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a Muslim is sincere and dedicated to Shari'ah and he obeys the ordains of\nShari'ah, Allah Ta'ala grants him respect and fills the hearts of people\nwith awe for him.\n\nIf a Muslim person is under threat by anyone (Muslim or non-Muslim) due to\nemotions, etc. he should ignore the person and avoid being provoked. Allah\nTa'ala describes the characteristics of his noble servants in the Qur'\naan-e-Kareem, 'When the ignorant address them, they avoid them with\ndiplomacy by saying salaam (turn away).'\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
