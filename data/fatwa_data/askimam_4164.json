  "question": "If a man marries a women only to realise on his wedding night that she is not a virgin, What are the repercussions ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe second part of your question is ambiguous. What do you mean by\nrepurcussion? Kindly elaborate.\n\nHowever, before committing to marriage, a person (male or female) has the\nright to enquire and investigate any matter relevant to marriage concerning\nthe potential marriage partner. If he/ she did not do so, that will be\nconsidered as negligence on his/her part. Marriage is a major step in ones\nlife and it is expected of a person to exercise extreme precaution before\ncommitting to marriage. If upon investigating, the person was misled, that\nwill be deception. In the context of your question, if a male enquired from\na female about her virginity before marriage, and was misled, then he has\nthe right to address that with his wife.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT"
