  "answer": "QUESTION\nI want to ask you for a Dua or Sura?a from which I can recite so to remove the this disease from my body, as I used to masturbate for fun & about which you told me that it is Haram. As this creates really a great weakness in the man?s body n due to this man losses his manlihood (due to this man becomes namurd) I want to know about a Dua or Sura?a so that I can recite it & so that this disease is removed from the body & so that the power I have lost it doing wrongs could be recovered.. Please tell me what to recite (SURA?A or DUA) so that I can get rid of this weakness & disease(na murdy or loss of manlihood)? I will be thankful to you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou state that you have lost your manhood due to masturbation. It is indeed very sad to note this. We have cautioned our readers repeatedly to guard themselves against this evil which can cause them extreme harm and danger. What is left in a man after he loses his manhood?\n\nWe advise you make sincere Tawbah to Allah for destroying the gift He had given you. Make a firm intention never to do that again and beg Allah to restore the manhood in you. You should also consult your physician and discuss the matter with him as loss of manhood and restoring it may require medical attention. We, once again, urge our readers to abstain from masturbation and everything that leads to masturbation. There is no effect without a cause. Why do you need to indulge in a sickness and cure yourself if you can prevent the sickness. Consider the saying, ?prevention is better than cure?.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
