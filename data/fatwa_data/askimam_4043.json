  "question": "Salaams Mufti Saheb, What should one do if during the two rakaats of Farz in Jummah Salaat wudhu is broken and by going to perform wudhu the imam is likely to finish the salaat.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person's Wudhu breaks during Jummu'ah Salaat, he should renew his Wudhu\nand make Bina (join the congregation). If the Salaat completed, he should\ncomplete the Salaat himself individually.\n\nBina will be valid only if he goes to the nearest place to make Wudhu, and\ndoes not talk with anyone in between.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
