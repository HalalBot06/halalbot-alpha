  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam u Akilum Mufti Sahab, I need your Advice. Mufti Sahab I have this friend who is christen but he shows interest in Islam he says things like your religion seems better then main, and he always asks me questions about Islam. First I didn?t take him seriously but now I thing he wants to change but he can?t make his mind. I have given him cassettes to listen to and I took him to other new Muslim and I even took him to the Masjid and he liked it. He asked me for a English copy of Quran, I didn?t give it to him yet but I think he won?t understand it I am not saying that he has less of a mind then me but I thing I should give him a copy of ?Fazail a Amal? what do u think. Also I want to know what should I do next. I hope (Hadayet) Islam is written for him.
