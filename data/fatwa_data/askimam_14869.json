  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf a muslim is invited to a jewish wedding, can he/she eat the kosher food?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAllah Taala has permitted the meat of Ahle-Kitaab (Christian and Jews) with the same conditions that are required for Muslims. That is to recite the name of Allah before slaughtering the animal and the animal should be slaughtered by severing at least three out of four veins.\n\nIf meat slaughtered by Muslims is available, Muslims should not eat the meat of Ahle-Kitab. In the absence of meat slaughtered by Muslims, and if there is a need, then only one may eat the meat of Ahle-Kitab with the above mentioned two conditions.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
