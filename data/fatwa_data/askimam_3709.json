  "question": "Who does one make niyyah for when performing esaala sawaab?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti, I am aware that when performing esaale sawaab , be it the recitation of the Qur'an or anything else, the reward is not decreased on behalf of the performer. So when doing esaale sawaab is it not best to pray that the reward reaches all of the deceased Muslims rather than just one's own relatives/ friends? When the Prophet (saw) did esaale sawaab what was his general practice i.e did he specify to whom the reward should go to or did he pray for all the deceased Muslims?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOne may perform an act of virtue and make intention to give the reward to\nall the deceased. Insha Allah, the person who performed the deed as well as\nall those intended will be rewarded.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
