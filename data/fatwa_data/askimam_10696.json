You cannot expect to overcome the weakness without addressing the issue with him. You married to maintain your chastity. That cannot be attained if you are not satisfied. You are young and you should guard yourself against the plots of the Shaytaan.%0D%0A%0D%0AThere is no shyness in discussing such an issue with your husband. Solutions can be sought only after agreeing on a problem. Probably, that will address the issues raised in your subsequent quesries.

It should not cause any internal or external-harm to the body%0D%0A2. It should not contain any haraam ingredients,%0D%0A3. It should not be inserted into the inner-private part of the women, rather such toys should be used that stimulate the outer private parts, such as the clitoris.%0D%0A4. It should only be used in foreplay and in order to enhance the act of intercourse, not to substitute it.%0D%0A5.
