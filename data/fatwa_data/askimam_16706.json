  "question": "Amil told me to make a Niyyat in my Salaah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI was recently told by an amil that when i make my intention for salaah i should as Allah to remove the angel of distraction  :\n\n\"Almighty Allah please remove Hazrath Imam Awabeen Kinzab from my path\"\n\nfirstly is this true ?\nand can u please provide a hadith ?\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is not a condition for the validity of salah to make such an intention. In one commences salah without making such an intention, then too the salah will be valid even if the Shaitan distracts one in salah. The best way to deal with the distraction of Shaitan is to concentrate in salah and ignore any involuntary thoughts.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
