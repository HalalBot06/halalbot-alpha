  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI'm from but currently residing in Jeddah for employment and been here for around four months. I and some of my friends who are also from Pakistan and are here for less than one year had perform Umrah in the month of Shawal and Zil-Qaeda which we understand that are called Hajj months. Please help us while answering to our below questions as Hajj days are approaching.\n\n \nOur questions are as below;  \n\n1) Based on the time period since we are here so are we called as Makki (as per your definition in other Fatwa's that whoever lives inside Meqat is also called Makki)? \n\n \n\n2) From your different Fatwa's it came to our knowledge that we cannot offer any other type of Hajj except Hajj-e-Ifrad. Know since we have already offered Umrah do we need to slaughter as DUMM or it is not obligatory for us? \n\n 3) Can we clear and cut our unwanted hairs, hairs, and nails after 1st Zil Hajj as we are offering Hajj and also Qurbani. Please explain?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh  \n\n1.      Since you are living in Jeddah, which is considered part of the hill, you will be considered as a Makki. (Fatāwā Mahmūmidiyyah v. 10 pg. 387)\n\n2.      It will be binding upon you to slaughter one sheep or one share of a camel as dum.\n\n3.      It is desirable for those who are planning to sacrifice an animal for Qurbāni to avoid pairing their nails and cutting their hair until the animal is slaughtered. If you are in Ihrām, it will not be permissible to pair your nails and cut your hair. If you are not in Ihrām, then it will be permissible to do so, although it will be preferable to wait until after the sacrifice of the Qurbāni animal.\n\nومما ورد في صحيح مسلم قال رسول الله (ص): إذا دخل العشر وأراد بعضكم أن يضحي فلا يأخذن شعرا ولا يقلمن ظفرا فهذا محمول على الندب دون الوجوب بالاجماع (رد المحتار ج 2 ص 181, سعيد) \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
