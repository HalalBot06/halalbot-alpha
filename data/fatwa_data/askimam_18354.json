  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know about some verses from the Quran.\n\nThe verses are: [Hud said:] “O my people, seek forgiveness from your Lord, then turn to Him in repentance, and He will release the heavens pouring upon you, and will add strength to your strength, and do not turn away like sinners.” (Quran, 11:52)\n\n[Nuh said, “My Lord,] I said, ‘Ask forgiveness of your Lord, Indeed He is Very-Forgiving, and (if you do SO,) He will cause the heavens to rain upon you in abundance, and will help you with riches and sons, and will cause gardens to grow for you, and cause rivers to flow for you. '\" (Quran, 71:10-12)\n\nDoes that mean if I make istighfar and tawba to Allah, I will definitely get the benefits mentioned in those verses, such as increase in strength and wealth and sons etc.?\n\nIf so, do I have to make istighfar and tawba a certain number of times everyday for me to get the benefit? Regarding the first verse mentioned above where it says “add strength to your strength,” what would that mean in my own circumstances? Does it mean I will become stronger physically in my body or increase in political power or economic/financial (more wealth, buying) power?\n\nIs it referring on an individual level or collectively for all Muslims? Anwar Al-awlaki in his series on the Lives of the Prophets mentioned regarding that verse from Surah Hud something to the effect that with istighfar you would become more powerful than you are now and this tells us we’re not making enough istighfar to Allah.\n\nIf we were making istighfar as we should, our situation would not be the way it is today. Is that true?\n\n*this is pretty much a copy of a question I sent previously, I still have not got an answer and I'm eagerly waiting for one\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nSayyiduna Mus’ab ibn Sa’d رضي الله تعالى عنه narrates from his father that he asked Nabi صلى الله عليه وسلم: “which people are the most tested?” Nabi صلى الله عليه وسلم replied:\n\n“The messengers then those who are most close to them and so on. A person is tested according to his firmness in religion. If he is strong, his test is the same and if he is weak in religion he is tested accordingly. A person continues to be tested until he is left walking on this earth with no sins on him.” (Tirmidhi 2/65 H.M.Saeed)\n\n \n\nسنن الترمذى - (ج 2 / ص 65) سعيد\n\nعن مصعب بن سعد عن أبيه قال قلت يا رسول الله أي الناس أشد بلاء قال الأنبياء ثم الأمثل فالأمثل فيبتلى الرجل على حسب دينه فإن كان دينه صلبا اشتد بلاؤه وإن كان في دينه رقة ابتلي على حسب دينه فما يبرح البلاء بالعبد حتى يتركه يمشي على الأرض ما عليه خطيئة\n\nقال أبو عيسى هذا حديث حسن صحيح وفي الباب عن أبي هريرة وأخت حذيفة بن اليمان أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم سئل أي الناس أشد بلاء قال الأنبياء ثم الأمثل فالأمثل\n\n \n\nIf a person is tested due to his firm faith then repentance would not necessarily relieve his test. To the contrary, if he is tested due to his sins, then repentance would prove beneficial. (Mazhari 12/104)\n\n \n\nRepentance should be in proportion to the sin. Sins which are widespread require repentance also on a wide scale. This is one of the reasons why at the time of drought the Muslim public in general goes out to perform the salah for rain. This salah in reality is the highest form of repenting to Allah Ta’ala. (Tafseer Uthmani)\n\n \n\nRepentance at an individual level will be fruitful at an individual level, and repentance at a collective level will be also bear fruit at a collective level.\n\n \n\nIn today’s time when evil is so wide spread, Muslims have degenerated to such a low level that it has abandoned the basic teaching and morals of Islam then how can we expect the divine help of Allah Ta’ala. Studying the Noble Quran will prove that the promises of power, strength victory etc are all based on the obedience of Allah Ta’ala.\n\n \n\n}وَتُوبُواْ إِلَى اللَّهِ جَمِيعاً أَيُّهَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ } [النور:31]\n\nTurn unto Allah in repentance collectively so that you may be successful. (24:31)\n\n \n\nSayyiduna Abu Hurayrah رضي الله تعالى narrates that he heard Nabi صلى الله عليه وسلم saying:\n\n \n\nصحيح البخاري - (6307)\n\nقال أبو هريرة سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول والله إني لأستغفر الله وأتوب إليه في اليوم أكثر من سبعين مرة\n\n“Verily, I repent to Allah Ta’ala and seek His forgiveness seventy times a day.”\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
