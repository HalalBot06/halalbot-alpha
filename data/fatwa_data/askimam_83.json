If the%0D%0Aanimal cannot be consumed according to Shariah, or was not slaughtered according to Shariah, the gelatine from such an animal will not be permissible. However, if it undergoes a complete change of metamorphosis (Tabdeel-e-Maahiyyat), the gelatine will be permissible. i.e. if metamorphosis takes place in pork gelatine or gelatine derived from an animal not slaughtered according to Shariah, it will be Halaal.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf it does not undergo a complete change, it is not permissible to use it or sell it. The income will be Haraam. However, in a state of Idhtiraar (desperation), one will be excused to use it if there is no alternative and prescribed by a Physician. The state of desperation must be confirmed by a reliable Mufti.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT"
