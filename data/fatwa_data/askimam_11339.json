It is permissible for the spouses to be unclothed in front of each other. It is also permissible for them to kiss one another as they wish. The husband may derive comfort and joy from his wife?s breasts. However, in all acts of intimacy, the spouses should exercise shame and modesty.\n\n2. Mazi is that secretion that comes out when one is excited. In the case of a male, the secretion of Mazi does not lead to diserection as in the case of ejaculation of Mani (sperms). Mazi is impure and invalidates Wudhu. If the undergarment is soiled, then it has to be washed to remove the impurity. There is no need for a bath.\n\n3. Masturbation ? refer attached.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
