  "question": "Are current goverments in Islamic countries are really LEGITIMATE?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWith reference to your answer 11034, where you mentioned the legitmacy of the current goverments. I will just like to know that how come you or any ALAM in this respect can call them Legitimate in the eyes of Islam, when they are using the right of legislation in making laws for humans, which do not orignate from SHARIAH and as a muslim we know that the only authroity Legimate to do this is ALLAH. Even we have very strick AHADEETH regarding these rulers that we should not rebel against them until they perform an OPEN KUFAR. But if we just look at current actions of these goverments which have legalized LAW MAKING not based on SHARIAH through the current DEMOCRACY system and INTEREST in all economic affairs, INDIRECT Taxation on its citizens, which are all evidences of OPEN KUFAR (We both know we can add many more to this list), still on which grounds do you call them legitimate goverments? Becuase to call them legitimate, we have to prove them legitimate from Quran & Sunnah. So please quote me from those, when replying to my question.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou have enumerated two factors, interest and taxation, in support of current Muslim governments committing Kufr. We also condemn all un-Islamic activities of Muslim governments. However, that does not constitute Kufr and does not make their governments illegitimate.\n\nTheir un-Islamic activities are major sins. Declaring someone as a Kaafir is a sensitive issue and we are advised to exercise precaution on that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
