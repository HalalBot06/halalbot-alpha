  "question": "How gender specific were the manuals of Hanafi fiqh (specifically those utilized during Ottoman times) in terms of property rights?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDo the Ottoman manuals of Hanafi fiqh discuss specifically the right of women to manage/dipose of property, or is this implied? Do they discuss specifically women?s rights to establish waqfs or is this implied or derived from the fact that they don?t exclude women?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari'ah (all four famous schools of thought), an adult\nfemale has an independent right to manage all her affairs including\nestablishing a Waqf and administering it.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
