Many books have been written in this regard, however, this is not supported by authentic references. Therefore, no special significance should be given to this.\n\nAllah knows when the child has been conceived. There is no guarantee to prove that the women would conceive from a specific intimate relation. Therefore do what is within our control and leave the rest to Allah. Pray and cry to Allah to make the child an upright and righteous Muslim. The dua of the parent in favour of the child is effective. While the child is in the womb make dua to Allah for him/her. Surely this will be more effective that relaying in something which has no basis.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
