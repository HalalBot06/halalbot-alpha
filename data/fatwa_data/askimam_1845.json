  "question": "I read in the koran that in the last days the jews will be abel to go back in a mingeled crowd. so why the hyostile attitude towards israel if it is the will of Allah.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe do not understand what you are referring to in the Qur'aan.%0D%0AHowever, any information about the future in the Qur'aan and Ahadith is%0D%0Atermed as Taqdeer (pre-destination). Taqdeer actually refers to the perfect,%0D%0Aabsolute and conclusive knowledge of Allah Ta'ala. It does not refer to%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala making people committing acts against His orders, thereby%0D%0Aabsolving people from their evil acts due to them being helpless. Surely%0D%0AAlmighty Allah Ta'ala' will not order helpless people to do anything beyond%0D%0Atheir ability. Allah Ta'ala has ordered the jews to be submissive to His%0D%0Aorders but they (the Jews) were consistently defiant to His orders. Allah Ta%0D%0A'ala therefore repeatedly condemns them for their disobedience. In brief,%0D%0Athe evils of the Jewish people , the Zionist movement, the establishment of%0D%0Athe illegitimate state of Israel, etc., etc., are evils well known by Allah%0D%0ATa'ala , and accordingly condemned by Allah Ta'ala Himself. The purpose of%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala informing us of the evils of the Jewish people is surely to%0D%0Ahate the evils perpetrated by them.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
