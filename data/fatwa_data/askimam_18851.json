  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nOne accident happened to my car. Then insurance claim department arrived and found mistake in both vehicles. I have only the third party insurance which is compelled by the government.\n\nSo I could approach to his (other car owner who hit to my car) Insurance company for the claim. For the above task I have to arrange 3 quotes and one will be accept in insurance company and they will give some percentage of amount as claim in latter\n\nI don’t have any idea in for amount the work shop quote for repair . Most probable it will be higher and this is the custom they used. And I didn’t say anything to the workshop related to quote amount .\n\nSo question is  \n\n·         This claim is halal for me\n\n·         If yes, May be the claim amount will be higher or lower. Is Higher rate is acceptable? What I should do in surplus amount if I received. Example: if total expenses in the work shop are $1000 and allotment from the insurance company is $2000. Could I use balance for my personnel use?\n\nI understand that all insurance are HARAM even third party vehicle insurance also. If so what is alternative solution for you in the view of Islam. Because the accident will happen in the Islamic Country and it may not be the mistake of the owner or somebody made accident intentionally also. if though should owner suffer all the claim of an accident \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nAll types of car insurance are harām whether it is third party insurance or comprehensive insurance as it involves interest and gambling. If, however, one is obliged by the law of the country to do so, then he will be excused.\n\n(Aap Ke Masāil, Vol.6, Pg.248, Maktaba Ludhyānwi)\n\n \n\nIt will not be permissible to lay claim for more than the amount of damages incurred. However, if the insurance company chooses to pay you more than the incurred losses, it will be permissible for you to accept it as it was voluntarily offered by the company.\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl. Abdur Rahman Shareef,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
