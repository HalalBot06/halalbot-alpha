  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPerforming qurbani for deceased relatives (Eid) Is it permisable to perform qurbani on behalf of dead relative etc? if so what intention needs to be made. What about if the names of the deceased relatives are not known? What are the vitues of performing qurbani for the Propeht S.A.W and his companions.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. If a person is Sahib-e-Nisaab, then apart from his Qurbaani, it is permissible for him to perform Nafl Qurbaani on behalf of a deceased person. The deceased will receive the reward of the Qurbaani and the meat can be distributed among the poor and wealthy and can be eaten. However, if the deceased made Wasiyyah and the Qurbaani was done from his wealth, then the meat can only be distributed to the poor and needy. (Fataawa Rahimiyyah vol.8 pg.40; Darul Ishaat)\n\n2. One can make intention that this Qurbaani is for the deceased. However, if the Qurbaani is optional, then intention for more than one Mayyit can be made. (Fataawa Rahimiyah vol.8 pg.25; Darul Ishaat).\n\nHamash [radhiallaahu anhu] says, ‘I saw Ali [radhiallaahu anhu] slaughtering 2 sheep so I asked him why he is slaughtering 2 sheep.’ He said, ‘Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] made Wasiyyah that I should make Qurbaani for him.’ (Tirmidhi pg.275; HM Saeed).\n\nAbbaas [radhiallaahu anhu] says that Sayyiduna Sa’d ibn Ubaadah [radhiallaahu anhu] was away when his mother passed away. When he returned he asked Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], ‘Will it be of any benefit if I give charity on her behalf.’ Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] replied in the affirmative. (Bukhari Hadith2762)\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
