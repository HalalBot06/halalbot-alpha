  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a medical doctor from pakistan and have been practising in S.Africa for 8 years as a locum with covering my face. Recently I moved to the US and have not been working due to the requirement of doing residency which will involve me to remove my purdah (i.e. moving the veil), but that is only for 3 years. After that I believe I can find a job by covering my face and my intention is to work with/for women only.  This thought came to my mind as I myself always seek female doctor for my kids and myself and I relise how importent mfemale doctor if. Since I have the qualification, I might as well utalise it. My thoughts are that Allah knows that I am removing the veil for a short  time and that too is to help the female ummah who is in need of female doctors. I also have a need as my husband who too is a doctor and a practising muslim who is also involved with the work of tableeg jammat, does not give me any money at all because of which I even find it difficul to call my very own perants in pakistan. He claimes that all his money is mine but in HIS bank which I do not have access to. Take a note I did not have too much understanding of deen before but through him Allah almighty bleesed me with sahee knowledge by which I started covering my face. He likes me like that but makes my life difficult otherwise, by not acting upon all that he says himself. Please advise me if My intention is good and if I should work. I have 3 kids too.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nJazakillah for writing to the institute regarding your desire to work.\n\nFirstly, you see a need for Muslim women to be attended to by women doctors and also due to your husband's failure to give you adequate spending money. On the other hand, this will mean that you have to remove your Niqab. Do you feel comfortable about exposing your face to non- mahram men once again? I can identify with you as I too took on the niqab late in life but I cannot cope with the idea that I would have to show my face to any man (other than absolutely necessary). Have you spoken to your husband about your reasons and desire for going to work? Have you pointed out to him that since you do run the home and look after his children, cook, clean the house etc that you are entitled to have money for yourself? What has his response been? If he says that his money is yours, why not ask him to accompany you to the bank and add your signature to his account so that you can withdraw money too? You need to be diplomatic and persuasive. You could point out that you do not wish to have an exorbitant amount. Just enough to buy personal goodies and to call your parents when you wish.\n\nMy concern is that you have three children and they will be exposed to so much fitna in that country depending on where you are and what sort of community you have moved into. It is so important for at least one parent to be at home to guide, council, check on and just be there for the children when they get home from school. The children have rights over their parents.\n\nYour husband and you have to remember that you both will be held accountable about their rights over you two. I do not wish to sound negative, but it is a very real concern as we get so much mail from parents who are torn to bits when their children find that the western way of life completely overtakes them as they were not prepared for the onslaught of shaitaan's tentacles over their hearts and minds. Please write to me again and lets explore the possible approaches you could take. May Allah Ta'ala guide and protect your whole family, ameen.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best.\n\nSister Fadila\nSocial Department\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
