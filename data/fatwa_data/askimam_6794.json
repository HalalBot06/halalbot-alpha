  "question": "What is the relationship of the Day-of-Ashoora (10th Muharram) to the historic events in Karbala?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTHE MONTH OF MUHARRAM%0D%0A%0D%0AMuharram is the month with which the Muslims begin their lunar Hijrah Calendar. It is one of the four sanctified months about which the Holy Quran says, %0D%0A\"The number of the months according to Allah is twelve months (mentioned) in the Book of Allah on the day in which He created heavens and the earth. Among these (twelve months) there are four sanctified\".%0D%0A%0D%0AThese four months, according to the authentic traditions are the months of Dhul-Qa'dah, Dhul-Hijjah, Muharram and Rajab. All the commentators of the Holy Quran are unanimous on this point, because the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) in his sermon on the occasion of his last Hajj, has declared: One year consists of twelve months, of which four are sanctified months, three of them are in sequence; Dhul-Qa'dah, Dhul-Hijjah, Muharram, and the fourth is Rajab. %0D%0A%0D%0AThe specific mention of these four months does not mean that any other month has no sanctity, because the month of Ramadhan is admittedly the most sanctified month in the year. But these four months were specifically termed as sanctified months for the simple reason that their sanctity was accepted even by the pagans of Makkah.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn fact, every month, out of the twelve, is originally equal to the other, and there is no inherent sanctity which may be able which may be attributed to one of them in comparison to the other months. When Allah Almighty chooses a particular time for His special blessings, the same acquires sanctity out of His grace.%0D%0A%0D%0AThus, the sanctity of these four months was recognized right from the days of Sayyidina Ibrahim (Alayhis salaam). Since the Pagans of Makkah attributed themselves to Sayyidina Ibrahim (Alayhis salaam) they observed the sanctity of these four months and despite their frequent tribal battles, they held it unlawful to fight in these months. %0D%0A%0D%0AIn the Shariah of our Noble Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) the sanctity of these months was upheld and the Holy Quran referred to them as the \"sanctified months\".%0D%0A%0D%0AThe month of Muharram has certain other characteristics peculiar to it which are specified below.%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Fasting during the month %0D%0AThe Noble Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has said: 'The best fasts after the fasts of Ramadhan are those of the month of Muharram.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AAlthough the fasts of the month of Muharram are not obligatory, yet, the one who fasts in these days out of his own will and choice is entitled to a great reward by Allah Almighty. The Hadith cited above signifies that the fasts of the month of Muharram are most rewardable ones among the Nafl fasts i.e. the fasts one observes out of his own choice without being obligatory on him.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Hadith does not mean that the award promised for fasts of Muharram can be achieved only by fasting for the whole month. On the contrary, each fast during this month has merit. Therefore, one should avail of this opportunity as much as he can.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The day of 'Ashurah'%0D%0AAlthough the month of Muharram is a sanctified month as a whole, yet, the 10th day of Muharram is the most sacred among all its days. The day is named 'Ashurah'.%0D%0A%0D%0AAccording to the Holy Companion Ibn 'Abbas (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu). The Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), when migrated to Madinah, found that the Jews of Madinah used to fast on the 10th day of Muharram. They said that it was the day on which the Holy Prophet Musa (Moses) (Alayhis salaam) and his followers crossed the Red Sea miraculously and the Pharaoh was drowned in its waters. On hearing this from the Jews, the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, \"We are more closely rotated to Musa (Alayhis salaam) than you\" and directed the Muslims to fast on the day of 'Ashura'. (Abu Dawood)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is also reported in a number of authentic traditions that in the beginning, fasting on the day of 'Ashura' was obligatory for the Muslims. It was later that the fasts of Ramadhan were made obligatory and the fast on the day of 'Ashura' was made optional. Sayyidina 'Aisha (Radhiallaahu %C1nha) has said: %0D%0A\"When the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) came to Madinah, he fasted on the day of 'Ashura' and directed the people to fast it. But when the fasts of Ramadhan were made obligatory, the obligation of fasting was confined to Ramadhan and the obligatory nature of the fast of 'Ashura' was abandoned. Whoever so desires should fast on it and any other who so likes can avoid fasting on it.\" (Sunan Abu Dawud)%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to fast on the day of 'Ashura' even after the fasting in Ramadhan was made obligatory. Abdullah ibn Musa (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) reports that the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) preferred the fast of 'Ashura' on the fasts of other days and preferred the fasts of Ramadhaan on the fast of 'Ashura'. (Bukhari and Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn short, it is established through a number of authentic Hadiths that fasting on the day of 'Ashura' is Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and makes one entitled to a great reward. %0D%0A%0D%0AAccording to another Hadith, it is more advisable that the fast of 'Ashura' should either be prefixed or suffixed by another fast. It means that one should fast two days: the 9th and 10th of Muharram or the 10th and 11th of it. The reason of this additional fast as mentioned by the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is that the Jews used to fast on the day of 'Ashura alone, and the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) wanted to distinguish the Muslim way of fasting from that of Jews. Therefore, he advised the Muslims to add another fast to that of 'Ashura'. %0D%0A%0D%0ASome traditions signify another feature of the day of 'Ashura. According to these traditions one should be more generous to his family by providing more food to them on this day as compared to other days. These traditions are not very authentic according to the science of Hadith. Yet, some Scholars like Baihaqi and Ibn Hibban have accepted them as reliable.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhat is mentioned above is all that is supported through authentic sources about Ashura. However, there are some legends and misconceptions with regard to 'Ashura' that have managed to find their way into the minds of the ignorant, but have no support of authentic Islamic sources, some very common of them are these: %0D%0A- This is the day in which Adam (Alayhis salaam) was created.%0D%0A- This is the day in which Ibrahim was born.%0D%0A- This is the day in which Allah accepted the repentance of Sayyidina Adam (Alayhis salaam)%0D%0A- This is the day on which the Qiyaamah (doomsday) will take place.%0D%0A- Whoever takes bath in the day of 'Ashura' will never get ill. %0D%0A%0D%0AAll these and other similar whims and fancies are totally baseless and the traditions referred to in this respect are not worthy of any credit. %0D%0A%0D%0ASome people take it as Sunnah to prepare a particular type of meal in the day of 'Ashura'. This practice, too, has no basis in the authentic Islamic sources. %0D%0A%0D%0ASome other people attribute the sanctity of 'Ashura' to the martyrdom of Sayyidina Husain (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) during his battle with the Syrian army. No doubt, the martyrdom of Sayyidina Husain (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) is one of the most tragic episodes of our history. Yet, the sanctity of 'Ashura' cannot be ascribed to this event for the simple reason that the sanctity of 'Ashura' was established during the days of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) much earlier than the birth of Sayyidna Husain (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu).%0D%0A%0D%0AOn the contrary, it is one of the merits of Sayyidna Husain (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) that his martyrdom took place on the day of 'Ashura'.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnother misconception about the month of Muharram is that it is an evil or unlucky month, for Sayyidna Husain was killed in it. It is for this misconception that people avoid holding marriage ceremonies in the month of Muharram. %0D%0A%0D%0AThis is again a baseless concept which is contrary to the express teachings of the Holy Quran and the Sunnah. Such superstitions have been totally negated by the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). If the death of an eminent person in a particular day renders that day unlucky for all times to come, one can hardly find a day, free from this bad luck, out of 360 days of the whole year, because each and every day has a history of the demise of some eminent person. The Holy Quran and the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) have made us free from such superstitious beliefs, and they should deserve no attention.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnother wrong practice related to this month is to hold the lamentation and mouming ceremonies in the memory of martyrdom of Sayyidna Husain (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu). As mentioned earlier, the event of Karbala is one of the most tragic events of our history, but the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has forbidden us from holding the mourning ceremonies on the death of any person. The people of jahiliyyah (ignorance) used to mourn over their deceased through loud lamentations, by tearing their clothes and by beating their cheeks and chests. The Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) stopped the Muslims from doing all this and directed them to observe patience by saying \"Innaa lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raaji'oon\". A number of authentic Ahaadith are available on the subject. To quote only one of them: %0D%0A\"He is not from our group who slaps his checks, tears his clothes and cries in the manner of the people of jahiliyyah\". (Sahih Bukhari)%0D%0A%0D%0AAll the authentic jurists are unanimous on the point that the mourning of this type is absolutely impermissible. Even Sayyidna Husain (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) at shortly before his demise, had advised his beloved sister Sayyidah Zainab (Radhiallaahu %C1nha) at not to mourn over his death in this manner. He said, \"My dear sister, I swear upon you that you, in case I die, shall not tear your clothes, nor scratch your face, nor curse anyone for me or pray for your death\". (Al-Kamil, ibn Kathir vol. 4 pg. 24)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is evident from this advice of Sayyidna Husain, (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) that this type of mourning is condemned even by the blessed person for the memory of whom these mourning ceremonies are held. Every Muslim should avoid this practice and abide by the teachings of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and his beloved grand child Sayyidna Husain (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu).%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Taqi Uthmaani"
