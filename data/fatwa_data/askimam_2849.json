  "question": "If a non-Muslim asks to pray for them (ie. an exam or something good to happen to them) what should we do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI know we are not allowed to pray for non-Muslims except ask Allah to guide them to the right path, but what should we tell them if they ask us to pray for them so that they may recieve a good grade or such?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not prohibited to make Du'aa for the success of a non-Muslim in any\nmatter that is not un-Islamic. The confidence placed by a non-Muslim in a\nMuslim should be embraced by applying wisdom and gradually inviting the\nperson to Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
