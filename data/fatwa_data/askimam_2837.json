  "question": "Can women be leaders in islam? If not can you give me the hadiths which backs it",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala says in the noble Qur'aan, 'Men are protectors of woman because%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala has given them more strength and because they support them from%0D%0Atheir means.' (Nisaa AAYAT34)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn this case, the word, 'protectors' refers to one who stands firm in%0D%0Aprotecting other's interests, looks after his affairs, business, etc. The%0D%0Acommentators of the noble Qur'aan have written under the abovementioned%0D%0Averse that Allah Ta'ala has chosen men and has given them virtue over women.%0D%0AWhilst men have many responsibilities to take care of, females also have%0D%0Aresponsibilities. The responsibility of men having authority over women is%0D%0Anot confined to only religious matters, but it is general and refers to any%0D%0Amatter, be it religious, political or with regard to any department, council%0D%0Aor organization. This authority for the male over the female does not%0D%0Abelittle the status of woman in the least bit.%0D%0A%0D%0ATo make us understand, the example of a male and female is like that of the%0D%0Ahead and the hand. Whilst the male being the head if the most important part%0D%0Aof the body and holds the most amount of respect and authority, this in on%0D%0Away whatsoever proves that the hand (woman) is useless and has no status in%0D%0Athe body. The matter about woman having more capabilities than men does not%0D%0Ahold much weight since the basis for the authority of men over women is not%0D%0Acapabilities, intelligence, wealth or any other material entity which can be%0D%0Aacquired.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe commentators have clearly stated that the virtue and authority that has%0D%0Abeen given to men is on the basis of their species, i.e. because they are%0D%0Amen. Hence, it is a great possibility that there are many women who have%0D%0Agreat potential, intelligence and wealth and seem to be more worthy for%0D%0Aleadership. However, Allah Ta'ala has, in his infinite mercy and wisdom,%0D%0Astipulated this position for men on the basis of them being men even though%0D%0Athey may at time lack in capabilities and expertise as compared to women.%0D%0A(Ma'ariful Qur'aan vol.2 pg.396; Deoband)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
