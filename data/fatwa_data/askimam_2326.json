  "question": "Are women really inferior to men?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIslam does not allow equal treatment to women, this is because she can be forced to sleep with her husband, refusing to sleep with him is a sin. But why isn?t this point looked at in a realistic way. If her husband forces her, then he will be the one enjoying it in bed, whilst she will find it a painful night. To enjoy it, ?both? need to seduce each other so that they ?both? produce a liquid, which will not result in painful intercourse. This is reality, so why isn?t this point included in the religion. Why should women have a painful night and men force them anytime they like. As I heard, there is no such thing a rape between wife and husband. But have you heard the stories of many women who say they had been raped by their husband, when the say they were tortured in bed, it was painful when they were not in the mood and forced into it. Islam doesn?t now allow punishment as such or does it? Please answer my question specifically, including all points.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs Islam has made it obligatory upon a women to answer the call of the husband to bed, so too are men advised to engage in foreplay before the actual act of intercourse takes place. The question of equality cannot be based on the act of intercourse or be viewed as the west will view equality ie. a woman must be able to do what a man can do.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
