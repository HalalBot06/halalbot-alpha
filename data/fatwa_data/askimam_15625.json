You do not have to give the car to the customer to test drive or take it to the mechanic. You may do so if you wish to. You should also state to the customer that you are selling the car and will not entertain any claim regarding the car after the sale.\n\n2.         Please view our answer to the 15th Shabaan posted here :\n http://www.askimam.org/fatwa/fatwa.php?askid=364e44a0299d009b501d22018dd451e6\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
