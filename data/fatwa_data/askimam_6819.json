  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn our Mosque, when we usually finish our fardh Salaat in congregation, the muazzin of nearby mosque calls Adhan and we can hear the Adhan clearly (through the loud speakers) .Should we give answer to the Adhan or should we skip the answer and pray our sunnah and witr Prayers?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is only necessary upon a person to reply to the first Adhaan he hears whether it is the Adhaan of his Musjid or not. It is not necessary to reply to the Adhaan of all the different Masaajid which are called at different times. (Tahtawi pg.110)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
