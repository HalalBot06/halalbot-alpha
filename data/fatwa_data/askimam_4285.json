  "question": "Assalamwalaykum, could you please answer a few questions that I have and interperate some of my dreams?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI fell asleep and in my dream I was riding a bike and suddenly I fell off the bike, (and in reality) I woke up my hands were sliding across my bed as if to brace myself from falling onto the concrete. And another dream that I had was similar to the last dream, I had just fallin asleep and in my dream I was face to face with a dragon, and just as it was about to breathe fire on me (in reality) I woke upto holding my arms infront of me to protect me from the fire. Now this next dream I felt evil after I woke up and not remembering what I even dreampt about until later that day, the dream was about me and a couple friends broke into a house to rob it, and then the owners of the house came home and when they entered their house my friends killed them, then we left and as we were driving away the cops passed us on there way to the crime scene and we got away. In the the Christian belief , they believe that jesus died and came back to life after 3 days, what makes the Christians believe that ? Because muslims believe that Allah took prophet Isa (p.b.u.h) to heaven, so what imposter said that he was jesus and returned from the dead ? and finally, a Christian asked me a few questions that I had trouble answering here they are- How does Allah help a person improve their moral character? And does Allah of Islam provide a person any supernatural help to fight their internal Jihad? I hope u will be able to answer these questions for me, And my Allah bless you all.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAll the dreams in reference do not have any significance. They are Shaytaani\ndreams and you should ignore them. Before sleeping recite Aayatul Kursi and\nthe four Quls, blow on your hands and pass your hands around your body.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nPs.
