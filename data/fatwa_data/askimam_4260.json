  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) If one is balig and it is nessecary for him to fast and he can't due to health problems, what can he do to make up for lost fasts other than paying Â£2.00 fitrana for everyday missed? 2) Does the blessed seed oil (Kalunji) have the ailment for curing diabetes?- and if it does then in what way must one consume it? 3) If it is haraam for one to donate an organ, is it haraam for one to accept it ? 4) Is there a minimum age for one to go to jihad?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person is unable to fast due to health reasons, he will be excused from%0D%0Afasting. If there is a possibility of him recovering, then he has to make%0D%0Aqadhaa (make up) for the missed fasts whenever he recovers. In such a%0D%0Asituation, there is no compensation for the missed fasts. That Fidya is only%0D%0Awhen one is permanently unable to fast. There is nothing more to be done%0D%0Abesides giving Fidya.%0D%0A2. We do not know%0D%0AKindly refer to our standard answer on organ transplant below.%0D%0AWhen a male is physically matured or he is at least 15 years of age, he%0D%0Aqualifies to participate in Jihaad.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AOrgan Transplant%0D%0AMany Islamic scholars and Jurists have written on the subject of organ%0D%0Atransplant. Over the decades, medicine has improved and advanced%0D%0Adramatically, taking medical technology to extreme heights.%0D%0AToday, through the vast medical advancement, almost any transplant of the%0D%0Ahuman body can be performed. Owing to the technological medical changes,%0D%0Aprominent and renowned jurists of the world have carefully analysed the%0D%0Aprocess of organ transplant and upon investigation made the following%0D%0Aobservations:%0D%0A1. When any person's limb or organ becomes unusable and that limb or organ%0D%0Ais needed to function in the future by a suitable replacement then the%0D%0Afollowing conditions must be considered.%0D%0A%0D%0AUse of a non-living component.%0D%0A%0D%0AUse the limb of those animals permissible to eat and slaughtered according%0D%0Ato the Islamic rites of slaughter.%0D%0A%0D%0AThere is almost certain fear of loss of life or danger of losing the%0D%0Alimb%2Forgan and the replacement is only found in Haraam animals or in%0D%0Apermissible animals (which can be eaten) but not slaughtered according to%0D%0AIslamic rites, then use of such a component will be permissible. However, if%0D%0Athere is no imminent danger of loss of life then it will not be permissible%0D%0Ato use anything from the pig.%0D%0A2. Similarly, a transplant of any nature whatsoever is permissible from one%0D%0Apart to another part of the body of the same person when necessary.%0D%0A3. The sale of any part of the human body is Haraam.%0D%0A4. If any ill person reaches a stage that a specific organ becomes unusable%0D%0A(to such an extent) that if a human organ is not replaced into the body then%0D%0Athere is an immediate danger of loss of life -- the human organ is the only%0D%0Asuitable replacement and medical experts are absolutely certain that besides%0D%0Athe human organ, there is no other life-saving substitute and the patients'%0D%0Alife is in danger, and the human organ is easily available to the patient,%0D%0Athen in that dire need a human organ transplant (to save one's life) will be%0D%0Apermissible for the sick.%0D%0A5. When a perfectly healthy person on the advice of an expert physician%0D%0Aconfirms that the removal of one kidney will not harm nor cause ill-health%0D%0Awhatsoever and considering the deteriorating health of his sick immediate%0D%0Afamily member which may cause death and there is no other alternate or%0D%0Asubstitute then this will be permissible with the condition that the kidney%0D%0Abe donated and not sold.%0D%0AThe bequest (Wasiyyat) of a person that after his death, his organs be%0D%0Adonated is forbidden in Shariah.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
