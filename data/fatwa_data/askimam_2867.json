  "question": "Does salaat al istikhara works when you are not neutral and could you get an answer even before you say the duaa?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSalaatul Istikhaara is performed when one is in a doubt and is unable to\nmake a decision.\n\nIf one has made a decision and is sure of it, then there is no need to\nperform Salaatul Istikhaara. One should be neutral during performing\nSalaatul Istikhaara. If one fears not being neutral, he/she may request\nanother person to perform Salaatul Istikhaara on his/her behalf.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
