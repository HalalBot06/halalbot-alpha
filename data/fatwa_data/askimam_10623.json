  "question": "TV sisters husband not praying salaah...My dad says that Maulana so and so keeps the TV in his house to watch the news so its allowed. What do I tell Them?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy sister prays her salaah five times daily and tries to do everything in accordance with islam, but her husband is not the same as her. He watches TV, doesn?t pray his namaaz etc. My sister told me about her problems she wanted to know a solution, what could she do to make her husband understand. She has three children and she doesn?t want them to be influenced by the TV which they already are, i.e. they?re already imitating whats on TV, she tells her kids not to watch TV and they listen but when her husband comes in he turns the TV on and she can?t do anything about it. Her husband is kind, patient and has a good character but my sister is very impatient and has got a temper so once she got really angry at him for not spending his Ramadhan properly. She got angry because she tells him but its not taking effect on him. Have you got a solution for her? I?ve quit TV and I don?t watch the news or anything but my family are continually watching TV, my dad says he just watches the news but my sister watches too much TV, Alhamdulillah, things have changed she turns the TV off when I come in. My dad says that Maulana so and so keeps the TV in his house to watch the news so its allowed. What do I tell Them?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMaashaAllah in today's day and age to abstain from watching T.V. is a great special bounty from Allah Ta'ala. As far as sister who does not watch T.V. whilst her husband does-MashaAllah the above applies to her too. However, in relationship to the family, tell her to resort to her Musalla (change anger) pour her heart out crying to Allah Ta'ala to give hidaayat and tufeeq to her husband and children and she too must make dua for steadfastness for herself. %0D%0A%0D%0AAlso change tactics. Start loving her husband and children more instead of just shouting. Example will be a tableegh on its' own just as your experience with your other sister. She must maintain control with children on watching T.V. However, fulfill that gap with halaal entertainment even if it means joining them encourage perphaps playing some game or postive, beneficial activities. It will take a bit of resistance or moaning but once settled in the children develop new positive habits.%0D%0A%0D%0AAlhumdulillah.buy some casettes with Arabic%2FUrdu%2FEnglish nazms which is very soothing and relaxing. Try and obtain some books and good literature which will stir interest all around . May Allah Ta'ala grant you and your sister staedfastness and make your path easy and help the rest of the family members and Ummah at large to give up sins. InshaAllah. Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0AWas Salaam%0D%0A%0D%0A2Social Dept.%0D%0A%0D%0AMashaAllah you too continue your efforts and make dua for your father and sister don't nag too much."
