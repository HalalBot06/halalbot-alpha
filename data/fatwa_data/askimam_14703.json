  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamu alaikum.\n\nI use glass paints to make calligraphies of Qur'anic ayaat on mirrors, tiles etc.  Recently, I came to know that alcohol is an ingredient of most of the glass paints, tint mediums etc that I use.  I do not know what type of alcohol these paints contain or whether it is \"najis\" or not.\n\n(1)  Could you please confirm that it is not allowed to use these paints for painting Qur'anic ayat?\n\n(2)  Is it permissible  to use these paints for the above purpose, if the alcohol contained in them is synthetic ?? \n\n(3)  What should I do about the calligraphies that I have already painted with these glass paints?\n\nJazakAllahu khairun\n\nSakinah\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n Muhtaram\n\n \n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\n \n\nIf the alcohol in the paints are synthetic, then it will be permissible. \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\nThe guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\nEducation and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\nIslam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\nWhen one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\nMuslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\nWe have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\nIf you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\nIf that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\nRasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit”. \n\n \n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUT INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
