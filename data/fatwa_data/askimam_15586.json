  "question": "Is it the ligitimate sons resposibility to look after this child ( he is 20 years of age ) or must he look after himself?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThe father had an affair and a child was born from this affair , the farther falls ill and cannot look after the illigitamate son.\n\nIs it the ligitimate sons  resposibility to look after this child ( he is 20 years of age ) or must he look after himself?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIn principle, when a person is fifteen years and older, he is regarded to be an adult in Shariah. An adult is responsible to take care of his own needs.\n\nHowever, if an adult experiences difficulties in fulfilling his needs, any assistance rendered to his will be an act of great virtue and reward.\n\nAs Muslims, our focus should not be on the rights but on the pleasure of Allah and reward.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
