  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAsalam o alikum! 1) I am quite sad nowadays regarding my husband. I don’t know but for some reason he does not show his love/feelings towards me. It has been happening for the past 1 year since I gave birth to my daughter. My husband is a very religious man, and I trust him 100 %. I have talked to him many times and complained that why does he not show his love towards me but he says that he does love me. His reaction hurts me a lot and sometime makes me think about another men (which is haram). I don’t know what to do? 2) As it has been mentioned in hadith that if a man calls his wife in bed and if wife denies then angels curse her till morning. What happens if wife calls her husband in bed and husband denies? looking forward to a quick response! wassalm mona\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:"
