  "question": "How to be sure if period has completely stopped & when to start prayers?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen should a woman start praying after her period stops? I know we are supposed to pray immediately after it finishes but sometimes it comes a after a day & then stops. Then how can we be sure when it has finished? My mother always says to wait 24 hrs (1 day) after it stops & then only to make ghusl & pray. I told her this may not be correct & we may have to pray qadha for the missed 24 hrs. She says we dont need to. What should I do? Please reply.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a female observes her full term of periods of 10 days, or observes a set pattern lesser than ten days, then she should take a bath and resume her Shari'ah obligations of performing Salaat immediately after the completion of ten days or upon completing her set pattern without any further delay.\n\nIf it is Ramadhan, then she should resume her Fardh fast. There should not be any further delay in resuming one's Shar'ee obligations. However, if a female is certain or almost certain that in the case of a set pattern of lesser than ten days, the bleeding will definitely resume within 24 hours due to her previous experience, then she may hold on as that will be regarded as a change in her monthly pattern. She cannot delay her bath and Shar'ee obligations without a sound reason.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
