Also can you read the above Du?a and other Du?as for your brother or sister to get married?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are many different duas one can make to get a pious spouse, amongst them:\n\"Rabbi Anzilni Munzalam Mubaarakan Wa Anta Khairul Munzileen\"\n\"Rabbana Aatinaa fid Dunya Hasanah Wa Fil Aakhirati Hasanah Waqinaa Azaaban Naar\"\n\nIt would be best if the person wanting to get married, himself read the dua, however you could make dua, even in english, for him to be granted a pious wife.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
