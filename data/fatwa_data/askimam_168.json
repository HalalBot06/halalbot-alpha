  "question": "What procedure must be used by a Muslim in choosing a compatible spouse?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a 27 year old Muslim. My parents would like me to go to India and get a wife. There are very few Muslimahs in this country. I find it very difficult to go to India and choosea wife when they are so many differences for instance I only speak english, the culture different plus I also fear that the girls there would only marry me for my status .\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'A woman is generally married\nfor four reasons; her wealth, status, beauty and priority. Successful is he\nwho made piety his criteria of marriage.'\n\nThat does not mean one should not consider the other three factors. However,\nthe piety of a female should be strongly considered as that quality is most\nrequired to make a happy home.\n\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
