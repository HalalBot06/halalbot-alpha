  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWe had a beautiful cat as our pet who we came really close to. Today we found him died, assuming he was run over by a car. We have buried him in our garden, but what i would like to know is whether we should read a dua for him or surah for him? If so, which one?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThere is no dua or any recitation to be made when burying the cat.\n\nHowever, the death of the cat should be a reminder of our death. We should be conscious of our death at all times. That will grant us the tawfeeq to\n\n1.       Make Tawba.\n\n2.       Be content with whatever we have.\n\n3.       Exert ourselves in Ibadat to prepare for life after death.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa\n\n \n\nImportant Posts and Links\n\n \n\nShar'ii stance on Shares and Stocks|Have you prepared your WILL??|Moonsighting - Its that time to sight the moon"
