  "question": "Deoband is similar to Wahhabi - true? they give bayans, talk about no need for worldly riches, speak of living like the Sahabah, and at the same time live in a mini-mansion and drive a Lexus on jamaat",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAlso I got on Tablighi Dawah jamaats, Al Hamdu lillah, on jamaat often times there are brothers that Allah SWT has made wealthy in this dunya. However they give bayans and talk about no need for worldly riches and speak of living like the Sahabah Akram, and at the same time live in a mini-mansion and drive a Lexus on jamaat. To me this seems to make no sense driving a new luxery car that is obviously a status symbol out on Jawla to tell brothers about the shortness of this life and how to prepare for the Herafter. My question is how to deal with brothers saying these things are made halal by Allah SWT so there is no problum in possesing them. How can I not be sucked into these brothers mentality that BMW isn't haraam so it is okay to own one? And how can I avoid being affected by these dunya things when I have to ride in them? Please give some advice, Inshallah. There is a hadith, I believe, that says something similar to if a person makes a fresh Wudu and then walks to the masjid with the intention being only to offer salat one virtue is added and one sin erased for every step made. I have heard quite a few times on jamaat that if a person makes a fresh wudu and drives a car to the masjid than somehow the amount of steps he would have taken in that distance he drove if he walked would be applicable to the above mentioned hadith, Is this true and if so how?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta?ala is the Creator and Sustainer of this world and everything that is found in this world. He has sent us to this world as a test and depending on how we live in this world will be the results in the hereafter.%0D%0A%0D%0AAll the material aspects of this world, car, house, business, etc. have been created in order for us to pass our temporary life in this world, hence, a necessity that is restricted to the world only. Shari?ah has allowed us to use all the permissible aspects of the world as long as it does not become a hindrance and obstacle for the Deen of Allah. In fact, it would be preferable to make use of these means if it would be promoting and assisting the cause of Deen.%0D%0A%0D%0AAlso, there is no harm in using any of the luxuries of this world if Allah has provided them for you. However, these should not become the priorities of our life and the love of these should not enter our hearts. Preference should always be given to Deen. We should reflect on the reality of these worldly possessions. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?When a person dies, then three things accompany him; his wealth, family and actions. Two of these return to the world and only one of these accompany him to the everlasting journey from the Qabr onwards, and that is his actions.? (Mishkaat pg.440)%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen you see any of the bounties of Allah on any Muslim brother, you should be happy for him. One should not judge whether he has love of the world or not. %0D%0A%0D%0AThe Hadith has been narrated by Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Should I not show you that through which Allah Ta?ala wipes out your sins and raises your status?? Sahaaba replied, ?Yes Indeed, O, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).? Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Completing your Wudhu despite the difficulties, taking extra steps to the Musjid and waiting for one Salaat after another. The reward of these actions is similar to the one who is guarding the borders of an Islamic state.? (Mishkaat pg.38)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe original virtue mentioned is for the footsteps. However, this could also apply to a person traveling by car as well since the treasures of Allah Ta?ala are vast and Allah is the most rewarding.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0Afor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
