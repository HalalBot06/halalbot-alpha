  "question": "I did istikaarah for marriage and i had the following dream",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI saw myself sitting with my aunts and cousins all laughing and in a happy mood in a previous home which i lived in. They were all going to eat lunch and told me to come but i told them i couldn't because i was waiting on the person who had proposed. Does this indicate I should go ahead and say yes? Jazakallahu Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream is a positive sign to accept the proposal.\n\nHowever, if you have any reservations, you should continue with the\nIstikhaara until you are sure and have satisfaction of the heart. You should\nalso make Mashwara (seek guidance) of your elders in the matter.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
