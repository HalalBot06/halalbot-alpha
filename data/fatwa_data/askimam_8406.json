  "question": "very bad opinion about tablighi ...If one books (fadhail-e-amal) is stopping people from doing tabligh then maybe the ulama should not use this book in talim and use a book everyone can agree with",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome people limit this opinion to the ?salafis? and that kind of bothers me because salafis also give dawah. A lot of people wont do this work it seems because of he fadhail-e-amal and the fact that Indians and Pakistanis dominate tablighi jamaat. If one books (fadhail-e-amal) is stopping people from doing tabligh then maybe the ulama should not use this book in talim and use a book everyone can agree with. Also I don?t understand why people hold these Sufis and saints in such high regard and built elaborate structures on there grave . If more people would follow the six points that success in this life and the hereafter are in following the commandments of Allah subhana wa at ala and sunnah of rasullullah(saw) then inshallah everyone will listen. But I think there is a lot of reforming to be done in tablighi jamaat and more people should become alims so that they know if what there doing is bidah or not. Also could you tell me what kind of talim they had in masjid nabi (saw).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe emphasis in Da?awah and Tabligh is to revive Deen in a person?s life. To remind a person of his purpose of life, to be obedient to Allah and conscientise him of death, life after death and accountability in the court of Allah. This is what is meant by basic Shari?ah.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf the above mentioned aspects are in a Muslim?s life, that will create an urge in him to learn Deen, to be a Haafiz or an Aalim. His faith will be strong enough for him to sacrifice a few years to go to an educational institute to study Deen in depth and work towards implementing that in one?s community and environment. It is not expected of a person spending few months in Tabligh to be discussing the laws of Shari?ah. That is the work of scholars. Alhamdulillah, in many parts of the world, there are many Ulama who are the products of the effort of Da?awat and Tabligh. They or their parents have been conscientised on Deen and that led them to go abroad and spent 8%2F10 years away from home. Now they are leading Ulama in their communities doing invaluable work of establishing and spreading the Deen of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0APs. The writer himself is a product of Da?awah and Tabligh%0D%0A"
