  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) After the expiry of parents what all the things to be done in order to get magfirat for them. My father is not a regular praying person. I constantly used to say him to read the 5 times prayers, he forcibly goes to the masjid, he is aged now and many times he ignores the fardh salats. When he passes away what needs to be done by me so that without any punishment from Allah he reaches directly to jannah. 2) I m 29 yrs old now, started offering 5 times prayers since last 4yrs. I havent read my salats from childhood till 25 yrs but I used to offer only Jumma salats in those days. Alhamdulillah I hve performed many umrahs during these 4 yrs and also did my hajj last year. I heard from elders that if u pray atleast two rakats in Makkah - it equals to one hundred thousand rakats. Will it suffice my all of the qadha salats from childhood till 25 yrs OR I need to offer all the qadha salats for 25 yrs. Jazakallahu khair for your answers\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Your efforts behind your father is encouraging. May Allah Ta?ala grant you wisdom and steadfastness, Aameen.\n\nYou should continue your efforts behind your father with wisdom until he is alive. Try and get Ulama and pious people to meet your father and offer him advices. If possible, have meals with him and choose a Kitaab and read few advices and Ahadith before meals. We suggest you get Fadhaail-e-Aamal of Shaykh Zakariyya (RA) or any other reliable literature with advices. Use every possible opportunity to encourage your father and also be of service to him whenever he requires you.\n\n2. Whatever Salaats you have missed, it is compulsory for you to make Qadhaa of them. The virtues of performing Salaats in the Haram will not compensate for the missed Salaats.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
