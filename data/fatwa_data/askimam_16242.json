  "question": "In Maghrib and Isha salah where the imam does qirat in first two rakats. While in the rest rakat imam does not do qirat with voice. In those rakats i tend to loose my attention",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAlthough core purpose to offer Salah is to please and fullfill Commandment of ALLAH SWT. But my question is that in the Farz namaz prayed with Jammat namaz.\n\nIn Maghrib and Isha salah where the imam does qirat in first two rakats. While in the rest rakat imam does not do qirat with voice. In those rakats i tend to loose my attention towards allah and my thoughts are dissarray and all over the place.\nON this ground can i say surah fatiha behind imam in which imam does not do qirat with voice to maintain my full attention towards Allah SWT. also same question stands for zuhr and asar prayers.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is not permissible for a muqtadee (follower) to recite behind the imam in both audible and silent prayers, as the recitation of the imam is sufficient for the follower.\n\nAllah Ta'ala says in the Holy Quran:\n\nوإذا قرئ القرآن فاستمعوا له وأنصتوا لعلكم ترحمون\n\n\"And when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and remain silent, so that you may receive mercy.\" [i.e. during the compulsory congregational prayers when the imam is reciting] (7:204)\n\nThere are also several hadith reported relating to this matter. Hereunder are a few of them:\n\n1) Abu Saeed Khudri (Radiyallahu Anhu) relates:\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) delivered a sermon in which he outlined our way (sunnah) for us and taught us our prayer. He instructed: When you prepare for prayer, straighten your rows; then one of you lead the others in prayer. When he proclaims the takbir you also proclaim it; when he recites remain silent; and when he reaches \"ghayril maghdubi alayhim waladdallin,\" say \"amin,\" and Allah will answer your prayer. (Sahih Muslim, Vol. 1, P. 173, Rashidiyya)\n\n2) Abu Hurayra (Radiyallahu Anhu) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said:\n\nThe imam has been assigned to be followed. When he proclaims the takbir you also proclaim it. When he recites remain silent. And when he says \"sami Allahu liman hamidah,\" say Rabbana lakal hamd\". (Sunan Abi Dawud, Vol. 1, P. 96, Multan)\n\n3) Imaran Ibn Husayn (Radiyallahu Anhu narrates:\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) was performing the zuhr prayer when a person behind him began to recite \"Sabbih isma rabbik al-a'la\". Upon completing his prayers, the Prophet (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) asked who it had been. The person identified himself, so the Prophet (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) remarked: I thought one of you was taking it (the verses) from my tongue. (Sahih Muslim, Vol. 1, P. 172, Rashidiyya)\n\n4) Jabir (Radiyallahu Anhu) narrates that whoever prays behind an imam, his imam's recitation is sufficient for him. (Mussannaf Ibn Abi Shayba, Vol. 1, P. 377, Dar Al-Salafiyya)\n\nThe above verse and hadiths are clear proof for the prohibition of reciting behind the imam. However, it will be permissible to recite Quran or any zikr in the heart without moving the lips in the rakats which are inaudible behind the imam. Our advice is that you make the zikr of Allah Ta'ala in your heart and concentrate on the greatness of Allah. It takes self-training to attain full attention and devotion in salat. InshaAllah this method will keep your mind focused in prayer.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Asif Umar,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
