  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs salam vallekum. Recently I convert to ISLAM.I want to know Is video editing work is permitted in islam.Though music is haram and videoediting is for movies then weather my income will be halal or haram. I am in INDIA and everyone said that no matters it is a harbi kaafir country.IF I will do this course it is inderctly related to movies.is ta a sin or not to such kind of job.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\n \n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\nWe are delighted to know about you accepting Islām.  This is a great bounty of Allāh upon you.  May Allāh Ta’āla further guide you and may He keep you steadfast. Amīn.\n\n \n\nComing into Islām may have brought an immense change in your lifestyle, from waking up early in the morning for Salāh and fasting in the month of Ramadhān to staying away from evil and vices.  The point of satisfaction is that all these adjustments are made in pursuit of the truth to please Allāh Ta’ālā and finally meet Allāh Ta’ālā on the Day of Judgement with correct and true beliefs. \n\n \n\nYou have righty stated that music and photography are impermissible in Islām.   While we acknowledge that this may be another challenge to adjust to, we also accept the fact that   bringing complete Dīn in one’s life is not an overnight process.  An individul’s Imān and faith in Allāh Ta’ālā must be strengthened. Gradually total Dīn starts to fall into place, especially after educating yourself more about Dīn and its hidden beauties.  Once you educate yourself, the Imān in the heart and brain solidifies making it easier for you to conform to the dictates of Sharīah.   May Allāh strengthen us all in our faith and practices.  Amīn.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Abdul Azeem bin Abdur Rahman,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\nUS\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
