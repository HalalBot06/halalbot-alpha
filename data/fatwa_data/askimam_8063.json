  "question": "i would like to ask if my wife is living with someonelse and comiting adultry is it a solid ground for divorce how should i do it pllz tell tell me in the light of quran and sunnah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe wife having an extra marital affair does not invalidate your Nikah. The extra marital affair is Haraam and a major sin which incurs the wrath and curse of Allah.\n\nWe suggest you speak to your wife and clarify the issue with him. However, you should use a diplomatic approach rather than an accusative one. You should try to consult the seniors of both (yours and his) families in trying to resolve your predicament.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
