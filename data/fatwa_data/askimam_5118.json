  "question": "Are MUNAMUL and MOTIUL included in 99 names of ALLAH?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn one book I found these names included and total names given are 102 but in all other books these names are not included.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has said that a person who memorises the\n99 names of Allah Ta'ala will be guaranteed entrance into Jannat. This does\nnot mean that there are only 99 names for Allah Ta'ala. Allah Ta'ala has\nmany other names.\n\nThe correct pronunciation of the first name that you have mentioned is\n'al-Mun'im' which is one of the names of Allah Ta'ala although not includes\nin the famous 99 names. The second name is 'al-Mu'tee'. This is a name of\nAllah Ta'ala and according to one narration it is also included in the 99\nnames.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
