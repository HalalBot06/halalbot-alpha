  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamoalikum,\n\nA man of about 53 years of age has the following question:\n\n' I am living in Austria. I dont have a regular job, so I go to work as soon as some job is available. These days it is also difficult to find a work. This year in Ramadan , I will be on work. The conditions are a little hard for me to keep the 'fasting'. In such case can I go for ' Kaffarah ' and keep abstain from fasting? '\n\nJazakAllah khair\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf you are able to fast, then it is fardh (compulsory) upon you to fast. You cannot skip the fast and pay kaffarah.\n\nWe make dua to Allah to give you the strength and courage to fast. If you are determined, Allah will make it easy for you, Ameen.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
