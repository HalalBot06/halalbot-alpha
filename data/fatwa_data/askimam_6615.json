  "question": "I want to spent time in Medina in Ramadan. My friend is asking to go in Jamath and leave family at home and he will look after them and he will keep his wife at my home (presently I am in Saudi).",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it allowed to do so from shariath point of view?(inviting to islam)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour question is unclear. Are you requiring the permissibility of going out\nin Jamaat?\n\nIf so, then, we wish to advise you that going out in Jamaat is a noble work\nand a great Sunnah of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and all the\nprophets. Every prophet of Allah invited their people to believe in Allah\nand in the Oneness of Allah. Hadhrat Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu) said, 'If one\nperson is guided through you, that is better than red camels (most\nprestigious commodity of that time)\n\nYou should consult a senior person, preferably an Aalim who is actively\nengaged in Tabligh. He will advise you according to your personal\ncircumstances. The seniors in Da'awah and Tabligh encourage people to go out\nin the path of Allah, but also take into cognizance one's personal\ncircumstances as well.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
