  "question": "Wudhu with glitter on the body",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nQno1: I have a problem regarding  qirat pronunciation during namaz..I  feel that I am not pronouncing HA (HA like in subhanALLAh or ALHumdullilah or MOhammad) properly. So I use to repeat again and again the same word and still I donot  get satisfied  oftenly. It disturbs me a lot . plz guide should I  say the word only once and then leave it to Allah that it will be okey. Because repeating it again and again is very difficult.\n\n \n\n \n\nQno 2:. I want to ask performing WuDhu with glitter on our body is correct or not.? There are two types of glitter one is broad which can be easily seen..and the other one which I am talking about is so thin and small that u can hardly see them but they r on your hand and face.Oftenly I get to know that Oh there was a glitter on my hand  when i am finished with my prayers. Then sometimes I repeat my namaz thinking that my wudhu must not be correct with glitter and sometimes I leave it.\n\n\n\n\nSo  concluding I WANT TO ASK THAT PERFORMING WUDHU WITH SUCH SMALL AND THIN GLITTER WHICH U CAN HARDLY SEE IS CORRECT OR NOT ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\n1) It is good to know how concerned you are regarding the correct pronunciation of the words of the Holy Qurān. Time should be taken out during the day to practice and to perfect the pronunciation of each letter. However, there is no need for you to repeat every word multiple times in Salāh in order to pronounce the letter correctly. The correct Makhraj of Haa is the centre of the throat.\n\nRasulullah (sallallāhu alaihi wasallam) said:\n\n“An expert (in the recitation) of the Qurān will be amongst the pious and noble scribes, and the one who stutters and recites Qurān whilst it is difficult upon him will receive double reward (i.e. for reciting and for the effort).\n\n(Sahih Muslim, Vol.1 , Pg.269 ,Deoband)[1]\n\n2) If the glitter is such that you are certain that water has not penetrated or wet the area beneath, wudhu will be incomplete. The glitter will have to be removed and the dry area should be washed. If Salāh was performed before washing this area, that Salāh will have to be repeated.\n\n(Marāqil Falāh, Pg.63, Ilmiyya)\n(Bahisti Zewar, pg.52, Zam Zam)\n\nHowever, you are certain that the area beneath the glitter did get washed, the wudhu and the Salāh will be correct.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n\n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftāa\n\n6 Sep 2010\n\n\n\n\n[1] عن عائشة قالت قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم  الماهر بالقرآن مع السفرة الكرام البررة والذي يقرأ القرآن ويتتعتع فيه وهو عليه شاق له أجران (باب فضيلة حافظ القرآن)"
