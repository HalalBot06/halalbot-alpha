  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaam Alaikum Mufti sahab. I had a dream in which I saw my younger brother and sister's Quran instructor sitting and talking to me. He was praising his daughter for being so good and religious and all. Then he said to me that she would be a great partner for me if I accept (ie he was proposing for his daughter to me). What does this dream indicate?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMarriage is a major step in life and you should be careful in making any\ndecision in that regard. You should also make Istikhaara and seek Allah's\nguidance in the matter.\n\nYou should discuss the dream with your parents and seek their advise in the\nmatter.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
