  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nHow can we reconcile between the fact that an Ultrasound machine is able to reveal the gender of the foetus and the following verse of the Qur’aan, ‘and (only) He (Allah) Knows that which is in the wombs.’ (Luqmaan 31:24)?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah Ta’ala says in the noble Qur’aan that the knowledge of five things is only by Allah. Among them, one is, ‘And He knows what is in the wombs.’ (Luqmaan 31:24) The Arabic alphabet ‘maa’ is Ism Mo’sool (relative pronoun) which indicates generality (Umoom). The verse does not restrict the knowledge of Allah in respect to the foetus or any one aspect, e.g. gender and it is not confined to the condition of only one womb. It also includes the womb of every pregnant female. Surely, there is no machine that is able to reveal at once the condition of every pregnant female of the past, present and future till the day of Qiyaamat. That is certainly known only to Allah Ta’ala.\n\nFurthermore, the generality includes the actual time of being conceived, the different stages of the foetus and its consequences, miscarriage, etc., the faith of the child, being obedient or not, rich or poor, healthy or ill, life span, etc. All that is known only to Allah Ta’ala.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
