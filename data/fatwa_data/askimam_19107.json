  "question": "I have a few questions about ghusl, wudhu, and periods.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1.) If a woman got her period before she could take a ghusl for marital relations, should she have two different ghusls or would one suffice?\n\n2.) Is it necessary to perform ghusl before having sehri in Ramadan?\n\n3.) You have said that going before a non-mahram invalidates wudhu because it is a sin and watching tv does not when even that is a sin. Please clarify.\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\n1.) If a woman got her haidh before she could take a ghusl for marital relations, then she has a choice. Either she can take a ghusl at that time and another one when she is purified from her haidh, or she may delay her ghusl until she becomes purified from her haidh.  One ghusl taken at that time would then suffice for both instances.[i]\n\n\n2.) No,  it's not necessary to perform ghusl before having Suhoor (pre-dawn meal) in Ramadan.[ii] However, caution demands that one should take a ghusl at the earliest convenience to avoid delaying the Fajr Salah.\n\n\n3.) We are not aware of which answer you are referring to, but going before a non-mahram does not invalidate wudhu and neither does wudhu break by touching a non-mahram according to the Hanafi madhab. However, it is a sin to do so.[iii]\n\n\n\n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMl.
