  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn specific where the employee earns a monthly salary to work 5 days a week, but the employee leaves early and comes late in the mornings as a result of he has not much work to do ie. once he finishes his work he goes home although working hours are from 8am to 4pm. Is the employee in breach of shariah even if he expliained the situation to the employer? Also is he in breach if his salary is not equivalent to his tasks done (ie receives alot for little work)?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn the enquired case, there are two aspects: time and work. If the employee\nis hired for both, time and work, he cannot leave before 4 p.m. without the\nprior consent of his employer.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
