  "question": "The Prophets Sunnat of not shaking hands with women",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaam Sheikh, I practice the sunnah of not shaking hands with women, but in this day & age it seems to cause more trouble than benefit. I have lost many a job in interviews when I refuse to shake hands with women. I am now stuck in a job which has little or no prospects & i work 12hr shifts. I lost a previous job which had good career opportunitys & easy hours as a result. I explained to the women why I didnt shake hands that it was my religion without going into detail. Even when i started my current job I was introduced to a woman in my team & i did not shake hands although other muslims working here did! I explained why i didnt do it as politely as I could but she still takes it as an offence or saying that women arent good enough in Islam! the other muslims here dont even know Rasuula-salaam did not shake hands. If I insha'Allah get another job interview & a woman is present Im afraid that by not shaking her hand i will loose my job. Im trying to please Allah but look how worse of I am by doing this. Ive been told that i'll be rewarded insha'Allah in the next life but I dont want to be stuck in this job as the long shift work make it hard for me to have Kushoo i prayers, & as I work nights I sometimes miss Jummah through sleeping in the day. Why would Allah put me in this situation for trying to follow The Rasuul? Would I be in grave sin if I shook hands to better my chances of success in my interview? shukraan.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMay Allah Ta'ala reward you for having concern for your Deen. We have%0D%0Aunderstood your predicament and have the following advise for you:%0D%0A1. One should never please any person by causing the displeasure of Allah%0D%0ATaala. By shaking hands with females you are definitely flouting the law of%0D%0AShariah and hence displeasing Allah Taala.%0D%0A2. Allah Taala is All-Loving and never puts any person through undue%0D%0Adifficulties, trials and tribulations without any wisdom.%0D%0A3. Allah Taala has given us a divine Shariah whose laws are:%0D%0Aa) applicable till the Day of Qiyaamah;%0D%0Ab) truly beneficial to the one who abides by it; and%0D%0Ac) a definite safety measure, by practicing on any law of Shariah one will%0D%0Anever be harmed in any way.%0D%0A4. One should remain steadfast on the shariah and not succumb to the%0D%0Adictates of one's nafs by beginning to shake hands with females.%0D%0A5. You should strive to acquire a more suitable job than your present one,%0D%0Asince you are unable to attend Jumuah Salaat at times due to becoming%0D%0Aexhausted.%0D%0A6. You should have faith and trust in the fact that Allah provides our%0D%0Asustenance and true Barakah can only be gained from one's earnings if it is%0D%0Aacquired in a manner that pleases Allah Taala.%0D%0A7. Your concept of becoming successful in your interviews by shaking hands%0D%0Awith females is in reality a false concept and is in fact a deception of%0D%0Ashaitaan.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
