  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nHow should the intention before the beginning of a prayer be made? Do we say it inside our heads or outloud? What do we say?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nIt is not necessary to make a verbal intention. If a person knows in his heart that he is reading the fardh of fajr for today, or if it is a sunnah, then he is reading the sunnah of fajr for today,  this will be sufficient.\n\nIf a person wishes to make a verbal intention, it is sufficient to say: I am making intention for todays fardh or todays sunnah of fajr behind so and so Imam.                                                                                                \n\n (Bahishti Zewar Pg 146-Zam Zam)\n\n(Fataawa Mahmudiya V5 Pg-505 Faruqiya)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
