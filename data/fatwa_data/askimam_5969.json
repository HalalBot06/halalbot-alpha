  "question": "Question About Masterbation and viewing of Private Parts of both partners.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-O-Alakum, Molana Sahib. I have a couple of questions about the relationship of husband and wife in islam. 1. I had seen on your site that it is stated that wife and husband must have to hide their private parts from each other while in the intercourse or simply they don't have to look at each other's private parts. I want to know that how it is possible for a man and a woman to do this while intercourse depends upon the actions of private parts of both. 2. This is a question about masterbating. I had rad on your site that masterbation is prohibited but I had also read that a man can do it in the manner that he can tell her wife to do taht for him. I mean to say that he is not using his own hand but her wife's hand for the same action. So it is allowed in the second case. Is this true. 3. If the answer of the question number 2 is possitive and it is allowed then what about the prohibition of looking private parts of each other. Wife can do this for her man but she never see it, how it is possible. Please give me the answers ASAP because I am just going to marry so I must know what is legal and what is not. JazakAllah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There are two aspects to your query; a) Permissibility, b) Morality.\nIslam encourages morality. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said,\n'Imaan and shame are companions. When one is lifted, the other is also\nlifted.' We are encouraged to display modesty during intimate relationships.\nIt is immodest for the husband and wife to look at one another's private\nparts.\n2. It is permissible for the husband and wife to arouse one another by\ncaressing the sensitive organs of one another.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
