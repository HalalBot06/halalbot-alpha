  "question": "I didn't make my salat nor my fast, can I nourish the poor to compensate? (In order to obtain forgiveness) If so how many poor people by year? If not do I have to fast for these years, now?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI left Burundi, where I had live with my family, in 1973. Afterwards I came to study in Canada and lived in a catholic religious community (Les Pères du Très Saint Sacrament) because it is them who helped me to pay my studies. So they nourished and placed me on their premises for free. When I had finished my studies, I began to work here in Canada. Then I went back to Burundi to marry a girl from our premises, therefore a Muslim woman. We both returned to live in Canada and we had children. Since 1973 I lived in Canada, I went to Africa and in Mild-East (4-5 weeks each time) for some occasions or on holidays. For a while I didn't practise my religion and did not make my Salat or fast during the month of Ramadhan. For the following reasons: idleness, ignorance and foolishness of the adolescence. I was convincing my self that it's impossible to fast and do salat here in Canada and manage to work well and study well. Each time I would tell myself that I will fast during my holidays, but when the holidays came I wouldn't. Now, I practice my religion, (salat and fasting) Alhamdilillah. I was in Umrah and I did my Hajj (Alhamdilillah). I regret a lot the fact that I didn't practice my religion before and I will try to compensate. I would ask you to pray for me in order to obtain forgiveness and tell me how I can compensate. I would also like to thank you for your concern and may Allah guide me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou should calculate the number of Salaats you missed and make them up. This can be easily done by making it a practice that after every Fardh Salaat, make Qadhaa (read the Fardh) of the first Salaat of that type on your head, e.g. After Dhuhr, read 4 Rakaats Qadhaa of the first Dhuhr on your head, similarly after Asr, etc.\n\nYou should also calculate the number of fasts you missed and keep them. As long as you are not very old and weak, feeding the poor will not suffice.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
