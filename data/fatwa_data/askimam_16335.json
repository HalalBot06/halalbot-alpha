  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamualikum,\n\n My question is with regards to the Adab of Mosque/ Mussalah. We have a small mussalah in our suburb. At our mussalah, the work of dawah is going very well. We are trying to participate in five amal. Among the five amal, one of the amal is talim in the mosque. My question is regarding this subject. After every salat, we do some talim. During the talim, we see that some of the brothers who joined the jamat late, they are still praying their fardth salat.\n\nAnd also, some brothers are praying their sunnah. what should we do? do we need to wait for those brothers? or start the talim immediately after the salat? Does this act effact salat of the other muslim brothers? Whether we become sinners or not? Same problem arises, when make \"allan\" for jula or Gasth. These kind of questions are killing for years. Personally, I have realised this problem. Because, sometimes I catch the jamat little late. Before finishing my salat, \"allan'' or \"talim\" starts. Then it become to hard to concentrate on the salat.\n\nSometimes, I can not join the talim because I have to go to my jobs. Therefore, I have to pray sunnah quickly. As the place is not too big, i can hear the sound. Sometimes loose my concentration in my rest of the salat. Plz help me out. Give any reference of hadith or quran regarding this.\n\nJazakallah Kharian\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nTalim in the mosque/musallah is also among the aadat of the mosque/musallah. It was the noble habit or Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) to teach the Sahaba in the masjid. The Sahaba would also conduct Talim in groups in the musjid. Talim in the musjid falls in the category of inhabiting the musjid. Allah says, “Verily those people who bring Ieman on Allah and the hereafter inhabit the masaajid of Allah”.\n\nIt is also from the aadab of the musjid to be considerate to fellow musallies. One should not do anything that will inconvenience fellow musallis. The talim in the musjid could be conducted in a way that avoids inconveniencing fellow musallis by doing the Talim after the sunnats of salat in an area of the musjid where generally nobody performs salah.\n\nThe announcement of Jawla is generally made after salah. If this is delayed, the purpose of the announcement will be defeated. People will not know about the jawla and will go away. The only resolve in this is the late comers be tolerant and keep in mind the greater benefit for the ummah in the announcement. Inshallah, the reward for the tolerance will be greater than the concentration in the salah. The distraction through such an announcement will not decrease one’s sawab.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
