  "question": "Which Masjid should he give the Sadaqah to?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n-My grandad lives in Pakistan\n\n-There are 2 mosques in the village, and Mosque 1 is complete but there is no minaar there yet, but the mosque is ready for the imam to lead namaaz, and the minaar is not necessary.\n\n-Mosque 2 is still being built but because of financial difficulties is only half complete.\n\nMy Grandad has some money which he was going to donate for the minaar on mosque 1, but because it is mostly complete and can do without a minaar he is thinking that he should rather give his money to Mosque 2 so they can complete the building and get the mosque ready to read namaz in.\n\nThe question is where should my grandad give his money, and also if he was to give it to mosque 2 would it be right according to sharia law, as the money was initially intended for the minaar on mosque 1.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nSince he is the rightful owner of his wealth, he may donate to either of the two masjids.\n\nHowever, since masjid 2 is more in need of his funds, it would be more appropriate to donate to masjid 2 to enable the musallees to complete the masjid.\n\nAlthough, he intended to donate to the minarah of masjid 1, he may change his intention and donate to masjid 2.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
