  "question": "plz interpret..Dreams of Mullah Omar and Umar bin Al-Khattab",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nplz interpret these dreams for me.. As a child, I saw Umar bin Al-Khattab in my dream. I saw him walking towards me with a serious/intimidating expression on his face. He was wearing a long white jubbah (made of a towel-like material), with a rope for a belt. On his left shoulder he was carrying a bundle of the same white cloth, to sell (for trading). When I woke up from this dream, I had a high fever that ran for 3 days, during which I was very delirious. It was only after my fever that I remembered the dream. My other dream was about a month ago? I saw Mullah Omar in my dream. He had been \"poisoned\" by the enemy, but not the traditional poison we think of..somehow they had gotten to him on the \"inside\", penetrated him. I saw him \"die\" in front of me (though not literally). It was almost as if his body and mind were giving up the fight, against his wishes. First I saw that his body was \"dying/defeated\", which was then followed by his mind (menetally) , and then finally he was \"dying/defeated\" psychologically. One by one, all the components of his being ?died? (gave up). He was in a lot of pain, though not physical pain. It seemed as if he was hurt emotionally, he was pained that his body and mind had given up despite of himself (because the enemy had gotten to him from the inside). This was a very disturbing dream, I woke up in mental agony. Plz interpret, JazakAllah Kheir\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n..."
