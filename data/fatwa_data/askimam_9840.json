It is advisable for the spouses to be with one another immediately after Nikah. Separation between the spouses after Nikah, especially for lengthy periods of time, is against the purpose and spirit of performing Nikah.\n\nNevertheless, a separation of any time period between the spouses does not have any bearing on the validity of the Nikah. The Nikah will still be valid and intact.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
