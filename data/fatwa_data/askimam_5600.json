  "answer": "QUESTION\nmy sister, had got divorced, she sat in iddat for the required period, after her iddat, she made nikah to Mr X, MR X refused to consumate the marraige and gave her talaaq 3 days after the nikaah was performed. Is it still compulsory for her to sit in iddat? please advice. jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA divorcee is dutybound to observe the Iddah (waiting period) only if she\nexperiences Khalwate Saheeha with her ex-husband. (Hidaaya vol.2 pg.326).\nKhalwat-e-Saheeha is the husband and wife were in privacy, that there was no\nShar'ee obstacle preventing them from intimate relations.\n\nThe Shar'ee obstacles which may prevent the privacy from becoming\nKhalwat-e-Saheeha are, a) The woman is experiencing her monthly menses, b)\nOne of the spouses are offering an obligatory fast, c) One of the spouses\nare in condition of Ihraam. However, if Khalwat-e-Saheeha was experienced\nbut the spouses did not have any intimate relationship, then too Iddah is\nnecessary.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
