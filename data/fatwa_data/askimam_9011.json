  "answer": "QUESTION\nI want to ask about AL-IKHWAN group, which is most active now a days in Pakistan. Their Peer (leader) is Moulana Akram Awan Sahib who also speeches on Pakistan T.V. about Islam who is KHALEEFA of Late Allah Yar Sahib. Their main center is in CHAKWAL (Pakistan). Their main aim is to spread Islam by ZIKR. The method of their ZIKR is that they all sit in rows, put off lights and collectively do ZIKR of ALLAH-HU by NOSE. They create a voice from nose like SOO SOO and they say that we are saying ALLAH-HU. They also say that we are Deoband. Some of their people also criticize on Tableeghi brothers too much. Some Ullamas of Deoband here in Pakistan rejects them while some accepts them. Is this type of ZIKR is proven from Quran or Hadith. I want your Fatwa about them.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou state some Ulama accept the al-Ikhwaan group and others reject them. What difference will my ruling make? Your question is specifically regarding their form of Dhikr.\n\nIn my opinion, that is a secondary issue. The Aqaaid and philosophy of the group is of utmost importance. If there are any shortcomings regarding their Aqaaid or philosophy, then the question on Dhikr is insignificant as no form of Dhikr is acceptable in that state. Kindly inform us the Aqaaid of the al-Ikhwaan group. We do, however, disagree with the representatives of the group appearing on TV and offering speeches of Islam through that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
