  "question": "what is the status of \"balance transfer fee\" in Islam.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1: I live in usa. And I use credit cards. Some credit cards offer 0% APR for some months or a year. IT means no interest for that period. So I have taken that offer but when now this period is near to end. But I can't pay off the full balance and will have to pay interest on it. Now i recieved the offer from another credit card that they are giving me extra time for paying balance back without interest. But they say that they will charge me 60$ fee. This fee is for transfering balance from other credit card to this one. And they call it \"balance transfer fee\". I want to make sure that is this ok, or this is also another name of interest. 2: I am going to travel on plane next month. Will you tell me how to read my salaah in the plane. 3: Is it permissable in Islam to see a \"Cricket Match\" on TV.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. This balance transfer fee seems like a service fee for a service rendered. Hence, permissible.\n\n2. If possible, perform your Salaat standing at the back or front of the aircraft ? depending on the availability of space. If this is not possible, perform it in your seat whilst seated. Thereafter, repeat the Salaat when you land as a precautionary measure.\n\n3. No, it is not permissible to watch any sport on TV.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI"
