  "answer": "QUESTION\nAre these valid debts and repayable according to shariah? what should I do? It?s been very hard to ask you my questions. Forgive me for they are long. 1) What if you can?t remember who you owe money to or if it?s hard to contact company you owe due to no references, letters, etc..In the case of me not paying phone bills intentionally, this was 5-6 years ago. 2)Also I had a credit card, exceeded limit, payed back what I could, there is still money to be paid but bank has stopped hassling me, no more letters or anything, this is the case with a few catalogue companies, I also stole a lot of money once 2. 3) Finally I was involved in an accident where I had no insurance, they are now telling me to pay them several thousands for damage, compensation, etc.. I have no job and im not well off. Alhamdulillah Allah has put it in my heart to pay back what I owe, I just need to know how to go about it, and if all these are repayable? please be specific and tell in detail as it is important for my Akhirah!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. You should employ your discretion and determine how much you are owing\nand to whom. Thereafter, make an effort to pay them out.\n2. The same would apply here as well. You should try and pay them whatever\nyou owe.\n3. Islamically you are only liable for the cost of the damages and not\nanything beyond that.\n4. You must try and pay whatever you can even if it means paying a very\nsmall sum at a time. The idea is to at least try.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
