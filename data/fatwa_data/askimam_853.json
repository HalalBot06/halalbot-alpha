  "question": "What does the Quar'an say about having a Girl Friend? Is Arranged marrige the only way to get married?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Álaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nEvery type of premarital relationship, even if it excludes sexual relationship is prohibited.\n\nAnd Allah Taãla Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nWe do not understand what you mean by arranged marriage.\n\nHowever, according to Shari?ah, every adult (matured) male and female have an independent right to choose their marriage partners. If by ?arranged marriage? you mean that the parents have arranged the marriage of their son/daughter without their consent as is the custom in some places, then it is incorrect. If the child is not happy with the choice of their parents, they may decline and choose a partner of their choice. However, since marriage is a big step in one?s life, children should consult with their parents and consider their advises as their advises are generally motivated by their love for their child."
