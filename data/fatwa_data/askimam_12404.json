  "answer": "QUESTION\nI watch a TV programme daily on Q-TV (ARY Digital) of IRF (Islamic Research Foundation) in which Dr.Zakir Naik gives a lecture to Muslims and Non-Muslims. I have gained a sea of religious information about Islamic from it and it strengthens my faith and imaan. Is watching and listening to such lectures on TV prohibited or permissible?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWatching animate objects on television is not-permissible, regardless of whether the content of the program is Islamic or not. The benefit it holds doesn't legalize its use, even alcohol has benefits, yet remains Haraam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl.
