  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam Alaikum. I would like to know the tabeer of this dream. In my dream i saw myself writing a test in my class, the test was a long one. Anyways, after the test was over I walked out of the room, and saw a table with marked test papers sitting on them. As I flipped through them, I saw the test paper of one of my family friend, who is also the sister of a good friend of mine. I then saw the marks she obtained and it was 29. When I enquired from someone how much it was out of, i got a reply back saying it was out fo 29. Then I saw myself get back from school and to her house, I teased her a little about her grades, then showed her the test paper, and she was very pleased. What could this mean?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream is an indication of success in studies. True success in ones\nstudies and profession is to obey the laws of Allah within the profession\nand serve humanity for the pleasure of Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
