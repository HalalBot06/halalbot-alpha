Please let me know if it is an \"Authentic picture\". And if it is truely what it says it is. Thank you very much. I will send your information (if I get it) to many muslims. Salam Alaikum.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe have been informed by reliable authorities that this picture is not the\npicture of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)'s grave. The grave of Nabi\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is simple, covered with a green cloth similar\nto the pattern of the Kiswa. It is a simple stone without any turbans or\nsheets around it.\n\nThe picture is the tomb of Mawlana Jalaaluddin Rumi, Konya (Turkey).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
