  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum,\nPlease answer my question Mufti Saheb.\nI am the only muslim in my office and the rest are Christians. On the 25th December one of them decided to have a get together in the office and ordered pizza. I proposed to pay for my pizza as I knew that the get together was for christmas. But the host declined and I ate along with them. I want to ask whether I have comitted Kufr as this get together was for Christmas? And do I have to renew my Nikah?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccepting the invitation of your colleagues at work for a pizza on Christmas day, despite being unadvisable, does not constitute an act of kufr. Your intention was not one of honoring the Christian holiday and neither was it one of venerating Christianity as a religion. Thus, you did not commit an act of kufr and your Nikāh is still intact. However, it is not desirable to become too friendly and amicable with non-Muslims, especially whilst sharing in their religious activities. Furthermore, there is a good possibility that the food contained harām ingredients, which will cause a severe detriment to your spirituality.\n\n \n\nوَبِخُرُوجِهِ إلَى نَيْرُوزِ الْمَجُوسِ لِمُوَافَقَتِهِ مَعَهُمْ فِيمَا يَفْعَلُونَ في ذلك الْيَوْمِ وَبِشِرَائِهِ يوم النَّيْرُوزِ شيئا لم يَكُنْ يَشْتَرِيهِ قبل ذلك تَعْظِيمًا لِلنَّيْرُوزِ لَا لِلْأَكْلِ وَالشُّرْبِ وَبِإِهْدَائِهِ ذلك الْيَوْمِ لِلْمُشْرِكِينَ وَلَوْ بَيْضَةً تَعْظِيمًا لِذَلِكَ لَا بِإِجَابَةِ دَعْوَةِ مَجُوسِيٍّ (الفتاوى الهندية ج2 ص 277 , دار الفكر)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nMl.
