  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n    Ism-e-Azam are the great names of Allah, when recited invokes the mercy of Allah.\n\n    ‘Laa ilaaha illaa anta, subhaanaka inniy kuntu minaz-dhaalimeen.’\n\n    Hakim narrates in his Kitaab (pg.506) of the Hadith narrated by Sa’ad ibn Abi-Waqqas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ‘Yunus (Alayhis salaam) made this Du’aa at the time he was in whale’s stomach. A Muslim who makes Du’aa with this, Allah will answer such a Du’aa.\n\n    There are many views regarding Ism-e-Azam. This is just one of them, but the most preferred saying is, ‘O Allah, verily I am asking you, verily I witness that you are definitely Allah, no God besides you are Ahadus-Samad, the One Who is Independent, The One Who does not give birth nor was he given birth to and there is none equal to Him.’ (Tirmidhi)\n\n    and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n    Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
