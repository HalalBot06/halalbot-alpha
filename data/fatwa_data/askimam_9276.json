  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssal-o-alakum mufti sahab,I've asked this question before twice but u did'nt answer me.I want to ask that can a syed girl marry with a boy who is not a syed? Please give me any reference about ur answer.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA Sayed girl as well as a non-Sayed girl can only marry with the consent of their guardians respectively. However, if any lady gets married without the consent of her guardians, to such a person who is not her Kufwu (rank) the Nikah will not be enacted. By Kufwu we mean his%2Fher status in respect of religion, lineage, affluence, profession, etc. In your case you are from a noble lineage that is why it is highly recommended that you marry a Sayed boy.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe reason why Islam encourages one to marry within his%2Fher Kufwu is so that they may be compatible with each other and also be happy as they will know what is wanted from the other spouse. If the person is not of the same Kufwu there is a possibility that that person will feel inferior to the other and will not be comfortable to mix with the family. We should bear in mind that when a person marries someone, they will not be marrying that person alone but instead will be joining ties between two families. Therefore it will be better for a girl to obey her guardian?s wishes in order to keep everyone happy. Insha-Allah, Allah Ta?ala will bless such a marriage which was enacted with the guardian?s consent.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Ashraf%0D%0ADARUL IFTA ?
