  "question": "Is embryo-transfer can be permissible in Islam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs embryo-transfer can be permissible in Islam? This is not the only sperm or the egg donation. It is the freezed embryo itself, which by their own parents permission are given to some other infertile couple. These embryos are hatched to infertile woman?s uterus. So infertile women can have/adopt the baby from the very beginning. For the sake of Allah, please reply.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn reality, the embryo is the product of another man and woman. The lady in whom the embryo is implanted is the surrogate mother. Surrogacy would not be permissible as the source of the embryo is of another man who is not the husband of the surrogate mother. (Islamic principles on Family Planning pg.150)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
