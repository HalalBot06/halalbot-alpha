  "question": "Marriage - What are mine and his right according to hadiths and the quran?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have been nearly married for about 4 years, my husband still does not want a child, I have tried talking to him, but we always argue, and he just does not understand!\n\nHe says he is not ready and does not want a child yet...I'am nearly 30, I dont know what else to do, I'am fed up and I don't know what else to do, I just feel like walking away sometimes, it hurts so much and it upsets me a lot, but he just wont listen!\n\nWhat are mine and his right according to hadiths and the quran?\n\nIs there any dua or something I can do to?\n\nWe also havent been getting on, he has been very horrible to me, eg calls me names etc, is there any dua for this sort of treatment?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n-         “Not being ready” for a child is a lame excuse to practice birth control.\n\n-         It is your right that he ejaculates within you.\n\n-         It is only natural that you would get upset when your biological clock is ticking away without children. Exercise patience and tackle him when he is in a good mood. Explain to him the virtues of having children\n\n-         Perform Two rakaats of Salaatul-Hajaat and make duaa before Allah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
