  "question": "What effect does the numbering system have?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am confused about the numbering system. I had an incident when I got married when my wife got scared of something when she was alone at home at around Fajar time. Someone told us that there is a problem with the house spiritually so move to a diffferent house and try to get a house with a sum = odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).\n\nThe house we were staying in had an even number 614 (I think). After this we have moved a couple of times and lived in houses whose numbers calculate as odd and faced no problems. Now I want to move to a new house and want to clarify my concept. Is there anything wrong with houses with sum of even numbers or is it my superstition.\n\nAssalam o Alaikum\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu `alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nAs Muslims, we place our trust in Allah (Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala) in all our affairs. Whatever happens in this World occurs with the will (Taqdeer) of Allah (Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala).One should never become despondent nor give way to baseless suspicions.\n\nBelieving in the effectiveness of even numbers has no basis in Islam. Believing in the numbering system being the cause of harm is a baseless superstition. One should not pay any attention to such baseless superstitions.\n\nSuperstitions existed in the Pre- Islamic era of Jaahiliyyah (ignorance). Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) abolished all such superstitions as baseless and having no place in Islam.\n\nRead the Aayatul Kursi for protecting ones home against all type of calamities and difficulties.\n\nRasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said:\n\n \n\nاذا اويت الي فراشك فاقرا اية الكرسي فانك لن يزال عليك من الله حافظ\n\nTranslation: “When you recline to your resting place, read Aayatul Kursi for verily; Allah remains as a guardian over such a person” (Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 281/1, Darul Fikr)\n\nThe Aayatul Kursi is as follows:\n\nاللَّهُ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ مَنْ ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِنْدَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْعَظِيمُ\n\n  \n\nTranslation:  Allah is He besides Whom there is no god, the Everliving, the Self-subsisting by Whom all subsist; slumber does not overtake Him nor sleep; whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is His; who is he that can intercede with Him but by His permission? He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they cannot comprehend anything out of His knowledge except what He pleases, His knowledge (throne) extends over the heavens and the earth, and the preservation of them both tires Him not, and He is the Most High, the Great.\n\n(Surah Al – Baqarah, 2/255)\n\nAdopt all precautionary measures to safeguard ones interests and thereafter hand all ones affairs to Allah (Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala).\n\n\nAnd Allah knows best.\n\nIsmail Desai,\nDurban, South Africa\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\n\nChecked and Approved\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n(2012-01-13)"
