  "question": "Who should the recipients of my will be, and how much should they receive?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam Alaikum, I am a single, employed female with a pension and no children. My next of kin are my parents and I have 2 brothers. I wish to write a will and I need to know to whom I must bequeath my possessions/money. Furthermore, in what proportions is the money to be distributed to the benefactors as stipulated in the Qur'an? Can I set aside a certain amount (i.e the lump-sum payout of my pension) that I may choose who to allocate it to at my discretion (as the payout does not really constitute my 'earnings')?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. You should draw up your will to the effect that upon your death, after\npayment of debts, your estate be distributed according to Islamic law to the\nrightful heirs. You may also make a bequest not exceeding one third of your\nnett Estate and also the bequest cannot be in favour of your heirs.\nIf a woman dies leaving behind parents and 2 brothers, her mother inherits\none sixth of the estate whilst the father inherits the balance of the\nestate. The brothers in this case do not inherit anything. Therefore, you\nmay bequeath one third of your estate to the brothers provided you are not\npre-deceased by your father. In this case, another ruling applies.\n2. Your pension pay-out also makes up part of your estate. Hence, the same\nrules will apply.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
