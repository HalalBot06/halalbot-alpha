  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI refer to the long hadith below. Is it authentic and what is the source of the narration?\n\nJazakallah Khair\n\nThe Messenger of Allah SallAllahu alaihi wasallam said, “I was made to love three things from this world – perfume, women, and prayer.’\n\nThe companions were sitting with him and Abu Bakr RadhiAllahu anhu said, “You have spoken the truth, O Messenger of Allah! I was made to love three things from this world – looking at the face of the Messenger of Allah SallAllahu alaihi wasallam, spending my wealth for the the Messenger of Allah SallAllahu alaihi wasallam, and giving my daughter in marriage to the Messenger of Allah SallAllahu alaihi wasallam.\n\n‘Umar RadhiAllahu anhu said, “You have spoken truthfully, O Abu Bakr! I was made to love three things from this world – commanding good, forbidding evil, and worn garments.”\n\n‘Uthman said, “You have spoken truthfully, O ‘Umar! And I was made to love three things from this world – feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and reading the Qur’an.”\n\n‘Ali said, “You have spoken truthfully, O ‘Uthman! I was made to love three things from this world -serving the guest, fasting in summer, and fighting with the sword.”\n\nAs they were discoursing, Jibreel Alaihis Salam came and said, “Allah the Exalted sent me when He heard your discussion and has ordered you to ask me what I would have loved if I were to be from the people of this world. The Messenger of Allah SallAllahu alaihi wasallam asked, “If you were to be from the people of this world what would you have loved?”\n\nJibreel Alaihis Salam replied, “Guiding those led astray, keeping the company of contented strangers, and helping families afflicted with hardship.”\n\nHe continued, “The Lord of Honour loves three things from His servants – giving one’s utmost, crying when in regret, and being patient in times of poverty.”\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nThere are two parts to this Hādīth. The first part (I was made to love....) is authentic and found in the books of Hadīth with slight variations in there wordings.\n\n \n\nRefer to:\n\n1. Sunan Al- Nasāi (vol 2, pg 93, Qadīmi)\n\n2.  Sunan Al-Baihaqi al-Kubrā (vol 7, pg 78, Maktaba Dār Al-Bāz)\n\n3. Musnad Ahmad (vol 3, pg 128, Maktaba Qurtuba)  \n\n \n\nHereunder is the Arabic text of the Hadīth:\n\n \n\nعن أنس قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم حبب إلي من الدنيا النساء والطيب وجعل قرة عيني في الصلاة  \n\n \n\nWe were unable to locate the second part of the Hadīth (The companions were sitting with him and Abu Bakr.....) in the authentic books of Hadīth. However, we have located it in Al-Mawāhib al-Ladunniyya and Kashf Al-Khafā, but without a Sanad (chains of narrators). It is difficult to verify its authenticity without a Sanad. Imam Tabari has stated that Imam Janadi gathered this Hadīth and is responsible to produce its chain of narrators.\n\n \n\nHence, the first part of the Hadīth is authentic whilst the second part cannot be considered authentic or fabricated until its chain of narrators are found.\n\n \n\nوقال الطبري خرجه الجندي والعهدة عليه انتهى (كشف الخفاء ، المواهب)\n\n \n\n \n\nRefer to:\n\n1. Al-Mawāhib al-Ladunniyya (vol 2, pg 222, Maktaba Taufīqiyya)\n\n2. Kashf Al-Khafā (vol 1, pg 303, Ilmiyya)\n\n3. Sharh Allāma Zarqāni (vol 6, pg 375, Ilmiyya)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
