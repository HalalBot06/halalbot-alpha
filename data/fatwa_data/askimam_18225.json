  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question regards prayer. I reverted to islam in 2007! But with family pressures and health problems i stopped salat. Even though i was not praying i still identified with islam. Certain family members tried everything to get me to reconsider christianity i talkedto a preacher but i didn't agree with it anymore. Yet with everything going on i wasn't fulfilling certain requirements like salat and fasting. What should i do? Do i need to retake shahada? And how can i make up over a years worth of prayers? Anyhelp would be greatly appreciated.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is wonderful to hear that you have reverted to this beautiful Deen. May Almighty Allāh keep you steadfast on the guided path. Ameen.\n\nMany reverts experience domestic resistance; you are one of many such cases. This is somewhat normal and takes time, sometimes a very long time, for the family to except this change. Even after the pressure and being approached by a preacher you mentioned that you identified with Islām; this is laudable and who knows, it may be a means of guidance for your family.\n\nAs you may very well know, Salāh is an important pillar of Islām. Sharī’a has placed great emphasis on Salāh to such an extent that even at the time of severe and chronicle sickness, if one is not able to stand, then one should perform the Salāh sitting and if one is not able to sit, then one should perform it lying down.\n\nSimilarly, Fasting too is a pillar of Islām and should never be omitted unless there is a valid Sharī excuse. The health problems you mentioned may be a valid reason for not Fasting, but that is not clear and no ruling can be passed on that.\n\n Due to omitting Salāh and Fasting, Shahāda is not required; however you need to make sincere Taūbah and Istighfār (repentence) for all that has been missed and make a firm intention and resolution never to let any Salāh and Fast be missed in future. Even though one made Istighfār and Taūbah, Salāh is such an ‘Ibādah that has to be executed, if missed, Qadhā must be performed of that Salāh. In other words, you need to fulfil all the Salāh that has been missed. It is best that all Qadhā Salāh be performed as soon as possible.\n\nIt is also understandable that due to our profession or daily chores, it may not be possible to cover up a years’ Salāh in a couple of days, even in couple of months. Therefore, a table has been attached (hereunder) to make life easy in catching up on missed Salāh and Fasts.\n\n \n\n\t\n\nFajr\n\n\t\n\nThūr\n\n\t\n\nAsr\n\n\t\n\nMaghrib\n\n\t\n\nEshā\n\n\t\n\nWitr\n\n\t\n\nFast\n\n\n\n\nMonday\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTuesday\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWednesday\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThursday\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFriday\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSaturday\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSunday\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n \n\nThis table covers a week of Salāh and Fasting. Each time a Salāh is performed or Fast, just tick in the block. You could calculate the year in this manner (i.e. by weeks), or you could use this table to formulate a table of your own that is ideal for you.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
