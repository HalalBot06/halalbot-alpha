  "question": "If I go against istikhara namaaz, what is the result (I made intikhara namaaz to marry a girl but the answer was no)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIstikhaara literally means to seek good. When a person makes Istikhaara, he\nis asking Allah Ta'ala to guide him to the way that will benefit him the\nmost, not only in this world, but in the hereafter as well. Since everything\nis contained in Allah Ta'ala's infinite knowledge, that which is beneficial\nor harmful to us is best known to Him.\n\nYou have 'sought the good' from Allah and He, in His infinite mercy has\npointed out the way. Therefore, to go against this would be to your\nmisfortune. Were you to suffer any difficulty or harm later in life, having\ngone against the Istikhaara, then you would have none to blame but yourself.\nGoing against the Istikhaara does not portend at good. If, however, you go\nagainst it and marry the girl, then it is hope that you will not suffer any\nsin.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
