  "answer": "QUESTION\nPerson having MPD has more than one personality ruling him. He dosent remember the other personalities but they remember him and discuss him. Could it be the work of Jinns?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMaashaa Allah, your query indicates a yearning to try and follow Deen correctly. May Allah Ta?ala make the path to Allah Ta?ala easy and successful.\n\nYes, it is a sin to court / date before Nikah. This leads to adultery of the eyes, hands, heart and finally the actual act. The effect of the sin has also often been on the marriage ? that after a short term beautiful courtship ? the marriage is a rocky road with many upheavals.\n\nAn alternate suggestion which many youth are option for is a very simple Nikah ? courting thereafter which is permissible and finally ?Rookhsati? when the girl goes away from her family to her marital home. Instead of having a big function at Nikah, you would rather a nice Walima.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nSister Amatullah\nSOCIAL DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
