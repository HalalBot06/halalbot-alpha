  "question": "If she changes herself completely, how can i findout if she has done is for Allah (SWT) or just to show me that she is now pious (as I told her that I want to marry a pious girl)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was not properly practising Islam. I had a girl in my home town we were quite interesed in getting married, but she was very liberal. she had other male friends as well so I dropped the idea (she use to offer 5 times prayers & etc.), but her only problem was she had male friends. In USA i met a nice person & now I am associated with work of Da'wa. I am trying my best to become a proper muslim. now after a year, I talked to that girl on internet, she was almost the same liberal person, so I didn't proceed further. I prayed alot in my prayers to Allah to give her Hadaya, one day she talked to me I donno why & how it came in my mind to talk to her about greatness of Allah (SWT) when I did that she listened to it & after that she took it very seriously & is trying to change her way of life in accordance with islam. Mufti sahab, I am interested in marrying a pious girl so that she can strengthen my Iman. I have following question. 1. If she really changes herself by heart & follow commandments of Allah (SWT), then will It be cruel on my part if I tell her that I can not marry her because I know about her past. Will I be held responsible for anything or do I have a right to refuse someone on above mentioned reason? (in reference to Islam) 2. If she changes herself completely, how can i findout if she has done is for Allah (SWT) or just to show me that she is now pious (as I told her that I want to marry a pious girl) Jazak-allah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. You have the right to refuse marriage with her based on her past. It will\nnot be cruel either. It is better to refuse now than marrying her and\nregretting later on.\n2. If she has changed and you are at ease and you feel that she has\nsincerely changed, accept her. Employ your own discretion and judgment.\nHowever, we suggest that you do not doubt her intentions. Accept everything\nshe claims and if you wish to marry her after this, go ahead.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
