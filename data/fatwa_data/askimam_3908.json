  "question": "Salam I am wondering what is the reward of giving money to build a mosque? Does giving money to the mosque fall in the same category as giving Zakat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf it doesn't fall under giving Zakat, what does it fall under? And does giving money to build a mosque erase your sins?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Whosoever builds a Musjid,\nAllah will build a house (palace) for him in Jannah.'\n\nThe above Hadith has three glad tidings: a) Entrance into Jannah, b) Having\na special place in Jannah, c) Forgiveness of sins as one will enter Jannah\nfree from sins.\n\nOne may contribute only Lillah money in the building of the Musjid. Zakaat\nmoney cannot be used for that purpose as Zakaat may be given only to the\npoor and needy.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
