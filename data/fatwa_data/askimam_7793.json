  "question": "What is the rule for a lady having her body waxed by another lady, including above her thighs etc?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is the rule on a lady wanting to have her body waxed by another lady thereby removing her hair, including her legs above her thighs and other parts of her satr? Similarly, what is the ruling for a woman who wishes to remove acne from her body through laser treatment, administered by a lady, also including parts of her satr such as her thighs, buttocks etc? Is the ruling different if other treatments to remove acne have failed that were administered by herself only? What if the husband finds the acne unslightly and to please him there is no other alternative but to expose herself before other ladies in order for the treatment to be administered? Does this all fall under cosmetic changes and therefore there is no rukhsa? Also, please give some advice on approaching wives that pressurise their husbands to do all these cosmetic changes even though the husbands are happy with them as they are. Please try and answer in detail and may Allah reward you well.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Another lady is allowed to remove unwanted hair from those parts of the body that fall out of the Satar area ? like arms, calves, face, etc. However, the thighs, bikini area, etc. fall with the Satr, hence, another woman may not remove the hair. She should do it herself. In the case where another woman is permitted to remove the hair, this would only be permitted if it is carried out within the confines of the home and not in a salon, beauty clonic, etc.\n\n2. If other treatments of acne have failed, she may go for laser treatment even if the treatment is to be administered within the Satr area. The treatment of acne does not fall under cosmetic treatment but rather under treatment of a ?skin disorder?.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
