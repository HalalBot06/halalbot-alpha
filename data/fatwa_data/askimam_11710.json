  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a software engineer. I need to know whether 1. Working as a consultant in a software department of a mutual-fund organization through a software permissible or not? 2. Working as a consultant in a software department of a health-insurance organization is permissible or not? 3. Working as a consultant in a software department of a life-insurance organization is permissible or not?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWorking for any of these companies, even though it may be in the software department would not be permissible for the following reasons:\n\n1. The salary would be from Haraam wealth.\n2. You would be aiding them in Haraam\n3. You would be involved in interest, either in recording it or witnessing its transactions or consuming it. (Aap ke masaail vol.6 pg.243-255)\n\nWe would thus advise you to seek employment in a company involved in Halaal activities. If you are already working for this company, don't leave your job immediately but start looking for alternate employment.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
