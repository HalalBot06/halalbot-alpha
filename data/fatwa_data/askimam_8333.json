  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. My mother is always getting the blame for something she did not do (in the family) she is trying to make everything better for her children and the family but it is as though everyone thinks that she is planning something against them, also some of my family backbite about her. Why is this, she reads namaz five times a day and is a very good mother but we still have a lot of family problems? Is this just a way Allah could be testing us to see if we can handle it and go through it? What duas can I read for my family and could you please make dua for my family and all the Muslims who are having a lot more troubled times. 2. What do the Barelwis believe and what is wrong with their belief, are they part of Ahlus Sunnat Wal Jamaat? Jazaakallah Khair for taking the time to read and answer the question.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou write that there are lots of problems in your family and that \"everyone\" is ganging up against your mother.\n\nWhat sort of problems is she being blamed for and why is she the only one being blamed \"all the time?\" Is your father not present in the household (so that he can intervene in sorting out the conflicts which are occurring?) Seeing that you are so concerned about your mother, what have you tried to explain to the family about your mum's situation to them. How have you dealt with the harassment and how have you tried to stop them from backbiting?\n\nPlease elaborate further. I shall be awaiting your reply.\n\nMay Allah guide you and your family and strengthen kinship ties in your family and all Muslim families, ameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nSister Fadila\nSOCIAL DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
