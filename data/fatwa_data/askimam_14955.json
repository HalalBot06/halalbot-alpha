  "question": "If women are a treasure for men, isn't there anything for a woman to treasure?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf there's no difference between the relationship between Allah swt and men and His relationship to women, why is the woman's role completely to be subservient to her husband? I can understand if that were her test in this life, but even if she can possibly get to Jannah, her husband will still be chasing other women? If women are a treasure for men, isn't there anything for a woman to treasure?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe answer is simple: it is an issue of Jannah. The principle there is your wish will be fulfilled. If a woman wants something to treasure, her wish will be fulfilled as is the case with men.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
