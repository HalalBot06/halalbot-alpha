  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n\nMufti Sahab, i am in a slight dilemma. I went to Pakistan in 2006 and bought a book on Syedna Imam Ali (KW), by a Sunni author, professor Masud-ul-Hassan. I now feel that so far I have been exposed to a side which disregards Muhammad SAW’s family which after reading a commentary by Abdullah Yusuf Ali, Allah thoroughly purified extensively ayah 33:33. I have always attended a deobandi mosque, deobandi conferences such as Khatme Nubuwat and Azmate Sahabaa. I now sometimes sit and think why did and why don’t deobandi scholars ever mention the virtues of the Ahlul-Bayt (RA)? I have even been to conferences where the virtues of Muaawiya are blasted out the speaker phones when clearly it is in Muslim history books that he caused a lot of rift between the Ummah of Rasoolullah SAW. I can’t express enough the despair I’m in. I’m only 22 years old and to the deobandi mosques that I have been to, none have ever talked or had a speech about Imam Ali or the Ahlul Bayt. Quite the contrary Hazrat Abu Bakr, Umar and Utman (RA) are always talked about and their virtues which the maulvis are always deriving examples from. Another concept which I find difficult is this veneration of Imam Abu Hanifa. These maulvis talk about his status to such an extent that it feels that he is somewhat better, what about the Imamate of Ali, Hassan and Hussein RA etc. Can you please give me some guidance? I am a Sunni Muslim and it’s the time of my life where I want to better myself as a Muslim, I always try to pray five times a day, come from a religious family. I look forward to your reply.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\n \n\nDeobandi’s honour and revere all Sahaba. This includes Ahlul Bayt, Sayyiduna Ali, Hassan and Hussain (Radiyallāhu anhum). We have no disregard for any Sahaba.\n\n \n\nShias consider Sayyiduna Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthmān and all Sahaba besides Ali (Radiyallāhu anhum) as Kāfirs. Khatme Nubuwwat and Azmate Sahaba in Pakistān host conferences defending the integrity of these Sahaba. Therefore, this is the reason Deobandi’s speak particularly on the life and virtues of these Sahaba.\n\n \n\nBooks of history incorrectly portray the personality of Sayyiduna Mu’āwiyah (Radiyallāhu anhu). Many accusations were attributed to him. Therefore, conferences on his virtues are hosted to clear these accusations. Mu’āwiyah (Radiyallāhu anhu) did differ with Ali (Radiyallāhu anhu) on issues. However, these were issues based on Ijtihād and in no way was he responsible for creating rift in the Ummah. No one has the right to speak negative concerning Mu’āwiyyah (Radiyallāhu anhu). He was a Sahabi and Allāh Ta’āla has expressed his pleasure with all Sahaba (Radiyallāhu anhum) in the Qurān. Whoever dares to do so should heed to the following narrations:\n\n \n\nعن ابن عمر قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم إذا رأيتم الذين يسبون أصحابي فقولوا لعنة الله على شركم\n\n“When you see the people speaking evil of my companions, then say: May the curse of Allāh be on your evil” (Sunan Al-Tirmidhi, 2/225, Sa’eed)\n\n \n\nعن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم أنه قال لمعاوية اللهم اجعله هاديا مهديا واهد به\n\n“Rasulullāh (Sallallāhu alayhi wa sallam) said to Mu’āwiyah: Oh Allāh, make Mu’āwiyah a guide, keep him guided and guide people through him” (Sunan Al-Tirmidhi, 2/224, Sa’eed)\n\n \n\nلم ينقل عن السلف المجتهدين والعلماء الصالحين جواز اللعن علي معاوية\n\n“None of the pious Ulāmā of the past have permitted cursing Mu’āwiyah” (Sharh Al-‘Aqāid, pg 116)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
