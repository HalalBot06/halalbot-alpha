  "answer": "QUESTION\nThis Question was posted on one of the very popular websites ,after reading this I was very confused about the answer can you please comment about Fatwaa from Shaykh Mansoor Al-Bahooti which is written in bold.\n---------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion :\n\n    I am a young man, twenty-nine years old. I woke up yesterday and I had just had an erotic dream, but no fluid was emitted, and I went back to sleep. But when I woke up again, I found that I had a severe pain in my testicles. I know that there is some fluid that is retained in me, because this has happened to me before and I treated it by sitting in warm water and getting rid of this retained fluid. In fact I decided to use the same treatment as before, but the warm water did not do anything and I suffered intense pain, and the shaytaan whispered to me to get rid of this fluid by means of the secret habit, so I did that. I swear that I had given up this habit a long time ago, but I was under pressure because of this pain.\n\n\nAnswer :\n\n    Praise be to Allaah.\n\n    The secret habit is haraam. This has been explained in the answer to question no. 329.\n\n    The scholars have stated that it is permissible to resort to the secret habit if that is in order to relieve desire that may lead one to fall into the sins of zina or homosexuality. Similarly it is permissible for the purpose of medical tests if he is single and needs such tests. And it is permissible to resort to it if there is the fear of physical harm due to retention of semen. Perhaps this is what is referred to in the question. In any case, it is not permissible to go beyond the bounds of necessity, and it is not permissible to repeat it, and necessity should be measured without exaggerating.\n\n    Shaykh Mansoor al-Bahooti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\n\n    Whoever masturbates by hand for fear of falling into zina or for fear of physical harm, there is no sin on him if he is not able to get married, not even to a slave woman, and he cannot afford a slave woman, otherwise it is haraam and he should be punished by ta’zeer. End quote.\n\n    Al-Iqnaa’, 4/268.\n\n    In Sharh Muntaha al-Iraadaat (3/364) it says:\n\n    Whoever masturbates, man or woman, when there is no need, it is haraam to do that and he (or she) should be punished for it by ta’zeer, because it is a sin. If he does it for fear of zina or homosexuality, there is no sin on him, and the same applies, even more so, if he does it for fear of physical harm. End quote.\n\n    We applaud you for giving up this bad habit and urge you to remain steadfast in that, and if what you did was only because of the pain, then there is no sin on you in sha Allaah.\n\n    And Allaah knows best.\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlso Another question I have to ask is about my marriage.I have to get married and I am residing in west and the girl is in India.By the time I take off from my schedule it will be may be one more year or little bit more than that  for me to go to india.What do you suggest for me ,I mean what are the sharaiee possibilities to make it happen as soon as possible,may be nikah on fone or some thing like that...\n\n\nJazakallah for your response.\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are some Fatwas that are issued according to the circumstances and the specific needs of some individuals. Such Fatwas should not be for public view or else that may lead to abuse. This is one of such Fatwas.\n\nThere should be one addition to this Fatwa. The person should also repent and make Istighfaar.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
