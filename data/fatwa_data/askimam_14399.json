  "question": "is Egyaarwi Shareef permissible.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. i recently attended an EGYAARWI SHAREEF - this was the first time i have attended it, and found that people were reading the quraan, and thereafter making Zikr - but in their Zikr they read YA SHAIKH ABDUL QADER JILAANI SHAI NILLAH - I'm not sure what this meant, and they also mentioned that the Auliyallah visit these gatherings.\n\ni have three questions:\n\na. is Egyaarwi Shareef permissible.\n\nb. the zikr of ya shaikh - is that permissible\n\nc. the belief of the auliya allah been presen at these gatherings - is this correct\n\n2. Daily after Fajr, i read my hizbul azam and make quraan tilaawat, thereafter i send salaat and salaam to Rasoolullah sallallahu alayhi wasallam, using the words As Salaatu was Salaamy alayka Ya Rasoolulah, Ya Habiballah , Ya Khaira Khalqillah, and thereafter make this dua - Ya Rasoolullah, Inni as alooka- shafa-ata wa atawassaloo beka illahi fe he an ummata muslima ala millateka wa sunnatik. When i send this salaat and salaam, i sit in the Tashahud position, and I DO NOT have the belief that Rasoolullah is present - I believe the angels take the salaat and salaam to him. Pls advise if my actions are correct.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. in order for us to comment regarding Egaayrwi function, it is important that you explain exactly what the programme entails and the contents of them.\n\n2. It is not permissible to make Zikr of anyone besides Allah. If Zikr is made with the belief that the sheikh or anyone besides Allah will fulfill their needs, the Imaan of such has to be renewed as this is tantamount to ascribing partners with Allah.\n\n3. Allah Alone is that Being who is All Present and All Seeing. Whoever believes that anyone else besides Allah posses these attributes have come out of the fold of Islam.\n\n4. It is permissible to recite this Durood, if you recite it with the belief that you have mentioned.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
