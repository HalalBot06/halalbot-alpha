  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have been in USA one month, I am from Libya, and as you know as I as Mouslim I can not eat any kind of meat, ecept Halal meat, as you know too the grosaries here don't  sell Halal meat, so some one said that to me you can eat UN-Halal meat just you have to mention the name of ALLAH, my question\n\n is : Is that true or not ????? please respond to me as soos as possible.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\n \n\nIt is not permissible to eat the meat of animals slaughtered by non-muslims, for the simple reason that they do not take the name of Allah at the time of slaughter. Allah Ta’ala says:\n\nولا تأكلوا مما لم يذكر اسم الله عليه وانه لفسق\n\nAnd do not eat from that (meat) which the name of Allah was not recited upon and undoubtedly, it (to eat this meat) is a sin.\n\n(Surah.6 verse.121)\n\nIt is not correct to simply recite the name of Allah on anything Haraam and consume it.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa\n\nImportant Posts and Links\n\n \n\nShar'ii stance on Shares and Stocks|Have you prepared your WILL??|Moonsighting - Its that time to sight the moon"
