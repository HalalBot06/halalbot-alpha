The object and purpose of the sun is to give light and warmth. The purpose for a motor vehicle is transport. Similarly, Allah has created human beings to fulfill a certain role in society. The male is tasked to fulfill the object of taking care of his dependants. If each creation fulfills the responsibility it has been tasked with, the world will function in a peaceful and harmonious atmosphere. When any creation abandons its task, the world will become a place of havoc and mishaps. Take for example, the sun assuming the responsibility of rain. We would then find ourselves in rain and floods almost everyday. It would become difficult to live a normal life thereafter.\n\nThe home is the fort of a woman. If she remains within the confines of her home striving to take care of her husband and children, she will be protected from many harms and difficulties. A woman assuming the position of employment will result in her neglecting the very purpose of her creation. Allah has placed the responsibility of her sustenance upon the shoulders of the husband if she is married. There is no need for her to sustain herself.  \n\nYou state that you are currently studying for your medical examination. Surely, this is time consuming and will result in you neglecting your motherly responsibilities to your children. Your children require you personal and undivided attention. That appetite has to be fulfilled. If there is any shortcoming in that, it will be expressed in some way or the other in the child’s life. There is no price to pay to overcome such shortcomings. Why should you compromise in the proper and healthy upbringing of your children in the pursuit of your degree and materialistic gain?\n\nFurthermore, your commitment to serving your husband will definitely be minimized. This will create instability and frustration in you and your family. You should rather abandon your enthusiasm for pursuing your career in medical science and channel your energies and capabilities in serving your husband and children. This will give you more peace of mind and true satisfaction. Allah is Razzaaq – The Provider. He will provide for you just as He provides for the millions of creatures in the heavens, earth and oceans.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
