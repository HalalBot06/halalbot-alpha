  "question": "What is the definition of poorness (Faqr, Muflisi or Ghurbati) in Islam.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Please specify who comes under poorness (FAqr, Ghurbat or Muflisi) category in Islamic Shariah or what is the definition of poorness (Muflisi or Ghurbati) in Islam for which a lot of Ahadeeth has been quoted. In one Hadith Nabi Muhammad(S) stated that mostly poor people will enter into Jannah and in another Hadith Nabi Muhammad(S) pointed out that in my Ummah a lot of people will become MURTAD because of poorness (Faqr,Muflisi). 2. How we measure the poorness in the society especially cities verses villages?. 3. Which way (poorness or wealth) we have to choose for better survival in this Dunia and Hereafter. Jaza Kumullah Khair,\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFuqaraa are those people who are poor and who possess more than their basic needs but do not possess wealth equal to Nisaab.%0D%0A%0D%0AMasaakeen are those people who are destitute and extremely needy to the extent that they are forced to beg.%0D%0A%0D%0AMuflis: Prophet asked his Companions:Who is a Muflis (pauper)? The Noble companions replied: A pauper is one who has no money. He salallahu alaihe wasallam said: He is not a real pauper. A real pauper is one who leaves this world with a large collection of good deeds including prayers, fasts, Allah's rememberance, etc. When on the Day of Judgment he shall stand before Allah, he shall find a large crowd of men demanding compensation from him for their rights which this man had usurped. As is well-known, there will be no currency note in the Hereafter to pay off debts. The currency of the Hereafter is the good deeds of a man. Allah shall command that the good deeds of the man may be passed on to the claimants. As a result of this command, one man will take away his prayers, another one his fasts, someone will take away his remembrance and rehearsals, etc! ., and all his good deeds will become exhausted, yet their claims against this man will still remain unpaid. In such a situation, Allah will command that the claims of the creditors may be paid off by adding to his account the sins of the claimants. When he appeared on the scene his Record of deeds was full of good deeds, but at the time of leaving the place not only is the bag of his good deeds empty, but he is taking with him the burden of sins committed by others. Therefore, this man is a real pauper. (Tirmizi hadith #2533%0D%0A%0D%0AAbu Saeed Khudri (ra) said love the Maskeens for I have heard Rasoolullah salallahu alaihe wasallam say in his dua \"Make me from amongst the miskeens and give me death in this state and raise me in the group of the masakeens. (Ibn Maja)%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen Rasoolullah salallahu alaihe wasallam said make me from amongst the maskeen, it means give me the humbleness that the maskeen have. Do not give the pride of the arrogant, but give me humbleness. It doesn't mean that take away my provisions etc.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe should always thank Allah for whatever wealth and provisions He has given us. If someone is unthankful, then Allah will take that blessing away. Also whatever wealth Allah has bestowed to us we should make sure we do not exceed limits. We should be careful and not spend for unnecessary items. %0D%0A%0D%0AWe should not wish for poverty and poorness in wealth. If we look today poverty does lead people to kufr. Today the disbelievers give money to the muslims by putting the condition of turning away from religion. Thus they do this and many muslims become murtads. Therefore we should seek Allah's protection from faqr. However we should ask for humbleness and humility. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
