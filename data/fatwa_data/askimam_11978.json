  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe form and shape of a woman?s entire body is awrah. It is not permissible for a woman to wear a shirt that does not cover her bottom.\n\nA woman should wear such a garment in public that the form and shape of her entire body is concealed, for example, a loose cloak. A male should also dress up with modesty.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
