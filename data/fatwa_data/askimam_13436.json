However, you should be cautious that the impurities from the toilet do not splash on to your body and clothes.\n\nWith regards to cleaning yourself, you may take water with a bottle, etc. into the toilet to wash yourself. However, if this is difficult you may damp the tissue paper with water and use it to clean yourself.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
