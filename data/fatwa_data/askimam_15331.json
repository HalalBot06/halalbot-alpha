  "question": "Is propylene glycol and sucrose of fatty acids (E473) Halaal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan you please tell me whether propylene glycol and sucrose of fatty acids (E473) is halal? Its the ingrediants in \"Lotte  Spout\" its a gum made from a Korea Company, but I got it from Pakistan.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nJazak Allah for asking us this query. We understand the dilemma of purchasing a product that is suspicious in its permissibility from an Islamic country. Unfortunately, does not have a systemic filtering of imports for halal products.\n\nPropylene glycol is a colourless odorless organic compound which is sometime used as a solvent in food colours and flavours. Commercially, it is either derived from propylene oxide, or from glycerol. If it is derived from propylene oxide then it would be permissible. However if it is derived from glycerol then it is possible that glycerol was obtained from hydrolyzing process for animal fats and oils. If this ingredient is from animal slaughtered in halal way, then it will be halal for consumption, otherwise it will not be halal.\n\nAs for sucrose of fatty acids (E473), it is a commonly used as an emulsifier in food additives. It also can be derived from animals as well as through other origins. If this ingredient is from animal slaughtered in halal way, then it will be halal for consumption, otherwise it will not be halal.\n\nSince many of the products originating from eastern countries like do not mention such information, it is best to avoid these products. There are numerous bubble gums which are halal for consumption.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
