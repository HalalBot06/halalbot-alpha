  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIS YOUR GHUSL CORRECT?%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECK THESE FACTS:%0D%0AALL YOUR PRAYERS ARE INVALID IF YOUR GHUSL IS NOT CORRECT.%0D%0ACLEANLINESS IS HALF OF FAITH.%0D%0A%0D%0AHERE IS THE METHOD OF GHUSL ACCORDING TO SUNNAH.%0D%0ABefore making Ghusl one should make Niyyah (intention) thus: - \"I am%0D%0Aperforming Ghusl so as to become Paak.\" Without Niyyah, there is no Thawaab%0D%0A(reward) although Ghusl will be valid. Ghusl should be made in a place of%0D%0Atotal privacy and one should not face towards the Kiblah while making Ghusl.%0D%0AGhusl may be performed standing or seated, preferably seated. Use sufficient%0D%0Awater, don't skimp nor be wasteful. One should abstain from speaking while%0D%0Aperforming Ghusl. It is better not to read any Kalimah or Aayah while%0D%0Abathing. Be aware of these rules whilst making Ghusl.%0D%0A%0D%0APROCEDURE FOR PERFORMING GHUSL:%0D%0A* Wash both hands up to and including wrists.%0D%0A* Wash the private parts. The hands and private parts should be washed even%0D%0Aif one is not in the state of Janaabat or Najaasat.%0D%0A* If there is Najaasat elsewhere on the body, it should now be washed off.%0D%0A* Perform Wudhu (Read separate pamphlet for Wudhu according to Sunnah). If%0D%0Amaking Ghusl on a stool or platform where water will rapidly flow away, and%0D%0Athen perform the complete Wudhu. If there is fear of the feet being immersed%0D%0Ain wastewater during the Ghusl then postpone the washing of the feet to the%0D%0Aend of the Ghusl. Ensure that the mouth and nostrils are thoroughly rinsed%0D%0Athrice.%0D%0A* After performing Wudhu, pour water over the head thrice, then pour thrice%0D%0Aover right shoulder and thrice again over left shoulder. Now pour water over%0D%0Aentire body and rub. If the hair of the head is not plaited, it is%0D%0Acompulsory to wet all the hair up to the very base. If a single hair is left%0D%0Adry, Ghusl will not be valid. If the hair of a woman is plaited, she is%0D%0Aexcused from loosening her plaited hair, but it is compulsory for her to wet%0D%0Athe base of each and every hair. If one fails to do this then the Ghusl will%0D%0Anot be valid. As for men who grow long hair and plait them, they are NOT%0D%0Aexcused from leaving their hair dry. If a woman experiences difficulty or is%0D%0Aunable to wet the very bottom of her plaited hair, then it is necessary for%0D%0Aher to unplaite her hair and wash her entire head. It is Mustahab%0D%0A(preferable) to clean the body by rubbing it. All parts of the body should%0D%0Abe rubbed with the hand so as to ensure that water has reached all parts of%0D%0Athe body, and that no portion is left dry. Rings and earrings, etc. should%0D%0Abe moved so as to ensure that no portion covered by them is left dry. Ensure%0D%0Athat the navel and the ears are all wetted. If they are not wet Ghusl will%0D%0Abe incomplete.%0D%0A* On completion one should confine oneself to a clean place. If, while%0D%0Aperforming Wudhu, the feet had been washed, it is not necessary to wash them%0D%0Aagain. Dry the body with a clean towel, and dress as hastily as possible.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf, after Ghusl, one recalls that a certain portion of the body is left dry,%0D%0Ait is not necessary to repeat the Ghusl, but merely wash the dry portion. It%0D%0Ais not sufficient to pass a wet hand over the dry place. If one has%0D%0Aforgotten to rinse the mouth or the nostrils, these too could be rinsed when%0D%0Arecalled after Ghusl has been performed.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe three Faraa'ids (compulsory acts) of Ghusl are: -%0D%0A* To rinse the mouth in such a manner that water reaches the entire mouth.%0D%0A* To rinse the nostrils up to the ending of the fleshy part.%0D%0A* To completely wet the whole body. When one performs these Faraa'id%0D%0Aintentionally or unintentionally Ghusl will be valid.%0D%0A%0D%0APrepared by: Waterval Islamic Institute%0D%0A"
