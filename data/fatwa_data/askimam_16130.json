  "question": "Can i give her Talaaq while she is on her periods?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni m Married for last 3 years, I Heard If ur Wife is in Period It Is Not Allowed to Give Talaaq As She is Naa Pak. What About If a Woman is in Period Is it Possible to do Nikah in that Case or it is Prohibited.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is true that one should not issue his wife talaq during menses. However, if one did issue his wife talaq during menses, the talaq will be valid. (Bukhari, Chapter of Talaq)\n\nIf a woman experiences menses, it is permissible to marry her in that state. There is no prohibition to marry a woman in the state of menses. However, it is prohibited to consummate the marriage during menses.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
