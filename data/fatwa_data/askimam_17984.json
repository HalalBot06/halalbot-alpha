However, Islam being a complete religion acknowledges that sometimes a marriage cannot continue and it is in the better interests of both parties that the marriage comes to an end. It is as a final resolution that Islam permits divorce.\n\n \n\nOne should not be hasty in making a decision. Consider the pros and cons. Consult with the Ulama of your community or the seniors and elders of your family. Ask them to discuss with your wife and her family. Keep in mind your child when making a decision. Maybe you could leave things for awhile and let things cool down and make a decision later on. It could take a while before your wife would realize the repercussions of separation.\n\n \n\nAllah Ta’ala is the controller of hearts and conditions. Turn to Him and He will show you the way. Allah Ta’ala will put in their hearts to withdraw all files against you. Continuously beg and implore Allah Ta’ala to guide you and make things easy. Recite as much as Durud on Nabi صلى الله عليه وسلمas possible. Also stay away from all sins. If per chance you slip up immediately turn to Allah Ta’ala in repentance. Salah is also of paramount important. Make it a point to perform all your salah with jama’ah in the masjid. Also perform as much as nafl salah as possible.\n\n \n\nWe cannot advise you to whether you should continue or not as we are not fully aware of your situation. Our advice is that you get your elders involved. Ask their opinion. Take your time and do not be hasty in deciding.\n\n \n\nIf nothing works out or your elders advise that it is better to end your marriage, then you could end the marriage and continue on in life.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
