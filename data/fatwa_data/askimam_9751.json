  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have heard a hadith in which a sahaba once approached our prophet(pbuh) and said that the jews dont dye their hair. To that our prophet(pbuh) replied then you should dye your hair. 1.Is this hadith authentic? 2.If yes can we dye our hair using the dyes available in market. 3.Can we dye our hair to any colour? 4.My relative told me that our prophet liked people with white hair. Is this true?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. This Hadith is Sahih (authentic) and is recorded by Imaams Bukhari and Muslim in their respective collections. The exact wording of their narrations is as follows: Sayyiduna Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Verily the Jews and Christians do not dye (their hair), so you should dye (your hair).' (Sahih Bukhari Hadith3462, 5899; Sahih Muslim Hadith5477) According to the narration recorded by Imaam Timidhi in his sunan, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Change the white hairs and do not emulate the Jews.' (Sunan al-Tirmidhi Hadith1752)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. One may use the dyes that are available in the market as long as they do not contain any impure %2F Haraam substances. %0D%0A%0D%0A3. As for the colours, it is permissible for men to dye the hair any other colour besides black. (Shaami vol.6 pg.422; Sahih Muslim Hadith5476)%0D%0A%0D%0A4. We haven't come across any explicit Hadith with that meaning. However, there are Ahaadith wherein Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) praised white hair. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, 'Do not pluck white hair, for verily each one will be a means of noor (light) on the day of judgement.' According to some narrations, one will be rewarded for each strand. (Targheeb vol.3 pg.118)%0D%0A%0D%0ANote: This Hadith prevents plucking and not dying. Ebraahim (alayhis salaam) is also reported to have made Du'aa to Allah Ta'ala to increase his white hair. (Muwatta Imaam Maalik)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMl.
