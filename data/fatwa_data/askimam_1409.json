  "question": "What is the nature of Gog and Magog?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have one more question regarding the end days. I feel that all has not been told about the nature of Gog and Magog although there are countless hadith and some Quranic references about this race of people who are hidden from us. After being released will they wipe out mankind ? and how will they defeat such superpowers as USA,Russia and Western Powers? What nature of technology will they be using that the earth will succumb to them? It is said it will take the Muslims seven years to dispose of their weapons?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYajuj and Majuj are restricted behind a wall built by Zul Qarnain (see Surah\nKahf). They will emerge just befor Qiyamat and will wipe out all of mankind\nand drink all the waters of the oceans. Allah Ta'ala will order Eesa\n(Alayhis salaam) and his followers to hide by the mountains and they will\nexperience poverty and hunger. Yajuj and Majuj will be distroyed by a\nsickness afflicted to them and the entire earth will be filled with their\ndead bodies. Allah will appoint birds to dispose of their bodies and\nthereafter a\nheavy rain will come and cleanse the earth of the stench of their rotting\nbodies.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti E Desai\nFatwa Dept.\n____________"
