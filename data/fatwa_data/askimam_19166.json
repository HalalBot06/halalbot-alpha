  "question": "Can a woman operate a business from home and is it permissible to sell cell phones with video capabilities?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have read Fatwa # 11944 and learned many things regarding a wife's earnings. \n\n1.) If my husband's earnings are low and we are \"unable\" to give Zakāt or pay rent regularly or give Sadaqah wholeheartedly, can I operate a business from home and say to him that the earnings will be for you and me to share. Is this right?\n\n2.) Is it halāl to market cell phones? The customers can do harām things like watch videos or listen to music on the cell phones. So will the seller be held accountable for such actions on the Day of Qiyāmah?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\n1.) Yes, you may operate a business from your home. If you own the business (i.e. invest in it and run it yourself) then you have a right to all the profits. If you choose to share the profits with your husband to supplement his earnings you may do so as well.\n\n\n2.) Yes, it will be permissible for you to sell these cell phones. You will not be held accountable as they are primarily purchased for communications purposes.  This inquiry has also been answered previously on the site at the following link: http://www.askimam.org/fatwa/fatwa.php?askid=fa9d7c265a015758a451d55f1e4cce57\n\n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMl.
