  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs Euro Currency is cheap in Dubai and a little expensive in Frankfort or Amsterdam, I buy 5 cents cheaper in Dubai and sale it 5 cents more in Amsterdam.

I hide the 100000 Euro in my shoes. At Dubai airport they see my currency and ask for the original recite, Which I show them and they have no problem.
