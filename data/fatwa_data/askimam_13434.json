  "question": "Are Qadianis considered Muslims?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI always understood Qadiyanis to be like non-Muslims and therefore I would treat them just as the kuffar including my views that doing business with them and talking with them is permissable. However, I was recently told that it is not permissable to talk to Qadiyanis. I took this to be just another misconception but in order to clear my understanding can you please tell me whether it is true, that we are or aren't allowed to talk to Qadiyanis? Jazakumullaah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThose belonging to the Qadiani sect are out of the fold of Islaam. If they are found in a certain locality, then one is permitted to trade and speak with them only out of necessity. However, it will not be correct to maintain a close relationship with them. Trading with them brings monetary benefits to them. It is for this reason that some Ulama hold the opinion that it is impermissible to trade with them, since they may acquire power and plot against the Muslims. If one has already traded with them, then his transaction will not be considered Haraam.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf"
