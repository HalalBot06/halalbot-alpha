Saadu-deen Taftazani has explained the aspect of 'Where is Allah' in the following words, 'And he is not at any place'. (Sharh Aqaaid) %0D%0A%0D%0AImaam Maalik was asked about the Aayat in Surah Taaha, 'Allah is above His %C1rsh', he answered 'Being above (Istawaa) is known but the reality is unknown and - questioning that - is innovation.' Jaaluddin Suyyuti also comments on the Aayat saying, 'Istawaa (being above) according to whatever is appropriate for Allah. (Jalaalayn vol. 2 p. 260). %0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, the verse does not speak about the Zaat of Allah Ta%E3la being on the %C1rsh but it is to indicate the establishment and control of the Kingdom of Allah by Himself.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Salaat is Fardh. To miss out Salaat is a major sin for which one must make up for the missed Salaat and also make Istighfaar (seek forgiveness). In general, the rule of committing sins is if Allah wishes to forgive the person, He will do so. If He wants to punish the person, He will do so as He wish. The punishment of Allah is very severe.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. The Salaat will be valid.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
