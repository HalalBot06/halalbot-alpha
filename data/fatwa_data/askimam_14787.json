  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease help me out with this question.....there is a Aalima student who has been studying in a madrassafor few years, and alhamdullilah\nshe has good understanding of islam, and she fears the hell-fire and the hereafter punishment, and she knows clearly the\nimportance of Salaah, but she cant pray,her mind just doest be set to perform salaah, she can fast, teach,learn, be nice,\navoid backbiting, forgive people, read quran, read duroods, many other good deeds, but she just CANT perform her salaah\nit is as though between her and salaah there is a barrier. This is a major sin , she knows that and she alwayz prays to Allah\nto give her the ability to do her salaah, there was once were she did her salaah for about 2 weeks but then all of a sudden she went back\nto normal (during her 2 weekz of performing salaah, she thanked Allah soo much, and she became more poius)...what could\nthis poor sister do, is she doing something which Allah dont like and therefore she is unable to perform her salaah?...is there\nanything she could do so that she could do her salaah?........That is her only wish is to do her 5 daily salaah, but her body just\ndoesnt get up for salaah.\n\nI also wanted to ask, a women who bleeds most of the time, sometimes she bleeds a little  and sometimes she bleeds a lot\nand she is not sure if it is 'Haiz' blood or 'istahaza'....then what is the ruling for that.The blood is normal red, and she is always bleeding,\ntherefore she has to constantly use a sanatry towel.\n\ni alsowanted to ask what can one do to see Rasuallah s.a.w in a dream?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt seems as though she is affected with satanic wasaawis (whispers of Shaytaan). She should battle her Nafs and go against its dictates. This should be coupled with Dua before Allah.\n\n \n\nOne should consider her last habit. Assuming was 6 days. Now, at every monthly cycle she should calculate 6 days as Haidh and the balance as Istihaadha.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammed Kadwa\n\nChecked and Approved\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
