  "question": "Please explain which is the best type of Tawassul. I try to pray the Tahajjud prayer & fast for Allahs sake outside of Ramadhan",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have a close friend who tells me that by chanting Allahs name where they turn of the light & end up goin into some kind of ecstasy is better. I have been to such dhikr gatherings but i didnt like what i saw, with people swirling around on the floor banging themselves against sharps edges & not realising at all. I cant imagine to be honest the Prophet (pbuh) or his companions acting in this crazy manner. It seems very demonic & reminds me of what happens in churches where they jump up claiming to have the spirit in them & start talking in tongues. Im aware of hadith narrated by Ibn Abbas that Dhikr was heard after the completion of Salah so that he knew the prayers was finished but did this last for almost an hour & did they all lose their minds going into a state of what they call 'ecstasy'? Will I not inshaAllah gain a better reward from Allah by praying at night & fasting rather than chanting away like this? Your time is most appreciated in reading this question.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe purpose of any worship is to gain the pleasure of Allah. That can be\nachieved only by following the Sunnah of Rasulullah (SAW). Allah Taala says\nin the Quran, \"Say (Oh Mohammed) If you love Allah, follow me\". Tahajjud and\nfasting are Sunnats of Rasulullah (SAW). He used to fast often and spent\nmost of his nights in tahajjud. Following the Sunnah of Rasulullah (SAW) is\nthe only way to attain spirituality. It is incorrect to discard a sunnah and\nadopt a non-sunnah way to gain the pleasure of Allah. However, making Zikr\nis also an order of Allah and a practice of Rasulullah (SAW). He encouraged\nthe Sahaba to do so. The description of the zikr gathering explained by you\ndoes not seem appropriate. The purpose of zikr is to remember Allah and not\nto make oneself emotional. If that is the purpose then the purpose of zikr\nis defeated.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
