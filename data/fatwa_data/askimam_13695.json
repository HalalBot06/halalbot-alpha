  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. I would like to know if listening to nazms such as those by Inayet Petker is alright. I understand that some people send blessings and salutations to the prophet as if he is present. I am not of this view, but if the reciter of the nazm is of this view, is it ok for me to listen to it?\n\n2. If during witr salaat inÂ  ramadaan with jamaat, in the third rakaat when the imaam recites the takbeer for Qunoot and you mistakenly go into ruku, but realise before completetely going into ruku stand up and lift your hands for qunoot, is your salaah valid?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. In principle, if a Nazm or Nasheed does not have a musical tone, then it is permissible. If a Nazm has a musical tone, it will not be permissible even though there is nothing un-Islamic in the contents of the Nazm. It is incorrect to listen to the Nazm of a reciter who is of the belief that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] is present.\n\n2. The Salaat is valid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
