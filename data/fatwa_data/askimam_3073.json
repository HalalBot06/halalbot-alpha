  "question": "Was original Judaism and Chrisitanity actually 'Islam'? And why is then that they were not titled 'Muslims' but referred to as 'Jews' and 'Christians'?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYes, originally Judaism and Christianity was Islam as we know the religion\nby name today, however the term Islam was reserved exclusively for the\nFollowers of the Final Nabi Muhammad Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam. Therefore it\nwill be incorrect to refer to the original Jews and Christians i.e. the\nAhlul Kitab as Muslims.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
