  "question": "Assalaamu Alaikum, I am a 30-year old Pakistani currently studying in the USA. Upon my return to Pakistan, I plan to serve Islam and Muslims by joining Jamaat-e-Islami.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nUnlike my family that belongs to a certain religious seminary group that opposes Sayyid Maududi and his movement, I, in all honesty, consider Sayyid Maududi as one of the greatest Muslim scholars of all time and Jamaat Islami a bulwark against unislamic tides and influences in Pakistan. Moreover, JI is the only religious group that's completely free of sectarian biases. All the other religious parties are very parochial and sectarian i.e. Deobandi, Barelvi, Ahle-Hadith, Shia and so on. In all sincerity, I believe that the parochial religious parties have done considerable damage to the cause of Islam. Now to my question: please tell me in the light of the Islamic teachings how far could I go in antagonizing my father and uncles in \"rebelling\" against their parochial group and joining the rank of Jamaat Islami? Thank you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is very pleasing to note that you wish to serve Islam and the Muslims.%0D%0AThat is indeed a very noble deed that yields the proximity to Allah and His%0D%0ARasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) said, 'The person most dearest to me is he whose benefit (to%0D%0Apeople) is most widespread. May Allah Ta'ala accept your intentions and%0D%0Aaccept you for the service of the Deen, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0ABrother, there are many people serving the course of Deen, even Faasiqs.%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Allah Ta'ala will strengthen%0D%0Athis Deen even through a Faasiq (transgressor).' Our aims and objective%0D%0Ashould not be restricted to serve Deen but to have the service accepted in%0D%0Athe sight of Allah. In order to achieve that, we advise you search for that%0D%0Acriteria.%0D%0A%0D%0ABeing non-sectarian is certainly not a criteria of acceptance in the sight%0D%0Aof Allah Ta'ala as sects and denominations in Islam is expressly mentioned%0D%0Ain a Hadith wherein Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'My Ummah%0D%0Awill be divided into 72 sects. Only one will be correct and on truth.' Upon%0D%0Aenquiring which group will that be, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Asaid, 'That path on which I am on (Sunnah) and my companions (Sahaaba).'%0D%0AThat one sect is commonly known as Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaa`. Surely, they%0D%0Awill have to be selective and discriminate against the other sects which%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) declared as being deviated. In view%0D%0Aof the above explanation, we humbly advise you to reconsider your criteria%0D%0Aof being on Haqq and truth. It is grossly incorrect to join and group that%0D%0Ais amalgamated with members of mixed and incorrect beliefs. If any sect, for%0D%0Aexample, Barelvis believes in the Omnipresence of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam), do you expect the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaa` to be silent? If%0D%0Aany sect discredits the prophet's Sahaaba, for example, the Shi'as,%0D%0AMawdudis, etc. do you expect the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaa` to be silent? If%0D%0Athe Ahle Hadith do not have at least equal knowledge to the great jurists,%0D%0AImaam Maaliki, Imaam Hanafi, Imaam Shaaf'ee, Imaam Hanbali, is it correct%0D%0Afor them to pass judgments against the research of such oceans of knowledge?%0D%0A%0D%0ADear brother, your intention is noble but ensure it becomes noble. Kindly%0D%0Arefer attached.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
