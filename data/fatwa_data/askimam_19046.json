  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI heard that tax money is haram. And in foreign countries government is receiving tax from People and part of that tax is being given to refuge people. Most of the people in foreign do deferent business and the money of tax may be not halal.\n\nMy Mother is living and have Holland passport , She is old and she is sending us our monthly cost and government is paying for her due to her sickness and old enough for doing job however she is working two days a week in old people home.\n\nMy question is. Is the money that government is paying for my mother and my mother is sending it for us is halal?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\n1.      There are various types of taxes. Generally, when residing in any country, the government places certain taxes on the citizens. These taxes are in lieu of the many benefits one receives from the government. This is only one mechanism the State has adopted for its personal benefit. In this manner the State has many other ways of income, therefore to differentiate permissible from non permissible would be impossible. It is for this reason; permissibility has been given for us as Muslims to receive benefit whether it is in monetary form or any other form from the government and we are not required to carry out a detailed enquiry on the source of income.\n\n2.      The moneys given to your mother are permissible.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl. Ebrahim bin Khaliel Ahmed Desai,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
