  "question": "Shaving the babys hair and Aqeeqa for my daughter",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1.I just have a daughter four mnths ago alhamdulillah and i`m confused about shaving her head i wanted to ask you if this is fard or sunnat.\n\n2. i have not paid her aqiqa yet so my quiestion is how much time do i have to pay her aqiqa since she is 4 months already.\n\n3. I read in some book that if a husband hits his wife without any good reason she is allowed to leave the husband and that ALLAH will not punish her since she was being hit by her husband without justification, is this true?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1.)    To shave the head of a child is Mustahab (desirable), it should be done seven days after the birth of the child. If it is not done after seven days then it should be done seven days after that and so on. After cutting the hair, the hair should be weighed, and gold or silver equal to that weight should be given in charity.\n\n2.)    One should perform the Aqeeqah seven days after the child is born if not on that day then seven days after that and so on. It is preferable to perform the Aqeeqah before the child reaches the age of maturity. In your case since a girl was born, one sheep or one goat should be slaughtered. (The above two are Mustahab and one will not sinful if they are not performed.)\n\n (Fatawa Mahmoodiya, 17/517, Farooqiyah) , (Bahisti Zewar, 258, Makkiyah)\n\n3.)    It is not permissible for the wife to leave her husband if he hits her without any good reason. Rather, she should inform elders of the family and get a local Alim involved to reconcile between her and the husband. If the beating is extreme, as a temporary solution she can go to her parent’s or family’s house to avoid physical harm. However, this should be done in an attempt to solve the problem and not merely running away from husband. She will still remain the wife of the husband until and unless the husband issues a Shar’i Talaq.  \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
