  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI want to ask that if in the night after coming from work we feel sleepy and after wakingup we offer the Namaz of Isha at a time which is called Tahajjud or Sahar,      will that Namaz of Isha be a Kaza?\n\nSecond, can we cut our nails, hairs on Thursdays'?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe time for Esha Salaat is till the break of dawn. Upon the break of dawn, the time for Fajr Salaat sets in. If one performs Esha Salaat in the last portion of the night before the break of dawn, the Esha Salaat will be valid and Adaa (performed within the time for Esha Salaat).\n\nThe Fuqahaa have ruled that it is Makrooh to delay the Esha Salaat after half the night. However, if the delay is caused due to circumstances valid in Shari’ah, for example, travelling or extremely tired, then one will be excused.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
