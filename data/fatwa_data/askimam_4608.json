  "question": "Sometimes non-Muslims ask, why our Prayer is so elaborate, and why we perform the various actions. How do we explain?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOstensibly, it is 'elaborate' and lengthy. However, our Salaat only takes up\n2 - 2.5 hours of our 24 hour day. Allah Ta'ala has created us for the\nspecific purpose of worshipping Him. Devoting a few hours a day to Him,\ntherefore, seems minimal.\n\nEvery religion has a set of rituals through which the Almighty is worshiped.\nIslam also has a form of prayer consisting of certain actions like bowing\ndown, prostrating, etc. These acts of devotion were revealed upon Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) himself. This is why we carry out these\nactions.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nfor: FATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
