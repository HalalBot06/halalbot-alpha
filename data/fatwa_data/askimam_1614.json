  "question": "I like to know what is Ruh'hani?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy brother's daughter got very ill and they took her toa shiek and her Ruh'hani told the shiek she wants, gold ring, Ood Incense, white handkerchief and rose water. Are we aloud to believe in these sort of things.?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBlack magic (Sihr) is a reality and is mentioned in the Qur?aan and Ahaadith. If one suspects being affected by it, he/she should have him/herself examined by an Aamil (expert in identifying and curing black magic).\n\nHowever, in view of many incidents where bogus people have claimed to be experts in the matter and have cheated people, we advise you exercise precaution in identifying a realiable Aamil. Furthermore, one should not jump to conclusions of being affected by black magic due to getting ill. Other possibilities should be considered as well.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
