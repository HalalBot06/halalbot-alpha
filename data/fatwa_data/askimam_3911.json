  "question": "If one has wounds on one's face and arms can one do Tayamum?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti, It is stated in Nur al-Idaah that if half or more of the body is wounded then one may perform Tayamum instead of wudu (p.48). (in wudu , the 4 limbs which are compulsory will have to be taken into consideration And in ghusl the entire body has to be taken into consideration).The question which I have is that what if the wounded parts are the arms and/or the face, how can one then do Tayamum ? Because in order to do so one will have to rub sand/ earth onto one's wounds. Please could u enlighten me with the correct ruling.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn order for the Tayammum to be valid, it is not necessary to have a layer\nof sand on the hands after striking the hands on the earth.\n\nIn fact, it is advisable to shake off any rough particles of the earth from\nthe hands before passing them over the face and hands. That will not cause\nany harm to the wounds.\n\nmand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
