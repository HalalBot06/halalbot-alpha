This is\nall one can really do. If both the parties are sincere then Allah Ta'ala\nwill definitely make a way out and reconcile them.\n\nIf, on the other hand, after making all efforts, the marriage does not work\nout, then the couple should in an honourable manner separate. However, at\nfirst, try one's best to reconcile.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nfor: FATWA DEPT."
