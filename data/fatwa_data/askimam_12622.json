I have heard from somewhere that its meaning is \"Like Hazrat Ali(RA)\". .\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is obvious that she perpetrated a major sin and she should make a resolution never to repeat this despicable act and she must also make Tawbah.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. She should rather remain silent instead of disclosing what happened.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Both are responsible for the children. If he is not around, she must take care of them and he must provide financial help.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Surely, she must make Tawbah. It is, in fact, compulsory upon her to make Tawbah.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Yes, he is allowed to live with her even if she does not make Tawbah. Her sin of adultery does not affect the validity of the marriage.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. If her husband permits her to live with her parents, there is no problem. If he does not permit it, she is not allowed to do so.%0D%0A%0D%0A7. Obviously, she is a woman who had the choice. She is responsible. However, he is partly to be blamed as well. Nonetheless, his actions cannot be used to justify her sins.%0D%0A%0D%0A8. Yes, it is permitted provided it is a bathroom and not with a toilet.%0D%0A%0D%0A9. Al-Izzah (with an Ain and zaa) means glory, honour or high rank. Aliza as spelt by you is a name unknown to me.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Kadwa%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0Achecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)%0D%0A"
