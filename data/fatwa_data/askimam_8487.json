All the references you gave discusses something totally different. However it is not permissible to kill a non-Believer if he/she does not accept Islam. A person cannot be forced to accept our faith as guidance is only from Allah Ta?ala.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf\nDarul Ifta ?
