  "question": "Is it fardh on the muslims of america britain etc. to go for jihad in afghanistan ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer below our standard reply to similar queries.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nIn principle, if a Muslim country is attacked, they have a right to defend\nthemselves and declare Jihaad. Jihad will be Fardh-e-Ain upon the males of\nthat area (in this instance, Afghanistan).\n\nIf they are unable to defend themselves, then the obligation extends to\nthose closest to them, Pakistan. Thereafter, the obligation will extend\naccordingly."
