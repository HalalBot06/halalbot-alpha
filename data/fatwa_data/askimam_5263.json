  "question": "Whilst fasting which of the following break the fast and which do not, Eye drops, eardrops, nose drops, and asthma inhaler?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am an Aalim working in a hospital here in the U.K. I am preparing a fact sheet for Muslim Patients about medication during Ramadhan. I am aware of the Fataawa our Ulama and Mufti Sahebs have given saying: Eye drops do not break fast. Eardrops do break fast. Nose drops do break fast. Asthma Inhaler does break fast. The problem I face is that in another hospital, a similar guidance sheet was issued to Muslims and the Imam there gave advice that it is O.K. to take all of the above during Fast. I decided to look into this further. As I understand it, the underlying principle is that anything which benefits the stomach will break the fast, (correct me if I?m wrong). I?ve asked a few practicing Muslim Dr.?s and they say, ?Our Fatwa regarding Ear drops does not make sense as it has no connection with the stomach, therefore it should not break the fast.? ?The Fatwa regarding eye drops does not make sense as it has a connection or a passage to the stomach, therefore should break the fast.? ?The Fatwa regarding the salbutamol inhaler does not make sense as it goes through the throat into the veins and circulates in the blood and does not benefit the stomach, therefore should not break the fast.?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn order to clearly understand the response to your query, one needs to%0D%0Aunderstand that some Jurists, after much consideration and research, have%0D%0Aconcluded that when any liquid, food or medicine reaches, ingests and%0D%0Asettles in one of the three considered cavaties of the human body viz. the%0D%0Athroat, the stomach, the intestines, nullifies the fast.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is important to note that the Jurists have also identified other%0D%0Aapertures and pathways which lead to any of the above three major cavaties.%0D%0ASome of these apertures are the ears, nose, and the anal aperture. Of note%0D%0Ais the fact that the medical profession has a slight disagreement with the%0D%0AFuqaha with regards to:-%0D%0A* The ear: whilst some Jurists considered the outer ear to have a direct%0D%0Apathway to the throat, subsequently reaching the stomach, the E.N.T experts%0D%0Aare of the opinion that there is no link. Their view is that the only time%0D%0Awhen any liquid will pass through from the outer ear to the middle ear is%0D%0Awhen the tympanic membrane (eardrum) is perforated. * Regarding this%0D%0Adifference, contemporary Jurists like Mufti Rafi Uthmani (D.B) strongly%0D%0Aadvise that the views of the E.N.T experts of our time be accepted, since%0D%0Athere is no certainty with regards to the ear having a passage to the%0D%0Athroat. We should therefore refer this matter to the medical experts. (Refer%0D%0Ato Dhaabitul-mufattiraat fi majaalit-tadaawi p.g 54)%0D%0A* The eyes: the medical profession clearly state that a narrow duct links up%0D%0Athe eye cavity with the throat via the nose. Regarding this difference%0D%0AHazrat Mufti Rafi Uthmani Saheb explains that:- = Ahadith have proven that%0D%0Athe use of surma and%2For eye drops does not nullify the fast. (One should%0D%0Abear in mind that after something is clearly proven from the Quraan or the%0D%0AAhaadith, one is oblidged to accept it whether it makes sense to him or not)%0D%0Aadditionally, this duct is so narrow that whatever passes through it from%0D%0Athe eye is (insignifant and) negligible. ( Ibid pg.59)%0D%0A%0D%0AAs far as the inhaler is concerned, in the light of the above one can safely%0D%0Aconclude that all medication taken by inhalation necessarily pass through%0D%0Athe throat before they eventually settle in the lungs, thus nullifying the%0D%0Afast. Additionally, some of this medication also finds its way to the%0D%0Astomach.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Na'eem Motala%0D%0Afor: FATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
