  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nFirst, I was In need of money to cover some situations that I went through. I over worked my self at my job. It happened to meet a highly educated person at our local masjed. We discussed some ahadeathes together once. After awhile my work schedule changed and didn’t have time to go to the local masjed but I kept praying in my job if I’m there or at home. The educated guy asked about me several times in masjed. I went to sala’t al gomoa’a and he asked me about the reason behind me not coming to the masjed as much as I used to. I told him my situation. He offered me to move with him in his apartment, I did that. He said to me that I’m his first priority in his life. He wants to help me to reach my goals and be a successful person. Now after awhile, he asked me to quit my job and work with him, I did that. School started, we arranged the timing for school and work together. His secretary doesn’t do a complete job. I have to go finish after her every day. After awhile of doing that and not paying attention to school I start running behind with my subjects at school. I noted him many times about what is happening to me but I didn’t get any results. He said that I have plenty of time to study, but I don’t use it on the right way. He might be right but by the time I get home, I’m dead tired and need some rest. On the other hand he is strict about going to sleep early. By the time I weak up from my knap, I put my books together for the next day; its already time to go to sleep again. Second, this person is single “educated person” sometimes or almost every time I go to sleep he rub on my private part. At the first time happened, I walk up real scared thinking that something is in the bed or a gen was touching me. It starts happening every day and by the time I weak up on it, he acted as if he is in a deep sleep snoring. At the next day I mentioned to him what I feel happening to me but he said you must be dreaming.  However, he is a religious person.\n\n  1-     What should I do about my school?\n\n2-     Yes, he is taking care of me but not giving me the time to study, what should I do?\n\n3-     With his actions in the night, what should I do?\n\n4-     Should I leave him and start again my life?\n\n5-     I feel like he is abusing me by using me more toward his office than encouraging me in school matters.\n\n6-     I feel like I’m a failing/loser with him instead of a successful person. \n\n Ø      Please provide me with your avice, Dua’a, guidness.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are two aspects to this query\n\nA) school work B) religious person\n\nAt the outset, it is important to understand that priority must be given to your schoolwork. You state that you have been employed in the school……. If the secretary does not complete her work, it is not your responsibility to do so. The administration will address the problem with her directly. It is obvious when you complete her work, she will become lazy and leave the work for you to complete. You should never burden yourself with the work of lazy people.\n\nWe do not know if you are an employee of the school or a student. If you are a student, you should concentrate on your studies and not allow any outside interference to disturb you. You have this opportunity to study and make the best of it. This opportunity will never return. Do not involve yourself in any aspect of administration. This is the cancer for students. If you are an employ of the school, you should carry out all your responsibilities diligently. Do not falter as that could leave a bad impression about you.\n\nFurthermore, if this so-called religious man is making evil advancements to you, he is not religious. He is Shaytaan in the form of a human. You should immediately sever all relations with him and move out from his apartment. These evil advancements begin with fondling and thereafter develop into other filthy and Haraam acts.\n\nMay Allah protect you and guide you, Aameen.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMl.
