  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamu Alaikum\n\nRespected Mufti\n\nA madressa educates 100 children and specifies a fee of R250 per annum. The running costs are R50 000 per annum. Parents who cannot afford the fees sign an authorization to use Zakaat funds to pay for the education. This zakaat form merely states that zakaat will be used to pay fees without specifying the amount. If 40 parents opt to pay and 60 accept zakaat then R10 000 is raised from fee paying parents and the other R40 000 is raised from the 60 children on zakaat. That means fees transferred for every child on zakaat is in excess of R650. An Aalim has told me this is permissible as there is no specification on the forms that the parents accepting zakaat sign as to the value of zakaat assistance. This still seems to me that those children of parents who are sahib-e-nisaab and pay their fees are still subsidised by the children on zakaat. Please Advise\n\n \n\nJazakallah\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram\n\n \n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\n \n\nIf the Madrasah had fixed the annual fee to be R250, it may not use R650 for the student eligible to receive Zakaat. It may only use R250.\n\n \n\nThe alternative would be to charge all students R650 per annum. Those who feel this fee to be high may be granted any fair discount. As for students that are eligible for Zakaat, the full R650 may be applied from Zakaat funds.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMoulana Emraan Vawda\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\nThe guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\nEducation and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\nIslam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\nWhen one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\nMuslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\nWe have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\nIf you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\nIf that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\nRasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit”.\n\n \n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
