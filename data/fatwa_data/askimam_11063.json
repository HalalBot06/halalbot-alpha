  "question": "Parents want to make my Nikah with a girl b'coz I am their only son. But I don't want to make intercourse after Nikah. Is it must to do intercourse with your wife after Nikah or it is not must?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nConsider 1st what stops you from considering marriage to this girl?%0D%0Aa) Because you are forced to?%0D%0Ab) Are you interested in someone else?%0D%0Ac) Does she not look appealing to you?%0D%0Ad) Is she not compatible and most of all%0D%0Ae) Is she not pious?%0D%0A%0D%0AAddress your feelings and situations. Clarify this with yourself and make Istikhaara for marriage. Satisfy this aspect too then ask an elder to intervene for you with your parents to discuss the matter! However a piece of advice. Don't destroy another woman's life just for the sake of marriage and then ill treat her or do not fulfil her duties and rights.%0D%0A%0D%0AOn your second question re: intercourse after Nikaah. Do you have a problem as in dysfunction in this area? Are you impotent? If not how do you intend fulfilling a basic need of man? How would you feel if a woman had to deprive you of your need and duties. Hence consider marriage in a positive wholesome light to live a happy and successful life. Kindly clarify your question with reason to enable a clearer reply.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A2SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
