  "answer": "QUESTION\ni have a question regarding Fajr salat. sometimes i do not go to sleep after isha salat, and stay up till fajr. i sometimes pray fajr at home, sometimes i drive to our masjid. is this ok? or is it preferred to sleep after isha and wake up for fajr?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHadhrat Sulaymaan ibn Abi Hatmah (Radhiallaahu Anhu) is one of the eminent\npeople of the early days of Islam. He was born in the lifetime of Nabi\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), but was too young then to have the honour of\nlistening to any Hadith from Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nDuring the Khalifat of Hadhrat Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu), he was made\nincharge of the market. One day, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) found him\nmissing in Fajr Salaat. Hadhrat Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) went to his house\nand enquired from his mother why Sulaymaan was not present in Fajr. She\nreplied, 'He kept saying Nafl Salaat throughout the night and sleep\noverpowered him at the time of Fajr.' At this, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiallaahu\nAnhu) remarked, 'I would prefer my Fajr with Jamaat to my offering Nafl\nSalaat all night long.' (Fadhaail-e-Aamaal chapter3)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
