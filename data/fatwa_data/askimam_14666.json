  "question": "he knew what he was doing was wrong and engaged in great sins",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nASSALAMALYCOOM , my question is if one has missed his prayers on and off for months over a period of many years, and he knew what he was doing was wrong and engaged in great sins such as stealing, pornography, zina, backbiting and masterbation countlessly and now he is almost 26 years old and wants to make peace with his lord, is it possible. I want to start over from the beginning. I want to \"re-learn\" everything and this time hopefully put it into practice. My body has taken a toll on the things which I used to do, as a third of my hair is gray already and my heart hurts, both physically and emotionally. Ever since I was a child I used to wonder about ALLAH and his power and why was I led to do these things then. Is it because of western society. Also I consider myself a big failure. But I believe in ALLAH and the meeting of the last day. What would I do to redeem my self. What is the nyaat or intention one say's to make up those prayers. Any help would be appreciated for I fear the HELLFIRE and I don't want to go there. THANKS\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nDear brother, your belief in Allah and meeting Allah on the last day is the background to change and reformation. There is no get away from that. Do what ever you want and go where ever you want, our final return is to Allah. Alhamdulillah, you do believe in that. That has inspired you to change and reform.\n\n \n\nBrother, Allah is Rahman. He is Raheem. He is Kareem. He is most loving soft and compassionate. He loves those who sin the most and come to him with a crying heart. Turn to Allah and beg His forgiveness. Don’t despair. His mercy is very wide. Be rest assured that you will be forgiven even if your sins were equivalent to the foams of all the oceans of the world and all the pebbles in the desert. The only condition is regret the wrong and make a firm intention never to commit those sins again. When you are sincere and you seek Allah’s forgiveness you will be like a new born child. Forget the past and move on with life. Don’t turn back. Educate yourself on Deen. Perform your five daily Salah. Recite Quran everyday. Make zikr, Allah Allah verbally and from your heart 300 times everyday in the morning and in the evening in isolation. Take Allah’s name slowly from your heart. You will feel close to Allah and enjoy peace and contentment. Allah say’s-the heart feels content with the zikr of Allah. \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nThe ask imam site will not process questions from October 23 till October 27.
