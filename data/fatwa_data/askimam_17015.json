Allah Ta’ala our Master and Sustainer has created us, and as His servants it is incumbent upon us to show our servitude (abdiyat) to Him and carry out His commandments without question. However, whilst it is incumbent to follow the commands of Allah Ta’ala without reason and logic, this does not necessitate that the commands of Allah Ta’ala is void of rational.\n\nAllah Ta’ala says;\n“And obey Allah Ta’ala and the Messenger so you may obtain mercy”. (3:132)\n“And obey Allah Ta’ala and His Messenger and do not dispute lest you lose courage and your strength departs, and be patient”. (8:46)\n“By Allah, they can have no faith, until they make you (O’ Muhammad (Sallallahu Alyhi Wa Sallam) a judge in all disputes between them and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission”. (4:65)\n\nAs for the questions mentioned in ones e-mail Allah Ta’ala says;\n\n“They ask you O’ Muhammad (Sallallahu Alyhi Wa Sallam) what is lawful for them (as food). Say lawful for you are At-Tayyibat” (pure, halal, wholesome food). (05:04)\n“Forbidden for you are; Al-Maitah (dead animals not slaughtered) blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which the name of Allah Ta’ala has not been mentioned while slaughtering”. (05:03)\n“O’ you who believe intoxicants (wine, drugs etc.) and gambling …are an abomination of Shaytan’s handiwork. So avoid that (intoxicants and gambling etc.) so you may be successful. Shaytan wants to incite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah Ta’ala and from Al-Salat. So will you not then abstain?” (05:90, 91)\n\nIn today’s world, the evils that have been borne from drugs and alcohol have stained the history of many lives and are continuing to ruin the lives of many more. Consider the following;\n\nAlcohol and Drugs is an addition.\nIt causes physical as well as mental illnesses.\nIt’s a waste of time and money.\nIt Ruin family lives and is a disturbance to lives of others.\nMore than 13 million Americans use illegal drugs.\nMore than 2 million are known to abuse prescription drugs.\n60 million are hooked on cigarettes.\n33 million binge on alcohol and\n12 million are heavy drinkers. (Drugs statics)\n\nThe swine is a grass fleshy animal, which combines between the wild and domestic features. It eats everything and it is a gluttonous animal, which sweeps away anything in the green field and barn. It eats the garbage, wastes & filthy remains in a greedy & gluttonous manner. It is also a wild animal that eats rats and mice, as well as the corpses of its own. (1)\n\nImam Al-Dummeri (2) states that: the swine is a fierce animal with excessive copulation and has a lustful nature and does not have a specific mate. Consider the following research of scientists regarding the swine;\n\nScientists have reached amazing results in this respect (4) Is it not amazing to know that the swine is a rich habitat for more than 450 epidemic diseases, and the swine plays the role of an intermediary agent for transmission of 57 diseases to the human being, let alone the diseases which come as result of eating its meat such as dyspepsia, arteriosclerosis and else.\n\nThese diseases could be transmitted from the swine to the human being by different means;\n\nBy way of daily contact during its breeding or by way of dealing in its products (these are considered occupational diseases). They are not less than 32 epidemics which affect in most cases labors of the ranches, Slaughterhouses and also veterinarians. These epidemics include some kinds of fungi, moaning, worms, moaning dysentery, spinal Japanese fever and the stomatitis.\nBy way of contamination of the food & drink with the swine’s wastes which are not less than 28 diseases that includes the dysentery, scares, hedgehog & liver worms, tapeworm, hookworm, taenia solium, coiled silk worm and else.\nBy means of eating the swine meat and its products which are more than 16 epidemic diseases including the whiteners disease, the swine resicles disease, Maltese fever, liver worm, wile disease, round worm (Trchocephalus), tape worm, cancer & else. This confirms that which scientist Kroll had stated; “the forbiddance imposed on Muslims (not to touch the swine) needs no justification” (3).\n\nThe Swine’s Parasites: -\n\nWe have known how the swine hosts in its body a big number of parasites and that more than 50 kind of them affect the human being (5). It is classified as diseases, which are common between animals & human beings (Zoonosis) and can be classified within the following groups:\nThe viral and gremial diseases: -\nThis includes the rabies, yellow fever, maltase fever and tuberculosis. But the most important ones, which the swine transmits are: -\nThe Meningeal and blood poison and this comes as result of infection with the streptococcus discovered in 1968 which gave explanation to the obscure cases of death that occurred in Denmark and Holland at that time (6).\n\nIt becomes obvious that the said germs are fatal to Man’s health and causes Meningitis sickness by exertion of certain toxins in the sick person. The persons who suffered from this disease and escaped the death after hard treatment remained with permanent deafness and lack of balance.\n\nThe crape Diseases (7) whereas Dr. Hans Hietrich confirms that the Crape virus which transmits from the swine is the most toxic element. He quotes The Viral Researches Institute (8) in London that “{the crape virus) exists in abundance in the swine’s lung which composes the sausage process. The viruses, which exist in the body’s vital organs, could easily attack in a form of epidemic disease when the circumstances do allow. This happens in cold climate and in lack of sun rays such as the one that occurred in Germany after the Second World War when the people of Germany ate the gifts of swine meat and its by-products given to them by USA.\nThe swine Flu (8). This disease spreads in form of an epidemic that affects millions of people. The serious effects of this disease is the brain infection, heart hypertrophy (enlargement) .The world witnessed the last hit of this disease in 1918 where more than 20 people had suffered from it.\nThe swine erysipeias (9). This disease transfers from the swine to Butchers and Tanners etc. The disease appears in form of very painful and big burning red spots in the hands accompanied by general symptoms such as fever, chill and infection of the lymph nodes and glands.\n\n The diseases that communicate by the Protozoa (6-10): -\n\nThe swine is regarded as the hosting habitat for two kinds of protozoa called the Trypanosoma.The first one is the sleeping sickness parasite of Africa and the second one causes Shagas sickness, of South America. The swine is also considered the largest host of a kind of amoebic dysentery. In fact the most dangerous parasite is the one called Balantidium Coli, which lives inside the large intestines of the swine & monkeys.\n\nThe rare chances of contacts between the monkeys and the human being make the swine the sole source, which transfers what is called the Dysenteric sickness. This is an occupational disease which affects labours who follow up the swine’s breeding or slaughtering where their hands get contaminated then contaminate the food which goes to those labour’s intestine and causes repeated and severe diarrhea as well as colic, dizziness and loss of weight. This matter may leads to appearance of ulceration in the intestine and ultimately to the death of the patient.\n\nThe diseases that communicate by the insects & acaridae (6): -\n\nThe swine is regarded as host for a number of parasites that affect the human being. These parasites include some kinds of mosquitoes, flees and pediculus & among them is the Tesi Tesi fly which transfers parasite of the sleep sickness and some kinds of skin flies whose larva affects the mouth, eye, nose and open wounds. It includes some kinds of acarideae similar to the scabies parasite.\n\nIn view of the above, the wisdom and reality of Allah Ta’ala’s saying namely;\n\n“Forbidden for you are Al-Maitah (dead animals not slaughtered) blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which the name of Allah Ta’ala has not been mentioned while slaughtering”. (05:03)\n\ncan well be understood, being one of the ample miracles of the Quran. A book revealed 1400 years ago.\n\nIt is important that as Muslims we deal with the disbelievers in an appropriate way and avoid being harsh and disrespectful to them. The character that Nabi (Sallallahu Alyhi Wa Sallam) showed and observe with the disbelievers invited them to Islam. Therefore one should answer the questions of the person in question with wisdom and respect and also refer him to a trustworthy Alim.\n\nThe references of research;\n\nDr. Ahmed Jawad in his book (Al-Khinzeer Bain Mezzan Al-Sharia wa Minzar Al-Ilim) Dar Al-Salaam 1987.
