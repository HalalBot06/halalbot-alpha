  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome say, they can?t touch the Qur?an, while some say, they can read it. --Specially when women teach a lot of kids at their houses, they can?t give 1 week holiday to 10 kids. Also, what kind of zikr can they do and shouldn?t do? Is there a Hadith that prohibits them from stepping into the mosque during this period? WOULD SINCERELY REQUEST YOU, to provide references in terms of Hadith with your response(s).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA woman in her menses has to abstain from the following: Salaat, entering\nthe Musjid, touching and reciting the Qur'aan and from sexual intercourse.\n\nShe may engage in any form of Dhikr. Also, she may recite the Du'aas\nmentioned in the holy Qur'aan. However, these are recited as Du'aas and not\nas Tilaawat (recitation). If she is a teacher, she may teach the children by\nreciting one or two words of the Qur'aan at a time. Yes, there is a Hadith\nprohibiting women from entering the Musjid during their menses.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
