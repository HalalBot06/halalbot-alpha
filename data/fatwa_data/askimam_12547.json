  "answer": "QUESTION\nFrom my understanding he used to always pray in increments of 2 Rakaat whenever he offered any Nafl or Sunnah Salaat.

We will give a reference for each:\n\n4 Rakaat: Sahih Bukhari (No.3376)\n\n6 Rakaat and 8 : Sharhu Ma'anil Aathaar of Tahawi Vol.1 Pg.364(Ilmiyyah), Sunanul Kubra of Nasai (No.1414),\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl.
