  "question": "Is insurance haram? Even if it is required by law? What if you need insurance to pay medical bills which can exceed thousands of dollars?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAll forms of Insurance is not permissible since these companies are based on Interest and gambling.\n\nThe Noble Qur√£n says, ''O` You who believe!! Verily intoxicants, gambling and the casting of arrows for luck are filth from the works of Shaitaan. So avoid all this so that you may attain success. (Qur'an 5:90)\n\n'O` You who believe, fear Allah and leave out that which remains from Riba (Interest), if you are believers. And if you do not do it, then take notice of war from Allah and His Rasool. (Qur'an 2:279)\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
