  "answer": "QUESTION\nAre there any special Duas and Namaz we can ask and perform for Iraq and its people; Any prayers in that can be held in congregration? What part can a muslim in the U.S take to stand against the wrong and mischeif? Could the Hadith referring \"The Euphrates will Disclose a Mountain of Gold\" be relavant to this current \"War on Iraq\" situation? If so, does it mention that 99 out of 100 shall die? Who is this reffering to (Muslims or Kufaar)?Can you please state and elaborate more this hadeeth and any other relavant information? Is Jihad compulsary upon us for this situation?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe situation in Iraq is sad. At this stage, the Ummat should divert their attention to Allah and make Du?aa for the best outcome of the war. Our interest should be advancing the course of Islam, rather than anything else.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
