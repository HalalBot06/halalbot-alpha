  "question": "In Ramadan the reward for a good deed is multiplied by 70 times,if somebody get married in ramadhan will he get the reward 70 times ,is it preferable to marry in Ramadhan?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe reward of 70 times refers to acts of pure ibaadat such as salaah and sadaqah. Nikah does not fall under this category.\n\nHowever, Allah Ta?ala rewards one according to one?s intention. If the intention is correct and sincere, there is nothing strange in receiving more than 70 fold reward.\n\nThere is no specific month preferred for nikah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
