  "answer": "QUESTION\n \nThis question is in reference to your answer given to question # 3880 on www.ask-imam.com\nAlso, this question is regarding explanation for a certain hadith I came across.\n \nThe hadith is as follows: (I had got this hadith from http://muttaqun.com/malehijab.html )\n \nSaid Ibn 'Abbas, \"The Prophet ordered us to prostrate on seven bodily parts and not to fold back the hair or clothing: the forehead, the hands, the knees and the feet.\" In another wording, the Prophet said, \"I have been ordered to prostrate on seven bodily parts: the forehead, and he pointed to his nose, the hands, the knees and the ends of the feet.\" (Related by al-Bukhari and Muslim.) In another narration, he said, \"I have been ordered to prostrate on seven bodily parts and not to fold back the hair or clothing: the forehead, the nose, the hands, the knees and the feet.\" (Related by Muslim and an-Nasa'i.)\n \nThe website from where I got this hadith seems to say that folding the pants up is forbidden.\nI truly realize the great importance of keeping the pants above ankles and I am doing my best to maintain that MashaAllah; however, in the past I used to fold my pants during sala'at up due to them being long.\nPlease let me know a correct interpretation of the above hadith, especially the highlighted parts and also,\nplease clarify to me if what I had been doing by folding my pants up is a forbidden act or an allowable actin Islam? This will indeed give me tremendous mental peace InshaAllah.\n \nJazakaAllah khairan\nMay Allah (swt) bless you all and give you wonderful health and long lives to continue serving the deen of Islam InshaAllah and helping lay people like us to understand Islam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe Hadith does not refer to folding the pants above the ankles. The Hadith refers to those who gather their clothes in salaah to avoid them becoming dirty when Salaah is performed on open ground. (Umdatul Qaari vol. 4 Pg. 555 Darul Hadith)\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
