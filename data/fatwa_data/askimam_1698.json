  "question": "Is it recommended to miss Tarawih namaaz and go to a Dawah lecture instead?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am under the impression that Tarawih Namaaz is more important during the month of Ramadaan than partaking in a Dawah lecture which can be visited during the fasting hours.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour understanding is correct. Taraweeh salaah is an emphasised practice and\nshould not be missed.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
