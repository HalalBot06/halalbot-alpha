  "question": "Is it permissible to drink tawaiz water and wear it around my neck if they have both numbers and Allah's name written on them.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question is \"Is it permissible to drink tawaiz water and wear it around my neck if they have both numbers and Allah's name written on them.\nI have some medical issues and one of te Molvi Sahab told us that despite of medical issues  there is also some kind of amal on me . I am also having pain in my shoulders and he specifically mention this pain and gave some tawaiz which have numbers on them but they also have some Allah's name .I can only read some of them because of the writing .And there is also something written on the back of side of the tawaiz which is not readable . My concern is about the numbers written on them .If there were Allah's name only I would not have any doubt in my mind and I would use them.But I believe that Allah's name  cannot be replaced by numbers.But in this case tawaiz have both numbers and Allah's name that makes me confuse.\nPlease advice me what to do? I will really appreciate your help and advice.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAllah Taãla says in the Noble Qurãn, 'In the Qurãn is (spiritual, physical) cure for people.'\n\nThe opening chapter of the Noble Qurãn, Surah Faatiha is also called the chapter of Shifaa.\n\nIt is recorded in the Bukhari Shareef vol. 1 p. ,\n\n'A ruler of a certain clan was stung by a creature, the people of the area requested the Sahaaba to cure him, one Sahaabi read Surah Faatiha and blew on the affected area and cured the ruler. The Prophet (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) even praised the Sahaabi for doing so.\n\nFrom the above quotations, it is clear that the verses of the Noble Qurãn is a means of cure.\n\nTreating oneself with Taweez containing verses of the Qurãn or numbers resembling verses of Quran or duas.is similar to treating oneself with medication. By using medication, one merely places his trust in Allah Taãla and use the medication as a means of cure. The effect in the means is with the Will of Allah Taãla so, too is the usage of the Taweez.\n\nThe art of making Taweez is a science independent to other known sciences. People who have studied this science are most knowledgeable to explain its vast understanding. One thing must be outlined at the outset is that anyone practising the making of Taweez cannot ascribe (in his method and application) partners with Allah Taãla.\n\nAny act of Kufr is unacceptable in Islam. The people during the time of Jaahiliyya had an incorrect belief that the stars and planets cause rainfall, but the Prophet (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) dismissed that. The drawings and illustrations used in Taweez are like the concepts used in geometry, etc. to arrive at a solution.\n\nIn conclusion, consider the following Hadith: Abu Khuzaymah (Radhiallaahu Ánhu) narrates from his father that he asked Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam), 'Inform me about Rukan (blowing in water and Taweez), medication, and means of security, does it change Taqdeer (predestination)? He replied, 'They (all the above) are within Taqdeer. (Mishkãt pg. 22) \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
