  "question": "There are some words in the Qur’an like Aleem (w/Alif), and A’leem (w/Ain). During the Qiraat I get confused as to which is which. Is there significant difference in the meaning?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow do I avoid making such mistakes, does this warrant Sajda-Sauw? Please provide a list of words of this type that occur in the Qur?an that start with Alif or A?in with their meanings.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In these 2 words, there is great difference in the meaning. The one with Alif means painful or severe and it always comes with the word punishment in the Qur?aan. The one with ayn means All-knowing and this can only be attributed to Allah, because it is the Sifat of Allah.\n\n2. You should learn the difference in appearance between Alif and Ayn and also the difference in pronunciation. Before commencing with any Qiraat you should recite to someone who is well learned in the faculty of Qiraat and you should also check up in the Qur?aan before recitation.\n\n3. Salaat will be valid and no Sajda-e-Sahw will be necessary.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
