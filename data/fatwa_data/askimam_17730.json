  "question": "Does paying my wife Mahr via credit card invalidate the Nikah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy wife and I had our Niccah recently, but we have a sincere concern about its legitimacy. Basically, the money I gave my wife for her dowry was paid for via a credit card. Also, the money used to pay the Imam who performed our Niccah came from a credit card. Does this invalidate our Islamic marriage? If so, what can I do about it? I love my wife and she loves me and we want this to be resolved in our hearts so we know our marriage will be recognized in the eyes of Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta’ala).  Please my brother give us your advice and guidance to assist us in resolving this matter.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIn order for the Nikaah to be considered legitimate, the Nikaah has to be conducted in the presence of two Muslim witnesses (men) who are free, sane and mature. If two men were not present, then one man and two women will suffice.\n\nولا ينعقد نكاح المسلمين إلا بحضور شاهدين حرين عاقلين بالغين مسلمين رجلين أو رجل وامرأتين عدولا كانوا أو غير عدول أو محدودين في القذف\n( Al-Hidaya vol.1 pg306, Shirka)\n\nIt is not a prerequisite for the Mahr (dowry) to be mentioned in the Nikaah contract or for it to be paid in advance for the validity of the Nikaah, even though it is still binding on him to pay it.\n\n( ويصح النكاح وإن لم يسم فيه مهرا ) ؛ لأن النكاح عقد انضمام وازدواج لغة فيتم بالزوجين ، ثم المهر واجب شرعا إبانة لشرف المحل فلا يحتاج إلى ذكره لصحة النكاح\n( Al-Hidaya vol.1 pg323, Shirka)\n\nIf the Mahr was paid via credit card, it does NOT invalidate the Nikaah. It is also not a condition to pay the Imaam for the validity of the Nikaah.\n\nNote: It will only be permissible to use the credit card facility if there are sufficient funds available. If sufficient funds are not available, it will result in an interest bearing loan which is prohibited.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
