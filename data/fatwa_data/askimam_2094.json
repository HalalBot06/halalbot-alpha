  "question": "Please explain the Tafseer & Ahadith and circumstances of the revelation of Ayat Nos.33 & 56 of Sura e Ahzaab.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n'And stay in your homes, and do not display yourselves like that of the%0D%0Atimes of ignorance. And establish Salaat, and give Zakaat and obey Allah and%0D%0AHis Messenger. Allah Ta'ala wishes only to remove evil deeds and sins from%0D%0Ayou, O Members of the family of the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Aand to purify you thoroughly.' (Ahzaab 33)%0D%0A%0D%0AAlthough the wives of the noble Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) are%0D%0Abeing addressed in the abovementioned verse, the command applies to all%0D%0Awomen. (Qurtubi vol.7 pg.117). It is reported from Hadhrat Umm Naylah that%0D%0AAbu Barzah (Radhiallaahu Anhu) came home and did not find his wife there.%0D%0AHis family members informed him that she was gone to the Musjid. When she%0D%0Areturned, he reprimanded her saying that Allah has prohibited women from%0D%0Agoing outdoors, and commanded them to stay in their homes. They should not%0D%0Afollow the Janaaza (to the cemetery) nor got to the Musjid, or join the%0D%0Acongregation for Jummu'ah Salaat. (Darrul Manthoor vol.6 pg.600)%0D%0A%0D%0A%3EFrom this Hadith, we can clearly see that the command of concealing oneself%0D%0Ain one's home is not confined to the wives of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam), but applies to all women. Women have been prohibited to come out%0D%0Aof their homes in order to prevent intermingling of the sexes which leads to%0D%0Amany evils and vices. When there is a possibility of intermingling and%0D%0A'Fitna' (corruption) women will be prevented from even coming to the Musjid,%0D%0Aas this Sahaabi (Radhiallaahu Anha) did. (Bayaanul Qur'aan vol.9 pg.44).%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the verse under discussion, women have been commanded to remain in their%0D%0Ahomes. Yes, they may come out when necessary, as mentioned in a Hadith of%0D%0ASahih Muslim. However, even then they should come out without adorning and%0D%0Abeautifying themselves and wearing simple clothing as they do in their%0D%0Ahomes. (Ibn Katheer vol.4 pg.248). It is reported from Ibn Abbaas%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhu) that there was a space of 1000 years between Hadhrat Nuh%0D%0A(Alayhis salaam) AND Hadhrat Idrees (Alayhis salaam). During this period,%0D%0Athe earth was inhabited by two progenies of Hadhrat Aadam (Alayhis salaam).%0D%0AOne lived in land and the other in the mountains. The men who lived in the%0D%0Amountains were handsome and the women ugly. As for the inhabitants of the%0D%0Aland, the women were beautiful and the men ugly. Once Shaytaan came to one%0D%0Aof the inhabitants of the land in the form of a man and offered to serve him%0D%0Awhich he accepted. While serving this person, Shaytaan made a flute. When he%0D%0Aplayed it, the sand which emanated from it was so captivating that in no%0D%0Atime, he had groups of people surrounding him. Eventually, a date was set%0D%0Afor a festival (gathering) wherein he would play his flute. In this%0D%0Afestival, men and women would adorn themselves and display their beauty in%0D%0Afront of one another. It so happened that a male inhabitant of the mountains%0D%0Ajoined in one of these festivals. Upon returning to the mountains, he%0D%0Ainformed his male counterparts of the beauty of the women who inhabit the%0D%0Aland. They descended from the mountains, intermingled with the women, and in%0D%0Ashort space of time adultery became rife on the land. This type of adornment%0D%0Aand display of one's beauty in front of strangers is what Allah has%0D%0Aprohibited women from doing, in this Aayat. (Ibn Katheer vol.4 pg.245)%0D%0A%0D%0AMuqaatil (RA) explained the verse, 'Do not display yourselves' in the%0D%0Afollowing words, 'Displaying the self is when a woman wears her scarf on her%0D%0Ahead, but does not tie the ends, which results in her necklace, earrings and%0D%0Aneck being exposed. This is the displaying which Allah has prohibited women%0D%0Afrom (when they leave their homes through necessity). (Durre Manthoor vol.6%0D%0Apg.602)%0D%0A%0D%0AIbn Aaliyah is reported to have said that 'the former times of ignorance'%0D%0Arefers to the era of Hadhrat Dawood (Alayhis salaam) and Hadhrat Sulaymaan%0D%0A(Alayhis salaam). Women used to wear dresses with long slits on both the%0D%0Asides which resulted in their bodies being exposed. (Tafseer Mazhari vol.9%0D%0Apg.369). In conclusion, this Aayat commands women not to display their%0D%0Abodies or clothes to strangers by secluding themselves in their homes yes,%0D%0Athey may emerge from their homes at time of necessity without adorning%0D%0Athemselves, displaying their beauty (bodies, jewellery, etc.) and covering%0D%0Athemselves in clothing which will not attract the gazes of strangers towards%0D%0Athem. In the remaining portion of this Aayat, Allah Ta'ala commands them to%0D%0Aperform Salaat, give Zakata and obey Allah and His Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) so as to remain cleansed from sins.%0D%0A%0D%0A'Allah and His Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) send 'Salaal' Upon Nabi.%0D%0AO ye who believe, send Salaats and salaam upon the Prophet (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) in abundance.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThe command of Allah Ta'ala given to us in this verse clearly indicates that%0D%0Ait is Waajib (compulsory) for one to send Durood upon the Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) even if it be once in a lifetime.%0D%0A(Tafseer-e-Mazhari vol.9 pg.420). There is no difference of opinion among%0D%0Athe Ulama regarding the compulsion of reciting Durood once in a lifetime.%0D%0AFurthermore, some Ulama are of the opinion that it is Waajib to recite%0D%0ADurood once in every gathering wherein the beloved name of Rasul%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is taken. Thereafter, it will be Mustahabb%0D%0A(preferable) to recite Durood every time his beloved name is taken in that%0D%0Asame gathering. (Qurtubi vol.7 pg.150).%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is reported from Hadhrat Abu Aaliyah (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that the meaning%0D%0Aof Allah sending Salaat upon the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is%0D%0Athe he praises him in front of the angels, and the angels sending salaat%0D%0Aupon the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), is making Du'aa for him.%0D%0A(Durrul Manthur vol.6 pg.646)%0D%0A%0D%0AAccording to Imaam Qurtubi (RA), Durood of Allah is his blessings and%0D%0Apleasure. Durood from the angels is Du'aa and from the Ummah is Du'aa and%0D%0Ahonour. (Qurtubi vol.7 pg.149). Allah mentions at the beginning of the serve%0D%0Aunder discussion that 'he sends Salaat (blessings) upon the Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).' He then commands us to also send Salaat%0D%0A(i.e. make Du'aa unto Him to send his blessings upon the Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Hence, we supplicate by saying, 'O Allah,%0D%0Asend your most choicest blessings and salutations upon the Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). (Bayaanul Qur'aan vol.9 pg.63). Hafiz Ibn%0D%0AKatheer (RA) says that Allah Ta'ala is trying to place the honour and%0D%0Arespect of the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) in our hearts by%0D%0Atelling us that He and His angels send Salaat upon the Prophet (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam). He, then commanded us to send Salaat upon the Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) so as to send Durood (bless and have the%0D%0Ablessed name of his beloved Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) taken) in%0D%0Aboth, the sky and the earth. (Ibn Katheer vol.4 pg.27)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is narrates by Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Abi Layla (Radhiallaahu Anhu). Ka'ab ibn%0D%0AUjrah (Radhiallaahu Anhu) met me and said, 'Shall I not give you a present I%0D%0Agot from the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)? Abdur-Rahmaan said,%0D%0A'Yes, give it to me.' He said, 'We asked Allah's messenger saying, O%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) how should one (ask Allah to) send%0D%0ASalaat upon you and the Ahlul-Bayt (the family members of the Prophet) for%0D%0AAllah has taught us how to send Salaam (greet) you?' He said, 'O Allah send%0D%0Ayour Salaat (mercy) on Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as you sent your%0D%0ASalaat on Ibraahim and the family of Ibraahim, for you are the most%0D%0Apraiseworthy, the most gracious. O Allah send your blessings on Muhammad and%0D%0Athe family of Muhammad as you sent your blessings on Ibraahim and on the%0D%0Afamily of Ibraahim, for you are most praiseworthy, the most gracious.'%0D%0A(Bukhari vol.4 Hadith 589)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
