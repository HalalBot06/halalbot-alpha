  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nafter our death can we meet our beloved ones inshallah in jannat.after my fathers death i saw in my dreams that my dad is telling me not to worry hes absolutely fine in grave and they are taking care of me nicely.after seeing this iam happy and making dua for his happiness in hereafter.i loved my dad somuch .and if i saw in dream what i have to do?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nOne of the bounties of the hereafter is meeting our close and beloved ones on condition they die with Ieman. Allah Taala says, “And We will join their children with them”.\n\nThe above verse is a means of great consolement to believers. Death does not do us apart forever. It is merely a temporary separation for an everlasting union. The temporary separation will make us value the eternal union.\n\nFurthermore, in the course of the separation, both could benefit each other. The living should make dua for the deceased. The best dua is Istighfaar for the deceased. The deceased gets the rewards and also make dua for their living family member.\n\nYou should make dua and Istighfaar for your father. That will elevate his status by Allah. Also do acts of piety. That will be a mean of Sawab Jaariyah (recurring reward) for him.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
