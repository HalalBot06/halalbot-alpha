  "question": "How old was Hazrath Salman Farsi R.A when he accepted Islam. At what age did he pass away .",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMany of the Ulama were unanimous that he lived for 150 years. However, some\nclaim he lived for 350 years. He passed away in the year or 32 or 33 Hijri.\nSome say, the year 36 Hijri.\n\nImaam Ibn Abdul Barr (RA) states that Sayyiduna Salmaan al-Faarsiy took part\nin the battle of Badr. It is also established that he accepted Islam in\nMadinah and not in Makkah. Since the battle of Badr occurred in the second\nyear after Hijrah, the age of Sayyiduna Salman when he accepted Islam can be\nestimated to have been approximately 214 - 218 years according to those who\nsay he lived for 350 years. However, one cannot specify exact dates due to\nthe difference of opinions regarding his age at the time of death.
