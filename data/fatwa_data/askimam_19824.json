  "question": "I was told that if a girl is not getting married, she should have a bath in which Surah Taha was recited. Is this authentic?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was told that if a girl is not getting married and wishes to get married that she should take ghusl with water in which surah Taha has been dissoled and by the will of Allah swt she will get married.  I'm worried to do this as it seems wrong to me to take ghusl in Quran water; although dissolved.  Can you confirm or deny this statement?  Is there any validity to this that you are aware of?  Any reason not to do it?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu `alaykumwa-rahmatullāhiwa-barakātuh.\n\nThe above practice is not proven in the Shariah. Therefore, it will not be permissible to engage in such a practice.\n\nImplore Allah (SubhanahuWaTa’ala) in Du’aa to fulfill all your permissible endeavors and wishes. Du’aa is the most powerful weapon of a Believer.                                                                                         \n\nAnd Allah knows best.\n \nMaulanaIsmail Desai,\nDurban, South Africa\n \nChecked and Approved\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\ndaruliftaa.net"
