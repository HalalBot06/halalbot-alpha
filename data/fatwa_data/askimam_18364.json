Ulama have mentioned that it is wajib (obligatory) to grow the beard at least at fists’ length. The Ulama have deduced this from the following Hadith of the Prophet (SallAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) mentioned in Bukhari:\n\n   عن ابن عمر: عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال خالفوا المشركين وفروا اللحى وأحفوا الشوارب.\n\n(صحيح البخاري، 7/ 73، الفكر)\n\nThe Prophet (SallAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) has mentioned: “Oppose the Polytheists; lengthen the beards and trim the mustaches.”(Bukhari)\n\n \n\nImam Naafi’ (Rahmatullah Alayh) goes on to mention after this Hadith:\n\n \n\nوكان ابن عمر إذا حج أو اعتمر قبض على لحيته فما فضل أخذه.(صحيح البخاري، 7/ 73، الفكر)\n\n  \"And Ibn Umar (RadhAllahu Anhu) during Hajj or Umrah would take hold of his beard with his fist and cut off what was in excess of that.”(Bukhari)\n\n \n\nIn the above mentioned Hadith the Prophet (SallAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) is commanding to grow the beard. Also, there is no indication that this command was intended as a mustahab (preferred) act. Therefore, according to the principles of jurisprudence a command given by the Prophet (SallAllahu Alayhi Wasallam), for which there is no indication of it being mustahab (preferred), will be regarded as being wajib (obligatory).\n\n \n\nFurthermore, the Hadith makes no mention of how long the beard must be. However, Ibn Umar (RadhAllahu Anhu), the narrator of the Hadith, is mentioned to have trimmed the beard up to a fists length. The Prophet (SallAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) or any of his companions have not been reported to have ever shortened the beard less than a fists’ length. Rather, a few of the Sahabah have been reported to have trimmed up to a fists’ length and no more. Thus, the Ulama have concluded that that it is wajib (obligatory) for a Muslim male to keep his beard a fists’ length and no shorter.                \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.)     A person that trims his beard to less than a fistful should not be made the Imam. However, if one does pray behind a person that trims his beard there is no need to repeat the salah for that reason.\n\n \n\n(Fatawa Mahmoodiya, 6/ 121-127, Farooqiyah)\n\n(Fatawa Mahmoodiya, 19, 392-402, Farooqiyah)\n\nولذا يحرم على الرجل قطع لحيته\n(رد المحتار، 6/ 407، سعيد)\n\nولا بأس إذا طالت لحيته أن يأخذ من أطرافها ولا بأس أن يقبض على لحيته فإن زاد على قبضته منها شيء جزه وإن كان ما زاد طويلة تركه كذا في الملتقط والقص سنة فيها وهو أن يقبض الرجل لحيته فإن زاد منها على قبضته قطعه كذا ذكر محمد رحمه الله تعالى في كتاب الآثار عن أبي حنيفة رحمه الله تعالى قال وبه نأخذ كذا في محيط السرخسي ولا يحلق شعر حلقه وعن أبي يوسف رحمه الله تعالى لا بأس بذلك ولا بأس بأخذ الحاجبين وشعر وجهه ما لم يتشبه بالمخنث\n(الفتاوي الهندية، 5/ 438، العلمية)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
