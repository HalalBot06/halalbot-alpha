  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat does ties of kinship mean.  Who are they?  Aunts, uncles, 2nd cousins, sisterinlaws, grnafathers sisters etc?  I am a convert and my relatives dont really get along with me.  Do i still have to keep the ties of kinship with those people.  Jazakallah Khairun\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAlmighty Allah outlines the qualities of the true believers. One of them is that they maintain family ties. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] also emphasized the importance and virtues of maintaining family ties. In one Hadith, Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘That person who wishes that there be barakah and blessing in his sustenance and his life, he should maintain family ties.’ (Muslim)\n\n \n\n \n\nThese are the two aspirations of every person. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] also said, ‘That person who maintains family ties, Allah will keep such a person close to Him and whosoever severs family ties, Allah will sever His relationship from such a person.’ Family ties should be maintained with all family members, close and far. This was also the Sunnah of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. If some family members are not close to you, you should still maintain ties with them. Such an attitude is also an expression of good character and clean heartedness. This is always appreciated by all. This will also be very encouraging to your non-Muslim family members and also a means of da’awah to them. It is important to win the confidence of people and family members. Once the heart becomes fertile, then the seed of da’awah could be planted and Islam will then grow in such a fertile heart.\n\n \n\n \n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
