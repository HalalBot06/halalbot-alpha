  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ndear brother my question is that ive heard that when ur getting ur nikka done the girl is asked if KABOOL three times and she has to say kabool three times well in regards to that question i want to ask that if u are not asked three times to say kabool or you do not say kabool three times is the nikka valid? becasue when my nikka happened i was not asked that and i never said kabool i just said \"jia\" or \"yes\" and thats it. so was the nikka valid or not?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is not necessary to say Qubool three times for the validity of the Nikah. If you said Yes in response to the woman as your wife in the presence of two or more Muslims, the Nikah is valid.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
