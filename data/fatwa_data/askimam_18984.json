  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhen trying to do khatam-e-Quran in taraweeh, is it allowed to say some parts out of order. For example, is it permissible lets say for the imam to skip 5 pages of the middle of juz 17 and then keep reading the rest of the juz 17. And then the next night come back and say those 5 pages of 17th juz and then start on the next juz (18th juz). So I guess what I am asking is if it permissible to not have perfect order when doing completion of Quran in taraweeh. As long as each ayah is recited, does it matter if some parts of the Quran were recited on the wrong day. And if the imam does do this, what should be done? Can it still count as khatam-e-Quran as long as every page is recited by the end of taraweeh?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIt is preferable to recite the Holy Qur’ān in order.1 Thus, after reciting the missed part of the Qur’ān Majīd it will be mustahab (not obligatory) to repeat all those verses that have been recited after the missed part.\n\nHowever, if the Imām had recited many verses, after the missed part of the Qur’ān Karīm and repeating all these verses is difficult then it will be permissible to merely repeat the missed part and continue ahead.2\n\n(Masā’il Ramadān-o-Zakah Mudallal)1\n\n(Bahisti Zewar, Pg.303, Zam Zam)2\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl.
