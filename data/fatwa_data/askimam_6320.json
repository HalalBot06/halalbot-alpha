  "answer": "QUESTION\ni would like to know what is the maximum time after the nikkah can the wallimah be held as i have heard that it is forbidden to kepp it(wallimah) after more then 3 days\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Sunnat time of Walimah is anytime after the consummation of the\nmarriage. What is meant by forbidden after 3 days is to have the Walimah\n'upto 3 days'.\n\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Food on the first day is\nestablished and is Sunnah on the second day and on the third day, it will be\nRiyaa (boasting).' So, to have the Walimah upto 3 days will not be\npermissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
