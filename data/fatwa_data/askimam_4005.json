  "question": "Is it acceptable to perform Ibadat specially on the Night of Meraaj? Did the companions of the Prophet S.A.W.S. do this every year, or is it an innovation in our Deen?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRegarding the actual year of this great event of Me'raaj, there is a\ndifference of opinion among the historians and compilers of Seerah.\n\nIn view of these differences, it is not possible to specify the actual day\nof the miraculous event. The Ahaadith of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)\nshow that through the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhu) who understood Islam\ndirectly from Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the Taabi'een, did not\nannually celebrate the Me'raaj on any particular date. They fully\nappreciated and practically translated the message of this night in their\neveryday lives.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
