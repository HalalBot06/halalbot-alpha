  "question": "Can a man ask a women to remove her scarf, inorder to she what she looks like, when he goes to see her for the prospect of marriage?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf the man is interested but wishes to see the lady without her scarf as he is also interested in how she looks. WIll it be permissable for him ask her to remove it when he visits her?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nIf the boy's choice of marriage is based on seeing the girls hair, he may\nrequest to see her hair.\n\nIn doing so, he should be conscious of the girl's feelings. It is not\npermissible to 'use' the occasion to simply 'enjoy' the beauty of the girl.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
