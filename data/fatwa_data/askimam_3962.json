  "question": "Some people pray Nafl before the Maghrib Salaat. Is this Sunnah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAbdullah ibn Muqaffal (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Perform two Rakaats before Maghrib\nSalaat.' He mentioned this three times and the third time he said,\n'whosoever wishes.' (the narrator said Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) said this) fearing people make the two Rakaats Sunnah.' (Mishkaat\npg.104; Qadeemi)\n\nIn view of the above, the majority of the Fuqahaa besides the Hanafi have\nruled that it is Mustahabb (desirable) to perform two Rakaats before Maghrib\nSalaat. That is not so according to the Hanafi Madhab.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
