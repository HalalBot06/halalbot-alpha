  "question": "Do we really guarantee a place in Heaven by reading so and so dua, or doing sucha and such?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThere are some hadith that state if a person who does such and such will be granted heaven, or will have all his sins forgiven, etc. If these are all correct, wouldnt that make going to Heaven 'too easy'?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt has been narrated on the authority of Hadhrat Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu\nAnhu) that Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has said, 'There is no one\nwhose actions will enter him into Jannah.' He was asked, 'not even you (your\nactions) O Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).' Nabi replied, 'Not\neven I except if Allah encloses me in His mercy.' (Muslim vol.2 pg.577)\n\nIn view of the above, it should be noted that it is only through the Mercy\nof Allah Ta'ala that a person will gain enterance into Jannah. However,\nAllah the Most Merciful has indicated to us the manner to attain His mercy\nand it is through the medium of good actions and relevant Du'aas which will\nbe the means for us to enter Jannah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
