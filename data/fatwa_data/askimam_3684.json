  "question": "Talking to male cousins while being covered and acting in a modest way?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI talk to all my male cousins. I know they are non-mahrem but my parents brought us up to love and care for each other. I wear full hijab in front of them. I am never left alone with them. We all go out including my mahrems to picnics or sight seeing. Is it haram? Will I be punished for taking care of them in the sense I serve food or I ask if they need anything. We also talk about other stuff like our family history, school, up coming events and etc.. My intentions are only to strengthen the family bond. Many say it wrong to communicate with other men than your mahrem. What should I do? Am I doing the right thing now?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, a female must maintain Hijaab from a non-Mahram (not\nprohibited in marriage) males. Your cousins are non-Mahrams to you,\ntherefore, you must observe the laws of Hijaab in front of them. That does\nnot mean that you cannot maintain family ties with them. You should\ncertainly do so without violating the Shari'ah laws of Hijaab.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
