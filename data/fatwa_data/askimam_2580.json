  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamo aliakum MuftisaabHere is an example; Two men came to our beloved phrophet {saw} and asked a question,\"Is it permissible for a man to kiss his wife whilst fasting? To one man he the phrophet{saw} replied yes and to the other he replied no This was bcoz one was old and the other man was young. hence muftisaab please explain how you can give fatwas online without really knowing the mentality(aqeedah), environment, nature of the person asking?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nTaking into consideration conditions and circumstances is indeed an integral part of issuing Fatwas. However, that can be communicated through writing as well.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
