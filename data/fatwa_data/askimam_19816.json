  "question": "I have enough resources to go for Hajj. My wife is pregnant and my father wants me to do Hajj next year. Is Hajj obligatory on me?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am the only son of my parents and we are living in UAE. My question is at the moment my wife and me have enough resources (gold cash) to go for hajj this year. We have two kids age 1 & 2. My wife is pregnant and the expected date of delivery is 5 Sept. 2012. I want to know what will be the obligations of Hajj on us with these circumstances whereas my father is insisting me to save some money for buying the house in home country and do hajj next year. Please advise. JazakAllah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. \n\nAs-salāmu `alaykumwa-rahmatullāhiwa-barakātuh.\n\nIn principle, if one has sufficient means over and above one’s needs and requirements to fulfill the needs of one’s family to perform Hajj, it becomes obligatory on one to perform Hajj immediately.[1]\n\nIt is obligatory on you and your wife to perform Hajj this year if you and your wife have sufficient means to perform Hajj. \n\nIf your wife becomes ill and cannot manage to perform Hajj, it will be permissible for her to delay the performance of Hajj.[2]\n\nYou state that your father is insisting that you save money to buy a new house and perform Hajj next year. \n\nKindly consider the following options:\n\nYour wife is ill; therefore she is not obligated to go for Hajj this year. She may perform Hajj next year. In that case, she will have to be accompanied by her Mahram. \n\nYou may use the same money that your wife could use to perform Hajj to buy a new house e.t.c.\n\nYou are not excused from performing Hajj; therefore you will be obligated to proceed for the performance of Hajj. \n\nIf you do not perform Hajj, we advise you to record the following in your will that “If I pass away and did not perform Hajj, then I appoint so and so to perform Hajj – E- Badal on my behalf”.\n\nYou will have to proceed to perform Hajj the following year if you did not perform Hajj. \n\nAnd Allah knows best.\n\nMawlana Ismail Desai\nDurban, South Africa\nStudent DarulIftaa\n\nChecked and Approved \nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n\n\n\n\n1 فرض مرة علي الفور( تنوير الابصار و جامع البحار، ج 3، ص 455- 456، ايج ايم سعيد)\n\nيفترض في العمر مرة و يوجبه مضيقا لا موسعا علي كل مسلم حرعاقل بالغ قادر علي الزاد و الراحلة و نفقة الذهاب و الاياد و الاياب فاضلا عن حوائجه الاصلية و نفقة عيالها الي حين عوده مع امن الطريق(مجمع البحرين، كتاب الحج، ص 217، العلمية)\n\nفرض مرة علي الفور في الاصح( امداد الفتاح، كتاب الحج، ص 687)\n\n[2]  و التاخير بعذر جائز( المحيط البرهاني، ج 3، ص 395، ادارة)"
