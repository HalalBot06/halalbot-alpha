  "question": "Hajj on Borrowing money",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nASWK again jazakallah khair for the prompt clarification on Qst-3855, one more solution needed. Can I send my aged parents for hajj pilgreamage on borrowing money(without interest on the money) from others & later on those borrowings would be repaid back by me through my regular earnings, no other loans would be pending other than this borrowing. Creditors would be giving the permission to carryon the hajj program. Would this hajj would be valid. Cos due to agedness we could not guarantee that my parents live for next year?s or next to next year?s hajj, only allah(swt) guarantee of their living. I want my parents & myself ?s hajj to be completed within this year, insha allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for you to send your parents for Hajj with the borrowed\nmoney on condition arrangements are made with the creditors as well.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
