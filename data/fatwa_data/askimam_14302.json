  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nsome religious scholars said that zakat cannot be given to people who have T.V. /V.C.R/DVD in their homes because these make a person not eligible for zakat, now a days everybody has one or all of these things in their homes but not all of them are welloff and they are quite eligible for taking zakat , please give detail reply in  this regard\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. A poor person claiming to accept Zakaat and has any un-Islamic item, for example, television, etc. in his possession should be analyzed in the following:\n\n• If the poor persons need is lesser than the value of the television, Zakaat should not be given to him. He/she should be advised to sell the television and fulfill the need. However, if the need exceeds the value of the television, Zakaat may be given to him/her less the value of the television.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
