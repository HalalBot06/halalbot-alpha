  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a married woman and i am working in US and I have recently started to wear Hijaab and my husband wants me to work because he is always in doubt about his job and I am working as a customer service representative and I just have to receive the emails and send them reply and I also have to talk the customer over the phone about products information , is it halaal to work here or not ...\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari?ah, a woman should remain in the confines of her home. She may leave her home only with a reason acceptable in Shari?ah, and with Hijaab. That is covering her entire body so that the form and shape of her body is concealed. She also cannot apply fragrance when she comes out of her home.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe do not know what you mean by your husband being in doubt regarding his employment. If he is uncertain of retaining his employment, then he should search for another employment. If there is a fear of him losing his employment in the near future and an alternate employment is not available, then you may continue your employment if your husband does not have sufficient surplus funds to maintain the household.%0D%0A%0D%0AOnce your husband finds a suitable employment that is sufficient to fulfil the basic and immediate needs of the household, then you should discontinue with your employment and return to your natural abode, your home.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
