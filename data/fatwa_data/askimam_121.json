  "question": "We are in USA, so can we eat the meat and chickens even we don't know how they are killed?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSecond question: Hukm al-qasar fi al-salah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ1) Shari'ah has emphasised on consumption of pure and Halaal foods and to\nabstain from anything doubtful. If one does not know whether the chicken and\nmeat is Halaal or not, it is not permissible to eat them.\n\nQ2) A person becomes a Musaafir if he undertakes to travel a distance of 88 kms.\nor more. A Musaafir will make Qasr (perform two Rakaats instead of 4 Rakaats\nin Dhuhr, Asr and Esha). It is not necessary to perform Sunnat Salaat during\nSafar. However, if time permits, it is desirable to perform the Sunnats as\nwell. Witr Salaat after Esha is compulsory even during Safar.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
