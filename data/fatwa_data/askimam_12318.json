  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs the renowned Indian Sufi Nizamuddin Aulia considered a Muslim? What about his current followers? Is visiting his mausoleum correct?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe renowned Sufi Nizamuddeen Aulia is a special Muslim. He is one from amongst the close servants of Allah. It is because of his teachings and sacrifices that thousands of people became Muslims and the common Muslims became righteous. Those people who practice on his teachings are correct .Whatever activities occur by his grave in today's times are not from amongst his teachings and he never commanded that such activities should take place. %0D%0A%0D%0AWhoever makes Tawaaf of his grave, prostrates to his grave and celebrate ?Urs (death ceremony) are not his true followers. In fact these people are opposing his teachings, because in today's time there are a lot of innovations and impermissible activities taking place by his grave. It is for this reason that visiting the grave is not correct .One should rather read something for Esaale Thawaab (sending blessings) in his place and make this Du?aa: ?Oh Allah, accomplish my task through his medium.? This will be permissible.
