  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n(1)Can A Muslim Man Have a sex with a girl before marriage to show her that he love her.If NO can He Kiss her.And If no can he talk to her about the marriage and can he say that I LOVE YOU.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nEvery form of pre-marital contact with ones future spouse is haraam. It is not even permissible to talk with a person of the opposite gender if the person is not a mahram, for example, father, mother, brother, sister etc. These are such people with whom marriage is permanently prohibited (mahram).\n\nTo have any contact with any other person of the opposite gender besides a mahram opens the door for evil and immoral relationship. Shariah prohibited zina and everything that leads to zina. That includes kissing, talking, directly and indirectly through the telephone and other forms of modern communication, sms texts and computer chatrooms.\n\nIt should also be pointed out that many girls have become victims of abuse under the false pretext of love and marriage. Men hungry for fulfilling their desires offer superficial love to woman and after ‘using’ them literally dump them.\n\nIn the shariah approach of all doors closed until marriage is a safeguard for abuse of women.\n\nIf one claims to love a woman, prove in within the context of marriage and commitment.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalam\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
