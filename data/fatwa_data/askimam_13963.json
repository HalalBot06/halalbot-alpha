  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nwould like to have your say about one of the issue which I face while offering the prayers\n\nAs you know, according to some school of thoughts \"Rafa Yadain\" is compulsory while offering SALAH. However, as per the interpretation of Hanfi school of thought, the approach is some how different from others like \"Imam Shafaee\" & Imam Maalik\n\nIt would be very kind of you if a detailed clarification could be given about the above mentioned issue as to what method should be adopted that is also best supported by Sunnah / Hadith.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe issue of Raf-ul yadayn is not of permissibility and non-permissibiliy. It is an issue of Afzaliyyah (more virtuous).\n\nOne Hadith states: Ibn Mas’ood [radhiallaahu anhu] says, ‘I shall show you how Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] performed Salaat and he only made Raf-ul yadayn in the beginning of Salaat.’ (Sunan al-Tirmidhi Hadith257)\n\nBased on this, Imaam Abu Hanifa and Imaam Maalik [ra] preferred this view that one should only raise his hands in the beginning of Salaat at the Takbeer Tahrima. (Naylul Awtaar vol.2 pg.185; Ilmiyah)\n\nAnother Hadith states: Ibn Umar [radhiallaahu anhu] mentions that Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] used to raise his hands when he commenced Salaat, at the time of going into Ruku and when he came up from Ruku. (Bukhari).\n\nBased on this Hadith, Imaam al-Shaafi’ee and Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal [ra] preferred Raf-ul- yadayn in other postures as well.\n\nHowever, all the Imaams consider both views – to life the hands in all postures or only in the beginning as permissible. According to Imaam Abu Hanifa and Imaam Maalik, it is also permissible to lift the hands in all postures. According to Imaam al-Shaafi’ee and Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, it is not compulsory to lift the hands in all postures.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
