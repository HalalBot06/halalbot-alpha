  "question": "Concerning the fabricated hadiths of Fadhaail-e-Aamaal",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nConcerning the fabricated hadiths of  Fadhaail-e-Aamaal\n\n \n\nIn Fatwa #  3005, you mention that “There are no fabricated Ahaadith in Fadhaail-e-Aamaal of Hadhrat Shaykh Zakariyya (RA). Hadhrat Shaykh was an authority in Hadith.” But in Fatwa # 13128, you mention, “There are a few fabricated Ahaadith, but the author has pointed these out.”\n\nI’m not trying to take anything out of context, but I am very confused and desperate to know whether there are any fabricated hadiths, and if so, which ones? Because I read the book everyday but, I haven’t found where it mentions that certain hadiths are authentic and certain aren’t. On top of that, I mention a lot of these hadiths to other people, and now am scared if I might have said a fabricated one.  I’d really like it if you could explain to me which ones are considered fabricated, and if so, why they are still published in the book? Are fabricated hadiths, (regardless of why they were created) haram?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe word ‘fabricated’ in 13128 refers to weak Ahaadith and not Mawdhoo Ahaadith. Weak Ahaadith are accepted in Fadhaail (virtues). Fadhaail-e-Aamaal is a compilation that encourages and motivates actions through virtues.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
