  "question": "Please let me know if this is true? use an alcoholic perfume spray from some distance",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI heard a relative of mine saying that if you use an alcoholic perfume spray from some distance for example 10 centimeters, it is permissible for you to pray with the same clothes & even you can pray in the Masjid. He says that he has confirmed this with an imam also. What my belief is any perfume which includes alcohol is haraam to use on your body or your clothes, as alcohol is haraam. So please advice in this matter. JazaakAllahKhair. Also, I would like to know the exact translation of ?And ALLAH knows the best? in Arabic.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe use of the spray that contains alcohol (denatured) is permissible and does not make the clothes najas (impure), hence, one can make Salaah. The type of alcohol that is used in the spray is not that is used in the beverages and the like.\n\nThe translation of Allah knows best which would be transliterated as \"Allah hu A'lam\".\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nShaykh Irshaad Amod\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Imraan Vawda"
