  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni want to know about the Sharae ruling on the \"Govt. of a Women\", can women take part in elections?, can women has right of casting vote? can women be the President, Prime Minister aur simply Minister of an Islamic State? please mention the Qurani Ayaat and Ahadees if available in this regard.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah is the Creator of the entire universe. He is perfect and created everything perfectly. Each and every creation has its specific role to play in the functioning of the universe. The sun rises at dawn, sheds brightness on the earth and sets at dusk. The stars come out at night, assists the wayfarers and sets before dawn. Similarly, the human anatomy, the legs are used used to walk and the hands to grasp, etc. The universe runs smoothly by each creation functioning in the way it was created for. Pandemonium will set in the moment an item does not function in its proper manner. If the sun does not rise, the entire earth will not function properly.\n\nHuman beings were also created for specific functions. Each one lending support to the other in its own way thereby assisting in the smooth functioning of the universe. The kingdom of a woman is her home. Her dominion reins over her children. The smooth running of the home depends on the woman. She is incharge of the domestic duties of the house. The moment she steps out of the house and ventures into the world, she will be lacking in her responsibilities, thereby corrupting the smooth running of the divine system of Allah. Therefore, every person should conduct him/herself in the manner he/she was created for.\n\nAllah has bestowed man the capability to rule, become prime minister/president or simply speaking a leader of any community. Allah mentions, ‘Men are overseers over women.’ (Nisaa 34). Men are meant to go out into the world and seek a living, unlike women who are embodiments of concealment. They are not meant to go out into the world and become public figures. It is in the home where the honour, respect and dignity of women lie. Today, pandemonium has broken out because women have emerged from their homes. Women are being treated as advertisement tools. They are being used disgracefully to market even the pettiest item. Therefore, women are urged to return to their abodes, fulfil their respective natural responsibilities and abandon their unnatural ambitions. This will restore the smooth functioning of the universe.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
