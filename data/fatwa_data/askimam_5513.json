  "answer": "QUESTION\nImam Sahib, I am a 26 year old muslim girl and would like to know some ahadith according to which eating or drinking with the left hand is forbidden and how can i try to change the habit now that all these years have passed and find it very difficult to use my right hand for this purpose. May Allah reward you for helping Muslims all over the world.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) Salamah bin Akwa' radiyaalahu anhu reports that once a person was eating%0D%0Awith his left hand in the presence of Nabi alaihis salaam, so Nabi alaihis%0D%0Asalaam said to him: 'Eat wiht your right hand\". He replied: 'I am unable to%0D%0Ado so'. Nothing prevented him except pride from eating with his right hand.%0D%0AThereafter, he was never able to lift his right hand to his mouth. (It%0D%0Abecame paralysed due to not obeying Nabi alaihis salaam). Refer to Riyadus%0D%0ASaaliheen pg. 333, Saleem Book Depot.%0D%0A%0D%0A2) The first effort you should begin with is to try as much as possible to%0D%0Aeat with your right hand even it means that you eat only a few morsels with%0D%0Ayour right hand and thereafter you continue with your left hand. The second%0D%0Aeffort is to ask Allah Ta'ala to grant you the strength and ability to eat%0D%0Aaccording to the Sunnat and only to please Him. Thirdly, is that while you%0D%0Aare eating, try to encourage others with you to eat with the right hand.%0D%0A%0D%0AInsha Allah, if you are true and sincere for your love for the Sunnat then%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala will definitely endow with the power of practising on the%0D%0Acomplete sunnat. Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
