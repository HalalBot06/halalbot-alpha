  "question": "what is the meaning of seeing part of your house collapse after a night of very harsh winds",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalamualykum, I recall having a dream were I witnessed the extension part of my house had been brought down and was in total ruins after I believe to be a night of very strong winds. Also I dreamt that I was in a Pub and I was drinking there, I could see myself drinking alcohol, I knew it was wrong watching myself doing this bad thing but in the dream I was drinking it even though it had the most disgusting taste. I was very disturbed having remembered seeing this after I had woke up. Is this bad? Walaykumasalam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta?ala sent us in this world to test us. For that, there will be adverse conditions in which we should turn our gaze to Allah and beseech His assistance through patience and Salaat.\n\nTo turn to Allah with pains in the heart is a test but invokes the mercy of Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
