  "question": "How do I control my gaze (e.g looking at females) when I am at university?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI find this very difficult to do as I am not married and cannot find a suitable wife at the moment. Please reccommend me something which is easy for me to do. Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has advised the youth saying, 'O young\npeople. Those of you who have the ability to get married should do so for\nverily in it (marriage) is the lowering of your gaze and the chastity of\nyour private parts. And he who does not have the ability (of marriage)\nshould hold on to fasting for verily in fasting there is the constrainment\nof one's desires.' (Mishkaat)\n\nIn the event if one falls into a predicament then he should lower his gaze\nwith this in mind that the one on whom lustful gazes is intended to be\npassed on will turn into dust and will be food for the worms in the grave.\nIn addition to this, one should not forget about the Omnipresence of Allah\nTa'ala.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
