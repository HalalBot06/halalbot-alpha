  "question": "Mufti Saab please tell me what can I do. I have been talking to a girl who I will marry, for a year and some months. Is talking to her haraam? and would it break my fast?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) I love a girl a lot and I always feel like talking to her. I'm not sure if she loves me or not. Is talking to her Haram? I was told by a Mufti in Leicester it is permissible to talk to a girl that u know u will marry. I've talked to the girl if we can get married and she agreed, but only after some years.  So what can I do Mufti Saab?\n \n2) Also I was told talking to her while fasting breaks my Fast?  I asked Local Maulana who is from India if my Fast Breaks when I talk to this girl and he said my fast doesnt break. Mufti saab please explain this Masala. Note that I love her. but our parents don’t know anything. Neither me and her ever meet. We just talk on the phone.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\n1) It is absolutely forbidden (haram) for a person to unnecessarily interact with a non mahram (a non mahram is that woman with whom marriage is permissible)..\n\nShariah has closed all the doors that may lead one to commit illicit sins.\n\nThis is why Allah the almighty states in the quran: \"And do not even come close to fornication!\" (Israa'/ verse: 32)\n\nWhy are you living in delusion? You are not sure whether the girl in question loves you or not! The best thing would be to inform your parents about the situation and to send a proposal for marriage. If the girl accepts, you will be happy and if she says no, then at least you know where you stand.\n\nYou should repent to Allah for all the times you have unlawfully spoken to the girl and make a firm intention to never commit this sin again.\n\n2) Indulging in haram whilst fasting deprives one from attaining maximum benefit from the month of Ramadhan and causes ones spirituality level to plummet. However, talking with a non mahram does not invalidate ones fast.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
