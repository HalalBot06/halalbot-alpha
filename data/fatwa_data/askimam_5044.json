  "question": "When a masbuq joins Salah in four Rakah and stands up after the Imam says 'salaam', does he say the takbeer before recitation of Surah Fatiha (of 1st Rakah)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalmu-alaykum respected mufti sahab, Why does the masbuq have to sit in tashahud in this first rakah he is completing.? shouldnt it be in the second rakah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Masbooq should recite one Takbeer whilst rising from the sitting to the\nQiyaam position. Thereafter, he must recite the Thanaa, Ta'awwuz, Tasmiyah,\netc. There is no need to recite a new Takbeer whilst standing.\n\nIn order for us to answer the second part of your question, we need more\nclarification. We need to know whether your question is regarding a Masbooq\nin a two, three or four Rakaat Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
