  "question": "Is it allowed to take an automobile through an automatic car washing machine? soap used probably is made from prohibited animals",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it allowed to take an automobile through an automatic car washing machine? I ask because the soap used probably is made from prohibited animals and sometimes I wipe the excess leftover soapsuds from the windows and it may touch my hand. Sometimes while I watch the machines washing my car, these soap bubbles fly through the air and land on my head. I am worried by this. Is it wrong to pay money for such vanity as a clean vehicle?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible to have one?s motor vehicle washed through an automatic car washing machine. The jurists have permitted the use of soaps containing animal fat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
