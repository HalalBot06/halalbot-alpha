  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nmy question is, in prayer when you prostate and then sit up, do we recite anything like 'allahumma magfirili war hamni' before going in to the second prostration and then before gettin up for the second rakat do we sit recite that and then get up?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nOne may recite the dua “Allahummagh fir li war hamni” “Oh Allah, forgive and have mercy on me” between the two sajdas (prostrations).\n\nThe dua should not be read after the second sajda before standing up for the next rakat.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
