  "question": "Does the bloody discharge also count as a period not to pray Salat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am 47 years old married woman, mother of four children. I have always had a regular menstrual cycle, but for the last three months I have a problem. I am in pre-menopausal stage and have fibroids, according to my doctor. I used to have 7 days menstruation, but now I have 8 days of slight bleeding discharge (thick without flow), which in my opinion is not really the menstrual cycle. Then I have 8-10 days of very heavy bleeding. Together it is usually 17-18 days of bloody discharge and heavy bleeding together. When should I count my cycle so I can pray Salat properly? I know that a normal period should be between minimum 3 days and maximum 10 days. Should I count from the beginning when I first see the blood, or the second time when I have very heavy bleeding? Does the bloody discharge also count as a period not to pray Salat? I cannot compare to previous cycles because they vary time to time (sometimes I have 4 weeks without any bleeding, sometimes I have only 10 days without any bleeding).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe moment you start discharging any colour except white or transparent, your period (i.e. Haydh) starts and not when you start bleeding profusely.\n\nSince you bleed more than ten days, you should consider the first ten as Haydh (normal period) and the remaining 7 ? 8 days as Istihaadhah. In this period of Istihaadha, you should perform Salaat, you may engage in intercourse, etc. as you would in your clean period.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
