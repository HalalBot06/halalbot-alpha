  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am married to a girl who has family members who are not Muslim including her parents. Although my wife has converted to be Muslim and she?s a strong believer, she wants to attend these funerals because it?s her family. I know she will not be participating in the ceremony that will be going on, but I don?t want her to attend these funerals because of the religious ceremonies. I also don?t want to stop her or make her feel like I don?t care. I don?t want to argue with her, but I can?t help the feel\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible in Islam to visit one?s Kaafir relatives and to console them. However, it is not permissible to take part in their religious ceremonies.\n\nGo with her to her family?s home and together console them and deal kindly with them. Explain kindly to her that it is prohibited to take part in the funeral ceremony. However, consoling and visiting is permissible.
