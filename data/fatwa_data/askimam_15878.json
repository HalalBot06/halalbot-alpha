Firstly, you should try to observe if you qualify to be a ma’zoor or not. I.e. if the fluid flows out continuously for one full time of salaah (its easier to observe at Maghrib time, as it is the shortest time), and the flowing does not stop for  the amount of time in which you could make wudhu and perform the fardh salaah, then you will be regarded as a ma,zur. Once you become a ma’zur, you don’t have to make the abovementioned observation for all times of salaah, but you will remain a ma’zur until the discharge of fluid stops completely, and not a drop is discharged for one full time of salaah.\n\nWhen you have confirmed that you are a ma’zur, you will be required to make wudhu only once for every time of salaah. Once you have made wudhu for a particular salaah, you will also be able to perform all sunan and nawafil with the same wudhu. Similarly, the recitation of the Quran and all those a’mal that require wudhu could be performed with the same wudhu. The discharge of liquid during this time of salaah will not break the wudhu, nor will it be necessary to clean the impurity. The wudhu will only break once the time of salaah has expired. For example, if you make wudhu after the time of Zuhr has set in, then your wudhu will only break on the expiry of the time of Zuhr. However, if any other act that nullifies wudhu (e.g. passing of wind, etc.) takes place, then the wudhu will break as normal, for you will not be regarded ma’zur in that act.\n\nOn the other hand, if you do not qualify to be a ma’zur, then you don’t have any option but to make wudhu every time the fluid is discharged. Similarly, this fluid will be regarded as impure, the cleaning of the impurity will be necessary for the validity of salaah. To avoid too much inconvenience, you could perform Zuhr salaah towards the end of the time of Zuhr and Asr salaah as soon as the time of Asr enters. You could do the same with Maghrib and Isha. This may save you from using the washroom too frequently.\n\nوصاحب عذر من به سلس بول لا يمكنه إمساكه أو استطلاق بطن أو انفلات ريح أو استحاضة .....إن استوعب عذره تمام وقت صلاة مفروضة بأن لا يجد في جميع وقتها زمنا يتوضأ ويصلي فيه خاليا عن الحدث. وهذا شرط العذر في حق الابتداء ، وفي حق البقاء كفى وجوده في جزء من الوقت ولو مرة وفي حق الزوال يشترط استيعاب الانقطاع تمام الوقت. وحكمه الوضوء لكل فرض ثم يصلي فيه فرضا ونفلا  فإذا خرج الوقت بطل\n\nRaddul Muhtar Vol.1 Pg.305 (H.M. Sa’eed Company)\n\nوتتوضأ المستحاضة ومن به عذر كسلس بول أو استطلاق بطن لوقت كل فرض ويصلون به ويبطل وضوء المعذورين بخروج الوقت فقط ولا يصير معذورا حتى يستوعبه العذر وقتا كاملا ليس فيه انقطاع بقدر الوضوء والصلاة وهذا شرط ثبوته وشرط دوامه وجوده في كل وقت بعد ذلك ولو مرة وشرط انقطاعه وخروج صاحبه عن كونه معذورا خلو وقت كامل عنه\n\nHashiyat-u-Tahtawi ‘ala Maraqil Falah Pg.148 (Darul Kutub Al miyyah)\nFatawa Mahmodiyah Vol.5 Pg.224/5 (Jami’ah Farooqiyah)\nFatawa Uthmani Vol.1 Pg.365 (Maktabah Ma’ariful Quran)\n\n2. Menstrual periods are something natural and destined by Allah Ta’ala. Shariah understands this and permits women to avoid fasting on these days and does on levy any penalty on it. Moreover, women who have used such pills complain about confusion in their menstrual cycles making it difficult in performing salaah, etc. Therefore, there is no necessity for taking tablets to delay/stop the menstrual cycle and it is advisable not to take them. However, if one takes pills to delay the menses in order t fast, the fast will be valid.\n\nFatawa Raheemiyah Vol.8 Pg.136 (Darul Isha’at)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
