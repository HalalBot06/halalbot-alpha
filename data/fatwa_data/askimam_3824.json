  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn order to become an Islamic scholar you need to enrol into a reputable\ninstitute of higher learning. You must also spend time with other Islamic\nscholars in order to increase your knowledge and to learn about contemporary\nissues and witness how the shariah is interpreted and brought to life. As\nfor attaining Jannah that is the goal of each and every one of us, Inshallah\ni.e. we all need to follow the Shariah to its fullest.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
