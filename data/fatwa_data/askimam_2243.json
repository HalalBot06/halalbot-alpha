  "question": "You stated that it was permissable to consume a nourishment drink that contains 15% alcohol.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThis is not medication which is neccessary to preserve life, so why is such an act permissable as ethanol is pure Alcohol (kamr) and is the same Kamr found in Vodka/Rum/Spirits etc?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPrincipally, if the alcohol is extracted from grapes or dates it is not\npermissible. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, 'Khamr (wine) is\nfrom these two trees, dates and grapes.' (Mishkãt p. 317).\n\nFurthermore, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, 'Alcohol itself\nis prohibited and intoxication in every other beverage.' (Hidaaya vol. 4 p.\n497).\n\nIn view of the abovementioned Hadith, since the alcohol in coke is from\nethanol which is fermented from sugar cane mollasses and does not\nintoxicate, it is permissible. However, if one is doubtful, he may exercise\nprecaution and abstain.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
