  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari?ah, you are an adult and you have an independent right to choose your marriage partner. However, it is important for you to understand that a decision of marriage is a major one with major implications. Such a decision requires insight and wisdom and which one attains only through experiences of life.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou are 22 and did not experience much of life as your parents. They have the experiences of life and built up insight and wisdom. Your parents have love for you and you should strongly consider their advice and guidance. Nevertheless, after all said and done, if you are still inclined towards that boy and there is embarassment caused to your family in you marrying the boy, based on the laws of Kufu (compatibility in Shari?ah), then your marriage to the boy will not be valid. We advise you discuss the issue with some senior members of your family to intercede to your parents if necessary on your behalf.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe discourage you from making a decision by yourself.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
