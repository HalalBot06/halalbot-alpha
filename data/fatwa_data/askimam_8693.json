  "question": "Is dating allowed in Islam? Can one have a girlfriend or boyfriend?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Haraam (strictly prohibited) for a boy to have a girlfriend and for a girl to have a boyfriend.\n\nAny type of contact including dating between a Ghayr Mahram (not prohibited in marriage) male and female without a valid Shar?ee excuse falls in the category of Zina (adultery) which is a major sin and incurs the wrath and anger of Allah Ta?ala upon the individual.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
