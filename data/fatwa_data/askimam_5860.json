  "question": "1.A widower had four daughters and two sons. All the daughters married and have male female childs. Two of the daughters died. Widower has one house. What will be the division of inheritance.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, it must be pointed out that the heirs of an Estate may only\nbe determined upon one's demise.\n\nAccording to the Islamic Law of Succession and Inheritance, distribution of\nan Estate will only commence after funeral expenses, debts and bequests (if\nany) made to non-heirs - which will not exceed one-third (1/3) of the Estate\nafter debts and funeral expenses - have been settled. Thereafter, all assets\nform part of the Net Estate and will have to be distributed according to the\nIslamic Law of Succession and Inheritance.\n\nIn order for us for us to issue a ruling, kindly explain whether the\ndaughters predeceased the father or not. Also, specify the exact number and\ngender of the deceased's daughter's children.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
