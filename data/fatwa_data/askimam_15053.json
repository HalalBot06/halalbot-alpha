  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nsalaam mufti saab ,\n\n(1) I am facing a difficult situation in my life ,My wife is an aalima and she is facing some disturbances from jinns , she feel so. Sometimes she feels fragrance of loban and perfume around her and after that she feels uneasiness and weakness in whole body, before marriage also this type of small problem was happened to her.now we have 2 children and it looks like they r getting frightened in the nights,and my wife is taking taawiz water and burning of taawiz and recitation of ayaatul qursi etc remedies for more than a month , but there seems to be very little improvements, now what i want to know is can this type of fragrance cause any damage to her and our kids ? if we discontinue all treatment and let this problem continue , will it be harmful to us ?can you pls suggest some kind of symptoms from which we can know that now there is no effect of jinn ? we changed an aamil as there was not much benefit from his taawiz,the second aamil gave some taawiz and a bit similar tratments.please note that ,I personally never felt these fragrences even though she claimed that she was feeling it.\n\n(2) mufti saab , can you pls tell me whether it is allowed to listen cricket commentary in a running car where other passengers are not interested to listen to it ?generally we listen some quran or bayaans but ever since this worldcup started , we had a dispute about this and one of us even told that it is haraam to listen cricket commentary,  pls clarify.\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nYou may consider consulting an appropriate physician due to her mental condition. Many people have similar experiences and have been medically treated.\nIt is not permissible to listen to cricket commentary. If the driver does not consider the request of the passengers, then look for an alternative vehicle or else make Sabr.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
