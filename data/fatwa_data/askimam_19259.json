  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am working with an American Title Insurance and Mortgage company in as a process trainer. I had been working in this industry from past 6 years and performed various tasks relating to the preparation of reports pertaining to the sale and refinance of the property that in turn helps the title company to issue insurance policy to buyer and lender.\n\nComing to the main question, I always had financial problems even after earning a good sum, I don’t understand why I have been losing all my saving in some or other way. However I try, I am not able save anything till now.\n\nI have also invested in stock market and Islamic forex trading and I never earned anything and lost a good share of my savings.\n\nCould you please help and make me understand whether I am in a wrong profession and due to this it’s affecting me financially and in other ways as Allah doesn’t like me to work in this industry.\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nConventional Insurance Schemes are not permissible. There are three components (interest, gambling and uncertainty) in such schemes due to which conventional insurance schemes are decreed impermissible.\n\nAs a process trainer in your company, your role is to issue a report which will assist the company to approve or disapprove the insurance. As such your role is assisting in sin.\n\nAllah Ta’ala says,\n\nوَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ\n\nAnd do not assist in sin\n\n(Qur’an 5:2)\n\nIf you do have an alternate Shariah Compliant employment, you should terminate this employment, even if you have to make some monetary sacrifice and adjustments in your life. Halal income yields barakah. That will bring piece and contentment in your life.\n\nIf you do not have an alternate halal source of income, continue your employment with the mortgage company and also make Istighfār and dua to Allah for a halal source of income. Recite the following dua as much as you can especially after Fardh Salah.\n\nاللَّهُمَّ اكْفِنِي بحلالك عَن حرامك\nوأغنني بِفَضْلِك عَمَّن سواك\n\nTransliteration: “Allahumma ikfini bihalaalika an haraamika wa-aghnini bifadhlika amman siwaak”\n\nTranslation:”Oh Allah, suffice me with that which is Halaal from that which is Haraam and through your virtue make me independent from anyone besides you”.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\n \n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
