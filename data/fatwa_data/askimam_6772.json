  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am referring to Part 2 of question No. 6712 i.e. Is it necessary to read iqamat in the mosque for ada and qaza salats when I perform myself (not with jamath). And your fatwa is. It is Makrooh (disliked) to omit the Iqaamat when performing Salaat individually. (Ibid pg.394). I think you wanted to write ?to not omit? instead of ?to omit?. May be you wrote it by misunderstanding. Please clarify.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe have reviewed our answer.\n\nIt is Makrooh to omit (leave out) the Iqaamat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
