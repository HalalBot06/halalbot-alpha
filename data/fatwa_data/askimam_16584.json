  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1.a widow woman is allowed to remarry in islam.what the shariyah says about it?\n\n2.a young widow is left with her small kids and in laws.now the inlaws dont want her to remarry because she has to look after her kids.is this allowed in islam,or what shariyah has to say about such a matter?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is permissible for a widow to remarry after her iddat period of four months and ten days if she is not conceived or till birth if she is conceived. There are many examples in the life of Sahabiyyat widows who remarried after their iddat. Umme Salma (RA) married Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) after the demise of her husband Abu Salma and after her Iddat, she had a son Umar from Abu Salma (RA). However, great virtue is mentioned in the hadith for a widow who does not marry in order to raise her children. Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said, “I and such a woman will be like this (Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) joined the forefinger and the middle finger) in Jannah”.\n\nIf a widow has the courage not to remarry, then she will bear the virtues of this hadith. If she does not have the courage to and wishes to remarry, then she is at liberty to marry. No one should stop her from exercising her Shari right. If anyone does that, that will be an infringement on her Shari right and is a sin.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
