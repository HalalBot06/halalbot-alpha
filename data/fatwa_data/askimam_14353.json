  "question": "Is it permissible to offer prayers in Imam-Bara (shia mosque) during traveling?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissible to offer prayers in Imam-Bara (shia mosque) during traveling?\n\nOne of my colleagues was out of country on a business trip. It was time of Maghrib when he left his office; he searched for mosque but unfortunately there wasn’t any Masjid nearby. There was only an Imam-Bara in that area. He’d two choices:\n\n- either delay the Maghrib Salat (Qadha)\n\n- or offer Maghrib in Shia-mosque\n\nHe opted 2nd option and offered maghrib prayer in shia-mosque. I’ve two questions:\n\n- Does he need to repeat his prayer?\n\n- What should one do in such situations next time?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nRasulullah () said \"Allah has made the entire earth a Musjid for me\". This is the specialty of this Ummah that we may pray where ever possible. Previous nations had to pray in designated areas and were not allowed to pray anywhere. Performing Salaah in a Shia or imam Bara does not affect the validity of the Salaah. The Salaah performed was valid and there is no need to repeat the Salaah. To delay the Salaah without a valid reason is a sin. If you are faced in a similar situation some other time, you should perform your Salaah wherever.\n\nIt is important to note that the above ruling was if you had performed your Salaah individually. However, if you had followed an imam, and his Aqeeda (belief) is not according to the beliefs of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaa’ah, it is not be permissible to follow that imam.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai\n\nChecked and Approved\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
