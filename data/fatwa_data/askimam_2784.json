  "question": "I am very lazy and I perform wudu only by washing each part once? Is my wudu walid?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI know it is Sunna to wash three times each part (i.e. hands, face and feet). But it is also permissible, infact sunna to do it is once or twice as well (each part)? But now I am worried fearing that wudu like this is not valid and that my salah is also not valid. Assure me that my wudu is valid and that my salah is valid? I have been doing wudu like this for about 2 years.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Wudhu will be valid if the limbs are washed only one time. The Sunnah\npractice is to wash the limbs three times.\n\nIt is contrary to the Sunnah to habitually wash the limbs only one time.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
