  "question": "what nullifies the wudhu?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\ndoes urinating nullify the wudhu? also, what happens to the salaat of previous years if our wudhu was not done correctly, or we read namaz without proper wudhu?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nEight things break Wudhu. They are called Nawaaqidh-e-Wudhu (breakers of\nWudhu). They are:\n1. Discharging of urine, stool or the coming out of anything from the\nprivate parts.\n2. Discharge of gases\n3. Vomitting mouthful\n4. To fall asleep lying down or by resting the body against something.\n5. To faint due to some illness of any other reason.\n6. Becoming insane or going mad.\n7. Laughing aloud whilst in Salaat.\n8. Flowing of blood or matter from any part of the body.\n\nIf the Wudhu of the previous years were done in such a way that the Faraaidh\nof Wudhu were omitted, then all those Salaats that were read with it should\nbe repeated.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
