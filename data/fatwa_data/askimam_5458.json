  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would be so thankful if u cud assist me wit problem ? I?m a 16 yr old girl. I?ve been speakin wit a Muslim guy online 4 about 7 months now & he claims 2 be totally in love wit me & wants 2 propose to me now but get married in a few yrs. He?s 4 days younger dan me. I like him but don?t love him. I kno i love dis other guy since I had 1st met him (At da age of 8) but due 2 complications I don?t eva think I?ll be able 2 marry him. He?s 2 yrs older dan me & is going overseas 2 do an Alim course which takes 10 yrs. I don?t believe I?m good enough 4 him. Our family?s r close & our elder?s hav alwaz thought our relationship as brother & sisterly. When I was like 10 we?ve both said we liked each other but nothin was dun about it. I think we were young then & maybe he doesn?t feel that way about me now although I still do. We barely talk now due 2 purdah & I kno I don?t have da courage to ask him now as I respect him 2 much & don?t wana make ne wrong moves. So I really believe I don?t hav a chance wit him. I?ve did istikhara for 5 days 2 seek the guidance of Allah if I should support & allow da Muslim guy online 2 come and propose but I still haven?t been implied anything in my dreams. My mother also knos about him & is willin to check him out but I would like to kno would it be permissible 4 me to marry him under these circumstances and would you be able 2 give me ne advise or ur opinion as 2 what I should do concerning da boy I do love (ignore the fact I love him)?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAll praise be to Allah who has given you the correct intention of getting\nmarried and not to indulge in the evils of the romance and out of marriage\nrelationships. However, it is prohibited to correspond with anyone of the\nopposite sex who you could marry (non-Mahrams).\n\nIt is advisable to concentrate on your personal Deeni upliftment at all\ntimes. Remember, evil and Haraam have bad and evil effects on one\nphysically, mentally and spiritually. Concentrate in nurturing yourself in\nthe necessities of being a pious wife and mother. Make Du'aa for a pious\nhusband at the same time. Insha Allah, you will be married to a pious,\nrighteous, understanding and caring husband through whose means you and your\nfamily will gain eternal bliss by pleasing Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
