  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamoalaykum.  My question is regarding breaking of the wudu when changing baby's diaper.  I am a nurse in pediatric area.  My work requires me to change baby's diaper several times a day.  Does this break my wudu?  When I have asked my elders, they say that the Wudu does break, as one might touch urine or feces while doing it.  I wear gloves while I am changing a diaper.  Does this still break my Wudu?  Please answer my query, as this issue has been somewhat bothersome to me.  Jazakallah Khair.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nUrine and feces are najis (impure) and it is necessary to wash them off, especially for prayer.  However, they do not break the wudū.  Therefore, even if you made skin contact with the urine or feces while changing diapers, it would still not break your wudū.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
