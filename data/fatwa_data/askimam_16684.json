  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it halal for a muslim to seek asylum in the west ie. USA,UK,Germany,Sweden, etc. on false pretext and live on the dole.\n\nPlease give a fatwa on this as many muslims in my country Sri Lanka is doing this\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIslam discourages one from lying and deceiving. Severe warnings have been mentioned in the Narrations of Nabi (Sallallahu 'Alaihi Wasallam) regarding those who lie and deceive. Islam does not permit one to lie even as a joke or to console small children. Lying is also considered as one of the signs of hypocrisy. Consider the following Ahadith of Nabi (Sallallahu 'Alaihi Wasallam):\n\n \n\nوعن عبد الله بن مسعود قال : قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : \" عليكم بالصدق فإن الصدق يهدي إلى البر وإن البر يهدي إلى الجنة وما يزال الرجل يصدق ويتحرى الصدق حتى يكتب عند الله صديقا . وإياكم والكذب فإن الكذب يهدي إلى الفجور وإن الفجور يهدي إلى النار وما يزال الرجل يكذب ويتحرى الكذب حتى يكتب عند الله كذابا \" . (متفق عليه)\n\nIt has been narrated on the authority of ‘Abdullah bin Mas’ood (Radhiyallahu 'Anhu) that Nabi (Sallallahu 'Alaihi Wasallam) said, “Always say the truth; as truth will lead one towards good deeds and good deeds will lead one to Jannah. When a person keeps on speaking the truth and is steadfast upon the truth, his name is written down amongst those who are truthful in the court of Allah. Keep away from lying; as lying will lead you towards transgression and transgression will lead you to Jahannam. When a person keeps on speaking lies and makes it his habit, his name is written down amongst the liars in the court of Allah.” (Bukhari & Muslim)\n\n \n\nوعن ابن عمر قال : قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : \" إذا كذب العبد تباعد عنه الملك ميلا من نتن ما جاء به \" . (رواه الترمذي)\n\nIt has been narrated on the authority of ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar (Radhiyallahu 'Anhu) that Nabi (Sallallahu 'Alaihi Wasallam) said, “When a person speaks a lie the angels move one mile away from him due to the smell that is emitted from the lie”. (Tirmidhi)\n\n \n\nوعن بهز بن حكيم عن أبيه عن جده قال : قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : \" ويل لمن يحدث فيكذب ليضحك به القوم ويل له ويل له \" . (رواه الترمذي)\n\nIt has been narrated on the authority of Bahz bin Hakim, who narrates from his father, who in turn narrates from his grandfather (Radhiyallahu 'Anhu) that Nabi (Sallallahu 'Alaihi Wasallam) said, “Woe be to the person who speaks lies to make people laugh, woe be to him, woe be to him”. (Tirmidhi)\n\n \n\nوعن عبد الله بن عامر قال : دعتني أمي يوما ورسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قاعد في بيتنا فقالت : ها تعال أعطيك . فقال لها رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : \" ما أردت أن تعطيه ؟ \" قالت : أردت أن أعطيه تمرا . فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : \" أما أنك لو لم تعطيه شيئا كتبت عليك كذبة \" . (رواه أبو داود)\n\n‘Abdullah bin ‘Aamir (Radhiyallahu 'Anhu) narrates, “Once my mother called me towards her whilst Rasulullah (Sallallahu 'Alaihi Wasallam) was sitting in our house. She said, “Come to me, I’ll give you something”. Nabi (Sallallahu 'Alaihi Wasallam) asked her, “What had you intended to give him?” She answered, “I had intended to give him a date”. Nabi (Sallallahu 'Alaihi Wasallam) said, “If you had not given him anything, one lie would have been written in your account.”” (Abu Dawood) \n\n \n\nوعن عبد الله بن عمرو أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : \" أربع من كن فيه كان منافقا خالصا ومن كانت فيه خصلة منهن كانت فيه خصلة من النفاق حتى يدعها إذا اؤتمن خان وإذا حدث كذب وإذا عاهد غدر وإذا خاصم فجر \"\n\nIt has been narrated on the authority of ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr (Radhiyallahu 'Anhu) that Nabi (Sallallahu 'Alaihi Wasallam) said, “There are four such qualities that whoever possesses them will e regarded a munafiq (hypocrite). Whoever possesses one of theses qualities will be regarded to have one quality of hypocrisy until he leaves it. When he is entrusted, he betrays. When he speaks, he lies. When he makes a promise, he breaks it. When he quarrels, he uses foul language.”  \n\n \n\nIn the light of the abovementioned, if Muslims seek asylum based on lies and false information given to the authorities, then that is a great sin for which tawbah and repentance is compulsory. Conversely, if they have genuinely been affected by the war and terrorist acts taking place in the country, then there is no harm in seeking asylum in these countries. However, great care should be taken in safeguarding there religion and the religion of their children. They should also regard this as an opportunity to invite the non-Muslims of these countries towards Islam, by showing good character and talking to them about Islam.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
