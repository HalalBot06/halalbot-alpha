  "question": "1.) ghair muqallid people ask \"who declares \"taqleed\" as Wajib, the authority of declaring anything farz, wajib etc is Allah and Messenger(saw)\".",
  "answer": "QUESTION\ni have two questions regarding taqleed, and please inform me as soon as possible. 1.) ghair muqallid people ask \"who declares \"taqleed\" as Wajib, the authority of declaring anything farz, wajib etc is Allah and Messenger(saw)\". please answer me. 2.) ghair muqallid people also quote a reference from the book of Fiqah Hanfi \"Noorul Anwar\", which states \"we do not act upon the \"khilaf-e-qayas\" Ahadees of Hazrat Anas(rta) and Hazrat Abu Huraira(rta) because they were not \"Faqih\". so please tell me about the reality.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Taqleed, i.e. for those who aren't sufficiently qualified to follow the qualified ones, is proven through many Ayaat of the Quran and through the Ijma of the Sahabah. This is sufficient to render it Wajib.\n\n2. This is the opinion of a Hanafi jurist Isa ibn Abaan, however the accepted view in the Hanafi Mazhab, is that the ahadith of these sahabah are accepted even if they defy logic.
