  "question": "The relationship between Allah's Essence and Attributes... What is the relationship between God's Essence and His Attributes?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nQ1: What is the relationship between God's Essence and His Attributes? Q2: Don't you think the Asharis and Maturidis adopt an illogical position (difficult to defend using logic and reason) when they state that God's Attributes are neither identical with His Essence nor are they seperate from it? I mean if we accept this, then we'd be accepting something illogical, then how can we accuse the Christians of being illogical when they believe in the Trinity? Q3: Why is it wrong to believe that God's Attributes are identical with His Essence? Q4: Is it kufr to believe that God's Attributes are identical with His Essence or is it an innovation? Q5: I am really getting attracted to the belief that God's Essence and His Attributes are identical. I have read the philosophical arguments in favour of this belief and they make a lot of sense to me. However, I am sad because I feel the Asharis and Maturidis are unable to defend their position using philosophical and logical arguments as their opponents do. How can reason/logic contradict revelation? That doesn't seem possible to me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou state that you read the philosophical arguments in favour of the attributes of Allah being identical as the being of Allah. Kindly forward those arguments to us and we shall most definitely answer them.\n\nOur position is that the Being of Allah and His attributes are common only in being Qadeem. How would you refute the argument of Ta?addud Qudama if both are exactly the same in every sense? How would you defend the issue of absolute Tawheed while believing in Zaat and Sifaat being One and the same? Is your position, Zaat and Sifaat, being one exclusive to Allah or general? If it is exclusive to Allah, how would you differentiate between Allah and His creation in that philosophy? If it is general, how would you explain that?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
