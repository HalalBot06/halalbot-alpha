However, it would be far better to make duaa in the words of Rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wasallam) as follows. “Allahumma Mattina Bi Asmaainaa Wa Absaarinaa Wa Quwwaatinaa Abadam Ma Abyaytana. Translation: “Oh Allah, Allow us to take full benefit from our hearing, our sight and maintain us (in this world).” This duaa is more inclusive and includes all aspects of your physical health.\n\n2.       Yes, it is permissible. However, you rather ask for Aafiyat with it.\n\n3.       Yes, it is permissible to make duaa-Hidaayat for a non-Muslim. Rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wasallam) made duaa of hidaayat for Umar (RA) before he embraced Islam.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalam\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
