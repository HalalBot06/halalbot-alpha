Could you please answer this question in light of shariah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nHajj is not compulsory on a person who does not have the financial means to perform Hajj. It is not necessary for him to borrow money to perform Hajj.\n\n \n\nHowever, if borrowed money is used for Hajj, it will be permissible and the obligation will be discharged.\n\n \n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
