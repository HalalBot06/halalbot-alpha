Is it Halal.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is a well known fact that the major source of income of the conventional banks is from interest bearing transactions. It is, therefore, not permissible for you to collect a direct reimbursement for your lunch.\n\nYou may request your company to reimburse you. The bank and the company could have their own internal arrangements.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
