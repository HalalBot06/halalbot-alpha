I also want to know that whether this bank is working according to the rules of SHARIAH, or is it doing anything against the SHARIAH?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf you have the opportunity to work and get experience at IDB (Islamic Development Bank) at Jeddah, you should not miss the opportunity. I cannot commence on the Shari’ah compliancy of all the issues of the Bank. However, I have been reliably informed that the IDB takes its rulings from the Fiqh Academy of Jeddah that comprises of respectable Ulama.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
