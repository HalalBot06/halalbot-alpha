  "question": "My husband did Istikhara that whether his stay in England is good for him or not......",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n my first question is this that my husband did Istikhara that whether his stay in England is good for him or not, so in that he saw a big horrible snake when he slept after istikhara namaz and dua.. Then some of his friends said that he does not offer five time prayers so it might not the correct sighns. Then my husband ask me to do Istikhara because I do offer five times prayers, so the first night I did not see any thing the next night I saw earthquake but after offering fajar prayers,\n\nThen the third day when I slept again I saw nothing..\n\nEven my feelings were normal when I wakeup…\n\nI kindly request u to please tell me what is good for both of us and what all this show..\n\nIm living in Pakistan where as my husband living in England and struggling for job. Finally he got an interview letter from one of the England company so now what you suggest for this interview call that if he gets the job so should he accept the offer or not.\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is our suggestion that your husband goes for the interview and if he is offered the job, he should make Istikhara then.  It is possible that since both of you are worried about him being without a job, and your frame of mind is not normal, that could have reflected negatively in the dream. \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\nThe guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\nEducation and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\nIslam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\nWhen one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\nMuslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\nWe have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\nIf you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\nIf that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\nRasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit”. \n\n \n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
