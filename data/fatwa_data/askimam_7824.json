  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have received emails from a discussion group (ahle-hadith living in Saudi Arabia) stating that all explanation of hanafi ulema'as are not according to the Quran, Hadith and Sunnah. According to these mail that followers of hanafi doing blind taqleed (blind-following) of ulema?a and scholars and these scholars reject the hadeeth just because they find the hadeeth to be in opposition to their madhhab. They give many examples of different act in light of Hadith that are not performing by Hanafi like 1. Raising hands before and after rukuh. 2. Reciting surah fatiha in Jamaat salat. 3. Time of aasr salat. 4. Praying sunnah of fajar after farz if not able to read before Farz. 4. Second sijdah-tilawat in surah hajj. 5. Allowing women in mosque and praying salat janaazah. They said that deobandis ulema?as and ahnaaf make additions to Hadeeth to prove their madhhab. According to them deobandis and ahle-sunnah are muqallid and doing taqleed of different ulema?as and they defines Taqleed as to follow a person blindly without any investigations or questions, which is Haraam in Islam and Muqallid is the person who has nothing to do with anything from investigations, but has to follow it without questioning not even to seek knowledge. According to these group people that it is not necessary to practice and taqleed only one madhhab like hanafi and shaafi. These mails many times give reference of fatwas of Saudi Alim.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThese claims are totally baseless and false. The Hanafis are also practicing on Ahaadith. In fact, the way those who follow Madhab, i.e. Hanafi, Hanbali, Maakili and Shaafi?ee are following Hadith is a more superior way than those who do not follow a Madhab because Muqallideen place their trust on those who were closer to the time of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and were Mujtahideen and experts whereas those who do not follow Madhab follows their Nafs and desires. Lets examine some of their claims:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. ?Raising hands before and after Ruku? ? Abdullah ibn Mas?ood (Radhiallaahu Anhu) said, ?Should I not inform you of the Salaat of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)?? He then stood up and raised his hands the first time (for Takbiratul Ihraam). Thereafter, he did not repeat it, i.e. raising of the hands. (Sunan Sughra of Nasaaie vol.1 pg.158)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. ?Reciting Surah Faatiha in Jamaat Salaat? ? Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), ?The Imaam is appointed so that he is followed. So, when he says Allahu Akbar you should (also) say Allaahu Akbar and when he reads you should remain silent.? (Sahih Muslim vol.1 pg.174)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. ?Allowing women in Mosque? ? Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha) says, ?If Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) saw the condition of the women today, he would have prevented them from coming to the Musjid just as the women of Bani Israaeel were prevented from coming to the Musjid.? (Sahih Bukhari vol.2 pg.120)%0D%0A%0D%0AThese are just some of Ahaadith proving the view of the Hanafis. In the same way, the other Aimmah, i.e. Maaliki, Hanbali and Shaafi?ee, have their own proofs and methods of reaching conclusions. Kindly refer attached ?
