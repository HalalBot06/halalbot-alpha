  "question": "Can the charges of debt collectors, be added to the actual amount that is being owed to me.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf an amount of let's say R100,00 is owed to me. I then hand over this debt, for collection to a debt collection agency, who will then charge me a 25% collection fee of all the money they collect. Let's say they do collect the full R100,00 - the agency would pay me only R75,00. Would it be permissible to rather tell the agency that the client owes me R133.34, such that when they collect this R133,34 and deduct their 25% then I would still receive my original R100,00 owing to me and not loose out the R25,00 if they were to collect on R100,00\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, it is incorrect to claim any amount more than your debt.\n\nHowever, as an alternative, we suggest you enter into an agreement with your\ndebtors that in the event of the debt not being repaid, you (the company)\nshall hire a debt agency to recover the debt. Any costs in this regard will\nbe borne by the debtor, not by the company.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
