  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam Bro-friend had fallen in love with a hindu girl, n she converted into Islam and they were about to get married, but suddenly her health became bad and she died! My brother cannot forget her, I tried explaining him and cosoling him..but no use..? he always becomes v. depressed. We tried to get him married?but cant find ne girl ! plz advice me what to do to help him..jazakAllah khairan\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour brother is fortunate for having been successful in influeincing the\ngirl to Islam. He will be immersely rewarded for that. The girl is also\nfortunate. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Whosoever recites\nthe Kalima (accepts Islam) and passes away will enter paradise.' (Bukhari).\n\nIt is natural for your brother to be sad and depressed at the loss of the\ngirl who he loved and hoped to marry. It is our advice that he be given time\nto recover from this apparent set back. He should also be advised to be\npatient and seek Allah's reward in his grief. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) also went through these difficulties with life.\n\nMay Allah Ta'ala grant your brother courage and a speedy recovery, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
