  "question": "A person lied for eligibility of donated goods, what should he do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI know a person that has some school supplies such as books, pencils, jackets, shoes and school bags. He received them from a place that donates school supplies to people who cannot afford them. He received them in a wrong way by saying that they live in a different address than the one they really live in and by mentioning fake schools.\n\nDoes this make the supplies given, jackets, etc. haram? He also gave some of these things to charities and other people for trade. If these supplies that this person has is haram then does he have to give the rest of these supplies in charity or does he have to throw it away? If he has to throw it away then does he have to take back that which he had given to the others?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nThe goods received by this individual have been gained through lies and deception. The acts of lying and deceiving are qualities which are totally inconsistent to the lifestyle of a Muslim.\n\nNabi salallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam is reported to have said,\n\nمَنْ غَشَّنَا فَلَيْسَ مِنَّا\n\n“Whoever deceives us, he is not from amongst us.”\n\n(Sahīh Muslim Vol. 1 Pg. 99, Dārul Ahyā’ Aturāth Al ‘arabī [1]\n\n \n\nThe goods that he has acquired should be returned to the owner. He should also make Istighfaar and cry in shame for the wrong and deception he committed.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\nMawlana Ali bin Cassim\nStudent Darul Iftaa\nLos Angeles, CA (USA)\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net\n\n\n\n\n[1] صحيح مسلم 1/ 99؛ دار إحياء التراث العربي"
