  "question": "Who should keep the baby since they are not married and will not get married?Are there institutions for adoption in the Islamic way in the USA?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nA Muslim boy got involved with a christian girl in America. The girl became pregnant. He was living in her flat for more than a year. She is a church leader. She says that she wants to become a Muslim but it is not sincere. The boy is studying there. At the moment he is very confused and furious at his parents. He says, that the baby to be born will be my child whom I cannot neglect although he has no means to support. The baby is to be born in 3 months time The parents when they came to know first they removed him from her flat almost by force. They rented an apartment and the boy is now living in it. The parents told him to stop the relationship because it is haraam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nmIn principle, it is permissible for a Muslim male to marry a female from\namong the people of the book, Christian or Jew. However, if there is fear\nthat the Muslim male may be influenced by his wife to Christianity or\nJudaism and may turn away from Islam, then it is not permissible for him to\nmarry such a female.\n\nIn the enquired case, since the girl expressed her wish to accept Islam, it\nmay be prudent to embrace the opportunity for the boy to marry her. By doing\nso, the child will be well taken care of and risen as a Muslim by both\nparents. A sensitive matter of this nature should handled with much care and\nrational. It is generally noticed that matters governed by emotions and\nfeelings are extensively intensified and only ignites huge flames of anger,\nthus, magnifying an already provoked situation. The boy's parents should\nheed this advise.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
