Your fear Allah and abstain from this sin immediately. Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said \"the eyes commit Zina, and the Zina of the eyes are to look at a strange woman\". Therefore, you should consult with your parents and possible consider Nikah to her if you fear you would not be able to contain yourself.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
