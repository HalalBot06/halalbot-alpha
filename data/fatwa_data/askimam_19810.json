  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am seeking guide lines for the employment /contract of Mueazin to be employed. What are the terms and condition of employment.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nBefore attending to your request of providing guidelines for an employment contract for a muaddhin, we take this opportunity to record a few of the numerous merits and virtues of a muaddhin.\n\n1.       Hazrat Mu’āwiyah radhiallahu anhu says that he heard Rasulullah sallallahu alaihi wasallam say:\n\n \n\nالْمُؤَذِّنُونَ أَطْوَلُ النَّاسِ أَعْنَاقًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ[i]\n\n The muaddhins’ will have the longest necks on the Day of Judgement (They will be more deserving of Allah’s mercy and reward than other people).\n\n\n(Sunan-Ibn-Mājah- Vol: 1 - Pg: 240 – Dar Ihyā al kutub al-arabiyyah)\n\n \n\n2.       Hazrat Ibn Abbās radhiallahu anhuma narrates that Rasulullah sallallahu alaihi wasallam said:\n\n \n\nمَنْ أَذَّنَ سَبْعَ سِنِينَ مُحْتَسِبًا كُتِبَتْ لَهُ بَرَاءَةٌ مِنَ النَّارِ[ii]\n\nWhosoever calls out the adhān for seven years with the intention of gaining reward; he will be granted protection against the fire of Hell.\n\n(Sunan-Tirmidhi - Vol: 1 - Pg: 281 – Daral gharb al Islāmi)\n\n \n\n \n\n3.      Hazrat Abū Sa’īd narrates that he heard the following from Rasulullah:\n\n \n\nلاَ يَسْمَعُ مَدَى صَوْتِ المُؤَذِّنِ، جِنٌّ وَلاَ إِنْسٌ وَلاَ شَيْءٌ، إِلَّا شَهِدَ لَهُ يَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ[iii]\n\n \n\nWhoever hears the adhān, be it a human being, a jinn or any other creature, it will be a witness and testify for the muaddhin on the Day of Resurrection.\n\n(Sahih-al-Bukhārī - Vol: 1 - Pg: 125 – Dar Tūq an-Najāh)\n\nWe make dua that Allah Ta῾ālā grants us the ability to understand the high and lofty position of a muaddhin, Aameen.\n\nAnswer:\n\nIn principle, hiring a muaddhin is an ijārah (hiring) contract.
