  "question": "What are the responsibilities of a Muslim man who fathered a child out of wedlock and what are the rights of these children?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThere is a popular belief surfacing among a certain sect of Muslim men that is giving them the impression that they have no responsibilities toward children they have fathered out of wedlock.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPrincipally, a child born out of wedlock is not attributed to the biological\nfather. The reason being to condemn such illicit and Haraam acts.\n\nIf Shari'ah grants the child recognition, people will continue with\nadulterous relationships. The mother of the child must bear the consequences\nof her consent to the Haraam act. That will serve as an eye-opener to other\nfemales not to consent to a Haraam thereby suffering the consequences all by\nherself.\n\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
