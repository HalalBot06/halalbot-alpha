  "answer": "QUESTION\nis there any proof of \"rasm-e-Bismillah\" and \"rasm-e-khatmul Quran\" of child ? is there any proof from Sahaba(rta) or four imams.? is it Bida'h.?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen a child embarks on the task of learning or memorising the Qur?aan, he requires every type of help and assistance available. The best way to assist him is for his parents, relatives and the pious to make du?aa for him that his task becomes easy and that he fulfils this task. As far as the recitation of Bismillah is concerned, it comes in one narration that Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] mentioned, ?Any important task which is begun without taking the name of Allah, it will lack blessings.? What can be more noble than the task of learning or memorising the Qur?aan.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe khatam and completion of the Qur?aan is also a very significant and auspicious occasion. This is the time when Allah accepts a person?s du?aa. It is mentioned that Hadhrat Anas [Radhiallaahu anhu] used to gather his family and neighbours at the time of Khatamul Qur?aan with this hope that they would be blessed through the Qur?aan.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, one should remember that this custom is permissible with the condition that it is not done with the intention of Sunnah and nor should it be made compulsory for then it will fall under the category of bid?ah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AQari Ismail Abdul Aziz%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN QUR?AANIC SCIENCES & RECITATIONS%0D%0A%0D%0Achecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
