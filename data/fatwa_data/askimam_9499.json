Jaza kalah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe advise that if you are inclined to the girl you saw in your dream, then\nfind out more about her character, conduct, etc. Consult with appropriate\npeople and also make Istikhaara.\n\nIf the results are positive, then propose to her for marriage. If she is in\nyour Taqdeer, then she will accept. If not, then search for another suitable\nperson.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
