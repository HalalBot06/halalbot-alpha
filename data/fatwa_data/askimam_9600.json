Earlier I asked few questions bet till today I have not get any answer for that please do reply me on this time.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Mazi refers to that liquid which comes out at the time of excitement and does not leave a person satisfied. Mazi is Najis and breaks Wudhu. Hence, merely cleaning your private parts will not suffice. In order for you to perform Salaat, you will have to renew your Wudhu and cleanse your private parts and clothes from all the Najaasat.\n\n2. According to the Shari?ah, it is not permissible to speak to any Ghayr Mahram women unless there is a need and necessity. Hence, you should immediately refrain from having any unnecessary conversation with any Ghayr Mahram women whether it be over the phone or on a personal level. Even when you have to speak to such women, you should kee the conversation as brief as possible and to the point.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
