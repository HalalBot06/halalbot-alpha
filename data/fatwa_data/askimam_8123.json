  "question": "someone asks you for forgiveness for hurting you, but because of the intensity of the pain they have caused, you cannot forgive them...Does that then turn the tables and make you the bad one ??",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf someone has said or done things to hurt another badly but that might be the influence of jinn(not being possessed but possibly influenced by some other means),is that person \"scott free\" and absolved of any responsibility for the pain they have caused? Also if someone asks you for forgiveness for hurting you (maybe because of jinn maybe not)but because of the intensity of the pain they have caused, you cannot forgive them(even though you know that one should forgive others and Allah will forgive you)Does that then turn the tables and make you the bad one and the other person in the clear? And will Allah then not forgive you?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was sent as Rahmatu llil aalameen. This is professed in the biography of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nThe Kuffaar of Makkah tormented and tortured Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). The beloved uncle of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), Hamza (Radhiallaahu Anhu), was killed and his body mutilated, yet Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) forgave the killer. We say that we are the followers of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and we love him. Thus, we should try to emulate his teachings. Forgive and forget except if one is hurting Deen. Remember well, one is not absolved of his evil except if he makes Tawbah and if it is someone else?s right, then forgiveness must be sought from him or her.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
