  "question": "Taking Bath During Fasting",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nHow would someone, who is fasting, take bath after having intercourse? In gargling there is a chance that drops of water would enter his throat and then to his stomach. Should one gargle or should one just clean his mouth (internally) with water?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is necessary to rinse the mouth when performing a Farz bath. However, extreme caution has to be taken that water does not go down the throat. If the water does go down the throat while fasting, the fast will be invalidated.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
