Its been 5 months and our family are not talking anymore.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA Muslim court with full authority is needed in order to annul a Nikah. If there is a group in your vicinity that handles the affairs of the Muslims then that group should appoint three 'Aalims or a group of three individuals in which at least one is an 'Aalim and give them the right to solve the family and marital problems in light of the Shari'ah. You should forward your case to them which they can solve through the books of jurisprudence e.g. Heela-e-Naajizah by Moulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi (R.A.A.) and Majmoo'ah Qawaneen by Muslim Personal Law board India. They can also refer to us in this regard. We, from South Africa, cannot directly do anything to annul your marriage. If there is no special well arranged group of such in your vicinity, then the Masjid committee can also appoint the abovementioned three individuals. %0D%0A%0D%0AThe best solution to this problem of yours is that you should urge and pressurize him (through the court or otherwise) to utter or write the words of Talaaq-e-Baain (irrevocable divorce). You can also ask him for Khulaa (i.e. divorce in exchange of your pardoning him of the dowry that he owes you, etc.) You can further consult the Ulamaa of your locality in this regard%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Ashraf%0D%0ADARUL IFTA ?
