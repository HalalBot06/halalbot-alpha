  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nis it permissible to give adhaan with only the right hand raised to the ear. does one have to turn the head when one says `hayaallsalaah and hayalalfalaah`. i have witnessed these practices in a local musjid in my area.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is mustahab to raise the hands to the ears when calling out the Adhaan. If one raises only one hand to the ears, the mustahab will be fulfilled. (Raddul Muhtaar Pg. 388. HM Saeed)\nIt is Sunnah to turn to the right and left when saying “Hayya Alus Salaah” and “Hayya Alal Falaah” in the Adhaan. (Durre Mukhtar Pg. 387 HM Saeed)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala knows best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
