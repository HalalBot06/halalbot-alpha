  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ncan a boy marry a girl if they are in love and have slept together also\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is imperative that we understand the seriousness of our actions. A true believer is one who will ponder first before committing any action so that he may judge the outcome and repercussion of his/her actions. The boy and the girl have committed fornication. This is haraam as well as a major sin. They should severe all relations immediately if they wish to thread the correct path. Nevertheless, the damage is done and sincere repentance ought to be made.\n\nIn order for major sins to be forgiven, sincere repentance is a condition. Firstly, a person should recognize that what he/she has done is wrong. Secondly, we need to be remorseful of the action committed. Thirdly, we need to acquire a firm determination that we will  never do the act again, and finally, we need to ask Allah Ta’ala for forgiveness.\n\n \n\nHazrat Abu Bakr (Radiallahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said, if a Muslim regrettably falls into some sin, he should make wudhu and offer two raka’ats of nafl salaah, that sin will be forgiven. This is known as salaatul taubah. (prayer of repentance)\n\n (Musnad Ahmad & Ibn Kathir)\n\n \n\nThe question or thought as to whether the boy and girl can marry is baseless. Most definitely they can marry. Infact the marriage ought to be done as quick as possible as they have found themselves suitable for one another and have taken it to the next level. It is only through the of marriage will one experience blessings and eternal happiness. Marriage is a religious duty, a moral safeguard as well as a social necessity. Through marriage families are established and is regarded to be an essential component of our society. It is also a form of Ibaadah because it is obeying Allah Ta’ala and his messenger (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam). It is not a matter that can be taken lightly and should be entered into with total commitment and full knowledge of what it involves. Marriage is not like buying a new dress where you can exchange it if you do not like it. Your partner should be your choice and the choice of your parents for life. One should be mature enough to understand the demands of marriage so that the can be a lasting one.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
