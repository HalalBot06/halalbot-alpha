  "question": "Please tell me the du'a I should pray in Arabic which comes after 'Ina lillah wa inna ilay he ra je oon'.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n(1)  Please tell me the du'a I should pray in Arabic which comes after 'Ina lillah wa inna ilay he ra je oon'.  It is asking ALLAH to give me something better.   When a calamity or  loss falls on a Muslim - this is recited.\n\n(2)  Is it fardh to wear a niqaab for hanafis?  Please explain as I am reading a lot of different things regarding women having to cover their faces.  This leads to confusion.  \n\n(3) What does wajib and mustahab mean?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The du’aa to be recited at the time when a calamity or loss befalls a Muslim is, ‘Innaa lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raaji’oon. Allaahumma ajurnee fiy museebatiy wakhluf lee khayran minhaa.’ (Verily, we belong to Allah and to him we shall return. Oh Allah, reward me in my calamity and recompensate me with something better than I have lost). Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] mentions in a Hadith that whoever recites the above mentioned du’aa when a calamity befalls him, Allah will reward him and grant him something better in lieu of what he has lost. Umm-e-Salmah [radhiallaahu anha] says, ‘When my husband, Abu Salmah, passed away, I recited the very same du’aa and Allah granted me a better husband who was Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam].’ (Muslim Hadith2124)\n\n2. It is Waajib upon a woman to wear the Niqaab according to the Hanafi Madhab. This means that if a woman leaves it out, she will be sinful. (Ahkaamul Qur’aan vol.3 pg.476)\n\n3. Waajib is an act which has to be practised upon incumbently in the Shari’a like how it is incumbent on a Muslim to fulfil a Fardh act. Similarly, it is obligatory to fulfil a Waajib act. The difference between Fardh and Waajib is that if a person refuses to recognise a Fardh act as Fardh, he will come out of the fold of Islam whereas if a person refuses to recognise a Waajib act he will not come out of the fold of Islam, rather he will be sinful. (Raddul Muhtaar vol.1 pg.274). Mustahabb is a voluntary act which is highly commendable in the Shari’ah. There is no sin for leaving it out.
