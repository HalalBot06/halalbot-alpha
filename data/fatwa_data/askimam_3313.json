  "question": "Is it a form of shirk if you sometimes pray sunnah at the mosque because other people might look down upon you or look at you in a funny way?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI sometimes do this because I do not want to look the odd one out. I do not always pray the sunnah prayer, but at mosques i usually do. I dont necessarily pray because of the muslims there, but because of embarassment. I know it is wrong, but is it shirk?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShari'ah has placed lots of emphasis on Sunnah. Allah Ta'ala says in the%0D%0Anoble Qur'aan, 'Verily for you in the way of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) is a beautiful way.' In another verse, Allah Ta'ala states,%0D%0A'Whatever your Rasul gives you, take it (practise upon it).%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Whosoever perform twelve%0D%0ARakaats (Sunnah) Salaats everyday (two Rakaats before Fajr, four before%0D%0ADhuhr, two after Dhuhr, two before Asr, two after Maghrib and two after Esha%0D%0ASalaat), Allah will prepare an abode for him in Jannah. Sunnah Salaats%0D%0Acovers up the shortcoming in Fardh Salaats.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn view of the above, you should endervour to perform the Sunnats before and%0D%0Aafter the Fardh Salaats. The Fuqahaa have stated that if one is certain that%0D%0Ahe will not perform his Sunnah Salaats at home, he should perform them at%0D%0Athe Musjid. Generally, unity in practise relieves one from the difficulty of%0D%0Athe practise when performing Salaat. You should place your gaze on Allah Ta'%0D%0Aala as the purpose of Salaat is to please Him and not people. Do not bother%0D%0Aabout people's feelings and looks towards you.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
