  "question": "Is it permissable to perform Haj for some one else. has asked me if I would pray Haj on behalf of his mother's foi who died",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAlhamdulillah I have prayed Haj at age 12. I was Baligh but I did not understand things well I also did not have a lot of insight. I am really grateful for the opportunity, however I feel that if I go now I will do much better. I have the means, I wish I could have another chance to do it better with greater understanding. My husband is thinking about going but he has asked me if I would pray Haj on behalf of his mother's foi who died. I do not know if she expressed any intention to pray Haj before she passed away. I don't know what to do. Please advise me. Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for you to perform Haj on her behalf, even if she did not bequest it. If haj was Fard on her, then it is hoped of Allah that he will allow this haj to substitute the haj that was Fard on her and if Haj was never Fard on her, then she will receive the Reward of this Haj, inshallah.
