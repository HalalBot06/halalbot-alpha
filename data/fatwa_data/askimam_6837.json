This is when your Iddat of divorce - waiting period ? (which is 3 menstrual periods if you experience menses or three months if you do not experience menses or till birth if you are conceived) is completed from the first marriage, you may get married to another person and consummate the marriage. The second husband then issues you a Talaaq voluntarily. Thereafter, you sit in Iddat. After the Iddat, you may remarry the first husband."
