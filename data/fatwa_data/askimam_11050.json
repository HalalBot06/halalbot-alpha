  "question": "If universe is created, Allah acted to create the universe after previously not having acted ... Does this not imply that Allah underwent change ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe Saheeh Aqida is that Allah is the Creator of the universe and that He does not undergo change. However, recently some doubts have started coming to my mind and I was hoping that you would help me out (by mentioning some of the arguments of the mutakallimeen). If the universe is created (which it most certainly is) then Allah acted to create the universe after previously not having acted (which is why the universe was non-existent and then came into existence). Does this not imply that Allah underwent change, which would be against Saheeh Aqida, since Allah had previously not acted and had then acted to bring the universe into existence. Plz help me out here.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two aspects of Allah ? His Zaat (Being) and His Af?aal (Actions).\n\nThe Zaat of Allah never changes. His Zaat has been the same before His creations and after His creations. However, the creations of Allah (Makhlooq) are the manifestations of His quality of Khalq (to create). This quality of Allah as well as His other qualities ? Sama, Basr, etc. are all Azli like the very Being of Allah and never changes. The effects of the qualities of Allah on the creations of Allah does not change the Zaat or the qualities of Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
