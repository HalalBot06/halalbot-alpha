  "question": "Did talaq take place with these words?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI was fighting my wife on the phone she abused me and I became very angry many times I said, “I don’t want you, I don’t want you” after that I wrote one SMS. The SMS was “I don’t want you I want to Talaaq you, just Talaaq nothing else. I want to Talaaq you I don’t want you.” After half and hour I awake and I think she is my life I love her how I can Talaaq to her I did not Talaaq please inform me I want to know did the Talaaq take or not.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nIn order to issue divorce, the words of divorce must be mentioned in an imperative sense. For example “I give you one talaaq.” By merely stating the wish or desire to issue talaaq, talaaq will not take place.[1]\n\n \n\nThe statement, “I don’t want you I want to Talaaq you, just Talaaq nothing else. I want to Talaaq you I don’t want you” will not constitute Talaaq.[2] These statements merely express a wish.\n\n \n\nYou should be extremely careful in using the word of talaaq. Many times, in a fit of anger one makes a mistake and he regrets for the rest of his life.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Ali bin Cassim\n\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nLos Angeles, CA (USA)\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[1] الفتاوى الهندية - ط. دار الفكر (1/ 384)\n\nخِلَافِ قَوْلِهِ كَنَمِّ لِأَنَّهُ اسْتِقْبَالٌ فلم يَكُنْ تَحْقِيقًا بِالتَّشْكِيكِ\n\n[2]الفتاوى الهندية - ط. دار الفكر - (1 / 384)\n\nفي الْمُحِيطِ لو قال بِالْعَرَبِيَّةِ أُطَلِّقُ لَا يَكُونُ طَلَاقًا إلَّا إذَا غَلَبَ اسْتِعْمَالُهُ لِلْحَالِ فَيَكُونُ طَلَاقًا\n\nفتاوى محمودية 12/248؛ فاروقية"
