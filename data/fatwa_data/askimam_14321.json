  "question": "irreversible contraceptives are not allowed.. but how can I go abt with the reversible ones",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nFirstly I like to thank you for your great informative website. But I have one problem with it, and that is it is so hard to get a question thru u because more than half the time the quota is filled!! Is there any other way to go abt?\n\nNow my questions are\n\n- I'm pregnant with twins and this is my third pregnancy. I really don't plan to have more children but you've mentioned that irreversible contraceptives are not allowed.. but how can I go abt with the reversible ones which are neither 100% safe? I frankily don't think I can go through more pregnancies. May Allah forgive me.\n\n- Can you recommend some duwas to recite for a short tempered person. This short tempered person tends to cuss in front of everyone and its highly disgraceful. I would appreciate an advice\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf your medical history suggests that you will not be in a position to bear another pregnancy, it will be permissible to use irreversible contraceptives.\n\nHe should recite Aauzubillahi minashaytaanir rajeem as often as possible.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
