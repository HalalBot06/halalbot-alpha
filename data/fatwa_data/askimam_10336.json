  "question": "I am a university student and have taken out a loan to help me with my studies. Under what circumstances must I pay the loan back, the loan is taken from the kafir in their country (U.K)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, we wish to point out that it is not permissible to take out an interest bearing loan.
