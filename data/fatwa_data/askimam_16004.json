  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat are the times for making qurbani and can we slaughter after maghrib/esha on the first day of qurbani to the last day before ASR?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe timings for qurbani are from the 10th of Zil Hajjah until the sunset of 12th of Zil Hajjah.  The best day for qurbani is the day of Eid al-Adha (10th of Zil Hajjah), followed by the 11th and then the 12th of Zil Hajjah.\n\nIt is not permissible to make qurbani prior to Eid Salah. Those residing in villages and farms that are at a distance from the place of Eid Salah may perform the qurbani before Eid.\n\nQurbani can be made at any time of the day on the 10th and 11th of Zil Hajjah. However, it is preferable to do qurbani at day time for the fear of not cutting due to darkness. Qurbani on the 12th of Zil Hajjah must be made before sunset.  It is not permissible to do it after sunset.\n\nBahishti Zewar (1/315) Zamzam Publishers\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nMl.
