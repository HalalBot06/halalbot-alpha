  "question": "Why is it prohibited for a Muslim man and women to have a relationship outside of marriage?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRelationships outside or before marriage.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAny relationship out of marriage is strictly prohibited. If both parties are\nnot legally committed by shariah to one another there is a potential of\nabusing one another by merely fulfiling their carnal desires and thereafter\nabandoning one another. The matter can become more complex if the female\nbecomes conceived in this illegal relationship, which is followed by the\nquestion of abortion, illegitimate children, abandoning such children, etc.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
