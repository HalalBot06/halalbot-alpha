Is it Ok if we do istikhara for him.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nGambling is expressly prohibited in the Qur?aan. It is not permissible to gamble or be part of gambling in any way whatsoever. That includes installing a gambling machine in one?s business.\n\nIt is not permissible to run a business in which one is required to have a lottery machine. That is assisting in sin. Allah Ta?ala states, ?And do not assist in sin.? (Maaidah)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
