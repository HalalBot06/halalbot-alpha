  "question": "What should be my conduct with my father's younger brother under these circumstances? My uncle has been known to indulge in alcohol & other vices. His friends indulge in all these vices with him.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy grandfather had passed away when my uncle was very young & my father and his elder brother brought up my uncle [ their youngest brother.] Due to too much indulgence in business, I believe my father could not spend much time on the upbrining of my uncle as far as religious knowledge etc. is concerned. Neither did my father ever attempt to rectify his behavior later on. That's why I believe he has gone so far. According to my father, my uncle has also mis-appropriated a lot of money from my father from the days when they were both doin business together. That's why they are both not even on speaking terms with each other. My father does not like it very much if I try to visit my uncle with the intention of keeping family realations as advised by Rasullah Sallahu Alayhi Wasallam. Please advise me how should I conduct myself with my uncle? Should I ever greet him and go to visit him. I do not foresee his reformation via my keeping ood relations with him. Please advise!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKeep a relationship with him to an such an extent that you and your family will not be affected by his bad habits, while at the same time you can endeavour to help him gain rectification. Regularly make dua for him and request the local jamaat brothers to visit him as well.\n\nMay Allah rectify us all.Amin\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
