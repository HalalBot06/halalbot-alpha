Hazrat replied that they should read Qasdus Sabeel. The person replied that he has read it but he doesn’t understand. Hazrat told him to ask someone who understands it to explain it to him. He ignorantly replied that I don’t consider anyone but Allah to have the ability to make me understand.\n\nHazrat mentioned: what cure is there for a person who has such a bad understanding and lack of intelligence?"
