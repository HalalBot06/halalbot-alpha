  "question": "As-Salaam-u-Alaikum. My question concerns practices at the time of Fajr. I am not sure if they are superstitions or Islamically correct. Please read details.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThere are two things which I have been told to do at the time of Fajr : 1) Open a window or door so that the angels can come into the house. 2) Pray Fajr Salaat with the lights off. Are these true or just superstition.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There is no basis in Shari'ah to open the windows or doors for angels to\nenter the house. Angels are not restricted from entering a house with closed\ndoors or closed windows.\n2. There is also no Shar'ee basis to switch off the lights during Fajr\nSalaat. However, the lights may be switched off for whatever reason, for\nexample, if it hurts the eyes in the early part of the morning or for\nconcentration, etc.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
