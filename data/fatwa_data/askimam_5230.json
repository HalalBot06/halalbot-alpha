  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nSalaat must be offered at fixed time. Allah Ta’ala says in the noble\nQur’aan, ‘Salaat at set time has been made a duty on the believers.’ (Surah\nAn-Nisaa 4:103)\n\nTimings of Salaat are:\n\nFajr\nFrom true dawn until just before sunrise.\n\nPreferable to offer when it is light, not very dark, but preferable to delay\non cloudy day.\n\nDhuhr\nAfter midday until afternoon (when a shadow of a vertical object is twice\nit’s length plus the meridian shadow).\n\nPreferable to offer in summer after the intense heat rays elapse. In winter\nat the beginning time but preferable to delay on cloudy day.\n\nAsr\nFrom late afternoon (when a shadow of a vertical object is twice it’s length\nplus the meridian shadow) until just before sunset.\n\nPreferable to delay to such an extent that the sun does not turn yellow but\npreferable to offer a bit early on cloudy day.\n\nMaghrib\nAfter sunset until daylight ends.\n\nPreferable to offer immediately after sunset and not to delay to the extent\nthat many stars begin to appear in the sky but preferable to delay on cloudy\nday.\n\nIshaa\nNight (after twilight) until dawn.\n\nPreferable to offer before one third of the night passes.\n\n[ Mufti Ismail Kachholvi, UK ]\n\nForbidden times for Salaat:\na) Sunrise, b) Zawaal (midday), c) Sunset.\n\nMakrooh times:\nAfter the Fardh Fajr and Asr Salaats, it is Makrooh to recite any Nafl\n(optional) Salaat. However, Qadhaa Salaat, Sajda-e-Tilaawat recited at that\ntime or Janaaza Salaat could be performed at these times.\n\nSalaat times differ according to places and countries. Thus, contact you\nlocal Ulama for details and further clarification regarding Salaat times.\n\nSajda-e-Sahw will become Waajib if one forgets to sit for Tashahhud in the\nsecond Rakaat of a 4 Rakaat Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
