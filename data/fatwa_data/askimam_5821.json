  "question": "Is money earned by a person who has come on visiting visa to abroad haram or halal ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam alikum dear muftisab, My aunty's husband is a very lazy person. (aunty means ny mother's sister and my aunty has two sons). He won't earn any money for their family and my aunty's family is at present dependent on my mother.(I mean my aunty is dependent on her sister's family. ) We are at present staying in London for one year and left our child in India while we came to London because of certain reasons (majboories) and now we are going to bring our child to London. As our daughter is very much attached to my aunty we are planning to bring my aunty also to London on visting visa and i think she can stay here for 6 months. Now what is my question is that She knows tailoring, can she earn money through tailoring here? I mean she may sit at home and stich the dresses of known people or if possible she may stich by her own and sell them to them. Why I am asking this is a person who comes on visiting visa can not work legally. It is illegal in United Kingdom. Is it allowed Islamically?If my aunt earn money by stitching cloths here,Will the money become haram? If this is halal,Insha Allah this money will matter much to her family back in india. Actually we have not yet decided to do like this nor we are bringing her for the sake of earning money but we bringing her only for the sake of our child.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe services offered by your aunty is a private venture. She may earn an\nincome through that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
