It is not permissible for a woman to serve a Ghayr Mahram (not prohibited%0D%0Ain marriage) male irrespective of him being an Aalim or a relative.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. She does not have to make Qadhaa Salaat for Dhuhr Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. It is permissible for a female to recite verses of the Qur'aan having%0D%0Ameanings of Du'aa, for example, 'Rabbanaa aatinaa fid dunyaa hasanatan wa fil aakhirat hasanatan waqinaa adhaaban naar.'%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Islamic garb for women - refer below%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala says in the noble Qur'aan, 'O Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) say toyour wives, your daughters and to the women of the Mu'mineen%0D%0Athat they draw over them their Jilbaabs (outer cloaks or Burqahs). That%0D%0A(covering themselves with Jilbaab) is the least (minimum requirement which%0D%0Athey should adopt) so that they be recognised and not be molested (by%0D%0Ashameless people of loose morals).' (Ahzaab 59)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe word, 'Jilbaab' which appears in the Aayat is the plural of the word%0D%0A'Jilbaab'. Hadhrat Ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) says that a Jilbaab is%0D%0Asuch a garment which covers the entire body. (Tafseer Roohul Ma'aan vol.22%0D%0Apg.88)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe word, 'Khimaar' which appears in another Aayat refers to the%0D%0Ascarf%2Fhead-covering which is generally worn and is for daily use, but when%0D%0Athere is a need for the woman to emerge from the home, then it is necessary%0D%0Afor her to don the Jilbaab.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) further states, 'The women must cover%0D%0Atheir faces and heads with their Jilbaabs and leave only one eye exposed%0D%0A(covered).' (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Ubaydah Salmaani (Radhiallaahu Anhu) was asked by Muhammad ibn%0D%0ASireen regarding this Aaayat, then Hadhrat Salmaani demonstrated (as a means%0D%0Aof explanation) by covering his head and face with his shawl and he left his%0D%0Ahead and face with his shawl and he left his left eye exposed.%0D%0A%0D%0A(Tafseer Roohul Ma'aan vol.22 pg.89; Tafseer Mazhari vol.10 pg.252 (Urdu);%0D%0ATafseer Mawaahibur Rahmaan vol.5 pg.113)%0D%0A%0D%0A"
