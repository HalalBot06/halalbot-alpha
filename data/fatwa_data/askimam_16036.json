Should one year be completed for the payment of Zakath and giving Quarbani.\n\n2. I have heard that If a crows's nijasath falls over us it is necessary to do Gusul. Is thi right. What if the same thing falls over Cloths that we are wearing.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1.There are three issues to your query\n\nExchange of jewellery\nZakaat\nQurbaani\n\nAt the outset, you should understand that according to Shariah; if you are exchanging gold for gold, the weight on both sides have to be equal. Therefore, if you are exchanging 100 grams of your “old” gold jewelry for 120 grams of “new” gold jewelry, it will not be permissible to exchange as that constitutes Riba (interest). It will be permissible for you with the jeweler only if the weight of the new jewelry is equivalent to the old one.\n\nالاختيار لتعليل المختار -)ج 1 / ص 15(\n\nوهو بيع جنس الأثمان بعضه ببعض، ويستوي في ذلك مضروبهما ومصوغهما وتبرهما، فإن باع فضةً بفضة أو ذهباً بذهب لم يجز إلا مثلاً بمثل يداً بيد، ولا اعتبار بالصياغة والجودة، فإن باعها مجازفةً ثم عرف التساوي في المجلس جاز وإلا فلا\n\n \n\nZakaat will only become necessary on the jewelry if the gold content weighs 87, 48 grams or more and one lunar passes upon the jewelry.\n\nQurbaani will become necessary upon a person if he/she owns 87,48g of gold or 612,35g of silver or the equivalent value in cash on the days of Eidul Adha. It is not necessary for one year to pass on the money for Qurabaani to be wajib(Hidaayah 3/443-444).\n\n2.It is not necessary to take a bath if droppings of a crow fall on ones clothes. It will be necessary to wash of that part of the clothes where the impurities have fallen (Tahtaawi Page 156).\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
