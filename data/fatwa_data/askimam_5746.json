  "question": "Can women wear jeans and a jacket with hijab? or skirts with a small slit in the back?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe word, 'Hijaab', in USA is generally understood to be a head covering. If\nso, it is not permissible for a female to only wear jeans and jacket in the\npresence of Ghayr Mahrams (males with whom marriage is not prohibited) as\nthose garments reveal the form and shape of a woman.\n\nA female must conceal her form and shape by wearing loose and unattractive\ngarments in front of Ghayr Mahrams.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
