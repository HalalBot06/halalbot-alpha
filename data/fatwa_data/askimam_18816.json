  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. Many of Bangladeshi people keep their money in Islamic Bank because they claim that interest raises from this bank is halal. My question is this interest money really halal?\n\n2. From your question-answer site I have known that eating shrimp is not permissible for Hanafi madhab. In , general people treat the shrimp as fish. As it is known as fish, so, one of our Bangladeshi Mufti says that it is permissible for Hanafi madhab too. Is it true?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\n1) In principle interest money is harām. However, we can not comment on any specific Bank without viewing their contract.\n\n2) ῾Ulamā have a difference of opinion with regards to the permissibility of consuming shrimps. Some ῾Ulamā regard it to be permissible whilst the other ῾Ulamā hold a view to the contrary. Therefore, abstaining from it will be considered as an act of precaution.\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl. Abduz Zaman,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
