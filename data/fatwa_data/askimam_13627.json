  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have intestinal problem, a patient of ulcerative collitis. My problm is that I have gases always & can't continue even four rakaat of Salah. It becomes worse with different kinds of movements e.g. prostrating (Sajood).\n \nWe go for Tarawiah & Qiyam Al-Lail to our campus mosque where therei s no arrangement for Wadu for ladies. I am continuing my prayers as such because my husband told me that since it is due to disease there is no problem for me going to mosque & praying there.\n \nI don't want to miss my prayers especially night prayers. So please advise me whether this way is correct.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYes, you are a Mazoor. You may continue with your Salaat even in this state.\n\nIncidentally, our advice to you is to avoid attending the Musjid for Salaat. In the words of the Hadith, 'The best Salaat of a woman is in the most inner recess of her home.'\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nfor: FATWA DEPT."
