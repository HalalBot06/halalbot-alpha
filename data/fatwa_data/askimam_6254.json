  "question": "Tafseers are really long and at the speed that I read I canâ€™t finish the Quran in half a year. So would you suggest that I do both qirat of Quran and read tafseer daily?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. I read in the book Fazail e Amaal that it is the haq of the Quran to be read twice in a year. I usually read tafseer with the ayahs and translation everyday as much as I can. Tafseers are really long and at the speed that I read I can?t finish the Quran in half a year. So would you suggest that I do both qirat of Quran and read tafseer daily? Does reading tafseer of Quran along with the ayah in Arabic replace doing the qirat of Quran? 2. Is Tafseer Ibn Katheer a good and reliable tafseer to read for Hanafis (any other madthab too)? Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. At the very outset, it should be borne in mind that the Tilaawat\n(recitation) and the studying of the Tafseer under a qualified tutor should\nbe taken individually. Hence, one should set aside sometime of the day apart\nfrom the time that is allotted for Tafseer to recite the Qur'aan.\n2. Tafseer ibn Katheer is a reliable and authentic Tafseer.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
