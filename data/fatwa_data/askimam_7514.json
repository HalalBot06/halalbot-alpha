Begin with the Name of Allah\n2. Make your intention (any language)\n3. To wash hands up to the wrists\n4. To wash off all impurities\n5. To wash the private parts even if no impurities maybe visible 6. Make a complete Wudhu 7. To wash the head 8. Pour water over the entire body thrice 9. Pour water over the right shoulder then the left shoulder 10. Rub the body 11. Keep in mind that you must make sure that the entire body is wet 12. Once you have completed make sure to wash the feet to ensure no impurities are left from the pouring.\n\nAs for the question of taking a bath naked this is permissible as long as you are not able to be seen by others. If not, you need to wear at least a loin cloth to cover that which is below your naval to your knees.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
