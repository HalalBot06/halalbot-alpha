  "question": "I dont want to keep a beard",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am a young Muslim. I fear Allah and want to have a beard. My Parents oppose me and I am confused, if I can oppose them in this. I fear Allah, lest He should hold me responsible for any of these acts (Shaving or disobeying parents).\n\nAlso my father (as told to me) fell ill, because I did not obey him at first. He stays in KSA, and I am in India. What do you say I should do?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIslam teaches us to have the highest amount of respect for our parents.  Allah Ta’ala says in the Qur’an:\n\nوَقَضَى رَبُّكَ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوا إِلَّا إِيَّاهُ وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا إِمَّا يَبْلُغَنَّ عِنْدَكَ الْكِبَرَ أَحَدُهُمَا أَوْ كِلَاهُمَا فَلَا تَقُلْ لَهُمَا أُفٍّ وَلَا تَنْهَرْهُمَا وَقُلْ لَهُمَا قَوْلًا كَرِيمًا . وَاخْفِضْ لَهُمَا جَنَاحَ الذُّلِّ مِنَ الرَّحْمَةِ وَقُلْ رَبِّ ارْحَمْهُمَا كَمَا رَبَّيَانِي صَغِيرًا (17– 23)\n\nYour Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and do good to parents.  If any of them or both of them reach old age, do not say to them: uff (a word or expression of anger or contempt) and do not scold them, and address them with respectful words. (17-27)\n\nIt is clear from the above ayah that the status of parents in the eyes of Shari’a is after the rights of Allah.  To please the parents and keep them happy is a virtuous deed while disobeying them or causing any discomfort to them is a grave sin.\n\nTherefore, one should try his utmost to please the parents and keep them happy.\n\nHowever, when there is a clash between the commandments of Allah and the pleasure of the parents, then the commandments of Allah will have to be fulfilled. It is mentioned in a hadith:\n\nعلى عن النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم قال لا طاعة لمخلوق فى معصية الله عز وجل\n\nAli (Radhiyallahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) said, “There is no obedience to creation in the disobedience of Allah”. (Ahmad)\n\nTo keep a beard is wajib.  A person who shaves or trims his beard is considered a fasiq. Try to win your parents favor through other means.  Inshallah, by doing khidmat of the parent and being obedient in other aspects, they will over look the aspect of beard and accept it over time.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
