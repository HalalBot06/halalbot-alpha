  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nthis question is about inheritance,\n\nMy grandma passed away in 1999.  She has left a property. She has 3 daughters alive and one dead, 4 sons alive and one dead. her another son died after 6 years and so she has only 3 daughters and 3 sons alive at the moment. \n\nI would like to know how to divide her property as the issue is going worse. \n\nmy Grandma has not made any will but has verbally told that it should go to one son.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nWe have been advised that the original deceased was survived by the following relatives only:\n\nFive sons (two predeceased) four daughters (one predeceased).\n\nBased upon the information provided in the query, it is unclear when the respective sons and daughter passed away. If all the sons and daughter passed away after their mother, all of the children will inherit and the share of the deceased sons and daughter will make up part of their respective estates and will be distributed according to the Islamic laws of succession.\n\nEach son will receive two shares and each daughter will receive one share. In the above scenario, the estate will be divided into 14 shares and then divided among the inheritors.\n\nIf any of the sons or daughter passed away before the mother, that son or daughter will not inherit and neither will their respective heirs. Thus, the above distribution will be altered accordingly with the same ratio of 2 shares per son and 1 share per daughter.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
