It is incorrect for a Sayed girl to marry a non-Sayed boy without the consent of her guardian. The Nikah would be invalid. We suggest you mend your ways and make a formal proposal to the girl?s guardian.\n\n2. Perform two Rakaats of Nafl Salaat and thereafter make Du?aa. Beg Allah Ta?ala to remove this evil habits from you and to grant you safety from all calamities.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
