  "question": "Is it permissible to drink Kava?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a question 1) if it is permisable to drink Kava?   I am currecntly suffering from stress, generalized anxiety, and mild depression.  My muslim doctor has me on prescription medication for anxiety (Lexapro) but I do not wish to take those due to side effects, and two it is also not helping me with my insomnia. \n\nIn additon the plant seems to help with arthritis, and also with menstural cramps. \n\nI have been doing some research on the internet and have learned that a natural plant called Kava is helpful in treating insomnia, and also for anxiety.  However I do not know if it is permissable in Islam or not. This is not an alcohol, so in that sense it is permissable. But on the other hand this plant drink  does cause mild euophoria as stated below.\n\nThese effects of drinking kava, in order of sensation, are slight tongue and lip numbing caused by the contraction of the blood vessels in these areas (the lips and skin surrounding may appear unusually pale); mildly talkative and euphoric behavior; anxiolytic (calming) effects, sense of well-being, clear thinking; and relaxed muscles. Sleep is often restful and there are pronounced periods of sleepiness correlating to the amount and potency of Kava consumed. When drunk to excess, Kava can cause vomiting and a feeling of nausea that will subside usually by the end of the day after consumption. In Vanuatu, drinking strong kava is normally followed by a hot meal or tea. Meals consumed along with kava traditionally follow some time after the beverage so that the psychoactives are absorbed into the bloodstream more quickly.\n\nThe full article can be found at this link on wikipedia:\n\ni would greatly appreciate your help on this matter.\n\nWaSalam.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is permissible to drink Kava.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
