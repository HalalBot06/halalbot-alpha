Or better he would avoid and pray later making new jamaat?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe Salaat of the Haafiz will be valid in both instances.\n\nEvery effort should be made that the Imaam adheres to the Shari’ah even in his appearance, beard and attire, etc.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
