  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs there any dua I can read to cursed bush, tony blair and his allies. I hope ALLAH's wrath will soon be upon them.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nOur suggestion to you is that instead of making du’aa for their destruction, you make du’aa that Allah guide them. Allah mentions in the Qur’aan, ‘We have not sent you but as a mercy unto mankind.’ (Anbiyaa Aayat107)\n\nNabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] came as a source of mercy to mankind and desired guidance even for his enemies. If they get hidaayat, then Alhamdulillah, one more person will be saved from the punishment of Allah and if they don’t get hidaayat, they will receive what is due to them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
