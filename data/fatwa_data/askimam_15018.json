  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMufti Saab, When two people are doing jamat how should the setup be. Some say they should stand together pointing to the hadith found in Fazail- Amal where the prophet was praying with the Sahabha and he pulled him forward etc. Yet i've been told to pray with the Imam a footstep ahead? What is the correct way and is there other hadith supporting it?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nWhen two people are performing Salah, the Imam should be in front of the follower (Muqtadi).\n\nThe Muqtadi’s toes should be in line with the Imam’s heels.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
