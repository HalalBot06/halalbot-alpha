  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam Mufti Saheb, 1>one of my brothers, had a dream in which he saw that I was getting married and he mentioned that it was a serious dream n very clear. Even though we know each other on internet, but have never seen each other, but he said that he had a strong feeling that the bride was me. Can u plz interpret for what it means? 2>Is it allowed for women to chat on net and if she finds a suitable person as a groom, so can she chat on net with the person inorder to know more details about him, so that if she is sure, then she can tell her parents about it so that they can fix their marriage? Like, if I get a proposal from a man on net and while I chatted for a long time, and if I find that the person meets the requirements which I was looking for in my spouse..so is this allowed..just inorder to find a spouse by ourselves?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The dream in reference has no significance.%0D%0A2. There are two fundamental aspects in choosing a marriage partner, a) The%0D%0Aoutward appearance, b) The ideology and character of the person.%0D%0AGenerally, as well as naturally, the outward appearance of a person is given%0D%0Aprominence before considering the ideology and character of the person.%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) also encouraged the boy and girl to%0D%0Asee one another for the purpose of marriage. (Mishkaat). It is, therefore,%0D%0Aadvisable to first choose one's prospective marriage partner and thereafter%0D%0Aenquire about his%2Fher ideology and character through avenues permissible in%0D%0AShari'ah, for example, friends, associates and family members. Shari'ah also%0D%0Aemphasizes one making Mashwara (consult) and make Istikhaara (seek Divine%0D%0AGuidance) before deciding. How much can one achieve by talking to the boy or%0D%0Agirl directly to determine his%2Fher character and ideology?%0D%0ASurely, the boy and girl will be as impressive as possible to pass the test.%0D%0AThat is not the normal conduct of the person which will be expressed in his%0D%0Aday to day life. There are many negative factors, if the procedure is%0D%0Areversed, and prominence is given to communicating with the person, to%0D%0Adetermine his character and ideology.%0D%0Aa) Can the person you are chatting with be trusted? There are many incidents%0D%0Aof chatting in the context of marriage but have led to illicit and immoral%0D%0Arelationships. Many people, especially, women have been misled and abused.%0D%0Ab) If the boy and girl consider themselves compatible in ideology and%0D%0Acharacter but disapprove one another's outward appearance, that will lead to%0D%0Agrief and agony as the communication was in the context of marriage. The%0D%0Amomentum has been built and now it's against the expectations of one or both%0D%0Aparties.%0D%0A%0D%0ALife is too dear to tread on unwarranted risk and thin ice. One should%0D%0Aexercise precaution in every aspect of life.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
