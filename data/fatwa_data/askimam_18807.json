  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a 33 years old woman. I lost my father at my very early life. After that my elder brother took care of us (me, my mother and another elder brother). Unfortunately he died when I was the student of the university. After that one of my cousin and my elder sisters help us for my study and for our living expenses. After completing my graduation I joined as a teacher in my university. I wear borkha (hijab) opening the face, hand and foot. I have male colleagues and also male students. But I always try to talk to them keeping in mind the rules of Islam. \n\n\n\n\n \n\nWe are six sisters, one brother and I am the youngest one. My mother also passed away. My sisters are poor and my brother did not get any job although he graduated from university. Now I have to take care of my brother and sometimes my sisters too. I should have to pay the money of my cousin that he gave us during my study and later on during my marriage.\n\n \n\nI know that normally woman is not permitted for a job. My situation is quite different. I am married and my husband has a job. But it is true that my husband’s family agreed to make this relationship only for my job.\n\n \n\nConsidering the above situation, am I permitted to continue my job? I loss all of my energy and feel unhappy when I think about the situation after death. Is Allah forgive me?\n\n \n\nThis is very much personal issue. I humbly request you not to open this matter to others. I would be thankful to you if you kindly reply to this question.\n\n \n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIn principle, a woman should not leave her home to work except in the event of a dire necessity. If she has to leave her house to teach, then she should leave in full Hijāb. She should not teach male (adult) students, neither should she interact with other males unnecessarily.\n\n \n\nIn your case, it is compulsory for you to cover your face also when leaving the home. If your husband is working then there is no need for you to work. Adhere strictly to the laws of shari’a. Allah jalla jalāluhu will provide you the sustenance from the sources which you would never expect.\n\n \n\nWhoever fears Allāh - Allāh will create for him a way of deliverance. And will provide him sustenance from a place he had never expected; and whoever relies on Allāh – then Allāh is Sufficient for him; indeed Allāh will accomplish His command; indeed Allāh has set a proper measure for all things. [1]\n\n \n\n \n\nHowever, if you are still compelled to go out and work, then you should try to confine your services to females only. If you are forced to teach and communicate with males then you will be excused. However, you should neither be in isolation with any strange male nor interact needlessly. If you think you are not strong enough to control your carnal self and strictly adhere to the laws of Hijāb, it will not be permissible for you to work amongst males.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl. Abdur Rahman Shareef,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n\n(2010-07-13)\n\n[1] سورة الطلاق  (آية 3,2)"
