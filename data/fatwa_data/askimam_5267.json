  "answer": "QUESTION\nI've asked this question once before, but did not receive a response.... 1)What are the fardh, sunnah and the nafl of salaat? 2) in all the five salaats, which sunnah are considered compulsory to offer? (the omitting of which is a sin?). 3) Can you please give the surah and dua read when you sit in the 2nd and 4th rakat for Tashud (especially in the 4th, after you raise your finger and put it back down). 4) I once swore falsely on the Quran (because I was scared of my mother's anger). My reasoning was: Allah will forgive me before my mother ever will. What should I do to repent? Is this sin forgivable? Jazak'Allah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Kindly refer below.%0D%0A2.
