  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease provide the details that are available about him.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Arabic word, 'al-Khaadir' means green and thus, al-Khizar which is\nderived from al-Khadir means the green one.\n\nIt is narrated by Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that Nabi (Sallallaahu\nAlayhi Wasallam) said, 'Al-Khidhr was named because he sat on a barren land\nand it turned green.' (Bukhari).\n\nSome Ulama are of the opinion that Khidhr (Alayhis salaam) was a prophet but\nthe opinion of most of the Ulama was that he is a pious servant of Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
