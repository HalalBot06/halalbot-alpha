  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamu alaykum\n\nMufti Sahib:\n\nCould you please provide a detailed explanation of the verse in the Burda, which the Salafis accuse of being shirk, that states:\n\n- “wa min `ulumika `ilma al lawhi wal qalam”\n\nIt seems that according to many of the reliable commentaries that this means the Prophet (pbuh) had *all* the knowledge of the Tablet and the Pen.\n\nShaykh al Islam Ibn Hajar Haytami states:\n\n- “[…] And the sense in which knowledge of the Tablet and the Pen is part of some of his sciences, upon him blessings and peace, is that on the night of Isra', Allah Most High showed him everything that is in the Preserved Tablet and added to that other types of knowledge, such as the secrets which pertain to His Essence and Attributes, may He be exalted.” (al `Umda fi Sharh al Burda)\n\nSimilarly, Mulla `Ali Qari states in his commentary:\n\n- “[…] It was also said that Allah Most High showed him, upon him blessings and peace, what the Pen had written in the Preserved Tablet, which is the knowledge of the first and the last, and this is the preponderant explanation (wa-huwa al-az.har) […] the science of the Tablet and the Pen are only a few lines (sut.ur) among the lines of his knowledge and a mere river from the seas of his knowledge….” (al-Zubda fi Sharh al Burda)\n\nAlso, the great Shafi`I and Ash`ari Shaykh al Azhar, Imam Bajuri, said in his commentary:\n\n- “'Wa-min' in his saying 'wa-min `ulumika' is for tab`eed also [...] meaning the informations Allah Most High showed him, for He, Most High, showed him the sciences of the first and the last…” (sharh al Burda)\n\nShaykh Zadah said in his commentary:\n\n- “\"It may be that Allah Most High showed him, upon him blessings and peace, all that is in the Tablet, and increased him on top of that also, because the Tablet and the Pen are created, so what is in them has a limit, and it is possible for the limited to encompass thelimited.” (fil Hashiyah al Burdah\n\nDo you agree with the above? If not, what si the proper explanation and is it a matter of difference whether the Prophet had all the knowledge of the Tablet and Pen.\n\nJazakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nMuhtaram Brother in Islam\n\n \n\n \n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\n \n\n \n\nNabi Sallallahu Alaihi Wa Sallam being the final and most beloved prophet to Allah Ta'ala,enjoyed many divine prerogative's which other prophets did not.One of these prerogative was the extensive knowledge which Nabi llallahu Alaihi Wasallam possessed. However, one should keep in mind that the fundamental difference between the knowledge of Allah Ta'ala and the knowledge of the prophets (Alaihimus salaam) is that the knowledge of Allah Ta'ala encompasses everything, even the minutest detail and is unlimited.  On the other hand the knowledge of the prophets does not encompass everything nor is their knowledge unlimited, rather their knowledge is limited and restricted despite it being extensive and vast.\n\n \n\nAlso the knowledge of Allah Ta'ala is self attained and the knowledge of the prophets is actually a gift from Allah Ta'ala and not something which they acquired themselves.\n\n \n\nIt is our belief that Allah Ta'ala had blessed Nabi Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam with the knowledge of the tablet and pen as stated in the couplet of the burdah and supported by the reliable commentaries you have quoted.  This, however does not mean that Nabi  Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam possessed the knowledge of everything.  Hence, holding the belief that Nabi Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam was granted the knowledge of the tablet and pen is not tantamount to shirk as the ignorant salafi's claim.\n\n \n\nAnother explanation to the couplet of the burdah and texts in its supportive commentaries is that Nabi Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam was granted the brief knowledge of the tablet and pen and not the detailed knowledge.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best.\n\n \n\nMoulana Suhail Tar Mohammed\n\n \n\nStudent: Darul Ifta\n\n \n\n \n\nChecked and approved:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
