  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have heard a hadith, the close meaning of which is ?Close to qayamah the non believers will ask for a person among Muslims, the Muslims will not give that person to the non believers. There will be a war, 1/3 rd of Muslims will be martyred, 1/3 rd will flee and then Allah?s help will be with the last one third?.? Please provide the complete text of this hadith and comment on the authenticity of this hadith. --- Jazakallah Hu Fidarayeen Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe hadith in reference is quoted by Abu Hurairah (RA). The Romans will\napproach A'maaq, a place around Medina Munawwara. They will demand from the\nMuslims to allow them access to their Muslim prisoners. (An endeavour to\ndivide the Muslims). That will not be acceptable to the Muslims and\nthereafter a huge war will take place.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
