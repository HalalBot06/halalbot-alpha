  "question": "Are muslims suppose to believe in chain letters?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI received a chain letter saying that the watchman (Sheik Ahmed) of the Prophet Mohammeds Mosque (PBUH) had a dream about the Prophet in his dream (PBUH). Sheik Ahmed has distributed the description of the letter to other muslims and it says in there that if u do not send it to 20 more Muslim or one will die within 9 days.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWARNING - BEWARE\nVarious letters and pamphlets have surfaced all over the country bearing the\nname of one 'Sheikh Ahmadu'. Some have the following titles:\n\n'Dream in Madinah', 'Letter from Makkah', 'Get luck in Seven days', 'Rewards\nof photocopying this letter', 'Sheikh Ahmadu'.\n\nOur investigations have confirmed that there is no such person as Sheikh\nAhmadu. We have also ascertained that these letters originate from certain\nChristian organisations. The purpose of these letters is to confuse and\nmisdirect Muslims and engage them in activities that would waste both their\ntime and money.\n\nMUSLIMS ARE URGED THAT SHOULD THEY ENCOUNTER THESE PAMPHLETS/LETTER THEY\nSHOULD IMMEDIATELY DISREGARD AND DESTROY THEM."
