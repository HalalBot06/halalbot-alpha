  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ncan a person make  a wasiyyay for his grandchildren, even though his children are alive. Can he exclude some grandchildren because they are baaligh already ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nIt is permissible for one to make Wassiya for his grandchildren only if they are not his heirs at the time of his death. If his children are alive at the time of his death, the grandchildren will not inherit. A bequest may be made on favor of some or all the grandchildren.  (Ahsan ul-Fatawa, 9/292, Saeed)\n\n \n\nما روي عن أبي قلابة رضي الله عنه أنه عليهالصلاة والسلام قال لا وصية لوارث والكتاب العزيز قد ينسخ بالسنة\n(بدائع الصنائع، 6/423، ديوبند)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\nMl.
