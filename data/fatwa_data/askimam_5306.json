  "question": "Assalamoalaikum dear mufti sahab? can i work on a video conferencing system?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamoalaikum dear mufti sahab! I have done my Graduation in Computers. I am searching for a job. As i am a foreigner in Malaysia, it seems hard to find a suitable and legal job. I might get an opportunity to work in a Budhist's company. He may hire me on a contract for a year or so. The problem is that, for some time, he will assign me to work for a video conferencing system, which is haram(if i am not wrong). is it permissible for me to join the company, though i will be working on the system for a little while. What if i request the boss not to assign me on the system but he doesnt agrees?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, photography is prohibited in Shari'ah and, therefore, it will\nbe prohibited to undertake the video contract. If you are desperate and do\nnot have any employment, you may accept the video contract until you find an\nalternative employment.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
