  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am a female from Algeria and married in a mosque in london to a US Citizen. I needed money so married him even though I knew he was non-muslim. He has now divorced me and threatens to tell everyone in Algeria I married a seikh if I ask him for money. Our daughter is due to get married in Algeria to a muslim will this effect her and how will my husband telling people he's a seik affect me?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\n \n\nWe make dua that Allah Ta’ala remove your difficulties and hardships, Ameen.\n\nIt is not permissible for a muslim woman to marry a non muslim man. The marriage is invalid. You were never his wife according to Shariah. The divorce he has issued is insignificant. It does not mean anything. Your relationship with him was a sinful one.\n\nSister, you should distance yourself from this person. Do not have anything to do with him. Do not even ask him for money. You made a mistake. Make Taubah and ask Allah to forgive you. Do not submit to the threats of the person. He may just “use” you in lieu of some money and dump you again. You don’t need to subject yourself to such abuse and indignity.\n\nTurn to Allah and ask Allah to fulil your needs and to protect you from the evils of the person. If Allah decrees to protect you and help you, no one can harm you.\n\nYou should educate yourself on Shariah. Perform Salah and recite the Quran daily. This attitude will bring peace and contentment in your life.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
