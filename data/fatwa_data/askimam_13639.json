  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nFor home ta'lim, we read Fadail-e-a'mal. Can we also read Fadail-e-sadaqat, Muntakhab hadith, Ryad-us-Saleheen, Hayatus Sahaba, Seeratun Nabi (SM) by Allama Shibly Nomani? One brother said that talim won't be fulfiled without the reading from Fadail e Amal. Actually we used to read from Muntakhab hadith after salatul fajar, and in the eveing we used to read Fadail e amal and other books if time permitted. Is this ok to do? Since Muntakhab hadith doesn't have much explanation, it is easier for us to read it quickly after Fajar salat. After maghrib/isha, we have some time and we can read other books. Also is this a must that we have to read Fadail e amal daily in the ta'lim?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is not necessary to confine yourselves with reading Fadhaail-e-Aamaal. You may also read Muntakhab Ahaadith and other reliable books.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
