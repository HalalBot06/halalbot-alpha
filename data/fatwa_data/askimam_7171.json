  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a young 19 year old male. I wanted to ask you about a certain incident and what effect it had on my fast in the month of Ramadan. I recently had a dream just before noon that I was having sexual relation with a female. A female whom I could not recognize because her face was not shown. We had intercourse and I ejaculated in my dream. When I woke up I realized I ejaculated in reality as well. I am afraid that I may have broke my fast because of this. But since This was involuntary and occurred during the unconscious it may not have been my fault. I am in need for some advice.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe fast was valid. A wet dream does not invalidate the fast.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
