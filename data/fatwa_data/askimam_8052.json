  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease provide me some duas for Isaal-e Sawaab to Marhoom. (specially for parents) Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIsaal-e-Sawaab (to perform a virtuous act and grant the reward to any person, alive or deceased) is permissible.\n\nOn numerous occasions, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised the Sahaaba (Radhiyallaahu Anhum) to give charity on behalf of the deceased. One specific incident is of Hadhrat Abu Talha (Radhiallaahy Anhu) when the Aayat, ?You cannot attain virtue until your spend what is beloved to you?? (Nisaa 4). Abu Talha gave his most valuable well and garden, Bi?r Haa as charity on behalf of his deceased mother. In fact, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) slaughtered 100 sheep during his farewell Hajj and made intention for himself and all those (alive, deceased and to come) who bring faith on his prophethood.
