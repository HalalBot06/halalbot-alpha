  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it permissible to give away food, candy etc, to others if it contains haraam ingredients? If one received this as gift? Can you exchange it? Can one buy something that is haraam, to give away as a gift or charity, to a Non-Muslim? If someone is working for you, and is eating their (haraam) lunch in your house, should you tell them to eat it outside?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In principle, anything that contains Haraam (impure) ingredients cannot be consumed or given to anyone. That includes non-Muslims and animals.\n\n2. To object to a non-Muslim eating his lunch in your house is against the good character of a Muslim.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
