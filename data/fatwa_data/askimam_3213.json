  "question": "Which of the 73 factions this Ummah of our Prophet (s.a.w) will go to Jannah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have heard thru many scholars that the faction which follows the Quran and the rasool (saw) only will go to Jannah. Also are Hanafi, Shafa'ee, Hanbali and Maaliki considered different factions. Also where should the hands be placed when performing salah? on the chest or on top of the navel? If they four above schools of thoughs were teachers and students of each other then why do they have a difference in opinion and what is the correct way to follow? May Allah reward\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n[1] No, the four madhabs are not different sects. Rather, they are all part of Ahl as Sunnah wal Jama'aah.\n\nWhile all four madhabs are correct, each person needs to to stick to one madhab. For further details, see Ask Imam #14925\n\nThe Companions of the Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) also had differences of opinion about matters based on independent reasoning [ijtihad]. However, these differences were based on a natural outcome of independent reasoning – and not out of any personal desires or motivation.\n\nLikewise, the mujtahids of each madhab also have differences of opinion (in matters where independent reasoning can be exercised) because they have attained that required level of expertise and caliber to derive rulings.\n\nSince laymen do not have the capability to differentiate between the principles and evidences of the mujtahids, they are necessarily required to follow one madhab as mentioned earlier. However, whichever of these four madhabs, one follows, he will be amongst the saved sect, the Ahl as Sunnah wal Jama'aah.\n\n[2] For details regarding the 73 sects and what they actually refer to, please see Ask Imam # 27864\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
