  "answer": "QUESTION\ndo Prophets leave inheritence? secondly, Did dawood (as) really leave 1000 horses for Sulayman (as) in inheritence as reported by Tafseer Ruh al Ma'ani Part 23 Surah Sad page 183, Tafseer Gharab al Qur'an Part 23, Surah Sad page 90, Tafseer Khazan Part 23, Volume 6 page 45, Tafseer Kashaf Volume 2 page 284, Hayat al Haywaan page 314, Dhikr al Jawad, Tafseer Mazhari Volume 8 page 145 Surah Sad? if Prophets do not inherit, then how did Sulayman (as) get 1000 horses in inheritence?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nNabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘We, i.e. the Anbiyaa, do not leave any inheritance. We leave Sadaqah (charity).’ (Bukhari Hadith6728)\n\nIn another Hadith, Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said that the ‘Ulama are inheritors of the Anbiyaa and the inheritance of the Prophets is not wealth but it is ilm (knowledge).’ (Mishkaat pg.34; Qadeemi)\n\nIn the light of the above 2 Ahaadith, it is clear that the Prophets do not leave any worldly possessions in inheritance. The view that Dawood (alayhimus salaam) left 1000 horses in inheritance for Sulaymaan (alayhimus salaam) is incorrect due to the above Hadith. (Tafseer Mazhari; Surah Sa’ad Aayat31)\n\nSulaymaan (alayhimus salaam) did not inherit the horses, but he was made the administrator of these horses (which was to be used in Jihaad). (Ibid)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
