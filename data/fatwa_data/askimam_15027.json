  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n** URGENT - I posted this twice already and still awaiting an answer **\n\nMy question was not answered properly in my previous post. Please also refer to your fatwa # 10700 dated Jan 20, 2004 as my question is related to the answer you provided in that fatwa.\n\n1. I am suffering from very strong waswasaa and your clear answer will help me overcome my doubts. Can you please tell me CLEARLY that what is the minimum level of voice that will cause divorce to take effect? If a person who is suffering from strong waswasa and uncontrollable thoughts about divorce where these thoughts force him to say divorce statements to himself and due to these strong thoughts he is uttering divorce statements ONLY to himself (with no intention to actually utter divorce) either in whispers (i.e. soft low voice) or muttering where his mouth is open and tongue and lips moves but statement is spoken/uttered in such a way (in such low voice) that his statement cannot be clearly understood even by a person standing next to him then will divorce take effect? So his voice or whisper was so low that no one will be able to understand what he said. Please clarify this issue.\n\n2. Does saying a statement of divorce in question form will cause divorce? If man says, \"Do you prefer to do such-and-such or rather be divorced?\" and if the lady replies \"I rather be divorced\" but then man DID NOT issue or utter divorce then will this situation cause divorce?\n\nJazzak Allah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n\nYour query has already been submitted and picked up for answer. The question will be answered shortly, Resubmitted query will be deleted."
