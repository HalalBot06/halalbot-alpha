  "question": "Reciting sura behind the imam: what is the difference with hanafi and other madhad? Sharia proofs?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn our mosjid, a brother who is of Malki madhab claimed that it is permissible to recite sura behind the imam in jamat in every rakat and he said the hanafi madhad is totally wrong to say that sura not to be recited (fateha, and a sura followed by) behind the imam while praying in Jamat. He also claimed there is NO hadith or sharia proof to justify the hanafi point of view. (1) Can you please provide us with the details of this ruling in hanafi regarding a person reciting surah while he is in a jamat in salat praying behind the imam? What is the ruling for Malki madhab? (2) What sharia proof is there in support of Hanafia point of view? Hadith? Practice of sahabah? Etc?? (3) What shria proof is there in support of the brothers view point that shurah should be recited although a Muslim is praying behind the imam in a jamat?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Hadhrat Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'The Imaam has been appointed for so that you can complete your Salaat with him. When he reads, keep silent.' (Tahawi)%0D%0A2. Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that they used to read%0D%0AQirata behind Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), then Nabi (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) said, 'You have confused me in the Qiraat.' (Ibid)%0D%0A3. Hadhrat Jaabir (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) said, 'That person who has an Imaam, the Qiraat of the%0D%0AImaam is sufficient for him.'%0D%0A4. Hadhrat Abdullah ibn Mas'ood (Radhiallaahu Anhu) said, 'That person who%0D%0Areads behind the Imaam, fill his mouth with sand.' (Ibid)%0D%0A5. Abdullah ibn Muqsim asked ibn Umar, Zaid ibn Thaabit and Jaabir%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhu) about Qiraat behind the Imaam. They all said, 'Don't%0D%0Aread any Qiraat behind the Imaam in Salaat.' (Ibid)%0D%0A6. Abi Jamrata said that, 'I asked ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that can I%0D%0Aread Qiraat while the Imaam is in front of me.' Ibn Abaas (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhu) replied, 'No.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Fatwa according to the abovementioned Sahaaba is that no Surah should be%0D%0Arecited behind the Imaam.%0D%0A%0D%0A'When the Qur'aan is being read, listen and keep silent so that the blessing%0D%0Aof Allah can be showered on you.' (Qur'aan). Mujaahid (RA) says that this%0D%0AAayat was revealed with regards to reading Qiraat behind the Imaam.%0D%0A%0D%0AAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, to read any Surah behind the Imaam is%0D%0AMakrooh-e-Tahrimi. A person will be liable for sin if he has to read any%0D%0ASurah behind the Imaam.%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom Imaam Maalik, three opinions have been narrated with regards to reading%0D%0AQiraat behind the Imaam in those Salaats which have loud Qiraat: a) Mubaah,%0D%0Ab) Mustahabb and, c) Makrooh.%0D%0A%0D%0AWith regards to those Salaats in which there is soft Qiraat, there are also%0D%0A3 views: a) Mubaah, b) Mustahabb and, c) Waajib.%0D%0AOnce Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) performed Fajr Salaat. Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) experienced some difficulty while reading.%0D%0AAfter completing the Salaat, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) faced the%0D%0ASahaab and said, 'Do you read behind your Imaam.' The Sahaaba replied, 'Yes'%0D%0A. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Don't do this except with Surah%0D%0AFaatiha, because there is no Salaat for that person who didn't read Surah%0D%0AFaatiha.'%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
