But she insists that she dont want to marry me as she will marry a person whome she loves.Please let me know what should i do. Should i tell my parents ? Or should i tell to her parents?Or is their any other solution.Please help me as i like and love her very much. Assalam alai kum\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMarriage is a major step in life and you should exercise precaution in\nchoosing your marriage partner. You may probably love the person because of\nher looks and appearance. That is only a superficial love, not real love.\n\nThose looks and appearances are only temporary. It is irresponsible to make\na choice to marry a person based only on superficial love, especially, in\nyour case when the girl indicates she does not love you. How would you live\nwith a person who don't love you? It is our advice you discuss with parents\nyour intention to marry and your inclination towards the girl and her\nresponse. Mashwara should be made on making a formal approach or not. If the\nresponse is negative, you should accept that and look elsewhere.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
