  "question": "friend got married (nikah ceremony) in Pakistan this year July. Now she has returned home and is having another 'wedding ceremony' without nikah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy best friend got married (nikah ceremony) in Pakistan this year July. Now she has returned home and is having another 'wedding ceremony' without nikah, and is spending thousands of pounds, and claiming that this is her 'wedding'. She has even sent out wedding invitations for her 'wedding' and treating her husband like she isnt married to him (i.e. not allowed to be in same room, or see each other before the 'wedding'). She is also planning on doing music and put the wedding on video. Is this permissible and is it permissible for me to attend such a 'wedding'? Salam Sister Khadijah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nJazakallah for writing to the institute and please do forgive me for the delay in replying to your mail.\n\nIt appears that your friend has some misguided \"fairy tale\" ideas of what a wedding is all about and what marriage means in Islam. Every bride should desire that Allah Ta'ala showers His choicest blessings and Rahmah on her marriage and not His wrath and anger. Be that as it may, you seem to appreciate that music, videos and free mixing between non mahram men and women is unacceptable in Islam. 'The seeratul mustaqueem' is what you seek from Allah Ta'ala so I suggest that you take the route which pleases Allah Ta'ala and not human beings.\n\nMay Allah Ta'ala grant all of us the tawfeeq to obey His commandments and stay away from evil, ameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nSister Fadila\nSOCIAL DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
