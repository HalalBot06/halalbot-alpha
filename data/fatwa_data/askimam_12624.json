  "question": "Is not cutting the nails as described in Ta’leemul Haq bid’ah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs not cutting the nails as described in Ta?leemul Haq bid?ah? There is absolutely no evidence for the order of cutting the nails (i.e. from the index finger of the right hand to the small finger and the small finger of the left hand to the left thumb and finally the right thumb) as described in Ta?leemul Haq and it was given the status of mustahabb in the book ? introducing this act in deen without any daleel (Qur?an, Sunnah, Ijma?, Qiyas or actions of Sahabah, Tabi?een or Tabi?ee Tabi?een). How do the Deobandis justify their view? Jazakumullahukhair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA reputable Muhaddith, Allamah Nawawi (R.A) who is also the commentator of Sahihul Muslim, which is one of the most authentic books of Hadith and an illustrious scholar Imam Ghazaali (R.A) have regarded the clipping of nails in sequence as Mustahab. It also seems that whatever is mentioned in Ta?limul Haqq has also originated from the view held by Allamah Nawawi and Imam Ghazaali (R.A).%0D%0A%0D%0AOn the other hand majority of the Ulamaa and Fuqahaa (Jurists) are of the view that it is not Mustahab to observe any particular sequence in clipping ones nails and whomsoever claims otherwise should present sufficient and authentic substantiation.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, Allamah Ibne Hajar ?Asqalani (R.A.A.), an illustrious and reputable scholar of Hadith and also the author of Fathul Baari, the commentary of the most authentic book of Hadith; Sahihul Bukhari, presents another interpretation in the light of Hadith to prove that cutting ones nails in sequence is at least recommended, if not Mustahab. He mentions the Hadith of Aisha (R.A.) in which she says that: ?Nabi (S.A.W.) liked to choose the right in his issues of Tahaarat (purity and cleanliness) and Tarajjul (combing his hair) and likewise in all his affairs.? From this Hadith we conclude that it is recommended (not Mustahab) to observe the sequence in clipping the nails and start from the right hand. Allamah Ibne Hajar (R.A.) also explains that to start clipping from the Musabbihah (better known as the Tashahhud finger (index finger) of the right hand is because of its virtue over the other fingers. As far as observing the sequence of the remaining fingers is concerned it is because they start from the right of the index finger and as mentioned by Aisha (R.A.), Nabi (S.A.W.) always preferred the right side. (Bukhari,Vol.2,Page.875, Fathul Bari,Vol.10,Page.345, Muslim,Vol.2,Page129, Raddul Muhtaar,Vol.5,Page.288, Al-Mughni Li Ibni Qudaamah,Vol.1,Page.118-119)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt should also be noted that in Ta?limul - Haqq the Author has not regarded the above mentioned order of clipping the nails as Mustahab. Rather he says: THE RECOMMENDED SEQUENCE TO BE FOLLOWED IN CLIPPING OF THE FINGER AND TOE NAILS. After going through Ta?limul - Haqq we conclude that it will be fallacious and unfair to say that by saying that it is ?recommended?, the author is referring to Istihbaab because on other occasions the author has used the word Mustahab where he is referring to Istihbaab. (Ta?limul - Haqq, Page 46 and 63, Revised 8th edition 1998) %0D%0A%0D%0AFinally, I would like to clarify that this issue of observing a certain order in clipping nails is not an issue erected and fabricated by Deobandis or the Ulamaa-e-Deoband, Rather it is a controversial issue since the noble era of the Muhadditheen and the Fuqahaa (Islamic Jurists). The Ulamaa-e-Deoband have merely mentioned and interpreted the views of the Muhadditheen and the Fuqahaa in the light of the Shari?ah. In conclusion the Deobandis have nothing to justify and neither are they apologetic of their view.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Ashraf%0D%0ADARUL IFTA ?
