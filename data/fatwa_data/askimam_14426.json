  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs an abortion permissible if the couple are on the verge of divorce(talaaq)?\n\nAssalaamu-Alaykum I am facing a very difficult situation in my life. A few years ago I married my cousin mainly due to pressure from my family. It was not something I wanted but in the end I accepted. Over time I began to suffer from depression and eventually I told my parents that I wanted to be separated from her. We had been separated for a year, though we kept contact via occasional telephone calls/text messages. Just under two months ago, her family visited our house and she came with them. Unfortunately we became intimate and now there is a chance that she may be pregnant. My feelings regarding being separated have not changed. I am very confused, and don’t know what to do. She will probably desire to keep the baby in order to try and convince me to stay with her – though I do not share this desire. My question is that, is an abortion permissible in this situation? And if so do she and I, both have to agree to it?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf your wife is conceived, it is not permissible to abort the foetus for the reasons cited by you.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
