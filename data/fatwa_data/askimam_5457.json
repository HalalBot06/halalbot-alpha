  "question": "I have 2 questions, the first regarding marriage; and the second, if you could recommend a credible website.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam Alaikum Respected Mufti Sahib. First, what can children do in order to get their parents blessings for their choice of marriage partner? Particularly, when Deen, ethnicity, age, education and such desired qualities are present in both potential partners - but parents are resisting due to certain hurtful and inappropriate comments made by one family towards the other. How can the other side overcome their anxieties about the issue, so that they may start a fresh discussion? Also, is there a website you can recommend for learning about Ahadith? Jazzak Allah Khair, and please make Dua' for us so that this issue may be resolved. Wa'Salaam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It may assist to suggest to the parents to make Istikhaara regarding the\nchoice of marriage partner. Istikhaara is seeking guidance from Allah Ta'\nala. No Muslim will refuse that. Keep the matter suspended until then. That\nmay be the first step to overcome the anxiety in the matter.\n2. We have included you in our Hadith-on-line programme.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
