  "question": "Is it permissible for a woman to lead prayer of a group of women in a gathering?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nJamaat salaat for men, the men pray behind one who leads them in prayer. Is this permissible for women in a women only gathering? I have heard of such happening and was wondering if it is permissable or not. Thank you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is Makrooh Tahrimi (serevely reprehensible) for a woman to lead the%0D%0ASalaat for a group of females. This is stated clearly in the books of Fiqh%0D%0A(see Tabyeenul Haqaaiq vol. 1 p. 13; Darrul Mukhtaar vol. 1 p. 528)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe reason for this severe Karaahat (reprehensibility) is the following%0D%0AHadith:%0D%0AIt is related from Hadhrat %C1aisha (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'There is no good in women performing%0D%0ASalaat with Jamaat except in a Masjid where the Salaat of the males is%0D%0Aperformed with Jamaat.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is reported from %C1li (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) that he said, 'A woman must not%0D%0Alead the Salaat.' Hence, it is incorrect for a woman to lead the Salaat and%0D%0Afor other females to follow. We find that this practice was not encouraged%0D%0A(that women make their own Jamaat) from the time of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam). If an incident or two can be found where this occurred, it%0D%0Awas an absolutely rare case which cannot be used to justify the procedure of%0D%0Aa woman leading the Salaat. We also cannot find any mention of this practice%0D%0Ataking place in the time of the Khulafaa-e-Rashideen. Instead, Hadhrat %C1li%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) clearly forbade women from leading the Salaat.%0D%0ATherefore, the Hanafi (jurists) have, on the basis of the above mentioned%0D%0AAhaadith, stated quite clearly that this practice is Makrooh-e-Tahrimi.%0D%0ASalaat is a means of earning the Mercy and blessings of Allah Ta%E3la. These%0D%0Atwo aspects therefore cannot be reconciled. Hence, women should totally%0D%0Adesist from it. They should perform their Salaat individually in as much%0D%0Aprivacy as possible, in the light of what has been mentioned in various%0D%0AAhaadith.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A"
