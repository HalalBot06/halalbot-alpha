  "question": "Can one perform zikr while taking a shower? How to perform a Nafl Ghusl (as compared to Fard Ghusl)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease keep in mind the bathrooms in the west include a toilet, but there is no ?dirt? around once flushed, plus the bathtub is curtained off when taking a shower.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The Fuqahaa have ruled that it is Makrooh for a person who is unclothed\nto speak. (Bazlul Majhood pg.4; Darul Imaan)\n2. The difference between Fardh bath and a Nafl bath is that in a Fardh\nbath, Allah Ta'ala orders in the Qur'aan with emphasis, 'If in the state of\nimpurity, purify yourself.' A person performing a Fardh bath should be made\ncautious that every part of the body is washed properly. If any part is left\ndry, this bath (Fardh) will be rendered incomplete. (al Fiqh al-Hanafiyya\nvol.1 pg.55; Beirut). However, in a Nafl bath, a person does not have to be\nso cautious if any part is left dry. The bath will be rendered complete.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
