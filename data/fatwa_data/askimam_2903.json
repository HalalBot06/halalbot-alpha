  "question": "At times of difficulty, is it really the Sunnah to hold “Yasin khatams” in the Masjid or any place?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAt times of difficulty, hardship, calamity, we want to know whether it really was part of the ?SUNNAT TAREEQAH? of Hazrat Muhammad Mustafa sallallahualyhiwasallam to invite people and hold Yasin khatams in the Masjid or any other place? If not, then we want to know what exactly is the ?SUNNAT? in such difficult times? If it is, please tell us where we can find it? We need to revive the REAL Sunnat of OUR AAQAA, so we need to know it, May Allah reward you!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlmighty Allah Ta'ala says, 'O you who believe! Seek assistance through%0D%0Apatience and Salaat.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIn view of the above Aayat, it was the noble habit of Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) to hasten to Salaat when faced with any major%0D%0Amatter. The Salaat referred to is commonly known as Salaatul Haajat (Salaat%0D%0Aof need). Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to focus his%0D%0Aattention towards Allah Ta'ala and engage in Du'aa.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Ahaadith and Seerah of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) are%0D%0Areplete with the abovementioned practices of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam). However, Shari'ah does not restrict one from doing anything more%0D%0Athan Salaat and Du'aa, for example, reciting Qur'aan. The recitation of%0D%0ASurah Yaaseen has an effect on fulfilling one's needs. Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Whosoever recites from Yaaseen in the%0D%0Abeginning of the day, Allah fulfils all his needs.'%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
