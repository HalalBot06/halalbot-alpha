  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaah: Qasr, Jahm: eg. if travelling by plane...salaah performed in the sitting position - should Salaah be reperformed when you reach your destination but as Qadah eg. Qasr? Please explain. Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhilst traveling in an aircraft, you should perform your Salaat on board. As\nfar as possible, try and stand and also face the Qiblah. There is a bit of\nopen space at the rear or front of the aircraft near the toilets or kitchen.\n\nHowever, where this is not possible, you may perform your Salaat whilst\nseated and face the Qiblah direction if possible or in whichever direction\npossible. It is best to repeat Salaat once you land. You will perform Qasr\nas Qadhaa if you performed it as Qasr on board.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
