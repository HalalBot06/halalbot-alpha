  "answer": "QUESTION\nThis is the one, in which Rasulullah describes his complete journey, meeting with the Prophets in the Heavens, and getting the reward of Salaah. (I believe this was narrated by Anas R.A.)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA DETAILED ACCOUNT OF MI'RAAJ IN SAHIH BUKHAARI%0D%0A%0D%0AIn Sahih Bukhaari, the incident of Mi'raaj has been narrated by Anas bin Maalik (Radiallahu anhu) in several places. In some places, he reports through Abu Zar, and at times through the medium of Maalik bin Sa'saa Ansaari (Radiallahu anhum).%0D%0A%0D%0AAnas (Radiallahu anhu) reports from Maalik Bin Sa'saa (Radiallahu anhu) that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, \"I was near the Ka'bah in a state of half%ADwakefulness. Three people came to me with a golden tray which was laden with wisdom and Imaan. They cut open my chest, washed it with the water of Zam Zam and filled it with wisdom and Imaan. Then, a white animal that was shorter than a mule and taller than a donkey was brought before me. This animal was the Buraaq.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AJOURNEYING INTO THE HEAVENS AND MEETING THE AMBIYAA THERE%0D%0A\"I set out with Jibraeel until we reached the lowest heaven. Jibraeel said to the keeper of the heaven, 'Open'. He asked, \"Who is with you?\" Jibraeel replied,' Muhammad,* \"'Has he been invited?\" he asked. Jibraeel (Alaihis salaam) replied , \"yes.\" So he welcomed me, opened the door and remarked, \"Your coming here is indeed very blessed.\" We went higher up, until we met Aadam (Alaihis salaam). When I greeted him, he said: \" Welcome to you, 0 son and Prophet. \" We then reached the second heaven and there too a similar discourse took place as at the time of entering the previous heavens. The door was opened and I found Eesa and Yahya (Alaihimas salaam) there and they both said, 'Welcome to you, 0 brother and Prophet.'%0D%0A%0D%0A?When we reached the third heaven, again the same questions and answers were exchanged as before. There, we found Yoosuf (Alaihis salaam). I greeted him and he said: \"Welcome to you, 0 brother and Prophet.\" We then ascended to the fourth heaven where a similar discussion took place. The door was then opened and we ascended further. There we found Idrees (Alaihis salaam).' I greeted him and he too welcomed me saying \"Welcome to you, 0 brother and Prophet.\" We then reached the fifth heaven where a similar dialogue took place as before. Then we ascended until we met Haroon (Ala ' ihis salaam). I greeted him and he said, \"Welcome to you, 0 brother and Prophet.\" Therefore we ascended to the sixth heaven where again the same questions and answers were exchanged as before. The gate was opened and we continued our ascent and found%0D%0A%0D%0AMoosa (Alaihis salaam) there. He also said, \"Welcome to you, 0 brother and Prophet.\" When 1 passed on, he started to cry. Someone asked him,\"What makes you weep?\" He replied, \"A young man has been sent after me and the people of his ummah who will enter Jannah, shall surpass, in excellence, the people of my ummah who will enter Jannah.\" In another narration, it is mentioned, \"The people of his ummah who will enter Jannah will outnumber those of my ummah.\"%0D%0A%0D%0A\"We then reached the seventh heaven and there, too, the same questions and answers were exchanged as before. The gates were opened and we went h igher up until we found Ibraheem (Alaihis salaam). I greeted him and he said, \"Welcome to you, 0 son and Prophet. \" (A point to note here is that Aadam (Alaihis salaam) and Ibraheem (Alaihis salaam) had welcomed nabi addressing him as \"son and Prophet\" since he was from their offspring, while the other Ambiyaa (Alaihimus salaam) had addressed him as, \"brother and Prophet.\")%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE BAITUL MA'MOOR AND THE SIDRATUL MUNTAHAA%0D%0A\"Thereafter, Al-Baitul Ma'moor was presented before me. I asked Jibraeel (Alaihis salaam) what it was and he replied, \"It is Al-Baitul Ma'moor wherein seventy thousand angels perform salaah daily. Once they come out, they never return.\" Then, the Sidratul Muntahaa was brought before me, and I saw its fruits which were like the earthen jars of Hajr and its leaves were like the ears of elephants.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"At the root of the Sidratul Muntahaa, I saw four rivers. Two were Baatin (concealed) and the other two were Zaahir (visible). When I asked Jibraeel (Alaihis salaam) concerning them, he told me that the two hidden rivers were the rivers of Jannah and the two visible rivers were the Euphrates and the Nile.\" (The river Euphrates%0D%0A%0D%0AFIFTY TIMES SALAAH ORDAINED ANDTHEN REDUCED TO FIVE%0D%0AThereafter, fifty salaah were ordained upon me. When I returned, passed by Moosa (Alaihis salaam), who asked me what 1 had done for my ummah. I informed him that 1 had been ordered to offer fifty salaah. He replied, 'I know the nature of people better than you. I had tried my level best with the Banu Israeel (but they were unable to properly observe even their compulsory salaah).\" Since 1 am certain that your ummah will also not be able to perform it, you may request your Rabb to reduce its number.' 1 returned and requested Allah Ta'ala to reduce it and He reduced it to forty. Moosa (Alaihis salaam) again repeated what he had mentioned before. So, I appealed to Allah to further reduce the salaah and it was brought down to thirty. Moosa (Alaihis salaam) again told me to request Allah Ta'ala to reduce it, and it was brought down to twenty. Then Moosa (Alaihis salaam) repeated his advice, and after again requesting Allah, it was reduced to ten. When 1 returned to Moosa (Alaihis salaam), he reiterated his advice to me, so I returned to Allah Ta'ala to beg more leniency and He reduced it to five salaah daily. 1 returned to Moosa (Alaihis salaam) and he repeated what he had said to me before, but 1 informed him that I had accepted (and decided to make no further request). Thereupon, an announcement was heard from Allah Ta'ala: \"I have retained the ordinance of salaah and lessened the burden of my worshippers and I will multiply the reward of every good deed tenfold (i.e. even though only five salaah will have to be performed, the reward will be for fifty).\" This narration is in Sahih Bukhaari on page 455.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn Sahih Bukhaari (p. 47 1) in the narration of Anas bin Maalik (Radiallahu anhu) from Abu Zar (Radiallahu anhu), Rasulullah * said: \"Jibraeel (Alaihis salaam) ascended even higher with me until I reached a point from where the screech of pens could be heard.? %0D%0A%0D%0AThereafter, this Hadith mentions the ordinance of fifty times salaah and the repeated advice of Moosa (Alaihis salaam) to Nabi %40 until eventually only five salaah daily were prescribed. Finally, it mentions that Allah Ta'ala said: \"The decree that comesfrom Me cannot be changed\" (i.e. since I had initially ordained fifty salaah, 1 shall grant the reward of fifty salaah). Describing the Sidratul Muntahaa, Rasulullah 4 said, 'It was veiled in such (resplendent) colours of which I have no knowledge..... Thereafter I was ushered into Jannah where I saw domes of pearls, and its sand was of musk.'%0D%0A%0D%0AOn page 548, Imaam Bukhaari (Rahimahullah) records another Hadith on Mi'raaj reported by Maalik bin Sa'saa Ansaari (Radiallahu anhu) from Anas (Radiallahu anhu) where, after mentioning about AI-Baitul Ma'moor, Rasulullah %40 recounts the incident of his accepting the vessel of milk as well as his reply to Moosa (Alaihis salaam) after five salaah remained: \"So much have 1 asked my Lord that 1 am now ashamed. 1 am satisfied and have accepted (the order of my Rabb).\"%0D%0A%0D%0A(End of Bukhaari Hadith).%0D%0A"
