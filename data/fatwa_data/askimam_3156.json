  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy question is about making Qaadah salaat. What must one do if he is unsure of which, and how many, salaat he has missed? My situation is such that due to school, work, etc I have missed various Salaat in the past 10 years, but obviously do not remember which ones. What should I do? Jazakallah Khaire.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person does not remember the date, month or year of the missed Salaats,\nhe should apply his honest discretion and follow that.\n\nIf the person is satisfied that he has fulfilled all his Qadhaa Salaats,\nthen he may discontinue making Qadhaa Salaats.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
