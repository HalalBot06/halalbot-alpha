  "question": "I wish to perform my Qada (missed Salaat). Is it permissable to skip the present Sunnah Maukidah salaats to give more time to the Fard missed salaat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlso refer below%0D%0A%0D%0AQ: Kindly explain in detail the Shari'ah laws of performing Qadhaa Salaats.%0D%0AYour advice in fulfilling the Qadhaa Salaats will be appreciated.%0D%0AA: Qadhaa is made only for Fardh and Witr Salaats.%0D%0AIn calculation, there will be six (6) Salaats per day, one hundred and%0D%0Aeighty (180) Salaats per month, two thousand, one hundred and sixty (2160)%0D%0ASalaats per year. Calculate the number of missed Salaats from the time of%0D%0ABuloogh (maturity). If one is unable to calculate the actual number of%0D%0Amissed Salaats, due to not having any records, then he%2Fshe should apply%0D%0Ahis%2Fher honest discretion in calculating the missed Salaats.%0D%0AIt is not permissible to give Fidyah (monetary compensation) for the missed%0D%0ASalaats if one is able to fulfil the Qadhaa Salaats. The Fidya for each%0D%0Amissed Salaat is the same as Sadaqatul Fitr (approx. R7.00). The approximate%0D%0Aamount for the missed Salaats for one year will be (approx. R15,000). A%0D%0Abequest should be made during one's lifetime to pay the Fidya for the%0D%0Aunfulfilled Qadhaa Salaats from one third of one's estate after fulfillment%0D%0Aof debts.%0D%0AThank Allah Ta'ala for giving you the concern to fulfil the missed Salaats.%0D%0AHow will one face Allah Ta'ala on the day of Qiyaamat should he%2Fshe pass%0D%0Aaway without fulfilling the Qadhaa Salaats? An easy method to fulfil the%0D%0AQadhaa Salaats is, after each daily Fardh Salaat, for example, after Dhuhr%0D%0ASalaat of today, perform one Dhuhr Qadhaa Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AQADHAA SALAAT%0D%0A%0D%0A1. If a person misses a salaat, then on remembering it, he should%0D%0Aimmediately make qada of it. It is a sin to delay offering a qada salaat%0D%0Awithout any valid excuse. So if a person misses a salaat and does not make%0D%0Aqada of it immediately, but postpones it to another time or to another day,%0D%0Aand then he suddenly dies - then he will get a double sin. One for missing%0D%0Athe salaat, and the other for not making qada of it immediately.%0D%0A2. If a person misses several salaats, then as far as possible, he should%0D%0Amake qada of all. If it is possible, he should make an effort to offer all%0D%0Aof them at one time. It is not necessary that the qada of zuhr be offered in%0D%0Azuhr time or that the qada of asr be offered at Asr time. If he has to make%0D%0Aqada for several months or several years, then as far as possible he should%0D%0Amake qada of them as quickly as possible. He should try and offer several%0D%0Aqada salaats in one salaat time. However, if he is compelled or has no%0D%0Aalternative, then he should offer one qada salaat in one salaat time. But%0D%0Athis is the minimum.%0D%0A3. There is no stipulated time for qada salaat. Whenever one gets the%0D%0Aopportunity, lie should make his wudu and offer his salaat. However, he%0D%0Ashould take the Makruh times of salaat into consideration.%0D%0A4. If a person has only one qada salaat to offer and before this he never%0D%0Amissed any salaat, or he had missed in the past but he made qada of all of%0D%0Athem; then he should offer this one qada salaat before offering any other%0D%0Asalaat. If he offers any other salaat without offering this qada salaat,%0D%0Athen that salaat will not be valid. He must offer the qada salaat and repeat%0D%0Athat other salaat. However, if he completely forgot to offer the qada%0D%0Asalaat, then the other salaat will be valid. When he remembers, lie will%0D%0Amerely have to offer the qada salaat and it will not be necessary to repeat%0D%0Athe other Salaat.%0D%0A5. If the time is so short that if he offers the qada salaat first, he will%0D%0Amiss the other salaat; then he should offer the other salaat first and then%0D%0Aoffer the qada salaat.%0D%0A6. A person misses two, three, four, or five s.alaats; and does riot have to%0D%0Aread any other salaat for the past. That is, from the time he became mature,%0D%0Ahe did not miss any salaat; or if he missed, he made qada of all. Then as%0D%0Along as he does not offer these five salaats, it will not be permissible to%0D%0Aoffer any other salaat. When he offers these five qada salaats, he should%0D%0Aoffer them in the same order as he had missed them; i.e. the one that lie%0D%0Amissed first should be offered first and the one that he missed second%0D%0Ashould be offered second, and so on. For example, if a person misses the%0D%0Asalaats of an entire day: fajr, zuhr, asr, maghrib, and esha; then when he%0D%0Ais offering his qada, he should offer it in the same order. If he does not%0D%0Aoffer fajr first, but zuhr or asr, or any other salaat; then this will not%0D%0Abe proper. He will have to repeat it.%0D%0A7. If a person has to make qada of six salaats or more. then he can offer%0D%0Aany other salaat without having offered the six salaats of qada. And when he%0D%0Aoffers these six salaats, he does not have to offer them in the order that%0D%0Ahe missed them. He can offer them in any order that he wishes. Now it is not%0D%0Awajib to offer them in order.%0D%0A8. Several months or several years have passed and the person hasn't offered%0D%0Athose six or more salaats. However, thereafter he always offered his salaats%0D%0Aon time and did not allow himself to miss any salaat. After all these months%0D%0Aor years, he now misses one salaat. So even in this case it will be%0D%0Apermissible to read all other salaats without making qada of those that lie%0D%0Amissed. When offering these salaats, he does not even have to follow any set%0D%0Aorder.%0D%0A9. A person had to offer six or more qada salaats and therefore did not have%0D%0Ato offer them in the order that he missed them. However, he offered these%0D%0Asalaats by reading one or two at a time and thereby completed all of them.%0D%0ANow, no salaat is left which he has to make qada of. So now, if misses out%0D%0Aone to five salaats again; he will have to make qada of them in the order%0D%0Athat he missed and it will not be permissible for him to offer any other%0D%0Asalaat without offering these qada salaats first. But if he misses out six%0D%0Asalaats or more again, he will again be excused from offering them in the%0D%0Aorder that he missed them. And he will also be able to offer other salaats%0D%0Awithout having offered his qada salaats first.%0D%0A10. A person had many qada salaats to offer. He commenced reading them and%0D%0Agradually completed all of them with the exception of four or five. So now%0D%0Ait is not Waajib to offer these four or five salaats in order. He has the%0D%0Achoice of offering them as he wishes. It is also permissible for him to%0D%0Aoffer other salaats without having offered these qada salaats.%0D%0A11. A person missed out witr salaat and does not have any other qada salaat%0D%0Ato offer. So it is not permissible for him to offer the fajr salaat without%0D%0Ahaving offered the qada of witr salaat first. If he knows that he has to%0D%0Amake qada of the witr salaat first and still offers the fajr salaat first,%0D%0Athen he will have to offer the qada salaat of witr and then repeat the fajr%0D%0Asalaat.%0D%0A12. A person offered only his esha salaat and slept away. He then awoke for%0D%0Atahajjud, made wudu and offered his tahajjud and witr salaats. In the%0D%0Amorning he remembered that he had forgetfully offered his esha salaat%0D%0Awithout wudu. He will now have to make qada of the esha salaat only, and not%0D%0Athe witr salaat.%0D%0A13. Qada is only made for the fard and witr salaats, and not for the sunnah%0D%0Asalaats. However, if a person misses out his fajr salaat and makes qada of%0D%0Ait before mid-day, then he should also make qada of the sunnah of fajr%0D%0Asalaat. And if he makes the qada after mid-day, then lie should only make%0D%0Aqada of the the fard salaat.%0D%0A14. If there was very little time left for fajr and he therefore only read%0D%0Athe fard salaat, then it is preferable to offer the sunnah salaat after the%0D%0Asun has risen considerably. But he has to read it before mid-day.%0D%0A15. A person who rarely used to offer his salaats made taubah. It will now%0D%0Abe wajib for him to make qada of all those salaats which he had missed%0D%0Athroughout his life. By making taubah, one is not excused from offering his%0D%0Asalaats. However, he is forgiven from the sin which he committed by missing%0D%0Aout the salaats. Now, if he does not make qada of these missed salaats, the%0D%0Asin will return to him.%0D%0A16. A person had missed several salaats and did not get the opportunity to%0D%0Amake qada of them as yet. At the time of death, it will be wajib for him to%0D%0Amake a wasiyyat to pay fidyah for all the missed salaats. He will be sinning%0D%0Ait he does not do this. The masa'il related to giving fidyah for missed%0D%0Asalaats will be explained in Part Three in the chapter dealing with fidyah%0D%0Afor missed fasts - Insha Allah.%0D%0A17. If several people have missed a particular salaat then they should make%0D%0Aqada of it with jama'at. And if it is a salaat in which qira'at is normally%0D%0Amade aloud, then when making qada, it should also be recited aloud. If it is%0D%0Anormally made softly, then it should also be made softly.%0D%0A18. If an immature child offers his esha salaat and sleeps away, and after%0D%0Athe break of dawn he notices traces of semen which indicates that he had a%0D%0Awet dream, then the preferred opinion is that he should repeat his esha%0D%0Asalaat. And if he wakes up before the break of dawn and notices traces of%0D%0Asemen, then all the ulama say that he will have to make qada of the esha%0D%0Asalaat."
