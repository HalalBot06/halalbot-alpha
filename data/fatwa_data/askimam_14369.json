  "question": "What does one person need to be qualified Mufti in Islam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat does one person need to be qualified Mufti in Islam? As there are many web sites that offer to issue a fatwa how does one person know that the Mufti that is issuing a fatwa has sufficient knowledge to do so?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe are two aspects of a Mufti\n\n1. Academic knowledge\n\n2. Guidance of an experienced teacher\n\nThese two factors are vital in becoming a Mufti. However, the second factor is more important than the first. Mufti Shafi Saheb a leading Mufti of the subcontinent states that a Mufti is he who studies under the tutorship of his Ustaad, and the ways and habits of the Ustaad penetrate into him, he in reality is a true Mufti. One cannot simply become a Mufti on his own by sitting in front of a computer screen searching websites. He would have to sit in the company of those who are involved in the field of Fatawaa for many years and learn from their expertise and experience. A true Mufti is not one who can research and answer queries. But a true mufti is he who is acquainted with the conditions of the community, world and realizes what the Anjaam (end result) of his Fatwa/ruling would be. For example he knows that if he would respond to a query, it would create more Fitna (mischief) in a community, he abstains from issuing any ruling.\n\nÂ \n\nThe second aspect is that a Mufti has academic skill in researching the various questions and has ability to satisfy the questioner. This one would learn in the company of his Ustaad who had in turn learnt from his teacher and so on. Therefore one should not become deceived by the modern technology and assume that becoming a Mufti is to learn one or two rulings and that would make one a Mufti. I conclude with the words of Mufti Mahmood Hasan Gangohi (R.A) the chief Mufti of India, \"A Mufti is he who looks at his surroundings and issue a Fatwa\". This will only be achieved in the company of those who have long standing experience in the field of Fataawa.\n\nThe repercussions of self study and becoming a Mufti would be destruction and confusion. Since there would be no guidance from a senior, one could be led astray and would lead others astray.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
