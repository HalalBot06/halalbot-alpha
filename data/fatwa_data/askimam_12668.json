  "question": "I discovered a website & magazine for 'queer Muslims'. It shocked me that there are 'queer Muslim' leaders opening Mosques and teaching. Can anything be done about this?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow can 'queer Muslim' leaders guide the Ummah?? I think it is a very serious issue and feel that something should be done to help the misguided. Shukran\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is really shocking that people of this type are being given positions of honour in the Muslim community. This is indeed a sign of Qiyamah. These people are astray and will lead others stray. It is the responsibility of the members of these communities to ensure that these people are removed from their posts.\n\nHomosexuality and lesbianism are completely forbidden in Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl.
