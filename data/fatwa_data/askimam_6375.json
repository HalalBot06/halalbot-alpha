  "question": "Is it haram to talk to someone of the opposite sex even if you are interested in them for marriage purposes only and you dont talk about haram things nor do you see them?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI dont see how you can fully know whether somoene is of good moral and ethical standing for marriage, if you dont talk to them and get to know what kind of person they are in a halal fashion? They may appear to be good muslims on the outside but in reality arent.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTalking to a person for a little while will not give you a true indication of his/her moral character.\n\nWhen you go to see a girl and speak to her, she will obviously portray her best character. Therefore, we find your argument based on a very shaky ground. There are other ways of determining a woman's moral character. Haraam will remain Haraam no matter how we justify otherwise.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
