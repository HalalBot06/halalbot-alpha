  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhen i was younger i used to masturbate whilst fasting. Only recently have I discovered that masturbating breaks ones fast. I cannot recall how many times I masturbated and hence the number of fasts. How do I recompensate for the fasts broken?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n In the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nMasturbating is a major sin, such a person is cursed by Allah Ta’āla and his Prophet sallallahu ῾alayhi wasallam, Therefore, one should sincerely repent from this evil habit.    \n\n                                                                                      \n\nIn the state of fasting, if one has to ejaculates after masturbating, then he will have to repeat this fast and there is no kaffārah.\n\n(Fatāwa Rahimiyyah, Vol.7, Pg.262, Dārul ῾Ishā῾at)\n\n \n\nApply your discretion in estimating the number of qadhā (missed fasts) and then fast accordingly1. While observing missed fasts of Ramadan, it is not necessary to specify the day and date, however, if one has missed few fasts of two or more Ramadāns, then it will be necessary to specify the year.2\n\n (Fatāwa Dāurl ῾Uloom Deoband, Vol.6, Pg.429, Maktabah Imdadiyyah)1\n\n(Bahisti Zewar, Pg.314, Zam Zam)2\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best  \n\nMl. Abduz Zaman,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nConcured by:\n\nMl. Abdur Rahman Shareef, Student Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nUnder the guidance of:\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai Saheb\n\n\n\n(2010-09-06)"
