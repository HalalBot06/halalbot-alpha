  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaikum For some years now i have been suffering from what psychologists call obsessive compulsive disorder. It causes me to wash my hands/clothing/objects numerous as i feel they are napaak.Is this real or is it just the whisperings of the shaytaan? Pyramid schemes - one has to give a certain amount of money to become a part of this organistion .You than try to get as many people interested in the concept as possible . As these people buy from selected stores they than get a discount and you get a percentage of what they paid.Is this permissible in islaam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nUndoubtedly, when Shaytaan was banished from paradise, he swore an oath to%0D%0Alead the progeny of Aadam (Alayhis salaam) astray.

He%0D%0Amisleads some by trying to keep them away from the worship of Allah Ta'ala.%0D%0Afor other, he will distract their worship. Shaytaan is trying to keep you%0D%0Aaway from Ibaadat (i.e. to be Paak) by instilling doubts in the heart. He%0D%0Awould keep trying till he succeeds.

When you wash, be cautious and careful,%0D%0Ataking care in your washings, yet be swift. Thereafter, disregard all doubts%0D%0Aand recite, 'A'oodhu billaah' when a doubt occrs.
