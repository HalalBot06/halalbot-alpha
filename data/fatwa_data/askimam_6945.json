  "question": "I read somewhere that Shaitan told the prophet (s) some false Quranic verses to confuse the prophet (s). I was wondering if this really did happen, was the Prophet really tricked by shaitan this way?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlthough certain books of Tafseer have quoted this incident, this narration is incorrect.\n\nThe most that can be said is that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) paused in his recitation and Shaytaan read out a poem in praise of their idols. People were made to think that this was the recitation of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). (Haashiyatul Jamal ? Tafseer Jalaalayn)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
