  "question": "Is it allowed to give loan to a person(without interest) to a person who has already taken a loan with interest",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu alaikum Mifti saheb. My father-in-law recently took housing loan from a bank(on interest).Bank gave only Rs.3 lacks. The house he bought is 5.5 lacks. At that time he is not having the remaining 2.5 lacks. He might have expected some money (say Rs.50,000) from me. But he did not ask me at that time. I did not give him a word. Now the time has come to pay the total amount. He has to pay Rs 1.5 lacks now. I think thy are palanning to ask me some money as loan (Ofcourse I give without interest). (1)My doubt is, Can I help him(If he does not ask my help also) by giving some money as loan? Why I am asking this is he is committing sin by buying house by taking loan from bank. If I give him some money, Is it like helping a person in committing sin? (2) He is working for a government of India enterprise. According to Government rules, one who is doing Government job is not allowed to do any other jobs. But my uncle teach spoken English privately and earn money. He doesn't pay taxes to the government for the money earned by spoken english teachings. Is that money earned by Spoken English teachings Haram. (3) If I give him loan, If he returns money can I take?Will it be halal for me?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. No, you will not be involved in sin by assisting him to repay this loan. In fact, it is better for you to assist him in trying to get out of this Riba-based quagmire.\n\n2. He is at liberty to use his free time as he wishes and his employer has no right to interfere with his free time. Hence, the income received is Halaal.\n\n3. What gives you the doubt? If he repays your loan, it is permissible for you to accept.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
