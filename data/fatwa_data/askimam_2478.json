  "question": "Keeping of statues, does Shariah recognize concepts like 'heritage belongs to all humanity' in the case of pictures, images and statues, and Taliban.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) The keeping of statues in museums and other public places? 2) The keeping of statues as objects of worship confined in places of worship by non-muslim minorities? 3) Is it correct to criticize, Darul Islam, if it decides to destroy all pictures, images, statues and carvings? And what is the position of a Muslim's Imaan if he decides to criticize like this? 4) Can Darul Islam protect statues and such just for the purposes of culture or heritage? 5) Does Shariah recognize concepts like 'heritage belongs to all humanity' in the case of pictures, images and statues? 6) Is it correct to take as a valid argument that Amr bin al-'As Radhi allahu anhu did not break statues during his governorship of Egypt, therefore it is wrong for the Taliban to break statues? 7) Lastly, did the Taliban go against Shariah by destroying images and statues in Afghanistan?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. This is not permissible.\n2. This is permissible as long as it is not exposed to the public.\n3. It is the duty of Darul Islam to destroy statues and idols found in public places. One who criticises them may be a Muslim, but has weak Imaan.\n4. 'Culture' and 'heritage' are no valid reasons for allowing idols to be displayed.\n5. Shari'ah does not recognise such concepts with regards to images and statues.\n6. This argument is incorrect.\n7. It was an Islamic duty for the Taliban to have destroyed the statues. This should have been carried out a long time ago.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
