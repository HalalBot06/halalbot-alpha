An oath in Islam can only be taken by the name of Allah or by specific qualities of Allah Ta’ala. (Qudoori, P231)\n\nInsha Allah, the unborn child will not be affected by this oath.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nZakariyya Madatt,\n\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
