  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nRecently I saw a response on your website indicating that we should not ask from Allah(swt) against something like making a dua that if my so and so request is fullfilled I'll give charity.\nBut I have heard that its mentioned in the Quran that we can make mannat of Fard things (like Salah, Fast, Zakat(charity) etc)\nI always make an intention or make dua to Allah(swt) that if my so and so request is fulfilled or if I get so and so I'll pray 2 rakah nafl salah or I'll Fast for a day. Couple of times I have made niyaah for Salah and charity both. (but never for charity alone). And Alhamdullilah when I ever I make such dua it's 99.5% accepted, if not in 0.5% cases then somehow its beneficial to me which I realize later. Do I stop making such duas? Please assist. May Allah give you Jannat-e-Firdaus.\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThere are many reasons why it is disliked or detestable for one to make a vow. One reason is that a person is basing his obedience and worship to Allah Ta’ala on his desires i.e. if Allah Ta’ala grants him his wish, he would be obedient and if Allah Ta’ala in His infinite wisdom and mercy decides otherwise, the individual would not be obedient Allah Ta’ala.\n\nAnother reason that vows are not advisable is that one may tend to believe that his wish was accomplished because he made a vow. This is incorrect as everything is predestined by Allah Ta’ala (Taqdeer). Many narrations clearly point out to the fact that vows do not change taqdeer. Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم  explained that vows do not change or do not bring good nor does it avert away evil.\n\nصحيح البخارى – 6692 دار طوق النجاة\n\nحدثنا سعيد بن الحارث أنه سمع ابن عمر - رضى الله عنهما - يقول أولم ينهوا عن النذر إن النبى - صلى الله عليه وسلم - قال « إن النذر لا يقدم شيئا ، ولا يؤخر ، وإنما يستخرج بالنذر من البخيل » .\n\n \n\nصحيح البخارى – 6693 دار طوق النجاة\n\nعن عبد الله بن عمر نهى النبى - صلى الله عليه وسلم - عن النذر وقال « إنه لا يرد شيئا ، ولكنه يستخرج به من البخيل » .\n\n \n\nصحيح البخارى 6694 دار طوق النجاة\n\nعن أبى هريرة قال قال النبى - صلى الله عليه وسلم - « لا يأتى ابن آدم النذر بشىء لم يكن قدر له ، ولكن يلقيه النذر إلى القدر قد قدر له ، فيستخرج الله به من البخيل ، فيؤتى عليه ما لم يكن يؤتى عليه من قبل » .\n\nTherefore, it is not advisable to take vows. If one wants his duas to be answered, he should adhere to the teaching of Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم, follow the commands of Allah Ta’ala and stay away from that which is prohibited. Allah Ta’ala says in the Noble Quran:\n\nومن يتق الله يجعل له مخرجا (الطلاق 2)\n\nWhoever fears Allah, He brings forth a way out for him (65:2)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Ishaq E.
