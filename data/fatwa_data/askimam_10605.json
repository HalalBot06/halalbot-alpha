  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease forgive us for the submission of multiple questions in one go? (a) Is it permissible to enshroud ourselves with indian sarees if it covers the stomach but exposes the arms below the elbows - of course the question relates to permissibility in front of mahram. (b) Which would be more rewarding : Sadaqah (that we save over time and send to India/Pakistan/Bangladesh for the poor people) OR taking a muslim person out with the intention to get him closer to myself so that I can give him da'wah towards the deen of Allaah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. A female is required to cover her body as well as conceal the form and shape of her body. Covering the body with the Sarie may be achieved but the form and shape of the body is not concealed. Therefore, it is not permissible for a Muslim female to wear a Sarie.\n\n2. Both the acts, giving Sadaqah to the poor and needy and giving Da?awah are equally important. It is advisable to engage in both these acts to the best of one?s ability.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
