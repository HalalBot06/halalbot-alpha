  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nNeed dua for rizq and some other family problems\n\nSalaam, Me and my husband have been married for the past year. Since that day we have faced alot of problems regarding financial issues mostly. My husband cant work due to a sponsorship application that has been in process since march and we havent heard anything other than the words 'In process' from them... im the only one working at the moment and due to the work load I get sick alot. I would appreciate it if you could give me a Wazeefa for my husbands application process and also for financial stability in the family. I am trying my best to pray five times a day and make dua for the family situation and everything else going on around us but I would appreciate any help and guidance. Wasalaam\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is important that apart from Duas and Wazifas, your husband will have to make an effort to seek his sustenance. It is surprising that he has chosen one avenue and sent his application. If they are saying its being processed for such a long time, it may be that they are not interested in employing him. He should therefore not rely on this application and move ahead by seeking another job.\n\nSitting at home and adopting the wait and see attitude will yield no benefit. You should explain to him that he cannot shift the entire responsibility of supporting the family on you. He would have to take the initiative and move quickly in doing that. Together with that he should be punctual with his salaah and dua to Allah to put Barakah in his work and Rizq and efforts in achieving all that.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
