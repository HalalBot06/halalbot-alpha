  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni want to ask something about \"hisaab kitaab\" on the day of Qayamah. somebody posted a Hadees on a discussion forum about the people who will enter into the Jannah without \"hisaab kitaab\". i have also heared many times from Ulma that there will be some people who will go into the Jannah without hisaab kitaab. another member on that discussion forum said that there are several ayaat in Quran Pak about hisaab kitaab which said that there MUST be the hisaab kitaab of everyone. for reference see (4/86), (21/47), (1/21). He said that Ahadees on this issue are not true as Allah clearly said in Quran that there must be hisaab kitaab of everyone, and he said that Ahadees which seems to be in conflict with Qurani ayaat should be rejected. please guide me on this issue in some detail as i have to show your answer to him.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nOn the day of Qiyaamat, there will be 3 groups of people in regard to Hisaab. The first group are those who will enter Jannah without any reckoning. Once Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] told the Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhum] that he was shown a crowd of people on the horizon and was told that this is your Ummah and of them are 70 thousand who will enter Jannah without any account being taken from them. Then, the Prophet [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘They are those who do not make Ta’weez (amulets) nor seek them, nor seek omens but trust in their Lord…’ (Bukhari Hadith6541)\n\nThe second group of people are those who will get their book of deeds in the right hand and will have an easy reckoning. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said that an easy reckoning is when the book of deeds will merely be presented to Allah (without questioning). (Sahih Bukhari Hadith103).\n\nThe third group of people are those whose books of deeds will be scrutinized. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Whose books are scrutinized will not be able to escape the punishment of Allah.’ (Ibid).\n\nIf a famous authentic Hadith apparently contradicts any Aayat of the Qur’aan, the Hadith will not be rejected. But it will have to be understood in the correct context.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
