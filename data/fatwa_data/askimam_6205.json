  "question": "How can I help someone to not commit a sin. She is a Catholic and practices her religion. I found out that she would participate in other forms of sexual activity with this boy if she felt the need to",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI recently graduated from High School. I am an 18-year-old male. I never made any female friends until earlierthis year. This relationship during a group discussion the topic of sex was brought up. I openly tell everyone that I abstain from sex until marriage (and that is the best way). There are not many people like this these days. It just so happened that a girl agreed with me that it is best to abstain. At that point I reserved some respect for her. Because we often had classes I had the opportunity to know her. She is a good girl who has never done anything lustful before. However, recently she has been seeing a boy. She is a Catholic and practices her religion. I also found out that she would participate in other forms of sexual activity with this boy if she felt the need to. I have no attraction to her, but I feel obliged to convince her that she should not participate in any sexual activities until marriage and not only abstain from intercourse. If you could please tell me how to convince her that she is contradicting herself and her own religion, it would be a great benefit. I know that fornication is fornication without technicality. She thinks that depending on the type, they are two different things and only intercourse is forbidden. Please help me if you can. I feel that I can make a difference if I can stop her from committing a grave sin.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nInstead of advising her to abstain from a particular sin, why not convince\nher to accept Islam? Invite her towards the comprehensive Deen of Islam.\n\nAlso, you should avoid talking unnecessarily to people of the opposite sex\nas Hijaab rules are being compromised.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
