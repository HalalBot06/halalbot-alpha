  "question": "Is watching soccer haraam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRasulullah (Sallallaaahu √Ålayhi Wasallam) said, \"Every game of man is Haraam except three: a man plays with his wife, breaking (training) one's horse and archery.\" referring to this hadith ... would watching soccer be haraam? Also is it haraam for women to watch men playing soccer? And when girls watch soccer they offen say \"oh this player is so cute ext\" and things like that... is this Zinaa? And how do i tell my fellow sisters that this is haraam because when i do they say \"but you commit so many other sins so put yourself right first\" JazakAllah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two issues to your questions, a) Sports in general, b)%0D%0AContemporary sports.%0D%0A%0D%0ASports in general is permissible on condition there is nothing un-Islamic in%0D%0Athem. Sports is a means of a person being strong and healthy. That is%0D%0Aencouraged in the Hadith. However, contemporary sports is contaminated with%0D%0Amany un-Islamic activities. Some are, music, intermingling of sexes,%0D%0Agambling, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn view of the un-Islamic activities surrounding contemporary sports, it is%0D%0Anot permissible to participate in that in any way as that is death to one's%0D%0Aspirituality. That includes watching the sports as well. Hence, we are not%0D%0Asurprised with the illicit remarks made by females watching men play soccer.%0D%0AYou should apply wisdom and explain your fellow sisters the negative aspects%0D%0Aof following contemporary sports. Expressing truth with wisdom always has a%0D%0Adegree of effect. If everyone waits to be infallible in order to prohibit%0D%0Awrong, no body will qualify to prohibit wrong at all.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
