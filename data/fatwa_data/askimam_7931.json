  "question": "I go on jammat and I have a lot of doubts about the work. Iâ€™ve been out for three days a couple of times and I have also been on forty days.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI?ve been out for three days a couple of times and I have also been on forty days. I notice brother often blow rewards that you get on jammat way out of proportion. For example if you die on jammat do you die shahid? And brothers count ,add, and calculate their rewards due to them from ALLAH. I notice a lot of hadith about jihad (warfare not jihad on nufs) are transferred over to tablighi jammat why? Also is it true that the brother that does khidma for the jammat gets all the rewards for all the ibadah the whole jammat does during the time he is on khidma. To tell you the truth I don?t want to go on jammat anymore could you tell me of something that has more rewards and virtues that going on jammat. How do you join a jihad movement and what are the legitimate jihads and jihad groups.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Tabligh movement is a high and noble work which has proven its benefit worldwide. The principles of this work which was laid down by those who sacrificed their night and day for this work are there to govern the Tabligh brothers.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, it is sad to note that some of the Tablighi brothers do not stay in the confines of these principles. Hence, creating a lot of confusion amongst the masses. It is incorrect because of these few brothers to distant yourself from the Tabligh Jamaat. Though the brothers are wrong, the work is noble and great and moreso the fundamental object of every prophet (Alayhis salaam).%0D%0A%0D%0AWe humbly suggest you continue with the Jamaat and benefit from the good and leave the bad. The rewards of going out in Jamaats are great. In Sahih Muslim, there is a Hadith wherein (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?The dust and smoke of Jahannum can never be combined on a person out in the path of Allah.? which basically means any dust settles on a persons body out in the path of Allah. The smoke of hell can never touch that part of the body.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0Afor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
