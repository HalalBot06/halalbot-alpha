  "question": "re-8123: I'd like to know if not being able to forgive another person who has caused much distress makes me a sinner and does the fact that the other person asked mean he is forgiven anyway?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am however still not very clear of the answers to the questions I raised. I know that you should forgive,as i mentioned in my original question I dont dispute that it is commendable, but being as weak as I am I'd like to know if not being able to forgive another person who has caused much distress makes me a sinner and does the fact that the other person asked mean he is forgiven anyway? Also I cannot extend your initial answer to answer my question on the issue of someone having done/said something due to the influence of jinn,not having been actually possesed but influenced by jinn by some other means, is the person absolved of any responsibility for the pain he has caused?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person has wronged you, it is most certainly your right to forgive the person. If you did not forgive the person in the world, the matter will be carried over to the hereafter in the court of Allah Ta?ala.\n\nIt is possible that a person?s character is affected by being possessed by a Jinn or black magic. If such a person has wronged you due to that, in principle, he/she must seek your forgiveness. The individual will be judged by Allah Ta?ala according to his/her intentions.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
