  "question": "i am 18, i am trying to grow a beard, but my mom thinks im too young and says i dont need to keep it.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\ni have told her its sunnah and some people say it is wajib so i want to keep it, but she doesnt like it. am i supposed to keep it anyway, or should i listen to her and shave it because it doesnt look good\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n'For Muslim males to grow a beard is Waajib (compulsory), and to let it grow a fist length is Waajib. Without any Shar√©e reason to cut or shave is Haraam (totally prohibited). He who does so is a Faasiq (sinner) and to shorten it less than a fist length is Makruh Tahrimi (near Haraam).' Dari Aur Ambiyaa Ki Sunnate, Mufti Saeed Palanpuri.\n\nYou should not obey your mother?s wish against the orders of Shari?ah. You should keep a beard and follow the Sunnah of our beloved Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
