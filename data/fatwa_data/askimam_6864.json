  "answer": "QUESTION\nI've been having a problem with my period. 1)It usually lasts 7 days, but I cannot define exactly when it finishes. I think my menses is over and I make gushl, but later it turns out that I still have it, because there are some spots of blood on my underwear. So I repeat ghusl again and some times again.... My grandma is angry with me, because I use so much water. Do I have to repeat gushl again if it turns out that I made a mistake? Please help. I'm 15yrs old, lately converted . My family is a christian one so they don't understand that I must make gushl.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour zeal and enthusiasm to learn and practice Islam is encouraging. May Allah Ta?ala be pleased with you and keep you steadfast, Aameen.\n\nYou should not take a bath until you are absolutely sure that your menses have ended. If there is a possibility that you will still experience menses, based on your experience then do not take a bath. If you did not experience menses after having taken a bath then you should calculate how many Salaats you have missed since your menses have stopped and make up for them thereafter.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
