  "answer": "QUESTION\nin the previous months i tried to create panic in the life of on of my friend.he did not know that i did all the problems for him. now i realize that i did the wrong.i can not tell him that i did all this.but i want Tawbah.Will Allah give me forgiveness if i say Tawbah.and what is the right way.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIdeally, you should lower yourself and seek the forgiveness of your friend.\n\nHowever, if your friend does not know you caused inconvenience to him and\nthere was no loss to him in cash or kind, and your seeking forgiveness from\nhim may have serious implications upon you, then you should make sincere\nTawbah. You should also make Du'aa for your friend and do some act of\ncharity with the intention of giving Thawaab (reward) to your friend.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
