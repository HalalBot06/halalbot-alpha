  "question": "What proof is there that Sunnat-e-Muakkadah is Wajib?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nExcuse me for asking, but in an answer to Question 999, you claim that Sunnat-e-Muakkadah is Wajib. But I am yet to find proof. And the Quran says that we have FIVE wajib prayers. Please provide proof inshaAllah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNowhere in question 999 is it stated that Sunnat-e-Muakkadah is Waajib. It appears from your question that you are a bit confused. We suggest you recheck question 999, then get back to us if you still have any objections.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
