  "question": "Can we eat Khat/Qat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni wanted ti inquire about chewing of miraa is it considered as an intoxicantÂ  pls let me know since everyone is considering it a salrite.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe khat plant is known by a variety of names, such as qat in Yemen, chat in Ethiopia, jaad in Somalia and miraa in Kenya.\n\n\nIt used to be chewed mainly by old men but it is now being used by young boys who are in a state of permanent intoxication. In Saudi Arabia, the cultivation and consumption of khat are forbidden, and the ban is strictly enforced. The ban on khat is further supported by the jurists on the grounds that the Qur'an forbids anything that is harmful to the body. This is in sharp contrast to the opinions of the jurists in Yemen.\n\nKhat consumption induces mild ecstasy and excitement. Individuals become very talkative under the influence of the drug and may appear to be unrealistic and emotionally unstable. Khat can induce weird behaviour and hyperactivity. Several cases of khat-induced mental illness have been reported. Khat is an effective anorectic and its use also results in constipation. Dilated pupils, which are prominent during khat consumption, reflect the harmful effects of the drug, which are also reflected in increased heart rate and blood pressure. A state of drowsy hallucinations may result coming down from khat use as well. Withdrawal symptoms that may follow prolonged khat use include lethargy, mild depression, nightmares, and slight tremor.\n\n\nIf we analyse the above we deduce that miraa is considered to be a drug and an intoxicant by experts in this field. The effects of marijuana, opium and miraa are all the same. Therefore to chew on the miraa plant will not be permissible. This also falls in the category as (Banj) henbane which is prohibited. If any of these are used for medicinal purposes then one will be excused with the advice of a medical doctor.\n(Fataawa Mahmudiyya V:18 Pg:178)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
