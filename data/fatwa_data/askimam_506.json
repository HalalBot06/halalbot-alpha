  "question": "Is it permissible for one to perform Salaat with his wife or children (boys and girls)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA male should perform his Salaat with Jamaat in the Masjid. Salaat with Jamaat in the Masjid is 25 times superior than Salaat performed at home. The Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) admonished men reading Salaat in the Masjid. Women should read Salaat individually in their homes. The Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, \"The Salaat of women in the inner part of their house is more virtuous than the Salaat made in the general part of the house.\" (Mishkat)\n\nHowever, if a male Mahram for some legitimate Shar'ee reason did not read his Salaat in the Masjid, he may read his Salaat with the women of the house (mother, sister, wife, etc.) with Jamaat provided the women stand behind the male.\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
