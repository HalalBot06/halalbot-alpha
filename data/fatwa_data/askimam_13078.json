  "question": "Halaal income? insurance co. is paying him a large sum of money, due to whiplash etc.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy husband met with an accident. The insurance co. is paying him a large sum of money, due to whiplash etc. He is now well and able to work. We could use the money to retire, buy a house etc but want to know if this is halaal income. They also paid for the doctor and treatments. We are feeling guilty as the Dr overdramatized everything for us for this large payout. Is this halaal?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe extra amount claimed from the company due to the Doctor?s fictitious claims is not Halaal. This money should be returned to the company or given away to the poor.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Emraan Vawda"
