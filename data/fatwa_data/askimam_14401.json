  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs my mother allowed to give zakat to my brother.\n\nMy mother would like to know if it's allowed to give zakat to my brother who is living in canada (very good muslim) but having around 10000$ of debts because of his last travel to his origin country to visit us and cure his wife suffering from very bad back pain, but he have 2 cars and renting a house from the governement for a cheap price and working for his own as a contractor (renovation). Is it also allowed for me to give him my zakat knowing that it's me who has borrowed him the above money?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to Shariah it is not permissible for parents to offer Zakaat to their children. Therefore, your mother cannot give zakaat to your brother. However, you as a brother could offer your personal zakaat to your brother.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
