  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have a disease. It is from the heart. I fail to recognize the power of Allah. But when it comes time to talk about Islam I am soo inspiring to people. This is twisted. When it is prayer time I ignore it. But if I don't ignore it I pray but not with qushu. Sometimes it hits me that I have to pray and then I do with the upmost attention. But then it goes away. What do I do?? How do I become strong?? I need to. I feel like I'm falling. I know and can feel that Allah is not pleased with me. Help me! Please be very specific in what I should do. I will take ur advise very seriously. Thank you and may Allah reward u for ur work.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour zeal to preach is highly commendable. May Allah Ta'ala grant you Barkat%0D%0Ain that, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is the Barkaat of preaching that you feel the guilt of not practicing%0D%0Awhat you preach. The preaching and the guilt of not practicing is a stepping%0D%0Astone for Islaah (reformation) and progress. However, the driving forces for%0D%0AIslaah are Ikhlaas (sincerity) and courage. Whatever you do, including%0D%0Apreaching, it should be to please Allah Ta'ala Alone and not to inspire%0D%0Apeople, that (sincerity) is not achieved in you're a'amaal, hence, the%0D%0Adifference in approach between preaching and practicing. Furthermore,%0D%0Apracticing requires courage. You should bring up the courage and practice%0D%0Awhat you preach.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe fear of Allah Ta'ala, consciousness of the day of Qiyaamat,%0D%0Aaccountability, fire of Jahannum, etc. may assist you to bring up the%0D%0Acourage for you to practice what you preach. Knowledge without practice will%0D%0Abe a burden on the knowledgeable on the day of Qiyaamat.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
