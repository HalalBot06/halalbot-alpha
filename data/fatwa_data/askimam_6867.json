  "question": "What is Ilm-e-kalam and what does a normal Muslim has to do with it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is Ilm-e-kalam and what does a normal Muslim has to do with it?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIlmul Kalaam is the knowledge of beliefs of Deen wherein a person is able to establish those correct beliefs against others with detailed proofs and repelling any doubts and objections. (Kashf istilaahaatil funoon pg.22)\n\nGoing into such details and depths is only the work of great Ulama and specialists in this field. A normal person should just believe in all those beliefs that are necessary upon him, with there being no need for him to go into finer details as is dealt with in Ilm-ul-Kalaam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
