  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni suffer badly from \"wiswas\". i need some advice very badly on passing wind and regarding mazi and mani\n\ni am in my 20's and i am trying to practice my daily pillars. the thing is i always get very bad wiswas  becasue i always think i have either passed wind during namaz.\n\nthe other matter is that everytime i have a bath, i am not sure as how to prepare myself after nocternal emmission to have a bath. does one have to COMPLETELY dry urine becasue when i press a paper towel against my \"thing\" i can see dots of darkness which is water. im never sure if im completely 100% dry down there, how do i know im properly dry becasue even if theres a drop of urnine so small will that invalidate my bath? this also makes me waste a lot of paper as i keep doing it but the dots keep coming back therefore im not dry yet. this makes me waste a hell lot of time.\n\ni really wanted to perform my daily prayers and i normally try not to sleep sometimes as i dont want to have wet dreams thus i have to re-do the painful procedure of taking a ghusl, then i dont know if my urine was compoletely dry or not. i REALLY want to read namaz and quran and remain in dhikr but this problem of mine just wont let me. could you please tell me the exact procedure of making sure urinze is completely dry as this is such a big probel for me.I AM REALLY DESPERATE AND I WOULD LIKE AS MUCH HELP AS POSSIBLE I CAN GET FROM YOU\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘There is a Shaytaan for everything. There is also a Shaytaan for Wudhu. The Shaytaan whispers in a person and creates doubts in him. The solution to that is to follow a principle. If you are sure of passing wind, then only does your Wudhu break. That is by hearing or smell. If one did not hear or smell the passing of wind, the Wudhu will be intact. Simply follow this and nothing else. If you don’t follow this principle, you will be controlled by Shaytaan.\n\n2. After nocturnal emission, you should relieve yourself thoroughly and wash your private parts. Ensure that the urine is our. That is sufficient. You don’t have to do anything thereafter. There is no need to apply tissue by your private part to see if there is urine or not. The wetness on the tissue will be water and not urine.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
