  "question": "If a woman gets a child after marriage, is all her sins forgiven?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, when a person performs virtuous deeds, his/her minor sins are\nforgiven without making Tawbah.\n\nAs regards major sins, making Tawbah is necessary. To bear a child is indeed\na very great act of virtue. From the inception of pregnancy till birth, the\nwoman is in constant Ibaadat (worship) and is being rewarded for every\nmoment of that time. Therefore, a woman can be optimistic of her minor sins\nbeing forgiven during pregnancy and birth. If Allah wills, He may forgive\nthe major sins as well without her making Tawbah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
