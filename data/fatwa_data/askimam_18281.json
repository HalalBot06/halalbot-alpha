  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am a Sunni Muslim girl from Pakistan. I have a proposal of marriage from a Shia Muslim boy. I want to know \" Is it possible for a Sunni Muslim to marry a Shia Muslim?  Are marriages between Sunni and Shia ok? - Is it allowed in Islam? - What implications will it have?\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nThere are several different types of Shī’ahs, many of them falling out of the boundaries of Islām.  Marriage with such a Shī’ah will be invalid. \n\n \n\nTherefore, you should look for a good proposal from a boy belonging to the Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jamā’ah (Sunnī Muslims) and not marry a Shī’ah.\n\n \n\n(فتاوى رحيمية، كتاب النكاح، محرمات: 8/203-205؛ الإشاعت)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
