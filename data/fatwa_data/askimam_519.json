  "question": "Is the ghusl of those people perform it sitting in a bath of water valid?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe person is using the same water to wash all the parts of his body since the water is not flowing. I am asking this because I used to have a bath but now I just have a shower instead because less water is used. What is the maximum amount of water one can use to perform ghusl? All members of my family have a bath so please tell me if their ghusl is valid.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person is impure (Najis) and has to take a compulsory bath to purify\nhimself, the water in the bath also becomes impure by him sitting in it. The\nwater must be changed in order for the Ghusl to be valid. There is no\nlimitation of using water for Ghusl. However, Shari'ah prohibits abuse by\nwasting water.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
