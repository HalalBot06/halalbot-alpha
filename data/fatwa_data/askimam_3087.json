  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the majority opinion, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was born in the month of Rabi-ul-Awwal, in the year of the elephant. The day of his birth was Monday.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Qataadah (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was asked regarding the fast of Monday. He replied, ?It is the day I was born and also the day when the first revelation was sent upon me.? (Muslim vol1 pg.368; Deoband). %0D%0A%0D%0AThere are differences of opinion on the date of Rasulullah?s (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) birth. Allaamah Kawthari (RA) prefers the 9th of Rabi-ul-Awwal. (Maqaalaatul Kawthari pg.405 - 207). Allaamah Qastalaani (RA) states that the majority of the Muhadditheen and historians have also preferred the 9th of Rabi-ul-Awwal. %0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) passed away in Rabiul-Awwal on a Monday. As regards the date of his demise, there are three opinions: 1, 2 and 12 Rabi-ul-Awwal (Bidaaya Wan Nihaaya vol.5 pg.275)%0D%0AThe 9th Dhul-Hijjah (day of Arafah) in the year 10AH (the year which Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) performed Hajj) was a Friday. If the months Dhul-Hijjah, Muharram and Safar, all were 30 days, or 29 days or some 29 and others 30 days, the 12th Rabi-ul-Awwal did not fall on a Monday. Therefore, the preferred view of the date of Rasulullah?s demise is the 1st or 2nd Rabi-ul-Awwal. Ibn Jarir (RA) prefers the 1st Rabi-ul-Awwal while Ibn Hajar prefers the 2nd Rabi-ul-Awwal. (Al-Mawaahib with Zarqaani vol.1 pg.131)"
