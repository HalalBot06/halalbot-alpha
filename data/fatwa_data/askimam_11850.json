  "question": "Our Ummah really requires ULAMA-E-RABBANI. I am 20 years old right now and I want to go to Islamic University in Prophetâ€™s city, Medina.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaam respected Mufti, The only intention for coming to Canada from Pakistan was to study in some university and become an engineer. I have been living here for 3 years and am about to finish my college which is required before entering in some university. Although, as I told you, the main purpose to come here was to study Sciences & Technology. However, with the mercy of Allah, the West (where kufr prevails) has opened my eyes and it has made me recognize my IDENTITY (i.e., I am Muslim). I have come to know the importance of our deen in our lives. There is no doubt that Muslims should acquire all kinds of knowledge, yet, there must be some balance in Ummah. Where our youth dreams of becoming medical doctors and engineers, some of them should dream of becoming the Scholars of Islam too. Thus, my dream is to become an Islamic scholar rather than adopting another profession. Our Ummah really requires ULAMA-E-RABBANI. I am 20 years old right now and I want to go to Islamic University in Prophet?s city, Medina. My question to you is that is this university authentic for Islamic studies? What influence of the government is in it? Is it influenced by Wahabis or salafis? If yes, where else I can go? Give me some important advices. Jazak Allah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou are correct. There is a great need for Islamic knowledge and reliable Ulama.\n\nWe discourage you from studying in Madina Munawwarah due to the strong Salafi influence.
