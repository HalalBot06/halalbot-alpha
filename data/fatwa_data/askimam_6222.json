  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe are living in a place where muslims are very less. I told my wife to wear hijaab. She is wearing when we got outside. But if she has goes through our neighbourhood, she is not wearing hijaab. She is telling me that all our neighbours are non-muslims and if she wears Hijaab, then only men will look at her. That is she will be different from the rest of the women. I kindly request you clarify me. She is willing to follow islam, but she is telling me. Since we are in a place where Muslims are less, so she says that it is difficult to follow some of the Islamic ways\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFirstly, before discussing anything else, lets take a look at what Allah Ta'%0D%0Aala mentions regarding Hijaab in the Qur'aan. Allah Ta'ala commands Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) that, 'Instruct your wives, your daughters and%0D%0Athe believing women that they should lower upon themselves their veils (the%0D%0AIslamic Hijaab and way of dressing.' (Ahzaab 59) This is a command of Allah%0D%0Aand it is incumbent to practice upon.%0D%0A%0D%0ABy your wife wearing Hijaab, especially in your neighbourhood where there%0D%0Aare only non-Muslims living can be a means of encouragement for the people%0D%0Atowards Islam. After all, the donning of Hijaab is such a dignified way of%0D%0Adressing for a woman because in this way she is concealing what is not%0D%0Apermissible for a strange man's gaze to fall upon. You mentioned that your%0D%0Awife is willing to follow and practice upon the laws of Islam, but due to%0D%0AMuslims being less, it is difficult to practice.%0D%0A%0D%0ABy her practicing and being firm on the laws of Islam and together with%0D%0Ahaving sincere intentions, most definitely this will be a means of%0D%0Aencouraging the other Muslims to practice on their Deen and also a means of%0D%0Ainvitation towards Islam for the non-Muslims. By encouraging others towards%0D%0AIslam and towards the laws of Allah, one will receive the reward of whatever%0D%0Agood the next person practices upon. By Muslim women donning the Islamic way%0D%0Aof dressing, especially in today's time of sin, immodesty and futility, is%0D%0Amaking Islam apparent in its pristine purity. The believing women out there%0D%0Ashould keep in mind that they are the precious gems and pearls of their%0D%0Ahusbands, and to be looked at and enjoyed by non other.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
