  "question": "He did intercourse with her thinking its his wife",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAccording to Bahisti Zewar “A person has sexual intercourse with a woman after mistaking her for his wife. He will have to give her mahrul mithl, and this intercourse with her will not be regarded as adultery, nor will there be any sin.” [Pg 393 – point 16] – (Zam Zam publishers)\n\nCould you please present a scenario where it is possible for a man to mistakenly have sexual intercourse with another woman?  \nDoes Shariah prescribe any etiquettes to sexual relationships?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nWe are not in a position to predict mistakes. However, should such a mistake take place, the ruling as explained in Bahishti Zewar will apply.\nYes.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
