  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs for the punishment of stoning a person to death, are we as Muslims supposed to also follow the rule of Jesus whom said \"Only those of you who are sinless may cast the first stone\". Or can someone who has sinned stone another person to death?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Bible is replete with additions and inconsistencies. We are compelled to adhere to the Qur?aan and Hadith as our source of guidance and not the abrogated teachings of Eesa (Alayhis salaam).\n\nEvery human being except the Ambiyaa (Alayhis salaam) is a sinner. If we apply the aforementioned principle to the punishment of stoning, the penal code of Islam will fall apart. In short, sinners can also stone adulteress to dead provided the punishment is carried out within the Islamic framework of the penal code.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
