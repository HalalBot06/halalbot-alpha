  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease advise if is permissable to open up a savings account under the following conditions:\n\nOne of the banks is offering a savings product where you save your money in an account that does not earn any interest. There are no service fees. As an incentive for people to save money using this product, account holders are placed in a monthly draw where they might win cash prizes. The prize is not guaranteed. Furthermore the account holder's money is never placed at risk.\n\nWill it be permissable to utilise this savings product?\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nIt is permissible to use such a savings product. However when doing so, one should not have an intention of wanting to win a prize through the product. If he does win a prize, it will be permissible.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
