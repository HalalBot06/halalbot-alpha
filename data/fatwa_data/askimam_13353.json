  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. May I work in a company as their agent, taking the whole responsibility of problems with clients. I mean that: a) if someone will order some goods, and then after we have bought them, rejects to buy it, it'll be my \"fault\", so I buy these goods by myself, hoping that in future someone else will buy it. b) if anything goes wrong with post or a client will be not content with goods, I'll pay out all necessary compensation to him (including re-buying goods from him) etc. In plan of profit this cooperation with the company is beneficiary for me (because all of above inshaallah will take place very rarely), but I'd like to know whether it's permissible according to Islam. 2. And one more point: this company's name is \"Atoum\". It's a name of ancient \"god\". But when I asked one of the company's directors regarding this, he said that \"it means nothing\". He knows that it's a name of \"god\", but it seems to be (hopefully) that they've chosen this name not because of that, but just because it's a short rare name. Thanks a lot in advance. May Allah reward you.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nApparently, you are not a (commodity) agent of the company neither an employee. You are merely buying goods from the company and reselling them.\n\nIf this is the case, then According to the conditions mentioned working will be correct.\n\nWith regards to the name of the company, in the encyclopaedia, Atum, according to the beliefs of the early Egyptians, is a God and it was worshipped.\n\nHowever, trading with the commodities of such a company will not be rendered impermissible because of the name.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf\nDARUL IFTA – JAMEAH MAHMOODIYAH, SPRINGS\n\nJOINT PROJECT WITH DARUL IFTA, MADRASAH IN’AAMIYYAH, CAMPERDOWN"
