  "question": "Can i just pray the Fardh and leave out the Sunnah Salaah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nplease advise - due to time constraints at work is it accpetable to just read the fard salaah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n \nIt is highly discouraged for one to leave out the sunnah salāh. It is generally noticed that when a person becomes continuously negligent in regards to his sunnah salāh, he or she inevitably becomes negligent in his wājib and fard salāhs as well. In lieu of completely abandoning the sunnah salāh due to time constraints, we would rather encourage you to perform it at a quicker pace than your normal salāh and recite the shortest sūrahs of the Holy Qur'ān. It will take no longer than a few minutes. At times one might feel as if he or she is taking much longer; however, this is merely a devilish insinuation attempting to disturb the mind of the worshipper and lead him or her to abandoning salāh.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Yusuf bin Yaqub,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nConcurred by:\n\nMl. Ehzaz Ajmeri,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nDarul Iftaa"
