  "question": "What are the Etiquettes that need to be followed when reciting the Qurâ€™an? (7Qs)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. How should one concentrate on the words, when he is not aware of the meaning? 2. If we run out of breath mid-Aayat, how much do we back-track? 3. While reciting, can we stretch our legs, or rest against a wall? 4. Can we answer someone saying Salaam? 5. Should we respond to sneezes or yawns, by saying Ya-Rahmukullah or Astaghfirullah? How about when the reciter himself sneezes or yawns? 6. Are we supposed to stop AND close the Qur?an when Azaan is being said? 7. Does the Qur?an always need to be read in an ascending order with respect to Surah numbers, during Salaat and general recitation? 8. Do men and women need to keep hair covered? In your response, if you can kindly provide the reference Ahadith (if it exists) for the above questions, it would be greatly appreciated.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. When one is not aware of the meaning of the Qur?aan, then one should concentrate on the words by concentrating on one?s Tajweed and pronunciation of the letters. Furthermore, whilst reciting one should bear in mind that one is reciting the words of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. If we run out of breath in the middle of an Aayat, then on restarting one should merely repeat the last word. This will apply to that person who does not understand the text of the Qur?aan (Arabic). If a person understands Arabic, then he should repeat the Aayat from where the meaning would be complete. (Tas-heel al-Tajweed pg.41)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. While reciting the Qur?aan, it will be Makrooh-e-Tahrimi to stretch out the legs towards the Qur?aan or towards the Qiblah. If a person stretches his legs out away from the Qur?aan or Qiblah or rests against a wall while reciting, it will be permissible if he has any genuine excuse. Yes, there will be no problem in stretching the legs towards the Qur?aan if the Qur?aan is in a elevated position in relation to the reader. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyah vol.1 pg.45)%0D%0A%0D%0A4. The answer to someone?s Salaam will not be Waajib upon the person reciting the Qur?aan, though permissible. (Shaami vol.1 pg.918; HM Saeed)%0D%0A%0D%0A5. It will be permissible to respond to someone?s sneeze by saying ?Yarhamukallaah?, but it will not be Waajib. The same will apply when a person sneezes himself. As far as yawning is concerned, there is no response for it by the listener, neither is it compulsory for the yawner to say anything while reciting the Qur?aan.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. It will be Mustahabb to terminate the recital of the Qur?aan at the time of Adhaan. (Shaami vol.1 pg.399; HM Saeed)%0D%0A%0D%0A7. The Qur?aan needs to be read in ascending order in Salaat only. Not to do so will be Makrooh (undesirable). This is not a condition in general recitation. (Aalamgiri vol.1 pg.78; Rashidiyyah)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
