  "question": "I've noticed that after the Fard prayer, some people place their right hand over their head and recite something. Some do so by placing their hand over their chest(heart). Please explain this action.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome do two in one. (Please explain this in light of a Hadith if one exists).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, there is no prohibition in Shari'ah to place the hand on the\nhead and chest and recite any particular Du'aa after Salaat. Therefore, that\npractice is Mubaah.\n\nThe general principle of a Mubaah act is the person practicing on the act\nshould not regard the act as compulsory by insisting on its practice or\nreproaching others who do not practise upon it. If he does so, that will be\nan indication of the act to be necessary, hence, it will be distortion of\nthe Deen which is Haraam (strictly prohibited).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
