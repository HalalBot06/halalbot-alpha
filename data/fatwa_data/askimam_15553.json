  "question": "I am working in central bank in Finance Department. Is the salary halaal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am working in central bank in Finance Department.\nAs you know that Bank basic earning is interest so my question is that:\nThis salary is Halal for me or not if yes why ? If no why ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nInterest is haram (expressly prohibited) in the Quran and Ahadith. Allah announces war against a person who deals in interest.\n\n \n\nRasulullah (صلى الله عليه و سلّم ) said, “The take of interest, the giver of interest and the writer and witness of interest are equal in sin.”\n\n \n\nAllah says in the Quran, “An do not assist in sin.”\n\n \n\nTo work in a conventional bank which is based on interest is prohibited as that is assisting in sin.\n\n \n\nIf it is possible for you to get another employment which is halal, then you should not work in a conventional bank. If that is not possible, then you may continue your employment at the bank and look for a hala employment. You should make abundant Istighfaar whilst working in the conventional bank.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
