  "question": "With reference to Q6042, during Summer up here in the Northern part of the world, when the time between Isha and Fajr is about 3 hours, when should one offer Tahajjud? www.IslamicFinder.com",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nEven if we sleep right after Isha? it gets to be past 11 pm, and the Fajr time starts at around 3 am. Generally we get up for Fajr, and go right back to bed to make up the sleep. Tahajjud and Ishraq are quite hard to make it. Was wondering what would you recommend for these time zones? In winter it?s quite the opposite. Isha? time starts at 6 pm, and Fajr at 6 am.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn summer, get up and perform Tahajjud a few minutes before 3 a.m. then\nperform the Fajr after 3am.\n\nWe recommend that you may perform your Ishraaq when you get up. Insha Allah,\nAllah Ta'ala will give you the reward of Ishraaq.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
