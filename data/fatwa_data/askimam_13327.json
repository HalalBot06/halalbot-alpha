  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs My Nikah Valid?\n\nAsalam u alaikum, I am a 22 year old hanafi Muslim female and am about to conduct my Nikah with a person of my choice. My parents and family emotionally blackmailed me into accepting a proposal of someone else whom I had refused at first, I said \"yes\" to make them happy as i did not want to hurt them, but I had explained to my mother of my wanting to marry someone else, his parents proposed but my mother refused. She said if my father found out he would really be upset and possibly die of shock therefore i had to keep quiet. Since making the decision I have been disturbed, I made intention to marry someone else and I understand I am allowed to have my choice, and have decided to do Nikah so that i dont fall into haram. I cannot live at home as I feel something overtaking me i constantly feel depressed but at the same time would like my parents to accept the Nikah that I have done. Please advise on the right way to do so so that they will evetually accept this.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe make duâ€™aa that Allah help you and guide you in your predicament.\n\nWe suggest you discuss your issue with some senior person who knows your father, and his temperaments and also has influence on your father.
