  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nis it haram to marry a non virgin girl who had an abortion before and was never married?\nI am a virgin boy myself. the girl im with repents from the sin she did with her ex bf and is now a good muslim and prays five times a day. she is madly and deeply in love with me now and cares for me too much and respects me. I care about her too much and love her as well. and i want to marry her because of two reasons. first reason is since start she has been very honest with me and told me she is not a virgin and  had an abortion before 120 days and second reason is i love her too much.\nI also think, if I back out i will never be able to forgive myself and i would think i am backing out because she was truthful and admitted her sin. If i back out from this girl and what if i marry a different girl and find out the different girl was not a virgin  after i get married to her?i would be devastated and might not be able to forgive myself  for getting rid of this girl i am with (the girl im with who had abortion from his ex bf).\nPlease let me know whether it is haram to marry her. I will do isthekhara.but please brother let me know whether it is haram in Islam to marry her and whther Al Quran says not to marry her.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is perfectly permissible for you to marry the girl, even though she is not a virgin and you are. Her committing abortion also does not affect the validity of the Nikâh. If you are in love with her and you find her suitable for you, you should marry her.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
