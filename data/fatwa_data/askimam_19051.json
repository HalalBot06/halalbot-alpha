  "question": "Breastfeeding is harmful for the mother and the unborn child in our situation. Should we wean off the breastfeeding child or have an abortion?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy wife is 8 weeks pregnant and is breastfeeding our 14-month child.  She wants to continue breastfeeding, but she is unable to take adequate amount of food and fluids due to nausea and epigastria pain, resulting in her feeling very weak.  It is almost impossible here to get some nurse to breastfeed the child.  As a doctor, I understand that this condition is detrimental to the health of all three, i.e. the mother, breastfeeding child, and the unborn child. \n\n \n\nWe understand that, according to the Sharī`ah, mothers are required to breastfeed their children for 2 years.  We also know that a woman cannot have an abortion.  In our condition, which is the better option, to wean off the child or to have an abortion?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\n\n \n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\nThe Sharī`ah does not require the mother to breastfeed for two years.  Rather, it sets the maximum time for breastfeeding as two years.  The Qur’ān clearly mentions that the parents may wean off the child with mutual consultation and agreement, and that there is no harm in doing so.    \n\n \n\nوَالْوَالِدَاتُ يُرْضِعْنَ أَوْلَادَهُنَّ حَوْلَيْنِ كَامِلَيْنِ لِمَنْ أَرَادَ أَنْ يُتِمَّ الرَّضَاعَةَ وَعَلَى الْمَوْلُودِ لَهُ رِزْقُهُنَّ وَكِسْوَتُهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ لَا تُكَلَّفُ نَفْسٌ إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا لَا تُضَارَّ وَالِدَةٌ بِوَلَدِهَا وَلَا مَوْلُودٌ لَهُ بِوَلَدِهِ وَعَلَى الْوَارِثِ مِثْلُ ذَلِكَ فَإِنْ أَرَادَا فِصَالًا عَنْ تَرَاضٍ مِنْهُمَا وَتَشَاوُرٍ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا وَإِنْ أَرَدْتُمْ أَنْ تَسْتَرْضِعُوا أَوْلَادَكُمْ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذَا سَلَّمْتُمْ مَا آتَيْتُمْ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ (البقرة: 233)\n\nThe mothers shall suckle their children for two whole years, (that is) for those who wish to complete the term of suckling…If they decide on weaning after mutual consent and consultation, there is no sin on them…  (Qur’ān 2:233)\n\n \n\nIn your case, since breastfeeding is unhealthy for the mother, the breastfeeding child, and the unborn baby, you and your wife should agree to wean off the child.  It is impermissible and harām for your wife to have an abortion.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\n \n\nMuftī Abrar Mirza\n\nChicago, IL (USA)\n\n \n\nUnder the Supervision of:\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nSouth Africa"
