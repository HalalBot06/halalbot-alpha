  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy father has my credit card- and has a high amount on it. My credit is bad and I am trying to fix it. My husband is mad-and wants me to tell my father to give my credit card back- and stop using my credit card and building charges on it. Every time i confront him- my father says that he will give it back once he pays it off. But it will take him time to do that. I don't know what to do. Please give me some dua to say. Also, my brother doesn't talk to me anymore, he harldy calls- becuase he and his wife are having marriage trouble, and she doesnt get along with my parents. I think they are going to get divorce. The problem is - she works with my husband in the same office. I wish she would go away from there. She doesn't want to talk to any of my brothers family members, including me, except she talks to my husband- since he helped her get a job in that same office. It is bugging me though, what to do? Also, I just found out that my husband and my sisterNlaw have been helping each other out in some stuff- they should't be- since my brother and my sisternlaw are in the mist of divorce. I don't trust my husband anymore after that- I don't know what to do I feel hurt. Also, can you tell me dua to help me get good grades in classes and promotion at work.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for your question.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf you have not given your father permission to use your money, then cancel the card immediately and get a new one. If you have given him permission to use your money but you now find that you are ending up in embarrassment and difficulty, still do the same. You are paying monthly interest on the outstanding amounts. This is totally haram and it affects your life in many ways as Allah Ta'ala is not pleased with any Muslim who takes or gives interest. Put a stop to all purchases on the card and tell your father he is not allowed to use your card anymore. Also tell him to pay off the outstanding balance he owes as soon as possible so that you can get out of paying interest on overdue amounts. You could suggest to him that when you have sufficient funds and if you are in a position to assist him financially, you may do so.%0D%0A%0D%0AI can understand the hurt you experience due to your husband's friendship with your sister in law but I have some suggestions. As far as your marital problem is concerned I suggest that you should ask an Aalim or a learned elder in your community to intervene on your behalf so that you and your husband can be assisted in ironing out your problems. It sometimes helps to get a learned person to guide you personally. You can also think of using the services of a marriage guidance counsellor. There is no point in having suspicion and animosity between you and your husband due to your brother's problems with his wife. I strongly suggest that you concentrate in keeping your marriage sound by trying to build your trust and relationship with your husband. Forget about your sister in law and her actions. Concentrate on what is affecting your marital life. You need to approach your husband with tact, diplomacy and affection. You have too many issues going on at the moment in your life and if you do not concentrate on your marriage you will become stressed out.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is more prudent for a wife to be smart enough to realise that there are many ways in which to win back her husband's attention and love. Fighting and quarreling due to unproved accusations and suspicions just makes things worse for you. Please do try in your sweet way to let your husband know you care very much about him and that he is important to you and that you still love him. Go for outings with your husband and children and seriously start concentrating on your own family. May Allah Ta'ala grant you the sabr and hikmah to overcome this difficulty. Ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0ALet your brother's problems be his problems. If his wife does not want you to have contact with his family, so be it. If they are to divorce then let the elders in the family and community help them. You cannot help them in any way other than by making dua for them. So make sincere dua that Allah Ta'ala softens all your hearts and reconciles your whole family and that reconciliation occurs between all the husbands and wives who are affected in this family.
