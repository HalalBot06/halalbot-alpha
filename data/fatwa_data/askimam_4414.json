  "question": "Now the technology has improved a lot. The muslim dates can be calculated in advance correctly. Then why are the muslim still looking at the moon to confirm the fasting days.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe worst thing is that different countries are celebrating the fasting festival in different days due to uncertainity of moon visibility. Anything can be done to resolve this problem!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the details of your question, your concern is the unity of the\nUmmah during Eid. That is indeed a valid concern and repeatedly addressed by\nmany Ulama, in particular the Arab and Indo-Pak Ulama having two diverse\nopportunities in the matter- technology verses viewing with the naked eyes\nrespectively. It is our dua - whichever way - the prime focus should be the\nunity of our Ummah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
