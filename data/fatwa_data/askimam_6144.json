  "question": "1)Must I make up the missed salats in order? For example, if I missed yesterday's Zuhr, and today's Fajr, can I make up today's missed Fajr before yesterday's missed Zuhr?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have a couple of questions regarding missed salats. I am aware that I must make up these salats, but am confused on how to do it. 1. Must I make up the missed salats in order? For example, if I missed yesterday's Zuhr, and today's Fajr, can I make up today's missed Fajr before yesterday's missed Zuhr? 2. Is there any special way I have to make up these salats? Or is it sufficient for me to just make intention of e.g. \"4 rakat Zuhr Farad kazaa salaat\"? 3. In the past I have missed on occasion some salats which I have not made up. I cannot remember which salats these were, or how many I missed. How shall I make up these salats?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It all depends on the total number of missed Salaat you have to perform.\nIf the total is five or less, the sequence between the missed Salaat is\nimperative. If the total is six or more, the sequence is not necessary.\n2. You will have to specify exactly which Qadhaa you are performing. For\nexample, you make a Niyyah, 'I am performing 4 Rakaat of Dhuhr that I missed\nout last Monday, for instance. However, when you are unable to remember\nwhich Salaats are to be made Qadhaa, you may make the Niyyah thus, 'I am\nperforming Qadhaa of the last Dhuhr missed or the first Dhuhr missed.'\nContinue in this manner until you feel all the Qadhaas are carried out.\n3. You should employ your discretion and err on the side of caution. You may\nuse the method mentioned in answer 2 above.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
