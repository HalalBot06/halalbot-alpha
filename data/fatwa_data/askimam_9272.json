  "question": "deoband was formed when the British were ruling india. They put muftis there to form this group to eliminate the love for our Nabi and fabricate hadiths,and religion to form part of free masons",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI heard from many people that the deoband was formed in INDIA when the British were ruling. They put muftis there to form this group to eliminate the love for our Nabi and fabricate hadiths,and change the religion to form part of the free masons.This is the reason why the tabligh dont speak about the contemporary auliyah and believe they are only going to Jannat.They are in spiritual darkness,there was no 40 days jamaat or Istima in the Nabi's time but it is suddenly fardh now.What is your opinion on this ???????\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhatever you have heard and stated in the question is all incorrect. You should demand substantiation from whomever you heard this.%0D%0A%0D%0ADeoband is one of the villages of the Uttar Pradesh (U.P.) province in India. When the British took control of India, a lot of Muslims from different parts of India opposed them and waged war against them. Amongst them were few scholars from other U.P. villages such as Thaana Bawan and Shaamli like Moulana Qasim Naanotwi (R.A.A.), Moulana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi (R.A.A.), Hajji Imdaadullah Muhaajir Makki (R.A.A.), Hafiz Zaamin Shaheed (R.A.A.), etc. But these personalities did not succeed and hid away when they were pursued by the British and some of them migrated to Makkah.%0D%0A%0D%0AAfter a period of time when matters became calm again, Moulana Qasim Naanotwi (R.A.A.) together with Moulana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi (R.A.A.),%0D%0A%0D%0Afounded an Islamic institution in Deoband named Darul Uloom Deoband. Both these personalities were graduates of Shah Waliullah Dehlawi (R.A.A.)?s institution.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn this institution (Darul Uloom Deoband) they taught and spread the knowledge of the Qur?an, Hadith, Fiqh and other great personalities of Islam. A graduate of this institution Moulana Mahmoodul Hasan (R.A.A.) started a campaign to drive the British out of India which also resulted to be unsuccessful and Moulana Mahmoodul Hasan (R.A.A.), with his few companions, were arrested by the British and locked up in Malta. Moulana Mahmoodul Hasan (R.A.A.) translated the Qur?an whilst in jail. This translation is highly acclaimed in the Muslim world today. %0D%0A%0D%0AThe Ulama of Deoband did not go against the other great personalities but respected them. They also took Bay?at and became Mureeds (followers of a Spiritual Sheikh). They spread the teachings of Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jailaani (R.A.A.), Hajji Mu?inuddin Chishti Ajmeri (R.A.A.), etc. The Ulama of Deoband are against all types of Shirk and Bid?ah (innovations) just as every Muslim person should be, and they encouraged people to practice upon the Sunnah. %0D%0A%0D%0AThe founder of the Tablighi Jamaat, Moulana Ilyaas (R.A.A.) is also a graduate of the same institution. This group is a reformatory group. They encourage the Muslims to reform their actions and strengthen their Imaan which has weakened and caused them to avert from good and turn to evil. In the process they make mention of the sacrifices of the Sahabah (R.A.) and the Religious personalities which are also mentioned in Fazaail-e-A?maal and Fazaail-e-Sadaqaat, so that the desire to do good can once again become a priority in the lives of the Muslims. Three days and forty days are just a method they use to achieve this goal of reformation. They do not regard it as mandatory. To go out in forty days in Tabligh is just like how the Auliyaa used to hold their Mureeds back in their Khanqaas (places of reformation), asking them to engage in certain ?Ibaadaat and refusing them certain lawful things for reformation purposes similar to a patient when he is kept in the hospital and taken care of by keeping him away from things that can be detrimental to his health.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe crux is that the method that the Tabligh Jamaat has adopted of three days and forty days, etc is only for reformation and is not against the Shariah and is not mandatory too. However, experience proves that this method of reformation is more successful and is much similar to the method of our pious ancestors.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Ashraf%0D%0ADARUL IFTA ?
