The other dream is that I saw many people dressed in white climbing stairs , intent on reaching a white house , which was at the top of the stairs.There were white hands , which were detached at the wrists all around the house and these hands came to life and began chasing the people down the stairs. One of these people fell into a hole jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Insha Allah, Allah Ta'ala will save you from any distractions in\nachieving your permissible aims and objectives, Aameen.\n2.
