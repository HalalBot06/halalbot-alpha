  "question": "Can two people who have a blood disorder (e.g. Telecemia \"minor\") get married and should they have children knowing that the children may suffer (Telecemia \"Major\") because of this weak gene?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for two people who are suffering from a blood disorder to marry and it also permissible for them to have children as all orders are in Allah?s hands.\n\nHowever, this is a world of means, cause and effect. If it is established by reliable means and doctors that the offsprings may be infected with the disorder, then it would be advisable for such people to exercise precaution.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
