  "question": "Regarding permissibility of Al-Asr Islamic watch and meaning of names Nuzha and Razmat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Sahab, 1. Can we wear Al-Asr Islamic watch which shows prayer times around the world and also pointing Holy Makkah from any location. Do you have any idea about accuracy of it? 2. What does these name means: Nuzha, Razmat. Jazak Allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is permissible. (Shaami vol.1 pg.431; HM Saeed). These watches are\ngenerally accurate, provided one sets them correctly.\n\n2. Nuzha - chaste, free of faults; Razma (from Razama), a word possessing\nseveral unsavoury connotations, to be cold, weak, thin, to die, etc. Closest\nmatches are: Razamah - a baby's gurgle or croon; Razzaam - a circling lion\n(feminine - Razzaamah).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
