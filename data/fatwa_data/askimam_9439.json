  "answer": "QUESTION\nassalaamu alaykum wr wb. 1). Is acting or role play as a means of teaching people about Islam permitted? 2). When ordering womens undergarments from catalogues we see the awrah of the women displaying them. Is this permitted as there is no way of avoiding the pictures that go with the items. Even in the shops many items come with the photos of the women. 3). If a man is in prison in a cell which he shares with a kaafir and there is a toilet in one corner, can he still do his salah there if the prison does not provide any other place for it? 4). Before mankind was born did our souls meet the souls of the people we will meet in the duniya, especially the soul of the person we will marry? 5). I have read that when a woman dies it is haram for her husband to touch her because their nikkah is broken, but can he at least see her? If this is true then is it haram for a woman to touch her husband if he dies or see him? 6). Is there a dua that can be recited during the ?rest? between the two sajdahs in salah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We do not know what you mean by acting or role play for teaching. Kindly elaborate.\n\n2. It is not permissible for men to see catalogues of women displaying undergarments.\n\n3. If there is no place for a Muslim to perform his Salaat in prison but next to the toilet, he may perform Salaat there.\n\n4. The souls have met one another is the Aalam-e-Arwah (world of the souls). If they were familiar with one another there, that becomes manifest in this world.\n\n5. It is permissible for the husband to see his wife?s face after her death. The same rules applies if the wife predeceases her husband and she sees him.\n\n6. ?Allaahumma ighfir liy warhamniy warzuqniy wajburniy wa aafiniy?. One should read at least ?Allaahumma ighfir liy? (O Allah forgive me)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
