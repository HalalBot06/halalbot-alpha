  "question": "1.Do jinns ever tell us what to do? 2.What is the difference between jinns and devils? 3.Does everyone have a devil/jinn assigned to them? 4.Are all devils locked up in Ramadan? 5.Are ghost real?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta?ala tells us in the Qur?aan that He created Jinn and mankind to worship Him. Jinns are created from fire and have been granted strength and power. Jinns, like humans, are of two categories ? obedient and disobedient.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Shaytaan who disobeyed Allah and refused to prostrate before Aadam [alayhis salaam] was a Jinn. He is also known as a devil. The Shaytaan has vowed to lead others astray. Those who are influenced by the Shaytaan are also Shaytaans. There are two views regarding the locking up of the Shaytaan during Ramadhan. One view is that all the Shayaateen ? big and small - are locked up. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said that every person has a Shaytaan with him who endervours to lead the person astray. Allah has also granted every individual the strength and ability to oppose and go against the endervours of Shaytaan. %0D%0A%0D%0AThe common concept of ghost that it is a form of the dead person has no basis in Shari?ah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
