  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am working in a NGO, the organization name is ‘save the children’, I am an agricultural officer, and our work is to motivate people to sow vegetables. To motivate them we go to people homes and sometimes communicate with men. Our organization is basically from the USA and our salary comes in the form of dollars and my friend say that is a Haraam salary, please guide me as I am unsatisfied by my job. I feel that I have done a great sin. I have not found peace anywhere.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykumwa-rahmatullāhiwa-barakātuh.\n\nAgriculture is commendable and encouraged in Islam.\n\nMany verses of the Quran and Ahadith refer to agricultural activities.\n\n \nAllah Ta’aala says;\n\nأَفَرَأَيْتُم مَّا تَحْرُثُونَ (63)أَأَنتُمْ تَزْرَعُونَهُ أَمْ نَحْنُ الزَّارِعُونَ (64) سورة الواقعة\n\nWell, tell Me about that (seed) which you sow:[56:63]\n\nIs it you who grow it, or are We the One who grows?[56:64]\n\n \nIt is mentioned in a Hadith;\n\nحدثنا قتيبة بن سعيد حدثنا أبو عوانة ( ح ) وحدثني عبد الرحمن بن المبارك حدثنا أبو عوانة عن قتادة عن أنس رضي الله عنه قال\n\n : قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم ( ما من مسلم يغرس غرسا أو يزرع زرعا فيأكل منه طير أو إنسان أو بهيمة إلا كان له به صدقة ) (صحيح البخاري – ج 2 – ص 817 - دار ابن كثير ، اليمامة – بيروت)\n\n“A Muslim who plants a tree or grows a crop, and then, a man, bird or animal eats of it, it will be charity on his part.”\n\nBukhari – vol 2 – pg. 817 – Dar ibnKatheer – Al Yamaama\n\nMuslim – vol 3 – pg. 1189 – Dar Ihyaa Al turaath Al Arabi - Beirut\n\n \n\nYou stated that your work is to motivate people to sow vegetables.This service is Shariah compliant and your salary will also be Shariah compliant.\n\n \n\nWe understand you are a female. If our understanding is correct, then we also take this opportunity to remind you to observe the Shariah laws of Hijab.Cover yourself appropriately and do not interact with males unnecessarily.\n\nPeace lies in conforming to the Sharia at all times and also making the Zikr of Allah.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Hussein Issa,\nStudent of DarulIftaa\nMozambique\n\n \nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
