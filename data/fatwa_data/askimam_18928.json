  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy son was born on August 2,2008 but i want to mention August2,2010 in his Form-B (Birthcertificate) because i intend to make him Hafiz Quran for which i have to cancel his school studies for atleast 2 years. is it permissible for me to do so. Regards Mohammad Irfan Qazi Pakistan\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nAt the outset, it is impermissible to go against the law of the country as long as it is in conformity with Sharia. Therefore, it is not allowed to change the date of birth in the Form B.\n\n \n\nThe Prophet said thrice, \"Should I inform you out the greatest of the great sins?\" They said, \"Yes, O Allah's Apostle!\" He said, \"To join others in worship with Allah and to be undutiful to one's parents.\" The Prophet then sat up after he had been reclining (on a pillow) and said, \"And I warn you against giving a false witness, and he kept on saying that warning till we thought he would not stop. (Bukhari Shareef)\n\n \n\nAfter Hifz, you can send your son for “Catch up Classes”specially designed for Huffaz in Pakistan or alternatively, you may arrange for him private tuitions to cover up in his studies.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl. Abdur Rahman Shareef,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nConcured by: Ml. Abduz Zaman, Student Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nUnder the guidance of:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai Saheb\nDārul Iftā"
