  "question": "My wife masturbated me while we were fasting. Is the fast makrooh or not valid?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSince I climaxed should I refast or would it suffice to make ghusl?What should she do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBy ?climaxed?, we understand that ejaculation took place. In such a case, the husband?s fast has broken. He has to make sincere Tawbah and make Qadhaa of that fast.\n\nThe wife?s fast is valid, but is tainted due to her action. She should make earnest Tawbah for her action. Ghusl was Waajib on the husband, but not on the wife. (Shaami voll.1 pg.404; HM Saeed)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
