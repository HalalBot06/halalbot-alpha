  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)In a case where the husband owes money to the wife,does the wife have to pay zakaat on the money owed annually or is the zakaat paid when she actually recieves the money? 2)Can interest money be used to pay domestic rates? 3)What other ways can interest money be distributed?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The money owed to the wife by the husband is Zakaatable. She could pay the Zakaat annually or when she receives payment.\n\n2. Interest monies must be given to the poor and needy who are eligible to accept Zakaat without the intention of reward. However, interest received from government institutes, eg. post office could be used to offset government taxes. Interest received from private banks cannot be used to offset taxes. It may be used to offset interest charged from the same bank.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
