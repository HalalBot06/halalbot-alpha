  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow many rakath we have to pray in Jumma Namaaz in Hanafi. please also consider the case that here qutba immediatly starts after second adhaan. Do we have to pray fajar sunna even if we are sure that we will miss the fajar jamaath.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If a person comes late to join the congregation for Fajr Salaat and he\nfears missing the Jamaat if he engages in performing the two Rakaats of\nSunnah before Fajr, then he should not perform the Fajr Sunnats. (Tahtawi\npg.245; Qadeemi)\n2. In Jummu'ah Salaat, there are four Rakaats Sunnat-e-Muakkadah before and\nafter the two Rakaats of Jummu'ah Salaat. According to Imaam Abu Yusuf (RA),\nthere are six Rakaats after the Jummu'ah Salaat, four and two. (Ibid pg.213)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
