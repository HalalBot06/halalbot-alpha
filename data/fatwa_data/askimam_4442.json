  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-O-Allaikum, I've heard from a religious woman that for Khula iddat time is 1 month or a woman can do it for 3 months, but for divorce is definitely 3 months. Is it true? or right? please let me know the answer. Allah Hafiz!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe iddat of Khula is the same as the iddat of divorce as khula is also a\ndivorce. The iddat is three months (if not experiencing menses) or three\nmenstrual cycles (if not conceived) or till birth (if conceived).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
