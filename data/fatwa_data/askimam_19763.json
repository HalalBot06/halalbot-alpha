  "question": "My menstrual cycle does not end after precise number of days, when can I start performing salah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nA female gets her monthly cycle on the 7th (for example), it continues normally until 14, for 7 or 8 days. She has no exact precise pattern. However, 70 percent of the time the following is what happens.\n\nOn the 7th or 8th day in the morning she sees a light coloured blood. Then during the day she sees nothing so she does not pray because she thinks it will come back later in the day as it sometimes does. Sometimes she waits the entire day and it comes back at Isha or Fajr the next day, so she is fortunate that she did not take a shower and pray. However, some months she waits the whole day expecting the same thing to happen again (the blood to disappear the whole day or day and a half and then return), but it does not happen, hence she has to do Qadha of the WHOLE day’s prayers.\n\nIn this situation, can you please tell me what is better, every month when blood stops on the 7th or 8th day to take a shower and start praying straight away OR wait the whole day and have a chance of missing Fardh prayers and praying Qadha?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nIf the blood stops on the 7th day, thereafter due to the hesitation regarding the reappearance of the blood, you would have to apply your mind and ponder carefully on the probability of the blood appearing again. After pondering carefully:\n\n\ni) If you feel that the blood will not appear again then it would be permissible for you to perform salah. If the blood does appear again then there would be no sin upon you since you only performed salah after careful deliberation.\n\nii) If you feel that the blood will appear again then you should refrain from performing salah. However, if the blood does not reappear then you would have to make up the prayers missed.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Mohammed Patel\n\nStudent Darul Ifta\n\nZambia.\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
