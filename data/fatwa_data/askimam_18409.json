One should abstain from hiring a church or a church hall for having any functions. These are such places in which the anger and wrath of Allah Ta῾ala descends and it is also a gathering place for the devils. The effect of this environment will befall one by attending them.\n\n \n\nوفي التتارخانية يكره للمسلم الدخول في البيعة والكنيسة ، وإنما يكره من حيث إنه مجمع الشياطين لا من حيث إنه ليس له حق الدخول ا هـ قال في البحر : والظاهر أنها تحريمية ؛ لأنها المرادة عند إطلاقهم.\n  (رد المحتار,سعيد ,ج1,ص380)\nوفي الهندية عن التتمة يكره للمسلم الدخول في البيعة والكنيسة ، وإنما يكره من حيث إنه مجمع الشياطين لا من حيث إنه ليس له حق الدخول ا هـ\n(رد المحتار,سعيد ,ج6,ص387)\n\n\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMl.
