  "question": "Bad behaviour to parents and bad dua! Help!!!i lose my temper.... Is there a prayer that can be said that will make me a better child?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nImam, I have a huge problem. I?m a 17 yr old teenager, and my problem is that my attitude towards my parents is not islamic. I argue with my parents and I lose my temper. I end up repenting, and saying sorry, but I?ve done this a lot of times and I?m sick of it. Is there a prayer that can be said that will make me a better child? (B) The other day my father got mad at me, and he asked Allah to send me to hell, he did this out of extreme anger and did not really mean it, what should be done so that this dua does not happen? I?m extremely worried because even though I?m not the best child at all times, I?ve had my share of nice deeds towards my parents and were it not for my temper and tongue we would always have a great relationship.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nParents are a blessing even if they are difficult. They are your tickets to%0D%0AHeaven literally both in this world and the next.%0D%0A%0D%0AFirstly seek forgiveness from both parents sincerely. Ask them to forgive%0D%0Ayou for every hurt and pain caused to them. Ask them to make positive dua%0D%0Afor you, for your character and for your future especially to change the dua%0D%0Afrom Hell to Paradise. Only dua can change taqdeer. Rememeber Our Creator%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala is Most Merciful continuous in Mercy, a Mercy that we cannot%0D%0Aunderstand, neither possess but we need to make effort to gain the Mercy and%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala has given us hope in the Quraan - \"Do not despair in the Mercy%0D%0Aof Allah Ta'ala.\"%0D%0A%0D%0ASo your father's and mother's deep hearted duas for you will help.%0D%0AFurthermore it will need a deep hearted effort and need from within you to%0D%0Achange. Remember place Allah Ta'ala in front of you. If you take one step%0D%0Atowards Allah, HE will take ten towards you, making your path easy for you%0D%0A(something to the effect). The following should be attempted:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Smile at your parents even if it is difficult to do so. (Remember do it%0D%0Afor Allah Ta'ala, HE will be pleased).%0D%0A2. Wow ! Your parents too will get a shock.%0D%0A3. Greet them and show them kindness morning and evening. Do them little%0D%0Aextra favours. (Remember it's your duty and they don't have to appreciate%0D%0Ait. So don't expect anything in return. Do this for Allah Ta'ala's pleasure%0D%0Aonly).%0D%0A4. When you feel irritated consider how would you feel if your child%0D%0Ascreamed and showed anger to you. Warn yourself .%0D%0A5. Remind yourself, anger is from Shaitaan. When you feel the heat of your%0D%0Aanger developing, walk away, make wudhu, sit down, drink a glass of water%0D%0Athank Allah Ta'ala and if you are sitting lie down, sleep away think of%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala being happy at your efforts.%0D%0A6. If issues need to be addressed, re-think on how to address them politely%0D%0Aand lovingly. Don't expect them to agree, at least your message went%0D%0Athrough. Make dua and leave to Allah Ta'ala your isues. You will see how%0D%0Abeautiful your outcomes will then be. Insha Allah. Sometimes one doesn't%0D%0Aseee this immediately but after a whike this becomes evident.%0D%0A%0D%0ANB Also note aggressive%2F rebellious behaviour sometimes stems from issues%0D%0Anot addressed , anger at some situation, or sometimes you need to deal with%0D%0Ait in your life. Perhaps discuss or address this yourself or with some%0D%0Areliable person.%0D%0A%0D%0AA good dua for beautiful character every time you look in the mirror read%0D%0A\"Allahhumma anta hassanta Khalqi fa hassin Khuluqi.'%0D%0A%0D%0AFor anger read \" Aoozu biltaahi minash shaitaa nir rajeem.'%0D%0A%0D%0AAlso for softness of characyter and removal of difficulties ' Yaa Arhamor%0D%0Araahimee' the amount according to every indiidual (1 time, or 3 times or 100%0D%0Atimes)%0D%0A%0D%0AIstigtaar repentance daily read Astagfirullah 100 times .%0D%0A%0D%0AEnsure you pray your 5 daily salaah and recite some Quraan daily.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala make your path easy.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A2SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
