  "question": "After reciting Surah Fatiha, Imam recited a complete Surah but missed second Ayat of the Surah by mistake. Will Iman have to make Sajda Sahw in this case?.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n2. After reciting a surah, I went into Rukuh without reciting Dua-e-Qunoot in Waajib Witr salaat of Ishaa. Should I make Sajda Sahw for this? 3. While praying behind Imam, should we say Allahu Akbar and Samiallahu Liman Hamidah while doing Sajda and coming up from Ruku or we just keep quiet?.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If one verse from a Surah after Surah Faatiha was missed, that does not necessitate Sajda-e-Sahw.\n\n2. To recite Du?aa-e-Qunoot in Witr Salaat is Waajib. If one forgetfully omitted Du?aa-e-Qunoot, then Sajda-e-Sahw becomes Waajib. If one recites any Du?aa in place of Du?aa-e-Qunoot, that will suffice.\n\n3. It is Mustahabb for a Muqtadi to recite all the Takbeers when changing postures behind the Imaam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
