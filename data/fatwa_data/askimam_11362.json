  "question": "How the saudi king dom oppresses the Muslim people?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn saudi arabia the Kingdom only gives the rights to saudis also I have moved from their and all the people who are pakistani or different country muslims were treated really bad becuase of their background I was wondering since Saudi Arabia is a holy Place shouldnt the Laws Allow Muslims to leave there freely and is it agiasnt Islam what they do specailly black people get treated the worst so yeah thats my question?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nUnfair discrimination against Muslims based on nationality, culture and creed is Haraam. If the information provided by you about bad treatment by the Saudia authorities to non-Arabs, then it is unfortunate and a major sin.\n\nIt is not necessary that all the practices in a Muslim country will always conform to Islamic rules and principles. Anything un-Islamic in a Muslim country cannot be justified and will remain wrong and deserves condemnation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
