  "question": "I cant live with one woman in my life and i have a secret second wife",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am married to a rally nice gaod muslim lady and i love and respect her. However, as a man she doesnt fully understand my needs. I cant live with one woman in my life and am not into Haram inshaa allah. Talked to her about second marriage she was reallly upset and doesnt agree to polygomy. What's in media we all know is that plygomy is only IF there is aproblem with the first wife. people never talk about men's needs (some men at least). Briefly, I knew another woman in another city, She is a decent lady (however christian) we discussed the issue and wrote a marriage contarct and some of my friends and relatives knew that as witnesses. However, am not planning to inform my first wife about it. I do my best to respect her feelings. Also, Itry my best to comfort the second one. I am keen not to commit Haram and am afraid if this (sort of secret marriage is). I pray to God to help and support.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\na) Islam has permitted Muslim men to marry Ahle Kitāb women (those who believe in a divine religion and follow a book that has been revealed). She should not be like the Christians of today i.e. they are Christian by name but in reality, they do not follow any divine religion. However, even though the Nikaah will be valid, it is disliked and there is much harm in that. In the Khilāfah of Umar (Radiyallahu anhu), Umar (Radiyallahu anhu) prevented Muslim men from marrying Ahle kitāb women.\n\n(Fatāwa Hindiyyah, Vol.1, Pg.281, Rashīdiyyah)[1]\n(Fatawa Mahmūdiyyah, Vol.11, Pg.450, Fārūqiyyah)\n\nb) If you honestly feel that you need to take a second wife otherwise you will fall into Harām, we advise you to take a Muslim lady as your second wife other than a lady from the Ahle Kitāb. In this way, your Deen will be protected as well as the Deen of your children (if Allah blesses you with children from that ). You will also be incumbent upon you to maintain equality between the spouses.\n\nc) If you decide to take a second wife and you are sure you will be able to maintain both marriages, the  marriage should not be conducted secretly. In order for the validity of the Nikāh, the Nikāh must be done in the presence of two Shari’ witnesses.\n\n(Hidāyah, vol.2, pg.306, Shirkah)[2]\n\n Rasulullah (sallallāhu alaihi wasallam) has encouraged the Mulims to announce their Nikāhs and have it in the Masājid, as this will also avoid the suspicion of the people.\n\n(Sunan Tirmidhi, Vol.1, pg 207,HM Saeed)[3]\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n\n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftāa\n\n[1]  وكل من يعتقد دينا سماويا وله كتاب منزل كصحف إبراهيم عليه السلام وشيث وزبور داود عليه السلام فهو من أهل الكتاب فتجوز مناكحتهم وأكل ذبائحهم كذا في التبيين\n\n[2] ( ولا ينعقد نكاح المسلمين إلا بحضور شاهدين حرين عاقلين بالغين مسلمين رجلين أو رجل وامرأتين عدولا كانوا أو غير عدول أو محدودين في القذف ) اعلم أن الشهادة شرط في باب النكاح لقوله صلى الله عليه وسلم { لا نكاح إلا بشهود }  \n\n[3]  عن عائشة قالت : قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم أعلنوا هذا النكاح واجعلوه في المساجد واضربوا عليه بالدفوف."
