  "question": "How many minutes after Sunset can we make Iftaar?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe stay in a suburb with no masjid near us. We use the perpetual Sallah timetable to determine salaah times. For Ramadhaan, i was hoping you would be able to tell me how long after the sunset time shown on the timetable, can we make Iftaar. Timetable shows the time of Sunset. Jazakallah hu Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPerpetual Salaah timetables are usually based on Nautical Almanacs which do not accommodate for the extra quarter day every year (resulting in a leap year every four years), there is a slight innaccuracy of a few minutes.\n\nIt is therefore advisable to wait a few minutes (2-4 minutes) before commencing Iftaar and to conclude one's Sehri a few minutes earlier than the times shown on the timetable.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT."
