  "question": "Why is it that tabligh brother aren’t fighting jihad",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nbut jihad {fighting} is fard upon the ummah right now isn’t it. The unislamic governments and the united states attack Muslims every day. I’m sure tabligh is a noble thing but maybe the timing is wrong . Its hard to even go on jammat hearing brothers say that this is jihad and this is the sacrifice of sahaba. I think theirs more sacrifice in jihad . Maybe jammat is different overseas but in the u s it is pretty slack . Also it is to my understanding that each nation should send people out for jihad twice a year does any nation do this? I follow hanbali so isn’t jihad fardz upon me?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWhy the Tabligh brothers are singled out for not engaged in Jihaad? Is every one else engaged in Jihaad? The people in Tabligh are engaged in a noble work. That is appreciated by those who have benefitted from the efforts and sacrifices of the Tabligh effort. Thousands of Muslims around the globe have realised their purpose of being created in the world. They have understood what is obedience to Allah and reformed their lives. They began performing their five daily Salaats. That impacted in all spheres of their life. Their personal and family life became a paradise in this world. When Allah consciousness enters into a life of a person, that person’s focus moves away from this temporary abode to success in the hereafter.\n\nIf Muslims change their way of life and adhere to the Shari’ah, and the Sunnah of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], the non-Muslims and governments will be impressed. We have become targets because we do not practice true Islam. The people around the Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhu] and the pious predecessors observed the way of life of the Sahaaba and the pious predecessors [radhiallaahu anhu] and were impressed. That attracted the people to Islam. Before discussing the issue of Jihaad, it is important to focus on strengthening one’s faith, Imaan and practice. That is being well achieved through the noble work of Da’awah and Tabligh. Join them and see the spirituality in that effort. It is the easiest and most effective recipe to peace and happiness.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
