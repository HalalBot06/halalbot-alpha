  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nman passed away leaving behind both parents, 2 brothers, 1 sister a wife and 3 daughters. How should his estate be distributed\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to the Islamic Law of Succession and Inheritance, distribution of an Estate will only commence after funeral expenses, debts (including legal costs) and bequests (if any) made to non-heirs - which will not exceed one-third (1/3) of the Estate after debts and funeral expenses - have been settled. Thereafter, all assets form part of the Nett Estate and will have to be distributed according to the Islamic Law of Succession and Inheritance.\n\nThe nett Estate will be divided into 81 equal shares and distributed as follows: Wife receives 9 shares, Mother receives 12 shares, Father receives 12 shares and Each daughter receives 16 shares. Sister does not inherit.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
