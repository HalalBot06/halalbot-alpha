  "question": "If a child is born out of wedlock,whose name will the child carry?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) if a child is born out of wedlock,whose name will the child carry(i mean he/she will be bin or binti who? )\n\n 2) in my area there is a mosque near the cementry. and many times there is a janazah prayer after the jumah prayers. do i do my 4 rakaat of sunat muakada prayers(after jumah) first or do i join the janazah prayers which begins immediately after the jumah prayers? and in hanafi janazah prayers do i not lift up by hands for the extra 3 takbirs?\n\n) is bird's nest drink halal. this is the drink made from the saliva of the swallow. people usually drink it for health reasons.\n\nThanks & Assalamualaikum\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf a child is born out of wedlock, then the child will carry the name of the mother.\n\n ( قوله : والولد يتبع الأم في الملك والحرية والرق والتدبير والاستيلاد والكتابة ) لإجماع الأمة ؛ ولأن ماءه يكون مستهلكا بمائها فيرجح جانبها ؛ ولأنه متيقن به من جهتها ولهذا يثبت نسب ولد الزنا وولد الملاعنة منها حتى ترثه ويرثها\n\n(Al-Bahr Al-Raiq Kitaab Al-Itq)\n\n\n\nوعصبة ولد الزنا وولد الملاعنة موالي أمهما ؛ لأنه لا أب له فترثه قرابة أمه ويرثهم\n\n(Al-Fataawa Al-Hindiyah)\n\nIn the Arabic language, bin is used for the son and bint for the daughter, regardless of whomsoever the nisbah (attribution) is made to.\n\nIt would be preferable to make janazah salaah first as there is no qadha for it, whereas the time between jumah and asr salaah is generally lengthy, and the Sunnah Mu’akadah can be performed any time after jumah, not necessarily immediately.\n\n(Al-Hidayah 180/1 Maktaba Shirkat-e-Ilmiyah)\n\nHowever, if delaying the Sunnah Mu'akada affer janazah salaah becomes a                        means of people missing and not performing their Sunnah Mu'akada, then the management would be advised and requested, in a manner which does not offend nor cause dispute, to delay the janazah salaah to after the Sunnah Mu'akada.\n\n(Fataawa Mahmudiyah 565/8 Jamiah Farukiyah)\n\nA person performing janazah salaah in a hanafi manner will only raise his hands in the beginning.  In the extra 3 takbir he shall not be required to raise his hands.\n\n(Al-Ikhtiyar 141/1 Dar Al-Arkam)\n\nKindly provide us with more information on the bird’s nest so as to provide a proper verdict.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
