  "question": "What about visiting a Muslim house which he sells alcohol? His wife is my relative. Do have to cut of her relation?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI know if it's haram, what if he sells his shop what, about his money?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo sell alcohol is a sin. To associate with a sinful person is incorrect as\nthat indicates complacency to the sin. However, if one is able to influence\nthe person on the right path and stop him from the sin, then he should do\nso.\n\nIf it is possible to advise the wife against alcohol so that she in turn may\nadvise her husband, then she should do so.\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
