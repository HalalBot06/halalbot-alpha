  "question": "There is an organization by the name of Hizb u Tahrir. Tell us about the validity of their cause and the work they do.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSahih Aqeedah (correct beliefs) are a necessity of faith (Imaan) and are a definite criterion between Imaan and Kufr. It was for this very reason that %0D%0Athe Ulama had initiated the compilation of Aqaaid 1200 years ago. %0D%0A%0D%0ANowadays, many propounders of Baatil (falsehood) are putting forth their corrupt theories for no reason other than to facilitate fulfilment of their %0D%0Abase desires. By the Fadhl (grace) of Allah, this was long ago anticipated by the Ulama who worked to keep the Aqaaid of Deen pure and unadulaterated. %0D%0AThis latest falsehood being promulgated by the Hizb al-Tahreer is in fact nothing new or unecountered by the Ulama of Deen. Some of the Baatil being %0D%0Apromulgated by them is, in fact the same as originated by the Mu'tazila 12 centuries ago and more recently by the Jamaat Islaami of Pakistan. The Ulama have successfully repelled both these and numerous other attempts to adulterate the pristine purity of Islam and will, Insha Allah, continue to %0D%0Ado so. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best %0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
