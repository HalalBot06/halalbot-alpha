  "question": "On Monday night, I had a dream that a short pious man with beard is willing to marry me.Then I woke up.Actually I am still single, 35 years old & a disabled person. Please interpret for me.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for submitting your question to the institute. You have written about your dream and the fact that you are disabled and single at age 35years.%0D%0A%0D%0ASister dear, please do not read much into your dream. Sometimes if we are preoccupied with certain thoughts during the day, these thoughts play out in our dreams whilst we are asleep. Rest assured that if Allah Ta'ala has written a pious husband in your future, then surely you will meet him. If there is no pious husband or any husband written in your future, then that too, is from Allah Ta'ala. Do not for one moment think that it will be this way because you are a disabled person. Many so called beautiful, rich, able bodied and strong men and women do not get married for some reason or other.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou actually have an advantage over the able bodied persons in that Allah Ta'ala may have given you a visible 'negative' in this world but He has stored treasures for you in the aagirah. It is said that if you carry this disadvantage in this world with sabr, when you see your rewards in Jannah you will think that your disabilty was absolutely nothing. As human beings we do desire to have partners in marriage and we long for the companionship. However, Allah Ta'ala knows best what is good for us and what isn't. He knows best why He puts certain tests before us and all we have to do is accept these with grace and sabr.%0D%0A%0D%0AI suggest you concentrate on performing your five times salaah as perfectly as you can, increase tilaawat of the Quran, zikr, duas and sadqua. Perform Tahadjud salaah and make your appeals to Allah Ta'ala. Do remember, He hears all your pleas and has rewards stored for you which He will deliver to you only when He decides. It is sufficient that you ask and you wait with peaceful serenity. May Allah Ta'ala grant you comfort, peace and your heart's desires, ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A1SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
