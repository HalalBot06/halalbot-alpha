  "answer": "QUESTION\nQ1: Would you be so kind as to list the differences between the Asharis and the Maturidis. I have heard that there are 13 differences between the two schools, but only 6 of these are \"real\" differences. Could you list those six? Q2: Is it allowed for a person to follow the Ashari school in most of the issues and the Maturidi school in some of the issues, or vice-versa?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShaikhul Islam Ibn Kamaal Baasha, has enumerated 12 differences between the Asharis and Maaturidis. We hereunder list 9 of them:(\"A\" refers to Asharis, \"M\" to Maaturidis)%0D%0A%0D%0A1. A- Takween is a Sifat fi'liyyah, is not azali and is haadith.%0D%0AM- takween is from the Sifaat Azaliyyah%0D%0A%0D%0A2. A- Speech (Kalaam) of Allah can be heard%0D%0AM- Kalaam of Allah cannot be heard; what is heard is that which points to it.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. A- Hikmah meaning \"perfection\" is not a quality of Allah%0D%0AM- It is a sifah of Allah%0D%0A%0D%0A4. A- Both the Ridha(Pleasure) and Irada (intention) of Allah is connected to everything.%0D%0AM- The Irada of Allah is connected to everything, not the Ridha%0D%0A%0D%0A5. A- \"Takleef ma laa yutaaq\"(Burdening more than is bearable) is Jaiz%0D%0AM- Not Jaiz%0D%0A%0D%0A6. A-Laws connected to \"Takleef\" can only be received directly from Nass%0D%0AM- Some such laws can be grasped by intellect%0D%0A7. A-Forgiving Kufr is Jaiz Aqlan not Sam'an %0D%0AM- Not Jaiz%0D%0A%0D%0A8. A- Possible for a mu'min to remain in Jahannum forever and for a kaafir to remin in Jannah forever%0D%0AM- Not possible%0D%0A%0D%0A9. A- Being a male is not a condition for being a Nabi%0D%0AM- Being a male is a condition%0D%0A%0D%0AB. If one happens to be a well-grounded alim,who is well-versed in Aqeedah, then it could be acceptable for him to follow another school in some issues. Many famous scholars eg. Razi, Ghazali, Ibn Humaam etc had differences with the school they followed.%0D%0A%0D%0A%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMl.
