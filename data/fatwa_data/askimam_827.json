  "question": "Could we sing national anthem and say the plegde of allegience to the secular state while the flag is being raised up?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nOur school children are forced to attend national school, and every morning they are forced to sing and make the pledge. Muslims religious ulamas in my country also have to make the pledge during national day. Is it a act of blapshemy?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs Muslims, our pledge of allegiance is only to Allah and His Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). However, as Muslims in a non-Muslim state, we are obliged to follow the laws of the country which are not contrary to Shari'ah.\n\nThe allegiance of pledge by singing the national anthem of a secular state which has many un-Islamic laws, for example, legalising homosexuality, lesbianism, pornography, etc. is not permissible.\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
