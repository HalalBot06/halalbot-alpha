  "question": "What is the deep meaning of “Subhaana Rabbi Al-A’laa” and “Subhaana Rabbi Al-Azeem”, that will help me contemplate on the greatness and focus my attention towards Allah S.W.T. during Rukoo and Sujood?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease provide an elaborate and in-depth explanation, not just the translation. Instead of performing a ritual recitation (tasbeeh), I?d like to sincerely praise my Lord (Rabb).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is pleasing to note that you want to sincerely praise Allah Ta'ala. An%0D%0Aeasy way to focus attention towards Allah Ta'ala during Salaat is to%0D%0Acontemplate on the meaning of what is being recited. The Ulama have also%0D%0Amentioned that to carry out every action of Salaat in its proper manner with%0D%0Aease and comfort, enables one to enhance his devotion in the Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn Ruku, one should ensure that his back is straight and the gaze should%0D%0Afall between the feet. When a person is in this posture fully, then he%0D%0Ashould recite the Tasbeeh pondering over its meaning. 'Subhaana rabbiyal%0D%0Aazeem' would mean, 'Glory be to Allah who is my Lord, the Greatest.' Keep in%0D%0Amind the fact that you are bowing down before Allah who is pure and free of%0D%0Aany fault. There is nobody or nothing else that is worthy of bowing down%0D%0Atowards. Allah Ta'ala Alone is the Greatest. Allah Ta'ala is Azeem, i.e.%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala is beyond our imagination, there is no limit to His Greatness.%0D%0AThe entire creation put together with all their technology and intellect%0D%0Awill never ever be able to do justice in explaining His Majesty and%0D%0AGreatness.%0D%0A%0D%0APonder over the rewards mentioned by Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Aregarding Ruku. In one narration, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is%0D%0Areported to have said that when a person stands before Allah Ta'ala in order%0D%0Ato perform Salaat, then all his sins are loaded on top of his head and%0D%0Ashoulders. Every time he bows down for Ruku and Sajda, his sins are being%0D%0Awiped our. Similarly, care should be taken to ensure that in Sajda, the%0D%0Afingers are close to each other and facing the Qiblah. The gaze should be on%0D%0Athe nose. Recite the Tasbeeh, again pondering over its meaning.%0D%0A%0D%0A'Subhaana rabbiyal a'alaa' means Glory be to Allah My Lord, the Most High.%0D%0AHere again, keep in mind the fact that you are in front of Allah Ta'ala and%0D%0Athat you have submitted yourself totally to him Alone because of which you%0D%0Ahave placed the most respected part of your body (your face) on the ground%0D%0Ain prostration for Allah Ta'ala who is the highest and most supreme.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala is al-A'alaa - the most elevated and high, i.e. Allah Ta'ala in%0D%0AHis loftness, Majesty and grandeur is far beyong the highest point that%0D%0Aanyone may think. Allah Ta'ala together with all his qualities is beyond%0D%0Acomprehension. It is impossible for anyone trying to describe the loftness%0D%0Aof Allah Ta'ala to do justice in his description. In Sajda, ponder, you are%0D%0Athe closes that a person can ever get unto Allah Ta'ala as mentioned by Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) in a Hadith. In another Hadith, Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said that every time one%0D%0Aprostrates in Sajda to Allah Ta'ala, then Allah elevates his status in%0D%0AJannah and wipes out a sin from his record.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0Afor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
