  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf i will go and perform umrah for 10 days, according to hanafi after tawaf and saé should i shave my head the first i perform umrah or the last day?  Do i need to have ihraam for all 10 days? \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nUmrah is to perform  Tawaaf and make Saee in the state of ihram. Once that is completed perform two Rakaats Salaat which is compulsory after making Tawaaf. Now the Umrah is completed you could shave your hair and remove your ihram and don normal clothing. You do not have to wear the ihram towels for the full duration of your stay.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
