  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu %C1laykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'If one person is guided through you, it is better than red camels (precious commodity).' %0D%0A%0D%0ATo invite and convert any non-Muslim to Islam is indeed very rewarding, whether the conversion is dependant of one's motive, for example, marriage or independent. However, since there is more sincerity in an independent motive, the reward will be greater. Furthermore, we wish to advise that there is a great reward in converting a non-Muslim to Islam by virtue of marriage but one must also exercise extreme precaution in doing so. The conversion should not be for marriage convenience.%0D%0A%0D%0AThat is generally manifested when the marriage breaks down. The person renegades and goes back to their previous religion. The consequences of reneging is very dangerous. Therefore, the person should be explained what Islam is and be motivated to practise Islam permanently.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta%E3la Knows Best.%0D%0A%0D%0AWas salaam%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
