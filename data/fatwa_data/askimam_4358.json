  "question": "What if the wife wishes to stay with her mum now and then?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs-salaaamu-alaikum, I am about to enter nikkah shortly. A question was raised between us that at times she may want to stay with her mum. Am I obliged to stay over as well? Is it wrong for me to make her stay with her mum infrequent. What are her duties and responsibilities as a wife towards my parents and family? Please explain as fully as possible as we would like to gain closure on this. Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMarriage is all about love, understanding and mutual co-operation between%0D%0Athe spouses. The greater the love, the more the facilitating nature of the%0D%0Aspouses manifests itself. The husband and wife must make adjustments and%0D%0Arise above their emotions and go beyond strict principals to maintain that%0D%0Alove and harmony. Adherence to strict principles in such an intimate and%0D%0Aclose relationship may not be practical. In view of the above, the husband%0D%0Ashould facilitate his wife's requests to permit her to stay with her%0D%0Aparents. He should offer to stay with her there. That is conducive to%0D%0Amaintaining a good relationship with ones in-laws. It is not an obligation.%0D%0ASimilarly the wife has no Shari obligations to her in-laws. She does not%0D%0Ahave to serve them. However, she should do so as a good gesture and%0D%0Amagnanimity from her side. That attitude displays humility and humbleness.%0D%0AThe husband will be pleased by his wife serving his parents and so to will%0D%0Athe wife be pleased by her husband serving and being good to her parents.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn brief, it is mutual understanding and co-operation between the spouse to%0D%0Aserve and service one another's feelings.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
