  "question": "is a marriage valid without ones parents permission,although one has an imam and 2 witnesses. (done secretly) shukran.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ: I am proposed to a girl. Our families want us to marry only next year. Since we are seeing each other, can we perform a secret marriage to avoid committing adultery and officially marry next year?%0D%0AA: Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised, ?Announce the Nikah.? (Mishkaat pg.272; Qadeemi) The wisdom behind the announcement is to avoid any misconception of an illegal and illicit relationship between the boy and girl. Although the first and secret marriage for the purpose of legalizing intimacy will be valid, but we are also advised to abstain from doubt and disgrace. If the Nikah is not announced, people witnessing the relationship will regard the relationship as Haraam and illegal. Furthermore, what if the girl conceives and gives birth before the official ?second? marriage? The negative factors surrounding that as well as the child for the rest of his%2Fher life are well known. Therefore, we advise that if there is a dire need to fulfil one?s desires, the Nikah be expedited to avoid the abovementioned negative factors of a secret marriage.%0D%0A%0D%0AA Nikah is performed with a proposal (Iejaab) by the male or female and acceptance (Qubool) by the male or female in the past tense and in the presence of two male Muslim witnesses (Hidaaya vol. 2).%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is Sunnat that the marriage be announced and performed in the Masjid and the bride be represented by her Mahram (father, brother, etc.). The bride gives consent to her representative (Wakeel) in the presence of two witnesses to perform her marriage at the Masjid. At the Masjid, the Wakeel represents the bride in the presence of the two witnesses and the stipulated dowry. The witnesses must be two trustworthy and pious male Muslims who are not her ascendants e.g. father, grandfather or decendants e.g. son, grandson, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Mahr (dowry) is the woman's right and should be stipulated prior to the marriage.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
