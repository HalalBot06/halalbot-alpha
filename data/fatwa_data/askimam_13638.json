  "question": "Why is that so that we didn’t find any SYED in the Arab family and it is most commonly found in our sub-continent?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question is that I have heard that Prophet Mohammad didn’t allow himself and his family to accept any form of Zakat and Khayraat. This seems to follow by lots of muslim in our sub-continent that people who link themselves to the family of Prophet (called themselves SYED) don’t accept any form of Zakat thing.\n\n What is the authenticity about this thing? Can you check in the books of Fiqh and let me know.\n\n Why is that so that we didn’t find any SYED in the Arab family and it is most commonly found in our sub-continent?\n\n With sincere regards\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is true that Zakaat and Sadaqah is prohibited for Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and his family. Abdul Muttalib ibn Rabee [radhiallaahu anhu] narrates that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Verily this Sadaqaat is the dirt of people and it is not permissible for Muhammad and for the family of Muhammad [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam].’ (Muslim)\n\nIt is possible that we do not know of Syeds in the Arabs as we do not live among them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
