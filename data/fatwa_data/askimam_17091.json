  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI had bought a clothing and later discovered that it has name of Allah and Rasul salalahu alai wasalam on it . I had worn it a few times as well. What must I do with it. How do I compensate for the wearing of it?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n Assalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is from the quality of a believer that he has the utmost respect for the name of Allāh and his Prophet (Sallallāhu ‘Alayhi Wasallam). The cloth which contains the name of Allāh and his Prophet (Sallallāhu ‘Alayhi Wasallam) deserves to be respected and should be utilized in a manner in which no disrespect is shown. It may be used as a cover to for the Qur’ān or other religious books.\n\nAs for the few times it was used as a normal cloth, then this was not done intentionally. Nevertheless, seek repentance to Allāh for whatever disrespect that might have occurred.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Ehzaz Ajmeri,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nConcurred by:\n\nMl.
