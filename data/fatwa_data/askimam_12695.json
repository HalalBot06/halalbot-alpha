  "question": "If a married man goes to a prostitute for a masturbation, is it equivalent to prostitution? How can a person should ask for forgiveness in that case?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is definitely an extremely major sin for the married man, rather for any man to approach another woman for such lewdness.\n\nIn order to be redeemed from this sin, the individual has to sincerely repent to Allah by firstly abstaining from the sin, regret having committed it and solemnly resolve not to return to that sin in the future. By doing this, Insha Allah he will be pardoned by Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf\nDARUL IFTA ? JAMEAH MAHMOODIYAH, SPRINGS\n\nSPECIAL PROJECT WITH DARUL IFTA"
