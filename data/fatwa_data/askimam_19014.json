  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nplease let me know about the zakath of gold.  my wife have gold more than the nisab amount . and she is not using even 25grms. so should i pay zakath for all the qty or except 85grms. \n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIn principle, zakat will become compulsory on ones wealth when it reaches or exceeds the nisab provided that this amount of wealth remains in ones possession for the duration of one entire lunar year.\n\nThe nisab is 20 Mithqals (87.479 g) for gold and 200 Dirhams (612.35 g) for silver.\n\nTherefore, after reaching either the nisab or its value, your wife will have to discharge 2.5% of the entire gold whether she is using it or not.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl. Abdur Rahman Shareef,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nConcurred by: Ml. Abduz Zaman, Student Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nUnder the guidance of:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai Saheb\nDārul Iftā"
