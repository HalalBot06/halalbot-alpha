  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs oral sex haram in shafi madhab? Can you provide any authentic hadith or ayat banning it? I mean I have read your answers and answers of lot of other scholars but nobody says it is haram. Also, please include the back private part for oral sex.\n\nIs the use of condoms allowed in Islam. I would require to do travelling and hence feel that it would not be feasible to have a child as it would lead to discomfort for the wife and child.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1.      Every form of oral sex is prohibited. There is no difference in the ruling between the front and hind parts. Sex is a human need and natural. However Shariah has emphasized on shame and modesty.\n\nRasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم    ) said, “Shame is a (big) branch of Deen”.\n\nRasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said, “Ieman and shame are colleagues. When one is lifted the other is also lifted.”\n\nHadhrat Ayesha (RA) said she and Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) did not see the private parts of each other. This hadeeth is clear regarding the modest manner in fulfilling ones base desires.\n\n2.   S/A birth control.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nCONTRACEPTION\n\nReversible\n\nChemical - the pill which is taken orally spermicidal jellies used locally. Mechanical - use of condom intra-uterine device Physical - coitus interruptus rhythm method Permanent - sterilization operation - tubal ligations - vasectomies.\n\nQuestion 1\n\nIs the Practice of contraception allowed in Islam? If so, under what circumstances?\n\nAnswer\n\nContraception is permissible on a limited scale for valid reasons - reasons considered by the Shariah to be valid. The circumstances which will permit reversible and permanent contraception differ.\n\nREVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTION\n\nAmong the reasons accepted by the Shariah as valid for practising reversible contraception are:\n\n(A) Physical weakness.\n\n(B) Sickness.\n\n(C) The wife maintaining her beauty or figure for the sake of her husband.\n\n(D) The couple being on a journey or in a distant land.\n\n(E) Adverse political conditions, e.g. children are forcibly separated from their parents as is advocated by communism; etc.\n\n(F) The couple decide to separate in the near future.\n\n(G) The wife is an immoral person.\n\nThere are valid grounds for practising reversible contraception. Poverty or the fear of poverty are not valid reasons for contraception. It is not permissible to practice contraception on account of a fear of not being able to provide for a large family. Such a fear is an attribute of non-Muslims. According to the Qurمn Shareef: 'There is not a living creature, but its sustenance is the responsibility of Allah.'\n\nSimilarly desire to curb sexual desire which may stem out of piety is not a lawful ground for contraception. If practised for any reason which is unlawful in Islam, then contraception will likewise be unlawful, e.g. for indulgence in illicit sex.\n\nPERMANENT CONTRACEPTION\n\nPermanent contraception is permissible only if the woman's life is in danger or her health is seriously threatened."
