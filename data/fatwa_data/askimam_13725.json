  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nOne of my uncles has been attending a zikr programme in USA, wherein they close the lights and say Allah Ho through their noses. He feels it to be strange and have reservations about attending such practices. Through Allah's grace and Ulama's hard work, I already know of the tremendous benefits of Zikr, both collective and individual.\n\nBut this particular practice of reciting Allah ho through noses, does not sound to me to be as part of Zikr as ordained by Allah and our beloved Prophet (may Allah's peace and salaams be upon him).\n\nMy queries are\n\n1) Is it okay to attend such programmes.\n2) If there is doubt in my uncle's heart, then what should he do ? Since he has already spoken to a few people about this but still has doubts in his heart. What should he do to remove the doubt from his heart, if these programmes are infact beneficial.\n\nJazaak Allah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe Qur’aan-e-Kareem and Ahaadith are replete with the order of Dhikr. There are also many virtues for Dhikr. Some forms of Dhikr, for example, individual and collective, soft and loud are mentioned in the Ahaadith. There is no restriction for other forms of Dhikr and such forms will be regarded as Mubaah (permissible) if one does not regard them to be compulsory.\n\nAt most, the different forms of Dhikr are like a doctor’s prescription which is tested, tried and proven beneficial. These prescriptions are permissible and no one condemns the use of such medicines. Similarly, it is permissible to follow the Dhikr prescription of a spiritual doctor and guide to maintain one’s spiritual self. The most important thing is that the spiritual guide must be reliable. He must be a person who is Allah fearing and adheres to the Sunnah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
