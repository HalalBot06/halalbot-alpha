  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. If I have prayed asar and decided to perform umrah later, is it allowed to pray the 2 rakat of umrah after asar prayer? 2. Is it allowed to perform sajda-e-tilawat after fajr (before dawn) and after asar pryer?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe 2 Rakaats of Umrah should be performed after the Asr Salaat.
