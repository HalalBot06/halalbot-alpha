  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am a student overseas in a non-muslim country. In the masjid where I pray (this is the only masjid in the city), they are praying only 8 raka'ats of salah for Taraweeh, but very slowly and with Qirraat. I follow the Hanafi madhab and hence tried last year to make up the rest of the salaat (12 rakaats), but due to the study load at school, I couldnt complete all 20. So unfortunately there isnt enough time to pray once I get home since they read the congregation salaah very slowly. I know it isn't ideal, but to balance my studies, as a matter of need, can I just pray 8 raka'ats with them.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIf there is not enough time to make up the rest of the twelve rak’ahs after coming home, then you and a few other Muslims with similar concerns should pray your own tarāwīh of twenty rak’ahs.  You can recite whatever sūrahs you have memorized and do not need to complete the entire Qur’ān.  This way, you will pray all twenty rak’ahs of tarāwīh in congregation in the same time as it takes to read the eight rak’ahs in the Masjid.\n\nIf you cannot find others to join you in congregation, you may pray ‘Ishā’ and as many rak’āhs of tarāwīh in the Masjid as time permits, and complete the rest by yourself at home in the same time at it would take to read all eight rak’ahs in the Masjid. \n\nFurthermore, please note that if you can pray the eight rak’ahs in the Masjid, then you do not need to complete the rest of the twelve right away.  If it possible for you to pray the rest of the twelve at home, but spread out throughout the night, then you should adopt this method, rather than praying the whole tarāwīh alone by yourself. \n\nFinally, Ramadān is a special, limited time of the year.  We should be ready to sacrifice extra time and energy during this month for the pleasure of Allāh Ta’ālā.  InshāAllāh, if you take out extra time for the sake for Allāh Ta’ālā and the sunnah of His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم, you will find barakah (blessings) in the rest of your time. \n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
