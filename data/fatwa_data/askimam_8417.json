  "question": "Q1 : A person living in Paradise, will do so for an eternity (forever). I keep getting these waswaas, worries....will the inhabitants of Jannah get bored there?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nQ1 : A person living in Paradise, will do so for an eternity (forever). I keep getting these waswaas, worries....will the inhabitants of Jannah get bored there? It is human nature (in this Dunya) that we get bored of doing the same thing, over a period of time. What about in Jannah? Q2 : Allah Has promised the believers, that He has prepared for them, in Jannah, what no eye has seen, no ear has heard of, and what no one has ever imagined. Does this apply to each and every inhabitant of Jannah, including the one with the lowest status in Jannah? Q3 : Obviously, people in Jannah will have individual positions and status, i.e. not everyone will have the same reward, since some were undoubtedly more pious than others. So, will the ones with less reward be jealous, or unhappy, that they have less reward? Q4 : Are the rewards for the Ahlul Jannah infinite? If so, is this for each and every inhabitant of Jannah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Allah Ta?ala mentions in the Qur?aan (Surah Faatir, Aayat35), ?Our Rabb has settled us in an eternal home by His grace. Here no difficulty will ever afflict us, nor shall any tiredness touch us.? From this Aayat, we gather that the boredom is a sign of difficulty and tiredness and obviously in paradise there is no such thing.\n\n2. It is narrated in Tirmidhi (Hadith2562) that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?The least rank for a person in Jannah is that for him will be 80,000 servants, 72 wives and tent from the pearls will be erected for him like the distance between Jaabiyah and Sanaah (2 places name). If this is what is for the one in the lowest stage, is he still going to worry about what the others have.\n\n3. The rewards for the dwellers of Jannah will be infinite.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
