  "question": "I heard that it is not obligatory for a Muslim woman to perform her prayers at the Mosque. Does this include Jumuah (Friday) prayers?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA male should perform his Salaat with Jamaat in the Masjid. Salaat with Jamaat in the Masjid is 25 times superior than Salaat performed at home. The Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) admonished men reading Salaat in the Masjid. Women should read Salaat individually in their homes. The Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, \"The Salaat of women in the inner part of their house is more virtuous than the Salaat made in the general part of the house.\" (Mishkat) However, if a male Mahram for some legitimate Shar'ee reason did not read his Salaat in the Masjid, he may read his Salaat with the women of the house (mother, sister, wife, etc.) with Jamaat provided the women stand behind the male. It is Makrooh for females to read their Salaat with Jamaat. Every female should read her Salaat individually. The females should not lead their own Jamaat or follow the males Jamaat. It is permissible for the females to read their Salaat individually while the males read their Salaat separately with Jamaat. It is reported from Hadhrat Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu) saying, \" woman must not lead the Salaat.\" Therefore, it is incorrect for a woman to lead the Salaat and for the other females to follow. We find this practice was not encouraged (that women make their own Jamaat) at the time of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). There is no reported incident of women leading the prayer during the time of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and during the period of the Khulafaa-e-Raashideen. Salaat is a means of earning the Mercy and Blessings of Allah Ta'ala. It should therefore be performed in the best manner possible. However, to deliberately indulge in an act of Makrooh-e-Tahrimi is to earn the displeasure of Allah Ta'ala. These two aspects therefore cannot be reconciled. And Allah Ta'ala Knows Best.
