  "question": "Is anal sex permissible between husband and wife?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI read in a book, which mentioned all the actions necessitating a fard bath(ghusl), and one of them were anal sex. Does this mean it is permitted in islam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is reported from Ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that Hadhrat Umar%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhu) had intercourse with his wife through rear entry (not%0D%0Aanal entry). Later, he was overtaken with the thought that perhaps he had%0D%0Acommitted an undesirable act. Immediately, he rushed off to the Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) calling out, 'I have been destroyed, I have%0D%0Abeen destroyed!' He was asked what was the matter, to which he recounted his%0D%0Afear of having committed an undesirable act. The prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) remained silent, giving no answer. Sometime later, these Aayaats%0D%0Aof the noble Qur'aan were revealed: 'Your wives are a tillage (farm) unto%0D%0Ayou, thus approach your tillage from wherever you wish.' (Baqarah Aayat223).%0D%0AThereafter, the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) explained the meaning%0D%0Aof the Aayat by saying that, 'Intercourse in the Vagina is permissible in%0D%0Aany position which one desires to adopt.' From the front or rear, so long as%0D%0Aintercourse during menstruation and anal sex does not take place, for these%0D%0Aare Haraam. (Tafseer Fathul Qadeer; Shawkaani).%0D%0A%0D%0A%3EFrom the above, we understand that the husband may approach his wife from%0D%0Athe front, sides or rear whether in a supine position or squatting, all are%0D%0Apermissible, as long as intercourse takes place in the vagina, and not in%0D%0Athe anus.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
