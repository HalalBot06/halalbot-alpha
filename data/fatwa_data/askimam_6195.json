  "question": "If the husband doesn't pray and doesn't go to the mosque. Does the wife have the right to a divorce?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn 3 yrs.of marriage he's only prayed once in a while. He's only gone to the mosque for the Friday pray approx. 15 times after much pushing by me. I'm tired of this I want my home to be Islamic. Can I divorce him? May Allah bless you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari'ah, only the husband has the right of divorce. The\nwife does not have the right of divorce.\n\nIn your situation, we advise you apply wisdom and make your husband perform\nSalat and be Shari'ah compliant. Your success will depend on your approach\nand wisdom behind changing him. There are many women who have successfully\nchanged their husbands and made them adhere to Shari'ah. You should be\nsteadfast and never give up your efforts in achieving your objective. If you\nfeel that informing your husband of your intention to terminate the marriage\ndue to his un-Islamic behaviour may be useful in chaing him, you may try\nthat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
