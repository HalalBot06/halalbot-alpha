  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy nephew is studying Hifz. He has a problem - he memorises in the evenings but my morning he has forgotten everything. He is very keen to become a Hafiz but due to this problem is becoming very despondent. Please make dua for him and if possible let me have wazifas and taweez. Please therefore answer to my question no 4936 is now urgent. Salaams and may Allah bless you for all you good work\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMemorizing the noble Qur'aan is definitely a gift from Allah Ta'ala. He\nchooses whosoever He wishes, therefore, your nephew should not become\ndespondent and carry on putting effort towards this achievement. We suggest\nyour nephew be given some guidance in the procedure of memorizing his\nlessons. The correct procedure also has much to do with the success in Hifz.\n\nA person memorizing the Qur'aan is acquiring Noor (light) in his bossom.\nHence, one should totally refrain from all such actions which Allah Ta'ala\nprohibited whereby the Noor is not lost because of sinning.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
