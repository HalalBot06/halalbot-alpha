  "question": "What is the ruling regarding the use of coil as a contraceptive? sometimes when a coil is placed then there is a chance of najasat",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1.  A female falls in the catogory in which using contraceptives is allowed. What is the ruling regarding the use of coil as a contraceptive? sometimes when a coil is placed then there is a chance of najasat i.e mentrual blood or discharge to remain in the uterus or arount the coil.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the event of a female using the coil or loop as a contraceptive, two possibilities exist:\n\n1. It may prevent fertilization by destroying the sperm and the ovum prior to their interaction.\n\n2. If fertilisation takes place, the fertilised ovum is expelled from the uterus by the coil. This expulsion takes place within one or two weeks after fertilisation.\n\nIn the first case where the coil acts as a preventative measure against fertilisation, it is similar to any other contraceptive thus rendering it permissible in the Shari’ah in cases of individual needs like the woman suffering such severe sickness or weakness during pregnancy which may endanger her health. In the second case, the coil is a means of expelling the fertilised ovum from the uterus after conception. Therefore, it acts as a device to effect an abortion, thus rendering it impermissible to use in the Shari’ah.\n\nSince both possibilities exist, i.e. no fertilisation takes place, fertilisation takes place thereafter the fertilised ovum is expelled, it will not be permissible to use the coil as a means of contraception especially where there exist other permissible means of contraception. (Contemporary Fataawa pg.135).\n\nAs for the issue regarding menstrual blood or discharge remaining in the uterus or around the coil, this in no way effects the Mas-alah of using the coil, nor will the woman be regarded as impure in the Shari’ah. The only time she will be regarded as impure is when blood or discharge flows to the external body.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
