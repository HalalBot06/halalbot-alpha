  "question": "Is Bayt from a Shaikh necessary for every muslim to enter Jannah ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am staying in a Barelvi's deominated area. It is a common belief among Barelvi to take a Bayt from a Peer/Shaikh that on the day of judgement , the Peer will recommend you to his superiors and so on to the last Prophet Mohamed S.A.W. to enter you in Jannah. What is your opinion on such belief ?\n\nI do also listen Bayans of Tablighi Ulema like M.Tariq Jameel / M.Saad / Ahmed Laat and other Deoband Ulema who also took Bayt from Superiors. Is it necessary to take Bayt for every muslim ? Whose name (Ulema) you suggest to take bayt in India.\n\nJazakallah Kher \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh  \n\n1. It is Waajib (necessary) upon every muslim to refine his character, correct his beliefs and in brief, live a life according to Shari’a. This could be attained in many ways such as studying under a teacher, sitting in the gatherings of the pious, taking bay’t to a Shaykh etc. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyya, vol 4, pg 405/414, Farooqiyya)   \n\nHowever, it has always been the divine scheme of Allah Ta’ala that perfection cannot be attained without an expert instructor. Thus, if one intends to lead a life perfectly according to Shari’a, he should submit himself to the guidance and care of an expert instructor in this field i.e. Shaykh. This in essence is known as Bay’t.\n\nIf a person feels that he has the ability to lead a life perfectly according to Shari’a, by simply studying under a teacher, researching etc, he may do so. However, experience proves that the most effective method to lead a perfect way of life is to submit oneself to the guidance and care of a Shaykh. Many of our Aslaaf (pious predecessors) despite been high authorities of Islamic knowledge, felt the necessity to submit themselves to a Shaykh and take bay’t.\n\nIn fact, bay’t is established in the Quraan and the Ahadith.\n\nAllah Ta’ala mentions: “Indeed, Allah was pleased with the believers when they gave the bay’t to you (Oh Muhammad sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) under the tree”.(Al-Fath 18)\n\nIt is recorded in Sahih Al-Muslim that Auf bin Malik Al-Ashja’ee said: “We were with the Prophet (Salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam), seven, eight or nine of us, when he said: Will you not make bay’t to the Prophet (Salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam)? We stretched our hands and enquired: On what should we make bay’t to you, Oh Prophet of Allah? He said: That you make the ibaadat of Allah, associate nothing with him, perform the five salaat and you listen and obey.” (Shari’a and Tasawwuf, vol 1, pg18)\n\n2. Bay’t in itself is not a license for entry into Jannat. There were pious people of the past who did not take bay’t. This does not mean they will not enter Jannat.\n\n3. There is no proof in Shari’a to support the claim that by taking bay’t, the Shaykh will recommend you to his seniors and so on up to the Prophet (Salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam) to enter you into Jannat. Yes, in general, the pious will be allowed to intercede on the Day of Qiyama, but not necessarily in the manner stated in the query. (Mirqaat Al-Mafateeh, vol 10, pg 281, Imdaadiyya)\n\n \n\nوكذا لغيره من الأنبياء والأولياء والعلماء والشهداء والصالحين والفقراء بعد ذلك شفاعات متعددة في ادخال بعض المؤمنين الجنة بلا حساب وادخال بعضهم الجنة (مرقاة المفاتيح ج10 ص281)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
