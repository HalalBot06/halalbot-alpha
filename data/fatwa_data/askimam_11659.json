  "question": "What impression do you think non-Muslims will have of Islam after reading this web-page?Do you view me, a “kufar”, as inferior in some ways? Would I have less rights in an Islamic state?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHello I am a young, non-Muslim man living in Europe, with ?western values.? I have some questions I hope you will find the time to answer. 1. Many non-Muslims who come to this site will doubtless grow more fearful and hostile toward Islam because of some of your answers. Does this concern you? 2. I have spoken to several Muslims about this page and the answers you give. They say that you do not represent true Islam, that you put to much importance on the Hadiths and interpretations made by earlier authorities, instead of the Quran, and that you understand everything the worst way. How do you respond to this? 3.Do you view me, a ?kufar?, as inferior in some ways? Would I have less rights in an Islamic state?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMay Allah guide us all.%0D%0A%0D%0AI thank you for your openness and reverting to me directly instead of relying on comments from others. You enquire if my answers will create hostility towards Islam and if that concerns me.%0D%0A%0D%0ADear Kristian, if a person serves for the pleasure of Allah and tries his level best to present Islam in its pristine form, then he should not be concerned. The true following of Islam requires complete submission and going against one?s desires. The dislike of some of my answers confirms to me that the true message is being presented. The prophet [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] advised that if a person pleases Allah whilst people are displeased with him, Allah will suffice for that person. The alternative for me is to convey Islam that suits people. That will be misrepresentation of Islam and I will be guilty in the court of Allah. In such a situation, no one will avail and rescue me against the curse and punishment of my Allah to whom I owe everything ? my life and my death and everything else.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt will be interesting to know the Islamic qualifications of those that have commented on my responses. If there is a true academic, I will be happy to engage on an academic discussion on any of my response. It will be interesting to know the outcome only after witnessing such an academic engagement. If am I proven wrong, I will openly retract and accept any correction. My purpose is to serve Allah and not my desires.%0D%0A%0D%0ADear Kristian, no human being is inferior. Every one is the creation of Allah. Virtue is only through Allah consciousness and true submission. I view you to be a noble person in the pursuit of truth.%0D%0A%0D%0AYours for dedication in Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
