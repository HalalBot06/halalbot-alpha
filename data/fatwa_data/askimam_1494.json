  "question": "Asalaam u alai kum Is kaza (late) namaz not allowed in Islam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was having a discussion with my older sister, she brought up the subject that kaza (missed/late) namaz is not allowed in Islam. My sister received this idea from the ustani(the person she takes her kids to read quran to). I disagree with her, I believe that kaza namaz is allowed in Islam, and also that Rasullalah (saw) had read them himself. Am I write or wrong? Please show verses from the Qu'ran or show me some hadith to prove me write/wrong. Jazak Allah khair. Salaam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOne should make an effort to perform his/her fardh salaats timeously.\nHowever, if one missed his/her Salaat due to unforeseen circumstances, then\nqadhaa Salaat must be made for the missed Salaat. If one did not make qadhaa\nof the missed Salaat throughout his/her life - a bequest of fidya\n(compensation) for each missed Salaat must be made before death. A person\nwill be sinful for not making qadhaa of the missed Salaats.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT"
