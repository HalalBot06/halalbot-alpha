  "question": "1) Investment Banking 2) Fasting in the month of Dhul Hijjah 3)Piercing Ears 4)Making up for missed fasts",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)Is Investment Banking halal, if there is said to be no interest involved? I am not very well versed with business matters in the light of Islam, hence the qs. 2) What is the Fadhilah or Significance of fasting for the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah? 3)Is it permissible to have MORE than one pierce in each ear lobe for women? 4)I have been missing fasts evry year since i started menstruating (which wasnt until a few years back) and i never managed to make them up during the course of the years. Now, i am very serious about making them up, because i fear the wrath of Allah may come upon me and also duas are not accepted when the faraidh are not complete. so i have calculated that i have to make up 30 fasts in total. now, the thing is that i am physically capable but can i give the money in compensation as this will be quicker and easier for me. then along with that i can also make up the fasts at my own pace. so there are 2 questions here: a) is the above solution permissible to a healthy teen like me? b) how much is the compensation per fast: 1 meal or 2? I am sorry for having submitted so many qs!!! But you are rendering a great service to our Ummah, which is in dire need of it. Jazakallah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Investment banking is permitted provided the investment meets the Shar?ee requirements. We are unable to comment on Amro Bank as we are not aware of their Shar?ee status. Why don?t you ascertain where the money is invested and on what basis the profits are calculated, etc. Do they have a Shari?ah board monitoring their activities?\n\n2. It is Mustahabb (desirable) to fast on the first 9 days of Dhul-Hijjah. There are a host of virtues in observing Nafl fasts.\n\n3. Since the second whole is generally pierce for style or fashion, it is not permissible to pierce more than one hole.\n\n4. No, it is not permissible for a healthy person to pay compensation for the missed fasts. The missed fasts will have to be made up by observing the missed number of fasts.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
