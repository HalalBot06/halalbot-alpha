  "question": "Is Jihad Fardh on every single (Male) Muslim in UK (considering the fact that the majority of the Muslims don't even perform their 5 times daily salaah - an immediate Fardh ???",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Is Jihad Fardh on every single (Male) Muslim in UK (considering the fact that the majority of the Muslims don't even perform their 5 times daily salaah - an immediate Fardh - and no effort has been, nor is being, made to improve their Imaan)? 2. What is the ruling for having an Islamic TV channel to combat other channels (like the Qadianiyyah) claiming to be that of Muslims. My point is that since watching TV is haraam, how can one be justified in using evil to repel evil (baatil), something which can only be destroyed by good (haqq)? People do not seem to realise that Islaah (correction) of the Ummah will only happen through the method adopted by our salaf as-saaliheen (in the khayr al-quroon).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The decree of Jihaad is a major issue involving the Ulama at large. It does not behove one person to issue the decree. Issues of such magnitude must be addressed by a group of competent and leading Ulama and Muftis. However, we do agree on the emphasis of Salaat and also becry the neglect of the Ummah towards Salaat. If we become practical Muslims, non-Muslims will enter into Islam though our example. This is how Islam initially spread ? the strength of Imaan and good character. Muslims need to build on that once again.\n\n2. We also concur with you on this point. Imaam Maalik (RA) stated, ?The latter part of this Ummah cannot be reformed until it does not adopt the ways adopted by the pious predecessors.?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
