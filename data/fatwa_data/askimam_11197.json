Humbly request to explain your response as supposed to a yes or no answer.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari'ah, money is paid in lieu of a tangible item or service. The R1000 is in lieu of a mere right which is not tangible or not in lieu of a service.\n\nThe option and right of selling and purchasing is three days according to a Hadith. Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] did not order any one of the two awaiting parties to be paid in lieu of the right of purchasing and selling.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
