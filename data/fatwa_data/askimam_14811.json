  "answer": "QUESTION\nI want to know what the best duas I can seek from Allah (SWT) after prayer to protect me from the grave's punishment, and most importantly to protect me from the was-was of the shaitan during my period of death so I die a Musliman instead of a kafir? I usually say \"Alahoma Atho beka mena athabi Jahanam wa Athabi' kabir wa otha beka men fitnati donia wal akahria, wa fitnati'l massih al-dajjal.\" Is that good or do you have other doa I can ask Allah (SWT) on top of this? What about the doa for against the fitnah of the shaytan when I die?\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nOne should recite the following Dua After every Salaah.\n\nAllahumma Inni Audhu bika min Adhaabi Jahannam Wa min Adhaabil Qabr Wa min Fitnatil Mahya wa Mamat Wa min Fitnatil Maseeh-id Dajjal\n\nOh Allah! I seek your protection from the torture of Hell, and I seek your protection from the punishment of the grave and I seek refuge from the mischief of life and death, and from the mischief of the dajjal. (Sahih Bukhari 2:102)\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
