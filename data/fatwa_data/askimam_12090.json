  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf so, please explain the meaning. Also, are we required to say, \"Hamdan Kaseeran Tayyiban Mubarkan Feeh\" after \"Rabbana wa lakal Hamd\" when standing up from Ruku? Please provide the translation for the 3 Du?aas mentioned above. Why is this not practiced by everyone?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTama?neenah (to perform slowly and properly) in ruku, qawma, sajda and Jalsa is emphasised in the Hadith. The Ulama have advised that in qawma, the following du?aa should be read in order to attain Tama?neenah, ?hamdan katheeran tayyiban mubaarakan feeh?, and in Jalsa the following du?aa be recited, ?Allaahuma ighfir liy warhjamniy warzuqniy wajburniy wa aafiniy wa af-anna?.\n\nHazrath Moulana Fazlur-rahmaan ? Shaykhul Hadith of Azaadville has prepared an article to draw the attention of people to the importance of Toma?neenah in those postures. You may circulate the article as much as you wish to.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
