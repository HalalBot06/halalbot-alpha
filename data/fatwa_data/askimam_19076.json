  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have several questions about customs at the time of birth and death.\n\n1) Giving adhaan at grave after burial is permissible or not?\n\n2) Reading Surah Fatiha after burial in the grave yard or other places e.g. home is permissible or not?\n\n3) Reading Adhaan in newly born baby's ear is permissible or not? If it is permissible, is it Fajr Adhaan or normal Adhaan?\n\n4) Aqeeqah is permissible or not? If it is, please confirm one goat/lamb for girl baby and two goats/Lambs for boy baby?\n\n5) What is the age limit when every born in this world is naturally muslim and when reading Namaaz becomes compulsory for a child?\"\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n1) It is a bi'dah (innovation) to give adhaan while lowering the deceased into the grave. 1\n\n2) After the burial it is mustahabb (desirable) to stand near the grave for a little while, make supplication of forgiveness for the deceased, or to recite the Quran and send the rewards of this to the deceased. In particular, it is mustahabb (desirable) to recite the beginning verses of Surah Baqarah, Verses 1-5 from the head-side of the grave, and the last two verses of Surah Baqarah, Verses 285-286 from the foot-side of the grave.2\n\nCalling the adhaan in the baby's right ear, and the iqaamah in its left year is from the Sunnah.3 The adhaan to be given is the regular adhaan, without the additional phrases said at the time of Fajr.4\n\nWhen a boy or girl is born, it is advisable to name the child on the seventh day and to observe its aqeeqah. It is one goat or one sheep for a baby girl, and two goats or two sheep for a baby boy.5\n\nWhen a child reaches the age of maturity, Salaah becomes obligatory for him or her.6 However, one should start encouraging the child to pray from the age of seven so he/she gets into the habit.7\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMl.
