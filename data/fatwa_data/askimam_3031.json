  "question": "I am going through a lot of pain and trouble in my home. I have a lot of problems. Please help me?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDue to problems at home my eman is suffering and my taqwa is very low. Out of anger for the way my life is I am committing sins (not major sins though). I was very much into dawa and jihad, and following the sunna; but now I can barley pray my salah. I am unable to concentrate. I am now unable to recite properly, each word I stutter or repeat several times before I can say it. I used to pray my sunna but for some years I have just prayed my obligatory salah only, because I take to long repeating words and making salah very long. I have not given up salah because I still fear Allah. The same goes for reciting the quran, unable to recite properly? Please help, explain to me, what is happening. Is my salah still excepted and am I committing a sin for not reciting correctly in salah and in reading the quran?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn view of the details of your question, we advise you seek the assistance\nof a spiritual guide in whom you may confide and get constant guidance as\nyour matter requires personal and more attention than a simple answer.
