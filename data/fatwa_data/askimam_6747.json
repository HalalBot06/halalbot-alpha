There is no need to put water in the mouth and nose of the deceased, unless the deceased was in need of a bath (Ghusal) at the time of dying.

Then lift the deceased right side and pass the water (mixed with \"Camphor\", (Kapur)) three times nicely so that at the bottom, the left side becomes wet and then take away the cotton buds from the nose and ears. Then, dry the body of the deceased with a cloth (towel). Then apply scent (Itr) etc., on his head and beard (for man only, no Itr is applied to a woman), rub camphor on its forehead, nose, palms and knees but do not put the scented cotton buds into the ears or apply the scent to the \"KAFN\" cloth.
