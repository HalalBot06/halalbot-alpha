  "question": "I have an issue with bleeding…1) Am I allowed to pray two prayers in their respective times with the same wudhu? 2) Can I wear khuffain with this condition and wipe over them when I need to make a new wudhu?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have an issue with bleeding. The place where I make istinja sometimes bleeds, either because of a slight rip in the skin there, or because of some bleeding spots or because of excessive wiping. For example, sometimes during the day I see in my underwear small amounts of blood; however this cannot be found everytime: it is on and off. I usually place a tissue there to protect my underwear, when I take a look at it after some time, sometimes bits of blood are visible and sometimes not. What I want to know is whether I am allowed to pray two prayers in their respective times with the same wudhu, or whether I need to make wudhu in each prayer time. Also, can I wear khuffain with this condition and wipe over them when I need to make a new wudhu.  JazaakAllaahu Khayraa.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nAfter making the wudhu, if bleeding does not take place, your wudhu will remain intact and there is no need to renew the wudhu for the next salaat. Your wudhu will only break when bleeding or anything else that breaks wudhu takes place.\n\nIf, however, you qualify as a ma’zoor (excused person) then special rules will apply. You will qualify as a ma’zoor when the following condition is met: A complete time of salaat elapses in such a way that the bleeding does not stop for long enough for you to be able to perform the salaat in complete purity.\n\nOnce you are classified as a ma’zoor, you will continue to be classified as a ma’zoor as long as you bleed at least once during every salaat time. If an entire time passes in which you do not bleed, you will not remain a ma’zoor.\n\nTherefore, you must determine whether you qualify as a ma’zoor or not. For details on the special rules that apply to a ma’zoor, you may search our website.\n\nIn regards to wearing khuffain and wiping over them when subsequently doing wudhu: yes, once you have wudhu, you may wear khuffain. And when you break your wudhu after that, you may wipe over the khuffain in the place of washing your feet. You can do this for a maximum of 24 hours if a non-traveler and 72 hours if a traveler.\n\n\n\n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMl.
