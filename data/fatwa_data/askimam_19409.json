  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n A certain person did something quite undesirable and stupid about two months ago; he’s very troubled about it and needs your advice urgently.\n\nIn short, he is afraid that his little sister must have touched his dirty underwear by mistake just before using the toilet, and might have become pregnant as a result. He needs to know whether, according to the rules of Islam, he is obliged to tell her about it or not.\n\n\n More details:\n\n  About two months ago, after performing the shameful deed (masturbation) he washed his underwear and hung it on the hook behind the toilet door. Afterwards he went outside the room for a short while and then his sister, who is about 14 years old, went to the same toilet.\n\n What is troubling him is that the underwear, still wet at that time, was hanging right on top of the lock, and thus inevitably his sister must have touched it while locking the door. He is not sure but he thinks that only her right hand would have touched because the lock is in such a position.\n\n He is worried that God forbid she might have become pregnant as a result. But he doesn’t know what the chances for that to happen are. According to him though he did rinse the underwear using soap and water, he might not have washed properly enough and for the required length of time (the underwear still smelled after he had rinsed it), and thus it is still possible for some sperms to have been alive even after the washing. He is also not aware whether his sister knows about pregnancy symptoms and whether she keeps track of her monthly cycles.\n\n Please advise what he should do. Is he obliged to tell her so that she could get a pregnancy test? But then his sin would obviously be exposed and his parents as well as siblings could lose trust in him and ridicule him. And God forbid, if she is pregnant, would an abortion be permissible?\n\n \n\nPS: He requests that this information be preferably kept confidential and the reply be given through email rather than being uploaded on the website. If that is not possible, he says he has no choice but to allow the admin of AskImam to upload the question; whatever the case may be, he is quite desperate for advice.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\n \n\nThe shameful deed you refer to is indeed very shameful and evil. Turn to Allāh Ta’ālā for forgiveness and make a firm intention to rid yourself of this shameful act. If you cannot leave it get married. Nabi (Sallallāhu `alayhi wasallam) metioned:\n\nصحيح البخاري- طوق النجاة - (7 / 3)\n\nباب من لم يستطع الباءة فليصم\n\n5066 - حدثنا عمر بن حفص بن غياث حدثنا أبي حدثنا الأعمش قال حدثني عمارة عن عبد الرحمن بن يزيد قال دخلت مع علقمة والأسود على عبد الله فقال عبد الله كنا مع النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم شبابا لا نجد شيئا فقال لنا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يا معشر الشباب من استطاع الباءة فليتزوج فإنه أغض للبصر وأحصن للفرج ومن لم يستطع فعليه بالصوم فإنه له وجاء\n\n \n\nO group of youth whoever has the ability to marry then he should marry for verily this is a means of lowering ones gazes and protecting ones chastity. Whoever cannot do so then he should take to fasting for verily this is a shield for him.\n\nWhy do you leave you underwear in such places where it is inconvenience for others? You should rather hang your laundry in a more suitable place. It is not permissible to cause a next person inconvenience.\n\nPerform tawbah salāh and turn in sincere repentance to Allāh Ta’ālā. Your sister is not pregnant.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Ishaaq E. Moosa\nBenoni.\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
