  "question": "Dear Imam, I have been on the Deen for several years now & its had more sad times than good. Ive been told its Allahs way of testing me.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAccording to Surah Ankabut Ayah 2? Because most of my friends are born into Islam & they have life so easy. Whatever they want they get with ease & some dont really even pray! this Ramadhan ive seen half-hearted efforts for them to leave their houses to pray Taraweeh. Yet I make an effort & my life is so sad. Does not Allah test all people or being born into the Deen means that you have an easy ticket to jannah? I try my hardest & all people say is its a test & that after hardship comes ease. All I see is hardship & im finding it very hard to cope even though I try with extra deeds to get close to Allah. Doesnt He want me close? Is this His way of saying Im doomed. How do I know when He hates/loves me? Im so confused & geting despondant. All I see around me is people who dont try to even keep their 5 times prayers get so much from Allah. But its like my striving isnt worth anything. I dont pray for anything but Allahs pleasure. But I thought if I obeyed Him it would be easier for Him to respond my Duaa. He says He is angry when we dont supplicate. I supplicate so why is my life so sad?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe purpose of any worship is certainly to earn Allah's pleasure. That will%0D%0Abe manifested by Allah after our death in Jannah (paradise). The comforts of%0D%0Athis world have no value at all in the sight of Allah and neither can it be%0D%0Aan iota of the reward for your sacrifices. Be rest assured that Allah does%0D%0Anot reward in any insignificant way. Allah says in the Quran, If true%0D%0ABelievers would not get despondent, He would grant disbelieves every comfort%0D%0Aof the world but he has limited that in consideration of the feelings of the%0D%0ABelievers. Rasulullah (SAW) said that Allah said, If the world held any%0D%0Avalue in the sight of Allah, He would not give a disbeliever even a drop of%0D%0Awater. However, the reality is, the world is not even equivalent to the%0D%0Awings of a misquito. Possessing the comfort of this world is not a criteria%0D%0Ato determine acceptance or rejection. Should that be the case, Rasulullah%0D%0A(SAW), the greatest prophet of Allah would not have spent his life in a%0D%0Asmall hut, he would not have spent his life without food for months, etc.%0D%0ARasulullah (SAW) said, Those that are close to him also share in hardships%0D%0Aand difficulty. You are indeed fortunate to be one of them. Hence, there is%0D%0Ano reason for you to be in despair and grief. Infact, it is a moment of%0D%0Arejoicing and happiness. Leave your matter to Allah, when He bestows you any%0D%0Agood, be thankful, and when in difficulty, make sabr. That was the Sunnah of%0D%0ARasulullah (SAW).%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
