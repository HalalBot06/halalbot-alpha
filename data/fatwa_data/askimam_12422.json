  "answer": "QUESTION\nAre Talaaq-e-Baain and 3 talaaqs are the same? In case of 3 talaaqs, halaah is necessary. Is Halaah is also necessary in Talaaq-e-Baain for couples to reunite?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person issued his wife on Talaaq-e-Baain, the Nikah is terminated immediately. However, if the couple wish to reconcile, they may do so by having a reperformance of a Nikah. There is no need for Halaalah in this instance.\n\nIf a person issued his wife three divorces, then the marriage is permanently terminated. He cannot reconcile with his wife without making Halaalah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
