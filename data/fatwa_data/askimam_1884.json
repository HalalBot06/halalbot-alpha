  "question": "My boyfriend and I will be getting married soon. He confessed to me that he had an affair with his step mother while living in his fathers house.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam o alaikum! I dont beat them but yesterday I lost temper and pinched one of them and now I found out that it has left scars on his skin. i am really depressed abt this. i avoided beating by hand or sttick because I thought that it could harm them and leave scars so I pinched them and now it has the same result. how could I repent on this as I am really depressed to harm them physically and seeking a way to seek forgiveness from ALLAH. I also have another prb. one opf my uncle is not talking to me on somehting that is really minor at least to me and has no religious hazard. i tried to talk to him over this but he is not cooperating. i try to salam him and also i greeted him on eid. but he is not showing any response. i want to know that how much responsibility is on my shoulders as i think i am trying my best and more could be done to make the things better but i dont find courage in me. pls guide me on this. the last thing is that i am really broke and there is no way that i can continue my education except falling in to a interest based loan. i have no other option(except if ALLAH provides me one insha ALLAH). is there anyway that i can take that loan and then return it before within the minimum amount of time which will safe me a lot interest. i need guidance in all this. Jazak ALLAH khairan khatheeran katheera HAYAK ALLAH\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) It appears that you beat the children to give vent to your anger, not to\neducate them. If so, you have committed a sin. You should regret and repent\nby making an intention never to repeat the crime in future.\n2) You should continue being good to your uncle.\nKindly elaborate on the question of the interest loan.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
