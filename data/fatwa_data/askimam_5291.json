  "answer": "QUESTION\nA brother sent me and others a e-mail criticizing Fazail-e-amaal. He sent us the following link: http://www.uh.edu/campus/msa/group/fazail_2.htm In Fazail Amal you will find that some ahadith have been taken from the book called 'Zailul Aalee' of Imaam Sooyuti, which means \"Tails Of Pearls\", but in the meantime the real name of the book is \"Zailul -La'aali-ul-Masnuah fil Ahadethil Maudhoo'ah\" which means 'Tails of made up pearls in fabricated ahadeeth'. The book taken is Fazail Amal, first edition 1994, english translation. On the end of the pg21 and in the beginning of pg22 in the book of Virtues of Salat, you will find the the words ascribing Kashf of \"seeing sins falling down from the limbs of the person performing Wudhu...\" to Abu Hanifa Kashf means, in Khandhlawi's words \"divine manifestation of unseen things\"(pg.128 of Virtues of Zikr). Muslims know that seeing the unseen(ghaib) is only possible to Allah, and the claim and lie that ppl are able to do such things is CLEAR SHIRK. And on top of that it is a lie on Abu Hanifa there is a hadith on page 142 of Virtues of Zikr, hadith no.28 which in english tells us about Adam and how he asked forgiveness from Allah when he saw Prophet's name on the 'Arsh. Now, if u read the same hadith on the same page in arabic u will find a word MAWDU' which we know means fabricated. The same is not translated into english/Urdu for that matter. That is a clear lie on Prophet\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We definitely agree with the literal translation but the object of the%0D%0Aauthor was not to mention fabricated Ahaadith only. In fact, he mentions%0D%0AAhaadith that some Ulama claim to be fabricated and then challenges that%0D%0Aruling. In some instances, he concedes to the verdict of those Ulama and in%0D%0Aothers he differs and proves the authenticity of these Ahaadith. The proverb%0D%0Ais famous, 'Don't judge a book by it's cover!'%0D%0A2. There is a vast contrast between 'manifestation of unseen things' and to%0D%0Ahave knowledge of the unseen. As mentioned, knowledge of the unseen is only%0D%0Apossessed by Allah Ta'ala. This is a fundamental belief of every Muslim and%0D%0Acannot be contested, however, the manifestation of unseen things is%0D%0Adifferent and has taken place time and again from the time of the Sahaaba%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhum) to our day. The angels of Allah are unseen to man,%0D%0Aalthough we believe in their existence. Similarly, we believe that the%0D%0Apunishment of the grave is true but it is unseen to us. However, the%0D%0Amanifestation of these things were granted to some Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhum), i.e. visibility of the angels for Sayyidatuna Aaisha (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnha), Sayyidunaa ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) and others. The punishment%0D%0Aof the grave was heard and manifested for others. See Hayaatus sahaaba vol.3%0D%0Apgs.777, 841%0D%0AIn the same manner, the washing off of the sins in Wudhu is something we%0D%0Abelieve in because of the Hadith of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Aalthough it is part of the unseen. However, it being part of the unseen does%0D%0Anot negate the possibility of it's manifestation by Allah for anyone of His%0D%0Achosen servants as is the case in the above mentioned examples. The%0D%0Aincidents of Sayyiduna Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) is quite wellknown - when%0D%0Aonce while he was in Madinah and his army was in battle in a land away from%0D%0AMadina, Allah made it possible for him to see his army's position in the%0D%0Abattlefields and he was able to command them from his Minbar in Madinah to%0D%0Achange their position. (See Dalaailun nubuwwa of Abu Nu'aim and Hayaatus%0D%0ASahaaba vol.3 pg.808)%0D%0AIn this instance, Allah manifested for Sayyiduna Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu)%0D%0Awhat remained unseen to the rest of these that were present in that%0D%0Agathering. So, acts of Kashf have taken place many a time and it's%0D%0Arefutation is a clear result of ignorance.%0D%0A3. Firstly, just be the word 'Mawdhoo' being written in the Arabic%0D%0Acommentary does not necessitate that the actual Hadith that was quoted is%0D%0Afabricated. In fact, the author Shaykh Muhammad Zakariyyah cited that ruling%0D%0A(Mawdhoo) in general, in regard to another narration not in regard to Hadith%0D%0Ano.28. Anyone with slight knowledge of the Arabic language will understand%0D%0Athis from that passage. Secondly, based on this misunderstanding for one to%0D%0Ago further and comment on that particular Hadith (no.28) being 'a clear lie%0D%0Aon the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)' is baseless and senseless as%0D%0Awell. In fact, that Hadith is Hasan (sound), neither weak nor fabricated.%0D%0ASee Ra'ul Manaarah pg.248 and al-Raddul muhkamul mateen pg.138. May Allah Ta%0D%0A'ala save us all from such irrational decision regarding the noble sayings%0D%0Aof Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
