  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy son is 1year old and when i pray he distrub me. i want to ask that what is the limit which can break my salat i mean what he do then my salat is break(not valid)?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThe ideal is to perform salah when your child is sleeping or playing etc. in order for you to concentrate on salah. If that is not possible and your child troubles you by crying etc., that does not invalidate your salah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
