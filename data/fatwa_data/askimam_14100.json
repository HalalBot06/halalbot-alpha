  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have a question and want answer if you can I want to ask about the khulfa-e-rashidin, are they selected by God or elected through the uneducated person, if they selected by God then they should be a part of our faith but if they are elected through people, then how it can a part of our faith, if some one not beleive them, they are right opinion that they are elected persons like a bush/tonny blair etc, and if one khalifia nominated to other when he got ill like a empror (as saudi arabia)it is wrong, kindly answer in detail about the status of khulfa-e-rashidin\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah is the sole legislator of this Deen and has communicated his prestine Shari’ah to His creation via divinely revealed scriptures, e.g. Qur’aan, and through his prophets who were sinless and were declared innocent by Allah Himself. These prophets were appointed directly by Allah and were his vicegerents to the earth for maintaining spiritual and temporal order and to announce and promulgate divine commandments, the last of whom was Nabi Muhammad [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam].\n\nAllah had ordained that after Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], his Ummah shall as a body enjoy the privilege which was enjoyed by the Prophets. That is to say, the Ummah as a collective body has been declared to be innocent and under the special protection of Allah Himself, so that it will never unanimously agree upon a doctrinal error or a deviation. Hence, any decision which has been arrived at in religious matters through the consensus of the Ummah is to be regarded as manifestation of divine commandment. That is why the consensus of the Ummah has been accepted as the third source of the Shari’ah after the Qur’aan and the Hadith. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has himself mentioned that my Ummah shall never collectively agree upon error. Since it has been ordained that the Islamic Ummah as a body shall never go wrong, the responsibility of choosing a deputy (Khalifah) to the holy Prophet [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has also been entrusted to it. The first to succeed Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] were the rightly guided Khulafaa.\n\nThere is absolute consensus that Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthmaan and Ali [radhiallaahu anhu] were the rightly guided Khulafaa and were justifiably appointed so. Thus, we conclude that their appointment was sanctioned by Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], who himself was divinely inspired. Furthermore, with regard to the manner of appointment of these Khulafaa, e.g. appointment of Umar [radhiallaahu anhu] by Abu Bakr [radhiallaahu anhu], this too cannot be desputed for Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has himself mentioned, ‘Follow my way steadfastly, and the ways of the rightly guided Khulafaa.’ This shows a sanctioning of their actions by Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] himself which shows that their decisions were not merely temporary judgments, but have a permanent legislative value and cary an authority in their own degree. It will be lunacy to compare this to the appointment of George Bush or an Emperor for obvious reasons. Among them is that their appointment is not religiously based and there is no consensus on their appointment by the Ummah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
