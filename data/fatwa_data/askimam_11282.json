  "question": "Pls explain context and details of hadith #4130,4131 (vol.16) of Sahih Muslim. \"do u think a prophet could cut others hands, pierce their eyes, and let them die on a stone, for stealing some camel?\"",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow should I reply to non-muslims when they ask me why our Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) gave such brutal punishment (Nauzu Billah) ? 2. Many non-muslims are waiting for an answer from me. They asked me \"do u think a prophet shoudl cut others hands, pierce their eyes, and let them die on a stone, for stealing some camel?\" They believe our religion teaches brutality and hostility for followers of other religion. Please explain. Please reply to my whole question. Jazak Allah Khairum Book 016, Number 4130: Anas b. Malik reported that some people belonging (to the tribe) of 'Uraina came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) at Medina, but they found its climate uncogenial. So Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to them: If you so like, you may go to the camels of Sadaqa and drink their milk and urine. They did so and were all right. They then fell upon the shepherds and killed them and turned apostates from Islam and drove off the camels of the Prophet (may peace be upon him). This news reached Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) and he sent (people) on their track and they were (brought) and handed over to him. He (the Holy Prophet) got their hands cut off, and their feet, and put out their eyes, and threw them on the stony ground until they died.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe enquired incident is reported in many authentic books of Ahadith including Bukhari.\n\nThere were eight people who pretended to accept Islam when they fell ill in Madina Munawwara, Rasulullah(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised them to live in the outskirts of Madina Munawwara and drink the milk and urine of camels as a means of cure. After being cured they brutally killed the shepard and drove the camels along with them. The punishment was in lieu of the crime committed by these murderers as well as to set an example to others in particular the Jews who used to stay on the outskirts of Medina Munawwara and were arch enemies of the Muslims.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
