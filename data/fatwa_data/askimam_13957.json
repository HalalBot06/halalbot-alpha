Therefore, it will not be permissible for you to marry any woman. (Alamghiri vol.1 Pg. 432)\n\nHowever, the alternative to this predicament is that since it will not permissible for another person gets you married. That is you may inform another person that you wish to marry, that person in his own capacity may get you married without your express instruction. In this way the Nikah will be valid and it will be permissible for you to stay with that woman. (Imdaadul Fatawaa vol.2 Pg. 156)\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
