  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am currently working for a corporate company. One of the benefits that is compulsary is the Group life Assurance policy.\n\nI do not contribute anything from my side, however the company contributes to the Group life Assurance policy fund monthly.If I pass away, the company will compensate my wife with a huge lump sum.\n\nPlease advise if the above money will be Halaal or Harram (Bearing in mind that I do not contribute to this fund).\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe hope you well.\n\nAccording to Shariah, it will be permissible for your wife to accept the pay out of the fund after your demise. Since the company is contributing on your behalf, the pay out will be considered as a Hiba (gift) to her. Therefore, the gift is permissible and halaal to use.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
