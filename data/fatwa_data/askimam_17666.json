However, if the insurance company chooses to pay you more than the incurred losses, it will be permissible for you to accept it as it was volitionally offered by the company.\n\n \n\n(والراكب) في طريق العامة (ضامن لما وطئت الدابة وما أصابت بيدها) أو رجلها أو صدمته برأسها  (اللباب في شرح الكتاب ج 3 ص 45 , قديمي)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\nMl.
