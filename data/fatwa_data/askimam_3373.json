  "question": "Long Distance Nikaah. A friend of mine wants to get married with a girl but she lives far away.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat are the rulings on a long distance Nikaah? A friend of mine wants to get a nikaah with a girl but she lives far away and his parents are against the whole idea of it. And since he doesn't need parental approval, he wanted to know how he should go about a long distance Nikaah. Jazakallah Khair and Salaam!\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nA Nikah is performed with a proposal (Iejaab) by the male or female and\nacceptance (Qubool) by the male or female in the past and/or present tense\nin the presence of two male Muslim witnesses (Hidaaya vol. 2).\n\nIt is Sunnat that the marriage be announced and performed in the Masjid and\nthe bride be represented by her Mahram (father, brother, etc.). The bride\ngives consent to her representative (Wakeel) in the presence of two\nwitnesses to perform her marriage at the Masjid. At the Masjid, the Wakeel\nrepresents the bride in the presence of the two witnesses who must be\ntrustworthy and pious male Muslims. They should not be from among the girls\nascendants e.g. father, etc. nor from her descendants, e.g. son, etc.\nHaving said that, if the sister (attained puberty) wishes to represent\nherself at the time and place of Nikah, then she may do so without a Wakeel.\nThis is according to the Hanafi Madhab – according to Shaaf’ee permission is\nincumbent.\n\nA marriage without the two witnesses is not valid. the relationship will be\nillegal and Haraam.\n\nIf the above mentioned procedure was carried out, then the Nikah is valid.\n\nMarriage by Proxy (for parties at a distant place)\nThe procedure of marriage by proxy where one of the partners (boy or girl)\npropose to marry the other. The proposal be written in the presence of two\nwitnesses.\n\nThe two witnesses should also sign the document be sent to the other party,\nfor example, in a foreign land and accept the written proposal in the\npresence of two witnesses. It is important to exercise extreme precaution by\nverifying the proposal and its witnessing to avoid any possibility of fraud\nand deception.\n\nand Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
