  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nsalam\n\ni wanted to know is it ok if you do nikah over nikah. i'm engaged and i talk to her over the phone and some times when i'm at her house we talk but i don't feel its right its not possible to get married for about year because of finecial reasons, so we wanted to get nikah done without families knowing because she is going uni to another town soon and we could get nikah done there but later when we get married then we can get nikah done front of families so they don't know if we already have done it please tell me if thats fine to do\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nIf you cannot experience restraint and keep away from the girl, then you should get married to her now. If you can exercise restraint, then do so and marry her later.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
