  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a question that somebody said to my dad that we go to hindu friend for wishs of maha shivratri but dad could not go because he once heard that to wish them on this occoun is gunah sir is this right plz ... sir replay this question this is your most kindness. wasalam Asalam -u Alikum I am from kashmir my name is SUHAIL AHMAD BHAT\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAll praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.\n\nWe commend your pursuit of knowledge and your eagerness to know the teachings of Islam. We earnestly implore Allah to bless your efforts in this honorable way.\n\nIt is confirmed that the Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wassalam) said: “Whoever seeks to please people on the account of displeasing Allah, Allah will be displeased with him and will make people displeased with him.” [Ibn Hibbaan]\n\nThe clear evidence of the Qur’aan and Sunnah – and the consensus of the early generations of this ummah – indicates that there are only two festivals in Islam: Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Any other festivals that have to do with a person, a group, an event or anything else are innovated festivals, which it is not permissible for Muslims to observe, approve of or express joy on those occasions, or to help others to celebrate them in any way, because this is imitating them and it is a kind of taking them as close friends, and Allah Ta’ala has forbidden the believers to imitate them and take them as close friends in the Holy Qur’an. And it is proven that the Prophet (Sallalahu ‘alayhi wassalam) said:\n\n“Whoever imitates a group is one of them.”[Sahih Muslim]\n\nMaha Shiva Hatree Day comes under this heading because it is an idolatrous Hindu festival, so it is not permissible for a Muslim who believes in Allah Ta’ala and the Last Day to observe it or approve of it or congratulate people on it because all of that is cooperating in sin and transgression and is disobedience towards Allah.\n\n“Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment”. [Surah Al-Maa’idah 5:2]\n\nThe Muslim must adhere to the Qur’an and the Sunnah in all his affairs, especially at times of fitnah when evil is widespread. He should be smart and avoid falling into the misguidance of those who have earned Allah’s anger and who have gone astray, and the evildoers who have no fear of Allah and who do not have any pride in being Muslims. The Muslim must turn to Allah and seek His guidance and remain steadfast in following it, for there is no Guide except Allah and no one can make a person steadfast but Him.\n\nIf you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to write back!\n\nMay Allah guide all of us to the straight path, and guide us to that which pleases Him.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMl. Mohammad Ashhad bin Said\n\nCorrespondence Iftaa Student, Mauritius\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
