Zakaat will not be paid for vacant land properties unless the property was bought for resale purposes, then Zakaat will be paid on its market value. In principle, if the debts of the person are equal to his surplus assets or more than that, he is not entitled to pay Zakaat. (Contemporary Fataawa; Mufti Taqi Usmani)\n\n2. Anger is from Shaytaan. So, whenever a person gets angry, he should recite Ta?awwudh and if he is standing, he should sit. If he is sitting, he should lie down and he should also drink a glass of water. (Mishkaat)\n\n3. Controlling of sexual desires can be done by fasting. One should also abstain from lustful glances, reading Haraam magazines and seeing illicit pictures. A person must be occupied with the Dhikr of Allah at all times and increase the Tilaawaat of the Qur?aan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
