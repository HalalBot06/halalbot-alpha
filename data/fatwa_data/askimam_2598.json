  "question": "You have previously stated that only alcoholic sprays derived from grapes/date extracts are impure. In light of this, please inform what the ruling is regarding fragrances containing ‘Alcohol Denat’?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nQ: Is it permissible to use a perfume, deodorant, etc. which contains\nalcohol, and if so, can one perform Salaat without washing it off?\nA: It is not permissible to use deodorants that contain alcohol from grapes\nor date extracts. Such perfumes are impure and Salaat with it is invalid.\nHowever, if the alcohol is synthetic, it is pure and permissible to use.\nSalaat without washing off such perfumes will be valid. Sometimes, it\nbecomes difficult to differentiate between genuine and synthetic alcohol.\nThus, to be on the safe side, one should rather prefer using deodorants and\nperfumes that are labelled as 'alcohol-free', especially when such perfumes\nare easily available.
