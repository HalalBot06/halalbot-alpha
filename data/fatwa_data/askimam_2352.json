  "question": "Difference between shia and sunni? Why does the imam kneel down after the first half of khutbah before jumma prayer. Why do people point there fingers during prayer?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)what is the basic difference between shia and sunni, i am sunni and this has always puzzled me: beliefs, praying.. that kind or stuff i see some pointing for a while, but others keeping wiggling there index finger till the end of namaz\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Shi'as - kindly refer Unbridgeable Divide (at the site) (related QA)\n2. There are two Khutbahs (speeches) on a Friday. The Imaam separates the\ntwo by sitting down after the first. He does not kneel down.\n3. The difference in pointing the finger and shaking it continuously, is due\nto the differences in the different Madhaahib.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
