  "question": "I have heard a lecture that Moulana Mehmood Hasan Madni R.A did manazara about the green dome and won. Can you authenticate?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have heard in lecture of Moulvi Tariq Jameel (Dammatu barakaatum), that during 1924’s some ulemas of Najd had destructed the tombs of Sahabas and finally they planned to destroy the tomb of Our Prophet (peace be upon him), when this matter spreads around the Munazara was fixed between Ulema of Nazd and other Ulemas around the world, from the side of Ulemas around the world\n\nSheikul Arab wa ajam Allama Mehmood Hassan madni (First Student of the Great Madarsa  Darool Uloom Deoband) was selected as the Munazir (speaker).\n\nThe debate starts and finally Allama Mehmood Hassan madni (Rahmatullahi Alaihi) had won the debate,\n\nI want to know in detail, what is the hadith that Moulana had made as base and some brief about the discussion.\n\nI heard that , the whole debate is available in a format of book, if possible can you please give the information about the book.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n \n\nWe have not come across the audio of Maulana Tariq Jameel Saheb wherein the incident of the green dome is narrated as you have described. The audio of Maulana Tariq Jameel Saheb which we have come across give the account with some difference. \n\nNonetheless, we will present the incident as it has been reported in some of the books. The incident took place in 1927 (1344-5H) and is not regarding Sheikhul Hind Hazrat Maulana Mahmood Hasan Deobandi rehmatullah alayh (d. 1920CE / 1339H), rather one of his students’ Allama Shabeer Ahmed Uthmani rematullah alayh (d. 1949CE / 1369H).\n\nAllama Shabeer Ahmed Uthmani rematullah alayh is one of the luminaries of last century who excelled and championed in Islamic Academics. He wrote exemplary works like Tafseer Uthmāni and Fathul Mulhim Sharah Sahih Muslim, whose brilliance is open for intellectuals of this field.\n\nIn 1927 after Ibn Sa’ūd had taken over Madinah, he started to cleanse the area from all forms of practices which he deemed contrary to Shariah. Ibn Sa’ūd was a Hambalī in fiqh and followed a very stringent interpretation of the classical texts with the consultation of Ulama of Najd. He deemed that all buildings built over graves were directly responsible for the Shirk and Kufr of people who come and prostrate at these places. Hence he took measures to remove all these structures on the graves. In doing so, he made no distinction between the graves that belonged to Sahaba or Azwaj of Nabi salallāhu ‘alayhi wasallam. According to his orders all structures were to be demolished. \n\nIf the treatment continued, the same logic also demanded that the green dome over the resting place of Nabi salallāhu ‘alayhi wasallam be removed as well. Such concerns caused a sudden uproar all over the Ummah and Ibn Sa’ūd sensed the increasing tension among the muslims against his regime in Hijāz.\n\nIbn Sa’ūd, in his effort to deal with the intense situations called for a conference of leading Ulama from different parts of the Muslim world to discuss the matter. India being one of the bigger countries was asked to send a delegation of Ulama. Jamiatul Ulama Hind sent Allama Shabeer Ahmed Uthmani, Mufti Kifayatullah Saheb Dehelvi and Maulana Abdul Haleem Sadiqī Saheb rehmatullah alayhim, while Khilafat Committee sent Maulana Muhammad Ali Jawhar, Maulana Shawkat Ali and Maulana Sayed Suleman Nadwi rehmatullah alayhim.[1]\n\nThe delegation reached Makkah Mukarrama in May 1927. Allama Shabeer Ahmed Uthmani rahmatullah alayh gave numerous talks presence of Ulama of Najd. Ibn Sa’ūd was impressed by the in depth knowledge and faqahat of Ulama from Hind, and acknowledged at occasions of his happiness on having met them.\n\nIn the limited historical books we have access to, we can conclusively state that this delegation did tackle the issue of taking blessing from special places. They also implored Ibn Sa’ūd not to show obsession in obliterating these sites as that would cause undue unrest and opposition against his regime. Allama Shabeer Ahmed Uthmani rahmatullah alayh established that the while building on the graves is not permissible, but a radical approach towards destruction of these sites was counterproductive and against wisdom. While all these angles to the arguments were discussed, the books do not make any mention of the Green Dome.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Faisal bin Abdul Hameed\nStudent, Darul Iftaa\nCanada\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net\n\nReferences :\n\nHayāt Uthmānī\nKamalāt Uthmānī\nMalfuzāt Muhaddith Kashmīrī\n\n\n\n\n[1] Hazrat Maulana Ahmad Ridhā Saheb Bijnaurī rehmatullah alayh gives a slightly different account of the delegation. He quotes a malfūz from Allama Shabeer Ahmed rehmatullah alayh and says that from the side of Jamiatul Ulama Mufti Kifayatullah rahmatullah alayh and myself were appointed as delegation members while Maulana Ahmad Sa’īd and Maulvi Abdul Haleem rahmatullahuma alayh came along as secretaries. Syed Sulam Nadwi rahmatullah alayh was representing Khilafat Committee. (Malfuzāt Muhaddith Kashmirī Pg 184)"
