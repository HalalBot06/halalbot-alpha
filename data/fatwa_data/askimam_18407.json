  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nOn Eid-ul-Adha if a person want to share in an animal, is it neccessary that he should pay for the share before qurbani?? if he dedicate a person and say to him that put my share on you animal i will give you mony letter then he provide mony after some days of eid, his sacrifice is accepted or not??    \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\n \n\nIt is not a pre-requisite for the validity of the Qurbāni that the animal or the share of the animal should be paid for before it can be slaughtered.\n\nوأما ركنها فذبح ما يجوز ذبحه في الأضحية بنية الأضحية في أيامها لأن ركن الشيء ما يقوم به ذلك الشيء والأضحية إنما تقوم بهذا الفعل فكان ركنا كذا في النهاية\n  (الفتاوى الهندية  ج 5 , ص 291)\n\nIt is sufficient that the person has merely purchased the animal or its share before Qurbāni. Payment of the animal or its share can be made after Qurbāni.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n________________________________________________________________________"
