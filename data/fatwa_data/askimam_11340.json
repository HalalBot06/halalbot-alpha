  "question": "Attendance at a non-Islamic Wedding...cousin's wedding is drawing closer. I'm invited. I know from past weddings - it will have a mixture of hindu and christian/jewish customs",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy cousin's wedding is drawing closer and I am sure to be invited. However, I also know - from past weddings - that it will have a mixture of hindu (mushrik) and christian/jewish (ahl-al-kitaab) customs (as do most \"Muslim\" weddings nowadays), as well as the \"necessary music\" (and other forbidden practices). With full knowledge of this, and after warning them of the consequences of not submitting to Islam, will I be absolved of not attending the functions (not to mention that only the waleemah is sunnah)? Or do you suggest a more appropriate course of action?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for a Muslim to attend a wedding in which the laws of the Shari?ah are violated. Shari?ah also emphasises on maintaining family ties. However, that is without compromising the laws of the Shari?ah.\n\nIf you are invited to your cousins wedding and are sure that there will be unIslamic activities taking place there, you should advise your cousin of the wrong with wisdom. You may also forward this Fatwa to them. If there is nothing unIslamic in the Waleemah, then you should attend.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
