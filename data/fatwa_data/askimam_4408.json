  "question": "As-Salaam-u-Alaikum. I would like to know the rulings on what to do in each of the following cases. (Refer details)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy questions are: 1) two people want to make Jamaat for Fard Salaat. Should they stand next to each other or should the Imam stand slightly in front of the second person. 2) What do you do if, while 2 people are making Jamaat for Fard Salaat, the wudhu of the Imam or second person breaks. Should the Imam then perform Salaat as if not in Jamaat? Jazakallahu-khair, As-salaam-u-alaikum\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nUnanswered1. The Muqtadi (follower) should stand on the right of the Imaam slightly%0D%0Abehind him. Just to elucidate further, the Muqtadi's toes will be more or%0D%0Aless in line of the Imaam's heels.%0D%0A2. If the Wudhu of the Imaam breaks, the Imaam can draw one of the Muqtadies%0D%0Aforward to continue with the Salaat from the point where his Wudhu broke.%0D%0AThe Imaam would then go to make Wudhu and return to join the Jamaat behind%0D%0Ahis appointed Imaam. He would first complete whatever he missed out and then%0D%0Acontinue with the second Imaam.%0D%0AIn the case where there is only one Muqtadi, the automatically becomes the%0D%0AImaam if he has the ability to make Imaamat. On the other hand, if the%0D%0AMuqtadi's Wudhu break, the Imaam will continue as normal. The Muqtadi can go%0D%0Aout to make Wudhu, return to the Jamaat and first perform whatever he missed%0D%0Aand then continue with the Imaam.%0D%0AThese Masaail are referred to as 'Masaail of Ikhtilaaf' . Since they are a%0D%0Abit complex for an ordinary layman, in the case where the Imaam's Wudhu%0D%0Abroke, it is most advisable for all - Imaam and Muqtadi - to start the%0D%0ASalaat anew. Where the Muqtadis Wudhu broke, the Imaam would continue as%0D%0Anormal.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Kadwa%0D%0Afor: FATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
