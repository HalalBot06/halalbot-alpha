  "answer": "QUESTION\nAOA. My question is that living in the western society, I have become a bad Muslim. I have fallen into many traps such as not praying, reading Quran, masturbating and other such evils. How do I stop all this and become a good Muslim again.\n\nAlso, my mother is very religious and a good Muslim. Is it possible that my sins are affecting her in any way? Do my actions contribute towards her overall gunnah and sawaab? I have heard the Hadith which tells that good deeds are passed on for generations but is there something similar for gunaah?\n\nDo Muslims who commit gunaah suffer consequences in this life, or are all consequences saved till the hell fire?\n\nPlease put my mind at easy, as I would hate to know that my gunaah affects anyone else.\n\nJazaakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nWe are human beings and we have our weaknesses. We are bound to err. However Allah created us with intelligence. Once we know and realize our wrongs, we repent and make an effort to change ourselves.\n\nThank Allah that he gave you the realization of your wrongs.\n\nYou should regret all the wrongs and repent to Allah.\n\nMake a firm intention never to commit those wrongs again.\n\nEvery individual will be responsible for his/her deeds in the hereafter. No individual will bear the sin of another in the hereafter. However, it is possible that the innocent people could suffer the consequences of other people’s sins in this world.  \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
