  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe live in USA. And have a local masjid where due to lack of the funds and we cannot have a permanent Imaam at the masjid and also we do not have jumah prayer held at that location. But four paryers a held almost daily there except Zuhr. There are couple of muslim brothers who are good in quran and and have beard too (Alhumdulillah). But at the time of jamat , no one is ready to lead the prayer and used to say each other to lead prayer. (1.)Is this practice Ok? Some time the person leading the salaat knows less quran than the person standing behind him ( but is not ready to lead the salaat).even the persoan leading the salaat is not ready to lead but he has to on the insist of the muq-tadeen.(2) Please clarify this issue and also write the conditions of choosing the imaam? (3.)And in our condition how can we know that who knows more quran than others? (4) Is age a factor if other conditions looks to be fulfilled by two or three persons. Please answer? JazakAllah ho khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is permissible for those less earned to make Imaamat of those\nmore-learned than them. However, it is best for the most learned to lead the\nSalaat.\n2. Perhaps the more learned person is excused (Ma'zoor) or he is unwilling\nto perform for some reason or the other.\n3. From amongst those willing to lead the Salaat, choose the person whom you\nfeel is more learned provided he is not an open sinner.\n4. Yes, age can be factor in selecting an Imaam if the other conditions are\nmet by a few people.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
