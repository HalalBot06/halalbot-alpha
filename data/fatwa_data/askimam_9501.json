  "question": "Is it true that Nabi Sallalahu Aalaihiwasallam used to wear topi the whole day except during sleep ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are many Ahaadith in support of the Topi (hat). Just as other Sunnats%0D%0Aare to be followed at all times, similarly the topi should be worn at all%0D%0Atimes.%0D%0A%0D%0ASpecial care should, however, be given to covering the head when performing%0D%0ASalaat and when answering the call of nature. Hereunder are a few Ahaadith%0D%0Aregarding the Topi of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam):%0D%0A1. Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha) mentions that when on journey, Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) would wear a Topi with ear-flaps. While at%0D%0Ahome, he would wear a Syrian Topi. (Akhlaaqun-Nani pg.104)%0D%0A2. Ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) says, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Awould wear a white Topi. (Tabrani; Majma-uz-zawaaid vol.5 pg.21)%0D%0A3. Habib ibn Salih (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that when Nabi (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) would enter the toilet, he wore shoes and covered his head.%0D%0A(Bayhaqi vol.1 pg.96)%0D%0A4. Waail ibn Hujr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) mentions that he performed Salaat with%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) who%0D%0Awere wearing barnases (a type of topi or garment with a hood).
