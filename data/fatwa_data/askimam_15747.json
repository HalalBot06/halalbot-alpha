Alhamdulillah, The Shayateen were chained in the month of Ramadaan. Our Nafs were weekened due to fasting. We have understood ourselves and our potential to be close to Allmighty Allah. We went against our natural Demands of not eating and drinking and not fulfiling our base desires. This clearly indicates our potential to fullfil all the ordains of Allah.\n\n2. The shayateen will be released after Ramadan. We will also be eating and fulfiling our desires. The combination of the shaytaan and nafs presents to us a very huge challenge to our Imaan. Hereunder is a prescription to overcome that and lead our life as we led in Ramadan:\n\n Rasulullah صلى الله عليه وسلم said, Three things serve as a guard against the shaytaan.\n\n a. Perfect ones wudhu ( Not just a customary wash , regard it to be an act of spirituality as sins are forgiven through wudhu. )\n b. Come to the masjid ( being the house of Allah, one will be saved from the fitna of the outside world )\n c. Wait for the next Salaat after performing salaat. ( This is an expression of ones attachment to Masjid, Coming to Masjid should not be a burden )\n\nImagine if a person has to lead his daily life according to the above prescription. Shaytaan will not mislead him as he will be always attached to Ibadat of Allah. \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa\n\n\n\nPlease note that the site will be closed For EID till Tuesday 16th October 2007.\n\nAny questions submitted within this period will be automatically deleted, and will need to be resubmitted."
