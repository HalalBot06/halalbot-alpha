  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nOne of my friend told me that :\n\n1. Migrate to Kuffar country is haram\n\n2. Working in a kuffar country (which is not his home country) also haram since we are helping them to promote thier economy.\n\nIs it true? If not, please provide me the source i just want to let him know about it.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThe ruling of Migration to a non-Muslim country, permanent settlement there and working etc. will defer from person to person according to the reason of migration.\n\n \n\nA.    If a Muslim is forced to migrate from his country because of him being prosecuted, imprisoned or his property being confiscated etc. then for him to migrate to a non Muslim country for would be permitted.\n\n \n\nB.     If one is forced to migrate due to financial reasons, him having no means of sustenance (in his present country) despite extensive effort to acquire his livelihood then it would be permissible for him to migrate to a non Muslim country.\n\n \n\nC.     If a Muslim migrates to a non Muslim country for Dawat purposes, then such a migration is rewarding.\n\n \n\nD.    If a person has sufficient means of livelihood in his native country and is able to live according to the average standards of its people and then migrates to live a life of luxury and comfort in a non Muslim country, then such a migration would not be free of Karahat (abnormity).  (Contemporary Fatawa, Pg.295-297. Idara-e-Islamiat)\n\n \n\nHafiz Ibn Kather has quoted a narration which appears in Musnad Al-Ahmad that Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said;\n\n“All cities belong to Allah Ta’ala, and all people are His servants. Therefore wherever you find goodness live there”.\n\n(Ibn Kateer, Vol, 3. Pg.392. Dar AL-Mufed)\n\n(Marif Al-Quran, Vol. 6. Pg.710. Maktaba Dar Al-Uloom Karachi)\n\n \n\nHafiz Ibn Katheer further states; it is for this reason (as mentioned in the above hadith that with the commanded of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) a group of Sahaba migrated to Abyssinia when it became difficult for them to reside in Makah (due to the hardships they were facing at the hands of the disbelievers).  (Ibn Kather, Vol, 3. Pg.392. Dar AL-Mufed)\n\n \n\nThe Sahaba (Radiallahu Anhum) migrated and lived in many non-Muslim countries for purposes of dawat, due to which the world saw and accepted Islam. Therefore it will be permissible to migrate & work in a non-Muslim country subject to the above conditions.\n\nFinally, if a person adopts a non-Muslim nationality solely for the purposes of increasing his standing in society, pride and imitation of the kuffar, then all such actions will be haram.\n\n(Contemporary Fatawa, Pg.298. Idara-e-Islamiat)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Safraz Mohammed,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
