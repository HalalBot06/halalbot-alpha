  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy situation is similar to that which was mentioned in question #2654. I failed to perform several fasts when I was younger, without a valid excuse. Alhamdulillah, I have already performed the Qadhaa fasts. However, is it obligatory upon me to perform Kaffara fasts as well? If so, must they be performed consecutively or can they be separate. If many Kaffara fasts must be performed consecutively for each missed fast, I think it would be difficult upon me since I would have to fast for several years continuously--may I instead feed the poor or give money in charity? Jazak Allah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf you did not begin the fast in the first instance, then Qadhaa and Tawbah is sufficient.\n\nKaffaarah only applies where a person begun the fast and then broke it intentionally without a valid excuse.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
