  "question": "Dressing for Ihram while there is chance for dropping of urine drops",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Mufti Saheb, After the passing of urine small drops of urine comes out within 10 minutes. But this doesn't happen always. Also I cannot feel this. I can see this only if I look on the penis. So I use to keep a tissue inside my undergarment and I removes it before Salath. I am planning to go for Umrah. While in Ihram we can't use undergarments. So what measure I must take as a precaution. Since I cannot feel the urine passing which is very very little. Can I tie a tissue on my organ so that to be sure of that. Will it make my Ihram invalid? \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The tying of a tissue is permissible, and will not be against the rules\nof Ihraam. However, our advice is that this is not necessary. As long as you\nare not certain that urine has come out, then your Wudhu is valid. Simply\nignore any whisperings of Shaytaan or any doubts. \n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
