What can I do to help them? are they commintting big sin? Will allah forgive them for that? any duaa she should read? can they be together? In Islam, are we allowed to get married to our uncle?? please reply soon! Thanks.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe relationship between an uncle and his niece is that of a mahram,%0D%0A(prohibited in marriage). It is similar to the relation between a father and%0D%0Adaughter, mother and son, or brother and sister. Such a prohibition is%0D%0Acommon in every religion and was and is well respected. The male mahram is%0D%0Aexpected to protect the chastity and honour of his female mahram. A%0D%0Arelationship between Mahrams is abhorred to the extreme. Even animals abhor%0D%0Asuch a relationship. You should apply wisdom and diplomacy in communicating%0D%0Athe above to your friend. In order to turn her mind away from her uncle,%0D%0Ayou may convince her to marry and search for a compatible partner. She%0D%0Ashould also severe every form of relationship with her uncle. If possible,%0D%0Ayou may seek her permission and discuss the matter with her uncle. He also%0D%0Aneeds to be counselled. Discuss with him the Fear for Allah, the importance%0D%0Aof the family unity, the consequences should his brother (the girl's father)%0D%0Aknow about the abuse etc, his personal responsibilities and honesty to his%0D%0Awife and children. These are some points that may be discussed with your%0D%0Afriends as well. Since your friend confided in you, you should help her to%0D%0Athe best of your ability. After all, prohibiting and stopping and evil is a%0D%0Aduty of every Muslim.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
