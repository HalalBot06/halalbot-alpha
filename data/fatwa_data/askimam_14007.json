  "answer": "QUESTION\nOnce I asked my wife to pick up my child who was in my arms. My mother-in-law quickly instead came forward and put her palms below my palms holding the child. I did not feel any passion/shahwat. However, my question is, do we need to find out if she felt such in order to feel safe about my wife's nikah with me. I did pull my hands back as soon as I could feel my child safely in my mother-in-law's hands.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The Nikah is intact.\n\n2. There is no need for you to find out the feeling of your mother-in-law.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
