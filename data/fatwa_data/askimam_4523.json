  "question": "When to start praying Darood Shareef for marriage?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu Alaikum 1) I would like to know if the 500 times Darood for marriage is to be recited when a female reaches a marriageable age (when she is ready to get married) or can a female start reciting it at an early age? I am 21 and have Alhumdulillah started to recite Darood, and my sister is 17. Should she as well begin to recite for marriage at this age? Please advice us in this situation. 2) My male cousin always stares at me when there is a gathering of relatives. I always ignore him but I still feel uncomfortable. If we meet at someone else's house then I cannot get up and leave to some other room. What should I do? Jazakallah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) Your sister is 17, which is a marraigable age. She may recite the Durood.\n2) The observance of Hijaab is a compulsory duty just as Salaah and fasting.\nIt is your Islamic duty to remain concealed from such male relatives. Are\nyou more concerned with his displeasure or the displeasure of Allah Ta'ala?\nThere is no reason why you cannot get up and go. At the same time it would\nbe good to inform him via some elderly lady of the family that your\nremaining aloof from him is for no other reason but the fear of Allah\nTa'ala. This will avoid misunderstandings and ill feelings.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
