  "question": "I send some amount every month to them. Can this me considered as Zakat",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI live in canada and I send every month some amount to a widow in pakistan, this widow has 1 daughter and a widow daugter in law and no one to earn for them. So I send some amount every month to them. Can this me considered as Zakat. My wife says that this cannot be considered Zakat, as Zakat has to be given at a certain time of the year (Ramadan)? Please clear this confusion.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf you give the money to the widow and her widow daughter-in-law with the intention of Zakaat, it is permissible. The Zakaat will be discharged.\n\nZakaat can be discharged any time in the year. It does not have to be discharged in Ramadhaan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
