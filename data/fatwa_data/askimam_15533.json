  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIm doing partnership business with two of my colleagues who are non-muslims( hindus) we are selling printers and peripherals one of them is a lady we have been doing business for past 4 years without any problem and i dont foresee any problem in the future insha allah, but of late im thinking is it ok to be associated with them if yes is there any thing i should practice and in the mean time ive been giving dawa to islam and i speak about islam they show lot of interest in it . can i continue doing business with them or quit because after so many years of hardwork we are reaping the benefits please advice\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh  \n\nIn principle, it is not preferable, though permissible, to have dealings with non-Muslims unless there’s a dire need to do so. Moreover, if the dealing is such that it becomes a means of disgrace for Muslims, then it will not be permissible to do such dealings.  \n\nلا بأس بأن يكون بين المسلم والذمي معاملة إذا كان مما لا بد منه كذا في السراجية\n\nFatawa Hindiyyah Vol.5 Pg.348 (Maktabah Rashediyyah)\nJawahirul Fiqh Vol.2 Pg.183 (Maktabah Darul Uloom Karachi)\nFatawa Mahmoodiyyah Vol.8 Pg.300 (Kutub Khana Mazhari)\n\nHowever, in a situation where it is a means of propagating Islam, it will be permissible to have a partnership with non-Muslims, on condition that precaution is taken in avoiding haraam earnings. The dealings done by the non-Muslims for the partnership should also comply with the rules of Shariah. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMl. M.
