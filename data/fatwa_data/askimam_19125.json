  "question": "Is wearing red clothes permissible for men? Didn’t the Prophet (s.a.w.) wear red clothes?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) Is wearing red coloured clothes permissible for men?\n\n2) Isn’t it mentioned in the hadith that Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) wore red clothes?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\n1) It is makrooh tahreemi (i.e. impermissible and sinful) for men to wear garments that have been dyed with safflower (red colour) or saffron (yellow/orange colour). It is permissible for men to wear clothes that have been dyed with anything other than saffron and safflower regardless of the colour of the garment.\n\nIf, however, the garment is plain red and has been dyed with anything other than safflower, then there is a difference of opinion among the Jurists regarding its permissibility for men. The preferred view is that it is makrooh tanzeehi (i.e. disliked and better to avoid, though not impermissible).\n\nWearing a red cap or a red turban on the head, however, is permissible without any karaaha (reprehensibility or dislike) according to all the Jurists.\n\nThe detail above is regarding plain red garments. If the garment is not plain red and has patterns of other colours as well, then wearing it is permissible without any karaaha.\n\n\n(Imdaadul Ahkaam: 4/359,361 Maktaba Darul Ulum Karachi)\n\n(Ahsanul Fataawa: 8/62, Saeed)\n\n \n\n2) Yes, it does come in the hadith that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) wore a red garment (See: Sahih Bukhari, hadith 5848). However, scholars have mentioned that the red garment that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) wore was not plain red; instead, it had other colours as well. This is because the type of red garment that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) had worn (hulla) typically had red lines (khutut) along with lines of other colours.\n\n \n\nقال العلامة العيني: واعلم أن في لبس الثوب الأحمر سبعة أقوال ... السابع تخصيص المنع بالثوب الذي يصبغ كله ، وأما ما فيه لون آخر غير الأحمر من بياض وسواد وغيرهما فلا ، وعلى ذلك تحمل الأحاديث الواردة في الحلة الحمراء ، فإن الحلل اليمانية غالبا تكون ذات خطوط حمر وغيرها ( عمدة القاري: 22/36 ، العلمية)\n\n \n\n( وكذا في فتح الباري: 13/377 ، العلمية )\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMl.
