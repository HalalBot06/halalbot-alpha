  "question": "And also is it permissable to force women to wear the hijab and to force Muslims to follow the Sharia Law?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease have a read of this (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7098480.stm) story and tell me if this is right according to the Sharia Law.\n\nAnd also is it permissable to force women to wear the hijab and to force Muslims to follow the Sharia Law?\n\nAs I see it it is completely up to the individual whether he/she follows the Islamic way of life because at the end of the day each individual will be questioned on the Day of Judgement. And also if one is forced to do something then obviously their heart won't agree so they will not get the sawaab for it any how.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nWe do not have the benefit of time to read the story in reference.\n\nAccording to shariah, it is compulsory upon a Muslim Government to establish and maintain a moral society. They will have to do whatever it takes to avoid immorality. The evils and immoralities in a western society is well known by all. Rape, abortion, adultery, fornication homosexuality, lesbianism, discos, night clubs, illegitimate children, marital breakups are some of the dilemmas faced by the west. The root cause of all these evils is the free mixing of the opposite genders.\n\nThe institution of hijab is a great blessing to this ummah as it stems out all the evils that emanate without hijab. If an Islamic Government does not institute hijab, it will inadvertently face the host of problems faced by the west.\n\nIf a Muslim citizen abides by the law of the country against his/her wish, he/she will still be rewarded for co-operating with the Government.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
