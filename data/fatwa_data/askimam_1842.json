  "question": "Can my wife study higher studies",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am from India and working now in US. I have been engaged with a girl and Insha Allah, our marriage is scheduled to be held on May 2001. I kindly request you to inform me about the Mahar (Dower). How much Mahar (Dower) should I pay the bride? Who should fix the Mahar amount? Should I need to give the Mahar to my fiancée or her father? Should I also need to give Mahar to the father of my fiancée apart from the Mahar to my fiancée? Waiting eagerly for your kind reply. Jassakkallahu Khairun Khateeran. Warm Regards, Wassalam. Yours loving brother.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMahr (dowry) is the right of the wife and not the right of her father.\nHowever, you may offer a gift to the father if you wish to. The mahr amount\nshould be by mutual agreement between you and your future wife. You may\nreach an agreement on the amount through a representative of your future\nwife. The minimum amount of mahr is ten dirhams, which is approximately $10.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
