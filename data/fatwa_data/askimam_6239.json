  "question": "My mother took a loan from me and now forgot about it,should i ask about my debt?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy mother couple of times took loan from me & forgot about it,i never ask about that,but she gave us money on some occasion and tell everyone that i gave my daughter this amount of money.Problem is that she might not remember it but this breaks my heart.And also she is kind of arrogant and i do not know how to deal with her.What should i do about it?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt would be a great favour to your mother if you considered your loan to her\nas an assistance to your mother than regarding it as a debt or a loan.\n\nHowever, it will be permissible to remind her in the most dignified manner,\nabout the debt or loan. Treat your mother with utmost kind and love and talk\nto her in the most kind way. The Qur'aan states with regards to dealing with\nparents, 'and do not even utter to them (parents) 'uff', and do not scold\nthem, instead tell them compassionate words.'\n\nThe word 'uff' refers to such words that would hurt their feelings or which\nwould result in showing disrespect to them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
