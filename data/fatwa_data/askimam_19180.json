  "question": "If someone get fraud degrees . Are his earnings are Haram?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf someone get fraud degrees . Are his earnings are Haram?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nThe hallmark of a Muslim is to be truthful and honest. It does not behove a Muslim to speak lies and cheat. Those are the traits of a hypocrite. It is truthfulness and honesty that leads a person to recognise Allah and get close to Allah.\n\nA liar and cheater is deprived of the closeness to Allah and the true recognition of Allah Ta’āla. Truthfulness and honesty is not confined to the issues of faith. It is in all spheres of life; truthfulness in one dealings, truthfulness in one’s family and associates. Truthfulness in education and examination reflects the real value of a Muslim. To cheat in exams and fraudulently obtain a degree is an abhorrent act.\n\nIf a person cheats and lies in one issue, that will lead him to lies in another issue. It is a common saying, “a liar will have to speak ten lies to defend one lie”.\n\nNevertheless, the issue of the earning being halal with a fraud degree depends on the service provided.\n\nIf such a person correctly and appropriately provided the service, his income in lieu of the service will be halāl. The sin of speaking lies and fraudulently obtaining a degree is a different issue.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai"
