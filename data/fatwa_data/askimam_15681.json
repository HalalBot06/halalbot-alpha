  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am 32 years old muslim lady who is not married yet.My parents and myself have been looking around but no luck. my question is if a person does not get married is it because allah is angry with that individual or is it just faith. Also allah says you will meet your partner in heaven. so people who do not get married what will happen in there case.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nYou asked whether being unmarried is a result of Allah’s anger or not?  It is the belief of the Muslims that this world is not the world in which we get the results of our action.  For that Allah has destined the Day of Judgment.  A person having a prosperous life, not having any worries, having good health does not necessarily mean Allah is pleased with him/her.  On the same note if a person is a pauper, physical ill, having a lot of worries does not mean Allah is displeased with him/her.  The level of pleasure and displeasure of Allah is in proportion to the amount of taqwa he has.  Yes, sometime Allah does give a little bit of the result in this world as well, but this is not always the case.  Allah also gives difficulties to those that are close to him and beloved. It is narrated in a hadith:\n\nعن مصعب بن سعد بن أبي وقاص ، عن أبيه قال سألت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم من أشد الناس بلاء قال النبيون ثم الأمثل فالأمثل يبتلى الرجل على حسب دينه إن كان صلب الدين اشتد بلاؤه وإن كان في دينه رقة ابتلي على حسب دينه فما يبرح البلاء على العبد حتى يدعه يمشي على الأرض ليس عليه خطيئ (المستدرك للحاكم)\n\nSa’d ibn Abi Waqas narrated that I asked Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) that who are the people that the put have the most trails and tribulations? He replied, “The Prophets, then the most pious then those after them.  A person is tested according to level of his deen.  If his deen is firm, the stronger the trails and tests will be.  If there is weakness in his deen, he will be tested accordingly. The trials do not end until it leaves in him in such a manner that he walks on the ground without any sins.\n\nSo it is incorrect to think that you are still single due to the fact that Allah is displeased with you.  Everything happens by the will of Allah.  Try to have a positive attitude in this situation.  It is preferable to get married at a young age, but that does not mean it is not possible to get married at any other time.  Especially in today’s time, people get married at a later age due to many reasons, such as education, family traditions, etc.  Do not give up hope and keep looking for the right partner.  Many times due to family traditions and values it is hard to find a right partner.  Preference should be given to a religious person, even though he might not be financially well or extremely handsome.  May Allah make it easy for you and grant you a pious caring partner in life, Ameen.\n\nRegarding the question of what will happen to those women who never married in this world, Allah Ta’ala will marry them with other men in Jannah to who so ever He wishes.  (Rooh al-Ma’ani)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
