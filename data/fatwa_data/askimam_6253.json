  "question": "1) “Ya Rasullulah, please ask Allah to help me”, is this permissible? 2) Was the Fiqh ul Akbar and Fiqh ul Absat written by Imam Abu Hanifah 3)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) In your previous answers you have said that tawassul is allowed but calling upon other than Allah Ta'ala is haram. What about the type of tawassul where you call upon a Prophet or Wali directly, but instead of asking for help, you merely ask for them to ask Allah for help on your behalf. Is this valid? For example if I went to the grave of the Prophet (Sallalahu Aleyhi Weselem), and said, ?Ya Rasullulah, please ask Allah to help me?, is this permissible? 2) Was the Fiqh ul Akbar and Fiqh ul Absat written by Imam Abu Hanifah or by one of his students? 3) If one were to unintentionally miss Isha namaz and go straight into tarawih, does this mean his tarawih prayer is invalid, even if he does qadha namaz for his missed Isha? 4) If I were to rinse my mouth and nostrils just once, would my ghusl be valid, or do I have to do it thrice? 5) The founder of the Ikhwan ul Muslimeen of Eypt, Hasan al-Banna, what exactly was his movement about? Is it true that he was a Salafi, or did he follow a maddhab?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Kindly refer below our standard reply to similar queries.%0D%0A2. Fiqhul Akbar and Fiqhul Awsat were written by Imaam Abu Hanifa%0D%0A3. The Taraweeh Salaat is subordinate to the Esha Salaat. Hence, for the%0D%0Avalidity of the Taraweeh Salaat, it is necessary for the Esha to be%0D%0Aperformed.%0D%0A4. Ghusl would be valid.%0D%0A5. We have no knowledge of his movement and beliefs, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AIsaal-e-Sawaab (to perform a virtuous act and grant the reward to any%0D%0Aperson, alive or deceased) is permissible. On numerous occasions, Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised the Sahaaba (Radhiyallaahu Anhum) to%0D%0Agive charity on behalf of the deceased.%0D%0A%0D%0AOne specific incident is of Hadhrat Abu Talha (Radhiallaahy Anhu) when the%0D%0AAayat, 'You cannot attain virtue until your spend what is beloved to you.'%0D%0A(Nisaa 4). Abu Talha gave his most valuable well and garden, Bi'r Haa as%0D%0Acharity on behalf of his deceased mother. In fact, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) slaughtered 100 sheep during his farewell Hajj and made%0D%0Aintention for himself and all those (alive, deceased and to come) who bring%0D%0Afaith on his prophethood. (Nasbur Raaya, Allama Zailee). One may recite the%0D%0AQur'aan, or any Dhikr or Du'aa and make intention of giving the reward to%0D%0Athe deceased."
