It is a very sad state of affair.%0D%0A%0D%0ANevertheless do not despair in the Mercy of Allah Ta'ala, seek forgiveness sincerely in Allah Ta'ala for resorting to masturbation in these weak circumstances. Masturbation weakens the body and is detested. Focus on would you want your death to be in this state? But then how does one control passions? Fasting and don't focus too much on need to satiate desires. However express your desire to marry to friends or family to seek a suitable marriage partner. Don't just choose anyone in despair and land into another problem. Search for Deeni compatibility also. If you do not find someone do not despair it's not a disaster. Make dua, Allah Ta'ala may have saved you from worse abuse etc.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala grant you a suitable marriage partner and grant you happiness and piety, Insha Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A2SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
