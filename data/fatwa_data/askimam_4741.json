  "question": "Judgement Day, Ressurection and Qayamat!",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)You said that one of big signs of Judgement day is that Non-Muslims, Kuffars, will take over the world, Muslim places too. Does that mean there won't come a time when the whole world be Muslim? 2) And is anyone in Heaven right now because you said everyone will be judged on judgement day and then go to Heaven so are we all going to go to Heaven together? 3) WHat is the difference between the Judgement Day and the Day Of Ressurection and Qayamat? Wasalam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Frequent wars and domination of Kufr is a sign of Qiyaamat. However,\nafter Eesa (Alayhis salaam) kills Dajjaal, the entire world will be Muslims.\nThe mercy of Allah will descend on earth and there will be abundant\nblessings of Allah on earth.\n2. Every human being will be judged on the day of Qiyaamat (judgment day)\nand if a person is successful in the court of Allah, he will be granted\nentrance into Jannah. No human being will enter Jannah before the day of\njudgment.\n3. The day of resurrection refers to the day when every human being will be\ngiven life and raised from his/her grave to be judged in the court of Allah\nTa'ala - the day of judgment.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
