  "question": "Would it be correct to say that ALL the Prophets of Allah were Muslims, even those Prophets who were sent to Bani Israel, such as Musa, Isa, Dawood, Sulayman (peace be upon all of them)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWould it be correct to say that ALL the Prophets of Allah were Muslims, even those Prophets who were sent to Bani Israel, such as Musa, Isa, Dawood, Sulayman (peace be upon all of them)? The other day, a Christian claimed that Prophet Dawood (AS) was a Jew. I was wondering, would it be correct to call Prophet Dawood (AS) a Jew, in the sense that he followed the Torah (in its original form), obeyed Allah, and was a firm believer and was of'course a Prophet of Allah....not like the Jews of today, who are definitely disbelievers. Would it be correct to call any other Prophet of Allah a Jew (or a Christian) in a similar sense? Or, should we say that all the Prophets of Allah were Muslims (which of'course all of them were), and they were all believers (of'course, without a doubt), and we should not call even a single one of them a Jew or a Christian (in whatever sense these words are taken to be)? Plz help me out here.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAll the prophets (Alayhimus salaam) preaches the same message of Deen. Hence, it is correct to say that all of them were Muslims,\n\nSince the use of the word ?Jew? or ?Christian? today is synonymous to a follow of a Baatil Deen (false religion), it is incorrect to refer to the prophets as Jews or Chritians. Also, the Qur?aan declares, ?Ibraahim (Alayhis salaam) was neither a Christian nor a Jew?? (Aali Imraan 67)\n\nThis claim of the prophets being Jews or Chsritians is also refuted in Surah al-Baqarah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
