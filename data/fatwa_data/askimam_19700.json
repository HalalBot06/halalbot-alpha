  "answer": "QUESTION\nMalfooz: A courageous person is merciful and a coward is not merciful\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe Turks are brave people but they are also soft hearted. A person who commits suicide is a coward. He takes his own life because he cannot bear the trials and problems he is facing. Hazrat mentioned that there was once a person who committed suicide but the strange thing was that he did not scream or shout; this does not make him any less of a coward than a person who does scream because he is still committing the cowardly act of suicide.\n\n \n\nA person once said to Hazrat “Allah Ta’ālā has taken it upon Himself to take account of a person who commits suicide.” Hazrat replied “This is correct. It may be that Allah has excused this person. We do not know what conditions this person was going through.”"
