The competiton is entered by SMS'ing the answer to a number that is provided by those who are hosting the competiton. The SMS's are charged at R3 an SMS. The winner is determined by a draw of all the entrants and one lucky person will win. The prize is a brand new car (not money). Mr X enters the competiton.\n\nFirst Question: Has Mr X gambled ? (Remember the competion costs R3 an entry)\n\nAssume Mr X wins the competiton.\n\nSecond Question: Is the prize haraam as  result of the manner in which it has been won?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe condition for entering the competition is to SMS the answer. It is not a condition to pay money to enter the competition.\n\nThe answer being sent by SMS and the SMS costing R3 is a different issue. Therefore, Mr X did not gamble. If Mr X won the competition, the prize will be permissible for him.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
