  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI love someone which is girl and i really love her and she also love me.And we both lot of those work which are illegal in Islam..but not so for exent.sir we both at late night at the mobile talking in our golden night.Can this right.\n\nand i tell him alot of time to marry with me secertely because his parents want that the marrige cannot happen till to estabilished me..now plz tell me what is method to adopt in which we both live happly each other.we are so tenstion about this .\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWhat both of you are engaged in is clearly haraam. There is no doubt about that. The free talk between you and the girl falls in the category of Zina, which is a major sin. Your free talk with each other serves to feed your Nafs and desires. Make tawbah and come out of that situation immediately. For that, courage is required. Sincere tawbah should be made. If your’ll continue, your’ll will continue destroying your hearts and minds and wound your roohaniyyat and spirituality. Your’ll will not enjoy your salaah, and your hearts will be occupied with all this filth. Your’ll will be deprived of the mercy of Allah. In fact your sin of free talking to the girl will incur the anger and wrath of Allah. If you wish to marry her, follow procedures and get married.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n1. When the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\n2. The guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\n\n3. Education and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\n\n4. Islam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\n\n5. When one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\n\n6. Muslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\n\n7. We have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\n\n8. If you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\n\n9. If that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\n\n10. Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, \"When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit\".\n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
