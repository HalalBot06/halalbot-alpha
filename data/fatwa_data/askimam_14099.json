  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is the fatwa about a man(who is a non-muslim like christian ,jew etc)who has been working in a film industry and has gathered million of dollars.But then embraces islam,repents and leave that buisness and everything.What about the money he has collected.A mufti saheb gave a fatwa that If he was an unbeliever at the time of earning the money, he is not obliged to atone for them or seek their purification. For the ProphetÂ  (peace be upon him) did not demand from his followers that they purify their wealth after coming into the fold of Islam.So can he use that money as people normally do?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is permissible for one to keep the money he has earned in the film industry whilst he was a Kaafir. (Sharh al-Talwiy vol.1 pg.536)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
