  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nOne of my Pakistani friend is saying that Indian Muslims are not true Muslims as they not migrated to Pakistan and accepted Hindu Leadership. Is this thinking true? I am not agree to this as we have full freedom to follow our Islam.\nIs there any Hadith prohibiting us to say Kafir to a Muslim who is not Praying and fasting but has full faith in Islam and beliefs are correct?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n\n1.  To make statements about another person’s īmān is no light matter.  The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم warned,\n\nوحدثنا يحيى بن يحيى التميمى ويحيى بن أيوب وقتيبة بن سعيد وعلى بن حجر جميعا عن إسماعيل بن جعفر قال يحيى بن يحيى أخبرنا إسماعيل بن جعفر عن عبد الله بن دينار أنه سمع ابن عمر يقول قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أيما امرئ قال لأخيه يا كافر فقد باء بها أحدهما إن كان كما قال وإلا رجعت عليه\n\n(صحيح مسلم، كتاب الإيمان، باب بيان حال إيمان من قال لأخيه المسلم يا كافر: 1/56؛ الجيل)\n\nWhoever calls his brother, “O Disbeliever,” then this statement will apply on one of them.  If his brother is as he said (i.e. a disbeliver), then it will apply to him.  However, if he is not such, then the statement will return to the one who made the statement (Muslim)\n\n \n\nDespite the grave warning, it is surprising that your friend can make a comment on the īmān of so many Muslims.  In addition, the migration was not compulsory.  For this reason, several great ‘ulamā’  remained in India after the partition.  If every single Muslim had migrated to Pakistan after the partition, Islām would not have remained in India and it would have been a great disservice to Islām. \n\n \n\n2.  Prayer and fasting are amongst the pillars of Islām, and to leave them is a major sin.  Despite the magnitude of the sin, it is still impermissible to call him a kāfir (disbeliver). \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
