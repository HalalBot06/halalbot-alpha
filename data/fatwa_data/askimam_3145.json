  "question": "I am looking to study in an institute in the Arab world to become Aalim and was wondering whether you can give me some mashwara about the best place to study.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs salam mu alaikum Mufti saheb. I would like to learn arabic to a degree of understanding the quran clearly.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nHasan Basri (RA) said, 'Verily, this knowledge is religion and be careful\nfrom who you seek your religion.'\n\nIn view of the above, we advise you exercise extreme precaution in choosing\nyour place of study. The teachers should have Taqwa (piety) and strictly\nadhere to Shari'ah in their personal lives. Generally, students are a\nreflection of their teachers. We cannot comment on any institute in the Arab\nworld as we have no knowledge on the quality of Imaan and Taqwa of their\nteachers. However, Arabic is also taught in non-Arab countries as well, for\nexample, in Darul Ulooms in South Africa and England.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
