  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat are you this hadith think?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Hadith in question probably is the incident when Musa (Alayhis salaam)\nclouted the angel of death. If so, the Hadith is authentic.\n\nThe general question posed is how was it possible for Musa (Alayhis salaam)\nto clout the angel of death and damage the angel's eye. The answer is\nsimple. The angel of death came in the form of a human being and was\npersonified with the characteristic of a human being, hence, the pain and\ndamage of the eye.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
