  "question": "Brother & his wife who care more about money & materialistic issues rather than their relationship with siblings/parents.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs-Salaam Alaikum, I have an older brother who is married. He has this bad habit of bringing in money matters in every single issue he discusses and it has come down to the point that I have stopped talking to him for more than 2 years. Not only does he mention money, he also likes pass hurtful remarks. His wife, who is educated & mature enough to guide my brother to do the right thing, says nothing whatsoever. She herself is very materialistic and prefers to mingle more with friends than be nice with her in-laws. What should I do in such a case? I tried to call once and left a message however, they did not bother calling back. Please advise me regarding this problem.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssalaamu Alaykum wa Rahmatullaahi wa Barakaatuhu\n\nShariah has emphasised on maintaining family ties. Rsulullah (Sallallaahu\nalayhi wa sallam) said - maitaining family ties is a means of blessings in\none's life and sustenance. To severe family ties is a major sin and invokes\nthe anger of Allah.\n\nIf your brother and his wife do not maitain ties with you or do not treat\nyou well, they will be sinful. However, you should not respond to them as\nthey do to you. Insha Allah you will be rewarded abundantly.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti E Desai\nFatwa Dept.\n_____________"
