  "question": "A business account runs into overdraft,and interest is deducted from it.Sufficient funds then accumalate and interest is added to it.May the second sum of interest be used in lieu of the first?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, we wish to state that it is not permissible to take an\ninterest bearing loan as is the case in an overdraft situation. It is not\npermissible to accumulate funds to generate interest.\n\nHowever, the accumulated interest on funds may be used to offset interest\ncharged from the same bank, for example, both accounts are in Standard Bank.\nIf one account in Standard Bank and the other is at another bank, the\ninterest earned from one cannot be used to offset interest charges at\nanother bank.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
