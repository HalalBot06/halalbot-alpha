  "question": "To become a citizen of US one has to take an oath of allegiance. is it ok to take the oath.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe oath of allegiance is as follows: I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God. They also ask on the citizenship form the following questions: If the law requires it, are you willing to bear arms on behalf of US? If the law requires it, are you willing to perform noncombatant service in the US Armed Forces? If the law requires it, are you willing to perform work of national importance under civilian direction? My question is can we answer yes to these questions? is there anything wrong in doing that. what should the answer be: yes or no? could you please kindly give an urgent answer. jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs Muslims, we are duty bound to follow our lives strictly according to Shari?ah. Whatever Shari?ah allows us to do, we will abide by that and whatever Shari?ah has restricted us from, we will refrain from it. Hence, we are not allowed to obey anybody if it is resulting in the disobedience of the Creator, Allah. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?There is no obedience for the creation by disobeying the Creator.? (Mirqaat vol.7 pg.217; Imdadiyyah).\n\nHence, keeping this in mind if one is forced to sign the above in order to become a citizen or the only way of attaining citizenship is by acknowledging the above, then one may sign it with the intention that Shari?ah and Deen will always be his yardstick and that he will never sacrifice any of the teachings of Deen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
