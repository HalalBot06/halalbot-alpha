  "question": "Could you please quote some authentic Hadith regarding the trousers being above the ankles for male Muslim believers, and why is it necessary?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDespite the stern warnings of Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) concerning the wearing of the trouser below the ankle, some Muslim men totally disregard this Sunnah. In fact, many argue that this applies to a person who wears it below the ankle if pride settles in the heart.%0D%0A%0D%0AHaving said that, it is therefore undisputed by all that wearing the trousers below the ankle with pride is a major sin. And if worn without pride then too it is a major sin. (Alamgeri), except that should the trouser unintentionally drop below the ankle then there is no sin. This was the case of Hazrat Abu Baker (Radhiallahu Anhu) for which Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) excused him. It is indeed sad to note that some people of the Ummah disregard its importance and largely take it for granted.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe warnings admonished by Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) are explicit and direct. We cite a few hereunder:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said, 'That which hangs below the ankle, will be in Jahannam. (Bukhari)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Once Hazrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiallahu anhu) entered the gathering of Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam). He says, 'My trouser was hanging a little below my ankle when Rasulullah asked, \"who is this\"? 'I replied, Abdullah bin Umar'. Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said, 'If you are Abdullah then raise your trouser above the ankle.' I immediately did likewise to the extent of half my shin. From that day onwards I formed a habit to wear my trouser above the ankle. (Musnad Ahmad)%0D%0AIt is reported in a hadith that three people whom Allah Ta'ala will not talk to nor look at and for them will be a terrible punishment. The narrator says that Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) repeated this three times. Then Hazrat Abu zar Ghaffari (Radhiallahu anhu) commented saying that these people are indeed very unfortunate but who are they? Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said that person who hangs his trouser below the ankle, that person who does good deeds and lies and that person who takes a false oath to sell his goods. (Abu Dawood)%0D%0A%0D%0AExplaining the situation Hazrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiallahu anhu) says that the meaning of Rasulullah's (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) warnings refer to anything that hangs below the ankle i.e. when wearing the lungi or long abayya kurtas.%0D%0AAt this point, it will suffice to say that our beloved Nabi (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) has presented a certain code of conduct (which forms part of the Sunnah) and should we claim to love Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) then follow his way - the only way for our salvation in this world and the hereafter.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
