  "question": "What should be the postion of feet in sajdah during salat (prayer)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat should be the postion of feet in sajdah during salat (prayer)?\n\nSomebody told me that in sajdah the left foot should be moved closer to right foot and in this postion the direction of fingers should be towards qiblah? Is this the masnoon way of positioning feet in sajdah; kindly guide.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nThe sunnah method of positioning the feet in Sajdah is to keep the feet close to each other and face all the toes towards the Qiblah.\n\nIt is incorrect to place the top end of the feet instead of the toes or to keep the feet hanging in the air.\n\nIt is also not desirable to keep only one foot on the ground unless there is a valid reason.\n\n\nReferences :\nRadul-Muhtar Vol 1, pg 493 (H.M.
