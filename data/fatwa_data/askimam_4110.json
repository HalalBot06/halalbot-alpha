  "question": "my wife could not fast the whole month due to the delivery blood (nifas). If she can't make up the fasting this year, can she make it up next year? jazakallahu khair",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nass. wr. wb. respected mufti shaheb.... my wife delivered our baby last year, on the 2nd day of Ramadhan. Therefore, she could not fast the whole month due to the blood (nifas). She hasn't make up the fasting until now, but she had already paid some fidyah last year. At the same time she is breastfeeding our baby (just recently she got pregnant our second baby). If she can't make up the fasting this year, can she make it up next year? How about her breastfeeding? (or another pregnancy?) jazakallahu khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, a female may make up her missed fasts any time during her\nlifetime. However, it is advisable for her not to delay making up her missed\nfasts unnecessarily as death is imminent.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
