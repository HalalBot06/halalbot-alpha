  "question": "Wearing clothes while standing, seated.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAn Alim mentioned that there are two positions for putting on garments. When you put on the lower garment (trouser/pyjama/shalwar), do so in a sitting position, not standing up. This should always be done, with the exception of the dhoti, since you cannot put this on while sitting. This rule applies to both men and women. When winding the turban, this too should be done standing up. If you do otherwise, it is stated in a Hadeeth that you will get a disease for which there is no cure. That is, if you knowingly do the reverse - putting on the Imamah while sitting down and the shalwar/pyjama while standing - then you will get an incurable disease. Is this true?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe have not come across any Shar?ee reference of the above. Probably, the advise of the respected Moulana is based on Tajruba (experience) of people.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
