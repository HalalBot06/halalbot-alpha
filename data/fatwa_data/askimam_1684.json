  "question": "My brother and his wife are not a practising Muslim. He keeps fast but doesn't eat halal. I know he'll be inviting us to iftar but I'm afraid of eating.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI wish to have a good relations with sister in law and will try to make dawah but how can I reject their invitation & still be respected? I don't want to break their hearts by declining but I'm not willing to bend my beliefs for their indifference.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour approach is correct and commendable. It is important to maintain family\nties and that will be conducive to your intention of making dawah to them.\nWe suggest you request them to prepare a vegetable dish or a seafood dish as\nyou are abstaining from meat products due to medical reasons.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
