Islam is a religion of cleanliness and etiquette. Long nails generally attract dirt and breeds bacteria. Apart from long nails being unhygienic, it is also a source of demean. Nevertheless, according to Shariah if the dirt accumulated inside the nail prevents the water of Wudhu from reaching the inner portion of the nail, the Wudhu will be invalid. It will be necessary to then clean the dirt and repeat the Wudhu.\n\nApart from the above, women also keep long nails as a form of beatification for their husbands and they apply certain cosmetics on them. If the cosmetics prevent the water from reaching the nail, the Wudhu will be invalid.\n\n2. It is against Adab and ettiquitte for someone to be seated higher than the Quraan. The Quraan is the word of Allah and deserves the utmost respect. Therefore, the person reciting the Quraan should sit on the bed/chair or the person seated higher than the Quraan could be requested to sit down.\n\n3. it is not permissible to recite any portion of the Quraan while experiencing menses. However, there are certain verses of the Quraan that are recited as Duas. If those verses are recited with the intention of making Dua, it will be permiisble to recite them.\n\n4. It is not permissible to make Dua while in Salaah, other than those that are mentioned in the Quraan and Hadith. One should complete the Salaah and thereafter make whatever Dua one desires.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
