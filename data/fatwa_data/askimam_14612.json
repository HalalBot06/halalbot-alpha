  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs-Salaam Alaikum Respected Mufti Sahib,\n\nMashallah, I have been blessed with 2 wonderful daughters, and I love them dearly. My husband and I would try to have a baby boy.  Is there any dua that we can recite so that Allah SWT can bless us with a son?  Your assistance would be truly appreciated.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nIt was also the wish and desire of the parents of Mariam (AS) to have a son. Allah instead blessed them with Mariam (AS). One of the most revered women in Islam. It is upto Allah to grant a son or a daughter. Continue making Dua and Allah will grant you whatever is best for you.  \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
