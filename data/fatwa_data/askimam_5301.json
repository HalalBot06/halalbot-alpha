  "question": "Is it wrong to promise to marry a girl in a few years because we don't want to go against Islam by dating?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI met a girl at school that I really like, but we both know that dating is against Islam. To avoid this, we decided that we will refrain from dating but promised to get together in a few years and discuss marriage.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nEither get married immediately, or totally cut this lady out of your life.\nThe lingering notion of taking her as your wife in the distant future is\nharmful.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
