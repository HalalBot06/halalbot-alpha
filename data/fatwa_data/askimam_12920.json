  "question": "In Hanafi madhab an excused person's wudu lasts as long as the prayer time. Can you also touch Quran during this time?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOnce a person is classified a Shari' Ma'zoor (excused person), his wudhu will last for the entire salaah time as long as he did not break the wudhu. It is permissible for him to hold the Quraan while being a Ma'zoor. (Tahtaawi)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
