  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat should a common muslim should do what in the condition if he finds two different fatwas regarding one subject. e. g. regarding alcohol in perfumes, or regarding electronic pictures (such as on mobile phones) etc.\n\nsecondly i want toknow what should we do if ingredients written on a food item do not tell the details of its origin e.g. whey powder or emuusifier that can be from halal or haram source.  I have read somewhere there is probabilty to use such items. what is your opinion.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1.       If there are opposing fatwas on any issue, for example one fatwa state that it is permissible and the other states that it is not permissible and both fatwas are from reliable sources and competent Muftis and also academically substantiated, the one should follow the ruling of the prohibition and abstain. (Darse-Tirmizi, Mufti Taqi Usmani, vol 4- Kitabul Buyoo)  This is also understood from other principles of fiqh.\n\nIf the alcohol in perfumes is synthetic, it is permissible. Electronic pictures are potentially durable, therefore generally Electronic pictures are generally prohibited.\n\n2.       A Muslim should exercise precaution in what he eats. If the source of the ingredient is not stated, and there is a possibility of it being haram, one should exercise precaution.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
