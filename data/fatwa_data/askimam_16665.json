  "question": "According to the Hanafi Madhab, it is permissible to consume only fish from the sea",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have had two Maulana (Hanafi) here in the US tell me that the only food we can consume from the sea is fish and shrimp. I have heard otherwise from other scholars who are outside the US. How do I decide what to do as I have been eating shrimp for many years now thinking that it was haraam according to the Shafi Mathab.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, it is permissible to consume only fish from the sea. As for shrimps, some Ulama hold the view that it is a fish and Halal whilst some other Ulama hold a view to the contrary. Therefore, abstaining from it will be considered as an act of Taqwa and one will be rewarded accordingly. However, if one consumes it there will be some leeway.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Ishaq E. Moosa,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
