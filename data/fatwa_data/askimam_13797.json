  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI heard that there is a hadeeth in this way:\n\nThat Nabi SAW to Aisha R.A said: O Aisha don't sleep before you made hatm of the quran, before you made tawaf of the kaba, before you satisfied al mumins,and before you get shafaat of every prophet on this Aisha R.A. said , Rasulullah how can i read in one night the whole quran, and make tawaf of kaba and satisfie every mumin, and get shafaat of every prophet?\n\nThen Nabi SAW said. Surah Ikhlaas is one third of quran if you read it 3x then you made hatm of quran, say Subhanallahi wal hamdulillah ve la ilaha ill allahu wallahu ekber wela hawla wela kuwwata illa billahil aliyyil azim then you have made tawaf around kaba, say Rabbanagfirlie waliewalideyya ve lil muminina yawma yekoomool hisaab then you have satisfied every mumin. Read this durood (then he named a durood which contains the names of every ulu azam prophet) then you have get shafaa of the prophets.\n\nCan you provide me the actual text in english of this hadeeth and the source and how this hadeeth is classified?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nA Hadith can only be practiced upon if it has an acceptable chain of narrators even though the purport may be good. After a thorough and extensive search and consultation with reputable scholars, the original source could not be traced.\n\nIt could not be found in any book of Hadith nor in any of the books that gather fabricated Ahaadith. Therefore, until the authenticity of this Hadith cannot be established with a valid chain of narrators, it cannot be accepted. If you witness anyone quoting this Hadith, request them to produce its source for our perusal.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
