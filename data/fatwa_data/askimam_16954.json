  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalaammu'Alaikum, respected Mufti... I need help.  I've been married for 20 years but day by day I can't seem to live with my husband anymore.  We have lots of problem but I feel it's mostly me.  He's a very good husband but I don't have the love for him anymore.  We don't have children and our personal relationship is really bad.  I don't know if someone's done some Jadu on us or not.  I just seem to not able to get along with my husband.  We argue most of the time.  I'm so lost.  I can't even type down what I needed to say.  Please, help me.  Wassalaam\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:"
