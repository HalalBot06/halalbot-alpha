  "question": "How should a woman's feet be during sajdah (prostration)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am very confused about this matter. I was told a womans feet during sajda should be towards the right side. However, someone else who also follows the hanafi fiqh said the womans feet should be at the back and errect, toe fingers pointing towards the qibla. Can you please tell me which is the correct answer, do you have any evidence? JazkAllah kair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn the Shariat, although certain forms of Ibaadat (worship) are done both by%0D%0Amen and women, yet the manner in which these forms of Ibaadat are fulfilled%0D%0Adiffer. This is especially apparent in Salaat. Many postures of the Salaat%0D%0Aof women differ to that of men in order to maintain the very important%0D%0Aprinciple of modesty and concealment. Many narrations substantiate this%0D%0Afact.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said: \"When a woman sits in Salaat, she should%0D%0Aplace the thighs (of one leg) upon the other and when she makes sajdah, she%0D%0Ashould attach her belly to her thigh so that it is as concealing as%0D%0Apossible. For indeed Allah Ta'ala looks at her saying: 'O my angels I make%0D%0Ayou witness that I have indeed forgiven her'.\" (Baihaqi Vol.2 Pg.223)%0D%0A%0D%0AWaail bin Hujr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) says that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) said: \"O Waail, when you commence the Salaat, lift your hands in%0D%0Aline with your ears and women should (only) lift it in line with the chest%0D%0A(shoulders).\" (Kanzul Umaal Vol.7 Pg.307)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another narration, it is stated that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) passed by two women who were performing Salaat. He said: \"When you%0D%0Amake sajdah, attach your body to the ground. Indeed women are not like men%0D%0Ain this matter.\" (i.e. they differ in the posture of sajdah). (Maraasil of%0D%0AImaam Abu Dawood (R.A))%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Imaams of all four Mazaahib (schools of thought) attest to the%0D%0Adifferences between the Salaat of men and women.%0D%0A%0D%0AThus, we will now discuss a few aspects pertaining exclusively to the Salaat%0D%0Aof women.%0D%0A* Before commencing the Salaat, a woman must ensure that besides her face%0D%0Aand wrists, all other parts of her body should be concealed. Some women%0D%0Aperform Salaat with their hair exposed, others with their ears exposed,%0D%0Awhile the forearms of others are completely open. Some wear such a thin%0D%0A(see-through) burqa' (head covering) that the hair can be seen through it.%0D%0AAll this is incorrect and not permissible%0D%0A* If any limb, besides the face and wrists are exposed for the duration it%0D%0Atakes to read thrice, the Salaat will be rendered null and void. If it is%0D%0Aexposed less than that, the Salaat will be valid. However it will be makrooh%0D%0Aand she will be sinful.%0D%0A* It is best for women to perform Salaat in a place that is most concealing.%0D%0AThus to perform Salaat in an inner room of the house will be better than%0D%0Aperforming it in the front room or lounge etc. Similarly performing the%0D%0ASalaat in the lounge will be preferred to performing it in the courtyard of%0D%0Athe house.%0D%0A* Whilst saying the Takbeer-a-Tahrima (Allahu Akbar), women will only lift%0D%0Atheir hands till the shoulders and not till the ears like men. They will%0D%0Alift the hands under the burqa (veil). They should not take their hands out%0D%0Aof the burqa.%0D%0A* Women will put their hands on the chest by placing the palm of the right%0D%0Ahand over the back of the left wrist. The fingers should be kept close%0D%0Atogether. Women will not adopt the method of men in placing of the hands.%0D%0A(Tahtawi Pg.141)%0D%0A* Women should stand with both feet close together. There should be no gap%0D%0Abetween the two feet. In ruku also, the same position of the feet should be%0D%0Amaintained. (Bahishti Zewar & Mufti Taqi Uthmani)%0D%0A* First make the intention, then say Allahu Akbar. Thereafter place the%0D%0Ahands on the chest. Then read Thanaa, A'uzu, and Bismillah after which you%0D%0Awill commence with Surah Fateha. On completing Surah Fateha, say A'meen.%0D%0AAfter that, read Bismillah again and read a Surah. After completing the%0D%0ASurah, say Allahu Akbar and go into ruku.%0D%0A* A woman should only bend so much in ruku that she is able to place the%0D%0Ahands on the knees. Women will not make ruku like men by straightening the%0D%0Aback. Their bending for ruku should be less than that of men. Place both%0D%0Ahands on the knees while keeping the fingers closed together. Do not spread%0D%0Athe fingers apart. (Tahtawi Pg.141 & Bahishti Zewar)%0D%0A* Keep the forearms close to the sides and keep the ankles together in ruku.%0D%0A(Ibid)%0D%0A* In ruku, women will not keep the feet completely upright, but rather they%0D%0Awill bend the knees slightly forward. (Shaami & Mufti Taqi Uthmani)%0D%0A* Read three or five times in ruku. Ensure that the 'dh' is pronounced%0D%0Acorrectly.%0D%0A* After saying , lift the head and stand with ease and read or%0D%0A* Sahih Muslim%0D%0A* Women will make sajdah in such a way that the belly will touch the thighs%0D%0Aand the forearms will touch the sides. The forearms will be placed on the%0D%0Aground. Bahishti Zewar%0D%0A* Place the head between the hands in sajdah. Place the forehead and the%0D%0Anose on the ground. The fingers should be kept close together, facing the%0D%0AQibla. The thumb should also face the Qibla.%0D%0A* In sajdah both feet will be placed on the ground facing the right. The%0D%0Afeet should not be kept upright. However, the toes should face the Qibla.%0D%0Ashould be read three or five times.%0D%0A* Thereafter say Allahu Akbar and sit with ease. Sit on the left posterior%0D%0Awith both feet protruding to the right. Place the right thigh on the left%0D%0Athigh and the right shin on the left one. (Tahtawi Bahishti Zewar)%0D%0A* Place both hands on the thighs with the fingers closed together. This is%0D%0Athe method for women. In ruku, sajdah and qa'adah, the fingers will be kept%0D%0Aclose together without any gap in between, while the law for men is that in%0D%0Aruku they will keep the fingers apart and in sajdah they will keep it closed%0D%0Atogether. In all the other postures, the fingers will be kept in their%0D%0Anatural position.%0D%0A* In jalsah the following duaa should be read, whether performing a fardh,%0D%0Asunnah or nafl Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to read this duaa. (Tirmizi &%0D%0AAbu Dawood & Haakim)%0D%0A* Thereafter the second sajdah should be made in the same manner as the%0D%0Afirst sajdah was done. Thereafter stand up whilst saying Allahu Akbar. Do%0D%0Anot take support with the hands while standing up. Then read Bismillah and%0D%0ASurah Fateha. Upon ending Surah Fateha, say A'ameen. Thereafter Bismillah%0D%0Aand a Surah will be read. (Behishti Zewar)%0D%0A* Sit in the qa'adah posture after completing two raka'ats. The manner of%0D%0Asitting is the same as that of jalsah. Read At-Tahiyat and when reaching%0D%0AAsh-hadu-al laailaaha illallaahu, join the small and ring finger and and%0D%0Aattach their tips to the palms and form a ring with the middle finger and%0D%0Athe thumb. Lift the index finger, indicating to the oneness of Allah Ta'ala.%0D%0ADrop the index finger when reaching illallaahu. However the other fingers%0D%0Awill remain as is%0D%0A* If it is a Salaat of two raka'at, then maintain this posture till the end.%0D%0ARead the Salawaat (durood) and duaa and thereafter make salaam. If it is a%0D%0ASalaat of four raka'at, stand up immediately after completing the%0D%0AAt-Tahiyaat.%0D%0A* In the third and fourth raka'at also, read Bismillah before commencing%0D%0ASurah Fateha. If it is a Fardh Salaat, go into ruku after completing Surah%0D%0AFateha. However in the Witr, Sunnat or Nafl Salaat one will read a Surah%0D%0Aafter Surah Fateha.%0D%0A* After completing the final qa'adah, say the salaam while turning the head%0D%0Atowards the right. Commence the salaam with the face in the direction of the%0D%0AQibla. Complete the salaam when the face is fully turned to the right. Then%0D%0Abring the face back towards the Qibla and commence the second salaam from%0D%0Athere. Turn the face towards the left as you say the second salaam. Do not%0D%0Acommence the second salaam whilst the head is turned towards the right. Face%0D%0Athe Qibla, then commence the second salaam. Whilst making both the salaams,%0D%0Amake the intention of greeting the angels.%0D%0A* It is Makrooh (reprehensible) for women to perform Salaat in jamaat%0D%0A(congregation). They should perform their Salaat individually. However if%0D%0Athe Mahram males (i.e. those men with whom one cannot get married eg.%0D%0Abrothers, father, grandfather etc.) are performing Salaat with jamaat in the%0D%0Ahouse, a woman can join that jamaat. She will stand behind the men. She%0D%0Ashould not stand in line with the men. (Mufti Taqi Uthmaani)%0D%0A%0D%0AWomen should read their five daily Salaat, Taraweeh and Witr Salaat%0D%0Aindividually. It is Maakrooh Tahrimi for them to perform Salaat with jamaat.%0D%0A(Shaami Vol.1 Pg.418 & Fataawa Rahimia Vol.1 Pg.347)%0D%0A%0D%0AShaykhul Hadith Mawlana Fadhlur Rahmaan Saheb%0D%0A%0D%0AKindly refer to www.alinaam.org.za%2Flibrary%2Fscorrect18.htm%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
