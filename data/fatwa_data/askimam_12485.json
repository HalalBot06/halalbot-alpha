  "answer": "QUESTION\n1.) Can a woman wear a skirt with medium to large sized red flowers on them; can a woman wear red/bright colors if they are broken up (i.e. as flowers/patterns/stripes)? 2.) Can Muslims use cleaning solutions (i.e. detergents, sprays, dishwashing fluids, vinigars, window/car cleaners, wipes/tissues, etc.) even if there are animal products, alcohol and other haram ingredients in them if they are only used to clean surfaces/clothes/dishes/etc. and NOT used on the body/taken orally? 3.) I have a dry cleaning product, Dryel. I manufacturer told me it had no animal/alcohol products in it. But it does contain a fragrance which MAY contain alcohol in it. Can I still use the product because it is just going to be used on clothing? The products will go through ONLY ONE drying cycle. Can I use this product to dryclean my clothing even if it contains haram ingredients?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. A woman can wear bright-coloured clothing however these should not be worn in front of strangers.\n\n2.Cleaning solutions containing alcohol could be used as the alcohol in these is not synthetic. Products containing animal products cannot be used as instead of cleaning the item, they would render it impure.\n\n3. If the fragrance contains a synthetic alcohol, then it would be permissible to use it.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl.
