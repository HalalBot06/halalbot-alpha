  "question": "Is it true that if one pays Zakaat every year, then he will not see any loss or reduction in his wealth?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease explain this and quote any related Hadith.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala says, '(O Muhammad) Take from their (rich) wealth Sadaqah\n(Zakaat), you may purify them (by them) giving Zakaat and make Du'aas of\nmercy for them. Verily, your Du'aa is a means of peace for them.\n\nHadhrat ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu\nAlayhi Wasallam) said, 'Zakaat is not made compulsory but so that your\nremaining wealth (after discharging Zakaat) remains pure.' (Mishkaat pg.156;\nQadeemi)\n\nIt is clear from the aforegoing that, when one discharges his/her Zakat,\nthat is a means of purifying (their wealth and soul). Pure wealth is in the\nprotection of Allah and always yields blessings and Barkaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
