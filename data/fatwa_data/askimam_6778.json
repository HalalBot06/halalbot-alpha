  "question": "Aalim has proved thru his research that Aishaâ€™s (Rad.) age was not 9 at the time of her marriage, she was 19. one of the Raavi, due to weak memory started giving false hadith",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) I got up to make up 2 Rakaats missed in Isha Salaat after the Salaam and made a mistake (which requires Sajdah Sawh to compensate). Should I make Sajdah Sawh for the mistake or should I complete my Salaat since I did my Salaat behind Imam. 2) Is Istikhara still necessary even if I?m confident that certain action will benefit me? Isn?t Istikhara for something that we are not able to decide? One brother told me that I should still be doing Istikhara. 3) One Aalim from India has proved thru his research that Hazrat Ayesha?s (Rad.) age was not 9 at the time of her marriage to Rasulallah (Sallahu Alaihi Wa Sallam). He claims that previous Ulama never ventured on his kind of research. He says she was 19 and that one of the Raavi, who was relative of Ayesha (Rad.), in his old age, migrated to Iraq and started giving false Ahadiths (due to weak memory). My father is impressed by his research and I don?t know how to convince him. Please give detailed reply to this one. My father is impressed by his research and I don?t know how to convince him. Please give detailed reply to this one.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If you made a mistake while performing the missed Rakaats, then you must compensate for that by making Sajdah-e-Sahw.\n\n2. It is advisable to make Mashwara (consult) and/or make Istikhaara in all major issues even if one is confident. Our knowledge and insight is limited. The guidance of Allah Ta?ala is perfect and absolute.\n\n3. Hadhrat Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha) was married at the age of six. The Ahaadith pertaining to this are in Bukhari and Muslim, all the narrators of these Ahaadith are authentic.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
