  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nmy wife is breastfeeding our 9 month daughter, while being aroused i sucked her nipple and drank some milk not intentionally. Is our marriage null. HOW CAN I REPAIR the situation as it was the spur of the moment.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIt is prohibited for the husband to drink the wife’s breast milk.\n\nHowever, that does not invalidate the Nikah. You should make taubah and Istighfar for your sinful act and resolve never to repeat that in future.\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla knows best\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
