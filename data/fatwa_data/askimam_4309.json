  "question": "What are \"Hasad\" and \"Najish\"? Please quote the Ahadith relating to this.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHasad means jealously which is haraam (strictly prohibited). Jealousy in a person is a sign of his faith being weak as Allah grants good and virtue to whoever He wish to. Every person should be happy with the decision of Allah. Among the duas of Rasulullah (S.A.W), one was, Oh Allah save me from the evil of the jealous person. We do not know what is meant by Najish.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
