  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam o alikum, Jazaak al khair for your answer regarding question 1423, but i'm afraid i finally cannot find myself resourceful and capable enough to preserve my islamic values and principles as you yourself said, this society has totally been very pressing, but i've prevented myself form breaking any religious and country laws by far, alhumdulillah, but i cannot bear too much. I\"m becoming mentally ill which is affecting myself too much, please help me out, i just need Allah's guidance whether i can leave this country or not. I hope Islam never bounds ourselves to any geographical boundries and never bounds any one not to leave native land forever.I've developed psychic problems living here, that's why i asked you, may Allah give you reward for this, AAMIN. Wassalam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDue to the circumstances explained by you, you may migrate but protect your Ieman wherever you go.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti E Desai\nFatwa Dept."
