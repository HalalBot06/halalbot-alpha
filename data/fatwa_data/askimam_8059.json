  "question": "I live with my mother and she has a very low income, now I know interest is prohibited, but is it okay for us to receive interest from banks only up until I get a job?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would appreciate if you answer these questions: 1.) I live with my mother and she has a very low income, now I know interest is prohibited, but is it okay for us to receive interest from banks only up until I get a job? Because I am pursuing higher studies right now and its impossible to find a job at this age to make a living. The only way we will be able to make ends meet if we receive this interest from the bank. Inshallah when I get a job after getting my degree I will definitely get rid of this. So is it okay in this dire situation? 2.) You have said that wearing pants below ankle is a sin, whether with or without pride. How do explain the following Ahadeeth: Allah's Apostle said, 'Allah will not look at the person who drags his garment (behind him) out of conceit.'' (Buhkari volume 7, book 72, number 674.) and The Prophet said Allah will not look, on the Day of Resurrection at the person who drags his garment (behind him) out of conceit. On that Abu Bakr said, \"O Allah's Apostle! One side of my Izar hangs low if I do not take care of it.\" The Prophet said, 'You are not one of those who do that out of conceit.\" (Bukhari, volume 7, book 72, number 675.) 3.) Is it permissible to just wipe ones cotton socks if one already had Wudu before wearing the socks? 4.) Can you please give me a direct contact address or email for Taqi Uthmani Seheb?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If you and your mother are eligible to accept Zakaat, then both of you will be eligible to accept interest monies as the avenues of disposing off interest monies is the poor and needy.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Kindly refer below our standard reply to similar queries%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Kindly refer attached ? Masah%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Mufti Taqi Usmani Saheb may be contacted c%2Fo editor%40albalagh.net%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0AUndoubtedly, anything done out of pride is impermissible and effectively renders a person sinful. Allah Ta?ala states in the noble Qur?aan, ?Verily, he (Allah) does not like the proud ones.? (an-Nahl)%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, ?that person who has an iota of pride will not enter Jannah.? (Sahih Muslim vol.1 pg.25). Hence, if a person commits an act of virtue out of pride, it would be totally incorrect.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, since this is something to do with a person?s intention of the heart, and this is hidden from mankind, it would be difficult to apply a general rule since the reasons and intentions of people vary quite extensively. Furthermore, the assumption of wearing the pants below the ankles not remaining a symbol of pride does not affect its Karaahat due to the fact that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has said, ?Do not lower your garments (over your ankles), for verily, this is because of pride.?%0D%0A%0D%0AThus, it is established that this is in itself an act of pride and sin, and it will remain so through time. In yet another narration, recorded in Sahih ibn Hibbaan, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has informed us that, ?Verily Allah does not love those who lower their garments below their ankles.? Hafiz ibnul Qayyim (RA) says that it is not permissible for a person to lower his ankles and claim that he has no pride due to the fact that the prohibition by Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is general. He also states that such an act is, in fact, an indication of his pride. Hafiz ibn Hajar (RA) has also attested to this in his renowned work of Sahih Bukhari (vol.10 pg.325)"
