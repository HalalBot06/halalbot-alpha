  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. As Muslims, we believe that Jannat (heaven) and Jahannum (hell) are\ncreated by Allah and are the manifestations of Allah's mercy and punishment\nrespectively. There are 100 stages of Jannah, the highest being Jannatul\nFirdaws from where the four streams of water, milk, honey and wine flow.\nThere are many stages of Jahannum. Disbelievers and sinful people will be\npunished in Jahannum according to the severity of their sins. We are not\naware of seven heavens and seven hells.\n2. It is not permissible to perform Dhuhr Salaat before or at noon.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
