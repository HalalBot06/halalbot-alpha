  "question": "1. Is TV allowed as a form of relaxing? 2.Even During puberty, is masturbation still considered haram?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1.Even During puberty, is masturbation still considered haram? Wouldn't fasting to diminish sexual power be harmful to the teenage body since it could damage full growth into an adult? 2. Is it ok to put a picture of a deceased muslim on his gravestone in Islam? 3.Is TV allowed to watch for relaxing, becuase the imam at the masjid I go to said it is allowed when one is tired and needs to relax?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. TV\n\n2. It is Haraam (strictly prohibited) to masturbate. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu\nAlayhi Wasallam) advised the youth to marry if they have the ability to do\nso. If they are unable to marry, then they should fast. The purpose of\nfasting is not to diminish one's sexual power. It is to suppress one's base\ndesires. Any logic against the Hadith and advise of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu\nAlayhi Wasallam) is not considered. Refer attached.\n\n3. It is not permissible to put a picture of the deceased on his grave.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
