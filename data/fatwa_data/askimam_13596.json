  "question": "what time do we have to open the fast. If fajr starts at 6 am- then should we stop eating 5,10 or 30 mins before 6 am",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI wanted to know what time do we have to open the fast.  If fajr starts at 6 am- then should we stop eating 5,10 or 30 mins before 6 am.  And if you are pregnant but you didnt make up your fast from the last year ramadan before you got pregnant, is it a sin if you dont make up the fasts from last year because of difficulty resulting from pregnancy.  Can i make them up along with this years fasting when i am not pregnant?  Jazakallah Khair\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to Shariah, one will break the fast at sunset or Maghrib. If the fajr time starts at 6am then one could eat till just before this. However, it is advisable to exercise caution and stop well ahead of time.\n\nIt is not permissible to offer the Qadah for last years fast this year. You may keep them after Ramadaan. However, this year's fast will be valid if you did not keep last years Qadah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
