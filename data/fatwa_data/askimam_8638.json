  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) Now a days people have stopped going to kwankah and also many don't have the knowledge of tasawwuf, now plz prescribe some of the methods that this interest can be brought in ummah and each and every one can go to good spiritual guide. 2)In one of the saying of Moulana Abrarul Haq it has been written that \"FOR EVERY SIN THERE IS A DIFFERENT METHOD OF REPENTACE\" please explain the sentence in detail and if possible list some big sins and explain the way of repenting(tawbah). as the ummah is in need of this. 3) Please do pray for me that i can fought against nafs. 4) Can i do bayyat on you, or on a murshid who is nearer to me so that i can visit oftenly and meet him.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The fundamental cause of this decline is that the Ummah become weakened in their faith and conviction on Allah. We have to again remind ourselves who we are and where we belong to. It is unfair that we who know about Tasawwuf and the other tenets of Deen, sit complacent and just debate or share views on why the Ummah is like this or like that. It is our responsibility to take this blessed Deen to others as well.\n\n2. Moulana Abrar-ul-Haq Saheb has rated this in context. It is incorrect for us to explain this sentence in a context other than Moulanas.\n\n3. We all are in need of this courage and strength. May Allah Ta?ala assist us all against our two enemies, Shaytaan and Nafs.\n\n4. Kindly inform us about your whereabouts so that we may advise accordingly.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
