  "question": "Regarding correct nikah ceremony, holding hands for nikah.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome years ago, my brother got married. The maulana performing the nikah (from Indian bankground & a relatively well-known islamic figure in USA) came up with something completely different. He made my brother and his bride sit together and made them hold hands and then performed the nikah. I was young at that time therefore, I was unaware if this was a correct way of performing nikah. Now that I am older, I am wondering if such a nikah is even considered valid or not because I thought that before the nikah is finalized, the girl and boy should be in separate rooms. Kindly advise me if this the correct of way of performing a nikah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBefore the Nikah, the boy and girl are strangers to one another. It is\nprohibited for both to touch one another.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
