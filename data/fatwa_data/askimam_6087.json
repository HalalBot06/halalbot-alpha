  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhile going through the questions on your site you said \"You have not heard of the dua ganzul arsh\". I have this dua in my panj surah and there it is also mentioned that this dua was given to Rasool Maqbool SAW, by Jibreel AS, and Jibreel AS said that this is written near the throne of Allah and the dua virtues were mentioned. So, how come you don't know about it. You even said that it is a dua by some pious person.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe have not come across any reference regarding Du'aa Ganjul Arsh being\ngiven to Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and that it is written\nnear the Arsh of Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
