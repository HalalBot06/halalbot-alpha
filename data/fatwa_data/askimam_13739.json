  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a bit of a problem which is off such that I am very determined to sort out if I can.\n\nI went to a secondary school to which I attended to for 5 years. During my time there I was a member of a group. I was with this same group/class for 5 years. Because they respected me and my religion, by Allah’s mercy I felt that it was an obligation upon me to call these people towards the oneness of Allah through: a) my actions which I kind of feel that I did not take advantage of and b) by talking to my friend about the minor signs of the last day which Allah had bestowed quite a lot knowledge about onto me. If there were any people in the room at that time listening to me then lets hope they had benefitted.\n\nI now attend to University. The thing now is that I know which of those people in my group/class from the secondary school go to the same university as me. I do not know which course they are doing or at which campus they are in. However there is a way of me communicating with them and that is through e-mail.\n\nI have spoken to two alims. One has suggested that I e-mail them (both males and females) and I introduce myself, say how I have been. He advised to ask about them and how they have been. He then advised that I should then give the website that I intend to give to them or show them which is www.islam-guide.com.  \n\n \n\nThe other alim has suggested the same with reagards to introducing  but he feels that I should give a book rather than the website that I have shown above. The book he has advised me to give is Towards Understanding Islam by Sayyid Abul A'la Mawdudi. Both have warned me about going too far when I contact the females and have reminded me about staying within the limits. I personally feel inclined towards the first Alim's view.\n\n \n\nIf you have a different plan or any advice then that would be greatly appreciated.\n\nMay peace be upon you, the mercy of Allah and his blessings.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe suggest that you introduce yourself via email and you consult a local Aalim for some good literature that could be sent to them.\n\nWe also advise that you contact females via email only and stay within the limits. You should also make du’aa for their guidance. May Allah assist and protect you in your good endervours, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
