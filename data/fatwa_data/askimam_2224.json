  "question": "Is polygamy in Islam considered Sunnah? Is it recommended or just lawful?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAnd what are the conditions of it? Can a man just marry a second wife for no reason as long as he has the means of support for both of them? What is the opinion of polygamy of the four madhab (Shafi'i, Hanafi, Maliki and Hanbal)? Am I a bad Muslim woman if I don't want to be involed in a polygamous marriage? Or would I be considered a weak Muslim? Also, is it possible for a woman to make a marriage contract before getting married to the man about him agreeing not to take a second wife and if he does take another wife, can she divorce him? Again, I would like to know the opinion of all four madhab on this subject. I would appreciate any details you can give me. Jazak Allah khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer our reply to a similar query - below\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nAccording to Shari'a, a Muslim male may have four wives simultaneously with\nthe condition of maintaining equality among all his wives. Therefore, in\nprinciple, you can remarry without divorcing your wife.\n\nHowever, in order to avoid bitter feelings to your present wife, you should\nfirst discuss your intentions of remarrying with wisdom. That will save you\nfrom the negative consequences fo betrayal, etc. being possibly expressed by\nher upon her discovering your secret remarriage."
