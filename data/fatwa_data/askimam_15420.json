  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI wanna ask a question if a palestine girl wants too marry a pakistan guy and they know each other really good is it ok 2 marry a pakistan if she palestine ? \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf both the boy and the girl are Muslims who subscribe to the beliefs of the Ahlus Sunnah Wal jammah and in the case of the girl, if the boy is her kufu, then she can marry him. If the boy is not her kufu, she can only marry him if her family (father) agrees. If she marries such a boy without the consent of her father, then the father will have a right to object to the nikah.\n\nKufu literally means to be equal. In the context of marriage, it refers to equality between the spouses in terms of status in society etc. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
