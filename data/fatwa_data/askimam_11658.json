  "question": "Plz give exact detail of ‘syrian’ style torpee of Rasoollullah SAWas in hadith. Did Rasoolullah SAW shave head for Umra (not Haj)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We were unable to find any specific description of the style and design of the Syrian Topee of Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam]. However, regarding the ?Syrian? robe of Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam], the Ulama have mentioned that ?Syrian? here refers to the fact that it was tailored in Syria. (Muntahas-sool vol.1 pg.461). Perhaps the same reason will apply in the case of the topee.\n\n2. Yes, Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] did shave his head on the occasion of Umrah as well. The Sahaabi [radhialaahu anhu] who shaved the blessed head of Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] was Sayyiduna Abu Hind.
