  "question": "Is it halal or haram to borrow money from the bank on interest in order to purchase a house or a property ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo take a loan on interest is strictly prohibited in Shari'ah.\n\nThe negative consequences of such a loan could be worse than the present grief and agony. As an alternative, we advise that instead of paying monthly instalments for the loan from the bank, you hire a house and pay a monthly rental.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
