  "question": "Is it permissible to not demand repayment of a loan to oneâ€™s real brother and instead treat it as payment towards obligatory zakaat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nTo pay back the loan. His financial position is very weak and he is jobless and under debt from other people also. It seems that he will not be able to repay the loan. Considering his financial position and his present circumstances I think he will qualify as a zakaat recipient. My I gave some money as a loan to my real brother 12 years ago .Due to various reasons he has not been able questions are as follows 1.Is it permissible to give zakaat to one?s real brother? 2.If the answer is yes, then considering the above specific situation, would it be permissible for me to not demand the repayment of the loan and instead consider it a payment towards my zakaat obligations for this year up to the extent of the amount due. 3.If the answer to question 2 is yes, then do I have to get the consent of my brother regarding discharging my zakaat obligation? I fear that his feelings may be hurt and he may not like being considered a zakaat recipient. In that case would it be OK for me to just tell him I am not demanding repayment of the loan and without telling him can I adjust the amount towards my zakaat obligations?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Sister-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\n1. It is permissible. (Shaami vol.2 pg.346; HM Saeed)\n2. Tamleek (transfer of ownership) is necessary for the Zakaat to be\ndischarged. Therefore, the sum should be handed over to him first, then you\ncan request him to pay off his debt. He does not have to be told that he is\nbeing given Zakaat money.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
