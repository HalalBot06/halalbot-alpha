  "question": "I have intentions of taking admission in amadrassah after sometime in order to become an Alim. 3) What is the position of 'urs' in shariah which is celebrated on mazars?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have intentions of taking admission in a madrassah after sometime in order to become an Alim. I also intend to go out in the path of Allah for Jihad and Tabligh. I want to work for Islam purely for Allah's raza towards me. I also get a feeling that after my commitment towards deen, my family will benefit from me. However, I also imagine that after becoming an Alim, I will be giving speeches and writing books like Moulana xyz or Shaikh xyz. I also very lightly feel that thousands of people will be listening to me. Moreover, I imagine that when I will go out in the path of Allah, my relatives will think about me. In short, I want to correct my intentions to be solely for Allah, but sometimes the aforementioned thoughts come to my mind and I get frightened that my niyyah is fame and that I shouldnt go forward to serve Islam at all. Kindly tell me any way to correct my niyyah. Please inform whether comparing with a famous Alim is also an error of niyyah? 2) What significance do Mazaars hold in Shariah? Mazar of sheikh Abdullah Shah Ghazi r.a or Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani r.a. etc. 3) What is the position of 'urs' in shariah which is celebrated on mazars?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. May Allah Ta?ala fulfil all your intention. In a Hadith, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has mentioned, ?Whosoever Allah Ta?ala wishes good for, Allah Ta?ala grants him the understanding of Deen.? (Mishkaat pg.32). Hence, you should make an all out effort to fulfil your intentions of becoming an Aalim of Deen. Do not let any of those thoughts deter you. Ultimately, all our actions should be done solely for the pleasure of Allah and with no other motive behind it. Allah Ta?ala may use a person for his Deen in numerous different ways, e.g. lecturing, teaching, writing, etc. but this should not be our objective.%0D%0A%0D%0APossibly, the most effective way of attaining sincerity is by liaising with a reliable Shaykh or Aalim of Deen and by sitting in his company. Thereafter, you may explain your condition to him in detail after which he may be able to give you a prescription for reformation. Also, by constantly being involved in the effort of Da?awah and Tabligh will have a great impact on the heart of a person.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The burial places or graves of our pious predecessors are indeed honourable and dignified places. However, building over them huge structures and buildings has no basis in Shari?ah. One may visit the graves of these pious people only for the sake of making Du?aa, etc. for these friends of Allah. However, one is not allowed to pray to these graves or to ask for anything from the inmates of these graves directly. Only Allah Ta?ala gives and provides.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. It is not permissible.
