  "question": "when u reading Quran and 'sajdah\" comes by u can perform that sajdah after u have finished reading, u need not perform it at the very same moment",
  "answer": "QUESTION\ni had an argument with my dad the other day.. he says that when u reading Quran and 'sajdah\" comes by u can perform that sajdah after u have finished reading, u need not perform it at the very same moment, but i believe that we should perform as soon as we read that Ayat, because if sajdah is mentioned there it definitely means something and one should perform sajdah as soon he read that particular Ayat.Â  Which is the right way? My next question is, recently i was in India, and i was living at my uncle's place, there in their society they 3-4 Mosques in one society, one being Hanafi Madhab Mosque and the other Sha'afi Madhab Mosque, what i want to know is.. in Ramadan if the Imam of Hanafi Madhab gives the Adhan first, am i (belong to sha'fi Madhab) allowed to break my fast? or shall i wait till Imam of Sha'afi Madhab gives the Adhan? Jazakallah..\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Your dad is right. It is not necessary to do sajda tilawat immediately. It is advisable to do so.\n\n2. You may break your fast after the first Adhaan immediately upon sunset.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
