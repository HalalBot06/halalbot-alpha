  "question": "We usually have Qiyam-ul-Lail at our Masjid, where lot of young men participate. Part of the activities is getting up for Tahajjud and praying in Jamaat. Does the Shariat prohibit this in any way?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the majority of the ulema, the Ahadith that mentions\n'Qiyaamul-lail' refers to the 'Taraweeh Salaat'. Hence, most of the ulema\nare of the opinion that, after having performed one's taraweeh salaat, one\nmay perform any other nafl salaat, if one wishes to. However, these salah\nshould be performed individually, rather than in jamaat. [FIQHI-MAQAALAAT :\n2]\n\nHowever, some scholars permit the performing of Tahajjud Salaat in Jamaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
