  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAsalaamu Alaikum\n\nPlease advise if the below is correct,\n\nJazakAllah\n\n\n[QUESTION] Please confirm if it is permissible to have  Meelad un Nabie (SAW).\n\n[ANSWER]\nIT IS IMPERMISSIBLE TO HAVE MEELAD UN NABIE.\n\nRespected BROTHER, this is an important question and we hope to answer clearly and to the best of our ability. Unfortunately there is no shortcut to the truth, so please bear with us.\n\nFirstly, the first MOULOOD took place 400 years after the death of Nabi Muhammad (buh). THe Fatimide Shi'ites felt that they should also have a holiday like Christmas since Muhammad pbuh is greater than Jesus. And since Jesus had Christmas for him, then we should follow the evil despicable ways of the Christians and celebrate Muhammad's birthday. Due to this Ummah's resistance to innovations, Meelad proponents fabricate the sayings of the 4 Khaliphs about Meelad.  NONE of these 4 Khaliphs celebrated Meelad, yet they had tons of wealth to do so. We don't know where these so-called sayings of the Khaliphs came from, but it is UNANIMOUS that they NEVER celebrated the Prophet's birthday. They NEVER performed MEELAD.\n\nA BID'A linguistically is something innovated, something new. In as far as the ShareeAh meaning is concerned, it is something new pertaining to the religion for which there is no evidence from the Shari`ah (Quran, Sunnah, the Companions, etc). There is no evidence in Al-QurAn, Sunnah, Sahabah, and the 2 generations after them with regards to Moulood. Therefore it is an innovated act. So too, there are many innovated practices in the Ummah such as TABLEEGH JAMAAH's Gush and 40 days, and the Hindu and Jewish Pagan holiday celebration called Ijtimaah, where only recently 2 million gathered in Bangladesh. Imagine sending these 2 million people against the enemy of ALLAH to put an end to oppression. But No! Rather, they turned their backs on the suffering and went to a convenient location to make BidAhs and duas. They are guilty of turning their backs on their suffering neighbors in Afghanistan, Kashmir and Gujarat to go for innovative (bidah) holidays around the world which they call 4 months, forty-days and Ijtimah. Their outward appearances won't avail them come question time!\n\nThey say that they are ONLY doing ISLAH (self purification). ALLAH says about such people who ONLY do self purification whilst ignoring injustice and opression: Surah Baqara 2:11-12 > (11. And when it is said to them:\n\"Do not make mischief on the earth,\" they say: \"We are only MusliHoon (self reformers and peace makers).\") (12. Verily, they are the ones who make mischief (MUFSIDOON), but they perceive not.)\" These are just a few examples of Bid'Ahs.\n\nHowever, the best evidence to teach us that we shouldn't be following our desires in worshiping according to our whims and fancies is the Ayahs 19 and 20 in Surah At-Tawbah, Surah 9:19-20 \"(19. Do you consider the providing of drinking water to the pilgrims and the maintenance of Al-Masjid Al-Haram as equal to the worth of those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah - They are not equal before Allah. And Allah guides not those people who are the\nwrongdoers.) (20. Those who believed and emigrated and strove hard and fought in Allah's cause with their wealth and their lives, are far higher in degree with Allah. They are the successful.)\" Here 3 men were debating as to how they want to worship ALLAH. One said that after imaan he wanted to maintain the Masjid Al-Haraam (the sacred masjid). This meant that he will be constantly looking after the Wudhu and the toilet facilities for the Pilgrims and that he will be there all the time for all the Salah and all the Zikr and all the DUROOS (lessons) with the pious learned people.\nThe 2nd man said that after IMAN he ONLY wanted to provide water for the Hujjaj (pilgrims). The 3rd said that after Iman he wanted to be in the battlefields. Umar (ra) heared them and scolded them for making a noise close to the Prophet's Minbar before the JumAh Salah, and told them that he will ask the Prophet about what they differed over after the JumAh Salah. Hence ALLAH revealed the verses 19 and 20 of Surah At-TAwbah.\nWe must realise that what the first two men intended would be perceived as quite noble and virtuous. But according to the ShareeAh of ALLAh and HIS Messenger, this was a wrongful wish and in the end of AYAH 19, ALLAH refers to people who follow their own desires and ignorance in worshiping ALLAH as \"QOWMU AZ-ZAALIMEEN\" (PEOPLE OF WRONGDOERS and Oppressors).\n\nIn ISLAM, when it comes to worldly matters, then everything other than what has been clarified as HARAAM by ALLAH and HIS Prophet [pbuh] is HALAAL. On the contrary, when it comes to religious matters, ONLY what has been prescribed should be practiced, whilst everything else is a BidAh and an evil practice. This is the rule, or else every Tom, Dick and Harry will bring into the DEEN whatever he feels like. When we carry out acts of Ibaadah which haven't been prescribed by the ShareeAh, then we are worshiping our desires as it is our desires that make us choose other than the prescribed Ibaadah. And we practice an Ibaadah that our forefathers have been engaged in out of ignorance or otherwise, then we are on the religion of our forefathers, and in this way we are worshiping them who were worshiping their vain desires.\n\nAll these BID'AH Ibaadahs are adopted by lazy Muslims who are duped into believing that these Ibaadah are short-cuts and quick tickets to Jannah.\nEg. I can easily give you a card on your birthday to show care. But when you are being robbed and killed in the street then I turn my back. Moulood and IjtimaaAH is a manifestation of love through a weak, coward and convenient manner. We will stand up and sing praises and peace to the Prophet and this will make up for us not following his Sunnah and not protecting his precious Ummah. It's like I say to my uncle how much I love him, buy him cards on Father's day and his birthday, take for a meal, invite him for a braai, etc. But when his son is being robbed in the market I turn my back, deluding myself that the former show of love is sufficient.\n\nIjtimaaAh, Moulood and Salaami wasn't practiced by the Sahaabah (RA) and neither was it after them. We find today people propagating this kind of \"love\" for the Prophet (pbuh) which is a weak and convenient type of love much to the delight of Islam's enemies. Propagators of Meelad and other BidAhs fail to teach us how to really love Muhammad (saw) by citing the myriad examples of Sahabah who risked their lives out of affection, eg.\nNusayba bint Al-Ka'Ab Al-Khazrajiyah and Abu Dujana Al-Samak during the Battle of Uhud. Abu Dujana looked like a porcupine with arrows and spears protruding from his body after shielding the Prophet (saw) from the KAAFIR onslaughts. What about Umm Sulaym who carried a dagger and when asked by our Prophet (saw) as to why she was carrying this weapon? She replied \"so that I could cut out the stomach of any person who attacks you\". This is true love. This kind of bravery was a general tenet of the Sahaabah, yet we don't learn about this form of love, which is far nobler than lip service. Which love and care would you prefer? Lip service on your birthday or action every single day of your life.\n\nALLAH swt says: \"This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.\" Surah 5: Maida Verse 3. At this juncture there was no MEELAD, TABLEEGH JAMAAH, IJTIMAAHA nor was there any of this stuff until many years later when Indian Muslims who didn't want to give up their evil idol-worshiping ways of their mushrikeen Hindu, Shiah and Bhuddist and Tamil forefathers brought this contamination into Islam.\n\nThe followers of the religions before us had differences of opinions and split into false sects, each group claiming to be following the truth.\nThis Ummah too has split into sects, all of which are misguided and end up in the HELLFIRE apart from one, which is Ahlus-Sunnah Wal-Jama`ah, those who adhere to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah and what was followed by the first generations, the Companions, their followers, and the Imams of the Muslims of earlier and later times. In his Mustadrak, Al-Hakim recorded that the Messenger of Allah was asked which of the sects was the saved sect and he said: \"(Those who are on what I and my Companions are upon.)\", in otherwords those who are following the methodology of the religion in accordance to the Prophet's (pbuh) Sunnah and in accordance to the CONSENSUS of his Noble Companions (Al-JamaaAh).\nHence the term Ahlus Sunnah Wa-AljaamAh or the people following the Prophet [pbuh] and his Companions [may ALLAH be pleased with them all].\n\nTHE PROPHET pbuh asked the Sahaabaha: \"Do you all know what is Al-Kawthar?\" They said, `Allah and His Messenger know best.' He said, [Verily, it is a river that my Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, has promised me and it has abundant goodness. It is a pond where my Ummah will be brought to on the Day of Judgement. Its containers are as numerous as the stars in the sky. Then a servant of Allah from among them will be (prevented from it) and I will say: \"O Lord! Verily, he is from my Ummah (followers).\" Then He (Allah) will say: \"Verily, you do not know what he introduced (or innovated) after you.)\" This is the wording of Imam Muslim.\nImam Ahmad recorded this Hadith from Muhammad bin Fudayl, who reported from Al-Mukhtar bin Fulful, who reported it from Anas bin Malik.\n\n(The most truthful speech is Allah's Speech, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad. The worst matters are the newly invented (in religion), every newly invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is a heresy, and every heresy is in the Fire.)\n\n(So as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation (from the truth) they follow that which is not entirely clear thereof, seeking Al-Fitnah (polytheism, innovations and trials), and seeking for its hidden meanings)(Aale-Imraan 3:7).\n\nVerily, no innovator in the religion could ever rely on any authentic evidence in the Qur'an that testifies to his innovation. The Qur'an came to distinguish between truth and falsehood, and guidance and misguidance.\nThe Qur'an does not contain any discrepancies or contradictions, because it is a revelation from the Most Wise, Worthy of all praise.\n\nMeaning of Badi`\n (He is the Badi` of the heavens and the earth) Meaning He originated, created, invented and brought them into existence without precedence, as Mujahid and As-Suddi said. This is why the word for innovation - Bid`ah - comes from it, because it is something that did not have a precedence.\n\nAllah condemns those who deny the Resurrection and who deny that Allah is able to restore life to the dead, those who turn away from that which Allah has revealed to His Prophets and, in their views -- denial and disbelief -- follow every rebellious Shaytan among men and Jinn. This is the state of the followers of innovation and misguidance, who turn away from the truth and follow falsehood, following the words of the leaders of misguidance who call people to follow innovation and their own desires and opinions.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh.\n\nAt the outset, celebrating birthdays as is the custom and the norm of the Kufaar is not permissible in Shariah. The prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) has stated in the Hadeeth:\n\nقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم من تشبه بقوم فهو منهم (سنن ابي داود, ج2 ص203, سعيد)\n\nIn principle, to host gatherings in which mention is made of the blessed birth of Rasulullah (صلي الله عليه وسلم), his noble qualities, his pure lifestyle (Seerah), his sublime character and various other aspects of his life, and to attend such gatherings is not void of reward and blessings, as long as it is in conformity to the Sunnah.\n\nThe following points should also be kept in mind:\n\n1) It should not be that people regard it as a must to have such programs.\n2) Gatherings of this nature should not be restricted to a specific month or day.\n3) It should be hosted with the sole intention of educating the masses regarding the Sunnah.\n\n However, some groups of people, due to their extreme love for the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) have introduced many other practises into such gatherings which go against the basic principles of Shariah. A person should abstain from such gatherings.\n\nAs far as Tabligh is concerned, due to fact that this effort is so simple, yet so effective, many people who could not achieve what the Tabligh Jamaats had achieved in a short span of time, resorted to criticise this noble work. The basic and core principles of the Tabligh Jamaat is based on Qurān and Sunnah. In essence, it is no new effort, but the revival of the effort of Nabuwwah.  \n\nGoing out to different locations for 3 days, 40 days, 4 months etc is not a holiday. Had it been a holiday, it would have not been proven to be so effective, reforming the lives of hundreds and thousands of people around the world.\n\nThere are many things which are prominent in our lives which were not found in the era of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) or the 2 generations after that, e.g. the establishment of Madrasahs and universities, the syllabus taught in these institutions etc and nobody regards it to be part of Deen. It is simply a means and the stepping stone to accomplish our objectives i.e. to have a better understanding of Deen.\n\nIn a similar manner, to go with the Tabligh Jamaat for 3 days, 40 days, 4 months etc is not regarded to be as an integral part of Deen, but it is proven to be very effective method of propagating Islam amongst the masses and reviving the Sunnah in the lives of the Muslims.\n\nWe make Dua and ask Allah to grant us the correct understanding of Deen and equip us with the expertise of differentiating between what is right from what is not, Aameen.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
