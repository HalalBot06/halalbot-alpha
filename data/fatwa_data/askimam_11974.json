  "question": "girl involved in zina, how can i help her? she is staying with the man",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nthey are not married she doesnt listen to anybody\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for writing to the institute regarding your friend's devious behavior.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou say that your friend will not listen to anybody. I guess you have spoken to her at length about the risks she faces. These dangers are manyfold and not only to her imaan. She also risks being abused in every possible way, of being infected with venereal diseases and of being cast out as a 'has been' when the guy is done with her. Have you pointed out to her that she is Allah Ta'ala's creation and that she has been granted the gift of imaan? This means that she is expected to live by the rules of the Quran which is the language of Allah Ta'ala. In teh Quran He gives us clear guidelines and commands as to how He expects all Muslims to live their lives.%0D%0A%0D%0AAre her parents aware of her situation? If they are not, it is best to inform them through a learned elder in the community. Ask other learned folk who may have some influence over her to talk to her at length. If possible, take literature to her so that she can read it at her convenience. Give her a \"Fazaail A'maal' an ask her to read it, insha'allah she will find some guidance in there and give up her way of life.Try to express to her that she is so special not only to her friends and her family but also to her Creator. It is important to emphasise the positives in her so that she does not only get negative vibes from you.You may risk her breaking off ties with you completely. This is going to be a very difficult task but Allah Ta'ala will reward you for making the effort for as long as you can. You have to be very careful that you are not influenced by her way of life. At some stage if she remains adamant and stubborn, you will have to evaluate your situation and do not put your imaan at risk as you can get caught up with the fitna too. %0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala reward you for inviting to good and forbidding from evil, ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A1SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
