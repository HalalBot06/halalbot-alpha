  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam alaikum. Is it in Islam that a woman should follow her husband to wherever he wants to go to find the best living or the best interest for himself and his family even if the woman has to give up the best of her interest(s) , like favorite school to seek education, environment, etc)?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah states, \"Men are administrators over (affairs of) women by the virtue%0D%0Agranted to some over others by Allah, and by the wealth they spend. (in%0D%0Acaring for their women). The upright women, then, are those who are obedient%0D%0A(to their husbands- according to Ibne Abbaas R.A - Tafseer Ibne Katheer Vol.%0D%0A1 Pg. 653 Darus Salaam), guarding in absence (their chastity and their%0D%0Ahusbands'property) (Nisaa' : 34) Nabi (S.A.W) mentioned in a Hadith, \"The%0D%0Abest among wives is she, when your gaze touches her, she pleases you, when%0D%0Ayou instruct her, she is obedient and in your absence, she guards her%0D%0Achastity and your wealth. (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is clear from the above, that just as it is the duty of the husband to%0D%0Aprovide full care, support and shelter to his family (according to his%0D%0Ameans), it is only fair of the wife to assist him by her obedience, provided%0D%0Asuch does not entail Divine disobedience.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Bilaal Cassim%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
