  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWe really appreciate the work done by Darul Iftaa.\n\nWe InshAllah intend to name our son Ishaq when he is born.\n\nQuestion 1: What is your opinion/the islamic opinion of this name??\n\nWe are a little confused about the spelling of this name in Latin alphabet.\n\nAs you know in Islamic countries this name is spelled Ishaq.\n\nIn UK it is spelled Isaac.\nIn our country it is spelled Isak.\n\nWe wish to spell this name as following Isak because we are living in Denmark.\n\nQuestion 2: But what are your/islamic opinion on the preferred spelling of this name?\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n1.      Ishāq was the name of a Prophet.\n\n2.      He was the son of Hadhrat Ibrahim (Allaihi Salaam). He was a glad tiding to his father from the side of Allah Ta’ala, due to him being born after a very long time.\n\n3.      We should inculcate and practise the correct Islamic values in every aspect of our life, even when keeping the names of our children.\nThe correct pronunciation and spelling of the name Ishāq is as follows:\nاسحاق - Ishāq\nTransliteration is as Ishāq.\n\nIshāq means: Glad tidings\n\n\nWe make Dua to Allah Ta’ala that he grants you a healthy son, and makes your son an Aalim who would be a means of spreading heedayat (guidance) to the four corners of the world.
