  "question": "Is it permissible to eat some Halaal food (Like Cheese Burger or French Fries) from a Restaurant which sold Haraam diets also like Hamburger,wine etc",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, it must be noted that the Shariah has emphasized exercising%0D%0Aprecaution consuming halaal and abstaining from haraam. Therefore, the%0D%0ANoble Quran advises to eat that which is Tayyib (halaal beyond doubt).%0D%0AFurthermore, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) advised us to abstain%0D%0Afrom places where one can be accused of engaging in haraam.%0D%0A%0D%0ABasically there are two points to consider before eating at any place.%0D%0A%0D%0Aa) The food outlet must be owned (not managed) by a good and upright Muslim.%0D%0AWhen in doubt, abstain - that is best for your taqwa.%0D%0A%0D%0Ab) The fact that a non-Muslim owned outlet selling only fish, for example,%0D%0Aalso cannot be \"trusted\" simply because the law of halaal applies beyond the%0D%0Afrontage of the outlet. The area of concern is the kitchen. In one case, a%0D%0Astrictly fish outlet - served nothing but only fish - looked absolutely fine%0D%0Auntil a Muslim employee expressed concern that the owner and family%0D%0Aregularly prepare their meals at the same kitchen serving pork, beacon, etc.%0D%0Aprepared in the same fryer, utensil, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore it is a misconception by some that we may eat if \"alcohol is not%0D%0Aserved\" or \"not served to us\".%0D%0A%0D%0AWas salaam%0D%0A%0D%0AAhmad Kathrada%0D%0AADMINISTRATOR%0D%0A"
