  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy wife completed 40 days of Nifaas yesterday. She took a bath, however she still had a little bleeding. A fatwa on Sharia board tells that this is not considered as the monthly bleeding and hence is not be considered as napak (dirty). Therefore she can pray namaz however if the bleeding continues for another 15 days then she will be considered as napak. My question is that we had a mubasharat (Intercourse) yesterday night. Is this ok or a sin?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe ruling of the ShariahBoard is correct. The bleeding for the 15 days after the nifaas will be considered as Tuhr (period of being pure). It is permissible to be intimate with one's wife during that time.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
