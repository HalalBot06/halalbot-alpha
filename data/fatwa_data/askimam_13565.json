  "answer": "QUESTION\nAOA Dear Imam Thanks for the answer, I told my friend to visit this site regarding the answer from imam sahib, I read the answer and one question came in my mind you have wrote \"kafir shia\" when they read a kalam \"LA ILLA HA ILL LAHA MUHAMMAD DAR RASOOL ULLAH\" mostly ullmah said that who read the kalama as stated above he is muslim and nobody can say him kafir, but you qouat clearly kafir, kindly explain why we can say a person who read the kalama awaiting your reply secondly please told weather the khulfa-e-rashidin choosen by God or through democracy if choosen by God then explain through Quran-e-karim and if choosen by democracy then they will not islamic ruler and if some body not agreed with them then how this will effect on their iman kindly explain also in the light of islam thanks\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe Kalima is not the only requirement of Imaan.\n\nYou state \"somebody not agree with them\". Agreement with them is not the real issue, the real issue is whether the Sahaabah (Radhiyallahu unhum ajma’een) were Muslims or not. The shiahs say no, and we Muslims regard all the Sahaabah (Radhiyallahu unhum ajma’een) as Muslims.\n\nAnd Allah knows best.\n\nWas Salaam\n\nE. Vawda\nfor Daarul Iftaa"
