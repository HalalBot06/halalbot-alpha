The butter must be taken away from the fire. You are in an environment of intermingling of sexes. Your parents have sent you there. They cannot expect you not to be melted (attracted) by the fire of boys (heat). That is exactly what is happening to you now. Your parents should live up to reality and decide to either get you out from the university or get you married.\n\nYou should discuss your predicament with your parents and tell them you wish to stay away from sin. If they still refuse, then you should do whatever is possible to abstain from sin even if it means for you to leave the university.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
