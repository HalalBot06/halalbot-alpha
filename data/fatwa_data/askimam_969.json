  "question": "Many toothpastes contain extracts of miswak. Is the reward of miswak gained by their use?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Sunnah is to use the actual Miswaak stick itself. Using extracts of\nMiswaak in toothpaste does not substitute the Sunnah use of the Miswaak\nstick. It is also not prohibited to use the extracts of Miswaak in\ntoothpastes.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
