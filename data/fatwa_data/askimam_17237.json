  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to find out the significance of 12PM at nightI would like to find out by 12pm at night, according to a lot of Indian custom most old people say that we should not go for a shower at 12 in the night or go outside etc, and especially for women it is worse and regarded as a bad time, aslo some say that our esha should be read before 12pm at night, i find this custom very hard to believe as in most nerations it seems that the night is regarded more with barakah than the day more ebadah should be done at night, please could you inform me if their is any signifance in the 12pm custom also could you please tell me what are the bad times according to islam for us to be outside and taking a bath, and for women and children Shukran\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThere is no basis in Islam regarding the 12:00 pm custom. It is permissible for one, male or female to carry out ones work and fulfill ones needs during anytime at night.  \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
