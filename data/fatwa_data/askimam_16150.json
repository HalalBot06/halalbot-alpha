  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissible to eat at a close relavtives house which is on a mortgage?\n\nIs it permissble to go to muslim weddings which you dont know where the meat came from?\n\nIs it permissable to pray salah when you havn't seen the discharge but have felt it?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1.      Yes, it is permissible provided the food itself is Halaal.\n\n2.      If you are certain that the meat came from Haraam sources, it is not permissible to partake of the meals. If you have genuine doubts, it is best to abstain. However, mere suspicion and unfounded doubts should be avoided. In all probability, a Muslim would feed Halaal food.\n\n3.      If you feel the discharge but don’t see anything on your underwear etc, and this occurs frequently, ignore it as this may be Shaytaani waswasah. Yes, if you are certain of a discharge, your wudhu is invalidated.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nDarul Iftaa"
