  "question": "If a woman's health is affected by pregnancy, can she get irreversible contraception?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy wife has a disability with her eyes called \"RP\". We have two healthy kids and the doctor has advised that due to her condition if she does fall pregnant again there is a chance that she may loose her eye sight. Is it possible for her to get permanent contraception?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nIf the doctor you consulted is a competent and pious Muslim, and he has ruled out reversible contraception as a viable option in your wife's case, then your wife may act on his recommendation and get irreversible contraception. Otherwise, you should consult a competent and pious Muslim doctor and inquire about reversible contraception first. If he does not see any benefit in that, then you may get irreversible contraception.[i]\n\n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMl.
