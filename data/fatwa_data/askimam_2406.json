  "question": "Should I return the interest from my tax return to IRS (Internal Revenue Service)? Should I give this money (interest) to some needy people?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI need an advise in reference to interest income which earned by my tax retrun for the year 1998. I'm a resident of Dallas TX in USA and for some reason I didn't get my tax return for the year 1998 in 1999. Last week I received a check from Internal Revenue Service for my 1998 tax return with interest included. Anyway, since I received my money and interest ($284.32)is included which I don't want. My concern is what do I do with this interest income now. Should I return the interest to IRS? or Should I give this money (interest) to some needy people? Please advise me in this regard. May Allah give us reward. Aameen. Jazak Allah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nInterest monies must be given to the poor and needy who are eligible to\naccept Zakaat without the intention of reward. However, interest received\nfrom government institutes, eg. post office could be used to offset\ngovernment taxes. Interest received from private banks cannot be used to\noffset taxes. It may be used to offset interest charged from the same bank.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
