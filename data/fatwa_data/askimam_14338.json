  "answer": "QUESTION\n\na person has missed 0 years of salaah, andnow he wants to make up for all his salah..is it obligatory on him to fulfill these or what does he do?\n\nfor some reason someone else is saying that if that person repents then he doesnt have to make up for them which i dont understand. hanafi maslak plz\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe matter of Qadhaa is discussed in the Hadith. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has mentioned, Whoever forgets a prayer, then he must perform it when he remembers.â€™ (Bukhari)\n\nFrom this Hadith, we deduce that it is necessary to make up for missed Salaats. This making up of missed Salaat is the repentance for the sin of missing Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
