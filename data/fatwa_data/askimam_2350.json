  "question": "after the stunning of an animal (here,a steel cone perforate the cranium),a little hole is done and blood is bleeding:is the animal halal at this step before the slaughtering?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThere is doubt to know if the animal is still alive or not because some of them are not moving anymore after stunning and some are moving but suffered (before the slaughtering).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ: Is it permissible to stun an animal before slaughtering?\nQ: Due to many negative factors, for example, blood clotting, stunning\nwithout any reason is Makrooh (reprehensible). (Shaami vol.6 pg.296; HM\nSaeed)\nIf the animal is wild and uncontrollable, then only will one be excused for\nstunning the animal. The sacrifice will be valid only if the animal was\nalive at the time of slaughtering after the stunning.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
