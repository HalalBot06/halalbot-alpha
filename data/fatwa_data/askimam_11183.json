  "question": "1) When the first qibla (Bayt-al-Muqqadas) was changed to Makkah (Holy Kaabah), what was the Prophet of Islam (SAW) doing at that particular instant",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have two questions: 1) When the first qibla (Bayt-al-Muqqadas) was changed to Makkah (Holy Kaabah), what was the Prophet of Islam (SAW) doing at that particular instant. I heard that he (SAW) was in namaz during that moment when the Angel Gibraeel informed him about this. Is it true. 2) If he was in prayer (namaz), then did he change the direction while praying (i.e. during the namaz) itself. If so, then what about the people praying behind him.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSome Ulama are of the opinion that the order to change the Qiblah was given before Asr salah, thereafter Nabi (Saw) and the Sahabah (R.A) performed salah to the new Qiblah in Masjidun Nabawi. This is based on a narration in Sahih Bukhari which mentions that the first salah performed by Nabi (Saw) to the ka'bah was Asr salah, which was performed in Masjidun Nabawi. This is the opinion of Allamah Suyuti and Allamah Aalusi. According to them, the Masjid that is famous today as Masjidul Qiblatain , has in fact no real virtue as its supposed significance is based on the fact that Nabi (Saw) turned around to the new Qiblah while performing salah in this masjid. ( See Ruhul Ma'ani Vol.2 Pg.10, Faidul Bari and Darsul Bukhari of Allamah Uthmani)%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, the majority of Ulama say that Nabi (saw) really changed Qibla while in salah. The entire incident is as follows: When Hazrat Bishr ibn Baraa ibn Ma'roor (R.A) passed away, Nabi (Saw) visited his mother who was residing in the area of Banu Salimah. She prepared lunch for Nabi (SAW), thereafter the time of Zuhr salah entered so Nabi (Saw) led the Zuhr salah in the Masjid of Banu Salimah. After completing two rakaat of Salah, whilst in the third rakat, Nabi (Saw) was ordered to now face towards the Ka'bah. which was in the opposite direction to Baitul Maqdis. While in salah Nabi (Saw) turned around and went to the other side (back) of the musjid. The men also turned and stood where the women had been standing, while the women now took what had been the place of the men. In this way, everyone turned to face the Ka'bah. This masjid then became known as Masjidul Qiblatain. This is the opinion of Hafiz ibn Hajr, Allamah Binnori, Hafiz Mughlataa'ee, Hafiz Ainee, Allamah Samhoodi, Allamah Halabi etc. It is also backed up by many ahadith and is attested to by many historical narrations as well as the practice of the people of Madina of according significance to Masjidul Qiblatain. They resolve the apparent contradiction between these narrations and the one in Bukhari, by saying that while the qibla was changed in Zuhr salah in Masjidul Qiblatain, the first complete salah performed towards the Ka'bah was Asr salah in the masjid of Nabi (Saw).(See Fathul Bari Baab no. 30, Ma'arifus Sunan Vol.3 Pg.371, Wafaa ul Wafaa Vol.1 Pg.361,363,841, Sharhul Aini ala Abi Dawud Vol.4 Pg.355, Sharhu Ibn Majah Pg.1669, Saheeh ibn Khuzaimah Vol.2 Pg.224,Ibn Sa'd Vol.1 Pg.187,As-Seerah Al-Halabiyyah Vol.2 Pg.355 ,Al-Muqtafaa Vol.1 Pg.79, At-Tamheed Vol.6 Pg.484, Ibn Kathir Vol.1 Pg.199,Durrul Manthoor Vol.1 Pg.348 etc)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
