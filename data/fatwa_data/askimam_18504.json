  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nIn which hand should we wear our watch?  Is it permissible to wear it in our left hand?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIt is permissible to wear the watch on either hand on the condition that:\n\nWearing a watch on that particular hand is not the salient feature (shiʿār) of the disbelievers\nIt does not resemble the opposite gender\n\n \n\nHowever, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم  liked to do all good things with his right hand.  Wearing a watch is a good act such that it helps a person keep track of time for punctuality and prayer times.  Therefore, if a person wears his/her watch on the right hand with this intention, he/she will merit thawāb, inshāAllāh. \n\n \n\nAs for permissibility, to wear the watch in either hand is permissible without any dislike, as long as the above two conditions are met.\n\n \n\n(فتاوى محمودية، كتاب الحظر والإباحة، باب استعمال الذهب والفضة، الفصل الرابع: 19/360-361؛ فاروقية)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMufti  Abrar Mirza, (Chicago, US)\nChecked and Approved by:\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
