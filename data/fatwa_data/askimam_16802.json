  "question": "This article shows the Sahaba did not regard masturbation as a sin",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni found the following article on the internet. it shows that the sahaba did not regard Masturbation as a sin. Do you agree with it?\n\nMasturbation: Comments by the Sahaabah\n\nThe following article is reprinted from the Renaissance Islamic Journal, http://www.renaissance.com.pk/\n\n\nQuestion: How is the act of masturbation seen in Islam. Is it a sin? If it is, then what is the punishment for it?\n\nAnswer: There is no explicit directive of the Shari `ah which forbids masturbation. In other words, it is silent on this issue. Consequently, it cannot be regarded as a sin. The verses from which its prohibition is usually derived, I am afraid, have another meaning (than that commonly ascribed).\n\nThe opinions of some of the companions of the Prophet (saws) reproduced below from Ibn Hazam’s al-Muhalla (Vol:11, pp. 393-4) indicate that (while they may have discouraged it) they did not forbid it:\n\nIbn 'Abbaas:\n\n\"Marrying a slave girl is better than it, and it is better than fornication (zinaa).\"\n\"It is nothing but rubbing one’s private parts until a fluid comes out.\"\n\nIbn `Umar:\n\n\"A person who does makes a fool of himself.\"\n\"It is merely rubbing an organ.\"\n\nJaabir Ibn Zayd:\n\n\"It is your water; you can discharge it [if you want].\"\n\nHasan Basri:\n\n\"There is no harm in it.\"\n\nAt best, masturbation can be termed as an undesirable act similar in nature to the emotions of anger and hate. Such emotions are generally against good conduct, and a person should try to control them as much as possible. However, there may be situations when they may play a somewhat positive role -- especially when they save you from a sin.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nWe have viewed the article forward by you and the website link provided. Unfortunately we disagree with the research as it is against the teachings of Shari’a. The Shari’a is clear on the issue of masturbation and to deem it otherwise is incorrect. The person who has answered the query has claimed that people have misunderstood the verse of Qur’an usually presented for the prohibition of masturbation and that the verse has another meaning. Firstly, it should be understood that the Qur’an does not go into details for each and every issue of Shari’a. Many a times an issue will be discussed very generally, but the righteous scholars have derived rulings from these general verses.  Secondly, the interpretation of the ‘Ulama of the past such as the Sahaba, Tabi’in, the Imams of Fiqh will be taken over the pseudo-scholars of today’s time.\n\nQur’an describes the qualities of true believers and as follows:\n\nوَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِفُرُوجِهِمْ حَافِظُونَ .  إِلَّا عَلَى أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ غَيْرُ مَلُومِينَ . فَمَنِ ابْتَغَى وَرَاءَ ذَلِكَ فَأُولَئِكَ هُمُ الْعَادُونَ\n\nAnd those who guard their private parts, except from their wives or from those (bondwomen who are) owned by their hands, as they are not to be blamed. However, those that seek (sexual pleasure) beyond that are the transgressors.  (23/5-7 & 70/29-31)\n\nThe verse is clear on praising the believers who restrict the avenues of the fulfillment of their desire to their wives and slave-women. Afterwards, it brings a general statement that the transgressors are those who seek the fulfillment of their desires by any other means besides these two avenues.\n\nIbn Kathir (ra) commenting on the above verse writes:\n\n“Imam Shaf’i (ra) and those sharing the same view take proof from this verse on the impermissibility of masturbation and says, “The disgraceful act (of masturbating) is not from these two (lawful) options and the verse states that ‘those that seek sexual pleasure beyond that are the transgressors’””.\n(Ibn Kathir (3/226) Dar al-Mufeed)\n\nAllama Alusi (ra) in Ruh al-Ma’ani under this verse writes:\n\n“And there is a difference of opinion also on the issue of masturbation.  The majority of the ‘Ulama are of the view of its prohibition.  Masturbation is included in the verse “and those that seek (sexual pleasure) beyond that…”\n\nSaeed ibn Jubayr (ra) narrates:\n\n“Allah will punish those who fondle with their private parts.”\n\nAata (ra) narrates that he heard:\n\n“A nation will be resurrected such that their hand will be pregnant.  I believe they are the ones that masturbate.  And Allah Knows Best.”\n\n(Ruh al-Ma’ani (9/213) Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyya)\n\nImam Qurutbi in his Tafsir in Surah Al-Mu’minun under the words وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِفُرُوجِهِمْ حَافِظُونَ writes:\n\n“Muhammad ibn al-Hakm says that he heard Harmalata ibn Abdul-Aziz saying that he asked Imam Malik (ra) regarding masturbation. Imam Malik recited:\n\nوَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِفُرُوجِهِمْ حَافِظُونَ (5) إِلَّا عَلَى أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ غَيْرُ مَلُومِينَ (6) فَمَنِ ابْتَغَى وَرَاءَ ذَلِكَ فَأُولَئِكَ هُمُ الْعَادُونَ (7)\n\nShari’a recognizes the urge to fulfill their carnal desires.  It is for this reason Rasulullah (Sallalahu ‘Alayhi Wasallam) said:\n\nعن عبد الله قال قال لنا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يا معشر الشباب من استطاع منكم الباءة فليتزوج فإنه أغض للبصر وأحصن للفرج ومن لم يستطع فعليه بالصوم فإنه له وجاء (متفق عليه)\n\n‘Abdullah ibn Mas’ud narrates that Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) said to us, “O youngsters, whom so ever amongst you are able to marry, then let him do so, for verily it helps lower the gazes and protects the private parts.  And who so ever does not have the ability to marry then let him fast, for it is a shield for him. (Sahih al-Bukhari & Sahih Muslim)\n\nTherefore, the act of masturbation according to the majority of the scholars is impermissible. Regarding Ibn Hazm (ra) and his views regarding masturbation, firstly we would like to state that we follow the Hanafi Madhhab and adhere to its ruling. The Hanafi ‘Ulama regard it to be impermissible and upon it is our view. Secondly, Ibn Hazm (ra) is known for his radical views on many issues for which none besides him have accepted. The Four Imams; Imam Abu Hanifa (ra) Imam Malik (ra), Imam Shafi’i (ra), and the most correct view (اصح) of Imam Ahmad is that masturbation is impermissible.\n\nAs for the views of Ibn ‘Abbas and Ibn ‘Umar (Radiyallahu 'Anhuma), then Ibn Hazm himself regards the chains for these narrations to be weak.\n\nقال أبو محمد رحمه الله: الأسانيد عن ابن عباس , وابن عمر في كلا القولين  مغموزة – المحلى 12/403 دار الفكر بيروت\n\nAs for Jabir ibn Ziyad (ra) and Hasan al-Basri, then they are not from the Sahaba. There were other Tabi’in holding the contrary view to these two as mentioned above.\n\nIt is also possible to reconcile the statements of permissibility with the verse of the Qur’an. The permissibility will be in time of extreme needs such as a person being in a situation where he fears he will commit adultery. The Hanafi scholars have written that such a person will be excused in order to save himself from the sin of adultery, adopting the lesser of two evils.\n\nوكذا الاستمناء بالكف وإن كره تحريما لحديث { ناكح اليد ملعون } ولو خاف الزنى يرجى أن لا وبال عليه ...قال ابن عابدين: ( قوله : ولو خاف الزنى إلخ ) الظاهر أنه غير قيد بل لو تعين الخلاص من الزنى به وجب ؛ لأنه أخف وعبارة الفتح فإن غلبته الشهوة ففعل إرادة تسكينها به فالرجاء أن لا يعاقب – رد المحتار (2/399) سعيد\n\nIt should also be pointed out that a person should avoid any such act that will aggravate his desires.  He should lower his gaze, avoid mixed gatherings, avoid reading immoral literature, etc.  If one’s desires are aroused after guarding oneself from all forms of evil, then only will one be excused in an unavoidable situation.  The above ruling is not for a person who aggravates his desires and leads his passion to an unavoidable situation.  In that instance he will be sinful for leading himself to a point of aggravating circumstances of sexual desires and for masturbating.  For that he must repent for his sin and make effort to reform himself.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
