  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs Salaamu Alayakum\n\nI have a Question regarding a work application. I am a computer programmer currently working for a Muslim/Indian company. Unfortunately, the pay is the extremely low. Compared with other companies, it is around a 25% of what is available for the same job elsewhere. The type of work that we do is designing computer programs to keep track of all monetery/business related aspects of the company, eg. Debtors, Creditors, Stock, Ledgers,Â  etc.\nWe install teh programs on the machines and set them up at the premises.\n\n\nA job is a available at a non-Muslim owned company with excellent pay. This company has many clients including a company involved in the gambling industry. We would simply be providing a computer service for that company.\nIs this permissible?\n\nAnother job is also available, creating applications for cellular phones (including games. Is such a job permissible?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is permissible to work for a non-Muslim company and provide computer service on condition the service is not directly related to an un-Islamic activity. For example, if you have to set up a gambling mechanism on the computer, that is un-Islamic and it cannot be used for anything else.\n\nYou may request the non-Muslim company to excuse you from such services. It is also advisable for you to offer your service and skills in creating applications for cell phones even thought the cell phones do have games.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
