  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalamalikom. I have not been feeling well the past few months. Please give me a dua so I can feel better by the mercy of Allah. 1.) My cousin had a dream in which a person told her that I have been sick because I slept in someone?s basement. Can you please interpret this? I cant recall sleeping in anyones basement in the past few month. I usually hang out in my friends basement, that?s about it. 2.) Is Sheikh Hisham Kabbani an authentic ulema?3.) Was Ibn Tayimma a fabricator as Sheikh Hisham claims? Jazak Allah Khairun.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The Dream has no significance.\n\n2. We do not know Shaykh Kabbani.\n\n3. Shaykh Taqi-u-ddin Ahmad ibn Taymiyah (RA) and ibn Qayyim (RA) were great scholars and luminaries of their time. They had some independent views which they were entitled to according to their scholarly and academic research.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
