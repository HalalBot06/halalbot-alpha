  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamualaikum wa Rehmetullah Hope this letter finds you in best of Imaan, Amaal, Health and Happiness. Sir, I would like to know if there is anything mentioned in Shariat about Impotence. A religious young person of age 27 having a very good health, figure and urge to marry, but cannot hold erection for more than 3 to 4 minutes is about to get married but fears the worst. No consultation with any Doctor has been done. Is it lawful to marry. JazakALLAH Wassalaam, Note Please also print the reply on your website Q & A without mentioning the name as this is a problem faced by many people.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari'ah, an Inneen (impotent) person should not marry\nuntil he undergoes treatment and cures himself. If he is a married person,\nhis wife may request an annulment of the marriage.\n\nWe advise the person in question seek medical advise immediately.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
