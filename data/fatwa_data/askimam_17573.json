  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan I receive interest deliberately from saving account and give it to needy people without hoping for a reward? I just don't feel good if bank makes profit from my money if I have a chequing(non-interest) account.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nIn principle the facilities of conventional banking can be used due to need and necessity. Therefore, if you are putting your money into a savings account, the interest money must be given to the poor and needy with no intention of receiving reward. \n\n(Ahsan ul-Fatawa, 7/16, Saeed)\n(Mahmoodiya, 16/381, Farooqiyah)\n\n(Contemporary Fatawaa, 242, Islamiat)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\nMl.
