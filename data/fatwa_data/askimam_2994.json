  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn a book a found a picture of the Holy Kaa'ba and in it infront of all the people performing sajda there is a whitish object, it does not appear to be a camra error or blur, is it possible that it could be a angel ro jinn? and how may I send you this picture?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen the cloth of the Ka'bah is held and shaken at the bottom, a rippling\neffect taken place in it starting from the bottom going upwards.\n\nThis ripple, coupled with the bright rays of the powerful flood lights\nportrays to the onlooker at the Ka'bah the image of mist ascending from the\nhearts of those making Tawaaf.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
