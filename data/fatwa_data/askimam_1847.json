  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen reading salaat I can feel Ihave trapped wind but I cannot work out if the wind is exiting via the hole. If the wind moves about in the area but does not exist via the holethen my wudhu should be okI have read the article ?RULES RELATING TO THE MA'ZUR? I am still not sure. I have a problem keeping wudhu. When performing my salaat I can feel I have trapped wind but I cannot work out if the wind is exiting via the hole. I assume if the wind moves about in the area but does not exist via the hole then my wudhu should be ok.. I had a baby several months ago. After the birth the hospital doctors advised to me to take a germane measles injection because of this injection the doctor gave me another injection to prevent me from becoming pregnet (The germane measles injection may have side affects therefore you are advised not no get pregent for first two months) After 3 months I went to see my doctor because I was still bleeding daily. I was told it should stop after 4 months and the bleeding was caused by the injection. After 4 months I am still bleeding daily ( the amounts is reducing) . I change my pad before each Salaat and make a fresh wudhu. After speaking to another sister. I was told I should count 10 days in menstruations (No salaat to be performed) and the next 20 days as normal(even though I am bleeding it will be counted a disease). Am I following the correct policy? If not what should I do. ______\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Your understanding is correct that until the trapped wind does not exit,\nyour Wudhu will be valid.\n2. The advise of the sister is correct. You should regard ten days as Haydh\n(menses) and twenty days as Istihaadha (disease). There is no Salaat during\nHaydh. During Istihaadha, clean yourself and make a fresh Wudhu before eash\nFardh Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
