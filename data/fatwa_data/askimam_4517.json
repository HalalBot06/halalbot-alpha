  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-wa-alakum wa rahmatullah mufti sahab. Can you please interpret my dream? I was in a room, with dim lighiting and i had just shott a robot. I was inspecting its dead body when it suddenly came to life and and tryed shooting me. the man i was with tryed holding it back while i ran. it still kept shooting at me i was running form side to side trying to dodge it. The next thing i remeber was i was on the ground and it was about to kill me. I said \"inna ilayhi and inna ilahi ragoon\" and it turned away. it explained to me i could say that or allahuakber allahuakber lailaha illah hu wallah hu akber wa lilahil hambed. it turned towards me again and told me i had one day to live and i woke up. I remeber reciting ayatul kursi 3 times before i went to sleep and allahuma bismika amutu wa ahya befoire i went to sleep before i had that dream. also i remeber having about 2 dreams before this with the same man and in the same encolsed dark space and he was killing people. jazakhallah khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream is an indication that turning one's gaze to Allah Ta'ala and\nmaking His Dhikr is an effective repellant against the Shaytaan and its\nmischief.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
