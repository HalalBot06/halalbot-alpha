  "question": "What does Islam says about masturbation for man and about shemales?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSOLO SEX (MALE AND FEMALE MASTURBATION)%0D%0A%0D%0AThose who achieve insufficient satisfaction from sexual intercourse and%0D%0Areturn to masturbation, or never give it up, the torments are great.%0D%0AEverywhere they look, their friends are unashamedly enjoying the pleasures%0D%0Aof normal sexual relationship. No part of society caters for them and they%0D%0Aare even cowardly shy to campaign for \"Masturbators Liberation.\" Sex life%0D%0Afor most of them is fairly empty.%0D%0A%0D%0AOne of the most humiliating problems that the constant male masturbator%0D%0Asuffers from when he attempts to have sexual relationship is premature%0D%0Aejaculation or the failure to maintain an erection. When he is masturbating,%0D%0Ahe tends to reach his orgasm as quickly as possible, but in sexual%0D%0Aintercourse he normally has to attempt to control his excitement, which can%0D%0Aimpose a great strain on a person who indulged in self-abuse over a lengthy%0D%0A%0Aperiod.%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore people who continuously masturbate, lose out all round. The%0D%0Aphysical pleasure becomes reduced to a natural act like urination, or%0D%0Aexcreting, and at the back of their minds there is an awareness that they%0D%0Aare missing on the real pleasures of life. No adult can honestly claim to%0D%0Amasturbate without a guilty feeling of complete uselessness. Masturbation is%0D%0Amerely an exhaustive, rather than constructive undertaking, resulting in%0D%0Anothing but total loss. Once orgasm has been achieved there is Nothing else%0D%0Aleft, except for a feeling of complete emptiness.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe following extracts from the writings of a dignified physician of the%0D%0AUnani medicine will give one some idea of the damage done through%0D%0Amasturbation: \"Most often, students, bachelors or widowers and hypocritical%0D%0Agodly persons are its victims. It is such an evil practice that has ruined%0D%0Amany families and many more are being ruined today. The lack of manly vigor%0D%0Aand decline in the standard of young men's health is evidence enough for%0D%0Athis horrible social evil, eating into the vitals of an otherwise healthy%0D%0Anation. If only our young men could foresee the consequences of this evil at%0D%0Atheir own hands bring on them! It can be said with some certainty that%0D%0Aeighty percent of our young men are the victims of masturbation. This%0D%0Aaccursed practice affects equally the heart, the brain, the liver, the%0D%0Astomach, the kidneys along with the reproductive organs. This practice makes%0D%0Athe muscles and the nerves of the reproductive organ sagging and lifeless.%0D%0AAccumulation of fluids in the veins makes it unfit for its normal function.%0D%0AThere is extreme feebleness in the power of erection. The heat of the%0D%0Afriction between the delicate muscles of the organ and the tough hide of the%0D%0Ahand damages the former beyond repair.\" (Miftahi, Modesty and Chastity in%0D%0AIslam)%0D%0A%0D%0AFollowing the excitement which accompanies masturbation, comes the feeling%0D%0Aof shame, anger, humiliation, and the sense of futility. This sense of%0D%0Aguilty and humiliation deepens as the years go on, into a suppressed rage,%0D%0Abecause of the impossibility to escape. The one thing that it seems%0D%0Aimpossible to escape from, once the habit is formed, is masturbation. It%0D%0Agoes on and on, on into old age, in spite of marriage. And it always carries%0D%0Athis secret feeling of futility and humiliation. And this is, perhaps, the%0D%0Adeepest and most dangerous cancer of our civilization. Instead of being a%0D%0Acomparatively harmless vice, masturbation is certainly the most dangerous%0D%0Asexual vice that a society can be afflicted with, in the long run.%0D%0A%0D%0AMASTURBATION UNDER ISLAMIC LAW%0D%0AIslam strictly forbids the waste of seminal fluid through masturbation. The%0D%0Aone who discharges his seminal fluid with his hand is damned. This evil%0D%0Apractice removes the normal bright look of a man's face, and he looks%0D%0Amelancholy and dejected. He loses his health and quite frequently his%0D%0Avitality and sexual stamina through this disgusting practice.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Qur'aan declares: \"The Believers are those who abstain from sex except%0D%0Awith those joined to them in marriage bond, or those whom their righht hand%0D%0Apossess for (in their case) they are free from blame, but those who crave%0D%0Asomething beyond that are transgressors.\"%0D%0A%0D%0ABeyond the wife and slave woman all ways and means of sexual satisfaction%0D%0Aare unlawful. They include adultery, sodomy, masturbation, etc. From this it%0D%0Acan be deduced that masturbation falls under the context 'but those who%0D%0Acrave ...' and is therefore immoral and a sin in Islam. Views expressed by%0D%0Athe Shafi'i jurists on this matter are clearly illustrated by Imam Nawawi%0D%0Awhose opinion is typical of the Shafi'i Jurists as a whole. He declared that%0D%0Amasturbation was absolutely forbidden. It was only permitted when it was%0D%0Aperformed by the hand of a man's wife or concubine, for he has a right to%0D%0Athe enjoyment of her hand as he has to the rest of her body.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AThe author of Subul al Salam according to al-Juzairi, states: \"Some of the%0D%0AHanbali and Hanafi Jurists are of the opinion that masturbation may be%0D%0Apermissible in the event that one fears (that is, not engaging in it) would%0D%0Alead to his committing adultery, fornication. But be cautious that such a%0D%0Aview is weak and is not to be relied upon.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AAccording to Maliki school of thought masturbation is deduced to be illegal%0D%0Afrom the following hadith narrated by 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhu): \"We were with the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) while we were%0D%0Ayoung and had no wealth whatsoever. The Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) said: \"O assembly of youths ; whoever among you possesses the%0D%0Aphysical and financial resources to marry, should do so, because it helps%0D%0Ahim guard his modesty, and whoever is unable to marry, should fast, as%0D%0Afasting diminishes his sexual power.'%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore, the jurists of this school are of the opinion that if%0D%0Amasturbation was permitted, the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) would%0D%0Ahave acknowledged its permissibility because this is much simpler than%0D%0Afasting. Since the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) did not mention it,%0D%0Ademonstrates that it is prohibited.%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the evidence presented so far, it can be seen that Shari'ah not only%0D%0Aclassifies this type of unnatural waste of seminal fluid as illegal, but%0D%0Aalso advocated strict measures for its prevention.%0D%0A%0D%0A[ Morality in Islam, Acaciaville]"
