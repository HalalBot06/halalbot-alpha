  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nEbu Amr ed-Dâni the Quran has 6000 ayats Ýsmail b. Cafer the Quran has 6214 ayats Ehl-i Mekke the Quran has 6219 ayats Ehl-i Kufah the Quran has 6236 ayats The people of Basra the Quran has 6204 ayats The people of Aleppo (Sham) the Quran has 6226 ayats Zemahsheri the Quran has 6666 ayats\n\nIs this correct? And who is this Zemahsheri with 6666 ayats?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nA difference of opinion exists regarding the number of Aayaats in the Qur’aan. This difference of opinion is based upon how the Qur’aan was divided into Aayaats. The Qur’aan which is read today is the same Qur’aan revealed to Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam].\n\nThe great scholar Abu Amraddin [ra] has mentioned that there is unanimity of the Aayaats being 6000. Other different opinions on the number of Aayaats 6204, 6214, 6219, 6225, 6236\n\nSome considered Bismillah to be an Aayat of every Surah. Sometimes, Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] would stop at the end of an Aayat to show the Sahaaba that this is the end of the Aayat. This was done when an Aayat was revealed. Other times, when a few Aayaat had one theme or topic, then they would be joined from the aspect of the meaning and picture painted by those Aayaat.\n\nNote: This difference of opinion does not mean that some scholars considered the Qur’aan to be shorter or more lengthy. No difference exists with the content of the Qur’aan. The difference is that some would consider 1 Aayat to be 2 Aayaats and vice versa.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
