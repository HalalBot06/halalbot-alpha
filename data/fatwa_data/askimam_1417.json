  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am confused please help me out. Scientist says there was a comet which hit earth and human beings were destroy.It was total destruction and if that is true then when did Hazarat Adam A.S.came to earth. Because we have read in Quran sharif tht Hazarat Adam A.S. was first person on earth. What is truth behind dinasours?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe creation of Allah Taãla is very vast and beyond our comprehension. In\nevery time and era scientists have made strange discoveries of the creation\nof Allah and they will continue to do so. However, the research of the\nscientists will be exhausted yet they will never be able to conquer the\nreality of the creations of Allah, nor will they be able to discover even a\nfraction of the entire creation.\n\nHowever, the creation of Allah is a manifestation of the Power of Allah.\nAllah invites us to ponder upon His creation and understand His Power. With\nregard to aliens and flying objects and dinasours, since the reality of\nthese creations are not known, it is not possible to comment upon them. For\nour belief, if there is reality in these creations, it should be seen as\nanother manifestation of Allah's Power.\n\nAnd Allah Taãla Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
