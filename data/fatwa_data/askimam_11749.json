  "question": "What are \"Mamathees and Hayathees\"?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu-alaikum, Brother, what are \"Mamathees and Hayathees\"? I will explain...a scholar called Maulana Yunus Nomani came to a local masjid, some people started to say do not give him charity because he is a \"Mamathee\", they claim to be linked to the madrassah Deoband but are actually misguided. They were saying that they have belief like the \"Wahhabis\" like do not believe that the Prophet sallallahoaihiwasalam is alive which sometimes leads to becoming a \"Usmani\"(?????!!!!). They (the people who where talking about Maulana Younus Nomani) said that they are \"Hayatis\" and they believe that the Prophet salallahoalaiwasalam is alive and so are the other Prophets peace and blessings of Allah be upon them all and so are the Shaheeds. Please explain is this true about \"Mamaathees and Hayatis\"? What is Usmani? If it is true (about Mamathees and Hayathees) please tell me according to Qur'an and Sunnah who is right? Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe are unaware of the terminology of Hayatees and Mamathees, however they seem to be referring to the famous controversial topic of Hayatul Ambiyaa (Are the Prophets Alaihimus Salam alive in their graves).\n\nThe view of the wahabi/Salafis is that Nabi sallalahu Alaihi wasallam and all the other ambiyaa as well are not alive in their grave. This view has been incorrectly attributed to the Ulama of Depband. The correct view on the topic is that the Ambiyaa and Shuhadaa are alive in their graves, in a manner like that of their lives in this world, without having to do any Ibadat etc. (Hayaatun Dunyaweeyah bilaa Takleefin). This is the unanimous belief of the Ulama of Deoband and has been mentioned in the book \"AL-Muhannad alal Mufannad\" (Pg. 38) which clearly states the beliefs of the Ulama of deoband and which as been attested to by all the senior Ulama of deoband.\n\nWe are unaware of who is an Uthmani.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim De"
