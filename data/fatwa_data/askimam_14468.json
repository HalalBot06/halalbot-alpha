  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease answer immediately, the question about halaah chicken\n\nI am working in Saudi Arabia, in most of the hotels I find chicken imported from western countries. Even in Saudi Arabia also now a days the chicken centres from where we were taking chicken before are going to be closed where we get live chicken which we used to slaughter. In farms from where we are getting chicken is mechanically slaughterd, that means there will be no bismillah before slaughter, and also before taking out the stomach, these birds are passed through boiled water to remove the feathers, please tell the authenticity.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nChicken imported from western countries is, if not Haraam, at least doubtful. Also, the chickens slaughtered mechanically are considered Haraam.\n\nThe best for you would be to abstrain from consuming chicken that are imported and sold in the shops there. Rather, purchase from shops that sell only locally slaughtered chickens or buy live chickens and slaughter them on your own.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
