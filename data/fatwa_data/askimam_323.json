  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssalaamu %C1laykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0AHereunder is the reply to your query.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Shar%E9e relationship between CCC, the consumer and the merchant must be%0D%0Aexamined before determining the validity of the transaction. The%0D%0Arelationship between CCC and the consumer is of a lender and borrower. This%0D%0Ais apparent from the first paragraph of the document where the CCC%0D%0Aundertakes to provide finance to the merchant's customers and settle the%0D%0Amerchant's invoice. It is obvious and known that the consumer will pay the%0D%0ACCC a bigger amount over an extended period of time. Therefore, this will be%0D%0Ainterest being paid on a loan. Hence this is not permissible.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe relationship between the consumer and the merchant is that of buying and%0D%0Aselling. However, since it is established that the relationship between the%0D%0ACCC and the consumer involves transacting in interest, it is not correct for%0D%0Athe seller (merchant) to accept payment of the CCC. This will be aiding in%0D%0Asin and not permissible. In fact, it will not be permissible to even enter%0D%0Ainto a deal of buying and selling due to the condition of arranging finance%0D%0Awith the CCC who will charge the consumer interest. The Fuqahaa have stated%0D%0Athat any condition contrary to the Shari%E1h made in the actual deal nullifies%0D%0Athe transaction.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs an alternative, if the CCC transforms its principles and conforms with%0D%0Athe principles of Muraabaha, wherein the CCC purchases the item from the%0D%0Amerchant and sells it to the consumer on a higher fixed price, this would be%0D%0Apermissible.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta%E3la Knows Best.%0D%0A%0D%0AWas salaam%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A"
