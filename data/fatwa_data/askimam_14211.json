The official ruling of the Shaafi’ee Madhab is that the mere meeting of the skin of a woman and man will break the Wudhu. This ruling applies to non-Mahrams only (including one’s wife) as well as with or without desire. (Fiqhul Islam wa adillatuhu vol.1 pg.427)\n\n2. The services of an exorcist may be adopted as a treatment against witchcrafts, etc. provided one is not required to utter anything or act in a manner that is against the dictates of Imaan and the prestine Shari’ah.\n\n3. Kindly refer to www.almahmood.org for entire Silsila of Hadhrat Mufti Mahmood Saheb.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
