  "question": "Is the name Nisa a permissable Muslim name?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI know that the name is derived from the Holy Quran however the meaning is of no particular significance (Nisa=women). Should that be a deterrant in naming our daughter this? Can we simply be content with the name being from our Holy book?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNabi (sallallah alayhi wa sallam) has mentioned that we will be called by our names and by the names of our fathers, so we must keep good names. In another hadeeth it is narrated that Nabi (sallallah alayhi wa sallam) use to change those names that were bad. In yet another hadeet we learn that Nabi (sallallah alayhi wa sallam) use to change those name that had a bad meaning. Nabi (sallallah alayhi wa sallam) personally changed names that had a bad meaning. In light of the above hadeet we learn that it is of utmost importance that we name our children with good names that have a good meaniing. The name \"NISA\" is an arabic word which translates as \"WOMEN\" in english. It would sound derogrative if your loved daughter is called out \"He! Women come here\". %0D%0A%0D%0ASimilarly the word may be used in a derogrative manner. It would be advised to keep another name, for example \"AMATULLAH\" meaning female servant of ALLAH. In another hadeet we learn that this is the most loved names by ALLAH. ALLAH guide us to keep beautiful names for our children.
