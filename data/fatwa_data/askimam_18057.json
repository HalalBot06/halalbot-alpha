  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nNowadays people have a tendency to get their sons and daughters married in the Noble and Sacred cities of Makkah and Madinah. Deafeating the whole purpose of visiting these places and the virtues that behold these places. Could you kinldy elaborate more on this point.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nIn principle, it is permissible for a boy and girl to get married in the sacred cities of Makkah and Madinah. However, travelling there solely for this intention is not appropriate. The proper intention should be to perform Umrah, Hajj, and Ibadah solely for the pleasure of Allah Ta’ala.\n\nUnfortunately, extravagance in weddings has become more and more common. If people will be travelling long distances to the sacred cities just for the sake of marriage, then lots of unnecessary money will be spent as well. Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) clearly mentioned:\n\nعن عائشة أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال \"إن أعظم النكاح بركة أيسره مؤنة\". (رواه البيهقي في \" شعب الإيمان)\n\nIt has been narrated by Ai’shah (Radhiyallahu Anha) that Nabi (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “The most blessed wedding is that which has the least expenses”.\n\nHereunder is a detailed article on the crisis of extravagant marriages:\n\nhttp://al-inaam.com/fataawa/marriage_crisis_wedding.htm\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
