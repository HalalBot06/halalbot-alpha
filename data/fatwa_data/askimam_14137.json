  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nthey say that it is hasid, but i still love him i don't want to leave him please help!\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nJazakallah for your mail to the institute. May Allah Ta'ala in his infinite mercy grant both of you a lasting and fulfilling marriage and help you to overcome the present problem, ameen. Sister, has your husband been examined by a doctor? Please do take him to one if he has not been for professional help. There may just be some simple tests which need to be conducted. If it is found that the problem is somewhat complicated, then you may be referred to the relevant professional folk within the medical field for expert help.\n\nThis problem is sometimes a minor one and sometimes not. It is best to make dua and at the same time seek constructive help.\n\nThe time period for you to remain with him depends on the findings of the relevant professional folk and your own decision thereafter. It all fails, you could perhaps seek the assistance of an aamil. May Allah Ta'ala reward you for your patience. Ameen.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best.\n\nSister Fadila\nSocial Dept\n\nCHECKEDH & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
