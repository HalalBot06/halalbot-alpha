  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it o.k. if I change my pants at the end of each day to remove doubts  about  impurities that might have been on them during the day. I cant change them every 5 minutes now can I. And In this case do I need to have a quick shower at night?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIf there are no impurities on your pants, there is no incumbency in Shariah to change it or to take a shower.\n\nThis conduct may lead you to feeding your baseless doubts which may lead to paranoia and being a target of the whispers of Shaytaan.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
