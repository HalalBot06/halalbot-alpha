  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan we give Zakat on gold ,even that we are having it a period of less than 4 months ? Or else can we calculate it like total Zakat/3 ....please correct us if we are wrong?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nYou will only have to give zakah on gold if:\n\nit is equal or more than the nisab of gold (i.e 87.479 grams) or if it is equal or more than the nisab of silver (i.e 612.35 grams). In other words, lesser of the two nisabs.\nand you have it in your possession for one Islamic year.1\n\nHowever, if you have assets on which the zakah is due, then no matter how much gold you have, you will have to add it to the rest of assets and calculate zakah on total amount.\n\n (Ahsanul Fatwa, Vol.4, Pg.264, HM Saīd)1\n\n(Bahishti Zewar, Pg.240, Makki Darul Kutub)\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl. Abduz Zaman,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nConcurred by: Ml. Abdur Rahman Shareef, Student Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nUnder the guidance of:\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai Saheb\nDārul Iftā"
