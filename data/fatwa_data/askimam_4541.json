  "question": "Is our prophet Mohammed (pbuh) alive with his presence surrounding us or is he alive but only in heaven and can only hear us when we are at his graveside",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamalikaum mufi sahib. I am much confused about this question. I know a few brothers who say that our prophet mohammed (PBUH) is alive and his presence surrounds us and he was alive all of the time even before Adam and still is today. There explanation for this is that our prophet was not an ordinary human being, but was was made from the noor of allah and therefore can not just simply die and go to heaven like normal humans as he was the messenger of allah and will live for ever. But I have other brothers saying that this is wrong and that our prophet is alive, but only in heaven and can only hear us, when we are at his grave, and also it is a big sin if we believe that he is around us today and is alive. These brothers also say that it is wrong to say 'YA' Rasulallah . I will be gratefull if you could explain and clarify this to me as to whom is right and who is wrong and if possible provide evidence from quran and hadith with your answer. Jazakallah khair for your help. May allah (swt) bless you\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) After Rasulullah Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam passed on from this world,%0D%0Ahe remained alive in his blessed grave. He was not alive before his birth.%0D%0AAllah Subhaanahu wa ta'ala created the souls of all humans before their%0D%0Abirth. Similarly Allah Subhaanahu wa ta'ala created the soul of Rasulullah%0D%0ASallallahu alayhi wa sallam before his birth. He was granted life in the%0D%0Awomb of his mother. He did not pass away like other humans do. He was%0D%0Agranted a special type of life in his blessed grave.%0D%0A2) At the same time it is erroneous to say that he is everywhere at one and%0D%0Athe same time. This is an exclusive quality of Allah Subhaanahu wa ta'ala.%0D%0AOnly Allah Subhaanahu wa ta'ala is omnipresent.%0D%0A3) If one uses the term \"Ya\" with the belief that Rasulullah Sallallahu%0D%0Aalayhi wa sallam is omnipresent, then this is clearly wrong. Since some%0D%0Afalse sects use this term with the express intention that Rasulullah%0D%0ASallallahu alayhi wa sallam is omnipresent, it is best to completely avoid%0D%0Athis term.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
