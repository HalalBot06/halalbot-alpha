  "question": "While fasting I did masturbation until i reached orgasm. 1)Is my Fast valid?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a female and single. While fasting I did masturbation by rubbing my clitoris with my hands until i reached orgasm. I did not insert my finger into my vagina.However my vagina becomes very wet because of my action. 1)Is my Fast valid?2) Do i have to Qada' and pay penalty?3)Do i have to make ghusl for female masturbation?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe purpose of fasting is to exercise resistance against the Nafs and inculcate Taqwa. You have given in to your Nafs and deprived yourself from that. However, it is praiseworthy to note that you realized that and regret your action. You should make a firm intention never to repeat a filthy and dirty act. You may search on our site for our article on some guidelines to abstain from masturbation. In the case mentioned, due to masturbation and reaching orgasm, the fast will be invalidated. You will have to make up those fasts..\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
