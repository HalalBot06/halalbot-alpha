  "question": "Do we have to sleep first to pray tahajjud salaat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBoth forms of Tahajjud are correct - before sleep and after sleep.\n\nIt was the noble habit of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) to sleep\nand then wake up for Tahajjud. If one is unable to wake up for Tahajjud,\nthen one may perform Tahajjud before going to sleep.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
