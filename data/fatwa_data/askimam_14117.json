  "question": "please tell me why so many people have this stupid confusion about wahabees and deobandis being the same when there is a great difference",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Myself I come from a brelwi background but have recently changed my belief to deobandi after disagreeing with brelwi practices. A lot of family members are pressing me to change back thinking that deobandies and wahabees are the same. I get VERY angry when people say this because I know its not true. Please tell me how I should prove to them the difference between wahabees and deobandies. Also please tell me why so many people have this stupid confusion about wahabees and deobandis being the same when there is a great difference. 2. I unknowingly did hajj this year with a wahabee group. Do you advise I do hajj again as they didn’t read 40 salah in Madhina and didn’t let anyone read sunnat mukadda salah in Mina saying it’s bidat and sin because Allah has given us concession. 3 are wahabees and ahle hadith 2 different groups or the same?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. It would be more appropriate and effective to request your family members the beliefs of the Wahhabis. If they present the beliefs of the Wahhabis to you, you would be able to point out to them their misunderstanding. Very often, people have a misconception based on hearsay and not on sound knowledge. It is possible that your relatives will not be able to even point out to you the beliefs of the Wahhabis.\n\n2. It is Mustahabb to perform 40 Salaats in the Musjid of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. This is proven from Hadith. If a person is a Muqeem, then he had to perform his Sunnat-e-Muakkadah Salaats even if he is in Mina. If he is a Musaafir, and has time at hand, it is advisable for him to perform the Sunnat-e-Muakkadah Salaats. It is not necessary for him to do so.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
