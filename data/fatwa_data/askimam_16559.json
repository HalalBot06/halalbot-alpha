  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a question regarding living with others.  I am a male muslim getting ready to move to a new city for school.  I am looking to find a place with a friend of mine (who is also a male).  We have found many places, but the only ones that we can afford require us to live with others.  We have found a 4 bedroom house with two people already living there.  The only issue that I see is that the other two people living at the house are females.  Me and my roommate would be living on a different floor from the females.  We would have our own living room, bathroom, and bedrooms.  We would however be sharing a common entrance to the house as well as a kitchen.  I know it is not permissible to live with someone of the opposite sex, but could there be an exception to this living arrangement because the only time I would see them is when I am going to be making/eating food.  Thank you for the help.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThe strong possibility of fitna still exists as your’ll will be living in the same house sharing a common entrance and the kitchen. Sleeping on a different floor with a separate bathroom does not negate the strong possibility of fitna in staying in the same house. It is therefore not permissible to share the house with other females.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
