  "question": "Is the validity of wudu in changing a child's diaper dependent on age?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nYou have mentioned that changing a child's diaper or cleaning a child does not invalidate one's wudu, regardless whether the baby's urine or stool come in contact with one's hands. This is surprising to me. I would therefore like to know if there is some age limit of the child which then makes our wudu invalid after cleaning him/her. JazakAllah in advance.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is no age limit for the ruling. In principle, if any impurity comes on one?s hands or any part of the body, that does not invalidate the Wudhu.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
