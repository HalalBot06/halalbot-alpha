  "question": "Two ?'s: risq and current situation",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) What is the best thing to read (dikr) for risq? 2) My husband and I have very differing opinions of the current situation. We both make du'a for those being oppressed in Afghanistan, but we tend to have different ways of doing so. I pray for ALlah's mercy and help, and for the dawah of the aggressors. My husband prays for the enemy planes to fall out the sky. Everytime he reads/hears of casualties on the side of the enemy, he is happy and says \"Allahuakbar!\"...I wince. I believe that the Prophet (saw) would not condone such a mentality, that Islam is about praying for those who aggress against us as well. I believe that that is the true essence of Islam, to be peaceful and forgiving. My husband continually reminds me of the instance where the Prophet (saw) was asked for help, and he sent 70 hafiz-e-quran, who were ambushed and all killed. The Prophet then made dua against them in the form of Qunoot-e-Nazila. He insists that this shows that the Prophet (saw) was forgiving of trespasses done against him, but not when his fellow-Muslims were harmed. very confused.... Pleas advise..JazakAllah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. A Du'aa that one can make for rizq is, \"Oh Allah give me sustenance that\nis Halaal and in abundance.\"\n2. As for the second part of the question for your husband to praise Allah\nwhen he hears that the enemy is being defeated is permissable in Islam. As\nwe do make Du'aa for them to see the light of Islam but if they fight\nagainst the Muslims, then we must make Du'aa for their destruction. Remember\nit is Allah that will destroy them. Also, in Islam we have the right to\ndefend our land and the like but most important to defend the Deen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nShaykh Irshaad Amod\nfor: FATWA DEPT."
