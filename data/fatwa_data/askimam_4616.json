  "question": "Does performing Haj for a deceased person who did not perform Haj nor request or specify in his will, discharge the murhoom's fard obligation or does he get the reward of nafl Haj?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nInsha-allah my husband and I intend going for Haj this year(2002). Since I have performed my Fard Haj already I intend performing Haj for my father-in-law who did not perform Haj in his lifetime. Firstly, can this Haj be called Haj-e-badl if he did not set aside money or request in his will for anyone to perform Haj for him? Secondly, will his Fard obligation be discharged or will he receive reward of nafl Haj if he did not specify in his will? Kindly reply soon, Insha-allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf Hajj was Fardh upon your father-in-law, and he did not perform Hajj\nduring his lifetime, he ought to have made a bequest of Hajj-e-Badal.\n\nSince he did not make a bequest, and you voluntarily make Hajj-e-Badal on\nhis behalf, it is hoped that Allah Ta'ala will accept it on his behalf,\nInsha Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
