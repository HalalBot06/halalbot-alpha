  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, if a Muslim country is attacked, they have a right to defend\nthemselves and declare Jihaad. Jihad will be Fardh-e-Ayn upon the males of\nthat area (in this instance, Afghanistan).\n\nIf they are unable to defend themselves, then the obligations extends to\nthose closest to them, Pakistan. Thereafter, the obligation will extend\naccordingly.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
