  "question": "Comments on zina and adulterous acts. do we still receive this punishment of lashes for fornication and stone death for committing adultery or will this be forgiven?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMajor sins have major consequences, but if we sincerely ask forgiveness and Inshallah Allah will forgive us, do we still receive this punishment of lashes for fornication and stone death for committing adultery or will this be forgiven? Or should we go and receive our punishment from the ulama? Does this acts need to be told to the wife/husband so they can forgive us or is it better to conceal sin and just keep practice good deeds and refrain from those acts. Is there something we can read or give certain amount to charity to pay for these acts? Jazakallah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf one committed the crime of adultery, he%2Fshe does not have to mention that to anyone or go to receive punishment. Such a person must repent to Allah Ta?ala for the sin.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah is Most Gracious and Most Merciful. He says in the Noble Qur'aan, 'Oh My Slaves! Do not despair. Verily Allah will forgive all sins.' %0D%0A%0D%0AIn one Hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, 'If a person has sins equivalent to the foams of the sea and pebbles on a desert, Allah's mercy is so encompassing that He will forgive every sin.' In another narration, it is mentioned that Allah will speak secretly to one of His slaves on the day of Qiyaamat and remind him of all his sins. After the person will confess his sins, Allah will say to him, 'I concealed your faults in the world, today too, I will conceal your faults. Go in Jannah, I have forgiven you.' %0D%0A%0D%0AThe above mentioned are few of many Ahaadith explaining the extent of Allah's Mercy. However, Allah says, 'Verily Allah will not forgive a person who ascribe partners (commit Shirk) with Him.' The only sin that is unforgivable is Kufr (disbelief) and Shirk (ascribing partners). Accepting Islam is the only atonement for the sin of Kufr and Shirk. %0D%0A%0D%0AIf one fulfils the conditions of repentance, i.e. regret and make firm intention to reform, then surely Allah Ta'ala is Tawwaab (Most Forgiving)%0D%0A%0D%0AYou should renew your Tawbah and again make a firm intention never to repeat the sin"
