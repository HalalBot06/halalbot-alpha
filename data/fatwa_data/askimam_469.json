  "question": "Underinvoicing to pay lesser government duty",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am an importer of goods and have always been honest in paying my government duties. I have noticed that importers request their suppliers to under-invoice the consignment in order to pay a lesser amount in government duty.By me importing goods the proper way, I will be more expensive and will not be competitive in the market. Is it permissible for me to under invoice the consignment in order to be competitive in the market?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nEvery person who resides in a country or acquires its citizenship and\nenters into an agreement with that government should follow the laws of that\nland, therefore, he is under obligation to follow the laws unless a law of\nthe land that compells him to do an act which is prohibited in Shariah. On\nthe basis of this principle, since smuggling is illegal, a Muslim is\nrequired to abide by this restriction. (Justice Mufti Taqi Usmani, Pakistan)\n\nFrom Al Mahmood 10"
