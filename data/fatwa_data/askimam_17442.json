  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalaamu alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nMy mother passed away last month, she was a religious and very humble woman.\nEvery one who ever meets her admires her due to her nice behaviour.\nBefore her death she was reciting Yasseen Sharif from holy Quran.\nAt the time of her death she had a deep breath and a tear slips from her right eye.\nI would like to know about the significance of this tear, if any?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAnything that refers to Ilmul Gaib (knowledge of unseen) is best known to Allah alone. \n\nThe slipping of the tear also falls in that category. However, the fact that your mother was praised by many people for her good character, she was holding the Quran and even reciting Sura Yaseen and passed away in that condition is a clear sign of her  leaving the world with strong Ieman and good deeds which will be a means for her salvation in the hereafter. May Allah elevate the state of your mother, Aameen.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
