  "question": "I live in US ,Is it permissible to buy Indian Products which have thier idols printed on the bag",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy roommate muslim friend say that it is thier product trade mark so its permissible and its unnecessary hardship to look for other brands without such pictures printed on them , i say they have printed it because they think it will bring barakah in their sales and so we should not buy such product if other brands are available without the printed idols. Is this a Fiqh issue , is difference of opinion allowed in this matter .\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs Muslims believing in the oneness of Allah Ta'ala (Tawheed), we should be\nsensitive to our belief and distance ourselves from anything against\nTawheed.\n\nThe Qur'aan condemns idols and idol worship. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) removed the idols that were in the Baytullah. Hadhrat Eesa\n(Alayhis salaam) will break the cross upon his return to earth as that\nrepresents a belief of Shirk. Therefore, it is not permissible to purchase\nIndian products having idols imprinted on them if an alternative is\navailable.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
