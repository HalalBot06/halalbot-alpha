  "question": "Can we just practice on the Matn of the Hadith?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\na)My question to respected Mufti Saheb is that we find different kind of hadith categories like Saheeh or Dhaeef etc apart from fabricated hadith, My question is instead of worrying about the isnad of the hadith can we not practise open the matn(test) of the hadith because the matn is actually what is to be conveyed .Pls clarify\n\n\nb) I want to know if Muftii Saheb has written any books in English which are available in the market .Pls mention the names of the books.\n\n\nc) Can we do tasbeeh on both the hands after Salah instead of only using the right hand is it OK ? Pls clarify\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1. The safeguard for the authenticity of ahadith is isnaad. If the formalities of isnaad are not carried out in hadith, then anyone will say anything and attribute it to hadith. It is true that the core of the ahadith is the matn. Isnad means to ensure that the matn is indeed a hadith. It should also be understood that the muhadditheen have already dealt extensively with sifting out authentic ahadith from fabricated “ahadith”. Many books are compiled in that regard.\n\nThis however does not mean that one can practice on every sahih hadith especially pertaining to ahkaam. There are many sahih ahadith that are not mamool biha (practiced upon) by adherents of different madhabs. This is due to the concept of taqleed and following the guidance of the Imams of the madhabs who were oceans of knowledge. They understood the sciences of ahadith and its various intricate angles. Such knowledge is beyond the understanding of others. It is therefore compulsory to place our trust on the deductions of the imams of the madhabs and follow one particular imam and his madhab.\n\n2. At present, the Al-Mahmood is published and is available in . It is a compilation of various fatawa. The different monthly editions of the Al-Mahmood can be viewed on the site daruliftaa.net.\n\n3. One may use both hands for tasbih.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
