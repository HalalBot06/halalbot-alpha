  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nCONTRACEPTION %0D%0A%0D%0AReversible %0D%0AChemical - the pill which is taken orally spermicidal jellies used locally. Mechanical - use of condom intra-uterine device Physical - coitus interruptus rhythm method Permanent - sterilization operation - tubal ligations - vasectomies. %0D%0A%0D%0AQuestion 1 %0D%0AIs the Practice of contraception allowed in Islam? If so, under what circumstances? %0D%0A%0D%0AAnswer %0D%0AContraception is permissible on a limited scale for valid reasons - reasons considered by the Shari%E1h to be valid. The circumstances which will permit reversible and permanent contraception differ. %0D%0A%0D%0AREVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTION %0D%0AAmong the reasons accepted by the Shari%E1h as valid for practising reversible contraception are: %0D%0A(A) Physical weakness. %0D%0A(B) Sickness. %0D%0A(C) The wife maintaining her beauty or figure for the sake of her husband. %0D%0A(D) The couple being on a journey or in a distant land. %0D%0A(E) Adverse political conditions, e.g. children are forcibly separated from their parents as is advocated by communism; etc. %0D%0A(F) The couple decide to separate in the near future. %0D%0A(G) The wife is an immoral person. %0D%0A%0D%0AThere are valid grounds for practising reversible contraception. Poverty or the fear of poverty are not valid reasons for contraception. It is not permissible to practice contraception on account of a fear of not being able to provide for a large family. Such a fear is an attribute of non-Muslims. According to the Qur%E3n Shareef: 'There is not a living creature, but its sustenance is the responsibility of Allah.' %0D%0A%0D%0ASimilarly desire to curb sexual desire which may stem out of piety is not a lawful ground for contraception. If practised for any reason which is unlawful in Islam, then contraception will likewise be unlawful, e.g. for indulgence in illicit sex. %0D%0A%0D%0APERMANENT CONTRACEPTION %0D%0APermanent contraception is permissible only if the woman's life is in danger or her health is seriously threatened.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
