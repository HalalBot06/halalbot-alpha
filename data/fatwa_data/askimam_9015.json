  "question": "Is it true that Imam Husain had 64 wives?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalaam u alykum, My dad told us dad imam husain had 64 wives! I just cant believe this as this is something forbidden and how can Imam husain do such a thing? We told dad that he must be mistaken but he said no he will prove with some books. I Wanted to know that is this true? Jazakallahu khairun\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta?ala has permitted males to have only four wives at once in marriage. It is not possible that Hadhrat Husayn (Radhiallaahu Anhu) had 64 wives at once in his marriage.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
