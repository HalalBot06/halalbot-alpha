  "question": "I have a relative ( my mother's sister's husband) , he visits my home, he is not good in his characters ( may ALLAH forgive me for saying this),",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI told my wife not to come in front of us when, but she always comes, after i scolded her several times she stopped it, but still she comes and says salaam and goes from our sittings. Even though i told my wife several times not to come but she is not listening to me, I think he visited my house in my absence and talked or made love with my wife (it might be my just doubt), becoz when my wife is not in my home he never comes to my house, please help me that how should i convence my wife for this.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFirst and foremost, don?t doubt the chastity of your wife on such trivial grounds. Don?t let Shataan instil such thoughts into your mind.\n\nIn a very polite and affectionate manner, explain to your wife what you require of her. Avoid scolding her as this may make her more rebellious. Also ask your uncle to visit only when you are around. Give him a time perhaps.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nchecked & approved by: mUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
