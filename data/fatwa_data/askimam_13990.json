  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nwhat is adab-e-gasht??what should we talk while giving adab-e-gasht?please reply in details?what are the adabs?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe word Adaab means etiquette. Thus, Adab-e-Ghust would mean etiquettes of carrying out the Ghust. This term comprises of two components. The first being the Targheeb (encouragement talk) and the second being the directives of how to carry out the actual Ghust correctly. With regard to the first part, encouragement should be given as to how the Prophets and Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhum] sacrificed their lives to ensure that Deen prevails on earth and all falsehood be removed. Therefore, the talk should be given as to how we can also achieve this same concern which the Prophet (alayhimus salaam) also had. With regard to the second part, i.e. the etiquette, this comprises of the directives given in the Qur’aan, Hadith and pious elders as to how to leave the Musjid, how to interact with others especially when visiting them at their homes, etiquettes of travel, etc.\n\nAll these directives and others make up Adaab-e-Ghust.\n\nEtiquettes in Brief\n\nGroups will be formed comprising of 3-10 persons. 3 people will be specifically appointed and given extra responsibilities. The first being the Ameer who will ensure that the groups, going out for Ghust. Leave the Musjid with due consideration to the etiquettes. The Jamaat should gather and make a du’aa outside the Musjid. They should walk on the right hand side of the pathway there keeping the gaze lowered from all Haraam, especially women. The Jamaat should walk together. If travelling by car, the appropriate du’aas should be recited when embarking and disembarking.\n\nThe second person is the Mutakallim. He is the spokesperson of the Jamaat. His speech should be addressed to the entire Jamaat and not specifically focussing at the person who is being visited. His talk should be centred around our short stay in this world, everlasting life of the hereafter and our desperate preparation towards it. The third being the guide. He will show the Jamaat the Muslim homes, inform them of the name of the brother and his occupation and never to expose any fault of his to the group. He will knock at the door, not to look inside at anytime. He will request to see the menfolk of the house.\n\nOne or two persons will be chosen exclusively to remain in the Musjid for making Dhikr and du’aa. This group is regarded as the powerhouse of the Ghust Jamaat, i.e. imploring Allah for divine help in assisting those out for the Ghust.\n\nNb. These are just the general etiquettes. However, these may change according to time, place and situation. It is, therefore, advised that you find out more about the finer details from one of the local persons in your area who is acquainted with these etiquettes and principles. Remember, by you physically doing the Ghust, you will learn and understand these etiquettes as compared to just theoretically memorising it.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
