  "question": "Before the Nikah Can the family from my spouse side demand of me not getting married second time.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaykum , my brother just got married second time from pak with an Alimma, my wedding is due in few months and the family from my spouse side is afraid of that I might do the same and they did asked me for an promise of not getting married second time, in response I said I will not do this promise, as because Islam has given permission. Question 1 Can the family from my spouse side demand this of me not getting married second time. Question 2 we got engaged nearly four years ago and would like to know if the Nikah is vaild? When (last week) I was ask from my spouse side in fornt of Six Baaligh (mature) withere I would marry her, in response I said Yes! I would like to. Same question was then asked from my spouse, in reply she said, there is no choise, she was asked again few times to say Yes or No and replied as saying Yes. Question 3. If the Nikah is vaild in Q2. parents were not present from both side, is it ok if they ask to do Khutbah for Nikah, if Yes then will there be same question asked again from both of us (e.g. will you marry me). Jazaka? Allah rember us in your duaas.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Shari?ah has permitted a Muslim male to have four wives at once. If your future in-laws want you give them a promise that you will not remarry, then that is your prerogative. You can give them a promise and then it is your moral responsibility to keep up to that.\n\n2. The nikah is not valid because the ?future tense? was used ?would marry?. Past tense has to be used in nikah as ?do you marry her? or do you accept her as your wife? and the reply should also be in past tence.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
