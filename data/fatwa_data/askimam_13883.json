  "answer": "QUESTION\nTalaaq-Raj'ee. What happens if the Husband does not take the wife back after iddat ?\n\nCan he re-marry her after that ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf a man issues one or two Rajâ€™ee Talaaqs to his wife, he may take her back within the iddah period without a new Nikah. However, once the iddah period expires, the Nikah completely terminates. He may now only take her back after a new Nikah. Mahr (dowry) will have to be paid again. (Raddul Muhtaar vol.3 pg.404)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
