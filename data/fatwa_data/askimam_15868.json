You had taken a false oath for which you have to repent. Beg forgiveness from Allah and surely he will forgive you. There is no need to become despondent. The concern in your heart for the sin you have committed is a sign of true Imaan and faith in your heart.\n\nContinue to do good deeds and good deeds repels evil deeds. Be punctual upon your Salaah and reserve some time everyday for Zikr and Tilaawat (recitation) of the Quraan e Kareem. This will strengthen your Imaan and wipe away all the sins and mistakes you have committed.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
