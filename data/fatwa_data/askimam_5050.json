  "question": "polycystic ovarian syndrome",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nassalaamualaikum wrwb. i'm an unmarried lady with polycystic ovarian syndrome. i wish to get married but i have some reservations due to my illness. i have irreversible symptoms such as facial and body hairiness (on my abdomen and bosom and other parts of body) and also, parts of my skin r much darker and they look as if they have not been cleaned thoroughly. because of these symptoms, i feel unattractive and am very apprehensive about intimate marital relations, if Allah Does match me with a life partner. Another matter is that i've been told by doctors that it might be very difficult for me to conceive, and i may need fertility treatments. i've thought it over very carefully and i believe that Allah will make me a mother if He Decrees so, with or without fertility treatment. this means i've chosen not to go for such treatments. my question is should there be a marriage proposal, should i be frank about my illness and its symptoms? and about my decision not to go for fertility treatment? thank u so much for your attention to my query. May Allah Bless and Protect all our Muslim brothers and sisters in every corner of earth. Ameen. Wassalaam.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nInstead of feeling negative about yourself, focus on the positive side of\nyourself.\n\nIf a suitable match does present itself, be frank about your illness, etc.\nIt is better to be clear and frank now instead of regretting later on.\nContinue making Du'aa as well. May Allah Ta'ala grant you a good match with\na man that would keep you eternally happy and may He bless you with pious\nand healthy children.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\n\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
