Jazakalah khairan\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ: What does the Shariáh say with regard to dying hair? Is it permissible to\ndye one's hair?\nA: Pure black dye is not permissible. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi\nWasallam) said, \"There will be people who will come later (in my Ummah) and\napply black dye. They will not even smell the fragrance of paradise.\" (Abu\nDaawood). However, it is permissible for a Mujaahid (warrior) to apply black\ndye in order to give the impression of being young. (Jawahirul Fiqh vol2\npg421)\nTo dye the hair any other colour besides black e.g. Mehndi or Katm (type of\ngrass) is permissible. This was the practice of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu\nÁlayhi Wasallam) and the Sahaaba (Radhiyallaahu Ánhum). (Jawahirul Fiqh vol2\npg421)\nAl-Mahmood Vol.1 pg.22\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
