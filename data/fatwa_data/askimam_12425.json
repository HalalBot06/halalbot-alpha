  "question": "Is this allowed to adopt a method of Ibadat, not proven by Quran and Sunnah...Making zikr by method prescribed by Sufis.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs this allowed to adopt a method of Ibadat, not proven by Quarn and Sunnah, Say for example, If you do a Ibadat which is permitted, but you fix it with some specific time, place, number or method, for example. 1. Using traditional tasbeeh for counting zikr. 2. Making zikr by method prescribed by Sufis. As they recite Kalima Tayyibah by moving their head in a particular manner. 3. Fixing amount of zikr and firmly following it irrespectively of any circumstances as if this is fard. 4. Making congregation Dua after every fard salat. My question is not regarding its benefit, as one can insists that these manners are beneficial for achieving Ikhalas, Ihsaan and Tazkiyan. But question is, are these methods of Ibadat acceptable or not.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is no prohibition to the queried actions, hence, Shari?ah will consider them to be Mubaah.\n\nThe principle of Mubaah is that it is permissible to act upon it unless it is not considered necessary in the Shari?ah. Once a Mubaah act is considered as necessary and part of Deen, it will be Bid?at.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
