  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it true that the Prophet (saw) had destroyed all idols and paintings, EXCEPT for those that pertained to Prophet Isa and Mariam (peace be upon them)?\n\nI have read that when the Prophet (saw) had finally made his move in taking over Mecca as it leader, one of his first actions was to destroy the idols in the House of God. If the above is true, could you please refer me to an original source/text that describes these events? Any other recommedations of excellent books on the biography of the Prophet (saw) that are in English would be appreciated.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nNabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] marched against the Makkans after their break of the treaty of Hudaybiyah. The day the Muslims were blessed with victory is known as ‘Yawmul Fath’. On this day, the Ka’abah returned to its original form, free from the pollution of the pagans (polytheists). Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] saw to the destruction and removal of all the paintings and statues.\n\nIbn Abbaas [radhiallaahu anhu] narrates that Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] entered the house (Ka’bah) wherein he found the picture of Maryam and Ibraaheem (alayhimus salaam). Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] thereafter mentioned, ‘As for them, they had heard that the Angels do not enter a house contain pictures.’ (Bukhari vol.4 Hadith3351)\n\nThe above contains some important points:\n\n1. Ibraahim (alayhimus salaam)and Maryam (alayhimus salaam)knew that picture making is forbidden.\n\n2. Angels do not enter a house containing pictures;\n\n3. Ibraahim (alayhimus salaam)and Maryam (alayhimus salaam)are not responsible for the pictures made of them.\n\nIn another narration, ibn Abbaas [radhiallaahu anhu] narrates, ‘When Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] saw pictures (idols) in the Ka’bah, he did not enter till he gave a decree for their destruction. Thereafter, they were erased and Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] saw Ibraahim and Ismail (alayhimus salaam) within divining arrows in their hands. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘May Allah destroy them, I take an oath on Allah that they (Ibraahim and Ismail (alayhimus salaam)never predicted the future with diving arrows.’ (Ibid)\n\nIn another Hadith, Jaabir (alayhimus salaam) mentions that there were pictures in the Ka’bah. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] commanded Umar [radhiallaahu anhu] to erase them. Umar (alayhimus salaam)went with a cloth and erased them with the cloth. Nabi (alayhimus salaam)entered the Ka’bah and there were no pictures remaining. (Musnad Ahmad vol.3 Hadith396)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
