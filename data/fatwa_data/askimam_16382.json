This is tawfeeq from Allah Taala which is a great bounty upon you. May Allah Taala keep you steadfast and grant you the strength and ability to continue with His worship till death, Aameen.\n\nIn the material world, when one expects to earn something, he works tirelessly towards that. He does not give up in spite of his many failures. As believers, we believe in the eternal life after death and Jannah. Allah has promised great rewards for His obedient slaves. Allah also warned of His severe punishments in Jahannam.\n\nA believer should always focus in his success in the eternal life and strive towards that. When one focuses on the pleasure of Allah, no task is difficult. When one expects millions of dollars in this world, it is not difficult for him to sacrifice his sleep, comfort and luxuries. Ponder upon the infinite bounties of Allah in the hereafter. It will be easy to sacrifice our luxuries and comforts for eternal success and prosperity.\n\nAt the background of the above, you should have the courage to make up for your previous years of missed fardh salats from the time you became baligh (physically matured). That is generally around the age of fifteen. Therefore, you will have to make up for approximately fifteen years of farz and witr salats. An easy way of doing that is perform at least one missed fardh salat with each of the present fardh salat and witr salat. Inshallah, in fifteen years time, you would cover up all your missed salats. If you have more time, you could increase performing your missed salats. If you die while making up for your past, Inshallah, Allah will forgive you. You should also make wasiyyat (bequest) to pay fidya for each missed farz and witr salat if you did not make qaza. The amount payable for each missed farz and witr salat is the amount of sadaqatul-Fitr. You cannot deliberately leave out the Qadha Salaat and chose to pay fidya instead. Fidya is only if by chance you were unable to make Qadha as in a life and death situation.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
