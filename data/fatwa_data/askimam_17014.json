  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nYour fatwa no. 5848 – a glorifying eulogy to Muhammad ibn Abdal Wahab\nmentions the views as held by the said individual. The following passage\nis of particular interest:\n“The Shaikh explained his views in regard to intercession and made it\nclear that he believed in the intercession of the Holy Prophet on the Day\nof Resurrection. Authentic books, such as 'Al-Tawassul wal-Wasila' by\nIbn-Taimiya and 'Ad-Dur an-Nadir'by Imaam Shawkaani, were also cited by\nhim. He finally quoted the Qur'anic verse: \"... Those whom you call on,\nthemselves desire nearness to Allah, which of them shall be nearer to\nAllah.? He further explained the Qur'anic injunctions in which Allah says\nthat all intercessions belonged to Him and He alone will grant permission\nfor intercessions. The Holy Prophet was granted the right to intercede.\nThe chapter on intercession in his \"Kitab at-Tawhid' is quite elaborate.\nIbn-Taimiya had divided intercession into six categories. The Shaikh also\ndiscussed the visit to the graves in the light of Ahadith. Ibn-Qayyim made\nan express statement in the following words: \"Among evil practices are\nusing them (tombs) as religious festivals, performing prayers in them,\nwalking round them, kissing them and touching them, rubbing the face\nagainst the dust, worshipping persons buried in them, making supplication\nto them and calling on them for sustenance, health, repayment of debts,\nalleviation of distress, aid to the needy, and other things such as\nidolaters used to ask their idols\"\n1. What were his views regarding ‘Wasilla’ through an individual who has\npassed away?\n2. Present-day salafis object to the common Muslim facing the grave of\nRasulullah [saw] and making dua [they seemingly tire, yet this practice is\nemphatically ceaseless]. Is it permissible to face the grave of Rasulullah\nand make dua?\n3. The article, with reference to graves, also points out the evil\npractices such as “kissing them and touching them, rubbing the face\nagainst the dust…” Is this not in contradiction to the famous and\nreverenced Qasida Burda Shareef wherein Imam Buseeri [ra] expreeses the\ndesire to the rub and kiss the dust of the Prophet’s [saw] grave?\n4. Does the Qur’aanic verse quoted in the passage above ‘those whom you\ncall on…’ refer to asking through the Wasilla of Nabi [saw], since the\ncontext of the discussion above is regarding the Wasilla of Nabi [saw]?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1.      We are not aware of what his personal beliefs were regarding Wasila through an individual who has passed away.\n\n2.      It is permissible to face the grave of Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم and make Du‘ā.\n\n \n\n·         ثم تصلي عليه و تدعو بما شئت عند وجهه الكريم مستدبر القبلة (نور الإيضاح 192 , قديمي)\n\n \n\n·         ثم يعود ويقف عند رأس سيدنا النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم الشريف مستقبله كالأول ويقول اللهم إنك قلت وقولك الحق ولو أنهم إذ ظلموا أنفسهم جاءوك فاستغفروا الله واستغفر لهم الرسول لوجدوا الله توابا رحيما وقد جئناك سامعين قولك طائعين أمرك مستشفعين بنبيك إليك اللهم ربنا اغفر لنا ولآباءنا وأمهاتنا واخواننا الذين سبقونا بالإيمان ولا تجعل في قلوبنا غلا للذين آمنوا ربا إنك رؤوف رحيم ربنا آتنا في الدنيا حسنة وفي الآخرة حسنة وقنا عذاب النار سبحان ربك رب العزة عما يصفون وسلام على المرسلين والحمد لله رب العالمين ويزيد ما شاء ويدعو بما حضره ويوفق له بفضل الله تعالى (نور الإيضاح 194 , قديمي)\n\n \n\n3.       It is disliked (Makrūh) to touch, kiss and rub one’s face on a grave. Furthermore, such actions are contrary to the grace and respect of a believer. Imam Buseeri’s couplets should be understood in the context of poetry. It is befitting to mention such words and describe such actions in a poem in honor and love of Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم . However, in practical terms, it will not be a show of respect and honor. Respect and honor would be to conduct oneself with humility, dignity and composure whilst one is standing before Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم .\n\n \n\n·         ولا يمسح القبر ولا يقبله ولا يمسه فإن ذلك من عادة النصارى كذا في شرح الشرعة (الطحطاوي 621 دار الكتب العلمية) \n\n·         ثم توجه مع رعاية غاية الأدب فقام تجاه الوجه الشريف متواضعا خاشعا مع الذلة و الانكسار و الخشية و الوقار و الهيبة و الافتقار غاض الطرف مكفوف الجوارح فارغ القلب (لباب المناسك 508 , إدارة القران )\n\n4.      The mentioned Ayah does not refer to asking through the Wasila of Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم .  \n\n \n\nNote: Mufti Ebrahim Desai and the ‘Ulamā affiliated with Ask-Imam do not agree with the views mentioned in the article, the views of Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab or the views of the current day Wahhabis wherein they differ with the Aqā’id and practices of the ‘Ulamā of Deoband and the remainder of the Ahl al-Sunnah. It is unknown how such a response was originally placed on this website. Kindly note that this serves as a clear and lucid renunciation from the aforementioned article.\n\n \nAnd Allah knows best\nWassalam\n\nMl.
