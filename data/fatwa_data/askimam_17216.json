  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a question, If i see someone praying salat without a topi is it a correct procedure to put topi on his head or put a topi near him ?\nas i have seen that some people put topi on the head of the person who is in salat without a topi.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe ruling depends on who the person is. If he does not mind putting a topi on his head, then one may put a topi on such a person’s head. If he will mind, and placing a topi will cause a problem, then a topi should not be places on such a person’s head.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\nWassalam\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
