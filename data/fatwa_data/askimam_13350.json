  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni was in pressure from my parents and my wife parents. we married without their permission.i told my wife to talk to her parents that we want to do the whole wedding ceremony but they wont agree they said if she wants to come home she will bring the divorce paper. i didnt wanted to do that i wanted her to go so everything would be fine but it didnt go as i planned. anyway i went to go get the divorce paper in the office when i was leaving with the papers the guy said i have to sign first. so i did but i signed the papers so i could take them home. i wasnt signing as i was giving her divorce. i gave these papers to her dad there was mufti sahab there also. he read the papers and told my friends to sign as witness but he didnt tell me to say talaq 3 times to my wife. but the witness didnt read the paper. but before all of this i told my wife main tumhe talalq deta hoon 2 times in these words when i was angry at her. so i dont know if we r divorced.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf you told your wife two times, ‘I am divorcing you’ and then you signed the divorce paper, then that is the third divorce. Your Nikah has completely broken down.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
