Once you have made Tawbah, you need to start your journey on self\nreformation. This self reformation in the shape of your daily Salaats,\nrecitation of the Qur'aan and the like will open the doors for a better\nfuture. Then, once this is achieved, you need to inform your parents before\nthey hear it from someone else would lead to more serious trouble.\n\nBy this time, your friend would have received the message that you do not\nwant anything to do with him and he cannot inform your parents because they\nare already aware of the problem. As for marriage, with sincere Tawbah and\nchange in life style and continuous Du'aa, Allah Ta'ala will make it easy\nfor you to marry someone that will respect you and not hold it for you that\nyou have had somebody else. But this can only happen if you can see a change\nin your life.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n<"
