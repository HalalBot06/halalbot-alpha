  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Mufti Sahab As-salamualaikum. I am planning to get married to a girl whose father is working in a bank which bank deals with interest. But, the family itself is very much into religion and the parents of the bride are practicing muslim and the bride also is a practicing muslimah. They practice hijab and follow all other religious obligations. Then, is it that for the income of her father, is it prohobited in Islam to get married to her. As a spouse she should be quite compatible with me Inshallah and I did isthikhara which was positive as well. May allah give you reward.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible to marry a woman whose father is a banker. The daughter\ncannot be held responsible for her father's actions. Each person is judged\nfor his/her own deeds.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
