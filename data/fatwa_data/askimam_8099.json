What are the duties of brothers in America regarding the captive mujahideen at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba? 5. Can you give a ruling on etiquettes of jihad (warfare in the way of Allah SWT)?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. As long as the animal is slaughtered in accordance to Shari?ah, it will be Halaal. However, a person is bound to follow the rules and regulations of his country. Violating the laws of the country will lead a person to embarrassment and disgrace which is prohibited in the Hadith of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). However, the repercussions of this prohibition will not affect the actual meat itself. The meat will, therefore, be Halaal.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Hadhrat Hurayth (Radhiallaahu Anhu) says that he saw Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) seated on the pulpit. He was wearing a black turban with both ends hanging between his shoulders. (Muslim vol.1 pg.440)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. The socks do not have to be washed.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. We are unaware of the exact situation and conditions in Cuba, hence, we cannot comment.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Your question is ambiguous. What exactly do you want to know? Jihaad is very vast and it entails many aspects. The etiquettes of every aspect are different. Please be more specific.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
