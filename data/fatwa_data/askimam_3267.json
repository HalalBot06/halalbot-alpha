  "question": "Can you tell me what is the shariah position on the bringing of small (under 7) children in the mosque. Especially when the Mosque does not cater for women.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nChildren in the Mosque%0D%0A%0D%0AChildren who do not know ettiquettes of the Masjid and have no knowledge of%0D%0Aritual cleanliness should NOT be allowed to come to the Masjid. Similarly,%0D%0Achildren who know ritual cleanliness and also know the sanctity and%0D%0Areverence of the Masjid are permitted to come to the Masjid.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'When the child is%0D%0Aseven years old, order him to say prayers and when he is ten years old,%0D%0ACHASTISE HIM TO DO SO.' (Mishkaat). It does not mean that when the child is%0D%0Aseven years old, he can pay due respect to the Masjid. The instruction and%0D%0Atraining for prayer can also be given at home. When a child has attained%0D%0Aseven years of age and he can show respect to the Masjid and understand%0D%0Aritual cleanliness, he is permitted to come to the Masjid. There is no%0D%0Aprohibition for such a child.%0D%0A%0D%0ARASULULLAH (SALLALLAAHU ALAYHI WASALLAM) SAID, 'KEEP YOUR INSANE PEOPLE AND%0D%0AYOUR CHILDREN AWAY FROM THE MASJID' (IBN MAAJAH). This prohibition is%0D%0Agenerally flouted nowadays where little children create disturbance in the%0D%0Amasjid. Often it has been experienced that little children by their crying%0D%0Adistract the father and other Musallees as well. The prohibition is based on%0D%0Athe sanctity, reverence and cleanliness of the masjid. It is also improper%0D%0Ato bring little children into the Saffs (rows) of adults.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
