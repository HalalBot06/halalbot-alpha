  "question": "1) I was told by someone thatâ€™s covering the face with veil is not a fardh, b) I intend to send my son to Madrassa Inamiyyah What is the minimum age to enrol in the hafiz course?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) I was told by someone that?s covering the face with veil is not a fardh; it?s a favourable action during this time. Does this mean OK not to use veil but covering the satr completely infront of my closest family members (i.e brother in-laws)? 2) I am following Shafiee mazhab: Do I have to pay dum when the veil (which is not touching the face as I?ll use it with the cap) touch my face because of the wind? Is it ok to pray/salat with the veil on ? 3) I intend to send my son to Madrassa Inamaiyyah to be a hafiz however I am not sure I have enough fund for him. Is it possible for me to ask for the scholarship and based on what extent?What is the minimum age to enrol in the hafiz course?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Covering the face is as important and necessary as the rest of the body.\nThe face is the focal point of attraction. So, when the rest of the body is\nto be covered, obviously the focal point, the face, needs to be covered as\nwell.\n2. Damm is not necessary in this case. You may offer your Salaat with the\nveil.\n3. The minimum age requirement is twelve. The Madrasah will pay the fees on\nhis behalf for meals, boarding and education. Travel and related costs will\nhave to be borne by the student.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
