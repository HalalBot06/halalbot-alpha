  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nOne of my relative's dad has passed away around 1 year back. (Please do make dua for his and all momins makfirat). My relative desired to build some kind of permanent structure around his Kabr or alteast keep a stone near the Kabr.\n\nI wanted to know from you whether Shariah allows such things and is permissible ? If yes is there some kind of restrictions which is applied as regards to structure itself or color of stone not to be black etc ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nJaabir [radhiallaahu anhu] narrates that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] prohibited from decorating graves and building on graves. (Mishkaat pg.148)\n\nIn view of the above quoted Hadith, your understanding is correct. It is not permissible to put up any structure on the grave. The only leeway is to have a marker like a head side stone to indicate the name of the deceased person. That is only to remember the place of the grave of the person.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
