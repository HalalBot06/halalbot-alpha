  "question": "can women go for work?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nsheikh, can women go for work? If so,then under which circumstances and how?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is important to understand that Allah has created different creations for different reasons. If those creations fulfil the reasons for their creation, life will function smoothly. However, if these creations involve themselves in other duties for which they were not created, life will become chaotic and stressful.\n\nThe primary duty of a woman is to tend to domestic related work. Apart from nurturing her children and taking care of their well being, serving her husband, father etc. a woman has no other responsibility. It is the responsibility of her father, husband, brother, etc. to support her.\n\nIt is unfortunate nowadays that a woman who fulfils this responsibility is classed as backward and slow. On the other hand if a woman goes out to earn and has degrees before her name, she is considered to be advanced and educated. Rasulullah () states that Allah curses that woman who leaves her home without a valid excuse and other men are attracted to her.\n\nDue to the high standard of living a single income is not sufficient. The demands of the family exceed the income thus forcing the wife to earn and increase the income of the home. The harms this dual income philosophy has created in society will never be comprehended. Secular governments have initiated campaigns to drive women back into their homes to fulfil their original responsibility that Allah had created them for. They observed that households whose both parents were working, their children who were taken care off by strangers and day care centres became the monsters and gangsters of tomorrow. They have destroyed the fibre of social fabric and very less will remain for them to live upon.\n\nAccording to Shariah, it is not permissible for a woman to leave her home except in dire need and necessity. The only exclusion to work is for that woman who has no relatives to support her and she is forced to seek a livelihood that is sufficient for her to live upon.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
