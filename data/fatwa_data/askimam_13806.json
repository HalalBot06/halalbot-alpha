  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy question is relating to fasting in the month of Ramadan and breaking a fast on purpose.\n \nThe story is, when I was in my secondary education, at the age of either 12,13 or 14, but NOT 15, me and this other Muslim broke our fast. We had no reason whatsoever, we didn’t know the rulings.  Obviously I repented and inshallah Allah has forgiven me but it’s just something that will haunt me and I still ask Allah to forgive what I did.\nFor the past 3 Ramadans, the breaking of the fast has been haunting me, something that will probably haunt me till I clear this problem. To do that, I have decide to ask you. \nSo, do I have to make kaffarah? If yes, is it fasting for 60 days consecutively.\nPS To be on the safe side, I am on the opinion that it was my fault and I have to pay expiation so I believe it is Kafarah - 60 days of fasting consecutively. Currently, I'm doing the kaffarah and so far, I have fasted 28 days and I have no sign of weakness in me, infact the ramadhan that just went by, I found it to be the easiest.\n \nMay peace be upon you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn principle, if you were physically matured at the time you broke your fast, then only Kaffaarah and Qadhaa will have to be offered. That is 61 fasts. If you were not physically mature, then you do not have offer Qadhaa or Kaffaarah as you were a minor in terms of the Shari’ah at that time.\n\nIt is good to clear your conscious and continue the fasts until you finish 60 fasts consecutively. You may keep the one Qadhaa jointly or separately.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
