  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn the Zuhr prayer, the imam recites in a low, inaudible voice. What are the rulings for those following the imam?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nWhen offering a silent prayer (such as Zuhr and Asr) behind an imam, the muqtadi (the one following the imam) should say the Takbir Tahrima (Allahu Akbar) immediately after the imam says it and recite the Thanaa’ (Subhaanakallaahumma wa bihamdika…). Thereafter, he should stand silently until the imam goes into Ruku’. He should not recite anything else in the standing posture behind the imam such as: Ta’awwuz (A’uzu billaahi…), Tasmiya (Bismillahi …), Surah Fatiha and other Surahs. A muqtadi (the one following the imam) should recite the Takbirs (Allahu Akbar) when going to the different postures, the Tasbih of Ruku’ (Subhana Rabbiyal Azeem) and Sujood (Subhana Rabbiyal A’laa), Tashahhud (Attahiyaatu lillaahi…), Darood (Allaahumma Salli Alaa…), dua after Darood (Rabbanaa Aatinaa…),  Salaam etc. However, when the Imam says the Tasmee’ (Samiallaahu liman hamidah), he should say the Tahmeed (Rabbana lakal hamd) instead.\n\n \n\nThe same rules apply when offering a loud prayer (such as Fajr, Maghrib and Isha) behind an imam.\n\n \n(Raddul Muhtaar: vol. 1 pg. 489-490, 497,545, Saeed)\n(Maraaqil Falaah: pg. 125-128, Dar Quba)\n \n \nAnd Allah knows best.\n \nMl.
