  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Is it a bidat to open lights at maghrib time? 2.should i pray allah to have me married as soon as possible or how should i do dua? i am also thinking about going to alimah school what should i do? do dua for marriage or alimah course? kazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) What do you mean by opening lights at Maghrib time? Is it a custom and do\npeople regard that as compulsory?\n2) We advise you make Mashwara (consult) and Istikhaara (seek Divine\nguidance - attached) in making a decision. With that, you should make Du'aa\nto Allah Ta'ala to guide you towards whatever is best for you - doing\nAalimah course or marrying before that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
