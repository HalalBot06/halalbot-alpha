  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaam mufti saab, I went to a mobile shop to get the security code for my phone as it was originally 1.2.3.4.5 but it didn?t work when I got to the shop the shop keeper tried to look on the computer but couldn?t find the program, but the shop keeper didn?t put in any effort in. when I checked the computer my self and switched the phone off and when I put it back on t it worked without even putting a code in. I had walked out of the shop because my brother told me that we didn?t owe him any money for it as he didn?t do anything but I wasn?t sure. Could you please tell me if I still owe him his fee as he didn?t do anything? Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTaking 'Urf (the accepted norm) into account, you don't owe him anything.\nHence, it was correct of you not to pay him anything. However, you should\nhave at least thanked him for searching for the programme.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
