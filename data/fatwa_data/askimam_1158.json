  "question": "If some one deposite money in bank for a fix period and get a fix amount every month is it interest(Hiba) or not?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe excess on a fixed deposit is interest and strictly prohibited.\n\nInterest monies must be given to the poor and needy who are eligible to\naccept Zakaat without the intention of reward. However, interest received\nfrom government institutes, eg. post office could be used to offset\ngovernment taxes. Interest received from private banks cannot be used to\noffset taxes. It may be used to offset interest charged from the same bank.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
