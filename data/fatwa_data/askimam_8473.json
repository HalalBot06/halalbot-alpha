  "question": "about hanafis in the hijaz - there is a hadith collection printed out of Beirut, Lebanon that backs up the hanafi madhab in a 15 volume collection is this true and where can I find it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was asking if the hanafis in the hijaz were Saudis or Indians and Pakistanis living in Saudi Arabia? My reason for wanting to know this is because I would like to go to makkah to study sharia after becoming alim inshallah and I want to know if there is a hanafi ulama there. You gave me a name of one mawlana. Could you tell me more about mawlana Abdul hafiz makki , where is he from and were did he study and how can I contact him by email? Wouldn?t there be a large population of hanafis in the hijaz because it once was under ottoman rule? Also I have heard that there is a hadith collection printed out of Beirut, Lebanon that backs up the hanafi madhab in a 15 volume collection is this true and where can I find it?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMoulana Abdul-Hafi Makki is a Saudi citizen of Pakistani origin. He studied in the Indo-pak subcontinent and is involved in a number of religious affairs. Unfortunately, we do not have any email address through which he may be contacted.\n\nThe celebrate collection is the compilation of Moulana Dhafar Ahmad Thanwi (RA) and is named Ielaa-us-sunan. It could be obtained from its publishers (Darul Kutub al-Ilimiyyah P.O. Box 11-9424, Beirut, Lebanon ? www.al-ilmiyah.com).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
