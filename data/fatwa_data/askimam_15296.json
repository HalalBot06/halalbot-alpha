  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a question, I have heard some scholars mention that al-Hakim and author of Tareekh Tabarri were Shias or with Shia tendencies?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1. The author of Mustadrak Al Haakim, Muhammed bin Abdullah Al Haakim Al Naisapoori, was not a Shia. He was from the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah. Some scholars have falsely attributed Shi’ism towards him, but the academics have rejected this fact and have confirmed that he was not a Shia.\n\nKashf-u-Zunoon Vol:6 Pg:59 (Darul Fikr)\n\nDars-e-Tirmizi Vol:1 Pg:48 (Maktabah Darul Uloom Karachi)\n \n\n2. Abu Ja’far Muhammed bin Jareer Tabri, the author of Jamiul Bayaan fi Tafseeril Quran and Tareekhul Umam wal Mulook, was not a Shia. He was from the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah.   \n\nThere was another author, also named Abu Ja’far Tabri, who was a Shia. He also wrote kithabs on tareekh.\n\nSome scholars have regarded both of them as one person, and attributed Shi’ism towards him; but this is a mistake, as the academics have proven that they were two different people, and only the latter person was a Shia.\n\nKashf-u-Zunoon Vol:6 Pg:26 (Darul Fikr)\n\nDars-e-Tirmizi Vol:1 Pg:251 (Maktabah Darul Uloom Karachi)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
