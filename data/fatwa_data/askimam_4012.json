  "answer": "QUESTION\nI had a dream a while ago, I was sitting cross legged on a transparent floor, i was wearing a white long sleeve shirt, an Indonesian topee and i had dzkir beads in my right hand and a Koran opened infront of me. Everywhere else was black.A women appeared in front of me wearing all white hijab and facing me(but i couldn't make out her face). Out of no where appeared what i think is a jinn of most horid looking, the woman i mentioned somehow repelled this jinn. I wanted to look at her face each time i tried she seemed to turn from me. Finally she turned around to me and i awoke saying Aisha.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf one recites the Qur'aan (Qur'aan being open in the dream), follow its\ninjunctions according to the Sunnah and remembers Allah (Dhikr beads in the\ndream) Allah will create unseen assistance (woman in dream) against all\nmisfortunes (Jinns), Insha Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
