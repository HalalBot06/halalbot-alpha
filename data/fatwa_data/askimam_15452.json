  "question": "Will there be sex in Jannah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWill there be sex in Jannanh? Since it’s a very holy place, and there stated: “ They will be free from menses, child birth.....” , so will there be something like that? And if people are aroused like this world, the holiness of Jannath will remain okay? And since they will be free from all filthy things, and after sex Gosol is must and so on....so I want to know that will there be sex in Jannah ? And even if there is sex, will it be in the format like it is in the World? Please let me know.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe general principal of the bounties of Jannah is explained in the following verse\n\n“And for you in Jannah will be whatever your soul desires.”\n\nIf a person wished to fulfill his base desires in Jannat, he will be granted that. The actual form and details of a dweller in Jannah fulfilling his base desires is known by Allah. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
