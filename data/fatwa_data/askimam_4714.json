  "question": "Fajr Sunnah after Fajr Fard Salaat???",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Mufti Saheb: Asalaamualikum Wr Wb Fajr Salaat: Sometimes I happen to reach the masjid at a time when the Fajr jamaat has already started praying. So, I join them in FARD prayer. Now that I have prayed FARD and not yet prayed 2 rakat SUNNAH. Can I pray the 2 rakat sunnah after the FARD is complete (before sunrise ofcourse), or should I wait till after sunrise to perform the 2 rakat SUNNAH?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA person should read the Sunnats of Fajr Salaat out of the Musjid proper,\neven though the Imaam has commenced his Salaat as long as he knows that he\nwould be able to join the Salaat with Jamaat at least at the point of\nTashahhud, i.e. last sitting. (Shaami vol.2 pg.454; Maktaba Imdaadiyyah)\n\nIf the Sunnats had been missed out together with the Fardh of Fajr Salaat,\nthen Qadhaa of both, the Sunnats and Fardh Salaats should be made before the\ntime of Zawaal, and if Qadhaa of Fajr Salaat is done after Zawaal, then only\nthe Fardh should be performed, not the Sunnats. However, if only the Sunnats\nwere missed, it should not be repeated after the Fardh of Fajr Salaat, i.e.\nbefore sunrise. It may be performed before Zawaal on the same day. (Ibid\npg.512)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
