  "answer": "QUESTION\nI wanted to make a few things clear. Please help me. were the prophets perfect human beings. Did shahwaliullah believe in omnipresence. somebody said something to me about shaitaan. i am a follower of deoband and he was trying to say that you can believe that shaitaan is everywhere but the prophet cannot. please help me out and can you suggest to me a book which helps out on these kind of matters.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Ambiyaa alayhimus salaam were human beings. Together with this, they were special in that they received revelation. The Holy Qur?aan is clear on this, where Allah Ta?ala commands the Nabi to say: Say I am only a human like you, (but) I receive revelation. (18/110)\n\nShah Waliyullah did not believe that the any creation was omnipresent.\n\nShaitaan is not everywhere at once. Firstly, the word Shaitaan is often used for all those jinnaat who are rebellious and assist iblees. Secondly, iblees the main Shaitaan has been given the ability to travel far and wide in a short space of time. This does not make him omnipresent.\n\nWe are not aware of any literature in English. There is a lot of literature available in Urdu.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
