  "question": "Who did influence Iblis (Satan) to be a sinner?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWho did influence Iblis (Satan) to be a sinner? 1. If Satan influence us to commit crime then who moved him (Satan) towards the crime in the first place, since there were no one else to make him commit sinful actions? How did he learn it? If we commit crime because of Satan, then for whom he started to commit the crime? Who influenced him to be a sinner? Some people say that it is his bad Nafs. If it is, then who created and drive that bad Nafs and who put it into Satan?s mind? 2. How does Allah select souls to send to Muslim family and non-Muslim family?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is mentioned in the Hadith that Shaytaan will put many thoughts in a person?s mind. Finally, a thought will be created by the Shaytaan that, if Allah is the Creator, who created Allah? We are advised that at this point we should stop and say ?laa hawla walaa quwwata illaa billaah?.\n\nThe answer to duch a question is beyond us. If we extend your question, it will be that Allah created the Nafs, and then the following question may be about Allah. As Muslims, we should surrender to Allah and His Rasul [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam]. Allah ordered us to control our Nafs. It does not mean that He being the Creator of the Nafs absolves the adherents to Nafs. Every individual, including Shaytaan has the Allah-given ability to control the Nafs as well. This is where the test is.\n\nSubmitting to Allah or to the Nafs by one?s own will. This is why Shaytaan will be punished.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
