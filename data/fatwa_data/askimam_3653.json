  "question": "Should I dress according to the Sunnah even though it may lead to my arrogance?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn a kufr-dominated environment, I want to wear the Shalwar-kurta all the time because it is closer to the Sunnah. However, when I do wear it, I feel a degree of arrogance because I'm the only one dressed like that and people constantly turn their attention towards me. Also, I feel this method of dress is superior to theirs. Should I just go ahead and do it anyway or save myself from Khibr? Jazakallah kkair, and I love your site...May Allah shower you with his blessings.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Sunnah method of dressing is certainly superior to every other form of\ndressing. Pride is to deny the truth and look down upon people. Therefore,\nthe wearing of Sunnah clothing is not pride, rather it is a sign of\nconfidence in maintaining your Islamic identity values.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
