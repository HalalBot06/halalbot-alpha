  "answer": "QUESTION\nHi, im 16 and im currently going throught puberty, my Q is Hairs, i shave my pubic hair every 4 weeks, if not earlier but now im having some more body hairs EXPECIALLY on my legs, chest and behind, i wish to trim it bit by bit, as i think its a hassle while doing ghusl..every part of the hair must be wet etc... but i also heard your not supposed to shave the thighs? i need to know if im allowed to trim any hair on my legs,chest,thigh and behind(buttocks)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, the only hair that have to be removed is the pubic hair which is above the front private part, and the hair under the armpits. It is not necessary to remove the hair from other parts of the body. In fact, in the case of the female, she cannot remove her hair from the head.\n\nWhen making Ghusl, she should ensure that the entire body is thoroughly washed. If she does that, there is no reason to doubt that the Ghusl is complete. The hair on the chest, legs, etc. should not be removed to attain that certainty.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
