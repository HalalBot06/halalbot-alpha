  "question": "When i read namaz my urine drops tend to come out they have no timing and 4/5 namaz i have this problem. I dont know what to do as i cant keep doing wudu and changing my undergarment.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou did not state how often you experience urine drops in order for us to determine whether you are a Ma?zoor or not. If you experience urine drops so often that you are unable to perform two Rakaats Salaat before the next urine drop, then you are a Ma?zoor (excused person).\n\nIf you are a Ma?zoor, then one Wudhu for an entire Salaat time will suffice inspite of the repeated urine drops. Upon the expiry of a Salaat time, the Wudhu will terminate and a new Wudhu will be necessary. Kindly find attached for more information on the laws of the Ma?zoor.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
