  "question": "Punishment in the grave",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWill there be some muslims who will be punished in the grave and after some time in the grave, or on the day of judgment (without entering Jahnnam) they will be granted peace and be rewarded?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAllah will do as He wishes. If Allah decides to punish a person in the grave for a limited period of time, He will do that. Our dua to Allah should be that He grants us Aafiyah and not punish us at all, Ameen.\n\n\n\nWhilst a great amount of Ibadat is a means of attracting Allahâ€™s mercy, His mercy is not confined to an area of attraction. It is beyond that. Our focus should be on Aamaal and more on the mercy of Allah. Inshallah, Allah will deal with us based on our focus on His unlimited mercy.Ameen\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
