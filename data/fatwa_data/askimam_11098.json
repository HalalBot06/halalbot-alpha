  "question": "Advance payment of mahr!will be getting married in June insha-allah, so if I am allowed to make advance payment of mahr what will be the earliest time to do it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaam Hamduillah I have chosen my life partner and I will be marrying her very soon. I have a question regarding Mahr. My companion insha-allah is an orphan and I am very glad, that she will be my life partner. Since the girl is poor and can?t take up the expenses of the marriage, is it possible & permitted in Islam that I pay her the mahr (in Cash) well in advance, which she can use for the actual marriage purpose & do all the expenses with the money of mahr? Note I will be getting married in June insha-allah, so if I am allowed to make advance payment of mahr what will be the earliest time to do it?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, we wish to point out that marriage in Islam is a simple affair and should not incur much expenses. In fact, Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] said, ?The Nikah with the most Barakah is the one with the least expenses.?\n\nMahr in Nikah is paid to the wife as her sole right. If the girl is poor and needy and she needs to make preparations for marriage by purchasing her basic requirements to live with you, for example, clothing, etc. we advise you offer the amount to her as a gift. It is not moral that she uses her honour money ? the Mahr ? for preparations to live with you. Nevertheless, if you offer her Mahr in advance and she uses that amount for marriage preparations, that is also correct.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
