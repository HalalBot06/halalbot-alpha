  "question": "Is it permissible for an unmarried person to read the questions about nikah? Is medical insurance from a medical factory allowed?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is permissible.\n2. The permissibility or otherwise of an insurance policy depends on the\nterms and insurance policy scheme. But leaving aside mutual insurance\nschemes, all the insurance policies available with the traditional insurance\ncompanies run on a commercial basis and contain elements of interest or\nQimar (chance) or both, hence, not allowed. (Contemporary Fataawa; Mufti\nTaqi Usmani)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
