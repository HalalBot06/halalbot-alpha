  "question": "What is the best answer to this question? \"You avoid mix gatherings but go shopping? \"",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. Contraceptive patches can be 'glued' on to the body. So say when one has to take a gusl, would gusl be valid with the patch on or should one need to take it off? ( taking it off before the intended period makes the patch loose its effectiveness)\n\n5. What is the best answer to this question? \"You avoid mix gatherings but go shopping? \"\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. A contraceptive patch is permissible only in the circumstances acceptable in Shari’ah for birth control and there is no adequate alternative. In that situation, one will be excused to leave the patch glued on to the body during Fardh Ghusl. If there is no reason for birth control in Shari’ah or there is an adequate alternative to the contraceptive patch, then it is not permissible to use or leave the patch on during Fardh Ghusl. In such a situation, the Fardh Ghusl will not be valid.\n\n2. Intermingling of sexes is expressly prohibited. That is in all situations. However, there is a difference between mixed gatherings at parties, etc. and at shopping centres. The gatherings in parties, etc. is within our control. The mix there is due to our own plan and design. That could be avoided by separation of the sexes by means of a curtain, etc. When this is not done, then the intermingling will be directly attributed to our own doing. In essence, we created a mixed gathering. That is no so in shopping centres as gathering there is not within our control. One goes there only out of need and necessity. It must be pointed out that if there is no need to go to a shopping centre, it will still not be permissible. Since there is no need acceptable in Shari’ah in going to a mixed gathering, it is not analoguous to going to a shopping centre.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
