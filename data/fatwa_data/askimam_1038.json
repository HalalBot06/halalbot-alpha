  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nContraception (Azl) is permissible on a limited scale for valid reasons -%0D%0Areasons considered by the Shari%E1h to be valid. The circumstances which will%0D%0Apermit reversible and permanent contraception differ.%0D%0A%0D%0AREVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTION%0D%0AAmong the reasons accepted by the Shari%E1h as valid for practising reversible%0D%0Acontraception are:%0D%0A%3E Physical weakness.%0D%0A%3E Sickness.%0D%0A%3E The wife maintaining her beauty or figure for the sake of her husband.%0D%0A%3E The couple being on a journey or in a distant land.%0D%0A%3E Adverse political conditions, e.g. children are forcibly separated from%0D%0Atheir parents as is advocated by communism; etc.%0D%0A%3E The couple decide to separate in the near future.%0D%0A%3E The wife is an immoral person.%0D%0A%0D%0AThere are valid grounds for practising reversible contraception.
