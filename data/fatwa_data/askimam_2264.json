The\nconsequences of chatting, loving, etc. is the actual reason for the\nprohibition.\n\nIf you do not stop now, the love could go much further. We have handled\ninnumerable cases where young boys and girls chat with one another and\nthereafter engage in illicit relationships.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
