  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow strongly should i take the istekara signs? I performed istekara on a girl i really like and she is someone who has the values i'm looking for in a spouse. The istekara did not come out well.  \nA girl i really like who has the values i'm looking for in my spouse is someone i performed istekara on. I asked the girl to do the same. I had dreams that depicted me sailing a ship in a stormy night and also noticed a crazy kid that the girl and i were taking care of. I also started to feel uneasy, compared to before performing the istekara. My mom performed istekara as well and she too received an uneasy feeling. I feel very confused and do not know if i should take the feelings as they come or just go on logically by getting married to this grl. I do not want to hurt my or her feelings since we are too deep into this already. Jazak.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIstikhaara means to seek guidance from Allah on issues one is uncertain about. Allah’s knowledge is complete and comprehensive. He knows the future and what is good for us. Sometimes, we think something to be good for us, but in reality that is bad and sometimes we think something to be bad, but that is good for us.\n\nThere are negative signs of entering into the marriage with this girl. Marriage is a major step and one should not be hasty. Not marrying the girl may be against your wish, but Allah knows that what is best for you. If you are still unsure, continue making Istikhaara and make du’a to Allah to grant you a suitable partner.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
