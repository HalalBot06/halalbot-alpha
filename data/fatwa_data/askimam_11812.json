  "question": "is it right to destroy posters, which effect people in a community although its not a muslim land",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAre we allowed to destroy haram pictures, which the dirty kuffars advertise on boards? May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon you Mufti saab I live in England and opposite the mosque there is one of those advertising boards. Recently the kuffars stuck a picture of nacked women, which bothers quite a lot of brothers. When brothers come and go out the masjid it bothers them and even me It puts my iman in to test and I?m sure it does to other brothers We live in a kuffar country, I want to know your opinion on what we can do next time if a picture like this ever comes up again? Because Although me and the other brothers were thinking of burning it but we decided its too dangers, so we decided to paint over it, and it took us couple of times to get it right Mufti Saab I want to know your opinion on this issue was we right for doing this deed?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs a resident of your country, you agreed to abide by the laws of it. Thus it would not be correct for you to take the law into your own hands in this manner. It could lead to you as well as the Muslim community as a whole being disgraced.\n\nIn future, you would be advised to take the matter up with the local council and complain that this is immoral. If enough pressure is put on them and sufficient complains come in from the community, they are sure to take it down.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
