  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI'd like to seek some advice on a situation that I am in right now. Recently, my sister has started looking into witchcraft. She has told me that she has been casting spells and even admits that they work. However, she also tells me that she believes in Allah, and what she is doing is wrong. Still, she puts her faith and belief in witchcraft more than she does in Allah. I have already advised her many times to stop doing it as I do not want her to commit a sin. Even so, she does not listen to me and I am getting really frustrated at her stubbornness. She knows that it's wrong but she can't explain to me why she still does it.\n\nWhat should I do now? I just cannot watch her continue doing this.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nI need to inform you that your sister is dabbling in a very dangerous activity. You need to understand that black magic & witchcraft are the filthy schemes of shaitaan. They are the devil's past-times. If what you say is true, then it means that your sister has gone astray.\n\nShe cannot both love Allah Ta'ala & shaitaan. She cannot obey Allah Ta'ala & shaitaan.  She has tyo be very clear who is more important to her & whose commands she is prepared to follow.\n\nIt is said that the person who dabbles in witchcraft falls out of the fold of Islam. They lose their imaan. As I have explained, it is the work of shaitaan. Your sister has to decide if she is prepared to make sincere taubah, seek the help of a learned person so that whatever harm she has done to people can be undone.\n\nShe appears to be caught up in the trap of iblees & this means that she has to get long term guidance from a very strong scholar. Speak to her seriously and try to obtain help for her urgently.  Please make sure you encourage everyone whom you know to read the Quran & Hadith in English so all of you can understand what you are allowed to do and not do. We cannot claim ignorance as an excuse for we will be taken to account in this world & the aagirah for indulging in activities like these. We have to understand Allah Ta'ala's commands clearly. There is no room in our life for dabbling in matters that will take us to Jahannum.\n\n \n\nMay Allah Ta'ala guide her & all of us and may we all be protected from the evil schemes of shaitaan. Ameen.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nSocial Dept.\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
