  "question": "I am happily maried to a previously hindu woman, who has converted to islam. My question is related to partaking of food at the home of my hindu in-laws.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy hindu sister-in-law works for an insurance company. She is the sole provider for her parents whom she stays with. My wife and I are invited for lunch or supper. Knowing that the food was prepared with income derived from haraam sources (the insurance company that my sister-in-law works for), can we partake of this food. If not, how do I maintain relations with my in-laws. Also, what happens if my sister-in-law or her parents buy presents for my children from the insurance income? Should we accept the gifts?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOne should not eat at the in-law?s home. It is not because of the insurance, rather because Hindus will not be cautious regarding Halaal.\n\nIf they but a gift, you may accept it and use it. Be kind and polite to them. Visit them at times other than meal times. Drink some juice or something so that they may not get offended that you do not have anything. Be of assistance to them when you can. If you can afford it, buy them some gifts from time to time. The purpose of your relationship with them should be to invite them to Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
