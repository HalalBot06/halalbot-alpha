  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSalam,\n\ni was wondering. In canada i know some muslim people whos father owns a hotdog stand selling hard hotdogs. He does not eat them himself but sells them. Does this mean that all his money is haram? and therefor meaning his family is living off haram money? and say if i go to there house for dinner, would that mean my food would become haram since its coming from him? please guide me\n\nJazakallah\n\nSalam\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nIn principle, if the person is selling Haram food, then the income will be Haram. Hot dogs are also sold with bread. It cannot be said that the entire income is Haram.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
