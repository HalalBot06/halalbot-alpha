  "question": "Allah decrees your Rizq and Rozi",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nQ. Last night while watching the Oprah Winfrey show which was about people winning the lotto and finding money the easy way etc.the  topic of Rozie was discussed amongst my family members.\n\nWhat I need to know is that when Allah(SWT) grants you your rozie for the day, is it of choice that one accepts it in whatever way it comes or  should one  know that it is only acceptable if its from halaal sources. My question is that one's rozie is set out for the day by the Almighty Allah  be it halaal or haraam, are you to make the decision in accepting which ever suits you?\n\n\n\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is our aqida and belief that halal is rizq and haram too is Rizq. (Sharhul Aqaaid) This simply means that the rizq one receives through haram means is also destined as rizq according to the absolute knowledge of Allah. It does not mean that on can indulge in haram to obtain his rizq. It is our belief that if one did not adopt a haram means to obtain his rizq, he will still get it as it is destined for him. nothing can go against the absolute knowledge of Allah.\n\nIt may be difficult for some to comprehend this. If one suddenly wins R10,000 from a casino, how else could he get R10,000?\n\nConsider the following incident. A person came to Ali (RA) and requested for a house. Ali (RA) told him that he does not have a horse. When he gets one, he will consider the request. Later, Ali (RA) did get a horse and told his slave to deliver the horse to the person. Whilst the slave was on his way to deliver the horse, he got tired and decided to rest under a tree. He tied to horse to the tree. The person who made the request to Ali (RA) for a horse and to whom the horse was meant to be delivered to was passing by. He stole the horse and rode it off. Hazrat Ali (RA) conducted a search on the stolen horse and found that the thief was actually the person for whom the horse was meant. Hazrat Ali (RA) said, “How foolish is that person, if he would not have stolen the horse, he would still get it.”\n\nThis example is clear that whatever is destined for one, he will get it. It is our responsibility to adopt halal means to get it. We should strengthen our yaqeen and belief in Taqdeer.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
