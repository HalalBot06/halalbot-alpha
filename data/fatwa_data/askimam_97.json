  "question": "I am involved in a deep and serious relationship with a non-Muslim girl. She is not Hindu, but she is Radasouami. I desperatley need some advice.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI love her and she loves me very much. We both have no doubt that we will be happy together. She is intellgent, beautiful, and has all the qualities I would want in my wife. Problem is that we do not know what the children would be. Please give me some advice on this matter. I do not want the kids suffering in the future. Thanks.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to Shari?ah, a Muslim male may marry only a Christian or Jewish female from non-Muslims if there is no fear of his compromising his Islamic values and principles or else it will be prohibited.\n\nIt is still preferable that the Christian/Jewish female converts to Islam. In your situation, since the female is neither Christian nor Jew, you cannot marry her. She has to convert to Islam in order for you to marry her.\n\nWe advise you seek the guidance of the elders of your family and also make Istikhaara (seek divine guidance) on the matter. Istikhaara: www.jamiat.org.za/isinfo/istikhaara.html.\n\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
