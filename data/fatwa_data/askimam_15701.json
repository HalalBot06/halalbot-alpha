  "question": "Its been 2 years since the husband has been missing. Does Talaaq take place?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAfter being in a nikkah for 10months, the marriage does not work out & a court divorce takes place.  Thereafter the husband disappears & the woman seeks an Islamic divorce.\nIt has been over 2 years now that the husband cannot be contacted or found. \nPlease elaborate on the situation whether the woman may regard herself as divorced, & must she serve her iddat ? Can she now re-marry?\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe woman can not be regarded as divorced if the husband did not divorce her. If the husband is missing, the wife may apply to the Judicial Committee of the Jamiat for an annulment of her marriage. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
