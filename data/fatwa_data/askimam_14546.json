  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to ask a question a person who does not believe in HAJ, Five daily prayers and Mosques. Is he believer or non believer? I accepted Rashidi belief  which is mentioned in  www.tiptopwebsite.com/rashidi  What is islamic doctrine says about this belied? \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf a person does not believe in Hajj, and five daily Salaats, he is not a Muslim. Hajj and Salaat are express orders in the Qur’aan and Ahaadith. A Musjid (mosque) is the house of Allah dedicated for His worship. The respect for a mosque is regarded as a sign of Imaan and belief.\n\nWe did not have time to study the Rashidi belief. You can summarise his belief and forward to us.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
