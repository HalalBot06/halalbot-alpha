  "answer": "QUESTION\nis it okay to perform wudoo naked and ghusl naked is it accepted or must one be covered. Replacing the jummah prayer with thoer is it okay,what happens if you miss three jummahs\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In Ghusl, the entire body is washed. That is not so in Wudhu, and therefore, one should not be unclothed when making Wudhu. It is against shame and modesty to be unnecessarily unclothed. However, the Wudhu performed without clothes will be valid.\n\n2. Jumu?ah Salat is compulsory upon a Muqeem (non traveller). It is a major sin for a Muqeem not to perform Jumu?ah Salaat. If he did miss Jumu?ah Salaat in one Musjid, then he should try to perform Jumu?ah Salaat in another Musjid. If he has missed Jumu?ah Salaat completely, then he has to make up for the missed Jumu?ah Salaats by performing Dhuhr Salaat. He must also make abundant Tawbah and Istighfaar and make a firm intention never to miss Jumu?ah Salaat again in his life.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
