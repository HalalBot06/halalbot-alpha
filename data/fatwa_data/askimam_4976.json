  "question": "wearing silk",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSilk was disliked by Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) because people used it to show off their wealth and status. Such a behaviour is repugnant in Islam. But now silk is artificial and cheap. What is the significance of this prohibition, and should we still stick to the literal meaning of the Ahaadith in our modern and advanced times?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFirstly, the prohibition of wearing silk applies to men only. Women are permitted to wear silk.\n\nSecondly, all the laws of the Shari?ah have a raison d?etat or Illah. The Illah of any rule has to be established from either the Qur?aan, Sunnah, Qiyaas (analogy) and Ijmaa (consensus). (Nurul Anwaar)\n\nYou state, ?because people used it to show off their wealth and status?, what is the proof that this in fact is the Illah? At most, we can say that this may be one of the wisdoms and benefits of the prohibition of silk. The prohibition applies to real silk, whether it is expensive or cheap.\n\nThe prohibition of showing off one?s wealth is established from many Aayaats of the Qur?aan and Ahaadith of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). The Hadith prohibiting silk, by way of inference, supports this point. However, the literal meaning of the Hadith still applies.\n\n\nAl-Mahmood 18"
