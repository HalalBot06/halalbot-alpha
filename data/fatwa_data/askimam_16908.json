  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nVarious places around the Western World Ulamah have started Part-time alim courses for people who are interested.  Could you please comment on how you feel regarding these part time institutions.\n\nHere is something to keep in mind which my teacher(an alim) said:\n\nMy beloved teacher wanted to teach alim course in Madania. But he didn't, he started teaching the Univ. students part-time. He said that his brothers who taught the alim course in Madania had to deal with kids who wouldn't do their stuff, and really didn't care too much. While the Univ. students who came to his class were determined and would ALWAYS be prepared.\n\nPlease shed light on this issue.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nIn our view, the part-time ‘Ālim classes are definitely beneficial. In general, any acquisition of Islamic knowledge from pious learned ‘Ulamā is praiseworthy. It should be known that the core ingredient in acquiring Ulūm is a righteous teacher. Thus, in this regard, the students should be cautious as to whom they take as their tutors and mentors. Knowledge is, has been and will continue to be acquired from heart to heart in succession from Allah تعالى  to Jibrīl عليه السلام , from Jibrīl عليه السلام to Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم , from Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم to the Sahabah رضي الله عنهم, from the Sahabah رضي الله عنهم to the Tābi‘īn رحمهم الله and so forth until it reaches our venerable Shuyūkh and Asātidha and thereafter passes on to us. Ulūm cannot be acquired by the mere reading of books; it must be coupled with the tutelage of a seasoned scholar. Furthermore, it should be kept in mind that the ‘Ālim class is more of a preparatory class that teaches the student how to become a better student and insha Allah, after many years of dedication, an outstanding ‘Ālim. It by no way suggests that after completion of a six or seven-year course he has acquired complete knowledge of the various Islamic sciences. The majority of acquisition of Ulūm really commences after completion of the ‘Ālim course. It is up to each individual student to decide how far he wants to progress. The student has to increase his studies and research after qualifying from the course and cannot suffice on the knowledge he acquired during his initial studies. In this regard, a part-time ‘Ālim student and full-time ‘Ālim student are equal. However, there will always be a degree of separation between a student who devoted his full time and energy towards the ‘Ālim course by sacrificing six or seven years of his life and another student who only studied part-time. The level of sacrifice and hardship faced by the full-time student cannot be equated with that of a part-time student; therefore, the amount of spiritual effulgence and radiance in the knowledge of a dedicated full-time student will outshine that of a dedicated part-time student. This fact should be recognized and accepted by the part-time students; hence, they should show their respect and lower their wings of humility before such ‘Ulamā who have devoted their lives to this sacred ‘Ulūm. A part-time student should never have a feeling of independence from their Shuyūkh and other senior ‘‘Ulamā. Reciprocally, the ‘Ulamā who have studied the full ‘Ālim course should acknowledge the sacrifices of the part-time students and value their efforts as well. They should treat them with honor and respect as fellow students of Dīn. It is of extreme importance that the ‘Ulamā work together in a united front in their attempts to guide the Muslim Ummah. These part-time ‘Ālim classes are exactly what the ‘Ulamā are trying to accomplish, namely, the dissemination of classic Islamic ‘Ulūm. We make Du‘ā that Allah Ta‘āla increases such classes and accepts the efforts of all the Asātidha and students who are sacrificing their time and energy for such a noble cause. Amīn.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Yusuf bin Yaqub,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by (with the following comments):\n\nWe encourage people who cannot enroll as full-time students Dīn due to work etc to enroll in part-time classes with the ‘Ulamā of their locality and derive benefit from them. The intention should be to learn one’s Dīn and practice upon it. It should not be to profess to others one’s knowledge. Special attention should be paid to Taqwā and piety.\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
