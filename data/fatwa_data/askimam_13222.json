  "question": "mukireen hadith dispute the percentage of zakaat, 2.5%",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni wanna ask something about the percentage of Zakaat.... some people said (i.e. munkireene Hadees) that the percentage of zakaat is not restricted to 2.5%, it may be change(increase or decrease) according to circumstances, and they also said that it was happened in the time of Rasoolullah(saw) and Sahaba(rta). Please clearify about this issue and inform me if it was happened in the time of Rasoolullah(saw) and Sahaba(rta) [specially Khulfa-e-Rashideen].\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe objection is raised from the Munkreen-e-Hadith (rejectors of Hadith). Accordingly the Zakaat related issue is secondary. The authority of Hadith is the primary issue. It is only then the answer to Zakaat related issue will be useful.\n\nThe Munkireen-e-Hadith made a claim. It is up to them to substantiate their claim. We will await a response from them. We will also be eager to enter into a discussion on the authority of Hadith with them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
