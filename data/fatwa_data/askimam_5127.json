  "question": "How does a sister properly seek a husband?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs salaam alaikum: I am a 19 year-old Muslimah who is ready to get married, insha'Allah, but I don't know of anyone whom I would like to marry. What is the appropriate way in which to meet someone, since dating is not allowed. JazakAllah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen looking for a partner in life, one must consider the person's piety and\ncharacter. If you do not know of somebody suitable whom you have seen then\nan indication can be made to him via any male of your family.\n\nConsidering present day times, a better way to go about this is to leave it\nupon your parents / guardian who understand your position very well. They\nshould look for somebody who will be suitable for you. When they have found\nsuch a person who also intends to get married, then they should show some\nindication to him via some senior person of his family after which you may\nsee each other. If you have some inclination towards him, you are happy with\nhis character, etc. and he proposes and both parties are happy, then the\nNikah should take place without much delay.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
