  "question": "Welfare ok? When my husband was student (now works), we joined Welfare. We live with in-laws, father works - middle-class. Someone told me we cannot accept welfare. Is this true?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat must I do? When my husband was student (now works), we joined Welfare. It provides some food and medical. We live with in-laws, father works - middle-class. Someone told me we cannot accept welfare, it must go to more needy people. Is this true? Is welfare like zakat? Is medical insurance ok? Is financial aid from govt ok to accept, even if not poor? It will be used for books, clothes etc. Should I pay it back?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We do not know the policy of the welfare organisation and hence our response will be a general one. Your family used to receive welfare assistance when your husband was a student. According to our understanding, he had no source of income at that stage. If the policy of the welfare is to provide assistance only to the unemployed or to students, then it will not be appropriate to continue receiving aid from the welfare as your husband is now employed. If that is not the policy of the welfare, and it provides general assistance to the poor and needy, then it will be appropriate to continue receiving assistance only according to the need. %0D%0AIf the salary of your husband suffices in fulfilling all the basic needs of the family, then it will be incorrect to receive assistance from the welfare.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. It is not permissible to take our medical aid insurance.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. It is permissible to receive government assistance even if one is not poor.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
