  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy wife has been to hajj with her parents in her age of maturity. This year insh.all. We wish to go for hajj. Will it be hajje badal for her? if yes, please let me know the priorities for whom it should be done. jazak allah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is more virtuous to perform Haj-e-Badl than nafl Haj. If Haj was fardh on\nany one parent and he/she did not fulfill the obligation, then Haj-e-Badl\nshould be performed on his/her behalf.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
