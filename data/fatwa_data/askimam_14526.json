The brother will inherit two shares and each sister will inherit one share.\n\nIf your aunt is survived by her five sisters, her (late) brothers, three sons and one daughter, then the sister will inherit two thirds of the estate and the brother’s 3 sons will inherit the remaining one third in equal shares. The niece (late brother’s son) will not inherit.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
