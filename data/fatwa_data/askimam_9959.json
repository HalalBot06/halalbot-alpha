  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)does vomitting break fast. 2) is wiping the neck a part of wudu. Please provide references.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ: Kindly explain when does vomit invalidate fasting.\n\nA: The Fuqahaa have explained different types of vomit. We hereby simplify\nthem as follows: Uninduced (involuntary) or induced. Each of the two could\neither be mouthful or less than a mouthful. Thus, there exist four possible\ncases: (a) Uninduced - mouthful, (b) Uninduced - less than a mouthful, (c)\nInduced - mouthful, (d) Induced - less than a mouthful.\n\nThe vomit in each of these cases could either: a) Exit from the mouth, b)\nUnintentionally swallowed, c) Intentionally swallowed.\nOnly two situations invalidate the fast, a) Uninduced - mouthful -\nintentionally swallowed, b) Induced - mouthful irrespective of whether it is\nswallowed or not. (Darse Tirmidhi vol.2; Darul Uloom Karachi)\n\nIt is Mustahabb to wipe the neck in Wudhu.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
