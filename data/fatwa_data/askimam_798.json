  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was sitting in the train when I felt this pleasent sensation in my heart,looked into the blue sky and remembered Allah and heaven,I dont know why,but from the bottom of my heart it felt as if Allah was communicating something that it felt so good and i was so happy to see such a scene as this has never happened before in my entire life. Is this possible or not.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSufism is a process of spiritual upliftment. It is a way of reforming oneself and attaining closeness to Allah Ta'ala. Spiritual upliftment, reformation and attaining closeness to Allah are orders replete in the Qur'aan. If it is possible for any individual to reform himself, he should do so. However, it is generally noticed that individuals experience difficulties in reforming themselves and seek assistance of a spiritual guide who is pious and adhere to Shari'ah in reforming themselves. The practise of taking allegiance (Bay'at) and following the guidance of one's spiritual mentor is called Sufism. And Allah Ta√£la Knows Best. Was salaam Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
