Is this true?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssalaamu alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakatuh%0D%0A%0D%0A1)According to the Shariah, Jumuah in a village consisting of less than 20 people is not valid. Instead of Jumuah, Zuhr Salaah should be read like any other day. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyah vol.2 pg.301) 2)We are currently researching the answer. Kindly revert to us. 3)It is permissible to kill mosquitoes and ants in the Musjid. (Tahtaawi pg.370 Darul-Kutub Al-Ilmiyyah) %0D%0A4)If the water is free from Najaasat (filth, impurities) it can be used for istinja. It is not permissible to urinate or pass stool inwater. It is sinful to do so and has been expressly prohibited by the Prophet(Salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam). If the pond is 4,5 by 4,5metres or more then the water will remain paak as long as the effect of the urine and stool is not visible in the water. 5)kindly revert to us. 6)After the parents are divorced the mother has the right of custody of the children, but only in their childhood. For a boy up to the age of seven and for a girl up to the age of nine. However if she marries someone who is not a Mahram of the child her right of custody falls off. If for any reason the mother's right of custody falls off, then the maternal grandmother has the right of custody, and after her the paternal grandmother ... Once a reaches 7 and a girl 9 years then the father has right of custody. (Ahsanul-Fataawa vol.4 pg.459 H.M.Saeed, Shaami vol.2 pg.687 Rasheediyyah). If the child is in the mother's custody then the father has visitation rights according to mutual agreement. The father is responsible for the maintenance of the child irrespective of in whose custody the child is in. For a boy this responsibility remains until he is mature and for a girl until she is married.( Shaami vol.3 pg.604 H.M.Saeed). A man ex-wife is in the same ruling as any other non-mahram, i.e. it is not permissible to communicate with her.%0D%0A%0D%0A7)A woman should not remove her purdah even in front of new neighbours.%0D%0A%0D%0A8)Wehave not come across anything to this effect, rather the Prophet(Salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam) has encouraged his Ummah to have a lot of children.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AFor Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AChecked and approved: Moulana Emraan Vawda%0D%0A"
