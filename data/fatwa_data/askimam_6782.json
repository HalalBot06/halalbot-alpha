  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have problem of passing wind due to which my Wudu breaks everytime. i tried medicines for 5 mth but of no use. wind releases continuously during fast & when i dont eat anything. even after going toilet 2/3 times this happens continuously. but then once in 2/3 weeks it happens that this problems does not occur for a day or half & then again starts next day. a brother told me that if this is a continuous problem then you can perform Namaaz with a new Wudu for every Namaaz. also i cant concentrate in namaaz because after doing wudu i am afraid that wind will pass & then when in Ruku & Sajda i feel sometimes that wind has passed even if it has not. sometimes after coming out of toilet i feel as if a drop of urine has fallen in my underwear & sometimes during toilet i see white liquid emerging from penis which is sometimes thick, sometimes thin & white in colour. a brother told me if the liquid is thin then it dosent matter. but if it is thick & wheatish in odour then you will have to take a bath. i cannot smell it for the wheatish smell as there are other foul smells in toilet. due to this i cant perform my namaaz for the whole day till i go to home from office & change my pants & then only i have to perform my qada (missed) Namaaz. this way i mostly everyday miss Zohar/ Asar/ Maghrib namaaz. can i take off my underwear & perform namaaz in pants in the above case?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Continuous passing of wind renders you a Ma?zoor. Perform a fresh Wudhu for each Salaat time. This will suffice.\n\n2. The thick liquid that is discharged when you are in the toilet does not invalidate your Ghusl. You are not required to make Ghusl. We suggest you place a piece of tissue, etc. on your private part to absorb these few drops. Alternatively, if your underpants is soiled, you may remove it and perform Salaat in your pants.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
