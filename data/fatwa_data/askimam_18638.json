  "question": "Q : 1. Is it halal to genetically modify plants, and animals for our liking? 2. Will it be halal to consume such meat and vegetables if substitutes are not available?...",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\n1. Is it halal to genetically modify plants, and animals for our liking? ie. Most of the chickens grown in the United States have been engineered to have larger breasts, smaller thighs, weigh twice as much, and mature twice as fast as natural chickens.\n\n2. Will it be halal to consume such meat and vegetables if substitutes are not available?\n\n3. Many people in the United States are advocating going back to natural plants and animals. As Muslims should we support this cause or keep quiet on it?\n\n4. If a natural grown fruit costs two to three times as much as a genetically modified fruit, will it be considered israaf (wastefulness / extravagance) if one buys the natural fruit instead of the genetically modified one?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nANSWER TO NO.1, 2 &3:\n\n \n\nAllah Ta'ala exhorts us in the Quran Shareef to eat only that which is Wholesome & Pure (Quran 168:2 mankind at large are addressed, Quran 172:2 ; Quran 51:23)\n\n \n\nAfter much study & a complete analysis of a very informative book, Seeds of Deception by Jeffrey M Smith, and also extensive coverage of the following 4 sites; 1) Global research.ca (Seeds of destruction by F.William.Engdahl),2) Seeds of destruction.com, 3) Safeage.org and 4) www.Naturespath.com, we conclude that GM foods are not wholesome. We should completely avoid such foods and encourage others towards growing naturally grown crops & animals.\n\n \n\nHereunder are some quotations from “Seeds of Deception” by Jeffrey M Smith:\n\n \n\n1) Arpad Pusztai's most disturbing findings;( a very thorough learned professor in experiment biology for more than 50 years,published nearly 300 scientific articles,authored or edited twelve books and regularly collaborated with other leading researchers around the globe)\n\n1.1) Rats which were fed GM potatoes suffered damaged immune systems. Their white blood cells responded much more sluggishly than those fed a non-GM diet,leaving them more vulnerable to infection & disease.\n\n1.2) Organs related to the immune system,the thymus &spleen,showed some damage as well.\n\n1.3) Compared to rats fed a non-GM control diet,some of the GM-fed rats had smaller ,less developed brains,livers &testicles.\n\n1.4) Some rats had enlarged tissues,including the pancreas &intestines.\n\n1.5) Some showed partial atrophy of the liver\n\n1.6) Significant structural changes & a proliferation of cells in the stomach &intestines of GM-fed rats may have signaled an increased potential for cancer.\n\n1.7) These rats developed these serious health effects after only 10 days,some of which persisted after 110 days,a time period corresponding to about 10 years of human life.\n\n \n\n2) Internal memos by scientists warned of toxins,allergies and many new diseases which were all ignored by their superiors.\n\n \n\n3) Scientists were offered bribes or threatened. Evidence was stolen. Data was omitted or distorted.\n\n \n\n4) Government employees who complained were harassed, stripped of responsibilities, or fired.\n\n \n\n5) When a top scientist tried to alert the public about his alarming discoveries, he lost his job and was silenced with threats of a lawsuit.   \n\n \n\nANSWER TO NO.4:\n\n \n\nBased on the abovementioned extensive research, paying more for better health would not be termed as Israaf (wasting) as this is to protect ones health.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\nMl. Muhammad bin Hashim Amod,\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
