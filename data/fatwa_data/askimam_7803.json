  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf u missed fajr can you read the qazaa salat after zuhr or can you read it when you wake up and in qazaa namaaz do u hav to read qazaa for the missed sunnat,nafl and farz namaaz or do u only do the farz and can u do qazaa for the missed sunnat and nafl.say if u missed fajr,zuhr & asr due to school can u read all the qazaa for these namaaz?s all at once after maghrib or do you have to do qazaa for fajr in maghrib and qazaa for zuhr in isha and so on.in qazaa namaaz is it only the niyyat (intension) that?s different and the rest of the namaaz is the same as you would normally do it.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Qadhaa Salat could be read at anytime, during the day or night, except for sunrise, sunset and Zawaal (midday). So, if a person missed his Fajr Salaat, he could reat it as soon as he wakes up or at any other time except for the 3 forbidden times.\n\n2. Qadhaa should only be made for missed Fardh and Witr Salaats.\n\n3. Qadhaa for many Salaats can be made one after the other.\n\n4. Yes, in Qadhaa Salaat only the intention changes and everything else is the same. (Aalamgiri vol.1 pg.122)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
