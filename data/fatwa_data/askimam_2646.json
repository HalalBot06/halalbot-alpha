(An-Nisaa), thus Shaytaan tried to pull you in the hole.\n\nIn another verse, He says, 'The tricks of the Shaytaan are weak.'\n(An-Nisaa), man can become strong against Shaytaan by fulfilling the orders\nof Allah Ta'ala, (thus, by saying Allaah Akbar, you hurt Shaytaan).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
