  "question": "praying behind someone who is already praying",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-u-alaikum Mufti Sahib I follow Hanafi madhab and I am from Pakistan. At our university, there are a lot of somali and Arab brothers who come to the university prayer room but I don't know what madhab they follow. Bsacially sometimes they just come and follow us in the namaz even if we're praying nawafil. Sometimes they make us follow others who are just praying on their own. I don't like this idea because we don't even know that we're leading. Can you please explain the ruling on that and also if it's allowed in certain madhabs. jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the conditions for Imaamat are found in you, your leading them in Salaat\nis valid even if they joined you later on.\n\nIf a person commences his Salaat individually and somebody follows him a\nlittle later on, even in another Rakaat, it is permissible even in the\nHanafi Madhab. If you do not want to follow somebody else who is praying on\nhis own, they cannot compel you to do so. On what grounds do they make you\nfollow others?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
