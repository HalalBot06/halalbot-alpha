  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to have the shr’ee ruling on the following:\n\n1) I work for an Islamic Radio Station and I present a children’s programme “live” at the Radio Station for half an hour for five days in a week and my prep work for that program per day is half an hour= 1 hour, and on a Saturday my programme is for one and a half hours and my prep work for the Saturday is one and a half hours= 3 hours, however I only get paid for the one hour for the weekdays and for the Saturday I get paid for the three hours. However after my presentation of the live programme I spend more than the hours that I am being paid for during the entire week preparintg the prizes and also liasing with the callers of my programme and I spend over and above the time that I am being paid for. I also do other programmes as well for the chlidrens corner that is not in my new contract but was part of my full time contract in the past.\n\nHow should I be paid?\n\nFor the time spent at the Radio Station doing all the Radio work\n\nOr\n\nfor only the time I present my live programme for the week?\n\n2) I do editing of bayaans for the Radio Station from home whereby if the tape is 60 minutes, it takes me about two and a half to three hours to edit a tape. After editing the outcome of the tape ready for airing sometimes ends up to 10, 15, 20 minutes of the end product. Kindly note the contract reads as follows “22 by one hour edited cassettes to be done weekly”\n\nIn my previous contract I was being paid for the time that I spent doing all the radio work.\n\nHow do I get paid?\n\nFor the time I spend editing the tape\n\nor\n\nFor the end product of the tape?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe acknowledge receipt of your mail. Mufti Ebrahim Desai is gone abroad and will return towards the end of July. I will forward your mail to his as soon as he returns.\n\nJazakallah\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai\n\nAdministrator"
