  "question": "What advice would you give to the Muslims living in the Western Non-Muslim Lands?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMESSAGE FOR MUSLIMS IN THE WEST%0D%0AMaulana Syed Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi (Rahmatullahi Alayh)%0D%0A%0D%0AYour warm reception and friendliness is a source of great happiness for me. If I do not respect your wishes and express my inner feelings, I would be most ungrateful. If I desire, I could shower you with praises, for Almighty Allah has bestowed me with an abundance of vocabulary, but I would not be fulfilling the right of friendship.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs you are aware, the Prophet Sallallaho Alahi Wasallam had a burning desire to invite humanity to accept Islam. Despite 13 years of untiring effort in Makkatul Mukarramah and 7 years in Madinatul Munawwarah, there was no large scale conversion of non-Muslims into Islam. However, between 7 AH and 10 AH, after Fateh Makkah until the Prophet?s demise, there was such an influx of people entering into Islam as was not witnessed in the preceding 20 years. %0D%0A%0D%0AImam Zuhri Rahmatullahi Alayh, an eminent Muhaddith and Tabee, expresses surprise on this sea change, with so many people embracing Islam in a matter of just 3 years. He along with other distinguished Muhaddith have commented that this large scale conversion was due to non-Muslims having an opportunity, for the first time, to observe and intermingle with Muslims, witnessing their honesty, fair dealing, compassion, and their sole reliance on Almighty Allah. This left such a deep and profound impression on non-Muslims that thousands entered into the fold of Islam within a relatively short period of time. %0D%0A%0D%0AThis incident also contains abundant lessons on how Muslims should live in this country. Their conduct should be so sublime and captivating that whosoever sees us accepts Islam. Whosoever sits with us should be inclined towards Islam. There should be no need to convince anyone to accept the Truth.%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore, in this country, if you wish to live peacefully and have an opportunity to present Islam to the host community, you will need to inculcate and manifest sterling qualities ? not just inside the Mosques ? but also outside in the streets, in the markets, in your daily activities, and at home. A life of Taqwah will immediately attract non-Muslims towards Islam.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs an ordinary student of Islam it is my religious responsibility to warn you. If you do not lead an upright life, if you continue to live an insular lifestyle, and if you fail to manifest the beauty of Islam to non-Muslims, then you face some real dangers. In such a case, there is no reason for you to feel content and secure in this country.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf ever the fire of race, religion or nationalism rages here, then you will not be saved. In Spain, there were Mosques a hundred times more beautiful than yours. So do not feel content and self-satisfied. As an ordinary student of religion, I would wish to express my joy and happiness at this wonderful new Mosque. But how shall I congratulate you on your achievement when the words of congratulation are self-evident on the walls. How better can I compliment you?%0D%0A%0D%0AOthers may not speak to you as plainly, but remember the glorious Masjid-e-Cordova still stands in Spain. Iqbal so eloquently reminisces the great legacy of Islamic Spain in his famous poem Masjid-e-Qurtaba. In Islamic Spain there were such brilliant Mosques, celebrated Madressahs, famous scholars, for instance Shaykh-e-Akbar, Ibne Hazm, Qurtubi, Shatbi - and how many others shall I mention? However, when the flames of religious sectarianism raged, then the Mosques and Madressahs became deserted. Once Islamic Spain boasted such magnificent structures, distinguished educational centres, and a refined culture and society. Regrettably the Muslims, despite such a high standard of living, did not draw the native non-Muslims of that country to see the Truth of Islam, to warn them of the dangers of disbelief, with the result that religious violence subsequently consumed Muslims like a morsel. The Arabs with their glowing history, architectural splendour, vast ocean of knowledge, were displaced from the country, and today the ears eagerly wait to hear the Adhaan and the empty Mosques thirst for your Salaat. %0D%0A%0D%0AYou must earn your place in this country. You should leave an imprint on the host community of your usefulness. You must demonstrate your existence here is more beneficial than that of the native people. You must impart on them the lessons of humanity. You should demonstrate how noble and principled you are, and that there cannot be found more upright humans elsewhere besides you. You need to establish your worth, that you are a blessing and mercy for this country. However if you decide to live in an enclosed environment content with your Prayers and Fasting, apathetic to the people and society you live in, never introducing them to the high Islamic values, and your own personal qualities, then beware lest any religious or sectarian violence flares up. In such a situation you will not find safety.%0D%0A%0D%0AI pray to Almighty Allah my prediction is totally untrue and baseless. Remember, you are guests here. Your Tabligh, Mosques, Madressahs, Ibaadah, and religious sacrifices are all worthy of commendation. May Almighty Allah grant you Barakah, but do not forget to earn your place in this country. Gain mastery of the national language and become proficient so that you can use it effectively to propagate Islam. Prepare writers and orators and, although you will distance yourself from their religion, do not distance yourself from them. Earn credibility through your daily activities, so much so that if you are entrusted with onerous responsibilities, as was Prophet Yusuf Alayhis Salaam, you do not shirk but embrace all challenges wholeheartedly. %0D%0A%0D%0AYou will have to present a new pattern of life to this country. You will not earn recognition by exerting yourselves in the workplace. If you overwork, you will looked upon disparagingly and be likened to horses and bulls and labelled as money-making machines. However if you can show to the natives here that you are worshippers of Almighty Allah and not wealth, you do not bow before power but only before virtue, you are humans and think like humans, you are concerned not only about yourselves but also about others, and you are compassionate not just to your own children but also to theirs - and to them - you are earnestly concerned about the path of destruction they have chosen for themselves, you will then earn their respect. They will begin to respect Islam and become desirous of studying it. They will ask you for literature concerning Islamic beliefs and practices, and an opportunity will arise here for you to propagate Islam. %0D%0A%0D%0AHowever if you remain preoccupied in eating and working and engaged in Prayers, indifferent to what is happening in the country, insulated within Muslims, totally apathetic to what is happening outside, which direction the country is taking, in such a situation if there is any trouble you will not be able to save yourselves.%0D%0A%0D%0AI have been meaning to convey and emphasise this message to you, because I do not know whether I will be able visit you in the future. You gathered here with love and affection and therefore it was easy for me. As a student of religion it would have been convenient for me to suggest virtues of reciting various Zikr or prescribe certain Wazifahs, but you might not have had an opportunity of listening to the message I have just conveyed from anyone else.%0D%0A%0D%0APlease strengthen your position in this country and earn your recognition. Do not be like a straw or crop that is uprooted by the slightest breeze. You should be so firm that not even a hurricane is able to shift you. Display such noble character that you enslave the natives, then see how these people will stand to defend you. If there is the slightest opposition against you, they will be the first ones to argue on your behalf and vouch what a blessing you are for them. %0D%0A%0D%0AMay Almighty Allah grant us the ability to understand what is right; may He bless and protect you. Ameen."
