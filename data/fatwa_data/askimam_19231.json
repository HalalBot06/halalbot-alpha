  "answer": "QUESTION\nHi, I am a new beginner in salah. I am married and my wife is asking for a intimacy sometimes, I know that after conjugal relations I must take a shower. But it is sometimes impossible to take a shower because there is no opportunity at home.\n\nWhen I refuse, my wife gets frustrated with me and I do not want to overlook her rights as well.\n\nWhat should I do in this case? I want to perform salah but I do not have a chance to take a shower, please let me know, can I do tayammum?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nMay Allah keep you firm in salah. What do you mean by not having opportunity to take a shower at home? Is there no water? Or is it too cold and hot water is not available and you fear getting sick? What is the actual problem? Kindly elaborate.\n\n \n\nPlease email us at admin@daruliftaa.net\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\n \n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
