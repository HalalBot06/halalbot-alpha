  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nplease advise on what conditions can a female muslim preform haj.please note she has recently reverted to islam, and single. jazakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\nThere are two conditions which are specific for women in addition to the general conditions of haj.\n\nIt is necessary for a woman who intents to go for Haj that she is accompanied by a mahram or her husband. Mahram are those relatives with whom she cannot get married.\nThe second condition is that she should not be in iddat (waiting period of four months after the demise of her husband or three menstrual periods after divorce).\n\nIf any of these conditions are not found she will be excused for delaying her haj.\n\n \n\nمناسك ملا على قارى 55\n\nولوالجية 1/254\n\nبدائع الصنائع 2/299\n\n \n\nThese conditions are according to the Hanafi madhab. Anybody following another madhab should consult an Alim of that particular madhab.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Ishaq E.
