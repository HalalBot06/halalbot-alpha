  "question": "khulfa-e-rashidin selected by God or elected by the person, if selected by God than it must be the part of imaan if elected by the persons, we should say them Muslim rulers",
  "answer": "QUESTION\ni still required the answer of my question that khulfa-e-rashidin selected by God or elected by the person, if selected by God than it must be the part of imaan if elected by the persons, we should say them Muslim rulers if they were muslim rulers than how its a part of imaan, my mind is not clear kindly fully answer me so i may able to satisfied to my friend who belongs to shiit, I know the all Khulfa(raa) were muslims but confusion is that why we can say kafir to any body who read the kalama I hope you will answer me urgently in the light of islam/quran/history\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Allah Taâ€™ala orders us to obey Allah, His Rasul [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and the Ulul amr (people of law). The Ulul amr are Muslim rulers. In this respect, to obey Muslim rulers is part of faith as that is the order of Allah.\n\n2. In order to be a Muslim, one should also believe in the basic aspects of Deen. For example, Salaat, Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] being the final Prophet of Allah, Zakaat, Hajj, etc. If one merely recites the Kalimah and denies any basic aspect (Dhurooriyyaat) of Deen, that is not sufficient.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
