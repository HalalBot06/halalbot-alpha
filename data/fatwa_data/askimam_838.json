  "question": "What is the fatwa of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah's ulama regarding Wahabi or Salafis?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am disturbed to learn that they place Allah swt in a direction. According to them that Allah is in the throne, Allah is above us. Am I right to be disturbed by their comment. They said they have al Quran and Sunnah to backed their claim. Please tell us the Aqidah of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah regarding this. So i would not be confiused.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSaadu-deen Taftazani has explained the aspect of 'Where is Allah' in the following words, 'And he is not at any place'. (Sharh Aqaaid)\n\nImaam Maalik was asked about the Aayat in Surah Taaha, 'Allah is above His Ársh', he answered 'Being above (Istawaa) is known but the reality is unknown and - questioning that - is innovation.' Jaaluddin Suyyuti also comments on the Aayat saying, 'Istawaa (being above) according to whatever is appropriate for Allah. (Jalaalayn vol. 2 p. 260).\n\nHowever, the verse does not speak about the Zaat of Allah Taãla being on the Ársh but it is to indicate the establishment and control of the Kingdom of Allah by Himself.\n\nAnd Allah Taãla Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
