  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy grandfather passed away on 12 April 2006. He was a partner in several businessess. His wealth which was to be distributed was calculated before 30 June 2007. every year everyone of the hiers used to calculate their zakats on the 30 June of the respective year. Now all the hiers wil be recieving their share before 30 June 2007. Since no one knew what whould be their share so they did not include their share in the calculation of Zakat for the year 2006. My question is that when they shall get their share before 30 June this year, will the zakat be applicable for 2 years or 1 year i.e the year when they get possession? Since no one knew what was to be his share in absolute terms. \\\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is compulsory to give zakat of the inheritance of the previous year as well on condition the amount of inheritance is zakatable according to the shariah laws of zakat.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
