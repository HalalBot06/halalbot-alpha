  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIn my ultra sound my baby has problem with left leg and foot. Please tell me some doa to cure this before the baby borns\n\nI am 26 weeks pregnant. i had my ultra sound three days back n have been told by doctors that my baby has severe deformity in the lower portion of left leg and foot (one bone in left leg is missing). therefore when she would grow up they will have to amputate the lower part of left leg and replace it with artificial limb. I am very depressed. The doctors are giving no hope and are telling me that I should go for termination (abortion). please tell me some doa and Qurani ayas that i can recite and get this thing cured before the baby is born. please reply soon.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah is our Creator and He has absolute knowledge of the unseen. Allah is Hakeem-All Wise and his intentions are full of wisdom. Due to our limited understanding we cannot comprehend the goodness that Allah has placed in this.\n\nWe cannot rely on the information of the doctors nor their technology. Allah has created the child and He has the full power over the outcome of the child. According to Shariah, it is not permissible to abort the foetus after 16 weeks of pregnancy. Turn your attention towards Allah and beg Him to make the child normal and healthy. It is possible that the information of the doctors are incorrect.\n\nWe have been informed of cases where some foetus were diagnosed with similar abnormalities. But with the help and power of Allah, the information provided by the doctors were belied. Rasulullah () had advised cure your sick with Sadaqah (charity). Therefore, according to your ability offer sadaqah everyday and have full hope and reliance on the mercy of Allah. Surely, He will assist you through your difficult times.\n\nMay Allah make it easy for you through these difficult days and grant you a normal and healthy child who will become an assest for the Muslim Ummah. Ameen\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best"
