  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamu'alaykum, herewith my two questions: 1. I want to know the authentic source for this kind of sholat hajat wich was given by one 'alim when he came to our mohallah; 4 rakaat sholat hajat with only one time tahiyyat (only in the last rakaat after second sajadah), in first rakaat after al-fatihah recites 10 times surah al-ikhlas, second rakaat after al-fatihah recites 20 times al-ikhlas, third rakaat 30 times al-ikhlas, forth rakaat 40 times al-ikhlas, and after salaam 50 times al-ikhlas follow by istighfar 50 times and then 70 times laa hauwla walaa quwwataa illaabillaah... after that du'a, If it available please explain in detail how to perform this sholat. 2. What is or who is Al-Mansoor regarding to the following hadits : The Holy Prophet, praise and peace be upon him, said: \"A man called Al Harth will come from beyond the river. At his front is a man called Mansoor who will pave and establish the government for the family of Muhammad just as the Koraysh established it for the Messenger of Allah praise and peace be upon him. It is obligatory for all believers to support him or he said obey him.\"\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There is no reference in the Qur'aan or Hadith for the type of Salaatul\nHaajat explained in the details of your letter.\n2. Mansoor is an Arabic word meaning to be assisted. It refers to one of the\nmany pious leaders to come before Qiyaamat. It is possible that Mansoor\nrefers to Imaam Mahdi (RA).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
