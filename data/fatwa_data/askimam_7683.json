  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is the Diference between Deobandi, Bareilwee Shia and sunni who is better comparative study please\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe differences between the Sunni and Shi?as, Deobandis and Barelvis are not of who is better, but of who is right and wrong.\n\n1. Shi?as are not Muslims. There are fundamental differences between Sunnis and Shi?as. In fact, many prominent Shi?a scholars do not believe in the present text of the Qur?aan.\n\n2. Barelvis are guilty of committing innovation (Bid?at) and therefore, they are deviated from the true path - the path of Sunnah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
