  "question": "which view should a muslim living in country other than saudi do...",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nwhich view should a muslim living in country other than saudi do, follow majority for ramadhan orfollow saudi for their timing?- is saudi like the main decision maker for ramadhan and islamic month for the world? why do so many people believe this, did the prophet (saw) make saudi as the criteria or where we live?\nan example is in uk where majority started their fast on sunday morning, while arabs and bengalis on saturday morning. they keep claming that we are supposed to follow the saudi for their timing, if thats the case why dont they just read salah according to their timing not in uk, why not read maghrib when it is asr for us?\nbased in quran\n\"...So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of)\n the month (of Ramadân), he must observe Saum (fasts) that month...\" [Holy Quran 2:185]\ni have read in hadith that\nIbn Umar (ra) reported that Allah's Messenger (pbuh) made a mention of Ramadan and he with the gesture of his hand said: “The month is thus and thus. (He then withdrew his thumb at the third time). He then said: Fast when you see it, and break your fast when you see it, and if the weather is cloudy calculate it (the months of Sha'ban and Shawwal) as thirty days.”\nand\nKuraib (ra) reported that Umm Fadl (ra), daughter of Harith, sent him (Fadl, i.e. her son) to Mu'awiya (ra) in Syria. I (Fadl) arrived in Syria, and did the needful for her. It was there in Syria that the month of Ramadan commenced. I saw the new moon (of Ramadan) on Friday. I then came back to Medina at the end of the month. Abdullah b. 'Abbas (ra) asked me (about the new moon of Ramadan) and said: When did you see it? I said.: We saw it on the night of Friday. He said: (Did) you see it yourself?-I said: Yes, and the people also saw it and they observed fast and Mu'awiya also observed fast, whereupon he said: But we saw it on Saturday night. So we would continue to observe fast till we complete thirty (fasts)\n or we see it (the new moon of Shawwal). I said: Is the sighting of the moon by Mu'awiya not valid for you? He said: No; this is how the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) has commanded us.\nif thats case, why is there so much curuption regarding this? why do they not follow\nthe hadith of bukhari and muslim Quran?\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n  Unfortunately the Saudi criterion of commencing a new month is incorrect and has no basis in Shariah. It is not permissible for the Muslims of U.K. to follow Saudi sighting. If the people of U.K. commenced their Ramadan fast with Saudi, that was actually the fast of Shabaan. That will be regarded as nafl fast. If they made Eid with Saudi, that would be the 30th of Ramadan. They will have to make qadha of that fast. \n  This is the view of many senior Ulama and Muftis of England as well, with whom I personally discussed this issue. Unfortunately in some Masaajids and Organizations, trusties make incorrect decisions and the Ulama are left helpless.\n  Alhamdu Lillah, there is a great awareness in England now and the correct practice of moon sighting or following a country with proper moon sighting is spreading. The general masses should go on a Shariah compliant campaign on proper moon sighting in England and rally around those Ulama who are working timelessly to ensure Ibadaat of the people of U.K. is fulfilled correctly.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
