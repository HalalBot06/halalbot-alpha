  "question": "He is a sunni hanifi brother and will soon do nikah with a sunni hanafi girl, however she has shiia parents",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamu alaykum. I am asking this on behalf of a close muslim friend. He is a sunni hanifi brother and will soon do nikah with a sunni hanafi girl, however she has shiia parents of the type who hate and curse some sahaba (RA), worship Ali (RA) and his (RA) grave, have dis-honourable views about some of Nabi (SAW) wives which to my understanding makes her parents non-Muslim. also her father is an alcoholic who doesnt ever pray namaaz's. My close friend is a strict muslim who will only go ahead with doing the nikah with this muslim girl if it is permissable so i want to be able to advise him. She was the same kind of shiia as her whole life until she converted to sunnism and washed away the false shiia beliefs she had before and she became follower of the Hanifi madhab. She tried giving dawah to family but was scolded at, threatened with violence and beatings and disownership, she now keeps secret most of her sunni beliefs from them. Can u clarify on the following points according to the Hanifi madhab:\n\n1) does he need the permission of her parents/walee for the nikah (her whole family i.e. all male relatives are of the same shiia kind) ?\n2) must a local imaam be her walee or can the nikah be done without a walee ?\n3) what are the conditions of nikah and can it be performed by any practising muslim man for them? (e.g. me) also tell me about the requirement of witnesses, can it be done without any?\n\nthanks you for your time jaazaakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is permissible for the Sunni brother to marry the girl. She is also a Sunni. She does not require the permission of her parents to marry. She is an adult and she may marry a person of her choice.
