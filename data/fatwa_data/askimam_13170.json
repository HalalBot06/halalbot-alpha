People think iam mad that i am thinking of rejecting this person. Islam is important to me he is very much into dunya .......WS\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMarriage is a major step in ones life. It could be a turning point of good or bad. Allah has the knowledge of the unseen. His knowledge is complete and absoloute. It is for this reason when one is confused for and activity, he/she should make Istikhaara. Istikhaara means to seek guidance from Allah. Therefore, we suggest that you make istikahaara.\n\nFurthermore, to consult with your parents or seniors of the family is extreamly important. Based on their knowledge and expirence of life they will advise you.\n\nYou state that the boy is of good character but does not pray regularly. We invite you to consider the opposite of this. If you get married to him and you with wisdom and diplomacy encourage him to perform his Salaah, wouldn’t that be an achievement for you for which he will also appreciate?\n\nWe therefore suggest that you reconsider and do not make this an excuse of refusing the proposal.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nFor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
