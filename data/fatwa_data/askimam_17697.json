  "question": "Can you please advise me whether I should accept this dream as guidance on my original question for istikarah (although Istikarah was not performed on this night), or whether the dream is not valid?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nLast year I started my ACCA, and since then I have been wondering whether this has been the right decision for me.  I have been extremely confused about which career I want to go into and as a result, I decided last week to do Istikarah to help me to make this decision.\n\n \n\nI started to do istikhara early last week on whether ACCA is the right profession for me, and if it isn’t, to show me another path.  However, I didn’t get a dream on the 1st night, so I decided to continue for the next 7 days.  On the 4th day however, I couldn’t perform Istikarah and therefore, this broke the practice.  Nevertheless, a couple of days later, I had a dream that it was summer time and I was told by my manager that I would be losing my job.  At this point, I was upset and crying because I realised that I would have no money but at the same time I was also relieved as I felt it was the right thing to do.  Furthermore, I woke up from my dream feeling relieved.\n\n \n\nCan you please advise me whether I should accept this dream as guidance on my original question for istikarah (although Istikarah was not performed on this night), or whether the dream is not valid?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nOur opinion is that you continue with your istikhara. You should also seek advice from appropriate people and make a decision based on that.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
