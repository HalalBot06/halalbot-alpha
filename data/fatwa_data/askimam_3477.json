  "question": "There is a hadith that says 'One who breaks ties of relationship will not enter paradise.'",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nOur Mother divorced our Father, and married another man. No one else in the family meets her, not even her own family, because she married our stepfather against the wishes of her Parents and siblings. Now our family does not let us meet our Mother. We used to meet her without our Father's knowledge, but when he found out, he made us take an oath that we will never meet her. If we meet her again then no one in our family will meet us, including our Father. We have sworn that we will not meet her unless our Father gives us permission to do so (Before we gave him our word, my brother told him that he is committing a sin by stopping us from meeting our Mother and that he will be the one who will be answerable to Allah for committing this sin). What we want to know is that according to this hadith, did we commit a sin by promising not to meet her or stay in any kind of contact with her? And also, will our Father not be able to go to Paradise because of this decision of his? And what about her family's decision in not staying in touch with her? Jazakallahu Khairan\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to the Shari’ah, only a male has the right to issue a divorce.\nTherefore, if your father did not issue your mother with a divorce, the\nNikah between your mother and father is valid. Your mother’s subsequent\n‘Nikah’ with another person is invalid.\n\nIf your father issued a divorce and your mother remarried after the Iddat\nperiod, then the Nikah is valid. Your father is now a stranger to her and he\ncannot communicate with her. There is no Shar’ee reason for you and your\nmother’s family to break communication with your mother. It is also\nincorrect for your father to stop you from visiting your mother. The promise\nmade to him is a sin and invalid.\n\nAllah Ta’ala has ordered to be kind and polite to one’s mother. Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ‘There is no obedience to the creation\nof Allah against the order of Allah.’ Therefore, you should not obey your\nfather in discommunicating with your mother.\n\nand Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
