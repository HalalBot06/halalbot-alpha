  "question": "We have enough money,What should be our first preference Hajj or zakaat and Why?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf one has the financial means to perform Hajj, then Hajj becomes\ncompulsory. If one year has passed on the Zakaatable amount, then Zakaat\nalso becomes compulsory.\n\nIt is possible that the one year for Zakaat to be due may expire before Hajj\nor after Hajj. If it expires before Hajj, then Hajj will be compulsory only\nif the surplus amount after discharging Zakaat is sufficient to perform\nHajj. If the year expires after Hajj, then Hajj has to be performed. If the\nsurplus amount is equivalent to the Nisaab of Zakaat or more, then only\nZakaat will be compulsory on that amount. There will be no Zakaat on the\namount used for Hajj.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
