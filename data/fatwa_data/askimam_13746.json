  "question": "she takes the left over food home which the cooks says she can even though the cook is not in charge.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy sister works for the local school preparing school meals with the cook. At the end of the day, she takes the left over food home which the cooks says she can even though the cook is not in charge. Anyway, is my sister allowed to take the food home? I have told her that i dont think she can but my sisters' argument is that the food will end up in the bin.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf the cook and your sister are aware that the food being prepared is more than the daily requirement, then they should inform the management of the school about that.\n\nIf there is still excess food and the food will be thrown away, it is advisable for your sister to inform the management that she will take the food home.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
