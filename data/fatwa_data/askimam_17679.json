  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nA school has a problem of vandalism. At times, school furniture, elctrical fittings are destroyed and vandalised. It is known that students from a perticuler class are involved however no individuals ever own up to it. \n\nIn such a scenario, how best can the school deal with  such a problem:\n\n(a) Can the school impose a fine on the entire class to pay for the damage?\n\n(b) Can the school make each individual from the class take an oath that they are not responsible. Thereafter, whoever refuses to take the oath will be fined?\n\n(c) If non of the above are permissble, how best can the school deal with such a problem?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAt the outset, it will not be permissible to utilize methods (a) and (b) which are mentioned in the query. Accusations without daleel (evidence) cannot justify the use of these methods. Hereunder are a few possible solutions to remove the problem:\n\n1) The school administration may slightly increase the student fees for everyone or send out a warning to parents that if acts of vandalism occur in the future then the school will increase the fees. This slight increase can cover the costs of the damage.\n\n2) The school may hire guards to monitor the school so that acts of vandalism can be prevented.\n\n3) The school may install live security cameras so that problematic areas can be monitored.\n\nIt is also extremely important and necessary to teach the students proper Islamic etiquette and manners and to explain the sin and consequences of damaging property which does not belong to them. Students should be taught Ahadith of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) along with stories of the Sahaba (RadiyAllahu Anhum). It would also be beneficial to relate stories of our Akabireen who lived closer to our time period so that they may be used as examples of how one must life their life by sticking to the commandments of Allah Ta’ala and the Sunnah of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\nMl.
