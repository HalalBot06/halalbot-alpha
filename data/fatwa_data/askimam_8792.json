  "question": "Can Person A tap Person B on the shoulder, while Person B is reading salaah alone, so that Person A may join him and the 2 form a jamaat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe above is a practice in Cape Town. Is there any basis in any of the mathaahib for it? After person A taps person B, person A begins to read as if he is imaam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, it should be understood that the Imaam making Niyyat of being Imaam is not a condition for the validity of following him. Thus, even if he doesn?t know that he has been made Imaam, following him will be correct.\n\nIt would be better to inform him by not disturbing him, then such a manner should be adopted otherwise the prevalent practice of tapping him could be used. We are unaware of the standpoint of other Madhaahib on this issue.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
