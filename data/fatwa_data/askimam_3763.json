  "question": "Do you have to raise your hand up to the level of your shoulders when you bow down for ruku and when you rise from ruku.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe last prophet used to raise his hands up to the level of his shoulders or near his ears when going for ruku and rising from ruku.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Majority Madhaahib (Shaaf'ee, Maaliki and Hanbaliy), one is\nrequired to make Raf-ul-Yadayn before going to Ruku and when coming up from\nRuku.\n\nAccording to Imaam Abu Hanifa, there is no Raf-ul-Yadayn before and after\nRuku. Both opinions are substantiated from Ahaadith. Based on the principle\nof Taqleed, every person should follow the ruling of his Madhab as our small\ndrops of knowledge cannot be compared to the Imaam's oceans of knowledge. We\ndo not have that qualification to judge which Imaam's Ijtihaad is correct or\nincorrect. Therefore, we should trust the Ijtihaad of any one Imaam we\nfollow and practise upon his ruling.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
