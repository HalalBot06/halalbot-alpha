  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs Salamu Alaikum Bismillah A brother told me this dua ?La illaha illallahu malikul haqul mubeen Muhammadur Rasulullahu Sadequl Wa Deul Amen? he claimed it to be inscribed upon Masjidun Nabi SAW and on Baitullah, he said it was a dua of need, is this true and if so what are the benefits of this dua and can you translate it into English, inshallah? Also on your website, question 5228, you said you didn?t know the arabic name for the dome of the rock I am quite sure that it is ?Qubbat al-Sakhra?. Also is the Essential Hanafi Handbook of Fiqh a translation of Qazi Thanaa Ullah?s Mala Budda Minhu by Maulana Yousaf Talal Ali accurate? Can you quote the ahadith that say not to raise hands before and after ruku? And also the ahadith that say to place the hands below the navel?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We have managed to trace the following narration: Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, ?Whoever recites this Du?aa 100 times daily, it would be a protection for him from poverty, a means of acquiring wealth, he will be saved from the trials of the grave ?? (Tarikh Baghdad vol.12 pg.358; Al-Hilya vol.8 pg.309)%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, has been classified as a fabrication by the masters of Hadith such as Hafidh Dhahabiy and others. (refer Mizaanul I?tidaal vol.2 pg.490; Lisaanul Mizaan vol.1 pg.170, vol.4 pg.37). Hence, it would not be proper to rely on this narration when establishing the virtue of this Du?aa.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe translation is, ?There is none worthy of worship but Almighty Allah who is the only rightful king and Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is the messenger of Allah and he is one who fulfils his promises and one who is trustworthy.?%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Ml. Yusuf Talaal is an authentic Aalim and translator.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Imaams Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi, Nasaaie (RA) have recorded in their Sunans that once Sayyiduna Abdullah ibn Mas?ood (Radhiallaahu Anhu) said, ?Should I not show you the Salaat of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)?? He, then stood up and he raised his hands for the first time (for Takbir-e-Tahrima). Thereafter, he did not raise his hands. (Sunan Abu Dawud pg.109; Sunan Tirmidhi pg.58; Sunan Nasaaie vol.1 pg.158). The narration has been classified as authentic by Imaam Nawawiy. Refer Aathaar-us-sunan pg.133%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Sayyiduna Waail ibn Hujr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) says, ?I saw Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) place his right hand over his left hand below his navel in Salaat.? (Musannaf ibn Abi Shaybah vol.1 pg.390). The narrators of this Hadith have been classified as authentic by Allaamah Muhammad Abid Sindi (Aathar Sunan pg.90). It was also the practice of several illustrious Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) such as Sayyiduna Umar ibn al-Khattaab, Sayyiduna Aliy, Sayyiduna Abdullah ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhum) not to raise their hands before nor after Ruku. (Musannaf ibn Abi Shaybah vol.1 pgs.236-237 also refer to Aathaarus sunan of Allaamah Nimwai pgs.134-140)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
