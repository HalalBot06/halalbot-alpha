Many non-Muslims graves are honoured. This in no way means that they are in a good condition. Similarly, a person’s grave been desecrated does not mean that he is being punished. \n\nYour concern regarding your Iman is a sign of good Iman. Thieves target places where treasures are stored. Similarly, the devil targets that hearth which has good faith in Allah Ta’ala. Sayyiduna Abu Hurayrah رضي الله تعالى عنهnarrates that some of the companions of the Messenger of Allah came to him and complained of getting such evil thoughts that they could not even mention it. Nabi صلى الله عليه وسلم replied: this is a clear sign of Iman. (Muslim 79 Qadeemi)\n\nYou should not pay much attention to such a condition. Rather, continue to obey Allah Ta’ala and stay away from His disobedience. This is a trick of shaytan to make feel down, and that you are not gaining anything thereby making you go back to your old ways and habits. Insha Allah by continuing with righteous deeds and staying away from evil Allah Ta’ala will grant you His love and recognition and let you taste the sweetness of Iman.\n\nTry to supplicate unto Allah Ta’ala excessively. Ask Allah Ta’ala to help you preserve your Iman and grant you complete Iman. Also, try to recite as much as Quran as possible. Keep in contact with a local Alim with whom you can relate with.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl. Ishaq E.
