  "question": "I have question regarding the sending of chain mails, where they say that if you do, this good thing will happen, and if you donâ€™t, this bad thing will happen.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nChain mails are emails where you get told that you should pass it on to others. ---- Example Starts Below This ---- Believe In that... !! this is in arabic.. this is what it says.. A young girl had a very serious illness.. nothing could cure her.. On laylet el qadr.. the girl was asleep..and in her dream.. Zainub (our prophets (sallah allah 3ala wa salm) daughter) gave the young girl some water.. in the morning when the girl got up her illness had cured.. next to her bed..she found a piece of material saying that she must distribute that to 13 people.. and so she did.. A navy officer sent this letter to 13 people and he was promoted.. A business man recieved this letter and threw it away..not believing in it.. and he lost everything he had within 13 days.. It reached a labourer and he distributed it to 13 people.. he was promoted and all his problems were solved within 13 days.. So you must send this e mail to 13 people for something good to happen to you (inshallah) so people..get sending !! :) dont be lazy. ---- (An image of the letter in Arabic was below this) ---- -----Example Ends Here ----- A similar one came before regarding a saint from Saudi Arabia, having a dream. I have been told my numerous friends, that it is sinful, and happens often on the internet. What is the fatwa reagding the sending of these types of Emails. For the sake of others, could you please give some concrete evidence as to why it is wrong, if it is.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSuch chain letters are nothing new to us. Such letters are utter fabrications and should therefore be ignored. Benefit and harm lies solely in the hands of Allah. He has already predestined what is in store for us. Instead of relying on reports of dreams, let us focus on the realities of life instead.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Moulana Emraan Vawda"
