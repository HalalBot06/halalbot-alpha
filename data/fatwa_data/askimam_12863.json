  "question": "Comsumption of alcohol is haraam, but are other products eg. lotions, shampoos, perfumes, medication, which contain alcohol?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nyour answers to alcoholic perfumes do not make sense to me because, everything that is haraam has a perfect reason for being haraam, pigs are haraam because they are disgusting animals ie. they eat their own faeces, tapeworms etc., stealing is haraam because it is morally wrong, cigarettes intoxicate, drugs intoxicate, CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL intoxicates, but products containing alcohol does not affect us in any way! That is why I feel your reasoning behind perfumes are wrong, if not, prove it with authentic verses to convince me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou are correct. There is always a reason for anything being Haraam. The principle basis for anything being Haraam is Qur?aan and Hadith, and deduction of the Fuqahaa (Jurists).\n\nThe prohibition of alcohol is not confined to being an intoxicant. It is also the element of impurity in it. A pig is impure, faeces are impure. One will abstain from that. Shari?ah has also declared pure alcohol as impure.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
