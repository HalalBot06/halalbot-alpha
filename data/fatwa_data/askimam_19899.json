  "question": "Does my husband nullify my ablution (Wudu)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear brother,i just want to know if my husband brakes my WUDU?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ῾alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nYour question is not clear. What do you mean by your husband breaking your Wudu? It appears you wish to query the concept of Masse Imr῾ah, i.e., husband touching the wife while she is in the state of Wudu.\n\nDoes the touching break the wife’s Wudu or not?\n\nIf this is your intended query then according to the Hanafi School of thought (Mazhab) husband touching his wife does not invalidate Wudu.\n\n\nAnd Allah Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n \nMufti Zaid M Shelia,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\nChicago, Illinois (USA)\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
