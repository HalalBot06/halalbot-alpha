  "question": "What does Islam say about Cloning. What are the reasons to why isn't allowed?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHUMAN CLONING%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Western World is continuously looking for ways and means of making%0D%0Astrides in the field of Science and Technology. In their attempts to make%0D%0Astrides in this field, they tend to conveniently turn a blind eye to the%0D%0Areligious and cultural sentiments of the various nations of the world. In%0D%0Atheir euphoria of so-called scientific progress, they are wont to trample%0D%0Aupon the honour and dignity of the human race. At the same time, the Western%0D%0AWorld's machinery of propaganda with their control over the mass media, is%0D%0Abusy indocrinating many Eastern Bloc countries into accepting their weird%0D%0Adogmas and ideals. It would thus not be an exaggeration to say that the%0D%0Adevious ways of the West have not remained restricted to the geographical%0D%0Aboundaries of the West but that these ways have become an ideology%0D%0Apermeating through every comer of the world, making it a global threat.%0D%0ANow, fresh from the stables of Western mentality comes the advent of%0D%0A'cloning'. The successful cloning of Dolly the sheep by a Dr Ian Wilmut of%0D%0Athe Roslin Institute in Scotland has raised hopes in many Medical and%0D%0AScientific circles of the possibility of successful human cloning.%0D%0AADVANTAGES?%0D%0AThe proponents of human cloning are already citing so called 'advantages' of%0D%0Ahuman cloning. For instance, they claim that success in this field will be a%0D%0Agreat boon for those childless couples who have lost hope in acquiring%0D%0Achildren of their own. In fact, hopes have been raised to the extent that,%0D%0Aaccording to the Johannesburg Muslim Doctor who recently made headlines on%0D%0Athe cloning issue, cloning may even succeed for those couples who have%0D%0Afailed to acquire children through artificial insemination.%0D%0AAs far as the Shar? aspect is concerned, my humble view is that cloning%0D%0Ashould NOT be permitted and should be totally outlawed. In spite of the fact%0D%0Athat it could be beneficial (such as in the case of childless couples), the%0D%0Aharm far outweigh its benefits. Some of the factors that would render it%0D%0Aprohibited would be the following:%0D%0A1. Cloning would become nothing short of a commercial venture. Already plans%0D%0Aare afoot in some Western countries such as America to clone past superior%0D%0Arace-horses so that the gambling and racing industry remain abuzz with these%0D%0Afast horses for decades to come and the tatterstalls continue to generate%0D%0AHaraam business. (Monthly Al-Haqq, vol. 32 No. 7 - Zhul Hijjah 1417%2FApril%0D%0A1997 issue). As Western mentality is programmed to concoct weird ideas, one%0D%0Amay see efforts directed next towards cloning film stars in order to draw%0D%0Apacked houses to the box-office and thereby keep promiscuity and%0D%0Apermissiveness fully ingrained in the passions of the gullible public.%0D%0ASimilar attempts could be made with regard to cloning sports stars.%0D%0AFEATURES%0D%0A2. Generic Engineering, which is basically interfering with the creation of%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala, will be closely linked to cloning. The Johannesburg Muslim%0D%0ADoctor explained to us that this would entail couples being able to make the%0D%0Adecision of WHAT TYPE of children they would like to get. With Generic%0D%0AEngineering, the Cell Tissue extracted from the couple could be manipulated%0D%0Ain a way whereby the couple would be able to decide to have a%0D%0Alight-complexioned or dark-complexioned child, a blue-eyed or green-eyed%0D%0Achild, a blonde-haired or dark-haired child and so on. We can well imagine%0D%0Awhat chaos this would cause in that when the child will NOT resemble the%0D%0Aparents, people would begin to accuse the child's mother of having perhaps%0D%0Acommitted adultery with a man having THOSE features, because the child does%0D%0Anot resemble its father.%0D%0A3. When cloning will become commonplace, cell-tissue banks will be%0D%0Aestablished and people will begin to sell their tissues to these banks which%0D%0Awill result in the sale of human tissue, which is prohibited.%0D%0A4. People will buy cell tissue for infusing into women, not knowing whose%0D%0Atissue it is. This would create a great deal of confusion in establishing%0D%0Afamily lineage, siblings, etc. and even result in brothers getting married%0D%0Ato sisters without realising it.%0D%0AIn short, cloning could pose a great global threat to the very ideals of%0D%0Ahuman society and cause mayhem and pandemonium in many respects.%0D%0APractically, all religious denominations have taken note of the evils%0D%0Ainherent in this practice, which is why they have all condemned it. In the%0D%0Amost recent issue of 'Al-Balagh' (Darul Ulum, Karachi monthly), Hadhrat%0D%0AMufti Taqi Uthmaani (Mudda Zilluhu) has, in his report-back of the annual%0D%0AFiqh Academy Conference, written that the issue of cloning was also%0D%0Adiscussed at the Conference and all the delegates present had unanimously%0D%0Adeclared cloning to be prohibited.%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Saeed Motara Saheb%0D%0A%0D%0A"
