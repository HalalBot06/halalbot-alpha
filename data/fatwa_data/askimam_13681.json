  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease could you advise me if a person missed a fast deliberatelyfor 3 or 4 days (not due to ill health etc) then is that Kaffara or can they fast for those days after ramadan(ie3 to 4 days).\n\nIf it is Kaffarah and they are unable to keep these due to their work enviroment and do a sincere tauba and wish to to feed someone for 60 days then do they have to financially provide for the equivualent of three/four days(each day missed)(i.e 1 day missed 60 days and therefore: 4 days X 60 = 240 days) or just provide Kaffarah once for 60 days and do a sincere tauba?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf a person did not fast in Ramadhaan, then only Qadhaa (make up) for the missed fasts is compulsory. If one missed four fasts, then only four fasts will have to be kept. The person should also make Tawbah and repent.\n\nKaffaarah is only if one kept a fast and broke the fast without a valid excuse in Shari’ah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
