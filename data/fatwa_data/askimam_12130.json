  "question": "My mother passed away leaving some property etc. behind. Please help us determine each of her relative's shares.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nShe left 1 husband, 4 Sons, 5 Daughters, 2 Sisters, 1 Brother and no parents. She did not have any debts. Who should be responsible for the administrative fee(s), local & federal government taxes incurred whilst transferring the property to those who have inherited? If there are any shares of a company that need to be transferred it incurs a lot of expense here in Pakistan. Who would be responsible for bearing the expense of transfer of shares of a deceased person to those who inherit? Please make Duaa for her & everyone who died as a Muslim, to Allah Ta√£la that He may ease all the \"Mannazzil\" that every human being has to go through after leaving this world permanently. Jazak Allah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe nett estate will be divided into fifty two (52) equal shares. The husband will inherit 13 shares, each son will inherit 6 shares and each daughter will inherit 3 shares. The brothers and sisters will not inherit.\n\nThe cost of transferring the inherited property will be borne by the inheritor. The cost of these will not be deducted from the nett estate.\n\nMay Allah grant your mother and all the deceased Muslim Jannatul Firdos. Ameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
