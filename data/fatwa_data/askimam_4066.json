  "question": "Is it better for a husband and wife to offer their Fard Salaat in Jamaat rather than individually, so that they may get additional reward?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf so, please explain how far back does the woman has to stand behind the man?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is compulsory upon a male to perform Salaat with Jamaat in the Musjid. If\nhe has a valid excuse for not doing so, he will be excused.\n\nIn such a situation, he may perform Salaat with Jamaat with his wife. It\nsuffices that she does not stand in line with him.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
