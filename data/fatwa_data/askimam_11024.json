I mean.. Nikah Over Nikah, since we canot declare our marriage at this point of life...we Both are feeling sorry over all this we did.. and praying to GOD to forgive us..and hoping to do Niakh next time we meet. We both have changed our life styles according so shariah as husband and wife..... please advise as we both are worried for this...Thanks.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe mutual understanding and acceptance between you and the girl to be husband and wife without performing a Nikah is incorrect and therefore not married according to the Shari?ah.\n\nThe relationship was an adulterous one. If both of you continue with the relationship, it will still be an adulterous relationship which is Haraam (strictly prohibited). We advise that both of you repent to Allah and terminate your relationship. If both of you wish to be married, then perform Nikah according to the Shari?ah. Your changed lifestyle according to the Shari?ah will then be appreciated by Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
