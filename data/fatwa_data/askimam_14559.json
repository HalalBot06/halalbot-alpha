It is not possible to control this liquid and it comes out in most fertile days. Please tell me should I change my cloth before performing prayer. I am married and I try my best not to bring any sexual thought.I am also doing job and it is not possible for me to change my cloth\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe emission of liquid will be regarded as impure.
