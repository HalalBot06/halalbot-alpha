  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn educating children,I always believed to use the gentle approach as there are lots of nas urging muslims to be gentle(rafiqa).However a friend of mine disagree.He says the harsh approach is good also so that the person is being shook up to change.In Islam there are also many instances when the harsh approach is used,e.g. the boycott incident after Tabuk ghazwah.Also Saidina Omar is a harsh person.Is he right? What are the situations where it is better to be harsh than gentle?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe disagree that Sayyiduna Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) was harsh. He was stern\nbut not harsh.\n\nAll children and all circumstances cannot be dealt in the same light. The\ngeneral approach to children should be one of gentleness and compassion.\nHowever, in some circumstances, sterness and a strict approach is required.\nThis applies when the child is stubborn or rude. This is something which the\nparent has to tune into. He must get a good understanding of his children,\nand be able to recognize when the child is being stubborn. In such cases, he\nshould sternly discipline the child. This stern will only be effective if\nthe child is given compassion when he co-operates. The approach is both a\nstick and carrot technique.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
