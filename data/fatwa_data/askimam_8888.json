  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) If I propose to a girl for marriage and she accepts and we writ it down on a piece of paper, decide on the Maher, the two adult sane witnesses are there and they sign the piece of paper as well, and then I give them a treat as a waleema so is this marriage acceptable in Islam? (2) Is the method of Istikhara accepted, when a person reads Surah-e-Fathia 1 time, then Al-Iqlas 3 times and then Durud Shareef 15 times, then recites the Dua of Istikhara having the intention of doing the thing, holds the tasbih in the left hand from any spot and moves a beat at a time, reciting Laillahaillalah, Subhanallah, Allhamdullilah one by one and if the last beat ends with Alhamdullilah he shall do what he intended to do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1.
