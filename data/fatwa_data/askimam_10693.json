  "answer": "QUESTION\nWell dont know why but i feel that i am goin away from allah.I was always into prayers before i came to australia.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou state that you cannot perform five times Salaat and you cannot concentrate.%0D%0A%0D%0ATo perform five times Salaat is Fardh. Concentration in Salaat is the essence of Salaat. Allah Ta?ala does not give an order that cannot be carried out. If one is unable to carry out an order, that is due to some shortcoming within him. You should look within yourself and ponder on that shortcoming the reason of you not being able to perform your five times Salaat. You know your shortcoming better than we do. Prescription for medication is upon diagnosis. However, if the reason is just laziness, then you have to fight against it. You have to bring the courage and strength to be able to perform Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou will never be able to eat food or drink water without courage. Just as you fight that to feed yourself, you have to do so to feed your spirituality. Abstinence from sins is also a cause for unmindfulness. We make Du?aa to Allah that He grant us all the roohaniyyah to fulfil His orders.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
