  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have a really good friend to whom when I meet, we end up watching movies. Other friends are ok. I can refuse to watch movies with them but this one friend. He prays 5 times and he's good but he doesn't believe in giving up movies and similar desires. Can you give a suggestion.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala has blessed you with a little bit of understanding as to the\nimportance of having good friends. A true friend is one who will always see\nto the good and well-being of oneself.\n\nRather than waiting for your friends to be good to you, you should try to be\na 'true friend' towards them. Refusing to watch movies with the other\nfriends is not enough. You should use some sort of skill and tactic to try\nnot to let any of your friends watch movies. May be you can create an\nexcuse, at the time when they intend to watch movies, to go elsewhere - some\nother place which they will also enjoy - may be playing cricket, soccer or\nvisit a nearby restaurant and have a meal together. We suggest that you use\nsome sort of excuse - not only to keep yourself away, but also to encourage\nall your friends to be away from the 'movie' environment.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
