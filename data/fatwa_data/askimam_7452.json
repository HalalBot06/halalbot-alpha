If the time for Jamaat to commence is short and allows you to perform two Rakaats Tahiyyatul Masjid only, you may perform two Rakaats Tahiyyatul Masjid. You should perform the 4 Rakaats of Dhuhr Sunnah Salaat after the Fardh Salaat.\n\n2. If a non-Muslim is sincerely interested in Islam and wants to read the translation and commentary of the Qur'aan, he/she should be advised to respect the Qur'aan by washing before touching the Qur'aan and keeping the Qur'aan with respect.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
