  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Is it permisable for women to go to gay male hair-dressers, beauticians, clothing designers or to get body piecings done (etc) (by gays) & remove hijaab in front of them? Can men go to beauticians etc? 2. Can husband and wife wear each others clothes? Example, tee-shirts, jackets, sweaters, jeans etc that are unisex.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In principle, it is not permissible for females to go to any Ghayr Mahrahm male without a reason acceptable in Shari?ah. The reasons explained in the details does not fall in the category of need. Furthermore, it is inconceivable that a Muslim will have anything to do with a gay.\n\n2. In principle, a husband may wear the clothes of his wife and vice versa which are not exclusively for the opposite gender.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
