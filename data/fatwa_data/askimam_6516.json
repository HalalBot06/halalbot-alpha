  "question": "1) my mother does not even want to meet him, saying that we belong to two different regions in pakistan and our culture would not be compatible.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a muslima 20 years of age. And I need advice on how to get my mothers permission on the following two situations: 1) I am interested in a brother, and so is he. Our families know, his family is wiling to meet mine. However my mother does not even want to meet him, saying that we belong to two different regions in pakistan and our culture would not be compatible. 2) I want to start doing hijab, however my mother does not give me permission. Before she asked me to show her convincing literature on doing hijab. After I did that she brought up other excuses. She says I would not get any mariage proposals and that I want to do hijab to go against my mothers wishes. My dad supports me and have tried to talk to my mother a lot of times. But everytime i plan on starting, she becomes mad at me and gets ill. So eventually I have to postpone. I want to know the ahadith and ayas I can quote to my parents. What rights of decion making do I have in the above mentioned cases over my parents. Is there any dua I can recite to overcome their stubborness.And am I allowed to disobey my mother for doing hijab, as I beleive it is fard on a muslima?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Your mother wants the best for you. Although she cannot legally prohibit\nyou from marrying this man, you should follow her advice. She wants you to\navoid a cultural clash in the future. It is rather difficult for members of\ndivergent cultures to live amicably and peacefully together.\n2. To adhere to Islamic law, you do not require the permission of your\nmother. Your first and foremost allegiance lies with Allah. If she prohibits\nyou from an injunction of Shari'ah, you should disobey her and adhere to the\ncommandments of the Shari'ah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
