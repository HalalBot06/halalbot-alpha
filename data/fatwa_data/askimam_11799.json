  "question": "When passing faeces, if that water splashes on you (in a western style toilet), is ghusl compulsory? Does looking at oneâ€™s private parts break wudu?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The water from the pan is impure. One should adopt a method in avoiding the water splashing on oneself. If the water splashes on oneself, then the area must be washed. It is not necessary to take a Ghusl.\n\n2. Looking at one?s private parts does not invalidate the Wudhu.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
