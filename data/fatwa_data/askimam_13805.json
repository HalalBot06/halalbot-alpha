  "question": "Why the Hanafees don't pray 2 rakat before Maghrib?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhy the Hanafees don't pray 2 rakat before Maghrib?\n\nAbdullah ibn Muqaffal (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Perform two Rakaats before Maghrib Salaat.' He mentioned this three times and the third time he said, 'whosoever wishes.' (the narrator said Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said this) fearing people make the two Rakaats Sunnah.'  (Mishkaat pg.104; Qadeemi)\n\nIn view of the above, the majority of the Fuqahaa besides have ruled that it is Mustahabb (desirable) to perform two Rakaats before Maghrib Salaat. Please provide reasons and prooves of the Hanafees for not performing it.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAlthough the narration that you have cited is authentic, there are many authentic narrations to the contrary. The narration of Muslim clearly establishes that Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] himself never performed this Salaat. In the narration of Abu Dawud, ibn Umar [radhiallaahu anhu] mentions that he never saw anyone in the time of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] performing this Salaat. There are also narrations proving that illustrious Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhu] such as Abu Bakr and Umar did not perform this Salaat.\n\nIn the light of the above, together with the many narrations that prove that Maghrib Salaat should be hastened after sunset and should not be delayed (Makrooh to do so). This Salaat is Makrooh according to the Hanafi Madhab. However, if there is already a delay in Maghrib Salaat beyond one’s control, i.e. not intentionally delaying Maghrib, it is permissible to perform 2 Rakaats.
