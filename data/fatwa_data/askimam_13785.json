  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI need to know can we that place where they sell pork\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is most definitely not adisable for a believer to work in a place that sells pork. One should try to leave this job and acquire his livelihood through non-dubious sources.\n\nThe Mas-alah will nonetheless be that if more than half of the companyâ€™s income is through Halaal sources, it will be permissible to work for them, otherwise not. Over and above this, it is completely impermissible to work for such a company and be directly involved in the selling of pork. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyah vol.5 pg.105)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
