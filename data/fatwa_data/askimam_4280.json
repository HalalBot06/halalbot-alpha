  "question": "Is a student with study loans with jewelry sitting idle obligated to pay Zakaat on this jewelry and how so?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs-salaamu 'alaikum wa Rahmat-Allah wa Barakaatahu I'm currently a student with student loans. However, I have some jewelry sitting idle; am I to pay Zakaat on this jewelry and if so, how is it calculated, taking the loans into account? Does this also apply to clothes which have not yet been given away as a Sadaqah? Jazaak Allahu khairan for sharing your time and knowledge.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the loan amount exceeds the value of the gold jewellery, then there is no\nzakaat on the jewellery. If the value of the jewellery is in excess of the\nloan amount and is equivalent to the minimum zakaatable amount then only\nzakaat will be due on the jewellery. You may contact your local Muslim\norganisation for the minimum zakaatable amount.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
