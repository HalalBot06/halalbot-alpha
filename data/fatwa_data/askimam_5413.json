  "question": "Is it ok to keep two names?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIt is fashionable to keep two names, a first an second name. Is this ok?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlthough it is permissible to do so, such was not the practice of Nabi\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and his Sahaabah (Radhiallaahu Anhu), thus it\nis not the ideal. Furthermore, it is noticed that people usually become\naccustomed to one of the names, thereby neglecting the second.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
