Is that true that she still has to make qadha for the fasting that she have missed besides she also has to make kafarat (give the food to poor people based on how many day she have missed the fasting).\n\n3. There are alot of chirstian spreading around the world, can we call them as \"Ahlul Kitaab\" ? If we they are ahlul kitaab, does it mean that muslim man can marry christian woman or jew woman ? And is that halal for us to eat the meat that is sloughter by non muslim people?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The overriding principle for the Salaat of a woman is the aspect of Tasattur, i.e. her Salaat should be performed in such a manner that her bodily figure and shape is hidden (concealed) to the best of her ability. Apart from the face, hands and feet, the rest of her body must be covered. Women should cover themselves properly using a sheet/Burqah and loose fitting dresses/cloaks so that their head, neck, arms, shoulders, thighs and shins are covered. She should only raise her hands upto her shoulders for Takbeer-e-Tahrima (it should be done from within the Burqah). The hands should be placed on the chest by placing the right palm over the left, keeping the fingers close together. In Ruku, women should only bow down slightly, just enough for the hands to touch the knees. Her fingers should be kept together and placed on the knees. The knees should be bent slightly and elbows must be tucked in her sides. In Sajda, her fingers and toes should face the Qiblah. She should contract herself completely by making her thighs touch her stomach, her arms should touch her sides and she should take her legs out to the right hand side. Her arms and elbows should be on the ground. The sitting posture should be such that she must sit on her left buttock, take the feet out to the right and keep the right thigh on the left thigh. Her feet should be kept horizontal and not erect. Her hands should be kept on her thighs with her feet close together. In attahiyaat, she should raise the index finger of her right hand slightly when saying ‘ash-hadu’ and return it to its normal state at ‘illallaah’. The woman and man are same in all the other aspects of Salaat. (Qudwatul hasana)\n\n2. A woman should hasten in completing her Qadhaa fast as soon as possible. If she was unable to complete her Qadhaa fast until the next Ramadhaan, then she must make only Qadhaa after Ramadhaan. No Kaffaarah will become necessary.\n\n3. If the Ahlul kitaab slaughter Halaal animal by taking the name of Allah, it will be permissible to consume such animals.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
