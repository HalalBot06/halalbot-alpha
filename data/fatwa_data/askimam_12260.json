  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it true that muslims believe that man was created around 5000 B.C. based on the chronology of the prophets? A friend of mine was confused after hearing this given that fossils have been discovered that are much older than that (millions of years old).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe information that man was created at around 5000 BC is not true. Nobody knows the exact age of man on earth. That is best known by Allah Alone.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
