  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI went to Jamaat in India.  We firstly went to Nizamuddin.  From there out Tashkeel was done to Madras for 25 days.\n\nWhen we got to Madras Marqas, our route was made in Madras.  Madras is a very big city with different areas.  Each Mosque is quite a few kilometeres away, as they sent us in different areas of Madras.\n\nAre we counted as Musafirs.  Some people in the Jamaat stated that because Madras was a big city, and we were going to different areas, we would be musafirs - I was unsure about this.\n\nCan you please clarify.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to the laws of Safar (travelling) since you will be moving from locality to locality, you will remain a Musafir (traveller). You will not become a Muqeem (temporary resident).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
