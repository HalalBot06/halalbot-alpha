  "question": "can a pregnant woman fast during the month of Ramadhan?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n can a pregnant woman fast during the month of Ramadhan?\n\nAs you said that after during the intercourse one should wash the private parts, then can a person pray his/her prayers or is it very important to take shower? Please answer my above questions.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1.      A pregnant woman is exempted from fasting the month of Ramadhaan. If she does not fast, she has to make Qadhaa (make up) for the missed fasts. If she chooses to fast during pregnancy, she may do so.\n\n \n\n2.      In order for Salaat to be valid after intercourse, one must make Ghusl. That is wash the entire body, rinse the mouth and nostrils.\n\n \n\n \n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
