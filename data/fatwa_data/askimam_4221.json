  "question": "Assalaam-Aliakum, I would like to know whether wudu (ablution) is valid if done with nail polish on.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have always done my wudu and prayed without wearing nail polish. But some of my friends always said that its okay to wear nail polish and pray. Although I always belived that wudu is invalid if done with nail polish but now I just wanted to makesure. I would highly appreciate your help regarding this matter. Thankyou. Kudha-hafiz\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn order for wudhu to be valid, water must reach the surface of the nails.\nThat does not take place with nail polish on the nails. The polish prevents\nthe water from reaching the surface of the nails, therefore, the wudhu will\nbe invalid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.p"
