  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCommiting a crime\n\nIf some1 commited a really big crime, such as shooting some1 and killin them, will allah ever forgive them on 'the day of judgement if them still asked forgiveness from him???'\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah Ta’ala created man and Jinn for his worship. Allah Ta’ala states, ‘I have created man and Jinn solely for my worship.’\n\nWe have to obey the commandments of Allah and stay away from what Allah has prohibited, then the object of life will be fulfilled and a person will attain entry into Jannah, Insha Allah. At the same time, man has been created weak and at times is overcome by his desires which result in him breaking the commands of Allah and disobeying his creator. Allah Ta’ala loves his creation and therefore is ready to forgive man whenever he disobeys him. Even though it may be a hundred times, provided he seeks Allah’s pardon with sincerity. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has been reported to have said that Allah Ta’ala states, ‘If the sins of my slave reach the sky, then he sincerely repents to me, I will forgive all his sins and this will not matter to me.’ (Tirmidhi Hadith3540)\n\nTherefore, the amount of sins committed or the severity of any sin should not deter a person from seeking forgiveness from Almighty Allah. For Allah is most forgiving and he loves those who repent and seek forgiveness. Allah states, ‘O my slaves who have transgressed against themselves, despair not of the mercy of Allah. Verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, he is oft forgiving, most merciful.’\n\nOne should never lose hope in the mercyof Allah, rather one should turn to Allah with full sincerity and remorse for committing the sin and with the resolution never to commit the sin again. Most definitely, Allah will forgive one. It is mentioned in the Hadith that Allah forgave a person who killed 100 people and then made a firm intention to seek Allah’s forgiveness, and while proceeding passed away. Even if a person committed the biggest crime 100 times, the doors of Allah’s forgiveness are still open. He should turn and repent to Allah before it is too late.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
