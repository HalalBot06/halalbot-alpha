  "question": "I accepted a guy my husband without witnesses but just Allah, and he accepted me as a wife.....",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nQ.1: I accepted a guy my husband without witnesses but just Allah, and he accepted me as a wife. That guy has no strong belief in Allah and the life after death (roz-e-kayamat); he calls himself agnostic. With his confession, he put the condition that if I ever have any contact with my former male friends then this relationship will be over. He could not own me socially but enjoyed with me physically. We did not have sex but on his insistence, we had oral. After one and a half year, he said the relationship is all over because of my accidental meeting with one of my old male friend. He repeated the same for thrice at least that “it’s over.” Even during the relationship, he asked to end up with the relationship because it’s kind of fake one or is not realistic. Once he said talaaq twice together too during that time. My Question is, according to this situation, was I his wife? He has said talaaq as the third and the last one later after 6 months of ending up relationship. If that relationship was true then is that talaaq valid or the way it was said? What about iddah while no sex took place?\n\n \n\n \n\nQ.2: If a man and woman accept each other as a husband and wife in the name of Allah repeating the words three times but no witnesses and without parents’ permission, then is it a valid nikah?\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf we assume the person is a muslim, then too the Nikah with him was not valid. One of the conditions for the validity of the Nikah is to be witnessed by 2 muslim males or 1 muslim male and 2 muslim females. Your relationship with the person was a haram one and a major sin. You should make tawba (repent) and adhere to the Shariah Laws of Hijab and purdah\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
