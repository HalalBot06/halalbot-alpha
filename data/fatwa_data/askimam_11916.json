  "question": "is online ads business or medical transcriptions halaal",
  "answer": "QUESTION\ni have seen some online businesses like online marketing and medical transcriptions. the detail of the business is that if you get into a deal with some hospital in america or some other western country. they send you the reports of their patients in audio format . you download them and type them into a particular text report and send them back. for every report they pay you some fixed amount of money in dollars. in this way they get cheap labor and as they pay in US dollars we can have the advantage of the exchange rate. similar is the business of online ads. (client sends you ads in audio, and you send text) my question is that are these ways of earning halaal. if there are any possible scenarios whree such an earning may not be right please mention them Jazakallah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe online business of medical transcriptions is permissible. This falls in the category of ijaarah (hiring).\n\nThe terms of reference must be absolutely clear without any ambiguity whatsoever. If there is any ambiguity in the terms of reference that may lead to a confusion or dispute, then it will not be permissible. The online ads transcriptions will be permissible only if the business is Shari?ah compliant. If the business is not Shari?ah compliant, it is not permissible to assist in transcription such ads.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
