  "question": "Can i marry my wifes younger sister. If not why? What is the shariah ruling if i am already in nikah to this person?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy intention is to look after my wifes sister by making nikah to her as she is quite of a tender age and she is an orphan. Also to safeguard her from giong astray, not for any lustful or carnal desires and alhmd i am in a position wherein i can comfortably support both sisters. Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlmighty Allah Ta'ala enumerates all the women that are Haram (strictly\nprohibited) upon an individual. One is joining two sisters in marriage.\n\nIf one marries his wife's sister, the marriage will be invalid. It is\ncompulsory upon you to keep your distance from your wife's sister. She has\nto adhere to the laws of Hijaab in your presence. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu\nAlayhi Wasallam) said, 'The brother-in-law is death.'\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
