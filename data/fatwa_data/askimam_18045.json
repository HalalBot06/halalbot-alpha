  "question": "Test tube babies",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am Alhamdolillah happily married for 2,5 years now and still have no childrens. My question: is test tube babies allowed in Islam (hanafi madhab) and in which circumstances.\n\nWe have consulted a lot of doctors, and my wife had ultra scans as well. There seem to be nothing wong. But the pressure of our familes are mounting.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh.\n\n \n\nIt should be understood that Allah Ta’ala in his absolute knowledge and wisdom has created every person differently. A person can supersede others in one aspect whilst he falls short in another. Similarly, Allah Ta’ala bestows some people with many children whilst he renders others barren. It is mentioned in the Holy Qurān:\n\n لله ملك السماوات والأرض يخلق ما يشاء يهب لمن يشاء إناثا ويهب لمن يشاء الذكور - أو يزوجهم ذكرانا وإناثا ويجعل من يشاء عقيما إنه عليم قدير (الشورى 49-50)  \n\n“To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and earth. He creates whatever he wishes. He bestows female (offspring) to whomsoever he wishes and bestows male (offspring) to whomsoever he wishes. Or he grants both male and female and he renders barren whomsoever he wishes. Verily, he is All-Knowing and has the power to do anything. (Ash Shurā, verse 49-50)\n\nSince there is nothing wrong with your spouse, the ideal would be, not to interfere with the natural system of Allah Ta’ala and rather resort to Dua and Istighfaar. Inshā’allah, if it is destined for you to have children Allah Ta’ala will soon make it a reality.\n\nHowever, if there is extreme difficulty in conceiving naturally and the couple are determined on bearing their own child, some Ulama have given permissibility to do so with the following conditions:\n\n·         Only the semen of the husband should be used. It will not be permissible to use the semen of a man other than the husband.\n\n·         Both the husband and wife should be treated by doctors of their respective gender. \n\n·         There should be certainty in the sperm being that of the husband and no one else. \n\n\nPlease refer to the following link for more detail.\n\n\nhttp://www.askimam.org/fatwa/fatwa.php?askid=ab72db77cb846f2be1365534779e9788\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
