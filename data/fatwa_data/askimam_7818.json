  "question": "Can I look at the photograph of my mankoha? We have not had khalwah and I had to leave the country after nikah but inshaAllah we will be together soon.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAlhamdolillah I recently got married in Pakistan but there was no khalwah. I am back in USA right now. I delayed khalwah as I could not bring my wife with me instantly as she has to get a visa. InshaAllah I will go back soon to bring her over. I could not see my wife well as there were people around us and I could not bring myself to look at her in the presence of others except for a few glances. Her image is very vague in my mind. She did not see me at all. Would it be OK if we looked at each other's photographs? Alhamdolillah there was no photography during the marriage but we do have pictures (e.g. taken for passport etc). Alhamdolillah getting married has focused my mind and given me alot of \"sukoon\" even though we have'nt spent any time together. We talk on the phone but looking at photographs might increase the bonding and it would be easier for us when we meet inshaAllah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible to look at your wifes photograph in order to increase the bond with her.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
