  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni have read the shitie belief over Khilafat issue at your web. some questions aorse in my mind kindly answer.\n\n1- If some ansar and muhajirin were that much concerned about Khilafat then the burriel arrangements of thier beloved Rasool then how we can say them true muslim because i think the burriel was more important then to appointment of khalifa at once and without any suggestion of majority.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n-         The appointment of the Khalifah was, at that point, more important than the burial.\n\n-         Also, whilst the dispute over the next Khalifah continued, some Sahabah were engaged in the burial arrangements.\n\n-         Furthermore, the immediate appointment of the Khalifah was vital so as to prevent fitnah (social turmoil) within the Ummah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best"
