  "question": "If I am forced to take an oath against my will is it valid and if so, can I break that oath?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI wanted to ask you a question concerning oaths:\n\n1.) If someone is forced to take an oath against their will, is this oath valid?\n\n2.) If this oath is valid, can we break this oath, and will Allah, who is Al-Ghaffar, forgive me for doing so, for this oath was taken under oppression and forced onto the person against his will.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\n1.) When a person declares in one of the Names of Allah or one of His Attributes or on the Quran to do something or to leave something, then such a statement is considered a valid oath.\n\nFor example, a person says: “I swear by Allah to do such and such” or “I swear on the Quran to leave such and such.”\n\nWhile both of the above are examples of valid and binding oaths, one should avoid taking oaths on the Quran as it is not appropriate to do so.\n\nIt is only appropriate to take an oath in one of the Names of Allah or one of His Attributes.\n\nEven if one is forced into taking such an oath against his will, the oath will still be valid and binding.\n\nHowever, if the one being forced to take an oath makes an ambiguous statement instead, while intending something else in order to save himself from oppression, the oath will then be according to what he intended and not according to the apparent statement he made.\n\nIf an oath is taken in someone else's name, then such an oath is not valid nor is any kaffārah (penalty) due. For example, a person says “I swear by my mother I will not do this”. This is not a valid oath.\n\nActing contrary to such a statement will not render a kaffārah (penalty). However, it is a major sin to take an oath in someone else's name and one should abstain from it at all times.\n\n\n2.) Breaking a valid oath (as defined above) that one was forced to take will necessitate a kaffārah (penalty).\n\nThe kaffārah for breaking an oath is the feeding of ten needy persons twice a day for one day or providing them clothing. If one is not financially able to feed or clothe them then he must fast for 3 days in continuous succession instead. [i] [ii] [iii] [iv] [v]\n\nThe mercy of Allah is vast and Insha-Allah he will forgive you. As believers we are never despondent of being forgiven by Him.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMl.
