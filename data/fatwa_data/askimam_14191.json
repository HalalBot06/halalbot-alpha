  "question": "what is the proof for it being not permissible as they are passing time.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nQ1)I am a university student.\n\nOn campus, many muslim students male and female play thunee and other card games sometimes for the whole day,Â  When someone tells them it is not permissible to do so, they say there is no money involved and what is the proof for it being not permissible as they are passing time.\n\nCould you please advise me on this issue and give some proofs for it being not permissible\n\nQ2) The Islamic society wants to mhave video screenings about islam and topical issues such as 9/11 etc. for muslim and non-muslim students. Is this permissible. They also want to have open jumas where non-muslims will be allowed to mcome to the jamaat khana and see what is happening. Males and females will be completely segregated. Is this allowed.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is Makrooh (disliked) to play cards etc. as it is associated with many immoralities. It is known that those engrossed in such games become oblivious of their duties towards Allah and tend to neglect their responsibilities. Apart from this, once a person masters the pros and cons of the game, he becomes confident of himself and begins to compete in higher competitions which include gambling. Therefore, it is advisable to abstain from playing such games and make use of the time in a more constructive and meaningful way.\n\nThere are two issues A) permissibility of screening a video B) Objective.\n\nAccording to Shariah, it is prohibited to take pictures of animate objects. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has issued grave warnings for those who take pictures of animate objects. Therefore, it is not permissible to screen video for Muslims and non Muslims. An Islamic Society should be an organization that portrays true Islam and Deen. This organizations in the university should not be as other student movements that are formed for ulterior motives. The Islamic Society must have dedicated Muslim students that are committed to Deen and are motivated by the fear of Allah. Until such members are not part of the Society, such an organization can never become a means of others gaining Hidaayat and finding the straight path. In order for other students to be convinced about Islam, it is the responsibility of the Islamic Society and its affiliates to project true Islam and be practical. Attending certain programmes and Jumma is not sufficient. Then what is the difference between us Muslims and other religious organizations. They also attend their places of worship once or twice a week. We therefore implore you and your associates to consider this advise and try to change the mindset of the Muslim students first. If there is an Islamic renaissance, this alone will attract other students and you will be used as a means of other students Hidaayat (guidance). Programmes of pomp and glory for a few hours do not yield and constructive benefit but only becomes an entertainment for all participants and everyone returns with nothing to ponder over.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai\nFor: Darul Ifta"
