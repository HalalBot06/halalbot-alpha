An adult is not bound to follow the\nfamily custom. He/she may do so if he/she wish to.\n\nIt is not proper for the elders of the family to compel one to go against\nhis/her wishes within the Shari'ah. We also advise that Nikah is a major\nstep in one's life and it is important to make Istikhaara as well as seek\nthe guidance and experience of one's seniors.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
