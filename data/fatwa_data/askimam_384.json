  "question": "Is it permissible to pray with the hands down to one's side during theentire Naamaz like the Muslims of West Africa?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo place the hands on the side is the view of some prominent Fuqahaa,\nincluding Imaam Maalik ibn Anas Maalik. A Maaliki (follower of the Maaliki\nMadhab) only should follow the ruling of his Imaam. Followers of other\nMadhaahib, for example, Hanafi, Shaaf'ee, Hanbaliy should follow the ruling\nof their Imaams by tying their hands during Qiyaam (standing posture).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
