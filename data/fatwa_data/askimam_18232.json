  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs zakat to be paid on all income even if it is necessary income?\n\nWhat can a woman do if a man sexually abused her many years ago and left her with all his problems while he went on to a new life and everyone was pleased with him?  Sometimes Islam these days isn't fair to women who stay away from the evils of other women like gossip.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nZakaat in general has to be paid on a year to year basis. A person will calculate his assets, deduct his expenses and discharge the zakaat at the end of the lunar year. The reason for this is that a persons assets and liabilities fluctuate. The amount a person paid the previous year will not be the same as the current year, therefore zakaat is calculated annually. We understand from your query that “necessary income” refers to your basic day to day salary which is used for your household needs, necessities and livelihood. If this is correct then it will be necessary for you to determine whether the surplus is equal or more than the nisaab (minimum stipulated nisaab for zakaat). If the extra cash amounts to nisaab and one year has passed on that money, then zakah will be necessary.\n\n(Contemporary Fataawa Pg 79 Idara Islamiat)\n\nIndeed the religion of Islam is perfect and most just. Nabi (SallallahuAlaihi Wasallam) showed us the pristine way of life towards eternal paradise. It is now our duty as muslims to follow these guidelines in order to be successful.\n\nIt is important to remedy the situation by confronting such avenues which are at your disposal. Firstly, you have done nothing wrong so there is no need to attribute default and deficiency to yourself. Whenever faced with a crisis never keep it in as it builds up into a bigger crisis, rather speak out your problems. Perhaps you may feel comfortable speaking to some elders/seniors in your family. Sometimes the problem may be so severe that counselling is required. This has proven to be very beneficial. Finally, if these avenues are of no avail, contact the Ulema in your locality as to what are your islamic rights and what do they propose in favour of you. If you wish, you may go through legal channels via an advocate/attorney to demand your legal rights.\n\nWe sympathise with you and understand your dilemma. It is our humble advise to you not to lose hope in Allahs mercy. At this very moment in life you have been abused physically and emotionally and the scars of such abuse could last forever if not attended to immediately. You need to be strong and move on with life. Do not allow shaitaan to distract you as this is the ideal opportunity for him. Remember the truth will always prevail and justice will be carried out one day Insha Allah. Turn to Allah Ta’ala and supplicate for his forgiveness and ask Allah to guide you to the correct path. We make duaa that the Almighty makes the journey ahead an easy one and grants you whatever you ask for if it is good for you aameen.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
