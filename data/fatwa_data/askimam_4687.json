  "question": "Are some of us by consulting our Muftis even in trivial issues acting like Christians who consult their priests (please see details to understand).",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThere was a course being offered on the Basics of Islam at a local Masjid in our area. I mentioned this to a friend who I have been out on Jamaat with, and suggested that we take this course. He immediately said that, he will bring it up with Mufti Saab, and let me know if it?d be appropriate to take this course. I got a feeling that, we are doing the exact same thing as the Christians do with their priests, where they consult them, and regard them as an intermediary to God in every matter. What does this Mufti Saab (with all due respects to him) who never comes to this Masjid, and is 30 miles away, have to do with me taking a course on Islam?. Another ?Saathi? tried to do a Tashkeel to go out in Jamaat during this course, knowing fully well that I am in the middle of this class. All these are well educated people. I am really getting concerned about this whole movement.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe do not seem to understand the inference made between us and the\nChristians regarding the posing of questions on 'trivial issues'.\n\nThe Christians regarded their priests as Lord. The Muslims on the other hand\ndo not regard their Ulama as Lords or 'intermediaries'. The Ulama are merely\nteachers and guides who point out the correct path. A great multitude of\nMuslims are unaware of even the basic teachings of Islam. This is why the\nMusjid has offered a course of the basics of Islam.\n\nAs to your second question, you should have explained to him that you are in\nthe middle of a course and unable to go out presently. They cannot force you\nto go out as this is a voluntary participation. Sometimes, people in every\nmovement become fanatical and tend to transgress the limits and forego the\nprinciples laid down by the movement.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROV"
