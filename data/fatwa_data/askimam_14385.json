  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. on my underwear sometimes I see spots of impurity, can one pray salah while wearing it or does it need to be washed. Can water be sprinkled on it and then salah be made? 2. If you placeÂ  a small child wearing a diaper on your lap and you feel wetness (the diaper is full and leaking) but you don't see any wet spot or mark left on your pant, can you pray salah wearing that pant? If the pajama has a hole in the place where the two legs meet, and no underwear is worn, can one make salah wearing it. Keep in mind that salat is made while alone and the body is not seen when one goes in sajdah or in ruku'?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. If the amount of impurity is lesser than the inner portion of ones palm, Salaah may be performed with the impurity but is Makrooh (reprehensible). However, if the amount of impurity exceeds this amount, it will then be necessary to wash it thrice before performing Salaah.\n\n2. If the impurity cannot be seen and there is just a mere feeling of wetness, the clothes will be considered as pure. There is no need to wash it.\n\n3. According to Shariah, if one quarter of the Satr (private parts) is exposed during Salaah, the Salaah will become invalid. Therefore, if an on looker will be able to see at least one quarter of the Satr (private parts), the Salaah will not be correct even though there may not be anyone in the room.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
