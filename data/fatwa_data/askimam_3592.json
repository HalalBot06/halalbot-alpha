  "question": "I am diabetic and thinking about becoming a muslim I am prone to fainting - can I take blood tests to monitor my blood sugar during ramadan",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShari'ah (laws of Islam) are balanced and have taken into consideration\ndifferent circumstances.\n\nIf a person is ill to such an extent that he will faint due to fasting, then\nhe will be excused from fasting. Such a person may give Fidya (compensation)\nfor not fasting. However, taking blood tests during fasting is permissible\nand that does not invalidate the fast.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
