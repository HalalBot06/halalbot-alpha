A Sayyid cannot give Zakaat to another Sayyid.\n\n2. Since in the first place, you cannot give it to your sister, it will not be permissible to give it to her husband or children.\n\n3. In this case, as long as we do not have proof that the food is Haraam, it is permissible to eat from that food.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
