  "question": "Imam asking for paper marriage...The local Imam just asked me to marry him for USA papers. I feel hurt and bad",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe local Imam just asked me to marry him for USA papers. I feel hurt and bad. I do not wish to waste my life on a marriage for papers. I loved him at one point but he ran away from my hintings of a real marriage 6 months ago and I got over it and moved to Mexico. I used to live in the same town as him. We always corresponded via chat or phone NEVER in real life together. He was outraged when he learned I left the country. But he turned me down, he seemed so interested in me months ago, then when I took his hints and thought he was just so shy after a year of it, he grew mean. Fine. So I moved on and now after 3 months of being in Mexico he says he wants me to move back to California and marry him for papers. This hurt me really badly u see. Because this Imam knew I did very much love him but he killed it. I do not want to go thru the torture of moving back to USA just for a paper marriage. He hurt me very badly asking me for this, making me feel like I am not valued by him. What do you suggest, respected brother in Islam?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is sad that an Imaam has stooped to such a low level of reducing the sacred institution of marriage and the respect for women to obtain the right of citizenship. Furthermore, according to the Shari?ah, every type of premarital relationship committed is Haraam. Both of you committed this wrong. It is more sad that an Imaam, who is supposed to learned in the Shari?ah and guide people violate the laws of Shari?ah. Such a person should not be appointed as an Imaam. Sister, you too now understand the wisdom of the laws of Shari?ah prohibiting marital contact, especially after becoming a victim of the Imaam. You are special and you should value yourself. Never be used by anyone including the Imaam for such a lowly act.\n\nIf the person wants you, he must value you and formally propose and treat you with respect and honour. If he can?t do that, he doesn?t deserve your respect and honour.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
