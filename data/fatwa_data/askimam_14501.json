  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAre we allowed to praise someone either in or not in there presence?\n\nI read in a seerah that the prophet(saw) said something to the effect of praise is like a disease. However someone asked are you allowed to say thank-you and you said yes. However are you allowed to complement someone or say \"that guy is a genius\". Would that be allowed? What type of 'praise' was the prophet referring to when he associated it with a disease. If its possible can you give an example please\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is permissible to praise someone in their presence and in their absence. However, in the situation where one is praising a person in his presence, he should not excessively praise him as that may be a means of him becoming vain and proud.\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Miqdaad ibn al-Aswad that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘When you are faced with those people who praise you excessively, then throw sand onto their faces.’ This Hadith refers to those who excessively praise a person or those who praise in order to gain something.\n\nAs for praising a person or complementing a person on account of his good work, then this is permissible and allowed in the Shari’ah, for example, saying ‘Thank you’ or ‘Well done’. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] on numerous occasions had also complimented and praised various Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhu].\n\nWe are unable to locate the ‘Hadith’, ‘Praise is like a disease’. Kindly provide a reference for this Hadith.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
