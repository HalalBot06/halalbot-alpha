  "question": "Is the 4% on my credit card in this situation an interest?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am trying to purchase a house for my family and I am 20,000 $ short of buying it cash to avoid a loan through the bank. My credit card company is offering me the option to get 20,000 $ cash advance with 1 year 0 % interest, after one year interest goes up to  14 %, there is also a one-time fee they call it ‘transaction fee’ and it is  4 % one-time fee. Is this is concerned Riba or is it Halal if I intend to pay the 20,000 $ during the 0 % period?\n\nI am also concerned about the 4 %, is it Riba or not?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykumwa-rahmatullāhiwa-barakātuh.\n\nMay Allah make all our tasks easy and grant all of us Halaal income. Ameen\n\nIn principle, it is impermissible to enter a contract which has a condition of interest upon default.\n\nIf one has entered in such a contract then he has to pay back the amount before the interest starts to accumulate on the loan.\n\nAccording to our understanding, the 4% charged is a service fee. If this is the case then it is permissible to pay the 4 %.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Hussein Issa,\nMozambique\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
