  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf we have understood the question correctly, then we state that what has been given to your father?s second wife is a gift to her. This is her sole right.\n\nIf you want to ask her for a share, you may, remembering that she has a right to give you or refuse you. If this is not what you have asked, then rewrite to us stating your case clearly.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
