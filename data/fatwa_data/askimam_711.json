  "question": "Is there anything really as 'Qadhaa Salaat' in Islaam, as the Fard Sala's are ordered to be prayed at their prescribed times.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nGenerally people take it as their right to offer Khada salaat, without being feeling that they have missed Fard salaat(to offer it in its time limit).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShari'ah has emphasised performing of Fardh Salaat on time. To deliberately\nmiss performing Salaat at its prescribed time is a sin. However, if one has\nmissed performing Salaat on time, due to reasons beyond one's control, then\nonly Qadhaa Salaat should be performed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
