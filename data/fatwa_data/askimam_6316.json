  "question": "I had this dream couple of days ago in which i was reading LAILAHA ILLALLLAHO MUHAMMADUR-RASOOLULLAH out loud",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn my dream my sister & I were taken to another world or place. We were standing in front of two doors numbered 2 & 4. From the door 2 came a beautiful girl who opened it & asked me to come in. I didn't want to go but my sister told me that she had to go to the other door. So there I went in & saw there were two other girls in the room too. One was on the bed the other standing right next to me. The girl, who told me to come in, closed the door & she started to take her hair & skin off & turned into an old ugly women and the one on the bed started taking her clothes off & also looked ugly. I moved towards the other direction and started reading LAILAHA ILLALLLAHO MUHAMMADUR-RASOOLULLAH out loud. And I kept reading it & blowing it in front of me so they wouldn't be able to come near me. The first girl says to me that why do I keep saying MUHAMMADUR-RASOOLULLAH. And then I woke feeling good that I was reciting the First Kalima Tayyab (Holy). Please interpret this dream.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe girls are a reflection of the world. Outwardly, the world is beautiful\nwith much glamour in it but consequently is filled with grief and misery.\n\nThe only way to attain peace is submitting to complete Deen - to Allah and\nHis Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
