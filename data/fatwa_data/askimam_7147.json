In fardh Salaat, it is only Waajib to recite Surah Faatihah and Surah during the first two Rakaats. During the second two Rakaats, it is Sunnah to recite only Surah Faatiha.\n\nIn the third Rakaat of Witr, after the Surah Faatiha and Surah, it is Waajib to recite ?Allaahu Akbar? and then read Du?aa-e-Qunoot. In other respects, the four types of Salaat are the same.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
