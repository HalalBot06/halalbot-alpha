  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan someone use a perfume that alcohol is one of its ingredients? Also can the cloth on which this perfume is used be used to observe prayer? Thank u\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssal훮mu `alaikum Warahmatull훮hi Wabrakatuh,\n\nIf the perfume is from grapes or dates extract, it is impure. If it is from other sources besides grapes and dates, then it is pure.\n\nGenerally the perfumes available nowadays contain synthetic alcohol and therefore pure.\n\n\nIf such perfume is sprayed on a Musallah (prayer rug) the Musallah will be pure and Salah can be performed on it.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'훮la Knows Best,\n\n\nMuft카 Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
