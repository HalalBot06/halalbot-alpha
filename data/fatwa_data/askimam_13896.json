  "question": "when MAGHRIB time starts to began we should not study because that will result in memory loss",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI heard that when MAGHRIB time starts to began we should not study because that will result in memory loss (memory weakness)?Â Please explain ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAfter an extensive search we were unable to find any reference proving that studying after Maghrib causes memory loss. To the contrary, experience has proven that thousands of students in religious institutions across the globe have not suffered any memory loss inspite of intensive studying after Maghrib Salaat. Imaam Ahmad [ra] advised his students not to study after Asr Salaat as it causes weakness to the eyes. (Maqaasidul Hasan vol.398; Khanji)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
