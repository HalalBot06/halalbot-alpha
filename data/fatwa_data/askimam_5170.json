  "question": "Regarding Qurbani (Sacrifice)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespectable Mufi Sahb, I heard on this eid that Qurbani is Fardh if a person has 5000 Rupees in hand before 10 Zilhaj. But the price of 7 and half TOLA gold is more than 30000 almost. How it is? 2) Also if this 5000 Rupees is your monthly expenditure, will the Qurbani still Fardh upon you? 3) Will also the asme rule will be implemented on the obligation of Zakat if one year is passed over 5000 Rupees? Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, Qurbaani is Waajib on every free, Muslim, resident and\npossessor of Nisaab (minimum Zakaatable wealth) on the day of Eid-ul-Adha.\n(Hidaaya pg.443)\n\nTherefore, a person who has the amount of Nisaab after deducting all\nexpenses on the morning of Eid, whether a year has passed on it or not, has\nto make Qurbaani. It is not necessary that a person has ownership of such\nwealth for a full year. To determine the correct amount of Nisaab in your\ncountry and locality, we suggest you refer to the local reliable Ulama.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
