  "question": "Do I need to pay my zakaat again?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-o-aleikum, I sent my zakaat to a charity organization but it was banned and it?s assets frozen by US government at the end of Ramadhan (middle of December). I was thinking of putting a block on my check but before I could do that my check was cashed in early January although this organization was banned. Do I need to pay zakat again and if again the same amount or will I have to calculate again according to current rate of gold etc. JazakAllah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour Zakaat will have to be discharged again. The respective organization\nwill not be held responsible. (Ahsanul Fataawa vol.4 pg.299)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
