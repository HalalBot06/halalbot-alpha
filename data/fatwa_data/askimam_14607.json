  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaikum, I have a question related to fatwa #13239,you said that “when a man touches his daughter-in-law lustfully the marriage between his son n daughter-in-law terminates immediately”. My question is….its been more than one year now when I was not even pregnant my father-in-law asked me if me and my husband have intercourse properly coz I was not pregnant yet and if I had my menses regularly etc..i was very shy at his question but he forced me to awnser. Then we found out that I was pregnant and then he kissed my forehead n said ‘I love you’ and I thought that’s coz of his excitement that he would hv a grand child soon.but then he started kissing me on my cheeks and the way he looked at me was not very good. He always would kiss me when I was alone n my husband or mother-in-law was not around. At a point I started getting scared n tried to be never in front of him when no one was there but there were times when I was in kitchen cooking with my mother-in-law and if she was out of sight even for few minutes he would come n kiss me,there was a time when he kissed my cheek forcefully and once I also told him that I don’t like him kissing me n he accused me that I kissed him too when I NEVER EVER KISSED HIM!!! Then I told my husband about this and he asked me to avoid him as much as possible and remind him that he is my father-in-law n grand father of the child with whom I was pregnant.and when I did that he told me that he was sorry but cannot control himself. Then it was getting out of limit so my husband approached him n he started making excuses like he said that he was trying to kiss my forehead and I moved so he gave me kiss on my cheek. Then we planned to move out and he started telling his son in front of me that I was filling up his mind and my character is not good,I smile in front of them but in the room I m something else (I m saying all wrong things to my husband)and emotionally blackmailing my husband that if we move out Allah knows what will happen to his mother coz my mother-in-law has depression problem n cannot stay without her son .she could never imagine her son away from her.so,then we decided to stay. Then I had my baby boy n again after few days he started creating problems so then finally we decided to move out. Now we have moved out n living happily . But I m not sure if my father-in-law kissed me in some wrong intention so in this case is my marriage to my husband is terminated. I have a 10 months old son and my husband is a very pious muslim totally opposite of his father.he is a very good husband and a father to our child. If yes then how do I remarry my husband,what is the procedure?Please Mufti saab reply me as soon as possible as i m very worried. i would also like to add that my father-in-law is a wonderful man but at that moment shaytaan took over him. Jazakalla\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\nYour father in law first kissed you when you conceived. That was out of happiness of you being conceived. He repeated that a few times. You should rely on that explanation each time he kissed you. You have acted appropriately by informing your husband of your fears and the advice of your husband was also appropriate. You do not have to go deeper into your father in laws hidden feelings of the time he kissed you.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\n Mufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
