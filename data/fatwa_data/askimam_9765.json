  "question": "Do wives in Islam have the same right as their husbands and should they be treated like equals????",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a guy who believes that women are allowed the same rights as men? to an extent. Correct me if I believe wrongly. Some family backgrounds believe that wives should be under the control of their husbands; according to my intelligence it is due to thinking that women can be very vulnerable, which in my perspective is wrong, as it is more cultural. If the wife is given her rights according to the shar?iat , which she acts upon to her ability, then would it be correct for a husband to let her do her part as a wife, and according to herself. Does a husband have authority over his wife?? If yes, then does he have to act upon this authority even though the wife is obedient???\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen it comes to the rights in Islam which are between married spouses, it%0D%0Avaries. The highlighted rights which a husband has over his wife is that he%0D%0Ashould always ensure that she has a place to stay, clothing to wear and%0D%0Adaily sustenance. He also has to look after her in securing her Imaan,%0D%0Aespecially, with regards to Salat, fasting and adhering to the lifestyle as%0D%0Ashown to us by Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0AIslam is a very moderate and simple way of life. When a marital home is%0D%0Asurrounded by the laws of Islam and practicing on the very simple way of%0D%0Alife shown to us by Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), then there wouldn't%0D%0Abe any complications arising as to who has more rights and many other%0D%0Aissues.%0D%0A%0D%0AYes, the husband do have rights over the wife and she has to listen and%0D%0Aabide to his wishes, as long as it is within the confines of the Shari'ah.%0D%0ASimilarly, the wife has her own rights as well. The way we are made to%0D%0Abelieve today is that women in Islam are being oppressed. If we have to%0D%0Aabide strictly and sincerely to that golden lifestyle of Nabi (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam), then only will one understand and see the wisdom behind%0D%0Afollowing such a lifestyle.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe wife is allowed to do anything she desires so long as it is not in%0D%0Aconflict with the Shari'ah, and just as important is that the husband should%0D%0Abe pleased with it as well. One should not entertain the concept of the%0D%0Ahusband controlling the wife, because then the wife will be made a slave%0D%0Arather than a partner who should be loved. If our daily life is in%0D%0Aconformity with the Sunnat, then the aspect of controlling and being more%0D%0Acultural will never arise. Allah Ta'ala laid out the rights between the%0D%0Aspouses. These are such rights which coincides with each other very%0D%0Abeautifully and wherein nobody's rights are trampled upon or oppressed on%0D%0Acondition that it is practiced upon the way it was shown to us by the%0D%0Abeloved of Allah Ta'ala.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
