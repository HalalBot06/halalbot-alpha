  "question": "Does an adulterer who dies at a young age after contracting a disease need forgiveness from his wife?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf a man commits adultery, in order for his repentance to be accepted by Allah, must he seek forgiveness from his wife, because he betrayed her trust? What about the other way around, if it were the wife who committed the sin? Also if the man contracted a disease while committing the sin and died an early death as a result would he need to be forgiven by his wife and children because he would have left them husbandless and fatherless and so would be unable to fulfil his duties and obligations to them? May Allah (swt) reward you immensely.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAdultery is a major sin. The seriousness of the sin can be gauged by the punishment stipulated for committing such a sin.\n\nA married person is stoned to death. Adultery is a breach of the law of Allah Ta?ala as well as the mutual trust between the husband and wife. Every breach of law and trust recognized in Islam is a sin. If a person breached a trust and became willingly unfit to fulfil his responsibilities to his dependants, he will be sinful for that. he must seek their forgiveness for putting them in unwanted difficulties and hardship.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
