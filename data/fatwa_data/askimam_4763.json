  "question": "Will the hoors in Jannah be mindless robots made only for one thing (sex) or will they be like women of the earth with feelings , thoughts and moodswings?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Jannah is an exposition of\nAllah's mercy.' (Mishkaat)\n\nThe purpose of Jannat is to reward sincere servants of Allah. Among the\nrewards of Allah in Jannah, one will be the Hoors. They will be a means of\ncomfort and peace to the dwellers of Jannah. For that, they will have to be\nintelligent as well as considerate. Comfort and peace cannot be attained\nthrough a woman who is 'a mindless robbot'. Imagine being with a beautiful\nwoman but insane. No person in a sound state of mind will even approach her.\nHow can that be expected of the Hoors of Jannah, being the queens created by\nAllah to grant comfort to His sincere servants.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
