  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe have property in the name of my father and my mother. My father passed away six years back and my mother is alive ( Alhamdolillah). Can you please tell me how the ( Father name and mother name) property will be distributed among the childern. We are total 4 children (2 son and 2 daughters.)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nYou state your mother is alive. May Allah Taala keep her shadow on your’ll for a long time, Ameen.\n\nThe property is in your father’s and mother’s name. Is your mother also the owner of the property or the property is merely registered on her name also?\n\nIf she is also the owner, what is the proportion of her ownership in the property?\n\nIn any event, your father’s estate will be distributed in 48 equal shares as follows:\n\nThe wife (your mother) will receive 6 shares\n\nEach son will receive 14 shares and\n \nEach daughter will receive 7 shares.\n \nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n \nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
