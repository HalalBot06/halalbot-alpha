  "question": "As-SalaamuAlaikum Is it allowed to use interest money on the Masijd property or to pave the car park around the Masjid",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nInterest monies must be given to the poor and needy who are eligible to accept Zakaat without the intention of reward. However, interest received from government institutes, eg. post office could be used to offset government taxes. Interest received from private banks cannot be used to offset taxes. It may be used to offset interest charged from the same bank.\n\nIt is not permissible to use interest monies for the purposes mentioned by you.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
