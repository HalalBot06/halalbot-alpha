  "question": "What is the meaning of the following surat in the quran - surat 7:verse 205 \"And remember your lord by your tongue and within yourself,humbly and in awe ,without loudness\"",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFirstly, the translation of the Aayat is, 'And Remember your Lord within\nyourself'. The words, 'by your tongue.' do not feature in this Aayat.\n\nMufti Shaafi (RA) writes in the commentary of this verse that Allah Ta'ala\nhas shown us three methods of Dhikr:\na) Dhikr Qalbi: The tongue doesn't move but the heart and mind are involved\nin the remembrance of Allah\nb) With the Dhikr of the heart, the tongue also engages in Dhikr but softly\nso that only the reciter hears. Both these meanings are incorporated in 'And\nremember your Lord within yourself'.\nc) Dhikr is made audibly but in a moderate tone. This method is taken from\n'without loudness'. Note: 'without loudness' negates Dhikr made in loud\ntones, not Dhikr in an audible manner.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
