  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamualaikum\n\nIf you suspect that your employer deals in stolen goods, is it permissable to work for him?  It is only a suspicion and you have no proof.\n\nIn this case, are your earnings halaal?\n\nJazakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAllah Taala says, “Oh you who believe, stay away from excessive bad thoughts.”\n\nRasulullah (S.A.W.) said, “Guard yourselves from suspicion for verily suspicion is the worst lie.”\n\nIt is not permissible for one to have baseless suspicions on any Muslim.\n\nIt is permissible for you to continue the employment and the earnings will be halal.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
