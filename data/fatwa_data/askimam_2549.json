  "question": "Towards the end of passing out urine, a thick pale coloured fluid passes out as well. Is this mazi?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAnd do I have to repeat Ghusl if it this fluid contains semen? I do not masturbate. I have been told to squeeze the end of the penis so that the urine is completely passed out aswell. Jazakhallaahu Khair for your help. Asalaamu Alaikum\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe fluid after urine is Wadi, not Mazi. The ruling of Wadi is the same as\nurine wherein Istinjaa (washing the private parts) will suffice.\n\nYou do not have to put yourself under pain by squeezing the end of the penis\nto remove the remaining urine from it. You may try alternative methods which\nwill not affect your health.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
