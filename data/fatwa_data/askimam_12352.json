  "question": "I been divorced for 8 months as per 1 Talaaq-e-bain.Why is it not neccessary to give the other two talaaqs?Doesnt it not allow finality and closure for both parties?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTalaaq-e-Baain is an irrevocable divorce. After the Iddat, you are free to do as you wish. Your ex-husband has no control of you. As such, finality and closure is achieved.\n\nThere is no need to give the remaining two divorces to achieve finality and closure.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
