  "question": "Why is the name Nisa a name with a derogative meaning?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn regards to your response with my inquiry regarding the name Nisa (Question 12328), isn?t the meaning, women, derogatory based only upon the text in which it is used in? There are other Islamic names which are permissible but their meanings are, as well, of no particular significance and have the potential of appearing derogative as well. I.e. ? Asad = lion, Anan = clouds, Reema = gazelle, white antelope. My question is how is it that these names are considered permissible when they are, as well, of no particular meaning good or bad but Nisa would be seen as a name with a derogative connotation. As well, is the name Ariana a Muslim name?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe do not advise the naming of a child \"Nisa\" as it would be used in a manner that seems derogatory. Would any lady like to be addressed as \"Women\"?\n\nWe are unaware of the meaning of Ariana.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl.
