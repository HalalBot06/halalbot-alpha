  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu alilikum. 1.At times due to pressure of work my salat of Zohr and Asr misses. When shall I make up those salats. Can I do it after Maqrib salat on by on ?. 2. Some time Fajr salat misses. Shall I make up Khadha with sunnat or shall I pray only Faraz.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\n1. You should make every effort to perform every Salaat timeously. The\npressure of performing Salaat on time should not supercede the pressure of\nwork. However, if you did not perform Dhuhr and Asr Salaat timeously, you\nmay make Qadhaa of them after Maghrib Salaat.\n\n2. If you make Qadhaa of Fajr Salaat before midday, you should also perform\nthe Sunnats of Fajr.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
