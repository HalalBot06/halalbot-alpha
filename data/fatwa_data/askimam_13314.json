  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni want to ask about the job in bank? is it haram because of interest actitivities in bank? Plz give me answer in detail?  someone told me that the job in IT department of bank is not haram because it is not connected to the other activities  plz answer me in detail\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMufti Taqi Uthmaani Saheb (D.B.) is of the view that a person who is an employee in a commercial bank but his job has nothing to do with any interest transactions, then it will be permissible for him to work in a bank and his salary will be Halaal too e.g. as a security guard, secretary, etc. However, that person who deals with interest transactions, his salary will not be Halaal and it will not be permissible for such a person to work in the bank e.g. teller, manager, etc. Mufti Taqi saheb mentions that the salary will be Halaal for those people because the deposits are greater than the interest accrued on those deposits.\n\n \n\nThe interest money and the other money are mixed together but the interest is usually less than the other money, therefore for this reason their salary will be Halaal.
