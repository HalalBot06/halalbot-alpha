  "question": "Is denatured alcohol permissible for external application if it is made from dates or grapes?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy question is regarding denatured alcohol, which according to your previous fatwa is permissible to use for external application.  However, if the denatured alcohol is produced from dates or grapes, is it still permissible for external application, even though it is not suitable for drinking due to the addition of additives and chemicals?  Adding additives or chemicals only renders the alcohol unsuitable for consumption, but it does not make it pure since it still contains alcohol from dates and grapes.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nAlcohol derived from dates and grapes is not only impermissible for consumption, but it is also a form of gross impurity (najāsah ghalīzah).  Hence, any product containing alcohol derived from dates and grapes is impermissible for both internal and external use. \n\n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMuftī Abrar Mirza\nChicago, IL (USA)\n\nUnder the Supervision of Muftī Ebrahim Desai (South Africa)\n\n \n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER – AskImam.org questions\n\nAskImam.org answers issues pertaining to Sharī’ah.
