  "question": "1) Is it permissible for woman to wear imitation jewellery, if not why? 2) Is it permissible to go for umrah before one goes for haj?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n3) If one is married in comunity of property, is it necessary to change it? jazaakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is permissible for a female to wear imitation jewellery.\n\n2. If one has the financial means during the months of Hajj to perform Fardh Hajj, then Hajj becomes compulsory. Fardh Hajj should be performed as soon as possible. It will be permissible for one to perform Umrah before performing Hajj. However, that should not lead one to delay the Fardh Hajj.\n\n3. If one is married in community of property, then it is necessary to change that contract into an Ante-Nuptial Contract without the Accrual system. The spouses should also make a separate agreement to have their estate distributed according to the Shari'ah should any one of them pass away before the contract is changed. They should state clearly that they do not own 50% of the estate by virtue of the marriage contract. Each spouse should specify what he/she owns and that be signed by both spouses.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
