  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nSalaah is fardh on every adult, sane muslim, similarly learning the masaail related to salah viz a viz ghusul, wudu, tayamum and knowing the direction of qibla and similrarly other masail is also fardh. How would a person learn these? If he asks an aalim would it suffice? Why and How? Will we be not questioned that why did you not endeavour to find out the authenticity of the things taught to you? We, in our worldly affairs, meet different people, take their opinions and then judge ourselves to the course of action. Why is it that we do not employ the same means in the matters of our deen? On what grounds do we leave these important issues into the hands of others? We live in an age where young children have started to understand the complexities of various things.\n\nPlease reply in detail and if I have in any way sounded inappropriate kindly forgive\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nRasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) has said:\n\nطلب العلم فريضة على كل مسلم\n\n\"To acquire knowledge is the duty of every Muslim.\" (Sunan Ibn Majah)\n\nThis Hadith does not mean that every Muslim has to become a scholar of Deen. It means that it is an obligation upon every Muslim to acquire sufficient knowledge that will enable the person to carry out his religious duties. With every religious duty that is obligatory on a Muslim, the knowledge and requirements of that obligation must also be acquired. For example, every Muslim must at least attain enough knowledge on fard duties such as wudu, ghusl, salat, fasting, zakat, etc. to implement them in such a way that the duty is fulfilled properly in accordance with Shari'ah. It is Fard-Ayn (necessary upon every Muslim) to obtain this necessary knowledge. Essential knowledge may be acquired through books such as Ta'leem Al-Haq, which is simple, detailed, and easy to understand.   \n\nThe other type of knowledge in Deen is that of the experts. This type of knowledge belongs to scholars who have studied the Islamic sciences in depth such as the Quran, Aqeedah, Hadith, Fiqh, and their principles. Gaining this type of knowledge is Fard-Kifayah. This means that some people from each community must dedicate their time to gain this in-depth knowledge. If it is done then it will suffice for the community. If it is not done then the entire community will be sinful.\n\nThe aspects of Deen and Shari'ah are vast and deep. When one is unsure of a ruling or does not have knowledge about in-depth masa'ail then it is our duty to ask the expert scholars about the correct laws and rulings. In fact, it is a direct command of Allah Ta'ala to do so. Allah Ta'ala says in the Holy Quran:\n\nفاسألوا أهل الذكر إن كنتم لا تعلمون\n\n\"So ask the people of knowledge if you do not know.\" (16:43)\n\nIt is a great blessing of Allah Ta'ala that He has bestowed every generation after Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) with expert scholars so that the Ummah is not led astray. We know that there will be no prophet to come after Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). This is why Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) has said in a Hadith:\n\nإن العلماء ورثة الأنبياء وإن الأنبياء لم يورثوا دينارا ولا درهما ورثوا العلم فمن أخذه أخذ بحظ وافر\n\n\"The scholars are heirs of the Prophets. The Prophets do not leave behind an inheritance of gold and silver; they leave behind the inheritance of knowledge. Whoever acquired knowledge, acquired a lot of wealth.\" (Bukhari, Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah)\n\nThe Sahaba (Radiyallahu Anhum) used to ask and refer to Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) in all matters of Deen. Similarly, after Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) passed away the Tab'ieen (Rahmatullah Alayhim) referred to the Sahaba (Radiyallahu Anhum) and so on. The in-depth knowledge of Islam has spread to those who have been blessed by Allah Ta'ala to acquire this great knowledge from generation to generation in a continuous chain started by Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). Therefore, the abovementioned verse of the Holy Quran and Hadtih are proof that one must ask the people of knowledge who have studied the Islamic sciences in depth about matters of Deen which they do not know or have a full understanding of.\n\nThis does not mean one should take the opinion of anyone who claims to be a scholar. If someone starts taking opinions from anyone who claims to be a scholar, they may be led astray. One should find an 'Alim of the Ahl-al-Sunnah Wal-Jama'ah, preferably one who follows the same madhab. He should have the qualities of a true scholar of Deen such as humility and having true taqwa (fear of Allah Ta'ala). He should be one who adheres to the sunnah of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). One must make sure he studied and attained his knowledge with the guidance of other 'Ulema with these same qualities. The true meaning of an 'Alim is defined in the Holy Quran. Allah Ta'ala says:\n\nإنما يخشى الله من عباده العلماء\n\n\"Only those of His slaves fear Allah who are knowledgeable.\" (35:28)\n\nHasan Al-Basri (Rahmatullah Alayhi) says about this verse:\n\n\"An 'Alim is a person who fears Allah in private and in public, and does what Allah wants him to do, and hates what is detestable in the sight of Allah.\"\n\nMujahid (Rahmatullah Alayhi), the famous Mufassir of Quran also said about this verse:\n\n\"Only he who fears Allah is the real 'Alim.\"\n\n(Ma'ariful Quran)\n\nIf a person claims to be an 'Alim but he openly violates the laws of Shari'ah, for example, he shaves or trims his beard less than one fist, he openly intermingles with the opposite gender, or there ar no signs of taqwa and piety in his life, then one should abstain from asking such a person.\n\nIn conclusion, it is a direct command of Allah Ta'ala from the Quran for us to ask those that are learned in the Deen when we do not know or have a full understanding of something in Deen. It is compulsory upon us to obey the commands of Allah Ta'ala. As long as the abovementioned guidelines are followed, InshaAllah one will be guided properly. One must have full faith when consulting with the learned scholars whom Allah Ta'ala chose to guide this ummah. On the contrary, if one does not obey the command of Allah Ta'ala by not asking those that are learned in the Islamic sciences, then it is likely that one will be led astray. May Allah Ta'ala protect our ummah.       \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Asif Umar,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
