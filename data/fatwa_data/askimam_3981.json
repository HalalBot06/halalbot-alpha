  "question": "Please answer my question on 'acts of kufr'",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn ignorance and because of lack of knowledge on such issues I (unknowingly of the consequenses of my action), did something which I regret/repent very much and am worried that my nikkah has terminated due to it. The other day I received one of those 'chain e-mails' saying that if you don't forward it to ten other people, something bad will happen to you (there was no kufr in the mail. It was just about a girl who was ill and cured with dua). But I fear that as I did sent it on to ten people 'just in case' I beleived that something might happen if I didn't. Therefore I beleived in superstition as I didn't have the proper Islamic knowledge about how to act. I now know I was wrong to beleive such things due to doing reading and research on the topic. Did I commit an act of kufr in beleiving such superstitions. I am very worried that my nikkah has terminated. Please advize what I should do.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis is like the letter of 'Shaykh Ahmadu of Madina' which is still in\ncirculation and unfortunately unwary Muslims continue to believe in it.\nHundres of copies are regularly made and distributed to Muslims and until\nrecently people are receiving it in the post. Furthermore, now the internet\nand electronic mail is used to intensify the campaign.\n\nWe have previously warned Muslims about such publications. In our opinion,\nthe above unauthored letter and information is probably of the same nature\nand Muslims are advised to disregard it totally.\n\nForwarding the letter does not affect your Nikah. Your Nikah is intact.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
