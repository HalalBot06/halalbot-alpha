  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have noticed a few brothers in our community having plaited hair. Some of them have their hair similar to the rastafarian's 'locks'.\n \nCan you please give me a detailed response as to whether we are allowed to keep that hair style?\nIs the wudhu and ghusl accepted if a muslim has that sort of hairstyle? What if they give adhan and iqamah?\nAre there any differences of opinions regarding this issue?\nWill appreciate a detailed response including hadiths etc.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nIt is permissible to have the hair plaited or braided. The wuzu and ghusl of one whose hair is fashioned in this manner will be correct; however, at the time of ghusl, a man has to open up his plaited/braided hair and ensure that not a single hair is left dry. If even a hair is left dry, the ghusl will be invalid. A female will not have to open her plaited hair. (Beshti Zewar p63 vol1)\n\n \n\nTo give Azaan and Iqamah in the state of Janabat (ie. one in need of ghusl), is Makrooh. If Azaan and Iqamah had been given in this state, the Azaan will have to be repeated, not the Iqamah. (Fatawa Hindiya vol1 p54 Maktaba Rashidiya)\n\n \n\nThere is a difference between braids and ‘locks’. Braids are plaited hair, whereas locks are heavily matted coils of hair which form by themselves eventually fusing together to form a single dread. This happens when hair is left to grow naturally without combing or using conditioning for a long period of time; thus, making it very difficult to maintain. This type of hair style is against the basic principle of Islamic etiquette of cleanliness and should not be kept.\n\n \n\nعن وائل بن حجر قال أتيت النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم ولى شعر طويل فلما رآنى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال ذباب ذباب  قال فرجعت فجززته ثم أتيته من الغد فقال إنى لم أعنك وهذا أحسن\n\n \n\nHazrat Waa il bin Hajr رضى الله عنه said:\n\n“I came to Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم having long hair. When Rasululah صلى الله عليه و سلمsaw me, he said “An eternal awfulness”. He said “Then I returned and cut it and came to him the next day; he then said “I did not mean you, but this is better.”\n\n(Abu Dawud p 220 vol2)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
