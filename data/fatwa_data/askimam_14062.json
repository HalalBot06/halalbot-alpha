  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it true that it is haram to place a dead person in a coffin to bury him/her? What about tombstones, are they haram as well?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nA dead person should be buried without a coffin. However, if it is a legal requirement to bury a person in a coffin, then that will be excused.\n\nIt is permissible to place a simple marker on one side of the grave to indicate the identity of the dead. It is not permissible to erect the customary tombstone with the name of the person and his praises.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
