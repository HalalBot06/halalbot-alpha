  "question": "Regarding Adoption",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThis is an extention to question No 2757 which I have asked for adoption of a child. What exactly the Islam says about Adoption. Can I give my name to the child which I am going to adopt.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWhat is the Islamic view with regard to adoption?\n\nIf by adoption is meant that you take a poor child and look after his\nboarding, lodging and clothing, Islam has always stressed the importance of\nhelping the poor and needy people. One can always give charity and fatherly\nlove to the child.\n\nIt is reported in a Hadith that the one who assumes responsibility for the\nwell-being of an orphan will be granted the nearness of Nabi (Sallallahu\nAlayhi Wasallam) in Jannat (Mishkaat). This is an extremely neglected Sunnat\nof our beloved Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and we should definitely\naspire in this direction; however, we must uphold the framework of the\nShariah.\n\nOne cannot legally adopt; you cannot give your name to the child. Legal\nadoption like this is prohibited in Islam.\n\nIf a person legally adopts a child there can be several complications.\nFirstly, the child will lose his identity. Secondly, suppose after adopting\na child one has children of his own. It is natural that in such a situation\nyou will show bias in favour of your own blood child. Thirdly, if the child\nborn to you is of the opposite sex to the adopted child, they cannot freely\nstay in the same home because they aren’t blood related to each other. When\nthe adopted child, a girl, grows up, she has to make Purdah (Hijaab) with\nthe adopted father as he is not her real father. If the boy becomes a man\nand marries, there will be Hijaab between the so called father and\ndaughter-in-law.\n\nIf you adopt a child you will be depriving him/her of many rights. If a\nperson dies, the property that he leaves behind has to be divided according\nto what is mentioned in the Qur’an.\n\nIf the person has children and if he legally adopted a child, he will be\ndepriving his own child of his legitimate inheritance. If a person has no\nchildren when he dies, then his wife will get 1/4 the estate. If there are\nchildren she gets 1/8. Again the adopted child will reduce the share of the\nmother should this child be considered legally legitimate.\n\nTo avoid all these complications, legal adoption is prohibited in Islam.\nHowever this should in no way dissuade us from earning tremendous reward by\ntaking care of orphan children.\n\nand Allah Ta’ala Knows Best"
