  "answer": "QUESTION\nI plan to perform all my qaza salats. Please answer me the following questions. 1. Can I read qaza salat with ada salat azan or I need read seperate azan for qaza salat? 2. Is it necessary to read iqamat in the mosque for ada and qaza salats when I perform myself (not with jamath) 3. How about if one forgot have niyyat for qaza fasting (those missed in the month of ramadan)? will it be valid if have niyyat after sahr time end? 4. Can I read qaza salats in between shar and fajr? 5. Can I read qaza salats in between sunnah and fard of ada salats? 6. Can I read qaza salats instead of sunnah those not compulsory (example instead sunnah of asar can I read qaza salats)?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is Sunnat to call out the Adhaan for Qadhaa Salaat if the missed\nSalaat is performed with Jamaat. If a person is performing the missed Salaat\nindividually, he should not call out the Adhaan. (Shaami vol.1 pg.390; HM\nSaeed)\n2. It is Makrooh (disliked) to omit the Iqaamat when performing Salaat\nindividually. (Ibid pg.394)\n3. It is necessary to make intention of a missed fast of Ramadhaan before\nSehri. (Tahtawi pg.352; Qadeemi)\n4. In principle, the time of Fajr Salaat commences at the termination of\nSehri. It is Makrooh to perform any Salaat besides the Sunnats and Fardh of\nFajr after the commencement of the time of Fajr (Tahtawi pg.101; Qadeemi)\n5. Yes. It is permissible with the exception of Fajr Salaat.\n6. It is encouraged that one person his/her missed Salaat instead of\nSunnat-e-Ghayr Muakkadah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
