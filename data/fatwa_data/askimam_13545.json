  "answer": "QUESTION\nAOA DEAR IMAM I HAVE A QUESTION WANT TO EXPLAN, HERE I HAVE A FRIEND WHO BELONGS TO SHIIT HE WAS SAYING THAT WHEN MUHAMMAD PBUH LEFT THIS WORLD (WISSAL) THEN ALL THE SAHABA EXCEPT HAZRAT ALI (RA) GATHARED IN A HOUSE (SHOORA) AND QUARL ON KHILAFT. HE SAID THAT THERE WAS ONE BONE AND ALL OF THEM WANT SAID BONE (I WANT TO EXPLAN HE SAID LIKE A GREEDY DOG) HE FURTHER SAID THAT NOBODY CAME AT THE TIME OF FURNEL OF MUHAMAMD PBUH ONLY HAZRAT ALI, SALAMAN FARSI ETC WERE THERE WHO PAY JANAZA, I WANT TO ASK WAHT IS THE FACT KINDLY EXPLAIN IN THE LIGHT OF QURAN AND HADEES\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe lies and false propaganda presented to you is nothing new. The Kaafir Shiahs have always attempted to created an evil image of the noble Sahaabah (companions) of our beloved Rasool (Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam ). They invent many lies to do this.\n\nWhere is it recorded that there was only one bone, and the Sahaabah (Radhiyallahu unhum) were fighting like dogs? This is something made up by the wretched and evil enemies of Islam, the Shiahs.\n\nAll the senior Sahaabah (Radhiyallahu unhum) took part in the Janaazah of Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam).\n\nAllah Ta’ala has praised the Sahaabah (Radhiyallahu unhum) in the Qur’aan, on numerous occasions. If they (the Sahaaabah) were kaafir as the Shiahs claim, then it would imply (Allah forbid) that Allah Ta’ala had made an error. Thus the folly of the shiahs is manifest.\n\nBe wary of these Shiahs who snatch a person’s imaan. Their Kufr is worst than that of the Jews and Christians.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala knows best.\n\nWas Salaam\n\nE. Vawda\nfor Daarul Iftaa"
