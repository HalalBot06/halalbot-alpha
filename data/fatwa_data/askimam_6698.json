  "answer": "QUESTION\nI heard there are three diff sunnats of hair..what are they? secondly is getting head shaven a sunnah of Janaab-e- Nabi Kareem (sallahu alahi wasallam) or Hazrat Ali (r.a)?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe hair of Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) reached different\nlenghts at different times as is evident from the various ahadith. Some\nahadith state that the hair of Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam)\nreached till the middle of his ears. Another narration state that it was\ntill the ear lobes. Some state that it reached his shoulders.\n\nHence it can only be concluded that at different times the lenght was\ndifferent.\n\nIt is proven from many ahadith that Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam)\ndid shave his hair on various occasions. However this was not done always.\n\nIn Sunan Abi Dawud (Hadith 248) it is stated that Hadrat Ali (radiyallahu\nanhu) after narrating the hadith of the warning for one who leaves out\nwashing one hair when taking the ghusl of janaba said: \"Is is because of\nthis that I have made an enemy out of my head\" i.e. he used to always shave\nhis head.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
