  "question": "Greetings to you Imam. I wish to know whether it is permitted to draw faces?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf there is an outline of a drawing (faces/animals faces)and you go over the outline, is it permitted?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe have not come across any specific ruling in this matter. Thus, the safest\nwould be to regard such drawings as Haraam, as is the position with the\ndrawings of all animate objects.\n\nHowever, if the head is totally removed, such drawings will be permissible.\n(Mirqaat vol. 8 pg.334)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
