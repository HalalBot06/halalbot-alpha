  "answer": "QUESTION\ncan you tell what we are supposed to have been taught about the Sharia. I have so far been on jamaat for 40 days and 3 days a few times. Not once have I heard a bayan, a sitting talk, or a muzakarat about the Sharia Law. No one has (here in America and on tablighi jamaah) to me ever expressed the need for a Sharia government in the USA to make the laws Allah has given us supreme above the man made laws that are currently governing the Muslims here. Maybe it is the current events that have made the foreign brothers scared of deportation or something. I am American is it my duty to make efforts towards the establishment of Sharia and is this what the shura means when they say to establish the tabligh work in my locality, do they mean to make efforts on the establishment of Sharia Law?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe emphasis in Da?awah and Tabligh is to revive Deen in a person?s life. To remind a person of his purpose of life, to be obedient to Allah and conscientise him of death, life after death and accountability in the court of Allah. This is what is meant by basic Shari?ah.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf the above mentioned aspects are in a Muslim?s life, that will create an urge in him to learn Deen, to be a Haafiz or an Aalim. His faith will be strong enough for him to sacrifice a few years to go to an educational institute to study Deen in depth and work towards implementing that in one?s community and environment. It is not expected of a person spending few months in Tabligh to be discussing the laws of Shari?ah. That is the work of scholars. Alhamdulillah, in many parts of the world, there are many Ulama who are the products of the effort of Da?awat and Tabligh. They or their parents have been conscientised on Deen and that led them to go abroad and spent 8%2F10 years away from home. Now they are leading Ulama in their communities doing invaluable work of establishing and spreading the Deen of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
