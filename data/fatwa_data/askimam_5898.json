  "question": "Can a husband take a second wife without the first wifes knowledge if he fears loosing his child from his 1st marriage?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu Alalikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh A brother is married and has a young daughter. His marriage is quite an unhappy one and his wife has denied him his marital rights for over six months. He has become increasingly frustrated by this and her lack of support for his career. The other problem in the marriage is that his wife does not perform any salah at all and he feels this is a bad influence on his daughter. He knows of a pious muslim woman and would like to marry her. She is agreeable to being his second wife. His problem is that he is very afraid of loosing his daughter and fears that if his wife should learn of the second marriage she will deny him the right to see his her.So he would like to take the second wife without the first wifes knowledge. This to prevent him from haram and gravely sinful affairs. He also feels that the second proposed wife will encourage him to be more steadfast in his salah and generally increase his eeman and knowledge. He has the means to be able to support both households. Both the brother and proposed second wife appear to have had positive indications from Istikhara regarding the proposed marriage. The brother would like to be certain that the second marriage would be haram. Wa 'Alaikums Salam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNikah is something to be made public. The reason is quite obvious, it\nprevents people pointing fingers at anyone. Hence, our suggestion is that he\ninforms his first wife as well. Sooner or later, she is bound to learn of\nthis marriage even if he does not inform her initially.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
