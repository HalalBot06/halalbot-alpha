  "answer": "QUESTION\nthere was this Hindu girl sittng near me tellng ppl around us in the past a Hindu army defeatd a Muslim army led by Muhamed As she was sayng her story I saw the story as if a movie playing b4 my eyes. I saw 2 armies metng on a plain that was mostly dirt with a few plants and a creek behind the ppl.Hindu army was coming from left and the Muslims from right.Leading the Hindu army was a man who looked like the Sikh ppl guru wearing a metal helmet pointed at the top I dont remember if the Prophet was wearing a helmet Im sure he must been I was more attracted to his large bushy beard and his kind smiling face.Hindu army was advancing meanly but the Prft kept advancing with a calm look on his face as if he already knew what the outcome of this battle would be As soon as both the armies met the Prophet stopped right there and surrendered to the .I remember him tilting his head down a bit and holding up his index finger, in the same way an amused person does but the Prophet was doing this gesture to tell the arrogantly advancing army that they did not wish to fight and that they wanted to surrender and give victory to the Hindus. After this vision was over, which meant that the Hindu girl was done telling her story to everyone, I became quite angry and began arguing with her.Since I am Alimah I began arguing that I had read the entire history of Muhammed and never in his liftime he ever battld Hindus and that Muslims had always left their wars with victory.I woke up at this point\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour dream is indicating towards the Muslims being influenced by the Hindu culture and adopting their way of life, especially in India and Pakistan. It is being instilled in their minds that they will remain unsuccessful even if a pious Muslim leader will lead them. They are being psychologically intimidated by propaganda through the media. However, your rejecting of her propaganda is a sign of the strength of your Imaan and your gaining the correct knowledge. %0D%0A%0D%0AThere is an intense need to incline the Muslims towards the correct knowledge. They should be instructed not to be influenced and care as to what is being propagated about the Muslims being weak and uncivilised, etc through the media.%0D%0A%0D%0AA lot of attempts are being made in the present age to psychologically weaken the Muslims and to prove their traditions and rituals to be inferior and ineffective.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Ashraf%0D%0ADARUL IFTA ?
