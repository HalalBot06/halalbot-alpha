  "question": "1. When does the Sahoor time end? According to the local Mosque here, it’s 5 minutes b4 Fajr. 2. provide meanings of the Du’aas that are generally recited at end of Sahoor",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have observed according to some other Masaajid, it?s as much as 20 minutes b4 Fajr. (The 5 minute difference seems to be the most common.) Please advise. 2. Also please provide the meaning of the Du?aas that are generally recited at the end of Sahoor, and commencement of Iftaar. If you have available, the related Hadith, that will be great. May Allah S.W.T. ignore all our shortcomings and lack of understanding, and accept our fasting. Aameen.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The ending of Sahoor time is not based on Adhaan of Fajr, but instead it is based on Subh-e-Saadi time.\n2. The Adhaan of Fajr is brought forward because of inconvenience for people in the month of Ramadhaan.\n3. End of Sahoor: O Allah! I intend fasting tomorrow for your sake and forgive my past and future sins.\nIftaar: O Allah! I have fasted for you and upon your sustenance terminates by fast. (Abu Dawud)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
