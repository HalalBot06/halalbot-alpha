  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am required to read Julius Caesar which has a lot of kuffr phrases and a book called Greek and Mythology, which is fully a kaffir book. Is it allowed under this circumstance for me to read this book for school work? And I wanted to help my fellow Muslims in their school work, so when they don?t do it, I let them copy, is it right for me this way and I feel lowly when I say no to them, what do I do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOne may study such material, providing that one has no intention of\nconcurring with the content in any way. However, one should not do so if\nthere is a fear of detriment to one's Imaan. If there is a fear of Kufr, to\nstudy such material is not permissible.\n\nCopying or assisting others to do so is dishonesty and does not behove a Mu'\nmin.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
