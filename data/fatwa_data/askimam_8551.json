  "question": "How to behave Mother after she has been misguided by some magician or Aalim?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like to know the reponsibilities and duties of a son who has already performed his responsibilities according to shaia. After the death of my father I supported my mother, brothers,& sisters, everything right from study (college fees books etc. etc) till their weddings etc I did my responsibilities very well and prey Allah to accept my AKHLAS. I did not and do not claim the return of my services rendered to them as I considered as part of my duties entrusted by ALLAH. But the behaviour of my family mainly sisters and mother is not religiously appropriate with me and my family (wife, sons & daughters).They did very improper behaviour with me and my family which they are not supposed to do with even to any stranger, instead they did to me (their own son and brother). Through many acts or their behaviour to me and my Ahlo-Ayal and through some dreams it is confirmed that my family (Ahlo-Ayal) has been subjected to taveezat/amlyat (sifli amal etc.) One of these is they stopped (Bandish) the marriage of my daughters through taveezat/jadu-tona/sifli amal etc 1. I need your guidance how to behave my mother now, particularly after performing my duties relegiously whole life to my mother, my brothers & Sisters. 2. Secondly I need from you some kind of special wazeefa etc. in order to get married my daughters & sons soon. I request you to get me out of this problem. Jazauq Allah khairan fid-dunya wa Al-Akhirah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The best reward that you will acquire for the services that you rendered to your mother, brothers and sisters will be the reward of the Hereafter insha-Allah. You should exercise patience and not worry about them ill treating you in return of your favours on them. In actual fact Shaitaan is trying to cause misunderstandings and a rift between you and your family. You should go against the Shaitaan and join family ties with your close ones for the sake of Allah without hoping for anything in return from them.%0D%0A%0D%0AA Sahabi complained to Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) that: ?I have relatives who do not wish to associate with me when I associate with them, I do good to them while they ill-treat me, they continuously cause difficulties to me and I endure their difficulties.? Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) replied that: ?If this is really the case then in reality you are throwing dust on their faces (meaning you are answering their ill-treatment with wisdom) and an assistant will be appointed for you by Allah Ta?ala against them as long as you are in this situation.? It is also stated in another Hadith that the actual recipient of the reward of joining family ties is the one who associates with his relatives while they do not wish to do so and not the one who gives his relatives in return of their favours on him. Another Hadith states that: ?Be good to your parents even though they may oppress you.? (Mishkaat) Therefore you should not severe family ties with your brothers, sisters and especially your mother. In fact you should associate with them, write to them if they stay at a distance, assist them at the time of difficulties, respond to their invitations and partake in their happy moments. This will be sufficient to fulfil your duty of joining family ties. To visit them daily and fulfilling all their desires will not be necessary to accomplish the duty of joining family ties. if your mother is in need of services which no one is attending to, then it will be incumbent on you to attend to it. Similarly if she is financially in need then it will be incumbent on you to finance her according to your capability.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. A lot of difficulties can be averted through joining family ties and giving charity. You should free your mind of such thoughts that your family has been subjected to Jadoo (Black magic, etc). The more thought you give to it the more it will trouble you. You and your family should read the Manzil and Munaajaat-e-Maqbool punctually. Together with that your children should recite Verse 74 of Surah Furqaan and Verse 24 of Surah Qasas for their marriage.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf you are living in Saudi Arabia you can refer to Moulana Abdul Hafeez Makki (D.B.) in Makkah who will be able to assist you with your problems.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Ashraf%0D%0ADarul Ifta ?
