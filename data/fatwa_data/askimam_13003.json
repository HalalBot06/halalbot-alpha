  "question": "I wanted to know if we are punished 70 times for each sin we commit in ramadan.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI know that we are rewarded 70 times for our good deeds in Ramadan. I wanted to know if the same goes for sins. I have heard that this is not true but am unsure. Please let me know about this.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt has been mentioned in a narration that Whoever does a good deed in this blessed month, it will be equivalent to one who has fulfilled a fardh duty during any other month (and will be rewarded as such). And whoever fulfills a fardh duty during Ramadhan, it will be equivalent to one who has fulfilled 70 fardh duties (and will be rewarded as such). [Mishkat, Baihaqi]%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AEvery deed the son of Adam does will be multiplied ten fold to seven hundred fold and the reward given accordingly. But Allah has said that fasting is an exception because it is observed for His sake and He will reward for it. A man gives up his passion and food for is sake. [Bukhari and Muslim, from Abu Hurayrah radhiallahu anhu]%0D%0A%0D%0AThe severity of sin is increased when it is a blessed time (e.g. ramadhan) and a blessed place (e.g. Masjid). To make a sin in the Masjid and to make a sin outside the Masjid is not the same. Similarly, those people who go against Allah s orders in Ramadhan, and have no regard for this blessed month which is amongst the rituals of Islam, for them the matter becomes even more dangerous! Allah knows best to how much more severe the sin becomes! May Allah protect us (Ameen).%0D%0A[Rehmatullah al-wasi a sharah hujjatullah al-blighah, by Hazrat Shah Waliyullah p.g 117]%0D%0A%0D%0ARemember! Cursed is the one upon whom Ramadhan comes and goes, yet is still not forgiven. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
