  "question": "in case of a secret nikkah can the imam be the brides wallee ?will the nikkah be void?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\ni had two witnesses but as the imam told us the way my wife wrote a fax showing her age n details n free will n wish so is the nikkah void?she was in pakistan at the time of nikkah plz help\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the woman wrote out a letter or sent a fax clearly stating that she has\nmade the Imaam her Waliy (representative) and that her Nikah should be made\nto yourself, then in order for the Nikah to be valid, you will have to\nverbally accept her as your wife in front of two witnesses and in the\npresence of the Imaam, whom the women had given consent to.
