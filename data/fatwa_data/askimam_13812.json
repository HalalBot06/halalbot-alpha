  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nFirst, I would like to thank you for answering all our questions. Here in Australia, we rely heavily on your fatwas and answers to questions, as we do not have similar local website. You and all those helping you are doing a great job indeed for the whole Ummah. May Allah (SWT) bless you all, accept your efforts and sacrifice and grant you the best jannah incha ALLAH. The new website www.askimam.org with login facilities is much better, and more user friendly. Congratulations for this excellent achievement.\n\n \n\nI kindly request that you answer the following questions for me at your earliest convenience:\n\n \n\nI have approached the bank and explained that I want to buy a house with a loan from them that complies with Islamic Law and Principles. I have asked that they buy the house for me, and agree to re-sell to me with an agreed profit, and the total amount I will pay back in fixed instalments for 25 years. During the repayment period, the bank shall retain ownership of the house. Until and unless I repay the full amount, then there will be a transfer of title and the house will be mine. Will this be a halal finance?\n\n \n\n \n\nI have dreamt a couple of times before fajr salaat that I am flying myself and overlooking the earth and nice landscape (like a bird’s view). Is this a good dream or a bad dream? Please interpret.\n\n \n\n \n\nIs spending time in khuruj (3 days, 40 days, 4 months etc.) considered as ‘striving in the path of Allah’ as mentioned in Surah Taubah? If yes, please explain in details how this conclusion has been drawn from Quran and Hadith.\n\n \n\n \n\nI have serious doubts that I can be a hypocrite. I have a strange feeling that all the a’mals I’m doing (salaat, quran recitation, tasbih, visiting muslim brothers and giving them daawa, going khuruj etc.) are solely to show off to the elders and not to please Allah. I am very worried about this. How do I know that I am a hypocrite?\n\n \n\n \n\nI have been told by a muslim brother that Surah Dukhan cannot be memorised if a person is a hypocrite (munafeek). Is this true? Does that mean if I manage to memorise Surah Dukhan, then it will be an indication that I am true muslim?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nJazaakumullah for your du’aas and kind words. Please convey the message of the change of our site to the people of Australia through whatever means you have.\n\nIf you identify a house and the banks buys the house on its behalf, the bank will be the sole owner of the house. The bank then sells you the house at a profit. You will then become the owner of the house. You may offer the bank a collateral as an assurance for the payment to the bank. The collateral could also be the house which will be released to you upon payment of the debt to the bank.\n\nYou may forward your other queries at another instance as we have to attend to a volume of other queries.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
