  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is the longest the hair on the head should be for a male? Is it permissible for a woman to cut her hair?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1)It is established from the Sunnah that the longest Nabi(Salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam) kept his hair was till his shoulders. This permissible and is in fact Sunnah. However to allow the hair to grow so long that it resembles a female's hair is not permissible. (Aap Kaa Masaail vol.7 pg.136 Maktaba Ludhyanwi) 2)It is not permissible for women to cut their hair. (Shaami vol.6 pg.407 H.M.Saeed)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
