  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have discussed some opportunities about a particular business with a friend who is good in dealing. But except for Jum'uahs he rarely offers salat. I feel that he is the correct person who has some knowledge about the scope and is hard working. But then I feel, when he is not sincere to Allah, how can he be sincere with me. Therefore, I should expect some problems when I am dealing with him in terms of money. Kindly give your mashwara, whether I should start a business with him or not.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the brother has good skills in doing business and is trustworthy, you may enter into a partnership with him.\n\nIf the partnership agreement is done according to the Shari?ah and it is in writing and there is no ambiguity in the agreement, then there should not be any problems.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
