  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. What are the rules regarding performing Qaza Salaah ?\n  - Which parts of the day can one perform them ?\n  - Could nafl and sunnat prayers be replaced with Qaza ones , eg. to make an intention saying \" I am performing four rakaats qaza of Zohar \" and not read the four sunnat, but only the qaza\n  - The method of going about estimating the amount of Qaza, would it be ok for me to count from the day I became Baaligh, even though I did perform salaah in this time but not all. \n\n2. The best form of taubah. and the best isthigfaar to recite\n\n3. Daily zikr to recite as well as a suggested daily routine to follow\n\n\n  - To gain Closeness to Allah\n  - To aid me in abstaining from sin\n  - For a good spouse, to become a subservient wife and pious mother\n  - Concentration and undivided attention in salaah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1.      A person can perform Qadha Salah at any part of the day except for the three Makrūh (disliked) times of Salah, namely sunrise, Zawāl (when the sun is at its zenith) and sunset. One should perform their Sunnah Salahs with the intention of Sunnah and not substitute it with the intention of Qadha. However, the same will not apply for Nafl Salahs, one should utilize times of Nafl to perform the Qadha Salahs, it is hoped that a person will still receive the reward of the Nafl despite the fact that he / she utilizes the times for Qadha Salah. (Fatāwā Mahmūdiyah, v. 7 pg. 385, Furqaniyah)\n\n \n\nوفي الحجة الاشتغال بالفوائت أولى وأهم من النوافل إلا السنن المعروفة وصلاة الضحى وصلاة التسبيح والصلوات التي رويت في الأخبار فيها سور معدودة وأذكار معهودة فتلك بنية النفل وغيرها بنية القضاء ، كذا في المضمرات (الفتاوى الهندية و حاشية الطحطاوي على مرارقي الفلاح ص 447 العلمية )\n\n You should make an earnest effort to estimate the amount of Salahs to make up. To do this, you can commence calculating from the time you became Baligh; however, you should also estimate how many Salahs you might have performed already in order to subtract that number from the total number of Salahs since the age of your Bulūgh. You should stop performing the Qadha Salahs when you are relatively certain that you have completed them all. \n\n \n\n2.      The best form of Istighfar is a Du‘ā referred to as Sayyid al-Istighfar:\n\nاللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ رَبِّي , لا إِلَهَ إِلا أَنْتَ، خَلَقْتَنِي وَأَنَا عَبْدُكَ، وَعَلَى عَهْدِكَ وَوَعْدِكَ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُ، أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا صَنَعْتُ، وَأَبُوءُ بنعْمَتِكَ عَلَيَّ، وَأَبُوءُ بِذَنْبِي، فَاغْفِرْ لِي، إِنَّهُ لا يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ إِلا أَنْتَ\n\n“Oh Allah, You are my Rabb, there is no deity other than You. You have created me and I am your slave and I am trying to fulfill your pledge and covenant to the best of my ability. I seek refuge in You from the evil that I have committed. I acknowledge Your blessing upon me and I confess my sin; thus, forgive me. Verily no one forgives sins other than You.”\n\n \n\n3.      We recommend that you stay punctual with your daily Salah; ensuring that it is performed with as much concentration and devotion as possible. If time permits try to take some time out after Fajr and / or after Asr and perform Zikr in utmost serenity and seclusion with concentration and devotion. You should recite one Tasbih of the third Kalima i.e. سبحان الله و الحمد لله و لا اله الا الله و الله اكبر , one Tasbih of Salam upon Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم (Durūd) and one Tasbih of Istighfar at these times. Together with that, you should attempt to free some time out of your day to recite a portion of the Holy Quran that is manageable for you. To strengthen your spirituality and assist you in your sacred journey towards Allah Ta‘ālā you should identify a pious and learned Shaykh whose guidance you can seek. You should request him to guide you in these spiritual matters on a continual basis. He can instruct you with further and more detailed instructions and assistance. If you experience difficulty in identifying such a person, you can refer back to the Darul Ifta for further assistance.  \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
