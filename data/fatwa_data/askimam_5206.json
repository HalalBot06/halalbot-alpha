  "question": "Marriage without the permission of parents.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWill marriage without the awareness of parents be valid and will the person be sinful in the court of Allah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, the validity of the Nikah depends on Iejaab (offer) and Qubool\n(acceptance) and the presence of two Muslim male witnesses, who are free,\nBaaligh and sane or two females and one man.\n\nHowever, you should bear in mind the duties and responsibilities that we\nhave towards our parents as well. In a Hadith, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) mentioned, 'The pleasure of your Lord lies in the pleasure of your\nparent and the anger of your Lord is in the anger of your parents.'\nTherefore, such a major decision in life, e.g. marriage, etc. should be done\nwith proper consultation and referring with all the different parties\ninvolved especially one's parents. This will in turn create more Barkaat\n(blessings) in the marriage.\n\nThe decision of your parents will be motivated by their love and concern for\nyou.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
