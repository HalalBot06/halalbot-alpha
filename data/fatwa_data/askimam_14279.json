  "question": "my children go to an Islamic school and they often bring papers home with the name of Allah ta'ala in English. Do we have to burn these papers?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nmy question is regarding contraception. I have 5 children and I feel that I do not want anymore children as mentally and physically I am very tired. I understand that a woman can use contraception provided it's reversible and not because of poverty. I am considering the sterilisation operation which the doctors say it is reversible however they also say that another operation has to be performed and then only 50% of women are able to get pregnant. So my question is does it have to be 100% reversible or is 50% or even 40% or whatever enough. jazakallaho khair for your time.\n\nAnother short question, my children go to an Islamic school and they often bring papers home with the name of Allah ta'ala in English. Do we have to burn these papers?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to your explanation, it will not be permissible to sterilise if the sterilisation process is reversable and has a potential to eliminate the ability of pregnancy.\n\nPapers having the name of Allah should be respected. If the contents of the paper are necessary, then such papers should be filed away. If the contents are not necessary and one needs to dispose off such papers, then such papers should be buried or burned.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
