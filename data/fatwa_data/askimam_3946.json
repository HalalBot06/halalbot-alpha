Allah Ta'ala knows the wisdom of%0D%0Ahis doings, perhaps the children that were to be born could have been a%0D%0Acalamity on you. This was from Allah Ta'ala and we should clearly understand%0D%0Athat we cannot escape the decision of Allah with regard to any matter in our%0D%0Alives.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhatever Allah Ta'ala decides will happen. We have to have faith in Tafweez%0D%0A(resigning oneself to the decision of Allah) and Taqdeer (predestination).%0D%0AThis is the solution to all our anxieties, depression and worries. As the%0D%0Aservants and slaves of Allah, we should understand that our Master will%0D%0Agrant to us only that which is good for us. Our duty and endeavour is that%0D%0Awe supplicate and ask Allah, then make the correct Tadbeer (effort) and%0D%0Athereafter leave the final decision to Allah Ta'ala. this brings peace,%0D%0Acontentment and happiness into one's heart. Our advise is that you should%0D%0Acondition your heart and generate at least to some extent the favour of%0D%0AImaan. Conduct Ta'leem, i.e. read some portion from the famous book of%0D%0A'Fadhaail-e-A'amaal' by Shaykh Zakariyyah (RA) everyday and also search for%0D%0Aa Shaykh (spiritual mentor and guide) with whom one can easily relate and%0D%0Aattempt to acquire from him the love of Allah, the constant consciousness of%0D%0AHis presence and the reality of Tawakkul.%0D%0A"
