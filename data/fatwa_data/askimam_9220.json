There is no harm to enter the restroom if the paper containing the Qur?aanic Aayat is concealed within the clothes.\n\n2. Allah Alone is Shafee (the curer). The prescription is just a means of solving our difficulties. Once the purpose is achieved, the paper should be removed. However, one should continuously make Du?aa to Allah to protect one from calamities.\n\n3. Once you have made Istighfaar, that is sufficient to cleanse you from wrongdoing.\n\n4. One may recite the Qur?aan from memory without Wudhu.\n\n5. It is Sunnat to recite Bismillah after Surah Faatiha.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
