It is also very difficult for woman to accept this today especially as women are brought up in a westernized or cultural environment, not prepared for a polygamous situation considering this; it is possible that you probably have lost your self confidence and self esteem.

In fact generally through observation one sees the importance the husband places with the 1st wife because she has been a pillar of strength from youth through difficulties and success, and further she is the mother of his children. Hence you hold a very special place in his heart.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. A common mistake women in polygamous marriages make, they start to compare and compete with the other women wondering what the short falls are, rather take the extra time that you now have to spend on yourself. When last did you have time for yourself besides sacrificing your time between husband, home, children and other possible work or chores. Often women tend to neglect themselves.%0D%0A%0D%0A4.
