  "answer": "QUESTION\nDoes night begin after maghrib or isha salaat? 1 Is there a hadith that says that blood breaks wuzu? 2 How can someone tell if his practices, specifically his ibadat are under, influenced, or done with a clear and good understanding, belief, or faith in tawheed and correct niyah? 3 How can someone make the practice of tahajjud come regularly and easily into their daily ibadat? 4 When traveling what was the Nabi SAW practice regarding the Sunnah salah? 5 What are the etiquettes to saying phrases like Allahu Akbar, Inshallah, Bismillah, Al Hamdo lillah, Mashallah, Subhanallah, Allahu Alim, and such, when should these be said and is there times or certain situations that one of these may be improper or against sunnah to use. If I said for example I will do this bismillah, would there be different implications or obligations on me, from saying for example I will do this inshallah? Or saying at some accomplishment mashallah is there different implications or obligations from saying subhanallah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Wudhu becomes necessary with the flowing of blood.? In view of this Hadith, by flowing blood, the Wudhu becomes nullified.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Judging a person?s dedication to good actions and his intentions is a factor solely judged by Allah. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Verily, Allah does not look at your appearance and body, but Allah looks at your actions and intentions.? Therefore, we should continue doing good actions with the hope that Allah accepts this solely for his pleasure.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. For anything to happen, dedication and commitment are 2 vital components. You take it upon yourself that at night after a certain time at no cost, I will remain asleep. By keeping this in front of you, it will be difficult for you to remain asleep.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. The Fuqahaa mention if a person is in a hurry while travelling, he could omit the Sunnah Salaat. However, if a Musaafir (traveller) is not rushing, he should perform the Sunnah Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. It is Adaab (etiquettes) to say these words on different occasions. One should be aware of the meaning of the various sayings are use it in proper context. If an inappropriate word is used in the wrong context, there is no sin or harm.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
