  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nMy father was robbed at gunpoint last week outside his check cashing and money transfer store and the robbers took $150,000 in checks and $6200 in cash. Alhumdullilah, my father was not hurt but the checks that they stole are worthless to the robbers because they cannot be cashed. Is there any specific dua we can recite to have the checks found by somebody or returned to us? Is there anything else we should do?\n\nAlso, we had planned on making Hajj this year and had already made two payments to the travel agency but now we cannot afford it and need our money back. The travel agency is refusing to give us our first payment back citing that it was nonrefundable. Is this right?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nRead the following dua to find your missed items.\n\nوعن ابن عمر عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم في الضالة أنه يقول:\n\nاللَّهُمَّ رَادَّ الضَّالَّةِ , وَهَادِيَ الضَّلالَةِ تَهْدِي مِنَ الضَّلالَةِ ,\n  ارْدُدْ عَلَيَّ ضَالَّتِي بِقُدْرَتِكَ وَسُلْطَانِكَ , فَإِنَّهَا مِنْ عَطَائِكَ وَفَضْلِكَ\n\nAllahumma Raadad Daalla, Wa Haadiya ad-dalala Tahdee min ad-dalalah\nUrdud ῾ala Daalatee Biqudratika Wa sultanika, Fa innahaa min ῾ataa’ika Wa Fadlika\n\nالمعجم الكبير - (ج 12 / ص 340(\n\n \n\nIf the condition was already stipulated before hand by the Travel Agency\n\nor it is the normal practice of the Travel Agencies in your area that the first payment is non refundable, then the Travel Agency has the right to claim it. However, if such a condition is not there, and neither is it norm of the trade in your area, then we will require more information about the conditions in the actual contract.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl.
