  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam Alaikum I have the following two queries please send me the reply ASAP. 1)In which direction (North, South, West, East) we should face while taking the bath (ghusul)? 2)Can we offer Khaza salaat after Asar salaat? Allah hafiz Rayees Ahmed\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If one does not have any clothing on whilst taking a bath (Makrooh), then he should not face Qiblah nor should his back be towards the Qibla. However, if he has some clothes on, then there isn?t anything wrong in facing the Qiblah. (Bahrul-raaiq)\n\n2. After the Asr Salaat and before the sun starts changing colour, there is nothing wrong in performing Qadhaa Salaats. The sun starts changing colour approximately 20 minutes before sunset. At this time, one should not perform Qadhaa Salaat until after sunset. (Tahtawi)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
