  "answer": "QUESTION\nAround 2 months ago, I saw a dream that my family and I were travelling to Madinah by car. But I am not sure if it was for religious purpose. Along the trip we stopped under a huge mountain (which r in live present along the road from Jeddah to Madina) to pray?there were many people there. I don?t remember this part very clearly, but I think Prophet Mohammed (SAW) was among those people?.although I never saw him?I just heard that he was there. But what I definitely remember is that I heard is name for sure. I know that this might not be a significant dream for Mufi People like you, but to me this dreams means a lot. So could pls specifically tell me how this dream relates to me? 1) You mention in your answers that things are prohibited, non-permissible and haram?what is the difference between these. 2) Also, I become very depressed when I hear about the horrific things which are happening against our Muslim brothers and sisters in the world?why isn?t Allah(SWT) helping them?.is Allah(SWT) not happy with our Ummah. 3) What can I as a Muslim Female do to help these brothers and sisters?am I allowed to start a petition? Could u pls kindly answer all my questions?.Jazakahllah Brother?and may Allah(SWT) be pleased with you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly resubmit your dreams after Hajj, as Mufti Ebrahim Desai Saheb is%0D%0Acurrently away.%0D%0A1. Haraam is used in its technical meaning. The terms, 'prohibited' and%0D%0A'non-permissible' are used more broadly and can be used for Haraam or%0D%0AMakrooh. If you have a doubt, please enquire with particular reference to%0D%0Awhich answer is meant.%0D%0A2. Your concern is a sign of your Imaan. Allah Ta'ala has wisdom behind all%0D%0Aaffairs. At times, adversity is in the best interest of the slave. By means%0D%0Aof these adversaries, true Mu'mineen are exposed from the Munaafiqeen. The%0D%0Asins of the Mu'mineen are wiped away by these calamities and their status%0D%0Aelevated. They, thus, become deserving of Jannah without reckoning. Every%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) of Allah Ta'ala, as well as their%0D%0Acompanions went through untold trials and tests. This is our purpose here on%0D%0Aearth. However, as far as the Aakhirat (hereafter) is concerned, success%0D%0Awill lie only and only with the Mu'mineen.%0D%0A3. If petitioning does not cause you to violate any of the laws of Purdah%0D%0A(Hijaab), then you may petition. However, generally, these avenues do not%0D%0Abear constructive fruit. You have underestimated the power of Du'aa. Your%0D%0Acontribution through Du'aa is indeed valuable, and should not be deemed%0D%0Atrivial. In brief, every act of obedience and worship from your side will be%0D%0Aa means of drawing the mercy of Allah Ta'ala on this Ummah. Note: Avoid all%0D%0Aforms of mass media, since these are designed to be negative and create%0D%0Adespondency amongst the Muslimeen. There is a lot of good taking place as%0D%0Awell, of which we are not exposed to.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Imraan Vawda%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Muhammad Kadwa"
