  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Ebrahim Sahab, As-Salaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. I am a regular reader of Dharb-I-Mumin (Pakistan) and through it I am inspired to go for Jihad, Al-Hamdulillah. But I want know what are my social and family obligations before going. I am unmarried but engaged. My Mother has been expired (May Allah Subhanahu Ta?ala forgive her sins) and Father is having sufficient personal income for his needs. I hope you will advise me considering your son. May Allah (Subhanahu Ta?ala) accept your efforts for serving the Ummah and reward you with His utmost blessing here and hereafter, Amin. Was Salaam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nAt present, Jihaad, in the different parts of the Muslims world is\nFardh-e-Kifaayah. That obligation is being fulfilled by some Muslim\nMujahideen. Since you are unmarried and have no social obligation, you may\ncontribute in Jihaad in any and every possible way.\n\nWe advise you also make Istikhaara before deciding on any step.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
