  "question": "1) What are Naats? What is the 'Salaam' that is read after Namaaz in some of Indian Mosques? Are naats and Salaam the same thing?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSorry for so many Q's in a single submission, it is because i was waitin for more than a month to ge the oppurtunity to ask my Questions to a respected Imaam like you. Finally I got the time.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nNaat literally means to describe. Poems describing or praising Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) are normally referred to as Naats. The salaam\nthat you refer to is the salutations conferred upon Rasulullah (Sallallaahu\nAlayhi Wasallam) collectively by a group of people.\n\nThe first (Naat) is permitted whilst the second (salaam) is Bid'at and\nshould be avoided. Saying Durood and salaam individually is meritorious.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
