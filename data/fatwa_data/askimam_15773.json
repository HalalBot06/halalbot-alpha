  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf a husband says he does not love youanymore is that grounds for a Talaaq?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf the husband says he does not love you, that does not constitute divorce nor is it a grounds for divorce. You should rather concentrate on the reasons why your husband has made this statement. You should talk to him and discuss the issue. It is possible that some of your actions are hurting and therefore he feels in that way. Many times when there is a lack of communication between husband and wife, simple issues becomes unbearable and thus breaks down the relation.\n\nTherefore, engage your husband in a polite and kind way. Win his confidence and he will pour his heart out to you. Similarly, you may also have some issues with him. You may take the opportunity and resolve your feelings with him as well .\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nÂ \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
