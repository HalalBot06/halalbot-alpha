  "question": "What measures do the family of a Muslim woman, who marries an athiest, have to take?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is the islamic ruling concerning this matter? In this particular case, the woman has been married for about 15 yrs and still the family debate about how to treat her. Most of the family have reminded her at the time of the wedding that it's haraam, but she did not change her mind. I don't feel that the family should keep day-to-day contact with her, as it gives the impression to the younger members of the family that it's acceptable. What is the Islamic point of view?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Haraam (strictly prohibited) for a Muslim woman to marry an atheist.\nThe marriage is not valid according to Shari'ah (Islamic Law).\n\nThe relationship between the Muslim woman and the atheist is Zina\n(fornication). When a person commits wrong, every possible effort should be\nmade to stop the person from the wrong. At times, that may be better\nachieved by terminating relationship with the person. In some instances,\nthat may have an opposite effect. We advise that the seniors of the family\nconsult with each other and adopt a unified stand in order to best achieve\ntheir purpose - stopping the wrong or reforming it. Complacence to a wrong\nby the seniors of the family is certainly detrimental to the proper Islamic\nupbringing of young family members.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
