  "question": "Is it permissible to exclude an estranged child from one's will if one suspects that the child is no longer a Muslim?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissible to exclude an estranged child from one's will if one suspects that the child is no longer a Muslim?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n \n\nIn principle, every legitimate Muslim child will inherit from ones Muslim parents even though such a child is estranged for some reason or the other. If the child is a non-Muslim, he/she will not inherit from ones Muslim parents’ estate. A decision should not be based on suspicion. It should be confirmed whether the child is a Muslim or not upon the death of the parents. If a child was a non-Muslim before the death of the parents but also reverted to Islam before the death of the parents, the child will inherit. If one suspects one child being a  non-Muslim, that may be recorded in the will and a mechanism should be put in place to determine the religion of the child in order to determine his/her legitimacy of being an heir of the estate.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalam\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
