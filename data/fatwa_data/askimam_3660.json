  "question": "What is the end time of Ishraq Salaat, and the starting time for Chasht Salaat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI understand the start time for Ishraq is about 20 minutes after sunrise, and the end time of Chasht is before Zawaal. Please correct if I am wrong. I was also told that Ishraq should be offered as two 2-rakat Nafl (2-salaams), and Chasht to be offered as one 4-rakaat Nafl (1-salaam). Once again, please correct my understanding. Jazak-Allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn a lengthy Hadith, Hadhrat Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu) is reported to have said, ?In the morning when the sun rises to the height of that the same as it is at the time of Asr, the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to perform 2 Rakaats (Salaatul Ishraaq). When the sun rose in the east to the height where it is in the west at the time of Dhuhr Salaat, he performed 4 Rakaats (Salaat al-Dhuhaa, Chast).? (Shamaail Tirmidhi, Hadith No.271)%0D%0A%0D%0AAccording to the Fuqahaa (jurists) and Muhadditheen (scholars of Hadith), the time for Salaat al-Dhuhaa is from the morning after the Makrooh time passes till Zawaal. But according to the Sufis they is the time for two separate Salaats, one is Ishraaq and the other is Dhuhaa. The Sufis substantiate their view from the abovementioned Hadith of Hadhrat Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu) and other narrations. (Khasaail Nabawiy pg.292)%0D%0A%0D%0AIshraaq Salaat%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said that Allah Ta?ala says, ?O son of Aadam, perform 4 Rakaats of Salaat (Ishraaq) in the early part of the day. I shall help you in accomplishing all your responsibilities during the rest of the day.? (Mishkaat pg.116)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another narration of Tirmidhi, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, ?He who performs Fajr Salaat with Jamaat and remains seated in the same place while engaging in Dhikr until after sunrise and thereafter performs 2 Rakaats Nafil Salaat, (Ishraaq), he will obtain the Thawaab of one Hajj and one Umrah.? (Tirmidhi).%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the above Ahaadith, we learn that the number of Rakaats to be performed are 2 or 4 Rakaats, and the Mustahabb method of performing it is to remain seated in your place of Salaat after Fajr and engage in Dhikr, etc. until sunrise. Then, approximately, 10-15 minutes after sunrise perform 2-4 Rakaats. ?If a person gets occupied in some worldly activity after the Fajr Salaat, and after sunrise he offers Ishraaq Salaat, this will also be permissible although the reward will be less.? (Bahishti Zewar part2 pg.30)%0D%0A%0D%0ADhuhaa Salaat%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Anas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Whoever performs 12 Rakaats of salaat al-Dhuhaa, Allah Ta?ala will build for him a castle of gold in Jannah.? (Mishkaat pg.116)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is reported that Hadhrat Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha) used to perform 8 Rakaats of Salaat al-Dhuhaa. She said that even if her parents arose from the grave, she would not leave Salaat al-Dhuhaa to go and meet them. (Ibid). Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, ?Whoever offers 2 Rakaats of Salaat al-Dhuhaa, all his sins will be forgiven even though they are as much as the foam of the sea.? (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0A?Salaat al-Dhuhaa consists of 2 ? 12 Rakaats and it is preferable to perform 8 Rakaats.? (Raddul Mukhtaar vol.1 pg.505)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Mustahabb (preferred) time of performing Salaat al-Dhuhaa is after 1%2F4 of the day has passed. This is deduced from a Hadith of Muslim. (Halabi; Sharah Kabeer pg.390). From many Ahaadith, we understand that Salaat al-Dhuhaa should be performed after the sun has risen quiet high. Because the Fuqahaa and Muhadditheen are of the opinion that the commencement of the time of Salaat al-Dhuhaa is the same as that of Ishraaq (i.e. immediately after sunrise), the Ulama have stated that ?if due to lack of time, one performs the Salaat of Ishraaq and Dhuhaa together at one time, that too will be correct.?
