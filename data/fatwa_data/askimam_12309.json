  "question": "Ghusul faraz or not after watching porno",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsslamu Alykum, I know it is haram to watch pornography, but even though I pray 5 times a day I just got addicted. You already said many suggestions about this topic. I am sorry to say that I do this. What would be the easy way get rid of this. I was planning to buy some software to bloc pornography from my computer, but I could not find one. I want to know one thing to stay clean=if mazi comes after watching porno is GHUSUL is a FARZ or washing legs will be fine. Also, is it permissible to play Indian game= Caram Board\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The secretion of Mazi does not invalidate the Ghusl. It invalidates the Wudhu. The private parts and soiled portions with Mazi must also be washed.\n\n2. It is permissible to play caram board on condition there is nothing un-Islamic done during playing. Furthermore, one must not be unmindful of Salaat. If there is anything un-Islamic done while playing caram board or it leads to missing the Salaat, then it will not be permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
