  "answer": "QUESTION\nDuring a Bayaan, I heard this story: A Sahabi asked his wife for some to eat, and she said there was nothing in the house. He went to the Masjid prayed 2 rakaat, came back, still there was nothing> >>He figured there was something wrong with his Salaat, so he went back to the Masjid prayed 2 more Rakaats and came back home and asked his wife again. He found that the wheat grinder (chakki) he had in his house started operating by itself and was churning out flour that filled up every container in the house. Is this a true story? What is it?s source and chain of narrations? What was the name of the Sahabi?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis narration has been recorded by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad (Hadith10606), Imaam Bazzaar in his Musnad (Majma-uz-zawaaid vol.10 pg.257), Imaam Bayhaqi in Dalaailun-Nubuwwah (Bidaayah wan Nihaaya vol.4 pg.119), Imaam Tabrani in al-Majma-ul Awsat (Hadith5588). Also refer to Hayaatus sahaaba vol.3 pg.642 ? 642\n\nIn fact, what is mentioned is that the wife of that Sahaabi turned to Allah Ta?ala and asked from him instead of asking from the creation and in this way Allah Ta?ala sustained them.\n\nHafiz Haythami has regarded all the narrators of Musnad Ahmad as reliable. (Majmauz-zawaaid vol.10 pg.257)\n\nWe are unable to establish the name of the Sahaabi.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
