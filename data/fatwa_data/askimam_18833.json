  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would just like to know that when your water breaks when going into labour, is the liquid that is released paak Is it neccessry for you to take ghusl when this happens, what is the islamic rulings on this matter.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nThe water liquid released prior to delivery of a child is Najis (impure) (Fataawa Hindiyyah Vol.1 Page 51-Ilmiyyah). The release of the liquid will invalidate the Wudhu not Ghusl (bath).\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n\n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftāa"
