  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n\nIam writing this to you for an issue my sister is facing and she is totally disturbed.\n\nShe performs salah regulary 5 times adn is very much religius,follows islamic instructions\nstrictly.\nHowever for the last two month she is disturbed and keeping quite,even not speakign much\nwith other family members and when we enquire she says that she is facing problem during namaz and cant\nkeep her wadu.\nShe goes for Wadu every 5 minutes and is not satisfied with her Namaz as she is confused whether tha namaz\nwas valid or the wadu broken.\nEven she changed her behaviour and she think she is doing sin as her Salah is not presentable infront of Allah.\nMy entire family is disturbed and worried about her.Please guided us how to tackle this ,even we contated one of the Mufti's\nlocally and he too adviced that this may be the act of satan to divert her attention and misguide her but still she is not convinced\nand worried about Salah.\nPelase provide us complete solution for this.\nJazak Allah\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nIt is not possible for us to offer an advice regarding your sister as we do not know what is her actual problem. Does her wuzu actually break or is she in doubt? She could email us directly or she should consult a local Mufti or Aalim and discuss the issue personally.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa, Madrassah In'aamiyyah"
