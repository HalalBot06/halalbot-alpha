  "question": "If a husband has become a shia during the marriage, is that sufficient grounds for the wife to be granted a faskh?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAll Shi?as are not non-Muslims. In the case mentioned, if the husband adheres to the beliefs of those Shi?as who are still regarded as Muslims, he becomes a Faasiq (flagrant sinner). Sinning is not a valid reason for the faskh (annulment) of the Nikah.\n\nHowever, if he embraces the beliefs of those Shi?as who are regarded as non-Muslim, he is also declared a non-Muslim. In such a case, there is no need for Faskh as the Nikah has automatically terminated by his Kufr.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
