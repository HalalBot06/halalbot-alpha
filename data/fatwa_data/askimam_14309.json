  "question": "Can an animal (venison)be eaten that was shot with a bow & arrow?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan an animal (venison)be eaten that was shot with a bow & arrow? Or does the person have to recite the dua before shooting it?\n\nIf a non muslim shoots the animal with a bow & arrow, can it be eaten or not?\n\nÂ \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn order for an animal to become permissible for consumption (Halal) through being shot by an arrow, the following conditions will have to be fulfilled:\n\n1. The hunter must be a Muslim or from Ahl al-Kitab (Christian or Jew) 2. He must not deliberately leave out the name of Allah when releasing the arrow. If he left it out forgetfully, then he would be excused.Note that the name of Allah has to be taken simultaneously with the release of the arrow.\n\nIf he deliberately delayed it, then the animal would not be halal.\n\n3. The animal must be one whose consumption is permitted in Shari'ah.\n\n4. The arrow must wound the prey.\n\n5. The hunter must continue pursuing the prey until he catches up with it.\n\nIf he takes a break and then finds it dead, it will not be Halal.\n\n6. If he finds the prey alive, he must slaughter it, in the same manner as other animals like sheep etc are slaughtered.\n\nThe answer to your questions would thus be:\n\n1. If the person deliberately didn't take the name of Allah- even if it was because of his not knowing that he had to take it- the animal would not be halal.\n\n2. If the non-Muslim is a Christian or Jew who took into consideration all the other conditions eg.taking the name of Allah when shooting, pursuing the animal etc, then the prey would be halal, otherwise not.\n\nRef: Rad al-Muhtar Vol. 6 Pg. 461-470.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Husain Kadodia\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
