  "question": "Is the commission that one earns from selling life insurance policies, retirement annuities, etc. considered haraam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalaam mu alaikum\n\nIs the commission that one earns from selling life insurance policies, retirement annuities, etc. considered haraam? Is it permissible for one to work for an insurance consultant as an adminstrator/secretary considering that the main source of income from this business is through commission from promoting and selling such products?\n\nJazak Allah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nConventional Insurance Policies and Retirement Annuities contain elements of gambling and interest. These are Haraam in our Shariah. It is not permissible to sell, or accept commission on insurance policy sales nor work for a company promoting such products.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
