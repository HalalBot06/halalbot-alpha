  "question": "Are men and women allowed to read Salaat together?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was once told by an Alim that a man cannot pray salaat in the same room as a women at home unless it is the wife of the individual due to purdah. Could you please explain this Mas'alah according to Shariah and is it a correct view.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for Ghayr Mahram (strange) males and females to\nperform Salaat in one room without a Hijaab (curtain). Ghayr Mahram males\nand females must observe Hijaab from one another.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
