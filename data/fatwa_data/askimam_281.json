  "question": "In many products available we some E-numbers in the ingredients list. In front of each E-number we find their true meaning except for E-471.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nNone of the food products mention what this E-number (E-471) contains.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe emulsifiers used by the European countries bearing the E numbers are different to the products manufactured in South Africa. The E numbers appearing on the local products have no definite definition i.e. one company defines E 471 to contain a plant base whilst another company defines E 471 to contain animal base. These are approximately 700+- emulsifiers on the market of which half are animal based and half are plant based.\n\nHowever, the overseas products with E numbers correspond to the products manufactured in European countries.\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
