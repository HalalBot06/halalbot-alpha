  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSome people quote this hadith while discussing Khilafah. Please explain the meaning of hadith. Also please tell that if this hadith is sahih or hasan or dha'eef.  \n\nIt is reported by Harith Al-Ash'ari (RAA), that the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam) is reported to have said:  \"I declare obligatory upon you five things; Allah (SWT) has commanded me to do so. They are: Organization (Jama’ah), and listening, and obeying, and making Hijrah and making Jihad for the cause of Allah.\" {This hadith has been included in Mishkat Al-Masabih (Kitaab al-Imarah), Musnad of Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (RA) and the Jame' of Imam Tirmidhi (RA)}\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAt the outset it is important to understand that fighting for Khilafat is not the object of a believer. Our object as Muslims is to please Allah by acting upon His commands and the Sunnah of Rasulullah (Salalaahu Alayhi Wasalam). When we will adopt those actions that please Allah, He will make the entire earth subserviant to us. Allah states in Surah Noor \" Allah promises for those who bring firm faith and do rightoeus deeds that He will make them His vicegerants on the earth\".\n\nThose who strive for these positions should first reflect how strong is their link with Allah. Once the bond of Imaan and good deeds are strenghted in the Muslim Ummah , the entire world will become subserviant to them. otherwise, they should know well that they can strive for many years, nay centuries, they will never achieve their objective.\n\nIt does not pay to be superficial in our approach, be practical. A superfical approach is an exercise in futility.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
