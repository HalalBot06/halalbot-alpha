  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualikum respected mufti saab I loved a girl and got engaged with her because of her good manners. I have done fingering with her which broke her virginity and am now repenting sincerely. And now she doesn?t listen to me..i tell her not to cut her hair she does not listen, she talk rudely with me, fight with me?and now I want to leave her is it allowed?i know that there will be problems after marriage due to her rude manners?can law arrest me or pay fines ect.. and accordind to the shariah is it allowed? JAZAKALLAH KHAIR\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHow do you expect the girl to listen to you when you yourself do wrong with her and violate the laws of Shari?ah? Now you complain about her not listening to you. What example did you set for her? She is now doing what you did and following your example.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf you portray yourself as being pious and holy, you should know that it is prohibited to have any premarital contact. The wisdom of the prohibition is clear from your attitude. You abuse the girl and now decide to dump her just because she is not listening to you! You seem to be more worried about the law arresting you and paying fines. Are you not worried about Allah being All-Seeing? You are not concerned about giving account to Allah in His court? Why don?t you ask about that?%0D%0A%0D%0AOur advice to you is make sincere Tawbah and Istighfaar and fear Allah. The girl should be informed about the Shari?ah laws and terminate all premarital contact. Do not be hasty in making a decision. Discuss the issue with your seniors and also make Istikhaara. You should also realise that in this situation you too are to be blamed.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
