  "question": "Regarding sujood ul-sahw, some say at the end of prayer you say salam once and go into sujdah. Should you again perform salam after this?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nTo the Above qestion it is rather confusing that some say we have to pray after completing the prayer.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, the procedure of Sajda-e-Sahw is to make only one Salaam after reciting the Tashahhud and performing two Sajdas.\nThereafter, repeat the Tashahhud, recite Durood-e-Ebraahim, make Du'aa and complete Salaat by making two Salaams.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
