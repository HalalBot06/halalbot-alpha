I have heard from the mudarris e haram Maulana Makki Al Hijazi that the parting of Qamis of Rasulullah (SAW) was from knee to the middle of the calf. In our language parting is called as 'chak'.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Waiting for Reply\n                                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                                                               Talib-e-dua\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n \n\nDue to Ramadan we are only answering selected queries at the moment.
