  "question": "My friend is telling me not to sleep between Asr and Magrib Prayers. Is there any hadiths which prohibit sleeping between Asr and Magrib Prayers. When the time for Magrib Prayers End.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe have not come across any prohibition in Shari?ah sources for sleeping between Asr and Maghrib Salaat.\n\nHowever, in general, if one fears oversleeping and missing Maghrib Salaat, then he should not sleep after Asr Salaat. The time for Maghrib ends when the red twilight in the horizon disappears.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
