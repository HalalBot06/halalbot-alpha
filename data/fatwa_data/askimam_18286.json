Please advise.\n\n \n\nYour answer in a table format would be really helpful and easy to understand,if convenient.\n\njazakullah khair.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n Assalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nYou need to add up all your wealth, which includes money in the bank, cash, jewelry, etc. and subtract all expenses due until the end of your zakātable year.  If this leftover amount is greater than nisāb (minimum value in order for zakāh to be compulsory), then 2.5% of it will be the zakāh. \n\nFor example, if the following values are income earned and expenses due by the end of your zakāh year, say 1st of Ramadān, then the zakāh will be calculated as such:\n\nWealth on 1st of Ramadān\n\n\n \t\n\nCash\n\n\t\n\n20000\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nJewelry\n\n\t\n\n5000\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nShares\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nExpenses due by 1st of Ramadān\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\t\n\nCar Loan\n\n\t\n\n5000\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\t\n\nCar Lease\n\n\t\n\n300\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\t\n\nUtilities\n\n\t\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\t\n\nRent\n\n\t\n\n500\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\t\n\nCredit Card\n\n\t\n\n600\n\n\n\n\nMoney Leftover on 1st of Ramadān\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\t\n\nLeftover\n\n\t\n\n18500\n\n\n \n\n\n18500 X 2.5% = 462.50.  Your zakāh is $462.50.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
