  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is the islamic ruling concerning Wadhi? Is it secreted only after urination or can it be secreted any time of the day? Furthermore, does one have to wash the particular part of the garment if it is soiled with wadhi? If answer to above questions is yes, isn't it burdensome to keep oneself and garment clean all the time especially for working women who have to offer prayers at the work place?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are three types of secretions; Mani, Mazi and Wadi.\n\nThe secretion when one is aroused is Mazi. The secretion during ejaculation is Mani. The secretion after urine is Wadi. All three secretions are impure. The only difference is the secretion of Mazi and Wadi. Mazi and Wadi invalidates Wudhu and ejaculation of Mani invalidates Ghusl.\n\nIt is simple to keep oneself clean. Abstain from intermingling of sexes, casting of lustful glances, etc. and all those things that cause excitement and secretion of Mazi. A woman may also use disposable liners to absorb secretions and discharges.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
