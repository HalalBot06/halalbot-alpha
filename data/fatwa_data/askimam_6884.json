  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am currently studying in a Canadian University and I would like to know how I can maximize my barakat? Do you have any duaa's I can recite. Would it be possible to obtain them in Arabic in printed form? If so could you please email me so that I can reply to you with my mailing address. Also, I am applying for some top universities in the States for graduate studies. Should a person ask Allah to let things happen for the best, or is it allowed to ask about specifics in regard to admissions to specific universities/programs, etc?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Salaat with Jamaat\n2. Recitation of Surah Yaaseen morning and evening\n3. Also, abstention from sin opens all doors.\n4. You may ask for something specific provided it is within the bounds of the Shari?ah. However, the best would be to ask Allah Ta?ala to choose the best for you.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
