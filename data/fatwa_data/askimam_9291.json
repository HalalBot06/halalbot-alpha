If a large amount of water or flowing water retains its smell, taste and colour after being contaminated with any Haraam or impure substances then the water will be pure and Halaal. (Raddul Muhtaar, Vol. 1, Page 137-138) %0D%0A%0D%0A2. It cannot be said that all waters contaminated with Haraam and impure substances is pure and Halaal as long as its smell, colour and taste are retained. This depends on the amount of water contaminated. If the water is of a large amount (21 sq. meters or more) or it is flowing, then it will be regarded as impure if the Haraam substance or impurity has caused its smell, colour or taste to change, otherwise not. On the contrary, if the water is less than 21 sq. meters (stagnant), then it will be regarded as impure regardless of it retaining its smell, taste or colour. (Raddul Muhtaar, Vol. 1, Page 136) %0D%0A%0D%0A3. It is not permissible for females to wear tight clothing in which the shape of their body (satar) is exposed whether it is in the presence of Mahram or other females. (Aapke Masaail aur Unkaa Hal, Vol. 7, Page 166) %0D%0A%0D%0A4. Dancing, which is prevalent in the present age is not permitted in Islam. %0D%0A%0D%0A5. It will be permissible for females to attend Islamic functions and camps away from home if there is no intermingling with non-Mahram males. Furthermore, it will be necessary for her to travel with a Mahram male if she intends to travel more than 48 miles (77 km). (Raddul Muhtaar, Vol. 5, Page 276) %0D%0A%0D%0A6. It is permissible to normalize the breasts through medication. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Ashraf%0D%0ADARUL IFTA ?
