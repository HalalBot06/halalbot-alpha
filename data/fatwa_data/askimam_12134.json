  "question": "It seems every time I masturbate problems, I feel that a bad thing happens every time I do it (Iâ€™m ashamed). I did it a few days ago and my auntie died few days later. Is this my fault?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nCould you please let me know ASAP, and please can you not put this public. As my brother goes on these sort of sites and may know its me. I wouldn?t like my family to know about it. Jazakallukeer\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two parts to your questions; firstly is that the aspect of masturbation is not permitted in Islam.\n\nAs for the second part the fact that you are masturbating does not effect the death of another person or can cause them any harm all that happens to us is from Allah and not by your actions. We will be accountable for our actions. It is only Allah that can give and take life. So your action of masturbation (which is not permitted) is not your fault.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nShaykh Irshaad Amod / Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
