  "question": "Two of my friends disagree - one says alcohol is worse than haram food, the other says the opposite. I know both are haram, but which is worse?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe term haraam is used when anything is expressly prohibited in the Qur?aan. That is the case with alcohol and other Haraam foods, for example, pig, carrion, etc.\n\nThe spirit of a believer is to express submission and abstain from whatever is Haraam. There is no point in discussing which Haraam is worse than the other. A believer should believe that every Haraam is the worst and abstain from it.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
