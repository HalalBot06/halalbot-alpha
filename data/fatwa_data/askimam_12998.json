  "question": "Is it allowed to live with a non mehram under any circumstance?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy sister and her husband moved into my mom's house in which I (baligh female) lived. My sister?s husband and I observed strict parda and never sat in the same room together or even spoke to each other. Yet, we did mistakenly see each other several times, to the extent that I know what he looks like. We lived like this for a few years. I was told even though we observed parda, it is still against Islam to live in that way because we didn?t have a separate entrance to the house for them and no separate bathroom and also no separate kitchen. I was also told that anything that could lead to zinah is made haraam, and that by living in the same house as a non-mehram it is impossible to not think of them or see them by mistake. So, even if no bad intention is involved, this thinking is also wrong and that is why it is wrong to live with non mehram in the same house. Is this true? Because my sister's husband is going through financial difficulties. What is someone in this situation supposed to do? Does there have to be separate entrance, bathroom, kitchen? Also, if someone comes to visit, can they stay temporarily in the same house that a non-mehram lives in? For example, can my husband and I go visit my mom and live there even if my older sister, who is nonmehram for my husband, lives there? And my sisters husband who is nonmehram for me lives there. If we can stay, then what precautions should we observe? Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYes, it is permissible to live in this manner. However, strict Hijaab regulations will have to be adhered to. Both parties should be considerate of each other. There would obviously be incidents of mistakenly looking at each other.\n\nDo not ever be alone with him under any circumstances. Always ensure that other people are around. Do your utmost to avoid all contact.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
