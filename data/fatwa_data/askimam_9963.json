  "answer": "QUESTION\nif the tongue and navel were pierced not to follow the western society but if done for ones own self,then is there any problem with it,if so wat is the problem and can one fast and perform salaah with these piercings,i previously read that ones actions are judged by their intentions and there is absolutley no intention of doing it for fahion or following a trend,please can the aalim advise me thoroughly on this as ramadhaan is nearing and i have to know soon\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBody piercing is not allowed in Islam, especially, nowadays if it is a trend\nand way of the Kuffaar to do such things. Allah Ta'ala has created us in the\nbest and most perfect manner and we should not interfere with our bodies\nwhich is an Amaanat (trust). We have to look after our bodies and fulfil our\nresponsibilities. We cannot use our eyes to see whatever we fel like. We can't use our ears to hear whatever we feel, etc.\n\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) in many Ahaadith has cursed the\npeople that change their appearance by, e.g. tattooing, joining hairs, i.e.\nwigs from human hair, etc.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
