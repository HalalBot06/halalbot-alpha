  "question": "Should the wife obey the husband if the husband is extreme irrligious?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nShould the wife obey the husband if the husband is extreme irrligious?\n\nIf the husband plays gambling, doesnt say prayer, stays with other women , can the wife avoid his sexual need?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe wife could play an integral role in reforming her husband. If the husband has the bad habits as stated in the email and if the wife honestly feels that if she refuses his sexual needs, that will pressurise him into mending his ways and reforming, then she may do so.\n\nHowever, she should be careful that this approach should not cause her husband to deteriorate further. The wife should also advise and get others to advise him. Allah states, ‘… and continue offering advise for offering advice is beneficial to the believers.’\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
