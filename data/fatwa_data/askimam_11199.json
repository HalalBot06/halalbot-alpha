  "question": "Is there a prescribed method for istinjaa after passing stool ? (i.e sunnat etc)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhile in jamaat we did ?Muzakhara? on istinjaa and we explained how we did istinjaa after passing stool. People were of the opinion that my method is incorrect and cleanliness is not achieved. After passing stool I clean the area with toilet paper to lessen the impurity. Then instead of using all four fingers I wet two fingers and wash / rub the affected area a number of times until I am satisfied. After washing I use toilet paper again and if any impurity was still on the body then this will easily show on the tissue. If impurity is found then I wash the area again until I am sure no impurity is left on the body I don?t actually pour any water onto the body. I only do this after urinating because you can see what you are doing. Please clarify if this method of istinjaa is acceptable. I don?t like to use all four fingers because I am worried about spreading the impurity or impure water on or around the back passage. Is the water on the hand impure or napaak. If the area around the back passage becomes wet by the hand will this area also become napaak. At times after istinjaa I am constantly worried if my istinjaa is done. It plays on my mind. I get frustrated and end up in a depressed mood even with my family members. I have suffered from waswasah in the past with namaaz and wuzu etc is this shaytaan trying to get to me from another angle ? Is the water which is left on the body after istinjaa napaak ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYes, there is a prescribed method of making istinjaa. At the beginning of istinjaa, it is preferable to use toilet paper 3 times. If Istinjaa is done on a hot day, then the person should start from the front to the back and then from the back to the front and the third time from the front to the back. If Istinjaa is done on a cold day, then he should begin from the back to the front. After wiping, he should wash his hand first and then he should cleanse himself with two fingers or three fingers if necessary together with pouring water.When using the two fingers, one should keep the middle finger in front and the ring and index finger behind it. After beginning with the finger in this position, he should bring the ring finger forward and rub with the middle finger and ring finger. Thereafter, he will wipe with the index finger if necessary. He should continue until all the smell and impurities are removed. The left over water is only pure if there is no impurity in it.\n\nÂ \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
