  "question": "On 10th Zilhaj,after pelting the shaytan,doing animal sacrifice&Halq all the restrictions of ihraam have endedâ€“except sexual relations with ones wife.Does this rule apply to woman on Hayd as well?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat I am confused about is, If a woman is on hayd, after doing halaq can she now let material touch her face or does she have to stay in a state of ihraam until she becomes clean and performs ghusl? Also if she is not able to perform the tawaf-ziyarah during the five days of hajj, but does it later on (when paak) does she have to give daam, due to the delay in doing tawaf ziyarah? Pls answer soon because I am leaving for hajj in 2 weeks.May Allah aid & reward you in this.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. After Rami (pelting the Shaytaan) and Halq, it is permissible for a woman to allow material to touch her face even though she is in her monthly cycle (Haydh).\n\n2. Tawaaf-e-Ziyaarah is only done after pelting. Any delay in Tawaaf-e-Ziyaarah shall make Damm necessary. (Hidaaya vol.1 pg.251; Ilmiyyah). However, a woman in her monthly cycle (menses) cannot perform Tawaaf. The delay in her Tawaaf due to menses does not constitute Damm to be necessary. (Shaami vol.2 pg.528; HM Saeed)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
