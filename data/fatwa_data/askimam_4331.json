  "question": "Assalaamalaikum Mufti Sahab. Could a muslim accept an invitation for food from a non-muslim.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nand in another case, Is it permissable for a practising Muslim to accept an invitation for food from a fellow Muslim, whose source of income is from a Restaurant where he also sells Alcohol. In both the cases my main intension to accept the invitation is to get them closer to Islam. Jazakh Allah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShariah has emphasised on eating food that is halaal beyond doubt. To eat\nanything that is haraam or even doubtful is not permissible. If a Muslim is\ninvited by any person, Muslim and non Muslim and one is certain that the\nfood is absolutely halaal, then he/she may accept the invitation. That is\npossible by explaining to the non Muslim's, ones religious convictions of\nhalaal/haraam. It is also important to note that a non-Muslim's word\nregarding halaal and haraam is not acceptable. As regards to accepting a\nMuslim person's invitation, if the major source of income is halaal, then it\nis permissible to accept his invitation. If the conditions in both\ninvitations are fulfilled, the opportunity may then be embraced to advance\nyour good intention of giving advice.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT"
