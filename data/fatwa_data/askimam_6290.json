  "answer": "QUESTION\nJealous and pride are kabeera sin, but what is the solution or cure for it? How can one avoid being jealous or having pride? I think its difficult not to be jealous, I hate being jealous but it just happens and the only thing I do is astaghfaar. But I don't want to be jealous. So, when I hate being jealous and I don't want to be jealous but still get jealous, then what can I do? A person can stop lying by keeping one's mouth shut, A person can stop stealing by controlling ones hand but jealousy comes from within, how can one control it or not be? It's not that I harm anyone by it, and I do say masahallah. Any prayer to cure this??\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJealousy is to wish the next person being deprived of a particular gift or\nbounty. Merely admiring a gift in a person is not jealousy.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
