It will be compulsory upon the husband to provide her these facilities where she will be comfortable. For now she may stay with her parents until he provides appropriate arrangements.\n\n(Bahashti Zewar, Pg. 147, 11th part, Akhtari)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl. Abdur Rahman Shareef,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nConcured by: Ml. Abduz Zaman, Student Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nUnder the guidance of:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai Saheb\nDārul Iftā"
