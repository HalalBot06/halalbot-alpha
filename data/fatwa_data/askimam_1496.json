  "question": "What is \"Karz-e-Hasna?\" Husband's sister gave money to my father-in-law and said, it was Karz-e-Hasna.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Sahib, 1) Before I married my husband, my husband's sister gave some money to my father-in-law to assist them with a personal issue. She said it was Karz-e-Hasna? What is Karz-e-Hasna? 2) Whenever she has an agrument with my father-in-law or my husband or they do not agree with her on something, she orders them that they MUST pay back the money to her? They are not in the position to pay her back at this time? This situation is causing alot of stress. Please guide us. Jazakallah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQardh-e-Hasana literally means a good loan. It generallly refers to making\ncharitable contributions with the intention of gaining the reward in the\nhereafter. It is also used as an interest free loan. According to the\ndetails of your question, since your sister-in-law claims repayment of the\nloan from her father, it appears that she gave them an interest free loan.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT"
