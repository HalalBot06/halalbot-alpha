  "answer": "QUESTION\nAslaamalikum,I'm a non-Muslim gal.Since I was in 9th std. I had wanted to convert to Islam.Now im in love with a Muslim boy,who tought me how n what to pray,even the kalmas that r to b recited for conversions.What should I do to convert without any fights at home?How can I convince my family,who is not ready to even listen to me?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour consideration for reversion to Islam is encouraging. May Allah Ta?ala guide you to the right path and grant you salvation in both the worlds, in this life and the Hereafter, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe do understand that this is world of means, cause and effect. Your consideration to accept Islam is due to your love for the Muslim boy. It is that relationship that has led you to learn some aspects of Islam. However, it is important to point out that your reversion to Islam should be based on your conviction of Islam, its values and ethos. You should sincerely believe in the fundamental tenets of Islam. Your reversion to Islam should not be only because of love for the boy. You are intelligent enough to understand that love is a relative issue, and often increases and decreases. At times, love is also lost. Such a situation should not shake your faith in Islam. If you understand Islam and its requisites, you should first accept Islam and do not make that subordinate to your love for the person. %0D%0A%0D%0AReverting to convincing your family, it is difficult as there is much prejudice between Muslims and Hindus in India. Nevertheless, you should bring the courage and think of ways to communicate your feeling for the boy to your parents. If you feel they are not agreeable and you will not be able to follow Islam whilst living with your parents, then you should consider leading an independent life in which you could practise on Islam and also marry the person of your choice. We do understand that our advice is easier written than practiced, but sacrifice is essential for eternal salvation and the great rewards of the Hereafter.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
