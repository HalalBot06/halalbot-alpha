  "question": "In what category does marriage fall into for a person who despite fasting still has strong desires?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) Kindly explain the hadith in which it is stated that thayyibas are more inclined to men.\n\n2) In what category does marriage fall into for a person who despite fasting still has strong desires? What should he do if a suitable partner is not found as yet?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nWe do not know which Hadith you are referring to. Kindly be specific.\n\nIf a person still has the urge to commit Haraam despite fasting, it is Wajib for such a person to make Nikah if he has the means to do so. He should make a serious effort to find a suitable partner. We observe that many people despite having the urgency to marry still display laxity in searching for a partner. Until a suitable partner is found, you should continue with the fasting. You should read those Ahadith that instill the fear of Allah in oneself and consciousness of accountability in the Court of Allah in the hereafter. Furthermore, you should identify a pious, Allah fearing Alim in whom you have confidence and contact and explain to him your difficulty. He will guide you and assist you in removing the evil whispers of Shaytaan.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
