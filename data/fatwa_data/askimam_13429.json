  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI find comfortable wearing lungi now, in begganing I din'd like it but then I heard from people saying that was the sunna of Prophet (SAW) then I force my self to wear the lungi, but I wontder is it nessesary to wear under garment since the private parts expose under neat to the groundÂ specially when I get ready for salaat I feel like wearing under garment, and after salaah I takes it off, is it okay to do that?.\n\nand same with thob the (Abiya) I like to wear the thob also specially for Jummah and Eid salaah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. There is no problem in wearing an under garment either in Salaat or out of it. However, it is not necessary even if the private parts are exposed to the ground. Once you wear the Lungi, your Satr is concealed from the gaze of others.\n\n2. You are welcome to wear a thob for any Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
