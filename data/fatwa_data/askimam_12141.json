  "question": "I earned money from illegal source. Is it halal. Please see the attached description of my income and advice.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI work for a trading company who use agents to facilitate business by help of those agents on commission basis. On behalf of my company I appointed agents for the businesses I am responsible for. During the agent?s appointment I made an unofficial agreement with them that, they have to share the commission with me which they will get from my company. This is without the knowledge of my company. Is this income halal for me (as I am taking share from the commission of the agent with his agreement). I have invested those money in property. If it is haram income what can I do to make those property halal?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe money you are receiving from these agents is in reality bribery for the job, thus it is Haraam. Nabi (sallalahu Alaihi wasallam) has cursed those who receive bribes.(Tirmizi 3/622, Abu Dawud 3/300, Ibn Majah 2/775, Haakim 4/115). The money was forced out of them as if they wanted the job they had to bribe you by giving you a portion of their commission. Thus this money in reality belongs to them and you have acquired it in a haraam manner.\n\nIt will be necessary for you to return the money to those from whom you took it. (Aap ker Masaail Vol.6 Pg.172, 177) This money can be paid out from any other money of yours, it will not be necessary to sell those properties. Make sure that you return the money to every person from whom you took it and also ask Allah Ta'ala for forgiveness. It is not worth destroying your Hereafter for the petty gains of this world.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
