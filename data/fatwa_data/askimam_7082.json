You may try to ask her to talk about the issues but if she is at a stage of beating you and your mother she needs help to solve the problems.\n\nSo you need to go to your local Ulema and seek this assistance. May Allah keep us on right path.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nShaykh Irshaad Amod / Moulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
