  "question": "Do you have to be in the state of Wudhu to teach someone how to pray?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nwhen you are showing someone how to pray namaz do you need wudu,and is it neccessary to face the qibla?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is not necessary to be in the state of wuzu when teaching one how to perform salah. It is also not necessary to face the kaba. However, it is important to inform the person that wuzu and facing the Qiblah are prerequisites for the validity of salah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
