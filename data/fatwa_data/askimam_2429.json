  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAfter the obedience of Allah, Du'aa in itself is among the best ways of%0D%0Akeeping contact with Allah. 'Whenever my servants ask of me, I am indeed%0D%0Aclose. I answer the prayer of the caller when calls unto me.' (Baqarah 186)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe more a person remembers Allah and begs of Him, the closer he becomes to%0D%0AAllah. A person's closeness to Allah Ta'ala will manifest in his obedience%0D%0Ato Allah's commands. When a person lives according to the dictates of Allah%0D%0ATa'ala, the angels themselves make Du'aa for his forgiveness. They say, 'Our%0D%0ARabb, Your Mercy surrounds all things. so forgive those who repent and%0D%0Afollow your path and save them from the torment of the fire.' (40; 7). In%0D%0Asuch a situation, when a Mu'min begs for forgiveness, his supplications are%0D%0Areadily accepted.%0D%0A%0D%0AHereunder is a Du'aa to assist you in this regard:%0D%0A%0D%0AAllaahumma anta rabbiy laa ilaaha illaa anta. Khalaqtaniy wa ana abduka, wa%0D%0Aanaa alaa 'ahdika wa wa'dika ma-statwa-tu. A'oodhu bika min sharri maa sana'%0D%0Atu, aboo-u laka bini'matika 'alayya wa aboo-u bidhanbika faghfirliy innahuu%0D%0Alaa yaghfiru dhunooba illaa anta.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above Du'aa is known as Sayyidul Istighfaat (the leader among%0D%0Asupplications seeking forgiveness) and should be recited morning and evening%0D%0Aor during the day and night or both.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
