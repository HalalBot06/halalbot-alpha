  "answer": "QUESTION\nassalamalaikum, i came across a hadith in sahih muslim book 8 # 3472 that \"had it not been for bani israel food had not gone stale and had it not been for Eve women would not have been unfaithful toward her husband.\" could u please elaborate this hadith regarding Eve's unfaithfullness. Also in Sahih Bukhari in volume 7 book 62#30 it says \"evil omen is in 3 things, women, horse and house. \" Can u please explain this hadith? jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe correct translation of the aforementioned Hadith of Sahih Muslim is,%0D%0A'Had it not been for Eve, women would not be a deception to their husbands.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThe learned scholars of Hadith have explained this Hadith to be a reference%0D%0Ato what had transpired in Jannah when Adam (Alayhis salaam) and Hawa%0D%0A(Alayhas salaam) were prohibited from partaking of a certain tree therein.%0D%0AHowever, Shaytaan (who had just taken an oath that he would mislead man)%0D%0Adeceived Hawa (Alayhis salaam) into eating from that very tree, and she in%0D%0Aturn convinced Aadam (Alayhis salaam) as well into the same. Hence, this%0D%0Abecame the means of them both being taken out of Jannah.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs understood from this, Hadhrat Hawa (Alayhis salaam) was the means of the%0D%0Amistake of Aadam (Alayhis salaam) and due to that all the women of the world%0D%0Abeing her children, the same quality is found in them as well.
