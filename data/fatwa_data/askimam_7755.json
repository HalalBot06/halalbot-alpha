  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn general, in respect to the Aakhirat, men and women are equal. Allah Ta?ala accepts the good deeds of both equally. However, as far as the world is concerned, Allah has created each of the genders for a different role and function, and has granted men a status over men.\n\nAllah Ta?ala has made such an arrangement out of his wisdom. Where can our feeble and limited intellect ever compare with the all-encompassing wisdom of Allah Ta?ala.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
