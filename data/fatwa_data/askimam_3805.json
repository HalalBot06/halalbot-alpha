  "question": "What determines the boundry of a town or city? Several cities are very large and one could be a musafir just travelling from one end to the other eg. Johannesburg?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it the boundry of the city itself or the suburb. In other words if I were to travel from a suburb in the East of Jhb to a suburb in the west of Jhb and the distance were to be more than 48miles would I be a musafir? Is the criteria of 48miles applied to the distance travelled to reach the destination or the direct distance to the place I am going to i.e. as the crow flies.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf there is a distance of one Galwa (appr. 137 meters) between the town and\nsuburb, then the suburb will be considered independent, i.e. once the person\nleaves the boundary of the city, then he will perform Qasr Salaat.\n\nBut if the suburb is linked to the city, i.e. there is a distance of lesser\nthan 1 Galwa then the suburb will be considered as part of the city, i.e. if\nhe is in the suburb, then he will still be considered a Muqeem. Generally,\nthere is a separation of at least one Galwa between the town and suburb.\nTherefore, the suburbs are very closely linked to the city. One will have to\nmake Qasr when he leaves the town and vice versa.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
