Nabi ( sallallahu alayhi wasallam ) has mentioned ten rewards for the one who initiates the salaam with the words Assalaamu Alaikum, twenty rewards for the one who adds Wa Rahmatullah and thirty rewards for adding Wa Barakatuh. (Abu Dawood, Vol 13, Pg 212)\nIt is an accepted rule that to acquire something one has to make an effort. Therefore acquire knowledge of Deen and Dunya, it is imperative for one to make an effort to pursue the knowledge one wishes to attain. However for the knowledge of Deen, together with making an effort, if one practices on what he knows and is pious and fears Allah, then Allah Ta’lah will bless him with unseen knowledge. Allah mentions in the Quran, “Fear Allah.”\nMany practices and wazeefas of our pious elders have proven beneficial and the desired result attained. However, these practices and wazeefas are merely the experiences and tests of these pious Ulama. Although it is permissible to act on these practices, it is not proven from the Shariah, and therefore shall not be regarded as part of Deen.\nTo give proxy attendance is not permitted as this is akin to deception. Nabi ( sallallahu alayhi wasallam ) has mentioned, “(He) who deceives is not from amongst us. The object of role call is to ensure that every student is present for the lesson and by appointing a proxy, the object is defeated. One should value ones time and avoid wasting time in trivial amusement. If a person wastes his time, then he has no one but himself to blame. If a person values and manages his time correctly by drawing up a schedule then one will derive maximum benefit and will Inshallah be able to attend all the classes.\nTaqdeer (pre destiny) is a matter known to Allah and part of our faith. It is our responsibility as bondsmen of Allah to worship and obey him in every aspect of our lives in order to attain Allah’s happiness. Allah has kept rewards for acting on some forms of ibaadah, but the reward for such actions can be destroyed by a person committing sins, like a person who eats nutritious food to stay healthy but at the same time also consumes poison. Therefore, together with constantly worshiping Allah, one should refrain from any act that can destroy ones good deeds. The pleasure of Allah can be achieved only by obeying Him and following the Sunnah of Rasulullah ( sallallahu alayhi wasallam )\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
