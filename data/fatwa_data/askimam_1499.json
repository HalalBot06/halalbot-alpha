  "question": "Is there any proof or indication in the Quran that supports or validates the Imammat or the Imams?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nQuranic reference will be most appreciated.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n?Imaamate? is an incorrect belief of the Shi?as. Shi?as are not Muslims. Kindly refer attached, ?Unbridgeable Divide?.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AUNBRIDGEABLE DIVIDE%0D%0AThe protracted contrariety between Islam and Shi?ism is but a clear reflection of fundamental differences between the two. The only common denominator between Islam and Shi?ism is the Islamic Kalimah. The rest of Shi?ism has very little in common with mainstream Islam. The unbridgeable divide between the two is entrenched in some of the core fundamentals of this sect, such as:* THE TWELVE IMAAMS%0D%0AImaamah is a divine station like Nubuwwat. This implies that Sunnis, who do not believe in Imaamah, are unbelievers. According to their beliefs, Allah had chosen twelve men to succees Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). The twelfth Imaam however disappeared at the age of five. He is believed to be the awaited Mahdi.%0D%0A* THE STATUS OF THE IMAAMS%0D%0AThe Imaams possess more knowledge than the Ambiyaa. They are superior to the Ambiyaa and the entire creation. The Imaams can bring the dead back to life. No knowledge of the heavens and the earth is hidden from them.%0D%0A* THE INTERPOLATION OF THE NOBLE QUR?ANThe Qur?an is incomplete and distorted in its present form. This tenet had been explicity propounded by the classical scholars of Shi?ism, but frugally denied by the contemporary scholars.* VILIFICATION AND APOSTASY OF THE SAHAABA%0D%0AThe Sahaaba were guilty of wilfully distorting and corrupting the Deen of Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). They turned renegade after the demise of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) except the immediate household of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A* THE PERMISSIBILITY OF MUT?A* VIRTUES OF TAQIYYA%0D%0AIslam and Shi?ism are two parallel streams of thought that can never converge. They are as distinct from each other, as is Islam to the Ahlul-Kitaab.To ignore these differences is to ignore the stark reality.The often repeated hallowed call for \"Muslim Unity\" simply serves as a smokescreen, behind which Shi?a missionaries penetrate Muslim societies. Any attempt to resist this imposition is branded as \"divisive\". Would it be divisive to protect Islam from a sect that inherently debases the Qur?an, the Ambiyaa, and the Sahaaba? Unity can only be forged on the basis of Aqeedah (belief). To label these differences as ?hair splitting issues? is to undermine the sanctity of the Qur?an, the Ambiyaa and the Sahaaba unity at the cost of the Qur?an is tantamount to blasphemy.The constitution of our country guarantees religious freedom. The Shi?as therefore have the right to propagate their beliefs. However, they need to come out of the closet and do so under the banner of Shi?ism.Issued by: UUCSA"
