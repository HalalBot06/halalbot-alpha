  "question": "Please explain in detail the definition of Riba.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPeople don't understand the difference between Interest and Riba. My understanding is when an Owner is financing, he can use any 'interest rate' to set his profit. Riba gets in the picture if the financing is done by a third party (This is when, ONE FORSAKES THE PROPHET FOR PROFIT).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Every loan that draws a profit is Riba and Haram'.\n\nThe Hadith is general. It includes the direct party being the owner as well as the third party.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
