  "question": "is it haram to buy something from someone knowing it had been stolen? whether a bike, a stereo system, etc, is it haram?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn Islam, it is prohibited to purchase anything that has been stolen. Reason\nbeing the way the person got that article to sell was gained by Haraam\nmeans.\n\nHe is not the owner of that article nor was he mandated to sell that article\nby the owner. So, to purchase such an article is totally prohibited.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
