  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n\nhow did the prophet (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) have his hair? from what i heard from some hadith it was long and curly, and then i also heard he shaved it? and if i want to have sunnat hair how should i grow it? is it haram to have uneven hair? if so wat is the punishment? major or minor sin?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1. There are three different lengths of hair mentioned regarding the hair of Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) \na. till the middle of the ears,\nb. till the earlobes and\nc. till the shoulders.\n2. The hair of Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam)  was generally long and wavy, not completely curled nor completely straight.\n3. Commentors of the hadith mentioned that since the time of hijrah (or rather the last ten years of the life of Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) , his blessed hair was shaved four times only, three times due to having performed Umrah and the forth time due to having performed Hajj. Other than these four occasions the hair was only trimmed once.\n4. An equal length of hair must be maintained on all sides of the head. That than this is not permitted and is a major sin.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
