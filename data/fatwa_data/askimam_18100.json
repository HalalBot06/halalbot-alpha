  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nprayin fajr salaat beomes diffiuclt for me as I can't fall asleep.  I also have deep sleep, so when I put the alarm for fajr i don't hear it.  The alarm keeps ringing until later on I notice.  DO i still get the siin and the azaab for missing Fajr salat?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAlhamdulillāh, you should thank Allāh Ta’ālā for giving you the concern (fikr) of performing your obligations and for having the fear of committing sins. \n\nYou mention two problems regarding your sleep.  First, you have difficult falling asleep and, second, that you have a deep sleep.  Regarding dealing with these two issues medically, you should consult your doctor and try to find a cure.\n\nOn a practical level, there are several steps you could take to ensure you wake-up for fajr, some of which include:\n\n1.      Try going to bed earlier so that you will be rested enough at fajr time, making it easier to wake-up\n\n2.      If you live with others, assign someone to physically wake you up, instead of just an alarm\n\n3.      Set your alarm earlier so that, by the time you notice it ringing, fajr time will still not have ended\n\n4.      Set multiple alarms and increase the ringer volume\n\n5.      Move your alarm clock farther away such that you have to get out of bed to turn it off\n\n6.      Do not overeat or have a late dinner\n\n7.      As soon as you wake-up, rub your eyes and face.  This will ensure that you become fresh and do not go back to sleep\n\n8.      Try to take a small nap (qaylūlah) in the afternoon\n\n9.      Make tawbah before going to sleep for all the sins committed during the day and make a sincere du’ā to Allāh Ta’ālā to help you wake-up on time\n\n10.  Recite the following du’ā before going to sleep:\n\nرَبِّ اجْعَلْنِي مُقِيمَ الصَّلَاةِ وَمِنْ ذُرِّيَّتِي رَبَّنَا وَتَقَبَّلْ دُعَاءِ\n(Rabbi-j-‘alnī muqīma-s-salātī wa min dhurrīyatī rabbanā wa taqabbal du’ā),\n“O my Lord, make me one who establishes prayer and also from my offspring.  Our Lord, accept my invocation” (Qur’ān 14:40)\n\n \n\nInshāAllāh, with medical advice, practical steps, and sincere intention, you will start to wake-up for fajr.  As long as you are exhausting your efforts in trying to pray fajr on time, inshāAllāh, you will not get sins or punishment for missing fajr in its time.  May Allāh make it easy.  Āmīn.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nMl.
