Yes, Dhikr will be permissible as long as you are not in a state of nakedeness. However, Dhikr should preferably be made in respectable conditions.\n\n2. If the same oil that was used to fry chips was used to fry or cook any Haraam food, it will not be acceptable.\n\n3. The utensils should be washed properly before used, preferably, at least 3 times.\n\n4. It is narrated in Tafseer ibn Katheer that ibn Jareer al-Tabarri (RA) narrates from Hakam (Taabi?ee) that angels descend with the rain. (Surah Hajr Chapter14; Tafseer ibn Katheer).\n\n5. Asmaa can be a name on itself. However, you may join it with Asmaa Khayrun-nisaa.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
