  "answer": "QUESTION\nHaving a gathering called 'matum', it is when someone passes away and people would  visit and read the quran, it is done for 4 days in the deceased house.\n\nWhen someone is pregrant is it wrong to go to a funeral, as some people believe they will have a miscarriage and if the person who had a miscarriage, what should they do, e.g do they need to stay home, are they allowed to visit someone who just had a baby?\n\nCan you tell me if shaitaan wears one shoe, and is it wrong to walk around with one shoe?\n\nDuring Maghrib do u have to turn the lights and close the curtains etc?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The practice of Matum where people gather at the house of the deceased to recite Qur’aan for a specific number of days is incorrect and an act of bid’ah. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] condemned bid’ah and stated the person who practices on bid’ah is astray and deviation.\n\n2. It is permissible for a pregnant woman to attend a funeral. The belief of miscarriage, etc. has no basis in Islam.\n\n3. It is incorrect to wear only one shoe. Anything that is done incorrectly is referred to as an act of Shaytaan as the Shaytaan gets happy with that.\n\n4. It is not necessary to turn the lights or on off or draw the curtains during Maghrib. Generally, lights are turned on during Maghrib and curtains are drawn.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
