  "question": "sometimes I swallow just after rinsing out my mouth but forgeting that I am fasting, does it nullify my fast?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have a problem with my throat where it's always becoming blocked and I have to keep swallowing the saliva in order to clear my voice (I can't spit it out becasue it's too deep). Unfortunately sometimes I swallow just after rinsing out my mouth but forgeting that I am fasting, does it nullify my fast? Also about the Hadtih that says \"Ibaadat not accepted for 40 days if one eats haraam\": What if one's family members bring food into the house which you eat and don't know contains haraam ingredients (and you really had no ground to suspect either) but the food does contain illegal ingredients. If a person sincerely promises never to eat that type of food again will his ibaadat be accepted again before the 40 days are up? What should someone do in a situation where they are meeting someone for the sake of the deen and they are invited into the house and offered food that they are not sure about but the host insists on them eating it and would be upset if the guests didn't do so?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If after rinsing your mouth, you spat the water out, then if you swallowed the wetness that remained in your mouth, your fast will not break. (Shaami Vol.2 Pg.435-Darul Fikr)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Ibadat not being accepted means that the responsibility will be fulfilled however the reward will be diminished or lost. Eating Haraam has an effect on the Ibadat and dua of a person, whether eaten deliberately or mistakenly. If mistakenly, one will not be a sinner, however the ill-effects of it will affect one, like poison taken mistakenly.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou should make sincere taubah and in the future make a concerted effort to eat only halaal, by checking yourself and educating members of your family in this regard.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. If your host offered you food that could contain poison, would you allow you shyness or the possibility of his being offended, to shop you from finding out if the food is indeed poisonous? Never, similarly if you suspect that the food could be from Haraam sources, then you should ask him in a manner that will not offend him.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
