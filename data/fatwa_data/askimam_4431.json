  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-u-alaikum In fast food restaurants such as Harvey's , McDonalds, Burger King, the fish fillet is fried in the same container as crispy chiken. Beef is however seperate. only fish and chicken are together and even the fries are seperated. Are we allowed to eat that fish? I asked an Alim here and he said it's allowed because chicken doesn't change the taste or shape of the fish whereas beef tallow does. But I didn't quiet understand his answer. Can you give a clearer answer for this? jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe chicken is Haraam and Najis (impure). Therefore, whatever comes into\ncontact with it also becomes impure (Najis). The oil in which the chicken\nwas fried has been contaminated and this will cause everything else that\ncomes into contact with it to become contaminated and Najis (impure) as\nwell.\n\nTherefore, it is not permissible for you to consume from such\nestablishments.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
