There is no danger of yielding to my desires as my nafs is well controlled. i feel i will be able to serve Allah (swt) better on my own. In such a condition is it possible for me not to get married?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for a male not to marry if he can contain his desires\nwithout committing any immoral act. However, Nikah is a great sunnah of our\nprophet (S.A.W). You stated that you are shy and fear not being able to\nfulfil your wife's rights. Being shy is not a valid excuse for not marrying\nas Rasulullah (SAW) was more shy than a most modest woman.
