  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWe have friends who work in a bank that is commercial banks so now the question is that should we tell them in a good manner that the money earned from it is haram or not coz people mind it when we tell them about it,they say we r not dealing in interest we just do job there............................plz guide us how should we react.          JazakAllah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nNahi Anil Munkar (stopping a wrong) is an express order of Allah Ta’ala. There are several warnings for not fulfilling the obligation of nahi anil munkar. The purpose of nahi anil munkar is to reform. In order to achieve the objective of reformation hikmat and wisdom is vital. Conventional Banks are interest bearing institutions. Interest is Haraam. To work in a conventional bank falls in the category of assisting in sin. If your friends work in a conventional bank, apply hikmah and wisdom and advise them. Emphasize on the importance of Halaal income. Highlight the prohibition and abhorrence of interest. A mu’min is driven by some degree of the consciousness of Allah. If you advise your friends with wisdom, they will reform, Insha Allah.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
