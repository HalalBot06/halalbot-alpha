  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nZakat:\n\n \n\n \n\nAssalam Alykum wa Rahmatullahu wa Barakatu,\n\n \n\n \n\n1)       I plan to go for  Hajj with my family this year InshaAllah. I have already paid the advance amount and will pay the remaining amount shortly. While calculating Zakat, may I deduct the remaining payable Hajj amount from my total wealth? Or should I calculate the Zakat without this deduction?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2)       I have the liability of Haq mehr (Divorce). The receiver of this amount refuses to take it. But my intention is to try all possible means to dispose off this amount. I have marked this amount separately for the last 2 years.  In previous years, I deduct this amount as a liability from my total wealth for calculating Zakat. Is this correct?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3)       In general, can the major upcoming costs in the remaining year be deducted from the total wealth to calculate Zakat?\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\n1)     The balance amount owing for Hajj is not a liability at the moment. Zakat should be paid on that amount.\n\n \n\n2)     If the person entitled to the amount refuses to take the money, it means the person has forfeited the amount in your favour. In this instance, the money belongs to you and you will have to include that amount in your Zakat.  \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
