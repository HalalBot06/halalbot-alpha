  "question": "I go to school, so I need Duas for tests. I heard that the 25th - 28th Ayaats are very good. Can you give me some other Duas?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n I have started wearing Hijaab alhamdulillah for the last 3 month and I feel very comfortable. The problem is that some old kaafir friends (I live in a Christian society) still have pictures with me without Hijaab, and I feel very uncomfortable. With most of them I do not have any contact anymore and the photos they have are from the time I was not Baaligh. I told one friend to give me all the photos of me back, so I can discard them. But what if there are still photos of me, but I do not know about them? Is ist Gunnah for me? What can I do?\n\nMy next question is: is NIVEA creme allowed? And what about Glycerin and Alcohol Denat? Is Alcohol Denat synthetic / artificial?\n\nI go to school, so I need Duas for tests. I heard that the 25th - 28th Ayaats are very good. Can you give me some other Duas?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is very encouraging to note your zeal and enthusiasm for Deen. May Allah keep you steadfast and make you the means of many women wearing the Hijaab. Ameen\n\nWe are responsible for those things which are within our control. You should request your old friends to discard or give you the old photos. You should explain to them that you are now in Hijaab and it is not appropriate for them to have the photographs.\n\nIt is permissible to use Nivea crème.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
