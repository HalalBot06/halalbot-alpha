  "question": "Is taazeem & meelad bidah? Can we celebrate the Prophets (peace be upon him) birthday by doing tazeem and standing?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMany people repeatedly ask what is the Shar%E9e status of%0D%0A\"%C9id-e-Meelad-un-Nabee'. Moreover, What is the ruling of the Shari%E1h with%0D%0Aregard to standing up in reverence and reciting Salaat and salaam during the%0D%0Acustomary Meelad proceedings?%0D%0A%0D%0AAnswer: The establishment of ceremonial gatherings under the banner of%0D%0A\"%C9id-un-Nabee\" is prohibited according to the Shari%E1h. Attaching importance%0D%0Aand significance to such functions is purely Bid%E1h and an innovation in%0D%0ADeen, because neither did Rasulullah himself indulge in it, nor did the%0D%0Aillustrious Khulafaa-e-Raashideen (Radhiyallaahu-%C1nhum) organise such%0D%0Afunctions. Similarly, neither did any of the other Sahaaba-e-Kiraam%0D%0A(Radhiyallaahu-%C1nhum) participate in such gatherings, nor is there any%0D%0Aincident on record during the blessed era of the taabi'een or tab'e%0D%0Ataabi'een (Rahmatullaahi %C1layhim) that can, in any way, substantiate this%0D%0Ainnovation. No proof whatsoever can be found, in spite of the fact that%0D%0Athese were people who were best acquainted with the Sunnah of Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) and had total love for him. They were staunch%0D%0Afollowers of the Shari%E1h.%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) has in no unclear terms, said: -%0D%0A\"whoever introduces anything that is not part of Deen, into this Deen of%0D%0Aours, it shall be rejected.\" (Bukhari%2FMuslim)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another Hadith he says: -%0D%0A\"Hold steadfast onto my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly-guided%0D%0AKhulafaa, after me. Hold steadfast onto it firmly, and beware of%0D%0Anewly-introduced practices, for every new practice is an innovation and%0D%0Aevery innovation leads one astray.\" (Abu Dawood%2FTirmizi)%0D%0A%0D%0ASevere warnings have been sounded in the above-mentioned Ahaadith with%0D%0Aregard to introducing and implementing innovations in Deen.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe holy Qur'an enjoins: -%0D%0A\"And whatsoever the messenger giveth you, take it. And whatsoever he%0D%0Aforbiddeth, abstain (from it). And keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is%0D%0Astern in reprisal.\" (59:7)%0D%0A%0D%0A\"Verily in the messenger of Allah, ye have a good example for him who%0D%0Alooketh unto Allah and the last day, and remembereth Allah much.\" (33:21)%0D%0A%0D%0A\"This day have I perfected your religion for you and completed my favour%0D%0Aunto you, and have chosen for you a religion, al-Islam.\" (5:3)%0D%0A%0D%0AThere are numerous other Aayaat and Ahaadith that can be quoted. But from no%0D%0AAayat or Ahaadith can the current form of \"Eid-e-Meelad-un-Nabee%0D%0A(Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)', be proved. In spite of this, the people%0D%0Athat revel in establishing and participating in such functions, and regard%0D%0Athe same as a form of reward, insist on forging ahead with their carnal%0D%0Aideals. This attitude of theirs causes some serious questions to be posed: -%0D%0A%0D%0ADid Allah Ta'ala not perfect Deen-e-Islam for this Ummah?%0D%0ADid Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) not disclose to us all the%0D%0Afacets and aspects of Islam that required being put into practice?%0D%0A%0D%0AThe bitter truth for the exponents of Bid'a is that it was only many%0D%0Acenturies after the righteous and golden era of Islam that people began t0%0D%0Afabricate innovations under the h00d of \"%C9id-e-Meelad-un-Nabee (Sallallaaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam)\" and \"Mahfeel-e-Meelad\", which were, practices not ordained%0D%0Aby Allah Ta%E3la to any of His Ambiyaa %C1layhimus salaam.%0D%0A%0D%0AWill such innovations grant proximity to Allah Ta%E3la? Never! On the%0D%0Acontrary, these innovations should be a cause of great concern and alarm for%0D%0Athe Ummat-e-Muslimah! Na-oothu-billahi-min-thalika! We seek Allah Ta%E3la's%0D%0Arefuge from innovations that tantamount to levelling mind-boggling%0D%0Aaccusations against the pure and venerable personality of Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) by innovating such practices, one is%0D%0Aindirectly suggesting that Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)%0D%0Aconcealed from the Ummah, aspects of Deen that were of immense benefit t0%0D%0Ait. How can this be possible when Allah Ta'ala himself categorically%0D%0Adeclares that he perfected this religion for us and completed his favour%0D%0Aupon us, which means that Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) conveyed%0D%0Aevery single aspect of Deen to the Ummah and that he left no stone unturned%0D%0Ain showing us every road leads t0 Jannah and every road that takes one to%0D%0AJahannam so that we may adopt the former and avoid the latter.%0D%0A%0D%0AHence, it is mentioned in one Hadith: -%0D%0A\"It was the incumbent duty of every Nabee %C1layhis-salaam to guide his Ummah%0D%0Atowards that which was beneficial for it and warn it against that which was%0D%0Adetrimental for it.\" (Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is a known fact that Rasulullah is the most superior of all the Ambiyaa%0D%0A%C1laihimus-salaam and also that he is the seal of all the prophets%0D%0A%C1layhimus-salaam. He left no stone unturned in conveying Deen to us and%0D%0Arendering precious advice to us. If the \"%C9id-e-Meelad-un-Nabee (Sallallaaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam)\" was a divinely inspired act, then surely Rasulullah would%0D%0Ahave commanded the Muslimeen to it, or at least, either he or his beloved%0D%0ASahaaba (Radhiyallahu-%C1nhum) would have practised it. When it cannot be%0D%0Asubstantiated by any of their actions, then it is a crystal clear fact%0D%0A\"%C9id-e-Meelad-un-Nabee (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)\" or \"Mahfeel-e-Meelad\"%0D%0A(call it what you may), has absolutely no relationship with Islam instead,%0D%0Ait is Bid%E1h (innovation) against which we have been soundly warned by%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) as was noted from the tw0 Ahaadith%0D%0Amentioned at the beginning of this discussion and, apart from them, many%0D%0Amore can be quoted to prove the fallacy of innovation in Islam. That is why,%0D%0Ain the light of these unambiguous proofs, the %DAlama-e-Haqq have always%0D%0Arefuted and rejected the customary form of%0D%0A\"%C9id-e-Meelad-un-Nabee%B7(Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)\" and Mahfeel-e-Meelad%0D%0Aand have also always discouraged people from participating in such%0D%0Agatherings.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf a careful and proper dissection of this \"%C9id-e-Meelad-un-Nabee%0D%0A(Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)\" is made, it will be found that, apart from%0D%0Ait being a manifestation of Bid'at, it also encompasses 0ther evils such as%0D%0Athe intermingling of sexes, usage of musical instruments and many other such%0D%0Aevils which wildly flaunted under the banner of \"%C9id-e-Meelad-un-Nabee%0D%0A(Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)\" and under the deception that reward is being%0D%0Aaccrued. The most abhorring and shocking evils in these functions are the%0D%0Aacts of shirk that take place. With hollow claims of \"Hubbe-Rasul%0D%0A(Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)\" (love for Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam)), entreaties and supplications are made to beings other than%0D%0AAllah, namely to Ambiyaa %C1laihimus-salaam and Auliaa-e-Kiraam%0D%0ARahmatullaahi-%C1laaihum. The exponents of \"%C9id-e-Meelad-un-Nabee%0D%0A(Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)\" also blindly acknowledge and believe that%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) comes to this function and due to%0D%0Athis belief, they stand up in respect and veneration to welcome him. This%0D%0Abelief is a blatant fabrication and a sign of compound ignorance. The true%0D%0Aand down t0 earth fact is that Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)%0D%0Adoes not arrive at any \"%C9id-e-Meelad-un Nabee (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam)\" function and that he is in his Rawdha-e-Mubarak (grave) at%0D%0AMadinah Munawwarah and will emerge from it at the onset of Yawmul-Qiyaamah.%0D%0AThe following Aayaat and Hadith testify to this fact: -%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Qur'an, addressing Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam), announces%0D%0Aexplicitly: -%0D%0A\"Lo! Thou wilt die, and Lo! They will die. Then Lo! On the day of%0D%0Aresurrecti0n, before your sustainer, you will dispute.\" (39:30,31)%0D%0A%0D%0AAt another juncture, Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) is addressed%0D%0Atogether with the rest of mankind: -%0D%0A\"Then Lo! After that ye surely die, then Lo! On the day of resurrection ye%0D%0Aare raised (again)\" (23:16)%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) himself has said in a Hadith: -%0D%0A%0D%0A\"My grave will be the first to be opened on the day of Qiyaamah and I shall%0D%0Abe the first person to intercede and the first person whose intercession%0D%0Ashall be accepted.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above mentioned Aayaat and Hadith as well as other similar Aayaat and%0D%0AAhaadith prove that all of mankind will be raised from their graves on the%0D%0Aday of Qiyaamah, with Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) being no%0D%0Aexcepti0n. This is a belief that revolves around the consensus of opinion of%0D%0Athe entire Ummat-e-Muslimah, hence the need for all Muslims to believe that%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) is in his Rawdha-e-Mubarak and%0D%0Adoes not frequent any \"%C9id-e-Meelad-un-Nabee (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)\"%0D%0Aprogramme. All Muslims must be made aware of this so that unsuspecting ones%0D%0Ado not fall prey to the Bid'at and innovations introduced into Deen by%0D%0Aignoramuses of this Ummah.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe make Du%E1a to Allah Ta'ala that he keeps us on the correct Deen-ul-Islam%0D%0Aand that he gives guidance to those that goes astray.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala's Durood and salaam descend upon Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Importance of Durood and Salaam%0D%0AInstead of squandering our money and time on futile acts 0f Bid%E1h let us%0D%0Arather utilise our precious time, as much as possible on the recitation of%0D%0ADurood and salaam upon our beloved Rasulullah, which is indeed, a highly%0D%0Ameritorious and virtuous act. The Qur'an enjoins: -%0D%0A\"Lo! Allah and his Malaaikah shower blessings on the Nabee 0 ye who believe%0D%0Aask for the descent of blessings on him and salute him with a worthy%0D%0Asalutation.\" (34:56)%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) has said: -%0D%0A\"Whosoever sends one Durood upon me, Allah Ta'ala will shower ten mercies%0D%0Aupon him.\" (Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0AParticularly on the day of Jumu%E1h one should increase the recitation of%0D%0ADurood and salaam.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta%E3la give us the guidance to recite Durood abundantly and grant%0D%0Aus 'Hubbe-Rasul (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)\" in the true sense of the%0D%0Aword.%0D%0A%0D%0AWarning to %DAlama%0D%0AHadhrat Mu%E1dh bin Jabal (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) narrates the following Hadith,%0D%0A'Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'whenever a Bid%E1h%0D%0Aoriginates in my Ummah and the %DAlama do not prevent it, the la%E1nat of Allah,%0D%0Aof his angels and of mankind descend upon them (the %DAlama who refrain from%0D%0Aprohibiting the innovation).'
