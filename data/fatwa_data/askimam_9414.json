  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)What should I read to protect myself from grave punishments? 2)What should I read for the dead when visiting graves? 3)I want to be Hafiz and learn Quran at home with supervision from my father. How many hours daily do you recommend me to spend memorising and what time of day will most be learnt? 4)Can any one become a saint if so how?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is stated in a Hadith that Surah Mulk safeguards from the trials of the grave. The Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to recite this Surah before going to bed. (Mishkaat, Page 188, Hisn-e-Haseen, Page 443) %0D%0A%0D%0A2. Buraidah (Radhiallaahu Anhu) says that the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) taught them the following Du?aa when they went out to visit the graves: ?Assalamualaikum ahlad diyaari minal mu?mineena wal muslimeen wa innaa insha-Allahu bikum laahiqoon. Nas alullaha lanaa wa lakumul ?aafiyata.? (Mishkaat, Page 154) %0D%0A%0D%0AThe recitation of Surah Ikhlaas eleven times, Surah Faatihah, Surah Takathur and Surah Yaseen has also been narrated in the Ahadeeth. (Bahishti Zewar, Page 991)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. At least four to five hours daily should be allotted for memorizing the Qur?an. The most appropriate times are after Fajr and Maghrib prayers. %0D%0A%0D%0A4. To become a saint is not some kind of post which can be attained through ones own intelligence and reputation. It is something that Allah Ta?ala endows some of his very close, pious and obedient slaves. Therefore one should always be aware of the commandments of Deen in order to gain proximity to Allah Ta?ala. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Ashraf%0D%0ADARUL IFTA ?
