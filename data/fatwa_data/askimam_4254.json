  "question": "Can a person in Salaat pull-out his handkerchief from his pocket and wipe/blow his running nose or watery eyes, and put it back? Or can they hold a tissue in their hand throughout their Salaat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWould either of these actions invalidate their Salaat?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf there is a need for a person to wipe his eyes or nose in salaah, it is\nadvisable he keeps a hankeychief or tissue in his hand during salaah.\nHowever, if he takes the hankeychief from his pocket and puts it back after\nusing it, that will not invalidate the salaah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
