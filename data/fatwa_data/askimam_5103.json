I don?t chat with strangers, but he forced me, well we were very good bro n sis..but last week, he said that he is in love with me and he wants to marry me...even though I never had ne kind of illicit feelings which cud encourage him for such decision.i explained him all the conditions about Islam n our family, but he is not ready to understand ! he said that he will wait for me forever!!I m very sad b?coz I don?t want to hurt neone.is it haraam to fall in love n find a spouse on internet?..plz help me soon!! i m 18 yrs old\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMarriage is a major decision in one's life. Do not make a rash decision. He\nmay claim he is in love but it could be just infatuation as is so often the\ncase with teenagers.\n\nIt is up to you to make a decision to marry. Nobody can force you. Don't\nbother about hurting his feelings as he has no rights whatsoever over you.\nIf you are genuinely interested, ask him to go through the acceptable\nchannels of proposals, etc. through your family. Also, avid further contact\nwith him since - as you acknowledge - it is a Haraam relationship.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
