  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\n1)     I want to know whether it is permissible to say\n\n “Oh messenger of Allah. be merciful.”\n\n “Bestow us with a look of favour” as mentioned in the qasida of maulana Jami\n\n2)hikayat 50 of fazil durood narrates the story of maulana jami.plz give the source of it.\n\n3)is prophet(saw) physically alive as people have received reply to their salutations at the blessed grave. Moreover I have heard about a pious person who was hungry in prophet(saw)’s mosque and he saw prophet(saw) in his dream giving bread to him, he ate it half. when he woke he saw half of the bread with him.\n\nwhat do such stories convey does prophet(saw) go anywhere physically.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1)      It is permissible to say \"Oh messenger of Allah be merciful\". The mercy which one asks from Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم is different from the mercy which one asks from Allah Ta'ala. It is also permissible to say \"bestow us with a look of favour\".\n\n2)      We could not allocate the reference of this story.\n\n3)      Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم is physically alive. However, His life is different to this worldly life in that He is not in need of food, drink etc. As for the incidents in your query, then these are all karamat's (miracles) which were granted to some chosen slaves of Allah Ta'ala. For further information of Nabi صلى الله عليه و سلم  being alive in His grave kindly refer to the following link:\n\nwww.central-mosque.com/fiqh/alive.htm\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
