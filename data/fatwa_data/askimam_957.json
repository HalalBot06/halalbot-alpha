  "question": "Is professional boxing for the sake of Islam allowed? Wasalam",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalam o laikum I am writing on behalf of an brother (born and brought up in UK) living here in the UK. This brother had a successfull amateur boxing career (fighting for England etc) and had many offers to become a professional boxer. He stopped boxing as he became a practising muslim and was told that it was Haram. If it is allowed then this brother would like to further his boxing career in the name of Islam by becoming world champion and donating all his money to islamic causes and raising awareness etc.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to Shari?ah, one may engage in sports activities to enhance good health or preparation for Jihaad.\n\nBoth the facts are not found in boxing. In fact, boxing is a danger to health and life. Many boxers have lost their lives in the ring due to head injuries. The icon of boxing, Muhammad Ali, who also has the honour of the only boxing professional to regain the heavyweight title three times is presently suffering from Parkinsons and many others sicknesses due to his career. It is not permissible to engage in any activity that will endanger one?s health. According to Shari?ah, boxing as a sport is not permissible. The income will be Makrooh.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
