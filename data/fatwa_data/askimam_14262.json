  "question": "Is it permissible to have a second jamaat in a musjid/musallae after the main/first jamaat",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. A prominent Mufti gave has given the verdict that to have a second jamaat for farz salaah in a musjid after the main/first jamaat is not permissible. He says that only for musafirs this is permissible.\n\nHe further states that if local musalles arrive late, then they should not make a second jamaat, but should read their salaah individually. The proof he gives is that a person should look in tirmidhi shareef. I am not a scholar of deen nor have acces to Tirmidhi. Could you give me your view regarding the matter and also tell me what is in Tirmidhi regarding this matter.\n\nMy question is that:\n\nIs it permissible to have a second jamaat in a musjid/musallae after the main/first jamaat\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nTo love your family and maintain family ties is an important injunction of Islam. The Qurâ€™aan and Hadith are replete with such rulings. If a non-Muslim relative passes away, and you are compelled to attend the burial, you will be excused.\n\nHowever, as a Muslim, try your level best not to join in any un-Islamic act during the proceedings. The reason for this is obvious. As a Muslim, one has to uphold the laws of Allah and cannot do anything against that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
