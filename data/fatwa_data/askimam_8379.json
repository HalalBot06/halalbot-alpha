  "answer": "QUESTION\nIts transliteration reads something like this: \"Rabana hablinah min azwajina wa duriya tina qurity a'u (or a'yu?)ni him waj allah li mutiquy (or mutaqi?) imamah\" I would like to know what the correct transliteration is ,its meaning , where I can find it and what it is for exactly. Jazakallah and please make dua for me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFirstly, the transliteration of ?Qurtiya?, is Qurrata.\n\nWith regards to the second, Mutaqi, is the correct way. The meaning of this verse is which comes in Chapter 19 (Surah Furqaan verse74).\n\n?O our Lord! Grant us the coolness of our eyes from our spouses and our children and make us leaders of the pious.?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
