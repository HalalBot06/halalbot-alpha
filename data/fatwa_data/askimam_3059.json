  "question": "Interpretation of two Dreams",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam Alaikum I had a dream in which i saw myself with a bunch of people in a flat at a high rise building. Looking out of the window, i saw a big dark monster, destroying the city. Quickly i turn my eyes away. Then i see the people I am with, looking at the monster, and turning evil, consequently. I rush towards them and demand them to look away. Saying \"Look away, look away. Dont u realise who this is? Its him, its him! Its Dajjal, Dajjal!\". And i turn towards the monster, and shaking my fists, i say \"La ilaha illalah, la ilaha illallah!\" The other dream I had was, that I see that the greatest signs of the Last Day are showing up, and some Messiah has arrived, which was part of the signs. And i find myslef weeping and indulging myself in ibadah. What could these mean?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBoth dreams indicate Qiyaamat being near.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
