  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) I have been praying my qazaa that I missed in my lifetime. Do I pray 4 farz or 2 farz for all the jumma farz I have missed? Should my niyah be:- salahtul jumma,2 farz praying qazaa? Or should I carry on as I normally do which is salahtul zohr, 4 farz praying qazaa? Please explain. 2) Is this correct for jumma= 4 sunnat, 2 Farz, 4sunnat, 2 sunnat? I am quite positive it is correct but please confirm. Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There is no Qadhaa for Jumu'ah Salaat. Rather, you should read 4 Rakaats\nof Dhuhr Salaat for all those Jumu'ahs that have been missed.\n2. Yes, this is correct.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
