  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf a woman is breastfeeding and she has not performed haj, does she have to wean the child off brestmilk? ie is it farz on her to do this?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to Shari?ah, it is the sole responsibility of the father to look after all the expenses of the child (breastfeeding included).\n\nIn this case, if Hajj becomes Fardh on a woman she will have to go. However, from a moral point of view and especially when there is nobody else to breastfeed the child, the mother can be forced and it will be her duty to breastfeed the child. (Hidaaya vol.1 pg.424)\n\nTherefore, in short it is imperative that the child is properly taken care off. If arrangements can be made to breastfeed and look after the child properly with which both the husband and wife are comfortably satisfied, then if Hajj is Fardh on you, you will have to go.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
