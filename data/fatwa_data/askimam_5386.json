  "question": "imam does not have a shariah beard and dresses in western style clothing so I travel 30 miles to another masjid ...",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThere is a mujahideen commander (Taliban) named Saif-ur-Rahman Mansour. Is it just wishful thinking that he is the man in the below hadith? The Prophet Muhammad (saw) said, \"A man named Harith bin Harith will come from Transoxania. His army will be led by a man named Mansour. He will pave and open the way for the government of the family of Muhammad (saw), just as Quraish established the government of the Messenger of Allah (saw). Every believer will be obliged to support him.\" (Abu Dawood) The Prophet (saw) said, \"We are the people of a household for whom Allah has chosen the hereafter rather than this world. The people of my Household will suffer a great deal after my death, and will be persecuted until a people carrying Black Flags will come out from Khurasaan. They will instruct and call the people to do good, but the people will refuse; then they will fight until they are victorious and they will hand the power over to a man from my Household. Then the earth will be filled with justice, just as it had been filled with injustice. If any of you live to see this you should go to him even if you have to crawl across the ice and snow. (Ibn Majah, al-Hakim , Imam Ahmed) If I may ask an unrelated question; there is a masjid near my home but the imam does not have a shariah beard and dresses in western style clothing so I travel 30 miles to another masjid where the imam follows shariah more closely in my opionin. Is it permitted for me to do this?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYes, it is permissible and recommendable. May you be rewarded for every step\nand moment spent in doing such an illustrious deed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
