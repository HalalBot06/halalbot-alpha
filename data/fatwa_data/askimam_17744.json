  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni was just wondering is it ok to read the quran online like an computer, ipods and such devices, i mean most of these stuff are usually used for alot of other things as well. i found this app for the ipod touch called iquran, wondering if its ok??? please do help. i personally think its not ok, but if there is any reasoning in proving it is ok that would be great.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\nAt the outset, it should be understood that the Qur’an is the divine scripture of Allah Ta’ala which has been revealed to the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) and has been preserved in its pristine form over the years and will remain like this till the last day. The Qur’an has a right upon us that we recite it, honour it and handle it with utmost respect.\nOver the years, as technology has progressed, many things, both beneficial and harmful have become widespread and easily available to all. Many people have used these opportunities to progress in good, whilst the majority have abused it.\n\nTo read Qur’an on the computer, iPod etc is permissible in itself. It is a common fact that whilst using these programs many etiquettes of the Qur’an are not upheld. Care should be taken that the due respect and etiquettes are shown to the Qur’an.\n\nWhen the verses of the Qur’an are displayed on the screen or the need arises to change the page, wudhu will be needed to touch the screen.\n\nكذا الوضوء فرض ( لمس المصحف ولو آية ) مكتوبة على درهم أو حائط لقوله تعالى \" لا يمسه إلا المطهرون \" وسواء الكتابة والبياض وقال بعض مشايخنا إنما يكره للمحدث مس الموضع المكتوب دون الحواشي لأنه لم يمس القرآن حقيقة والصحيح أن مسها كمس المكتوب\n(Hashiyatut Thahthawi pg 82, Ilmiyyah)\n\nIf you feel that you will not uphold and fulfil the due etiquettes of the Qur’an, it will be in the best interest of yourself not to download and use this application.\n\nWe make Dua to Allah Ta’ala that he instil the love for the Qur’an within us and give us the ability to fulfil the rights of the Qur’an upon us.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
