  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nif a person is eligible for zakat how much max. amt should we give to one person.\n\nex.one has $10,000 will it be ok if we give to single person.instead of dividing b/w 2or3\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe obligation of zakkat will be fulfilled even if you give all your zakaat money to one person.\n\nHowever, if zakkat will become fardh on the person who is taking zakaat due to the excess amount of money given to him, then that is mukrooh.
