  "question": "Is it permissible for a girl to do aerobics or to dance on a national songs ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn which no vulgar or sexual language or wording is being used only in front of Muslim females while her body is fully and properly covered . As I have read that our Prophet (P.B.U.H.) permits to sing and enjoy on special occasions like Eid etc. So please clarify that to me . Jazakallahu Khairun\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is certainly permissible, in fact, desirable to express happiness on\nhappy occasions like Eid, etc. However, the expressions must be within the\nlimits of Shari'ah.\n\nDancing is a salient custom of the Kuffaar to express happiness. Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Whosoever imitates a nation is among\nthem.' Furthermore, in the context of a female, in dancing, the form and\nshape of the body is revealed which is against the spirit of modesty and\nshame and Hijaab.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
