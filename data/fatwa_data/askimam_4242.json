  "question": "Is it ok for me to abandon everything in the world like education or anything and dedicate myself to Islam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)Can I use a breath mint spray(alcohol free) while fasting? 2) How old does a Muslims person have to be to get married? 3)Can person hug or kiss after the Nikah? 4) I am in love with a woman too much but sometimes i get angry because she had done Zina at age of 15...So help me in this because i wana be with her but i have this problem about ehr past too...Wasalam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYes, it is permissible - provided you have a source of income otherwise you\nmay become a burden on others.\n\n1. No, it is not permissible as the spray - though in aerosol form - turns\nto a miniscule amount of liquid and may enter the throat.\n2. There is no age restriction in Islam. Islam does not look at age but\nrather at the individual's urgency or need (could you be more specific with\nthis question?)\n3. Do you mean hugging and kissing the bridegroom after the Nikah ceremony\nin the Musjid? If so, this is not established in the Sunnah.\n4. It is due to your sense of possessiveness that you become angry with her\nover her past actions. This is obviously because you love her so much. If\nyou want her, accept her as she is - faults and all. Be considerate and kind\nto her. Nobody is perfect. Look at all her good instead of focusing on some\nevil of the past.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATW"
