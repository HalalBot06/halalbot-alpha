  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy  wife has exchanged old notes with the new notes where she pay slightly higher for the new notes. She will use the new notes to be given to children of relatives during the Eid day. I told her that this is riba transaction and ask her to give the new notes  to the children with the intention of charity without getting sawab. But after I read your fatwa, this one can only be done only to the poor relative. I don’t think my relatives are that poor to receive charity. So what we should do now for this big mistake. It’s impossible to take back the money from them as they might have used it. I really worried and scare about this since I thought that we’ve given our relative haraam money. Please answer this..I’m really waiting for your reply  .\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nExchanging old notes with new notes of a particular country must be in equal amount. Receiving any extra amount will be considered as Ribā.\n\nAccording to what you have mentioned in your query, the interest money was received by the Bank. Thus, the money which your wife distributed was not interest money. However, sincerely make tawbah and abstain from an interest based transaction in future.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl.
