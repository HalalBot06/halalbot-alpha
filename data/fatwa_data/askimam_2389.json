  "question": "Are crabs and lobsters Halal.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAnd May I have the proof for your answer.I was told that any creature which lives and dies in the sea is Halal food. But it is to my understanding that lobsters and crabs do not live and die in the sea, so are they halal. And also i was told that lobsters are Haram for the same reason dogs are haram, something to do with the way they use their paws or hands to hunt. Please could you clarify this issue. Thank You.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFrom seafood, only fish is made Halaal for us. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu\nAlayhi Wasallam) said, 'Two carions are made Halaal for us; Fish and locust.\n' (Mishkaat vol.2 pg.361). Fish is classified as a Vertebra. Crabs and\nlobsters are not vertebras but they belong to the Crustaece group, hence,\nnot permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
