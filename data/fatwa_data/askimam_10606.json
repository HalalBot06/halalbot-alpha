  "question": "Muhammed(SAW) prayed only 3 taraweeh prayer in the mosque. If that is so then from where did he pray taraweeh in the last 10 days when he was doing iitikaf. In the mosque or in the house?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIt is said that prophet Muhammed(SAW) prayed only 3 taraweeh prayer in the mosque as he did not want it to be made compulsory to his(SAW) companions and us. If that is so then from where did he pray taraweeh in the last 10 days when he was doing iitikaf. In the mosque or in the house? Then it was during the time of Umar(R) that he made taraweeh under one imam. But it is said that he did not participate in this prayer under 1 imam. Why did he not participate? Jazakallahumal Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] did not perform Taraweeh in congregation consecutively due to the fear that Taraweeh will become compulsory he continued to perform Taraweeh in his Mu?takaf (place of I?tikaaf).\n\nWe hope the above answers all your queries.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
