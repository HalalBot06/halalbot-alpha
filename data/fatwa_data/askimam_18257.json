  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nQ1) Is wearing tavees permissible. nowadays lots of people wear it for protection. did the nabi (saw) forbade this?\n\nQ2) Is swimming, horse riding, bows and arrows, wrestling and racing are sports that nabi (saw) use to do? can we say that they are considered to be sunnah?\n\njazakallah plz answer\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n1)      It is permissible to wear the Ta’weez (Talisman) on condition that it  is with the ‘words of Allāh’ (i.e. the names/attributes of Allāh as well as the words of the Holy Qurān) and Hadīth. (Mahmūdiya p69 vol.20)\n\nTa’weez and medication are the same, such that they only work by the will of Almighty Allāh. Therefore, it is imperative to have firm belief that only Allāh cures sicknesses, not medication, nor Ta’weez. \n\n \n\nThe father of Abu Khuzā ‘a said:\n\nسألت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فقلت يا رسول الله أرأيت رقى نسترقيها ودواء نتداوى به وتقاة نتقيها هل ترد من قدر الله شيئا قال هي من قدر الله\n\n“I asked “Oh messenger of Allāh! Do you think Ruqan (amulet), medication and security change something in Taqdeer (predestination)? Rasūlulah صلى الله عليه وسلم said “It is part of Taqdeer.”   (Tirmidhi)\n\n \n\n \n\n2) Racing, wrestling, horse riding, archery and swimming are all mentioned in the Aĥādīth and can be considered as Sunnah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
