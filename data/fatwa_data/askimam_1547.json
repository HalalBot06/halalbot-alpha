  "question": "Would the prizes I win, while participating in a video game competition and coming in the top ranks, be haram?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease comment. Jazak Allah Khair!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nVideo entertainment games have many unIslamic factors in them. Apart from the games having music and pictures which are prohibited, the nature of the games offered, for example, karate, shooting, killing, racing etc. have a potential of raising ones emotions and imbalance in a person, thus having far reaching negative consequences in many aspects of ones life. Consider the following from the Encyclopedia, 1993-1997 - Microsoft Corp. \"Critics of video games contend that children spend too much time and money on the games and that immersion in the fantasy of video games can have adverse effects on personality maturation. There have also been reports that the flashing graphics can trigger seizures in people who have certain types of epilepsy.\" In view of the unIslamic factors in video games, it is not permissible to play with them. It is also not permissible to open an entertainment centre with video games. The income generated from entertainment video machines will not be permissible. and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai FATWA DEPT."
