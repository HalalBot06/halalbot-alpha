  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know it is allow to ask our requirement to peer/wali/auliya who is in blessed grave, are they able to help us, if yes please dalil, if they are not able to help us why maulana qasim nanotvi saheb came two time from his grave and helped to deobandi people, one time maulana nanotvi saheb came to darul uloom deoband to help maulana rafiuddin saheb who has dispute with other ulemas of deoband and second time he was came in punjab (india) when deobandi alim was doing munazara (debating with barelvi alim) then maulana nanotiv saheb came with his body (not only rooh), kindly note that above two incidence is noted from Arwahe Salasha it is composed by well-known deobandi school, as barelvi accused on deobandi. Please clarify, this is not for insult of anyone, i am barelvi but I respect some of deobandi idea which is really  good  and according to sunnah and quran.  Please sir  don't take it  otherwise. Thanks\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is not permissible for one to make Dua to anyone besides Allah. If one makes Dua to anyone besides Allah this is Shirk. The Ulema of Deoband are of the same view.     \n\nوَيَكْفُرُ بِقَوْلِهِ أَرْوَاحُ الْمَشَايِخِ حَاضِرَةٌ ، تَعْلَمُ .(مجمع الانهر باب المرتد ج 1 – ص 691)\n\nوَلَا تَدْعُ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لَا يَنْفَعُكَ وَلَا يَضُرُّكَ فَإِنْ فَعَلْتَ فَإِنَّكَ إِذًا مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ (7Yunus V106-10)\n\n[Fataawa Mahmudiya V1 Pg 345 Faruqiya]\n\nKindly forward us the actual text in reference to Arwaahe Thalaatha for our review as we feel that the text has been misunderstood.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
