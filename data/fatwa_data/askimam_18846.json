  "question": "I wanted to know about sending salat and salam on the prophet",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI wanted to know about sending salat and salam on the prophet (Saas).\n\nOne salawat is \"sallallahu alayhi wa salam\" (Allah bless him and give him peace), another is \"Allah-hum-ma sal-li aa-laa say-yi-di-naa Muhammad wa aa-laa aa-le say-yi-di-naa-Muhammad wa baa-rik wa sal-lim\" (O Allah, send salutations upon our leader Muhammad and upon the family of our leader Muhammad).\n\n1) I am still confused. I don't know what to be thinking when I say durud sharif. I look up the words peace, salutations, and blessings, which are used in translations of darud sharif, in the dictionary but I am still confused as to what is meant with respect to prophet Muhammad (saas). Prophet Muhammad (saas) has passed away. Nothing in the dunya can harm him. He already is the best of creation and it is confirmed that he (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) will be getting the best abode in Jannah. When we send salawat on the prophet what are we praying/making dua for? Perhaps this misunderstanding is due to a mistranslation; maybe the Arabic words mean more than what they were translated into English as. InshaAllah please help remove this confusion that I have and give me a detailed explanation/commentary on the meaning of sending salat and salam on prophet Muhammad (s).\n\n2) Will you please explain the benefits/virtues of sending salah and salam on prophet Muhammad (S)? Are there any worldly benefits associated with it? Also how, how often, and when should we send salat and salam on Rasulullah (s)? If possible, will you please include relevant Quranic ayahs and ahadith/hadiths?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nFirstly, one should understand that our Dīn is based on submission. There are many wisdoms behind every single command of Allāh jalla jalāluhu . Some we know and many we do not know. Likewise, Allāh jalla jalāluhu himself sends salātus salām to his Nabi sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam. In this way we are following the way of Allāh jalla jalāluhu and His Honorable Angles. Further, Allāh jalla jalāluhu commands us to do the same. It is sufficient for us that our Creator is commanding us to send salutations on Nabi sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam .\n\n \n\n“Allah and His angels shower blessings on the Nabi (Prophet).  O You who believe! Ask blessings on him and salute him with a worthy salutation”\n” (33:56)[1]\n\n \n\nWe send durūd sharīf on Nabi sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam to acknowledge the great blessing that Allāh has given us by sending Nabi karīm sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam  to us. Just as prayer is a sign of our love, gratitude and obedience to Allāh jalla jalāluhu , sending durūd sharīf on Nabi sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam  shows our love for him, our respect for him, and our obedience to him and surely we will be rewarded for that.\n\n \n\nWhen a person gives a gift to a king, it does not mean that the king is in need of that gift. Similarly, when we send durūds to Nabi sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam it does not mean the he is in need of that durūd. In fact, that strengthens the connection between us and Nabi karīm sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam .\n\n \n\nWhen we send salātus salām to Nabi sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam this means that we ask Allah to send blessings on Nabi sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam and ask Allāh guide us to do so in the best manner. Whereas, when Allāh jalla jalāluhu sends salātus salām that means “Mercy from him”. Verily, Nabi karīm sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam is not in need of our praises but by praising Nabi sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam  and glorifying him we actually purify our soles and shows our love for Nabi sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam .\n\n \n\n Some Benefits and Virtues of Durūd Sharīf\n\n \n\nAmplification of reward, removal of sins and receiving the blessings of Allah.\n\n \n\nAnas Bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with them) reports: Nabi  ῾sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam said,: “Whomsoever sends one durood upon me then Allah jalla jalāluhu will send 10 durood upon him, forgive 10 of his sins, and elevate his rank 10 times.” [Nasā,ī][2]\n\nIntercession of Nabi sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam .\n\n \n\nAbu Dardaa (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam  said, “whoever sends blessings on me ten times in the morning and ten times in the evening will receive my intercession.” [Majmauz Zawāid][3]\n\n \n\nAnswering of one’s duaa.\n\n \n\nUmar radi Allahu anhu said, ““Duaa is suspended between heaven and earth and none of it is taken up until you send blessings upon your Prophet sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam .” [At-Tirmidhi][4]\n\n \n\n \n\nYou will be among the closest to the Prophet sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam  on the day of Resurrrection.\n\n \n\nIbn Mas’ood (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam  said: “The people who will be nearest to me on the Day of Resurrection will be those who supplicate Allah more often for me.” [At-Tirmidhi][5]\n\n \n\nImam Nawawi rahimahullah states, “Nearest to me” signifies “those who are most entitled to my intercession”.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWhen do we send Durūd Sharīf\n\n \n\nDuring  the tashahhud in prayer.\n\n \n\n \n\nAfter the Athan.\n\n \n\nAbdullah bin ‘Amr bin Al-’As (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam  saying, “When you hear the Athān, repeat what the Mu’adhdhin says. Then ask Allah to exalt my mention because everyone who does so will receive in return ten rewards from Allah. Then beseech Allah to grant me Al-Wasilah, which is a high rank in Jannah, fitting for only one of Allah’s slaves; and I hope that I will be that man. If any one asks Al-Wasilah for me, it becomes incumbent upon me to intercede for him.” [Muslim][6]\n\n \n\nWhen entering and leaving the Masjid.\n\n \n\nEspecially on  Fridays.\n\n \n\nAus bin Aus (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam  said, “Among the best of your days is Friday; so supplicate Allah more often for me in it , for your supplications will be displayed to me.” He was asked: “O Messenger of Allah! How will our blessings be displayed to you when your decayed body will have mixed with the earth?” He sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam , “Allah has prohibited the earth from consuming the bodies of the Prophets.” [Abu Dawood][7]\n\n \n\nDaily Adhkar (remembrances) of the morning and evening.\n\n \n\nAbu Dardaa (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam  said, “whoever sends blessings on me ten times in the morning and ten times in the evening will receive my intercession.” [Majmauz Zawāid][8]\n\n \n\nWhen his  name is mentioned in a gathering/written form etc.\n\n \n\nThe Prophet sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam  said, “The miser is the one in whose presence I am mentioned but he does not supplicate for me.
