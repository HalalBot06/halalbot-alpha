  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nALLAH'S MERCY AT THE TIME OF TAHAJJUD%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah [salallahu alaihi wasallam] said, \"At night there is such a moment in which a Muslim supplicates Allah Ta'ala for the good of this world or the Hereafter, Allah Ta'ala will grant him his request, and this moment appears every night.\" [Muslim]%0D%0A%0D%0ANote: This Hadith bears the good fortune of acceptance of ones Duas at night. However, mention is not made of the specific moment of acceptance. Some Ulama are of the opinion that this period is not known like that of Lailatul Qadr and the special moment of acceptance on Jumua, while others opine that it is at midnight. [Mazahir]%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another Hadith, Rasulullah [salallahu alaihi wasallam] said, \"The closest Allah Ta'ala gets to his servant is in the last portion of the night. If you possess the ability to be from among those who remember Allah, then become one of them.\" [Tirmidhi]%0D%0A%0D%0ANote: \"The closeness of Allah\" refers to Allah's pleasure and mercy showered upon his servants who sacrifice their sleep and strive in His worship. [Mazahir]%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah [salallahu alaihi wasallam] said, \"When one third of the night remains our Rabb [Lord], Most High, Most Exalted, descends to the first sky and announces, \"Who is there to beseech Me that I may answer his prayer and who is there to seek forgiveness that I may forgive him.' Then He spreads out His hands [of kindness and mercy] and proclaims, \"Who will grant a loan to the One who is neither a destitute or an oppressor.? [Muslim]%0D%0A%0D%0ANote: 1. Allah Ta'ala is free from bodily form and shape. He is Omnipresent and He is not confined to space. Hafiz Ibne Hajar and Imaam Malik [rahmatullah alaihimal have stated that \"Allah Ta'ala descending to the first sky\" signifies His special Mercy through which He accepts Duas and forgives sins. [Lam'aat]%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The loan mentioned in the Hadith refers to bodily and financial devotions offered to Allah Ta'ala with the hope of attaining rewards.[Mazahir]%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE CORRECT TIME FOR TAHAJJUD%0D%0A%0D%0AThe time of Tahajjud extends from the time of Isha until SUBHE SADIQ [true dawn]. Ahadith related from Hadhrat Aa'isha [radhiyallahu anha] state that Nabie [salallahu alaihi wasallam] sometimes performed Tahajjud in the early portion of the night and on occasions when half the night had passed. However, towards the latter part of his life he frequently performed it in the last portion of the night. As the night progresses, Allah Ta'ala's Mercy and Blessings increase. Hence, the last sixth of the night is most preferred. [Maktoobat Shaikh ul Islaam 77 p 202 - Fatawa Rahimiya vol 2 p 376]%0D%0A%0D%0ADUA TO ASSIST ONE IN AWAKENING FOR TAHAJJUD%0D%0A%0D%0AA person remarked to Abdullah bin Abbas [radhiyallahu anhu], \"I always intend awakening in the last portion of the night to perform Salaat but sleep overpowers me.\" Ibne Abbas [radhiyallahu anhu] replied, \"Before sleeping recite from \"QUL LAW KAANAL BAHRU MIDADAL...\" to the end of Surah Kahf. Allah Ta'ala will waken you at whatever time you intend rising.\" [Tha'labi-Ma'ariful Quraan vol 5]%0D%0A%0D%0ANUMBER OF RAKAATS IN TAHAJJUD%0D%0A%0D%0AThe number of rakaats performed by Nabie [salailahu alaihi wasallam] varied according to the prevailing circumstances. Although on certain occasions sufficient time was available, Nabie [salailahu alaihi wasallam] would perform less rakaats reciting lengthy Qiraat.[Khasa'ile Nabawee p 156]%0D%0A%0D%0ADeducing from the various narrations four to twelve rakaats in units of two or four have been recommended. [Imdaadul Fatawa vol 1 -Baab finnawaafil %2F Maraqiyul Falah], However if two rakaats are performed in the prescribed time it will be regarded as Tahajjud.[Raddul Mukhtaar vol 1 p 715]%0D%0A%0D%0AOCCASIONS WHEN ONE IS UNABLE TO AWAKEN FOR TAHAJJUD%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Aa'isha [radhiyallahu anhal relates, \"If for some reason Rasulullah [salallahu alaihi wasallam] was unable to perform Tahajjud, he would perform twelve rakaats during the day [at the time of Chaast - before midday\". [Shamail Baab fi Ibadah]%0D%0A%0D%0ANote: Hadhrat Umar [radhiyallahu anhu] relates that Rasulullah [salallahu alaihi wasallam] said, \"Whoever was unable to complete his devotions at night should complete it in the morning before noon. It will be regarded as though he had completed it at night.\" [Muslim]. One should not overlook it because of the time passing by, otherwise the nafs will become accustomed to omitting it.
