  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni have asked several molvie about my divorce some said that im divorced and some said im not so i did istikhara keeping in mind that we r still in nikha and i saw a light first day than i did it again and i saw green chiles so i want to know if it is permissionable to do this. and what is the meaning of this thank you. sorry if u received this question many times its just im trying to send this but the question is keep appering so sorry about that\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIstikhara is performed to guide one in permissible options. Istikhara is not to determine Halal and Haram.\n\nHalal and Haram issues should be referred to a competent Aalim or a Mufti in whome one is confident on and he is known for his uncompromising attitude in issuing clear cut Sharii rulings. After receiving a ruling, abide by the ruling. If there are differences among the Ulama and Muftis, practice upon the Ihtiyaat (precaution).\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
