  "answer": "QUESTION\ni just had a couple of questions one about, is it true that all the prophets are desendents from each other. Adam>Idris>Noah>Hud>Salih>Ibrahim>Ismael..>Mohamed pbuh all of them? how many prophets were they in total? somone told me it was 124,000. allah A3lam\n\nand the second question, where is/were the tribes of Thamud located?\ni was curious as i was reading their story, and ended up in this line:\n\"Ibn Umar narrated that while the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was passing by Thamud's houses on his way to the battle of Tabuk, he stopped together with the people there. the people fetched water from the wells from which the people of Thamud used to drink. They prepared their dough (for baking) and filled their water skins from it (the water from the wells). The Prophet of Allah (PBUH) ordered them to empty the water skins and give the prepared dough to the camels. Then he went away with them until they stopped at the well from which the she camel (of Salih) used to drink. He warned them against entering upon the people that had been punished, saying \"I fear that you may be affected by what afflicted them; so do no enter upon them.\"\"\n\ndo these places still exist?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Only some prophets are the descendants of other prophets, not all of them. Abu Dharr [radhiallaahu anhu] asked Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], ‘How many prophets were they?’ Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] replied, ‘124000’. (ibn Hibbaan; Fathul Baari vol.6 pg.278)\n\n2. The tribes of Thamood were located between North Hijaaz and Jordan. Today, the two towns could be found in that area – Madaain Saalih and al-Oola. Some remnants of the Thamood still remain upto today. (Atlas al-Hadith al-Nabawiy pg.103; Dar al-Fikr)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
