  "question": "Is this hadith talking about the twelve imams which Shiaâ€™s talk about. Am I correct? If not, why not?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nNarrated Jabir ibn Samurah: The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: The religion will continue to be established till there are twelve caliphs over you, and the whole community will agree on each of them. I then heard from the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) some remarks which I could not understand. I asked my father: What is he saying: He said: all of them will belong to Quraysh.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly substantiate on the Hadith referring to the twelve Imaams as understood by the Shi'as. In principle, substantiation is upon a claim, not\nupon disclaiming.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
