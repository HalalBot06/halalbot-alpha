  "question": "According to your fatwa's at various sections masturbation and zina are both major sins. Does this mean there is no difference between them for a single man?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBoth are major sins, however, of a different level.\n\nThere is no worldly punishment prescribed in the world for masturbation. The punishment for Zina is 100 lashes if the person is not married or stoned to death if he is married. It is clear that the crime of Zina is more severe than masturbation. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) says, ?Allah curses the person who commits masturbation.?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
