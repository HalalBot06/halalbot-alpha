  "question": "Is it permissible to 'assalama alayka ya rasoolallah'",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn my masjid it is said after azaan and also by the imaam in the Friday Khutba.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAbdur-Rahmaan ibn Abi Laylha (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Ka'ba ibn%0D%0AUjra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) met me in the Musjid. He said to me, 'Should I not%0D%0Agift to you something that I had heard from Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam)?' I replied, 'Most certainly please do so.' He said, 'We asked%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), 'O Rasul of Allah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam), How should we sent salaat (blessings) upon you (and) the%0D%0AAhlul-Bayt (members of your household). For Allah Ta'ala has shown us only%0D%0Ahow to send salaams (salutations) upon you (but not Salaat)?' Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) replied, 'Say, O Allah send Salaat (blessings)%0D%0Aupon Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) like how you sent them upon%0D%0AIbraahim (Alayhis salaam). Verily thou art most worthy of praise, most%0D%0Ahonourable (the formula of Durood-e-Ibraahim).' (Bukhari and Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn this Hadith (tradition), Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) taught his%0D%0ASahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhu) the way of sending Salaat and Salaam (blessings%0D%0Aand salutations) upon him. Also we see no similarity between the way taught%0D%0Aby Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the baseless custom prevailing%0D%0Anowadays. Undoubtedly, Salaat is a powerful blessing and a means of great%0D%0Arewards, provided it is carried out in the way shown by our beloved Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Neither has Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) nor the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhu), Taabi'een (RA) and pious%0D%0Apredecessors specified any time or mode for reciting of Durood and Salaam as%0D%0Ais the practise nowadays. Neither did any of the Sahaab nor Taabi'een carry%0D%0Aout the practise that is now prevalent, rather they strongly opposed such%0D%0Ainnovations. To specify certain times, e.g. after Fardh (obligatory) prayers%0D%0Aor after Jummu'ah, likewise, after Adhaan and to recite in a loud voice or%0D%0Ain group form, etc. and regard these practises as necessary and part of Deen%0D%0Ais undoubtedly an innovation.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is narrated that Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiallaahu Anhu) once heard of a group%0D%0Athat had gathered in a Musjid reciting the Kalimah and Durood and Salaam in%0D%0Aa loud voice. He immediately confronted them and said, 'This is a practice%0D%0Awe have not seen in the time of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). I see%0D%0Ayou all to be only Bidaaits (innovators).' He continued to say this until he%0D%0Ahad chased them all out of the Musjid. (Bazzaariyyah and Shaami). Most%0D%0Adefinitely, we should make it a practise torecite Durood and Salaam on Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) as much as possible, but we should be careful%0D%0Ato do this only in the way shown by Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Ahimself.
