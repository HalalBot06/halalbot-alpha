  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it ok for me to be a muslim...when i a christian person... as i love a muslim ... and he wants to marry me.. but i am married  and separated..with two kids... is this correct for him... thanks\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nOne of the best decisions in life would be for you to embrace this beautiful religion of Islam. Of the many great blessings of accepting Islam is that all one's previous sins will be erased. The Last Prophet of God - Prophet Muhammed Salallahu̒alaihi Wa sallam- said:\n\nالإسلام يهدم ما كان قبله\n\n\"Islam wipes out (sin) that occurred before it.\"\n\n \n\nIt is not clear to us whether you are divorced or not, if you not divorced then there are certain things that you should bear in mind before making this decision. i.e.\n\n1) Once you embrace Islam,  Islam should then be presented to your present husband. If he becomes a Muslim, your marriage to him will remain intact. If he refuses to accept Islam, your marriage to him will terminate.\n\n2) If you do decide to embrace Islam as a faith, it should be that you believe it to be truth with your heart and soul. It should not be that you merely accept the Islamic faith to marry this Muslim man.\n\n3) If your husband does not accept Islam, and this Muslim intends to marry you. A period of three menstrual cycles should first pass before getting married to him.\n\n \n\nNB.   If your husband accepts Islam whilst being married to you and your separation still leads to a divorce, then too, three menstrual cycles should pass before remarrying. (This is according to Islamic law)\n\n \n\nPS.   It is also your duty as a mother to bring your children to accept Islam. If they have already attained puberty, they should not be forced to accept Islam, rather it should be presented to them and encouraged upon them.\n\n \n\nMay Almighty God guide you to the truth and make your decision easy. Ameen\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n\n\nMl. Zakariyya bin Ahmed,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftāa"
