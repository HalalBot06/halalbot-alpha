  "question": "Is combining the fast of Nabi Daud (AS) with the Mondays-Thursdays Sunnah fast permissible in Islam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like to fast both the Sunnah fast of Mondays-Thursdays and also the Sunnah fast of Nabi Daud (AS). But I would like to know if this is permissible, since combining the two would cause certain periods of consecutive fasting during the week. If this is not permissible, then what is the solution? Is there a way to reconcile the two fasts? If I have to choose one of the two, then which fast is recommended? Jazakum Allah khueyr.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNafl (voluntary) fasts are permissible every day of the year besides the 5\ndays, i.e. the day of Eid-ul-Fitr, Eid-ul-Adhaa and 3 days thereafter.\n\nDawood (Alayhis salaam) used to fast every alternate day. Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'the Most virtuous fast is the fast of\nDawood (Alayhis salaam).' It is permissible to keep as many Nafl fasts as\npossible on condition it does not affects one's health.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
