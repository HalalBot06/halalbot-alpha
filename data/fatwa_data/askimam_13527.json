  "question": "I live with my wife in another apartment. If my parents insist on living with me in my apartment and my wife does not agree, should I listen to my parents or my wife ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy parents ( age between 60-65) live somewhere else in an apartment and I pay expenses for their rent. I live with my wife in another apartment. If my parents insist on living with me in my apartment and my wife does not agree, should I listen to my parents or my wife ? My parents are somewhat abusive and  my wife  is afraid she will get abuse if they live together. My parents also say that my prayers will not be accepted by allah if I do not listen to them. I believe that my wife is entitled to a separate apartment under sharia laws because I can afford it. Please advise .\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to Shariah, your wife will pay Zakaat on the jewellery if one entire lunar year has passed while the jewellery was in her possession. Therefore, from the day you had given her the jewellery you will calculate one lunar year and offer the Zakaat thereafter.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai\nStudent: Darul Ifta\n\nChecked and Approved: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
