  "question": "My parents wear black dye on their hair, not to look young though.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n(1) They look old and have no intention of looking young,why at this age of 54 and 60 would they want to look young, I love them because they are my parents,why is it that they will not even smell fragrance of paradise because they dye their hair black. This is not fair. (2)I would like to know what colour they should use on their hair,an alternative is dark brown but I'm not sure of they will listen to me, they have said that brown will make them look like as if they want to look young and attractive while black is black.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n(1) Your love for your parents should in fact motivate you to discourage them from doing anything unlawful in Islam as that will be detrimental for them in the hereafter. You may advise them to use another colour dye.\n\n(2) Any colour hair dye besides black is permissible. It does not matter if your parents look attractive or young.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
