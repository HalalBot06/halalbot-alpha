  "answer": "QUESTION\nI wanted to clarify about the existence of \"KHABEES\" jinn like creatures who according to the Ulama stay in dirty and filthy conditions. It seems they're even mentioned in the Qura'aan.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nAlmighty Allah Ta’āla says,\n\nوَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنْسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ\n\nAnd I have not created Jinn and human beings except that they worship me.(Qur’ān 51:56)\n\nIt is clear from this verse that Jinns are also a creation of Allah Ta῾āla and also obliged to follow the laws of Shaī῾ah like human beings.\n\nJinns are created from fire. There are obedient jinns as well as disobedient jinns. The term Khabīs means dirty and filthy. Generally the term khabīs refers to Shaytān.\n\nRasulullah salallahu ῾alayhi wasallam advised when one enters the toilet, he should recite\n\nاللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنَ الخُبُثِ وَالخَبَائِثِ\n\nOh Allah, I seek refuge in you from the male and female Khabīs (Jinnāt)\n\n(Sahīh al Bukhāri #142, 1/41, Dārut tawqun Najāt)\n\nWhen a person recites this du῾ā’ Allah Ta’āla creates a veil between him and the Khabīs.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
