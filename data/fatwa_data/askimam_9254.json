  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was wondering if cats were allowed to be kepy at pets. I heard a story when i was little that the prophet (peace be upon him) had a cat, is this true? I was told that the cat fur carries diseases and it was gunah to allow cats inside the house. If you could answer my questions it would be greatly appreciated. Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAbu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) was a Sahaabi of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). The name ?Abu Hurayra? means ?Father of a kitten?. This title was given to him by Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) himself as he was fond of his kitten pet.\n\nIt was a common feature to have cats in the house of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum). It is permissible to have cats as pets and for them to be in the house. It is obvious one has to take care of any pet and also ensure that they do not carry any disease in them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
