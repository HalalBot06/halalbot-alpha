  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan you please let me know how to pronounce ASHAZ in urdu. and let me know in which book i can find Hadith on a sahabi By this Name.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nWe did not come across in our research any Sahabi by the name ‘Ashaz’. \n\nThere is a Sahabi by the name ‘Ashaj’.  It will be written as اشج in Arabic and Urdu and pronounced Ashaj.  The six books of hadith (Sihah al-Sitta) mention about a delegation from that came to visit Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam).  The leader of the delegation was Ashaj ‘Abd al-Qays.  Imam Abu Dawood narrates in his Sunan the incident in the following words: \n\nعن زارع وكان فى وفد عبد القيس قال لما قدمنا المدينة فجعلنا نتبادر من رواحلنا فنقبل يد النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم ورجله قال وانتظر المنذر الأشج حتى أتى عيبته فلبس ثوبيه ثم أتى النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال له  إن فيك خلتين يحبهما الله الحلم والأناة قال يا رسول الله أنا أتخلق بهما أم الله جبلنى عليهما قال بل الله جبلك عليهما قال الحمد لله الذى جبلنى على خلتين يحبهما الله ورسوله (ابو داود)\n\nIt is narrated from Zaari’, who was one from the delegation of ‘Abd al-Qays, “When we reached Madinah, we quickly dismounted from our caravans and kissed the hands and feet of Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam).  Mundhir al-Ashaj waited until he reached his luggage and donned new clothes then proceeded to visit Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam).  Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) said to him, “Verily you have two good qualities in you which Allah loves; forbearance and patience.”  He asked, “O Rasulullah, did I instilled this qualities within myself or was it Allah who dispose them in me?” Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) replied, “Allah has naturally disposed these qualities in you.”  He said, “All praise is to Allah who disposed in me two qualities which Allah and his Rasul love.” Abu Dawood\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
