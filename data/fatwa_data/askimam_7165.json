  "answer": "QUESTION\ni was asked by a kuffar and due to my lack of knowledge i could'nt answer properly so please help!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, it is our belief and aqeedah that there is life after death this is supported by many verses and ahadith. Therefore who rejects life after death is considered out of the fold of Islam.\n\nHereunder are references of quranic verses to support this belief: 1) Surah 56 verses 47-50, 2) Surah17 verses 97-99\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
