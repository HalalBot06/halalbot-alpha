  "question": "Interpretation of my two dreams.Some man reading at-tahiyyatu li-lahi was-salalwatu & in another reading Allah's name 'ya-rashidu' in my dream",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n(1) I saw this movie a year ago in which an indian actor reads 'at-tahiyyatu li-lahi was-salalwatu.....till the end. And just a few days again i had this dream in which there was this man (the same indian actor) who was reading \"at-tahiyyatu li-lahi was-salalwatu wat-tayibatu As-salawatu alayka ay-yuhan-nabiyyu wa rahmatul-lahi wa barakatuhu as-salamu alayna wa ala ibadil-lahi s-salihinaq Ash-hadu al-la ilaha illal-lahu wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan abduhu wa rauluhu' in my ear. He read the Muhammadan abduhu wa rauluhu part out very loud. What could this mean? (2) In my dream i remember i was reading Allah's attributes (names). I clearly remember reciting 'ya-rashidu' though. Later on I was trying to count on my fingers some names and at one point i was thinking about Fatimah (the daughter of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)). I mean to say is that i was saying her name & remembering her in particular.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. To see movies is Haraam. You should make Tawbah (repent) for seeing movies and make a firm intention never to see movies in the future. The dream is a reflection of the movie in your mind.\n\n2. Recite ?Yaa Rashidu? abundantly. You should also inculcate the habit of making Tasbeeh-e-Faatima. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised her to recite 33 times Subhaanallah, 33 times Alhamdulillah and 34 times Allaahu Akbar after every Fardh Salaat. The three points of the fingers may be used to calculate the Tasbeeh.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
