  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy sister in law has married a kufr. My mother in law initially scolded her daughter for marrying an american man but said nothing about the fact that he is not a muslim. All she worries is about what other people will say when they see he is american. She has not taught her children about islam at all so they do not how to be paak, have ghusl, pray salah anything. Christmas is celebrated more then Eid. My mother in law just laughs. My mother in law used to constantly pick my faults for years and made up a few false stories and talked about me behind my back. She only stopped when she realised that I was helping her son become more of a muslim. I have always tried so hard to help them whenever they are in hardship. I even stopped my sister in law from running away with this guy (although my mother in law does not know this). No matter what I do it is never enough. However, her non muslim son-in-law is wonderful because he is her daughters husband. What should I do? I know Allah only guides those he chooses and so there is nothing I can do for them. But I feel really unhappy that this is my family. I don't want them near my children but I cannot break ties with them as my husband has forbidden this. What duas can i pray for a) my children to become good muslims. b) to Allah to give me strength so that I do not get bitter with this situation and accept it. It makes me so angry and I want to cry all the time.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe world is certainly in a sad pitiful state. %0D%0A%0D%0AWe understand the unhappy feeling you are experiencing. Masha Allah that you have helped your families. Now re-focus: Look at your purpose in life, work towards building your taqwa and your deen and your life. Focus on your children, your goal for everything not how much you do rather focussing on will 'My Allah' be happy. Work on staying away from sins. Smile, be happy when people see your example, contentment, happiness they will want to follow you. However be careful don't preach or find fault or lecture and neither get caught in pride or changing and proud at your success. %0D%0A%0D%0ARemember then whatever you do you will only focus on the pleasure of Allah Ta'ala and not your good work. Your reward is with Allah Ta'ala, a better reward and remember test and trials in the part of deen must be expected. Consider the tests of our Beloved Prophet Salallahu Alayhi Wasalam and the Sahaba-e-Kiraam. Also never despair in the Mercy of Allah. After difficulty comes ease.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A1SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
