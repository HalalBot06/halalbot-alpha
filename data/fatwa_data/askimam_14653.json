She alway's cries and it makes me and my younger sister upset. (he is seperated from my family and married to someone else)\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\n1. Parents will be sinful if the child will commit sins due to not performing Nikah.\n\n \n\nThe status of Nikah is Shariah:\n\nThe ruling of performing Nikah will differ with individual persons.\n\n \n\nThe performance of Nikah will be Fardh when:\n\nThe desire and the passion overpowers a person\n\nThere is certainty of committing zina\n\nOne is in a position of giving mehr (dowry) and maintaining his wife\n\nThere is no fear of treatment and oppression of one’s wife\n\n \n\nThe performance of Nikah will be Wajib when:\n\nDesire and passion is overpowering a person\n\nThere is fear of committing zina\n\nOne is in a position of giving mehr (dowry) and maintaining his wife\n\nThere is no fear of treatment and oppression of one’s wife\n\n \n\nThe performance of Nikah will be Sunnat mukkidah when:\n\nThe person of moderate nature\n\nThere is no real fear of committing zina\n\nOne is in a position of giving mehr (dowry) and maintaining his wife\n\nThere is no fear of treatment and oppression of one’s wife\n\n \n\nThe performance of Nikah will be mustahab when:\n\nOne has no wealth to give as mehr and maintaining his wife. He should take an interest free loan and repay the loan\n\n \n\nThe performance of Nikah will be Makhrooh tahrimi when there is fear of oppression.\n\n \n\nThe performance of Nikah will be haraam when there is conviction of committing oppression. If the desire and passion is overpowering and there is a fear of committing zina and also a fear of oppression then making Nikah will be haraam or Makhrooh tahrimi\n\n \n\n2. Masalah: if a person vomited unintentionally  then the fast wil not break irrespective of how the amount however, if he/she vomited intentionally, his fast will break if the vomit was full-mouth; if it is less than a mouthful, the fast will not break.\n\n \n\nMasalah: if a small amount of vomit came out but it returned down the throat on its own, then the fast will not break. However, if the person swallows it intentionally, his fast will break.\n\n \n\n \n\n3. Recite salawat (daruud) upon Nabi salallahu alaihi wasalam abundantly and there after make dua\n\n \n\n4. After Ramadhan Radio Ramadhan Croydon will be closed\n\n \n\n5. Yes the ibadaat prohibited for a hida woman is reciting of touching the Quran, entering the Masjid, praying Salah, and keeping fast, tawaaf of baitullah.\n\n \n\n6. Narrate virtues of patience to her and you should also make your own Dua for her\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nThe ask imam site will not process questions from October 23 till October 27. You may forward your observations about the site.\n\n \n\nContact the Imam of Croydon Masjid and Islamic Centre for all the talks of Mufti Ebrahim Desai conducted through radio Ramadhan Croydon and Croydon Masjid and Islamic Centre 525 London road, Thornton Heath Croydon, Surry, CR7 6AR\n\n \n\n \n\nHappy Eid Mubarak to you\n\n \n\nMay Allah accept your ibadat in Ramadhan and grant us all His pleasure and Jannah (Aameen)"
