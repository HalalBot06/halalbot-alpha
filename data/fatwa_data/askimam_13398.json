  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease interpret the following dream:\n\nI came back to my house after maybe a few months, when I opened the door I said \"assalamualeikum\" to follow the sunnah, and a strong male voice answered, which I saw and identified as a jinn. I wanted to answer back, but my throat was blocked, and I was very scared.\n\nDuring the same dream, I was very high in the sky then I started flying down to earth at very high speed (like descending from the heavens).\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The first dream is an indication of peace and salaamat upon you.\n\n2. The second dream is a reality. When one sleeps, his soul goes up to Allah and returns to earth upon awakening.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
