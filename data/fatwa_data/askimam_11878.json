  "question": "I know a pious muslim who opens a faal.She says that it is for guidance & we must have strong belief in Allah for it to work.Is this practice allowed?It is not fortune telling",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA faal is a good omen. If it does not contain anything of Shirk or any thing Shaitani , then it would be permissible as long as the person believe that it is Allah who does, not this faal.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
