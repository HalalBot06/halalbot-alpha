  "question": "Allah loves his slaves 70 times more than a mother loves her children",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am puzzled, I have heard somewhere that Allah Almighty loves his creations 70 times more than a mother, so why is He not giving hidaya to so many non-believers and some believers who don’t follow Islam like shias; why would he want 5.5 billion people alive go to jahannam as Islam says you cannot go to jannah unless you follow Islam and that further if you don’t believe in Nabi and all of his Sahaba as the shia don’t follow some Sahaba (Ra)?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\nFirst, it should be known that Allah’s love for His creation is not general and unrestricted. This can be known from the following explicit verses of the Holy Quran,\n\n \n\nيَمْحَقُ اللّهُ الْرِّبَا وَيُرْبِي الصَّدَقَاتِ وَاللّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ كُلَّ كَفَّارٍ أَثِيمٍ\n\nAllah effaces (the blessings) of usury and increases (the blessings) of charity; and Allah does not love the ungrateful sinners. (2:227)\n\n \n\nوَقَاتِلُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ الَّذِينَ يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ وَلاَ تَعْتَدُواْ إِنَّ اللّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْمُعْتَدِينَ\n\nAnd fight in the path of Allah those who fight you, and do not exceed the limit; verily Allah does not love the transgressors. (2:190)\n\n \n\nقُلْ أَطِيعُواْ اللّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ فإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّ اللّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْكَافِرِينَ\n\nSay, obey Allah and the Messenger; and if they turn away, verily Allah does not love the disbelievers. (3:32)\n\n \n\nFrom the above-mentioned verses, we come to know that Allah does not love the disbelievers and sinful. This means that Allah’s love is restricted to those who believe and obey His commands.  The reason for this is because Allah does not force belief and faith upon mankind. Allah has given man the freedom to choose his or her own fate. If a person uses this free will to obey Allah, then he or she will be deserving of Allah’s love. However, if a person uses this free will to disobey and disbelieve in Allah, then he or she will be deserving of Allah’s wrath and punishment. \n\n \n\nOne should also note that it is from the love of His creation that Allah Ta’ala gives every human being the ability to choose guidance and paradise by obeying His commands and following His guidance. However, it is from the wretchedness of mankind that one chooses to disobey and ignore His guidance.\n\n \n\nIt is the love and compassion of Allah that He sends Messengers and Prophets for every age to call mankind towards the obedience of Allah; however, it is from the misery of mankind that one rejects their call.\n\n \n\nIt is from the love and compassion of Allah that He has sent down a miraculous and safeguarded Quran guiding man toward all that is good. However, it is from the wretchedness of mankind that one disregards its teachings.\n\n \n\nIf Allah willed, he could have forced faith and obedience upon all mankind; however, without having free will, faith would lose its value. Allah mentions in the Holy Quran,\n\n \n\nوَلَوْ شَاء اللّهُ لَجَعَلَكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً وَلكِن يُضِلُّ مَن يَشَاء وَيَهْدِي مَن يَشَاء وَلَتُسْأَلُنَّ عَمَّا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ\n\nIf Allah had willed, He would have made you into one Ummah (group); however, He leaves misguided whomsoever He pleases and He guides whomsoever He pleases, and you will definitely be question regarding what you used to do.” (16:93)\n\n \n\nAllah does not want to punish mankind. Allah wants all of mankind to be successful and prosperous. However, it is man himself who chooses misguidance and agony.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n \n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai \n\n \n\n \n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n \n\nDISCLAIMER – AskImam.org questions\n\nAskImam.org answers issues pertaining to Sharī’ah.
