  "question": "re: q1087 - how many times(2 / 3) does one's wudhu have to break before one becomes a mazur?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have the rules regarding a mazur, but I am uncertain WHEN to follow them. Query about answer 1087 regarding wudhu that keeps breaking by passing wind: For eg. how many times(2 / 3) does one's wudhu have to break before one becomes a mazur ? And at what stage is one no longer a mazur? For eg. if one reads one complete namaaz with one wudhu. Note: this regards a person who does not have a medical condition. Jazakallah Was-Salaam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA person who does not find sufficient amount of time to make Wudhu and\nperform Salaat because of any such reason (bleeding, etc.) which continues\nthroughout one full Salaat period, will be regarded as Ma'zoor.\n\nThe excuse must be continuous - for one full Salaat period. If a person\nmanages to keep his Wudhu for 5/10 minutes in the entire Salaat period with\nwhich he is able to perform his Salaat, then he will not be a Ma'zoor. We\nare unable to determine whether you are a Ma'zoor or not, hence, there is no\nneed to discuss when and how to follow the laws of Ma'zoor. Please explain\nto us in detail the exact problem that you are experiencing so that we can\ndetermine whether or not you are a Ma'zoor.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
