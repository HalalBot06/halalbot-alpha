  "question": "I would like to know whether it is permissible to go inside the dead sea for the medical benefits?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\njazakallah sister in islam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] was returning from Tabuk to Madinah Munawwarah, he passed Hijr (the ruins of the nation of Thamud). Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, 'Do not enter the houses of those who have oppressed themselves but in the state of crying, perchance you will be afflicted with what they have been afflicted with (the punishment of Allah).' Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] then covered his head and passed the valley as quick as possible. (Bukhari vol.2 pg.637; Qadeemi)\n\nThe Muhadditheen have stated that it is not advisable to go to places which were afflicted with the punishment of Allah. If there is a need, then one will be excused. (Hashiya Bukhari; Ibid).\n\nA person suffering from a disease may treat him/herself through the dead sea if there is no other form of cure. Going to the dead sea will be due to need and necessity and not form mere tourism and entertainment.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
