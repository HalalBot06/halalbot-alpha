  "question": "After Sehri and Fajr salaah, if you go back to sleep, thereafter when you wake up, is it permissable to brush ones teeth with toothpaste. Does this nullify the fast?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOne should not use toothbrush and toothpaste during the fast.\n\nOne should rather use a Miswaak. However, if somebody did use toothpaste, but nothing went down the throat, the fast had not broken. However, it should not be done in future.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
