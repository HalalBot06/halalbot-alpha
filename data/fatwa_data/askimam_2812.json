  "answer": "QUESTION\nIt is known that if we say something against someone(parents/relatives/neighbours/friends) at their back, then such type of sins can be forgived by the same person only. I would like to know whether such sins can be forgived (by tawba) after Haj 2.Please let me know the reason for avoiding use of lipsticks. As far as I know it is restricted because of use of some haram product in preparation of lipsticks. If we use high quality lipsticks there is no such content and we can use it.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\na) Allah is indeed merciful and forgiving. His magnanimity is of such a%0D%0Anature that he states \"oh my servants who have wronged themselves despair%0D%0Anot of the mercy of Allah ,verily Allah forgives all sins. Indeed he is all%0D%0Aforgiving, merciful\" Provided a person turns to Allah in repentance, he can%0D%0Again complete forgiveness. The requisites of taubah are 3 (1) to immediately%0D%0Aabstain from the sin.(2)To regret and wish one had never indulged in the%0D%0Asin.(3)To make a determined intention not to return to the sin. If the sin%0D%0Ais related to Huqooqul Ibaad(rights of the creation),it is also necessary to%0D%0Amake reparation to right the wrong.(Ruhul ma\"ani Vol28 Pg235 Maktaba%0D%0AHaqqaaniyya)%0D%0Ab) use of lipstick has the ffg disadvantages.%0D%0A-Prevents the permeation of water through the skin at the time of wudhu,thus%0D%0Ainvalidating the wudhu.%0D%0A-It is usually applied by Kuffaar women and those who donot observe the laws%0D%0Aof Hijaab(Shari concealment).Such persons are termed as fussaaq and fujjaar%0D%0Ain the sharia(flagrant violaters of the divine commandments).A muslim should%0D%0Anot adopt the shi'aar(characteristics)of the fussaaq.%0D%0AAlthough there is some scope for it's usage,provided the laws of hijaab are%0D%0Aobserved,it is not encouraged.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
