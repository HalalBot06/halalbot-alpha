  "question": "What is the meaning of a dream if someone sees Allah Ta'ala in a dream inany form as a human being or even feel His presence?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf a person wants to marry a non-Muslim lady who had been married formerly, should he wait 4 months and 10 days (Iddat time) before proposing her or marrying her?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDream%0D%0AThe interpretation of this dream depends on the condition of the person. If%0D%0Ahe is straight and upright person, it is a Mubaarak (blessed) dream. If he%0D%0Ais not straight and upright, it could be that he is a liar.%0D%0A%0D%0AMarriage%0D%0AIt is not permissible for a Muslim female to marry a non-Muslim male.%0D%0AHowever, a Muslim male may marry only Christian or Jewish female. It is not%0D%0Apermissible for a Muslim male to marry any other non-Muslim female.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe reason it is permissible for the Muslim male to marry a non-Muslim%0D%0Afemale is that he would be able to easily convince the Christian or Jewish%0D%0Awife into accepting Islam. There is a possibility of the non-Muslim male%0D%0Aconvincing his Muslim wife into abandoning Islam. Therefore, Islam has%0D%0Aconsidered her feminine nature and protected her correct beliefs from being%0D%0Aa victim of abuse from the male dominance.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Muslim husband is not obliged to pressurise his Christian%2FJewish wife to%0D%0Aaccept Islam. He may apply wisdom and diplomacy and only influence her to%0D%0AIslam. In Islam, a female is equally respected as a male, however, due to%0D%0Athe different masculine and feminine natures, Islam believes in separation%0D%0Aof roles. It is obvious that there are many things a male can do, which is%0D%0Anot easily possible for a female and vice versa.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
