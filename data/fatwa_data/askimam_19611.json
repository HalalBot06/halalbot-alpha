  "question": "Is permissible to hire Ahle Hadith?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissible for Muslim girls school in the UK (which has mature girls), to keep a Ahle Hadith (who is not religious) as the manager of the school and is it permissible to put him in the office of the school?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nA manager of a school is responsible to administer the issues of the school. As such he holds a senior position with great power and influence. The impact of such a person’s influence will definitely leave its mark on those around and under him.\n\nEducation of children is an Amānat. Generally children are naïve and vulnerable to whatever they are exposed to. They will absorb whatever they are taught. The sense of distinguishing between right and wrong is still not present. This is a time when this is created. What they learn will be carried by them in their lives. If proper values were instilled then this will be exemplified in their lives and the same would be said for the opposite.\n\n \n\nإِنَّ هَذَا الْعِلْمَ دِينٌ ; فَانْظُرُوا عَمَّنْ تَأْخُذُونَ دِينَكُمْ\n\n“Verily this knowledge is religion, so be cautious in who you take your religion from.”\n\n \n\nIn order to nurture children with the correct philosophy and ways we should be very sensitive and selective in the type of people and environment we submit our children to.\n\nIf the manager or administrator of a school is one who’s thinking and values are in line with the teachings of our Prophet salallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam, Sahabah radhiyahllāllu῾anhum, pious predecessors and elders rahimahumullāh who adhere to following a particular Mazhab, we can have a level of assurance that the development of our children are in safe hands. But where this is not the case, it is a cause of concern. We should always look at the best interest of our children and their Deen.\n\n\nWe make Dua Allah Ta῾ālā guides our leaders and makes us the true flag bearers of Islam.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Ali bin Cassim\n\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nLos Angeles, CA (USA)\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
