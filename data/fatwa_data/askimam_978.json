Thereafter, he said, ?Verily your blood, your wealth and your respect is honoured like the honour of this day, month and place.? (Bukhari)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above Hadith emphasises the importance of the respect of a believer. It is not permissible to disgrace and humiliate a Muslim. The humiliating act of placing a parent?s name on the Musjid noticeboard due to them not paying fees is strictly prohibited. The committee should refer their difficulties and queries to Ulama and seek their advise. By not doing so, they may make similar grievous errors.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe committee members are obliged to render an apology to the parents in person and by placing the apology on the noticeboard.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
