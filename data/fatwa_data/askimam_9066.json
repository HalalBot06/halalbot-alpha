You should make Du'aa that Allah Ta'ala takes you to the blessed lands of Makkah and Madinah. Once you are there, you should utilise your time profitably in Ibaadah (worship) and supplicating to Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. You should inform your parents of your intentions and get their guidance on the matter. Marriage is a major step in one's life and if it is not done correctly, the consequences could be disastrous. Secondly, you should understand that marriage is not only enjoying oneself, but is coupled with with great responsibility. Therefore, you should ask yourself if you are prepared to shoulder all these responsibilities.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. It is Haraam (prohibited) to have any communication with the opposite gender. This is the plot of Shaytaan, he gets his Haraam done via actions which seem to be good and beneficial. Nabi [sallallaahu Alayhi wasallam] said, 'When a strange man and women are together, Shaytaan is the third'. Therefore, you should be cautious and refer them to another reliable person of the same gender.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
