  "question": "word MECCA means \"Sharab Khaana\"(bar or pub). So lets all of us be careful of writing MECCA. Many people whose name start with Muhammed, write in a short form as \"Mohd\". This \"Mohd\" means \"A dog which has a big mouth",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI received below email from a friend. Would like to know whether he is correct ?\n\nAssalamu Alaikum, Its been observed that most of us write \"MOSQUE\" for \"Masjid\" and even calling it as Mosque in daily routine, what elders and teachers say that the word \"MOSQUE\" means the house of mosquitoes not Masjid. So better be careful next time instead of writing mosque, u can write MASJID it doesn't matter.. Most we have seen the spelling of MAKKAH as MECCA. The word MECCA means \"Sharab Khaana\"(bar or pub). So lets all of us be careful of writing MECCA. Many people whose name start with Muhammed, write in a short form as \"Mohd\". This \"Mohd\" means \"A dog which has a big mouth\". Guys please forward this message to as many muslims as possible.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe advise to call a Mosque a Musjid, spell Makkah instead of Mecca and spell Muhammad in full is correct.\n\nHowever, the reasoning behind mosque being mosquito, Mecca being a pub and Mohd being a dog is not correct.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
