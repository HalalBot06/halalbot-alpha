  "question": "Will the whole community be sinful if no one sit for Sunnah I'tikaaf?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n\n    1. In the last 10 nights of Ramadhan, if nobody makes a Masnoon I'tikaf in the Masjid, however, there's always somebody spending time for a Nafl I'tikaf over there in such a way that, there's almost not a moment wherein nobody is at the Masjid for I'tikaf, in such a case, will the entire community still become sinful? A man from our locality who was supposed to spend his ten nights I'tikaf couldn't make it because of an emergency of looking after his mother who fell down sometime back. So in this case where we couldn't yet find a person to spend Masnoon I'tikaf in time I.E. at sunset of the twentieth day of Ramadhan, can the Nafl I'tikaf be done in such a way that brothers have turns in making Nafl I'tikaf if they can't make a Masnoon one or what if someone decides to make a complete Masnoon I''tikaf afterwards but its initial time has already past, like for example it's already on the twenty-second day of Ramadhan etc. is it still possible for him to make Masnoon I'tikaf then and make up for the missed days later on?\n\n2. Is it permissible to travel to a far distant land on a Friday knowing that a person wouldn't catch up with the Jumu'ah prayer anywhere? Or is it compulsory to wait until the local Jumu'ah is complete. The city where we usually go to buy our necessities is about 3 hours away and there's no Masjid on the way.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIn principle, it is sunnah Mu’akkadah alal kifayah(emphasized sunnah) to perform Itikaaf in the last ten days of Ramadhan starting from the sunset of 20th Ramadhan till the end of Ramadhan. It is mustahab (preferable) to perform itikaaf in every Masjid of the locality. However, it will be sufficient to perform itikaaf in one of the Masajid in Mahallah or Baladah.(Locality and Town)\n\n(Ahsanul Fatawa, Vol.4, Pg.508,Saeed)\n\n(Fatawa Mahmoodiyyah, Vol.10, Pg. 221, Farooqiyyah)\n\nIt will be a great deprive if no one from the entire community willing to spend 10 days for Masnoon Itikaaf. Hence, the entire community will be sinful. After the sunset of 20th Ramadhan, Masnoon Itikaaf won’t take place. Nafil Itikaaf is not a replacement for Sunnah Itikaaf. Therefore, the entire community should repent sincerely and seek forgiveness of Allah jalla jalāluhu.\n\n(Fatawa Mahmoodiyyah, Vol.10, Pg. 223, Farooqiyyah)\n\n \n\nAt the outset, If a person is travelling to a Shar’I distance i.e, (48 miles), he will be regarded Musafir. Hence, Jummah Salah will not be compulsory on a Musafir. However, if a person is sure that he is going to missed out Jummah Salah, it would be preferable for him to leave after Jummah Salah.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl.
