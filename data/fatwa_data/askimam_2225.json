  "question": "responsiblity of fathers to the children ? How can a father be made to be responsible financially in providing for his children and wife ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow can a father be made to be responsible financially in providing for his children and wife ?, I have been seperated for 3 years, my in-laws have turned a blind eye and condone their sons' untoward behaviour and bad habits and have been more irresponsible than their son by telling me that I should divorce their son. Can I hold his parents financially responsible in providing for the children ?, after all I was living in their house for 7 years and then my father in law ordered me to leave the house as apparently was NOT changing their son to a better person, their son smokes drugs and was abusive and violent to me. Should I do Istakara to guide me, although I know deep down he will not change, and think I am better off remarrying a decent man ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe sympathise with your plight, may Allah Ta?ala grant you aafiyah, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou may not marry another man until your present husband does not issue you a Talaaq (divorce) and your Iddah (waiting period) has not ended. If you are still married to him, then he is responsible for your financial needs. If he has divorced you and the Iddah has completed, he is not responsible for your financial needs. However, he will be liable to support his children.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe grandparents cannot be held responsible to financially support their grandchildren. Since you say that he is on drugs and does not support you at present, this could be possible grounds for the annulment of the Nikah. Consider the matter carefully and make Istikhaara and Mashwarah (consultation with the trustworthy wise Deeni persons). If you then decide to separate, approach your local Ulama and explain your predicament. They will then follow up the due procedures for the annulment of the Nikah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0Afor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
