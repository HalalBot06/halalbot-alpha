  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\n Please Tell me in Detailed if Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) solely for the Arabs ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nRasulullah (SAW) is the final prophet and messenger of Allah. There is no prophet to come after Rasulullah (SAW). Allah sent prophets to guide mankind. All the previous prophets came for a particular nation and a particular time. Rasulullah (SAW) is the last prophet and therefore he is for all mankind forever. Rasulullah (SAW) is for Arabs and non-Arabs. Allah says, “And we did not send you but as a mercy for the worlds” (Ambiya).\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
