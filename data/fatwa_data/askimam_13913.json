  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nif we get to masjid and we find out that jamat is over..canÂ few brother make thier own jamat in the back of masjid?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is Makrooh to make a second Jamaat in a proper Musjid after the first Jamaat. If a few brothers missed the Jamaat, then they should perform their Salaat individually without any Adhaan or Iqaamat. (Fataawa Rahimiyah vol.4 pg.134)\n\nHowever, Jamaat can be made in the Sehn of the Musjid or in a Musallah (not proper Musjid).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
