Also if we can throw these magazines or letters with names like muhammed or other sahaba names in the garbage? will it be unrespectful? 4.also if a women can keep her face open only during ihram if it is very hard to cover with the baseball cap being with small children? 5.I recently was applying super glue to something and after 4 or 5 days noticed a small amount about 2 or 3 mustard seed size spot on my fingernail, I scratched it witg my teeth and it came off, my question is will this very thin layer of super glue on my nail make all my salats and ghusl void? will I have to repeat all the past 4 or 5 days salats?If u can also give me some dua for being afraid at the smallest things and the dark. Jazakallah amd MAy Allah reward u for your time and effort. Ameen\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. He is not allowed to read any type of book or magazine whilst in the toilet.\n\n2. Refer 1 above.\n\n3. To some extent, it would be disrespectful to dispose of them in the garbage. If the magazine is an un-Islamic magazine, you may dispose of it in the trash can.\n\n4. It is permissible for her to leave her face exposed in the state of Ihraam.\n\n5. This thin layer of glue would have prevented water penetrating. Hence, the Salaats performed since then should be repeated.\n\n6. Recite Aayaatul Kursi in abundance ? especially after every Fardh Salaat and before you retire at night.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
