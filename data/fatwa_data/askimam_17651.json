  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs per Quran saying, for pious men there will be pious women. As per my understanding it means that if I am pious I will then able to get pious women (wife) and what character I have either good or bad, I will get women (wife) of same character as of mine. Is this true or otherwise? Please clarify me in light of Quran and sunnah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nThe verse of the Holy Quran referred to in your query is in Surah an-Nur:\n\nالخبيثات للخبيثين والخبيثون للخبيثات والطيبات للطيبين والطيبون للطيبات\n\n“Vile women are for vile men, and vile men are for vile women; and good women are for good men, and good men are for good women” (24:26)\n\nThis verse immediately follows the verses which explain the slandering against Sayyidina A’isha (RadiyAllahu Anha) and states a general principle that Allah Ta’ala has created a connection between people of the same nature. It is common to see vulgar and unchaste women inclined towards vulgar and unchaste men and vice-versa.\n\nIn light of this principle, Allah Ta’ala mentions this verse here to show that all of the Prophets (Alayhimus Salaam), who are the models and symbols of modesty and chastity, were granted spouses in accordance to their status. Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasalaam) who was the head of the Messengers was also bestowed with spouses in accordance to his position and status in purity and chastity. Out of his spouses, A’isha (RadiyAllahu Anha) was most beloved to him. Therefore, how can it be possible for one with the status of A’isha (RadiyAllahu Anha) to commit the act which some accused her of? Those who had doubts or suspicion on her did not have true faith in Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nIt is not in every case where one will have a spouse of the same nature. For example, Fir’aun was evil-natured, but his wife ‘Asiyah (May Allah be pleased with her) was opposite and she eventually became a believer. The abovementioned verse states a common, general principle and was revealed for the reason to show the innocence of A’isha (RadiyAllahu Anha). As Muslims, it is important for us to abide by the laws of Allah Ta’ala and follow the Sunnah of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) at all times. InshaAllah after this Allah Ta’ala will bless one with a pious spouse and pious offspring.\n\n(Ma’ariful Quran, 6/392)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\nMl.
