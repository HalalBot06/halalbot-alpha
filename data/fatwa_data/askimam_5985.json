  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaam mufti Saab could you please assist me? (1) I just wanted to know if I could read my namaz with my sather covered and a T-shirt on. (2) What if I try my best when I ghusl to wet every hair but unknowingly don?t and might miss a hair will I still need to do it again, I just ask this generally? (3) Is there any duaas that could help me get through university which I start in September inshallah? (4) Is my earning haraam is where I work they sell alcohol and that I work in the food department aswell, but all I do is fill the shelves in the food department, It is also owned by jews, but jews own everything now where I live?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In a T-shirt, the hands will be uncovered. It is Makrooh to perform\nSalaat with the hands uncovered.\n2. When making Ghusl, one should wash the hair as thoroughly as possible.\nAfter doing so, there is no reason to doubt any hair being left unwashed.\n3. Recite, 'Rabb inniy maghloobun fantasir' as much as possible.\n4. What do you mean by food department? If, by 'food department', you mean a\nsupermarket where groceries are sold, then your income will be Halaal.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
