  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy husband in anger said tallak tallak tallak tallak 4 time on the phone and then told me to shut the phone i like to know does divorce happen with him just saying tallak four times please let me know\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\nBy your husband uttering the divorce four times as you have stated, the divorces will be valid and effective. His wordings constitute three irrevocable divorces, i.e. with immediate effect, your marriage terminates and both of you will compulsorily have to desist from having any form of relationship. Furthermore, you cannot remarry him unless undergoing the process of halālah, i.e. if after this, you happen to marry someone else and due to circumstance that marriage terminates, by death of the spouse, divorce, an Islamic separation, etc. can you now remarry this husband.[1]\n\n(Fatāwā Alamghīriyyah Vol.1 Pg.353, Rashīdiyyah)\n\n(Fatāwā Mahmudiyyah Vol.12, Pg.425, Fāruqiyyah)\n\nA point to note here also is that your husband’s statements will constitute three divorces, equally whether he repeated the words of divorce for emphasis or not.\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n\n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftāa\n\n\n\n\n [1]و اذا قال لامرأته انت طالق و طالق و طالق و لم يعلقه بالشرط ان كانت مدخولة طلقت ثلاثا (الفتاوى الهندية , كتاب النكاح , الباب الثانى فى ايقاع الطلاق)"
