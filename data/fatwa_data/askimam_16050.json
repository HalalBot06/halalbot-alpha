  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSome people say that, it is not permissible for a Msalli to pray with a Turban when the Imam is not wearing a Turban.They say if this is done then the Prayer of the congrgation becomes Makrooh. Is there any basis for this? What is the ruling of Shariah on this? Please enlighten us\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe salaah performed whilst wearing a turban is more virtuous than the salaah performed without a turban. However, there is no undesirability in the salaah performed without a turban. Similarly, it is permissible for the congregation to wear turbans even if the Imam is not wearing a turban. There will be no undesirability in the salaahs of the congregation or the Imam.\n\n (Fatawa Rasheediyah Pg.326 – Muhammed Ali Kar Khana)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
