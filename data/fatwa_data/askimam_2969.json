  "question": "Which parts of the private parts need to be shaven?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIt is obligatory to shave before before 40 days, if you do not every salah will be makruh? We muslims need to know exactly which part to shave, as we are not sure. So please answer the following questions (each one on it's own). 1) Directly below the navel (belly button) does not need to be shaven (correct), but the pubic hair above the testicals and penis, which is apparent in every male and female needs to be shaven? 2) Does pubic hair on the testicals need to be shaven (all or part of it, see Q4). 3) Does hair on the penis need to be shaven. 4) The testicals are LINKED and kind of EXPAND (stretch) to the anus hole (bottom of the testicals). Does this hair need to be shaven? 5) Does all hair on the anus need to be shaven? jazakallah hair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\n1.
