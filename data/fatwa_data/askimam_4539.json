  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1) The son should in a polite manner bring their attention to the severity\nof their sin. He should also make Dua for their guidance. If he feels that\nit may be counterproductive to approach them directly, he should ask a\nfriend of theirs, or a respectable member of the community to approach them.\nIf this too appears to be counterproductive, then simply make Dua for them.\n2) The principles on which the Tablighi Jamaat operate are to be found in\nthe Qur'aan and Sunnah. Please refer to the books 'Fazaa-il A'maal and\nHayaatus Sahaaba for details. Both are available in English.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
