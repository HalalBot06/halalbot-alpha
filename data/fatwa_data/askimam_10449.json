  "question": "does the 60 days have to be consecutive? If so if you miss one day do to illness do you have to start the 60 days all over again?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI entered Islam when I was 18 yrs old during the last week of Ramadan and did not fast. I thought fasting and salat were something we were to do but did not understand the importance of fasting and salat. I did not fast the couple of days during Ramadan in witch I embraced Islam and missed one day the following Ramadan. How do I make this up? Do I fast the days I missed or do I have to fast 60 days for each day I missed or 60 for each Ramadan. I have been Muslim now for 12 years and these are the only times I broke my fast without reason, however, I do have fasting I have to make up for pregnancy and menses. Can I start making up those days first or do I have to fast the 60 days first being that it was my first and second Ramadan? Also does the 60 days have to be consecutive? If so if you miss one day do to illness do you have to start the 60 days all over again?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe fasting for 60 days, i.e. Kaffarah is only if you started a fast and thereafter broke it. As you didn't do that all you have to do is keep the fasts that you missed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
