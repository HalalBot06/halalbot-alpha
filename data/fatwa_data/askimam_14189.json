  "question": "A friend of mine is Shia I asked him about his belief",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nA friend of mine is Shia I asked him about his belief. He said the only difference between us and them is they believe the first Caliph should have been Ali r.a. The companions stole that right from Ali r.a and the leadership should have been from within the family of the prophet.\n\nCan you please explain if Ali.ra. Had any objections as the Shia’s claim?\n\nShouldn’t the leader have been the son in law and the cousin of mohammed s.a.w?\n\nI have read this,  Many of the Muslims of Medina refused to give their allegiance, their bay'ah, to Abu Bakr -- as did Ali. They were known as the Shi'at Ali, the party of Ali, or, by their enemies, the Rafida, or Refusers. The Shi'a say that it took six months of threat and pressure to force the refusers to submit to Abu Bakr. Umar roamed the streets of Medina with his warriors, they say, threatening the holdouts. He even threatened to burn down Fatima 's house unless Ali came out and submitted to Abu Bakr. Ali refused; Umar pushed his way into the house; Fatima, who was heavily pregnant, was crushed behind the door. She miscarried of a stillborn son, whom the Shi'a mourn as Al Muhsin. She had been mortally injured by Umar and soon died. Ali buried her at night, secretly, as he did not wish Abu Bakr or Umar, whom he blamed for her death, to attend her funeral. The Shi'a thus blame Abu Bakr and Umar for the death of Muhammad's daughter and grandson.\n\nIs this fabrication of the real events which took place? Please could you go through the events in detail as to clarify any misunderstandings which seem to be caused by certain groups.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nUNBRIDGEABLE DIVIDE\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe protracted contrariety between Islam and Shi’ism is but a clear reflection of fundamental differences between the two. The only common denominator between Islam and Shi’ism is the Islamic Kalimah. The rest of Shi’ism has very little in common with mainstream Islam. The unbridgeable divide between the two is entrenched in some of the core fundamentals of this sect, such as:\n\n* THE TWELVE IMAAMS\n\nImaamah is a divine station like Nubuwwat. This implies that Sunnis, who do not believe in Imaamah, are unbelievers. According to their beliefs, Allah had chosen twelve men to succees Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). The twelfth Imaam however disappeared at the age of five. He is believed to be the awaited Mahdi.\n\n* THE STATUS OF THE IMAAMS\n\nThe Imaams possess more knowledge than the Ambiyaa. They are superior to the Ambiyaa and the entire creation. The Imaams can bring the dead back to life. No knowledge of the heavens and the earth is hidden from them.\n\n* THE INTERPOLATION OF THE NOBLE QUR’AN\n\nThe Qur’an is incomplete and distorted in its present form. This tenet had been explicity propounded by the classical scholars of Shi’ism, but frugally denied by the contemporary scholars.\n\n* VILIFICATION AND APOSTASY OF THE SAHAABA\n\nThe Sahaaba were guilty of wilfully distorting and corrupting the Deen of Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). They turned renegade after the demise of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) except the immediate household of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\n* THE PERMISSIBILITY OF MUT’A\n\n* VIRTUES OF TAQIYYA\n\nIslam and Shi’ism are two parallel streams of thought that can never converge. They are as distinct from each other, as is Islam to the Ahlul-Kitaab.To ignore these differences is to ignore the stark reality.\n\nThe often repeated hallowed call for \"Muslim Unity\" simply serves as a smokescreen, behind which Shi’a missionaries penetrate Muslim societies. Any attempt to resist this imposition is branded as \"divisive\". Would it be divisive to protect Islam from a sect that inherently debases the Qur’an, the Ambiyaa, and the Sahaaba? Unity can only be forged on the basis of Aqeedah (belief). To label these differences as ‘hair splitting issues’ is to undermine the sanctity of the Qur’an, the Ambiyaa and the Sahaaba unity at the cost of the Qur’an is tantamount to blasphemy.\n\nThe constitution of our country guarantees religious freedom. The Shi’as therefore have the right to propagate their beliefs. However, they need to come out of the closet and do so under the banner of Shi’ism.\n\nIssued by: UUCSA"
