  "question": "In Islam, why dogs are considered impure animal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAll creatures are the creation of Allah Ta%E3la and do deserve the recognition of being a creation of the Almighty. As much as Muslims detest even the sight of pigs - it is the creation of Allah Ta%E3la - and because Allah has placed life into it, we cannot inflict pain nor torture the pig. %0D%0A%0D%0ASimilarly Allah Ta%E3la created the dog from among His creation. This does not mean that we should love the dog. It is perhaps the indoctrination of the Western culture that 'The dog is Man's best Friend'. The theory that 'dogs are very dependent on Human affection' is a myth - again culture and custom has helped to develop this unnatural behaviour. %0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta%E3la the Creator of this Universe - having created the dog would surely have known that the dog requires Human affection and love to exist in this world. Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) would have advised us, Muslims, to keep dogs as pets. On the contrary, we are instructed not to keep dogs as pets and 'love' them as exemplified by the non-Muslims. Remember our life is structured and bound by the Shariah i.e. The Noble Qur%E3n and the beautiful example of Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam). Consider these Ahaadith: %0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Talha (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said, \"Angels do not enter a house wherein there is a dog or an animate picture. (Sahih Bukhari Hadith no. 2986) %0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhuma) reports from Hadhrat Maimoona (Radhiyallaahu %C1nha) that once Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) became sad; and said that Jibra'eel (%C1layhis Salaam) promised to meet him at night but did not turn up. \"By Allah what has kept him back,\" said the Prophet (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam). Then he realised a puppy was under his bed. He ordered that the puppy be removed and the area be sprinkled with water. In the afternoon when Jibra'eel (%C1layhi Salaam) came, Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) enquired as to the delay. Jibra'eel (%C1layhi Salaam) said that we, the group of Angels do not enter a house wherein there is a dog or pictures. (Sahih Muslim Hadith no.3928) %0D%0A%0D%0AIn the light of these Ahaadith and other narrations it is not permissible to keep dogs as pets. The household is deprived of the Mercy of Allah Ta%E3la. %0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, Jurists have stated that it is permissible to keep a dog for security purposes, farming and hunting. %0D%0A%0D%0AThe saliva of a dog is Najis (impure). if it touches the clothes or body, that portion also becomes impure and must be washed.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Kadwa%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
