  "question": "For the sake of passing-on reward (Isaal-e-Sawaab) to the deceased, which is better, offerring Qurbaani/Performing Hajj/Umrah, OR giving away equivalent amount in Sadaqa on their behalf?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIsaal-e-Sawaab, i.e. passing on reward to the deceased can be done in any\nform according to the capacity of the person passing on the reward. However,\nit should be borne in mind that whichever action more sacrifice is it given,\nthe reward is also multiplied.\n\nIsaal-e-Sawaab is not only confined to monetary contributions, hence, a\nperson can perform two Rakaats of Nafl Salat and pass on the reward to the\ndeceased. From the three you have listed, in principle all three can be\ncarried out. However, the one that hold the most virtue is the Hajj\n(pilgrimage). Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Whosoever perform\nHajj and guards himself from sin and shameful acts, he returns back\n(cleansed) as the day he was given birth to.'
