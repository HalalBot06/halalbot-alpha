You are correct in your understanding that it is compulsory; however, the reality of its importance has probably not donned upon you yet. Allah Ta’ala has honored the Muslim woman by concealing her beauty and safeguarding her chastity. It is a natural instinct for people to guard, cherish and conceal items of value lest they be stolen, vandalized or corrupted. No one leaves precious gems, stones and jewelry lying about waiting for a thief or bandit to steal, similarly, Allah Ta’ala does not allow the beauty of his female bondswoman to be flaunted and displayed for the lowly and vile people to gawk at.\n\nThe institution of Hijab has been practiced by all the pious and righteous bondswomen of Allah since the creation of mankind. Chastity and modesty are the core morals of a Muslim woman and nothing fortifies such decency like the institution of hijab. You state that you feel like you are only wearing the hijab for the sake of other people and this feeling is inciting you to remove it. You feel that by removing the hijab you will feel more sincere in your spirituality. Although, your aspiration for sincerity is admirable, removing the hijab will not facilitate the spirituality and sincerity that you are seeking. If the problem lies in you showing other people your courage to don the hijab, you merely need to change your intention. You should constantly refocus your attention to the pleasure of Allah and constantly remind yourself that Allah is watching you at all times and that He is pleased with you in the Hijab. You should remind yourself that every action you do is to please Allah who will reward immensely for it by fulfilling all of your wants and desires in Jannah. You should continue wearing your Hijab and worry less about your thoughts of insincerity. Such thoughts are from the side of Shaytan to make you remove your Hijab and disobey Almighty Allah. As you grow older, you will cherish the Hijab feel more comfortable in it. May Allah reward for your efforts and bless you with the sweetness of Iman for carrying out His injunctions. Amin.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nMl. Yusuf bin Yaqub,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
