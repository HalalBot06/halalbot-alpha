  "question": "They said he cannot give the Adhan because he is a Salafi and does not grow a beard",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIn our masjid for almost 2-3 years an elder brother used to come early every Jummah, vacuum & clean the prayer area. He also used to give adhan. Now the people who run the masjid are salafi, said he cannot give the adhan because he does not have a beard. What would be the proper way of doing something like this. This has upset and saddened the elder brother very much.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe elder brother who you have mentioned seems to have a lot of love and affection for the upkeep of the Musjid. That is really heartening to see in these times, when people have lost the importance of Salaat and Musjid.The people of the Musjid are really fortunate in having someone like him.\n\nInstead of dismissing him immediately for his wrongdoing, they should adopt diplomacy by advising him first on the importance of the beard in Islam, because it is possible he is not aware of it. If the brother, after being informed about the beard, still does not keep a beard, then he should be dismissed since it is Makrooh for a Faasiq (open sinner) to give Adhaan or Iqaamat if there are other righteous people present.
