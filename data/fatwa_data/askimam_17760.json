  "question": "I want to move out of home as my family are involved with interest and Haraam",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am having one doubht in my mind, just want to have an advice from you.\n\nI am working as a software Engineer in Bangalore. In May I am going to get married. In my family I am the only guy trying to live according to deen. My father dont listen to me and now and then he takes money from somebody and pays intrest to him. Now he has built one house by taking a loan of 3.5 laks and pays the intrest though he is having land which may cost around 2.5 laks. To clear these debts I am sending money from Bangalore to my house and if tomorrow I marry InshaAllah, I have to keep my wife at my house only. Because if I keep her with me I cannot help my family and I dont want to be away from her due to the risk of sin. I want to tell my parents to sell that land but they dont listen to me. My parents are becoming very old and sometimes I feel it is very necessary to be with them. I want to be with them and make them to follow deen.\n\nIn my home town the condition is very worse. Muslim ladies give money for intrest and are involved in other means of haram things. I was a student of Hadrat Maqdoom mohiddin qasimi (db) but now as I am staying away unable to have his companionship. I want to learn Qur'an and become an aalim (my aim and a dream from my childhood) and work for the society.\n\n\nI want to live in my hometown away from my parents because I cannot believe them because they take money for intrest and use for there needs but as well as I cannot leave them alone also.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nWe are extremely overwhelmed to hear that you are the student of Hazrat Maqdoom Mohiddin Qasimi (db).We make dua that Allah Ta’ala fulfills your dream of becoming an Aalim as well as a Haafiz and he accepts you for the service of his Deen. (Aameen)\n\nBefore we embark upon replying to your query relating to your parents we deem it imperative to apprise you that there is no need to compare the maintenance of your future wife to your parents. These are both individual obligations. The son irrespective of his marital or single status remains the son to his parents. Their favours can never be forgotten and neither can anyone ever repay the favour to them. One should be very careful with regards to his parent’s affairs, and hence if any one of them needs assistance he should be present to offer his services financially or in any other way.\n\nHazrat ibn Abbas (Radhiyallahu ‘anhuma)  narrates from the Prophet  (sallallaahu ‘alayhi Wassallam) that a person whose parents are alive and he obeys them, listens to and respects them, then Allah will open two doors of paradise for him. But if one of his parents is not happy with him, then Allah will not be happy with him either. Then someone asked the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi Wassallam), “Even if they are oppressors?” The Prophet replied, “Yes, even if they are oppressors.”  [Recorded in Sahih Muslim]\n\nA person maintains the wife in the capacity of a husband and maintains his parents in the capacity of a son. Surely, there is no injustice in this? Avoiding any one of the obligations is tantamount to the breach of responsibilities set by Allah Ta’ala. Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said,\n\nحدثنا سعيد بن محمد الجرمي حدثنا عبدالرحمن بن عبدالملك بن أبجر الكناني عن أبيه عن طلحة بن مصرف عن خيثمة قال: كنا جلوسا مع عبدالله بن عمرو إذ جاءه قهرمان له فدخل فقال أعطيت الرقيق قوتهم ؟ قال لا قال فانطلق فأعطهم قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم كفى بالمرء إثما أن يحبس عمن يملك قوته\n\n \n\n“It is sufficient to make a person a sinner that he neglects his dependant”.  (Recorded in Saheeh Muslim and Abu Dawud).\n\nIslam places much emphasis with regards to the welfare of our parents, in your case even though they have been involved in interest, you should conduct yourself affectionately & warmly towards them. You should project the shariah to your parents in a fine-looking way by explaining to them the impermissibility of taking & giving interest, together by making dua that Allah Ta’ala should tender their hearts.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
