  "question": "I was informed that, one gets multiple (70) times reward for performing virtuous deeds on a Friday, is this for any good deed (like Salaat, charity, etc.), or only certain ones, like Dhikr of Durood?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nNow that today is Friday (11/16/01), and also Ramadan (1st), does this reward gets multiplied to even more, if so to what?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We cannot recall any narration that mentions that all deeds are\nmultiplied 70 times on a Friday. If you could provide a reference, we can\ncheck further. Please find attached, 'Virtues of Jumu'ah'.\n2. The virtues of Ramadhaan will be multiplied by the virtues of Jumu'ah,\nthus, making it multiplied in virtue. Refer attached, 'Virtues of fasting.'\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
