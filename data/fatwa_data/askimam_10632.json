  "question": "Is my activity as a corporate lawyer is prohibited by the hadith below, and are there any exceptions?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nFor the attention of Mufti Taqi Uthman: Assalmu alaykum warahmatullahi wa barakatuhu. There is a hadith which states that a curse of Allah shall be invoked upon whom who mediates/writes/witnesses an interest transaction. I work at a large international law firm, and my work involves drafting and negotiating corporate transactions, particularly loan agreements, which naturally involve interest payments. I fear that my professional activity is within the scope of the above hadith. I would appreciate you can give a detailed answer to the above question.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta?ala states that one who is involved in interest is in war with Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said that one who pays interest, the one who receives it, the one who witnesses the transaction of interest and one who who records the transaction are all cursed.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe job description that you have given is one which clearly shows that such a person is a witness to the transaction. In fact, he is very instrumental in dealing with interest. Yes, it is agreed one may get experience in the field of finance, however, to aid the evil generally jeorpadises the integrity of a Muslim. One must strive to earn Halaal, pure sustenance, fulfilling his obligation as father and husband. However, one must fulfil this obligation ensuring purity and also pleasing his Lord and nor earning his wrath.%0D%0A%0D%0AA Muslim who is in such an occupation must not leave his occupation in such a manner that he cannot provide for himself and all his dependants. He must strive to find such an avenue or create the prestine pure system to ensure that the sustenance he attains is Halaal and pure. In doing so, everyone around him, namely his employer, employee, clients, friends and family will also eat Halaal. It is also advised that he ensure that he disposes his Zakaat and gives out charity in abundance with the intention of pleasing the Creator and purifying one?s wealth. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
