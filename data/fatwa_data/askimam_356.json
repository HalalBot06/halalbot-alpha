  "question": "Why is it considered so important to study a particular mathaab? The importance of mithaab to many seems to divide us as an Umma why is this?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTaqleed means to follow.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta%E3la says in the Noble Qur%E3n, 'Ask the learned if you do not know'.%0D%0A). Since our knowledge is limited in Shari%E1h (Qur%E3n and Hadith), we are to%0D%0Afollow the learned %DAlama i.e. to make Taqleed and be a Muqallid.%0D%0A%0D%0ABefore we introduce the book, 'Taqleed' for your reading, note the following%0D%0Aexample:%0D%0AA surgeon performing an operation has a choice to use several methods to%0D%0Aperform the operation viz. Sir John, Hamiltom and Sir Conner's methods. All%0D%0Athese methods are correct. When applied, each method (individually) have to%0D%0Abe carried out in its entirety - the operation cannot be done by applying a%0D%0Alittle of the method of Sir John and a little of Sir Conner's and a little%0D%0Aof Hamilton. Despite all being correct applications, only one method of%0D%0Aapplication may be used for a particular operation each time. Similarly, a%0D%0AMuslim is required to follow one Madhab at a time so as not to confuse the%0D%0Avarious applications. It must be understood that the knowledge of the%0D%0ASahaaba (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) possessed is in no comparison to ours. Hence,%0D%0Aour understanding of the interpretations to the variations of each matter%0D%0Acould cause immeasurable confusion. We hope by reading this booklet, you%0D%0Awill have a clear understanding of the subject matter.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
