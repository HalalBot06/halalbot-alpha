  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI was married to my cousin by force.I didnt want to marry him .even my parents lied to me about his height and age.I am 19 the told me he was around 23 or 24 but then i just found out that he is 28.they told me he was taller than me but then when i married him he was a little shoter than me and fat .I dont love him. he doesnt treat me the way i want him to treat me.plus i feel like they told me to marry him so that i can bring him to america.ive been with him for less than 3 months but we were married for almost 7 month.\nnow im starting to see a guy in school he treats m better than my husband so is it ok for me to get a divorce since i was forced and lied to.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n \n\nAt the outset, you should know that it is harām for you to have casual relations with non-mahram men.  You should stop all communication with the man from your school right away.  In addition to being harām, this is very harmful for your marriage, as well.\n\nIt is unfortunate that you were given incorrect information regarding your husband before marriage and pressured into marrying him.  However, now that you are married, we suggest you give some time to your marriage and try to make things work.  Since you have only been with him for three months, you are probably still trying to get over the false information and the disappointment due to it.  InshāAllah, you will soon overlook this aspect and focus on his good qualities and characteristics.\n\nYou mention that he does not treat you the way you want him to treat you.  Have you discussed this issue and your expectations with your husband?  If you have and you still have complaints, then we suggest you involve an elder family member or a local 'Ālim for marriage counseling.  If all honest attempts at trying to save the marriage fail, then your local 'Ālim can advise you on the next steps.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMl.  Abrar Mirza\n\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
