  "question": "My parents are Muslims, but they stop me from growing a beard, especially mother. Should I grow beard or obey them?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nFurthermore, is it included in the rights (huqooq) of parents to stop their children from following the sunnah. Please answer with reference to Qur'an and Sunnah, so that i can be convinced myself and then be able to convince my parents.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n'For Muslim males to grow a beard is Waajib (compulsory), and to let it grow\na fist length is Waajib. Without any Shar√©e reason to cut or shave is Haraam\n(totally prohibited). He who does so is a Faasiq (sinner) and to shorten it\nless than a fist length is Makruh Tahrimi (near Haraam).' Dari Aur Ambiyaa\nKi Sunnate, Mufti Saeed Palanpuri.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
