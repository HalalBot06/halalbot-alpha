  "question": "Is the husband of a girl mahram for her wife's sisters. Can the sisters of the wife go out or talk with their sister's husband.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSuppose a girl who has sisters gets married. Will the husband of this girl be mahram for her sisters. Can the sisters of these girls go out or talk with their sisters husband. In bahesti zevar by maulana ashraf ali thanvi(r.a) it is written that two sisters cannot be married at a time to one man. However after the wife is dead the man can marry her sister. Does this imply that so long as the sister is alive her husband will be their mahram as marriage is not allowed. Please give a detailed reply.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA brother-in-law (sister?s husband) is a Ghayr Mahram (not prohibited in marriage) to his sisters-in-law (wife?s sisters). If the wife passes away, then the brother-in-law may marry his deceased wife?s sister.\n\nThe sister-in-law must observe Hijaab from the brother-in-law. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?The brother-in-law is death?. The Hadith implies that not maintaining Hijaab from the brother-in-law, for example, free talking, joking, etc. has a potential of causing spiritual death.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
