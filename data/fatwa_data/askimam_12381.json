  "question": "Is it permissible in Islam to have friendship(not close) with the non-muslims through chatting on the internet?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI had some non-muslim friends with me. I chatted with them regularly but a Muslim friend of mine told me it is not permitted in Islam so I stopped chatting with them but i m still confused. So tell me whether its a sin to have a chat with non-muslims or it is permissible in Islam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOne is allowed to mix with non-muslims and chat with them on permissible topics, however they should not be made close friends. This of course is for those of your on gender. Chatting with the opposite gender is prohibited.\n\nYour intention when dealing and chatting with them, should be to invite them towards Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl.
