  "question": "According to a hadith I read in Riyad al Salaheen, Sayyidina Muhammad (pbuh) said that Allah stops forgiving a person once they become 60 years old, is this true?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Allah Ta'ala accepts the\nrepentance of a person right until he breathes his last.'\n\nThe Hadith referred by you does not mean that Allah Ta'ala stops His\nforgiveness upon being 60 years. The Arabic word in the Hadith is\n'A-azarallaahu' meaning 'Allah does not accept an excuse from a person who\nreached the age of 60'. As such a person has been given sufficient time to\nchange his life to be obedient to Allah Ta'ala. The person cannot complain\nof not being given sufficient life.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
