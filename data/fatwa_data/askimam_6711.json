Now her period has arrived, and she realized that she will not be able to fast the whole month. Does she have to make up for these days?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo make an intention to fast the whole month of Rajab does not make fasting\nin Rajab compulsory.\n\nIf your wife did not fast during her monthly cycle, she does not have to\nmake Qadhaa (make up) for those days.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
