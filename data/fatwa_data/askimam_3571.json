  "question": "What is the meaning of the name Rubina?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe are unable to locate an entry for 'Rubina' in our dictionaries. A few\nmatches are as follows:\n1. Raboona (Arabic) - something given to the seller as an extra over and\nabove the agreed price.\n2. Rabbaani (fem. Rabbaaniyya - Arabic) - a person of God.\n\nIt is doubtful that 'Rubina' is an Islamic name. Muslim names should express\ntheir bearers religious identity without any doubt.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
