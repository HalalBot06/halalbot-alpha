  "question": "In our local masjid we were told by someone that salaat-ul-tasbih is bidat. The reason they gave was \"How can you keep count of the amount of times you have read the third kalimah?\"",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThey say that by counting the number of times you are reading the third kalimah, you are not concentrating on your salaat, you are only concentrating on the amount of times you are reading the third kalimah (75 times in each rakaat). Can you provide your answer and comments on the above please. Jazakallah Khair. Please remember me in your du'aas.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSalaat al-Tasbeeh is proven through many authentic Ahaadith. Thus, the ruling of bid?ah and the reason cited for it being bid?ah is baseless.\n\nThe reciting as well as concentrating on the number of Tasbeehs is itself concentration in Salaat. If a person was reciting the Tasbeehs without concentrating on the number of Tasbeehs, then that will be regarded as non-concentration in fulfilling the required number of Tasbeehs in Salaat al-Tasbeeh.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
