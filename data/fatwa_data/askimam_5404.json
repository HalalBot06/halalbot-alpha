  "question": "Is a married woman in parda allowed to stand behind the counter and be in contact with male customers helping her husband?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA wife should not be put through the strains, toils and duties of the\nhusband. She should be allowed to remain at home and see to the household\nchores and the rearing of her children. In most instances, when the wife is\nbusy helping her husband in the shop the children are neglected.\n\nAdditionally, the wife will now come into frequent contact with non-mahram\nmen. Although she may be donning the hijaab, she will still be inviting\nvarious types of fitnah upon herself.\n\nMoreover, when there are other male assistants also working in the shop, her\nmovements will be restricted in the shop. She will be cooped up in the shop.\nHer condition will be further exacerbated during hot climates when she will\nhave to remain in hijaab for long hours in the heat.\n\nIf she has to assist her husband then she may do so by doing some clerical\nwork within the precincts of her home.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim D"
