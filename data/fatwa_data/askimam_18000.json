  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am a new Muslim. I live in a native village in the northern slope of Alaska. Ihave no access to an imam or a shaikh. I ma in desperate need of some definate answers. Out of nowhere my sister was diagnosed with cancer. SHe is refusing to have chemotherapy as her christian beliefs go against this. As a nurse I have attempted to convince her otherwise but to no availe. The cander is in her liver and historically this cancer is very rapid. The Dr.s say she does not have long to live...I do not know her destiny but I would tend to agree. I called to let her know when I would be flying in to see her. Her husband informed me that she and he agreed that I could not come if I was wearing a hijab. Some adivice I have received is that in this situation I do not need to wear hijab others say I do. To avoid conflict I was going to ask her (my sister) if I could wear a hooded jacket. I don't even know if she will agree to this. However, I was told that this is not hijab. I don't want to go through the pain of asking her if this would not even be islamic ally correct. In spite of how ugly she is being towards me I do want to see her. However if it comes down to choosing what she is demanding verses what Allah tells me to do...I can not and will not give in. Please help me...and aya would be appreciated. Jazakum allahu kheir\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n \n\nWe are delighted to see your great bravery and courage to practice on the Deen of Allah. This will definitely not go unrewarded.\n\nIt is clear that you will be violating a few laws of Shariah like not veiling yourself, travelling without a Mahram etc. Therefore, you should really ponder over what benefit will there be if you go. If you have Dhann ghalib (a greater thought) that there will be some benefit, like your sister might accept Islam or you might be able to nurse her etc, then if you do violate some laws of Shari’ah with the hope of some Deeni benefit, then you should repent for that.\n\nIf there is no benefit of you going then rather maintain a phone contact with your sister.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
