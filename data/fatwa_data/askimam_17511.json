  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSince last 4 months my husband asking for Rs.5000/-, which i cant arrange even he is in problem, in this circumtences can a take this amount on interest, because if i will not give to him, he said he will divorced me.can i save my life by taking in interest, if he divorsed me i will sucide.which is haram. plz help me what to do.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nTo take a loan on interest is haram. If your husband threatens to divorce you and that will lead you to commit suicide, then you will be excused for taking an interest bearing loan.\n\nHowever, what if your husband makes a similar demand in the future? How will you pay the loan and interest? We advise you consult a senior person of the town or family to discuss the issue with both of you or only with your husband. The person must command respect and look for a solution to your husband’s problem.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa\n\nImportant Posts and Links\n\n \n\nShar'ii stance on Shares and Stocks|Have you prepared your WILL??|Moonsighting - Its that time to sight the moon"
