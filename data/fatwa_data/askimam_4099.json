  "question": "Clothing worn during monthly mensturation.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear mufti, I would like to know whether it is compulsory for women to wash EVERY item of clothing worn during mensturstion even though they may not have any drops of blood on them. Does this include coats and jackets....because i sometimes have to wear the same coat during salah; so does this invalidate my salah? Jazakalah khairun.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not necessary for a female to wash the clothing worn during menses if\nthey are not soiled with any impurity, blood, etc.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
