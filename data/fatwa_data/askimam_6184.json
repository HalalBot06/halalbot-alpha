  "question": "recently I've been talkin' to ‘jihadis’, who say if Islam brings me peace, I have chosen the wrong religion, they say blood of kafir is halal, it is permissible to kill any nonmuslim",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease could you help me, I am on the verge of losing my iman. I am a recent convert to islam, I converted to islam because of the peace, as well as being convinced its the truth. Very recently I have been talking to come ?jihadis?, who say if Islam brings me peace, I have chosen the wrong religion, they tell me the blood of every kafir is halal, and that it is permissible to kill any non muslim whether they are oppressing you or not. For example, they say it would be permissible to go to somewhere like Bolivia, and kill all the local inhabitants for the sin of not being non-muslim. I have also been told that rape during jihad is permissible. Please save my imaan. They also tell me if I feel sorry for any kafir, I am a munafiq, and I am one of them. Please save my imaan. I work with several Americans, how should my relationship be with them? According to these guys, I should kill them, just for the sin of holding an American passport. Look forward to hearing from you shortly. Jazakallah khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer below our standard reply to a similar query.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nThe statement, 'promoted killing of non-Muslims' is vague and sweeping and\nis very much open to misinterpretation. Yes, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) promoted the killing of these non-Muslims who are actively engaged\nin destroying Islam and the Muslims. This is the command of Allah Ta'ala\nHimself in the Qur'aan. This type of killing is not simply permissible, but\ncommendable and worthy of reward. This does not mean that Islam teaches to\nkill all non-Muslims.\n\nIf, for example, a Muslim intentionally kills a non-Muslim citizen of the\nIslamic state, then in retribution the Muslim's life will be taken. This\nindicates that even the life of a non-Muslim is sanctified, if he does not\noppose Islam and the Muslims.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nF"
