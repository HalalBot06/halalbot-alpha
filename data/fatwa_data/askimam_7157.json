  "question": "from hadeeth(bukhari) it is fard to ghusl for Friday(Jumu-ah), which mathabs(Shafee-i, Hanafi, ...) do this fard, and which consider this a sunnah ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI told a friend that I read a string of ahadeeth saying that Ghusl on Fridays for Jumu-ah is compulsory. He was unsure and said that it's sunnah. Could you clarify kanalah. Then which Math-habs follow this as fard, and which(if any) follow this as sunnah ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to all four Madhabs, Ghusl on the day of Jumu?ah is Sunnah, and not Fardh.\n\nThe Hadith you are referring to applied during the early period of Islam. Later, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) explained that the rule had changed, and that it is no longer Fardh. It, however, remains a Sunnah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
