I make dua that Allah guides you and gives you tawfeeq to do the correct thing.\n\nWhilst we sympathize with you and make dua for you, I wish to offer you my honest and sincere advice. Read my advice carefully and ponder upon it. Do not be emotional. You need to love yourself first and protect yourself.\n\nYou may be aware that Islam prohibits a boyfriend and girlfriend relationship. There are many negative factors in it, some of which you have experienced and suffer the consequences. Had you followed the path of Deen and abstained from such a relationship, you would not have hurt yourself. You are suffering the consequences of the un-Islamic relationship. Guard yourself against abuse and the hungry men waiting to fulfill their sexual appetites through promises and enticements. If the person wanted to marry you, he should have proposed for you. He should have discussed the issue with his family and proceeded with Nikah. How could you be so naïve and actually give him access to you? He now uses you and makes excuses. Nevertheless, all is not lost. You should now do damage control and avoid the situation getting any worse.\n\nFirstly make tawba and repent to Allah for the sinful relationship. Allah is Most Merciful and loves those who repent. He will shower you with His Special Mercy.\n\nSecondly, control your emotions. Love is a two way issue. You cannot simply love the person without him loving you. If he loved you and respected you, he should not have conducted himself as he did. Do not believe his claim of love for you. You too should take charge of your emotions and think carefully. Love yourself first and don’t let anyone cause unnecessary pain to you.\n\nIf the person really wants to marry you, let him get his family to agree and then propose to you in a dignified manner. In the meantime, sever contact with him. If it is destined for both of you to be married, it will be, and if it is not destined it will not be. Condition your mind to submit to the will of Allah and be happy with that.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
