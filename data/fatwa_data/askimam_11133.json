  "question": "I have read a reference that hanging taweez in house or body is prohibited according to Abu Daud? Is that true accoording to other Hadith books?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta%E3la says in the Noble Qur%E3n, 'In the Qur%E3n is (spiritual, physical) cure for people.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThe opening chapter of the Noble Qur%E3n, Surah Faatiha is also called the chapter of Shifaa. It is recorded in the Bukhari Shareef vol. 1 p. , 'A ruler of a certain clan was stung by a creature, the people of the area requested the Sahaaba to cure him, one Sahaabi read Surah Faatiha and blew on the affected area and cured the ruler. The Prophet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) even praised the Sahaabi for doing so.%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the above quotations, it is clear that the verses of the Noble Qur%E3n is a means of cure. Treating oneself with Taweez containing verses of the Qur%E3n is similar to treating oneself with medication. By using medication, one merely places his trust in Allah Ta%E3la and use the medication as a means of cure. The effect in the means is with the Will of Allah Ta%E3la so, too is the usage of the Taweez.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe art of making Taweez is a science independent to other known sciences. People who have studied this science are most knowledgeable to explain its vast understanding. One thing must be outlined at the outset is that anyone practising the making of Taweez cannot ascribe (in his method and application) partners with Allah Ta%E3la. Any act of Kufr is unacceptable in Islam.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe people during the time of Jaahiliyya had an incorrect belief that the stars and planets cause rainfall, but the Prophet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) dismissed that. The drawings and illustrations used in Taweez are like the concepts used in geometry, etc. to arrive at a solution. %0D%0A%0D%0AIn conclusion, consider the following Hadith: Abu Khuzaymah (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) narrates from his father that he asked Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam), 'Inform me about Rukan (blowing in water and Taweez), medication, and means of security, does it change Taqdeer (predestination)? He replied, 'They (all the above) are within Taqdeer. (Mishk%E3t pg. 22)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
