  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalamoAlikum Mufit Saab\n\nhow are you?\n\n \n\n \n\nI have few questions can you please help me.\n\nYou are Sunni right?\n\n \n\n \n\n1.  I am male and I live in . I know there are hadits that says we shouldn't let our pants hang below the ankels. i dont have my pants above ankles all the time but before pray i fold my pants to make sure they are above the ankels. now i have just learnt that there is also hadit(from sahi msulim )that says we should not change the condition of the clothes when praying namaz. i am very confused now,should i fold my pants or no. I know the optimal thing would be to have pants which length is above the ankel. but i dont have those pants so can you plz tell me would be better to fold or let it hang below ankles.\n\n \n\n \n\n2. Is it permissible to wear short sleeves(above elbow), or do we have to wear long sleeves when we pray. Will namaz be valid in short sleeves?\n\n \n\n \n\n3. I have American Eagle shirts. They have eagle symbol/pictures on the shirt. if I wear them and pray would the namaz be valid?\n\n \n\n \n\n4. if my body is napak(unclean) and its namaz time and i can't take shower at the moment. can i still pray(with napak body) or i should pray later as a qaza namaz after taking the shower.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5. I am from hanfi fiqah. Is it true that only seafood we can eat is fish? How about shrimp or crabs?\n\n\nALLAHswt app ko is ka ajar de ....ameen\n\nJazakALLAH Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\n1.   No garment, jubba or trousers should overlap the ankles.\n\nIt is Makhrooh e tahreemee to perform Salah whilst any garment is overlapping the ankles. This means that the Fardh (obligation) of the Salah will be considerd as fulfilled but there is very little sawaab (reward) and benefit in such a Salah .\n\nThe pants of a male should be above the ankles at all times. There are severer warnings mentioned in ahaadith regarding those men who allow their trousers to flow below their ankles.\n\nAllah ta’ala will not even cast a glance of mercy of the day of Qiyaamat towards that person who allows his trousers to flow below his ankles.\n\n(Muslim hadith 290). In another hadith, it is mentioned that whatever clothing flows below the ankles, that portion will be in the fire of hell (Bukhari Hadith5787) If a male’s trousers is below the ankles he should fold it before Salah.\n\n \n\n2. It is Makhrooh (undesirable) to perform the Salah with short sleeves. The full blessing of Salah will be lost.\n\n \n\n3 To wear any garment with a picture of animate objects will be Makhrooh e tahreemi.\n\n \n\n4. It is not permissible to pray Salah in the state of impurity.\n\n \n\n5. According to Imam Abu Hanifa (ra), only fish from the sea is permissible. Crab is not permissible.\n\nShrimps could be eaten but it is advisable to abstain from eating it.\n\n  \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nThe ask imam site will not process questions from October 23 till October 27. You may forward your observations about the site.\n\n \n\nContact the Imam of Croydon Masjid and Islamic Centre for all the talks of Mufti Ebrahim Desai conducted through radio Ramadhan Croydon and Croydon Masjid and Islamic Centre 525 London road, Thornton Heath Croydon, Surry, CR7 6AR\n\nHappy Eid Mubarak to you\n\n \n\nMay Allah accept your ibadat in Ramadhan and grant us all His pleasure and Jannah (Aameen)"
