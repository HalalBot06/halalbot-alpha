  "question": "My friend is working as a teller in a bank.They say that he cant go for jumma as it is very busy during that time.They only allow him to go once or twice a month.He doesnt know what to do.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, it is not permissible to work at a conventional bank as it\ndeals with many un-Islamic matters like interest, insurance, etc. Allah\nTa'ala says, 'And do not aid in sin ...' (Maaidah)\n\nIf one is in dire need, for example, to support dependants, wife and\nchildren and has no adequate source of income, he will be excused. However,\nhe should search for an adequate Halaal source of income and upon that being\navailable, he should resign from the bank.\n\nJummu'ah is a salient feature of Islam. Your friend should exhaust every\npossible avenue to explain his employers the importance of Jummu'ah Salaat\nand make necessary adjustments to be able to perform Jummu'ah Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
