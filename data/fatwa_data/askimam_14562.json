  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. what is the meaning of Hanifa\n\n2. according to a hadith in Bukhari, Isa (as) after his descent will kill the pigs. Does it mean that pigs are bad and we are also supposed to kill them ? Is there any appearant wisdom in creating pigs ?\n\n3. I heard a story which I don't remember clearly now. The story went something as follows: Jesus (as) asked jews to believe in him as a Prophet. Then jews said that in their books it is said a prophet will come before Jesus (as). Jesus (as) sent them to a person and said that he is the prophet that your books predicted of coming before Jesus (as). When jews went to that person, he declined of being that particular prophet. Can you narrate the story in its accurate form and tell the wisdom behind it ?\n\n4. Is there a reward for killing lizards or chameleons? if so then why ?\n\n5. why is it more rewarding to say witr prayers late ?\n\n6. Imam al-Ghazali speaks at length about the stomach and genitals as the two dominant ones; if they are under control, all other aspects of desire are kept in check. Can you please explain the role of stomach in desires.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Separate, independent. In the Qurâ€™aan, Haneefa is mentioned as the quality of Ebraahim (alayhimus salaam) as he kept far from Shirk and Kufr.\n\n2. We have not been ordered to kill pigs now. However, when Esa (AS) will come, he will kill pigs. Allah the most wise does as He wishes. He will question others and He cannot be questioned. Only He knows the wisdom behind creating what ever He has created. This is not something we should involve ourselves in.\n\n3. I am not aware of the story's origins.\n\n4.Yes there is. The Prophet Sallallah Alhi wa Sallam said that the chameleon blew on the fire which Sayyidina Ibrahim was hurled in to. This was its instinctive deed that it did on the promoting of the devil, but its efforts produced no results on the fire.\n\nSo we have been ordered to kill it to protect mankind from its mischief and from its harmful flesh.\n\n5. The Prophet Sallallah Alhi wa Sallam has ordered us to make the witr salath the last prayer of the night. So if someone is habitual of performing tahajjud salath, then he shoulld perform witr after tahajjud. Otherwise, one should pray before one sleeps.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
