Is she allowed to prepare her own food 3.Would the conditions of I'tikaaf be violated is she answered the phone, 4. Could she let her maid in one day in the week 5. If she is allowed to answer the door etc, would it be advisable to hold the weekly ladies T'aleem at her home or not. Jazaakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA female may specify any one portion of the house for I'tikaaf.
