In principal, it is permissible for a wife to use the towel used by her husband if there are no impurities on the towel. The Jurists have advised that one should first wipe the upper part of the body before the lower part of the body. The wisdom behind this is the upper part of the body is free from impurities and the towel will be clean. Impurities are towards the lower part of the body. It is possible that the towel be soiled with the impurities before wiping the remaining body. With the same analogy, it is advisable not to use the towel used by ones husband to wrap his lower body.\n\n2. Recite the following dua after each fardh salah:\n\nالَّهُمَّ اكفِنَا بِحَلالِكَ عَن حَرَامِكَ وَ اَغنِنَا بِفَضلِكَ عَمَّن سِوَاك\n\nAllahumma Akfinaa Bihalaalika `An Haramika Wa Aghninaa Bifadhlika `Am-man Siwaak\n\nOh Allah, Suffice us with (all that is) Halaal from you (and save us) from (all that is) Haram from you and make us independent by your virtue from anyone besides you\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
