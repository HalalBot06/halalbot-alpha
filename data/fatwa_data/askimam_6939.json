Surah Alaq) while performing Salaat.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSajda Tilaawat will be performed like a normal Sajda. Wudhu is a condition.\n\nFace the Qiblah and without raising the hands, recite Takbeer (Allaahu Akbar), going down in the Sajda position. In Sajda, recite Subhaana rabbiyal a'alaa at least 3 times. Thereafter, reciting the Takbeer if you wish to. If you wish, you may arise from the Sajda position into the Tashahhud position. The Sajdah Tilaawat is now complete. There is no need for Salaam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
