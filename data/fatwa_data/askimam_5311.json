  "question": "How does a person perform Salaat, if he/she is restricted to a bed, and answering the call of nature using a bedpan, where there is a good possibility of impurity clinging to their self or clothes.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease explain the procedure for Tayammum, etc. for such a case.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Patients that are bed-ridden normally have people attending to their%0D%0Aneeds and assisting them in such a situation. It is possible for them to%0D%0Aassist them with Salaat preparation. In the unlikely event of having nobody%0D%0Ato assist them at all or do having somebody but such a person before whom%0D%0Aone is not allowed to expose his Satar (private parts), i.e. below the navel%0D%0Ato below the knee for male, then in such a compelling situation, the patient%0D%0Ais allowed to read the Salaat with the impurity on and the Salaat will not%0D%0Ahave to be repeated.%0D%0A2. Wudhu will have to be made for the Salaat. However, if due to the nature%0D%0Aof his illness he cannot make Wudhu, or he cannot reach the water at all and%0D%0Athere is nobody at all to assist him, then he may perform Tayammum.%0D%0A(Tahtaawi pg.129)%0D%0A%0D%0AProcedure for Tayammum%0D%0A1. Niyyat. I am making Tayammum for Wudhu%2FGhusl.%0D%0A2. Strike both hands on earth and dust, thereafter, rub on face.%0D%0A3. Strike for second time and rub both forearms including elbows. Kindly%0D%0Aread authentic Kitaabs on Tayammum for more information.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
