  "answer": "QUESTION\nI did isthiqara for marrying a guy. After Isthiqara, in my dream, I had done isthiqara also and I woke up in my dream and talked to 2 of the guy's friends on the phone and they both told me they think it will happen between us because they got dreams and feelings also. I'm like wow, I did isthiqara last night. (This is all in my dream). I also had my grandmother do Isthiqara and she had a dream about white sweets and she wanted to give some to the Prophet (S).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe indication in the Istikhaara is positive. We advise you also seek the\nMashwara (counsel) of your seniors on the matter.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
