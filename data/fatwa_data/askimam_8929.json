  "question": "Is this correct way for doing qadhaa? salaat 4Farz (Fajr) 4 Farz(Zohr) 4 Farz(Asr) 3Witr (Magrib) and 4 Farz(Isha)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not necessary to maintain sequence in the Qadhaa Salaats as the normal daily five Salaats. Missed Salaats may be performed in any order. However, if a person is a Saahib-e-Tartib (person who did not miss more than 5 Salaats in his life), he has to maintain sequence in performing the missed Salaats.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
