  "question": "In shariah what is the status, if one man gave divorce his wife then again he want her? Can you explain with Hadith?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly explain to me what is Talaaq-e-Raj'ee and Talaaq-e-Baain and their%0D%0Aimplications.%0D%0AA: Talaaq-e-Raji is when a divorce is issued with a word having an express%0D%0Ameaning of divorce, for example, \"I divorce you\". The implication of such a%0D%0Atalaaq is that it can be revoked within the iddat period of three menses if%0D%0Aexperiencing menses or alternatively of three months if not experiencing%0D%0Amenses and not conceived. If conceived, the iddat will be till birth. There%0D%0Ais no need to remarry in order to reconcile. After the expiry of the iddat,%0D%0Athe talaq-e-Raji is converted to a Talaq-e-Baain.%0D%0A%0D%0ATalaq-e-Baain is when a divorce is issued with a word having an indicative%0D%0Ameaning of divorce with the intention of divorce, for example, \"Go away\", \"I%0D%0Adon't want you\". The implication of such a divorce is that it cannot be%0D%0Arevoked even within the iddat period. A re-performance of nikkah is%0D%0Anecessary for a reconciliation. If the husband issued three divorcwes%0D%0Asimultaneously or separately in one sitting or diffrent sittings, it will be%0D%0Avalid and the husband and wife become strangers to one another. They cannot%0D%0Areconcile. However, if two or three talaaq-e-Baains were issued%0D%0Asimultaneously or separately in one sitting or different sittings then only%0D%0Ait will be regarded as one talaaq-e-Baain only.%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A"
