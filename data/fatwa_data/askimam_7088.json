  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) My husband wants me to loose weight. I am breast-feeding. I have noticed that if I don?t eat a lot, I don?t get milk. Now I am thinking I want him to start on formula milk. Please tell me what I should give priority to. My son is 6 months old. 2) what did the breastfeeding sahabia?s do during ramadhaan. Did any miss any fast for the sake of lactation? I am trying to give my son bottle once for the sake of ramadhaan, but I force him and he cries too much. Will this be zulm (torture) in sharia?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Eating less will not reduce your weight. Yes, eating correctly will assist you in losing weight. We suggest you eat well and drink extra liquids for the sake of the baby whilst also attempting to eat foods that are not fattening.\n\n2. If fasting reduces the milk supply and this subsequently deprives the child of nourishment, you may miss out the fasts and cover them up later if the child cannot manage on a bottle, etc.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
