  "answer": "QUESTION\nAlso what is Tera-Tayzee and significance of last Wednesday of this month? I have observed people to do strange things, like tread grass with bare feet and give wheat and eggs as Sadaqa on the morning of the last Wednesday. There also seems to be a connection of this to Rasulullah?s (s.a.w.s) illness. Please explain all the above questions in your response.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Kindly refer below - our standard reply to similar queries.%0D%0A2. Tera Tayzee has no basis in Islam. It is Bi'dat and a major sin.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AQ: There is a general perception that the months of Muharram and Safar have%0D%0Aan evil in them and anything major done in these months, for example,%0D%0Apurchasing a business, house, making Nikah, etc. is unsuccessful. Kindly%0D%0Aexplain if the perception is correct or not according to Shari'ah.%0D%0AA: To regard the Islamic months of Muharram and Safar as 'unlucky' months%0D%0Aand suspend important matters with the fear of them being unsuccessful was%0D%0Athe belief of the pre-Islamic era. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Acondemned this belief. Hadhrat Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, \"There is no bad omen.\"%0D%0A(Mishkat pg.391) In another narration, it is recorded, \"There is no (bad%0D%0Aomen) in (the month of) Safar\". (Ibid)%0D%0ATherefore, one should not suspend any matter in Muharram and Safar with the%0D%0Abelief that they are unlucky months.%0D%0A"
