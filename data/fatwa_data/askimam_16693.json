  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissible to stop talking to members of your family if they are not very practising and they male fun of the beard and the whole of concept of the veil,he also spreads fitnah within our family which causes breaking blood ties\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAt the outset it is important to understand that Islam is a religion of peace and harmony. Islam does not encourage fighting, enmity and hatred. Rather Islam encourages love, affection and healthy family ties.\n\nIn fact Islam encourages us to maintain ties with non muslim family members as well. The mother of Asma bintu Abi Bakr (radiyallaahu anha) was a disbeliever. Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) commanded Asma to maintain ties with her mother. (Bukhari, #2620). When Islam encourages to maintain ties with non muslim family members, then to a greater extent we are required to maintain ties with our muslim family members.\n\nIn the Quran, Allah Ta’ala speaks of the incident of Fir’own who was a tyrant ruler and he disliked Musa (alayhis salaam) and his followers. Allah Ta’ala commanded Musa (alayhis salaam) to invite Fir’own to his worship and advised him to address Fir’own in kind words, perhaps Fir’own may take heed.\n\nIn the light of the Quran and Hadith, we advise you to be diplomatic in your approach. Exercise patience, tolerance and forbearance. Continue carrying out the injunctions of Deen and maintain ties with them. Perhaps they will realize their mistake. Do not severe ties with them. Bear in mind that cutting of conversation will stir up animosity, break up a healthy family relation and will result in a worst situation. Insha Allah, your good akhlaaq will have an impact on him some day.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
