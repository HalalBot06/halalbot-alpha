  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a Muslim and I helped an Indian Intelligence Agency in thier operations, and I was made to think that the India Government truly is honest to muslims and respects them a lot. But off late my eyes are opened and i have seen the true colors of the Indian Government, and so i withdrew my services to them. In my ignorance i have committed some sins like passing on sensitive information pertaining to muslims to them, which they may have used against Muslims, so now how must i repent to Allah. 2) In those days of ignorance i have also visited churches and knelt down before the statue like Nasara i am very sorry for this to Allah, please say me how can i repent for this. I am very misserable for all my activities. As a muslim I would like all muslims to forgive my sins to them, as i think i sinned against the whole Ummah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1.
