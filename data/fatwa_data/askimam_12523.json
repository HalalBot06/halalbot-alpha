  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a female unmarriedmuslim and wear a scarf at all times. I have stopped listening to music, going to the cinema and television for around ayear now in order to become closer to allah, however my question is regarding women and education, I have been accepted onto a course which starts in September and my pure intentions for doing it is because I want to be educated and have a good job at the end of it, it consists all females including the tutors however if I was to make istikarah whether doing this degree is useful for me will it be counted? Seeing that women should be staying at home? Also i`m thinking of wearing a 'jabah', is there any reason to wear 'all black' (such as more sawab is gained etc) also can i do istikarah whether i shud wear one or not due to mixed reactions from the family? Please clarify as soon as you can jazakalah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is permissible for you to attend the course and educate yourself if it is an all female course. Obviously, when you emerge from home, you will have to adhere to the laws of Hijaab.\n\n2. It is not necessary to wear a Jabah specifically and that it must be black. You may wear any outer garment that conceals the form and shape of your body. The colour must also not be attractive. The commonly worn Jabahs serve this purpose well. However, it is not a Shar?ee requirement that a Jabah specifically and that it be black in colour be worn.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
