  "question": "Doing business without knowing the items price",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nNormally a shopkeeper doesn't know whether the amount they receive for their goods is from halaal source or not. so in this case is it permissible for them to do business?\n\nSecondly, if they are sure the product that they are going to sell will be used in a haraam act or business by the buyer. e,g a shopkeeper sells bottles and he knows that a buyer of his will use it to fill it with wine and will sell it further. Will it still be permissible for shopkeeper to sell his bottles/ products to such a buyer?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1.      It is permissible for the shopkeeper to accept payment from the consumer even if the shopkeeper does not know whether the consumer’s payment is from halal source or haram source. The shopkeeper is not even obliged to enquire from the consumer his source of payment.\n\n2.      If an item had dual or multiple purposes, for example bottles, then it is permissible to sell such an item. If the consumer used the item in a sinful cause, he will be responsible for that. The shopkeeper will not be responsible.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
