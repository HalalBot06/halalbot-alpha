  "question": "Q : My Husband has married just to have sex with me and does not give me any other rights. Please let me know what are his duties/responsibilities other than having sex with me.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI?m second wife of my husband. Ever since he has married me, I have been living with my parents as he is not willing to live with me. He lives with his first wife and children. He visits me daily for about an hour to have just sex with me even if I?m not feeling well and leaves. He is never bothered about my health and my sexual satisfactions. He avoids to be seen in public with me. This he has been doing for the last fifteen years. He has transferred all his assets and belongings to his first wife and children. He just gives me a fix monthly amount to meet my personal expenses. There is a great difference in amount he spends on his first wife and me. He has also carried out operation so that I can not get pregnant. When ever I bring up the issue of giving me equal rights, he starts shouting and avoids the issue. As he has transferred all his assets, it is getting difficult for him to provide me my pocket money. When I ask him if God forbid something happens to you how I will survive as he has not made any arrangements, his simple answer is ?May God help you?. At times I have even asked him to give me talaq as I don?t want to live like that to which he avoids the subject. Please advise if he is fulfilling his duties as a husband and is he fair in treating me like that and what is my status as wife. What course of action should I take as I do not wish to remain his wife.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe deeply sympathise with you in your plight.\n\nYou should refer to your local Ulama body and present your case to them with\na request to annul your marriage.
