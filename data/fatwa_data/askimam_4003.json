  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamoalaikum.God will reward you for doing this great service to muslims.Both my husband and i work and our salaries go to a joint account.I do not have access to the account and cannot spend without my husband's permission and knowledge.I need to know that can I spend some amount according to my own will from my salary? Do i need to have his permission to spend the money that I earn? You might tell me that I should not be workng but please answer my question in the light of current circumstances.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari'ah, every individual's wealth is sanctified. That\nincludes complete control over one's wealth. An adult female may use her\nwealth as she wish to within the parameters of Shari'ah.\n\nShe may spend upon herself as well as give charity. The husband has no right\nover the wife's wealth. If he uses his position as a husband to dominate his\nwife and her wealth, he will be sinful.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
