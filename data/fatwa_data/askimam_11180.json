In this also are 2 cases. Firstly, the congregation is about to start and I am standing and such a person steps forward to lead.

One should understanding that studying the Qur?aan without the tutelage of a competent Aalim could be detrimental to one?s Islam, as the Qur?aan is not simple storybook. It is a complex book dealing with every subject of man?s life, containing the ultimate constitution. Furthermore, it is not necessary for you to remember everything you have read, which is practically impossible for most of mankind.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. To perform Salaat behind a Faasiq Imaam is Makrooh-e-Tahrimi and all efforts should be made to change the Imaam. However, if a Faasiq becomes the Imaam, it is better to perform Salaat behind him instead of reading alone. Fisq includes trimming%2Fshaving the beard and wearing one?s pants below the ankles. (Ahsanul Fataawa vol.3 pg.262; HM Saeed)%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, a person who performs Masah over his socks, his Wudhu is not made, thus his Salaat is invalid. Therefore, if one is certain that the Imaam has made Salaat over his socks, it is not permissible to perform Salaat behind him, and the Salaat will not be valid.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
