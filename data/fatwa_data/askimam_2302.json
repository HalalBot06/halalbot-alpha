  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nYou should repent sincerely and seek forgiveness for your sin.\n\nTawbah (repenting) consists of three things: Firstly, one should immediately leave that sin which one was involved in. Secondly, one should be regretful and remorseful over what one did. Thirdly, one should make a firm intention never to go near that sin again.\n\nIt is also commendable to give some charity. May Allah Ta?ala grant you the Tawfeeq to repent sincerely and accept it, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
