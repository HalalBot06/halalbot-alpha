  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu Alaikum Dearest Bhaiya Mufti Saheb, After thanking Allah for all His continual help, I would like to thank all involved with this site. May Allah bless you and your families. My questions are: 1) What the the name Moshik (or Mushiq) Ur-Rahman mean? 2) Is the girl's name Tahmin/Tahmina islamically acceptable, and what does it mean? Jazak-Allahu Khair, Khuda Hafiz.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\n1. Mushik is an Arabic word from the root word 'Shaq' which means to find\nsomeone or something eager or yearning. Mushiq-ur-Rahmaan means who finds\nRahmaan (Allah) eager. We advise that Mushtaq (one who is eager / yearning)\nto be substituted for Mushiq.\n2. Tahmin or Tahmina - we are unable to locate an entry for this word in our\ndictionaries. The closest entry from the same root word is 'Hamna' or\n'Hamnaan' meaning a small tick (used in the Arabic languages as a term of endearment)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
