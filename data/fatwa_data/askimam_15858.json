  "question": "Should Muslims buy these products from me and will Muslims buy these halal / sharia compliant products even though I am not a Muslim?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am a non-Muslim but have an interest in Islam. I am thinking about opening a company to sell financial products (such as mortgages, insurance etc). These products would be halal / sharia compliant. They would be from Islamic Banks.\n\nMy question is this - Should Muslims buy these products from me and will Muslims buy these halal / sharia compliant products even though I am not a Muslim?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe issue of business and economics in Islam is intricate. It requires specialized knowledge and skills. When such products are offered, Muslim public will want to know who is on the Shariah Supervisory Board. If there are famous and known personalities who are experts in the field, the Muslim public will support the product. It is also very important to have a sound mechanism in place to ensure that the rules of Islamic Business and Economics are also implemented. Merely having an Islamically improved product is not sufficient. The implementation of the rules are equally vital.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
