Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'There will be 72 sects in%0D%0Amy Ummah and everyone will be astray but one. Those who are on my path and%0D%0Athe path of my companions.' (Mishkaat). Those who follow the Sunnah of%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) and his companions are the Ahlus%0D%0ASunnah Wal Jama'ah. There are many sects, each one claiming to be on the%0D%0AHaqq and the straight path. The criteria to determine the correct sect is:%0D%0Aa) Adherence to the Qur'aan and Sunnah of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam).%0D%0Ab) To believe in the finality of the Prophethood of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Ac) To have love for every companion of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam)%0D%0Ad) To follow the Shari'ah through the guidance of anyone of the four famous%0D%0AImaams of Fiqh - Imaam Nu'maan ibn Thaabit Abu Hanifa, Imaam Muhammad ibn%0D%0AIdrees Shaaf'ee, Imaam Maaliki and Imaam Ahmad ibn Hambal%0D%0A%0D%0AIn view of the above criteria, Shi'as and Mawdudis, will be excluded as they%0D%0A(in particular - the Ja'faris) discredit the Sahaaba and make derogative%0D%0Aremarks against them. Qadianis will be excluded as their beliefs are%0D%0Acontrary to the Qur'aan and do not believe in the finality of the%0D%0Aprophethood of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). If one follows the%0D%0Aabove mentioned criteria to determine the right sect, he%2Fshe will be guided%0D%0Aand saved from being netted into the wrong sect.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. 'For Muslim males to grow a beard is Waajib (compulsory), and to let it%0D%0Agrow a fist length is Waajib. Without any Shar%E9e reason to cut or shave is%0D%0AHaraam (totally prohibited). He who does so is a Faasiq (sinner) and to%0D%0Ashorten it less than a fist length is Makruh Tahrimi (near Haraam).' Dari%0D%0AAur Ambiyaa Ki Sunnate, Mufti Saeed Palanpuri.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. As Muslims, we are duty bound to dispel any misconceptions of Islam to%0D%0Athe best of our ability according to the means acceptable in Shari'ah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
