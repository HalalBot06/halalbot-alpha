  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease consider my followin long question bacause my question needs explaination. No.1: I divorced my wife by writing the word ?divorce? ONCE in the divorce deed. After a few days I took that document for attestation to a notary public. He asked me to sign on the side of the document so that he can attest my signatures. I did oppose first but signed in the corner with the intention of attestation and sent it to my wife to overseas. No.2: Within 2 ½ months, in the presence of 2 witnesses I wrote a reconciliation note and sent it to my wife. She refused to accept. No.3: After several months I had to appear for my interview for Canadian Immigration. I was told to bring my wife along. Since she refused to come I was to submit a reason for that. I wrote a Separation Deed, pronouncing my wife separated, WITHOUT the intention of 2nd divorce. No.4: After few months, in order to fulfill requirement for my visa I intentionally wrote 2nd divorce deed and sent it to Canadian High Commission. It has been almost 2 years to this 2nd divorce. In this type of situation am I allowed, by Islamic Law, to reconcile after re-marriage May Allah(s.w.a.) give you reward for giving me advice on that.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the details of your question, you had given your wife only one\nTalaaq-e-Raj'ee (revocable divorce) which you revoked within two and half\nmonths.\n\nIf she was still in her Iddat period, then the divorce will be revoked. If\nher Iddat had expired, then the Nikah has terminated. In such a situation, a\nreperformance of Nikah is necessary. The separation deed and the divorce\ndeed during the application for Visa does not constitute Talaaq.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
