  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. If a person (a cook) eats pig, then later tastes some spaghetti, does he render the spaghetti impure, in other words is his saliva impure? 2. If I think or have a feeling something is impure and eat it, but it isn't impure, do I still get the sin on account of my belief or intention? 3. What is your basis for saying metamorphosis makes foor halal? 4.I remember either accidently saying something bad about Rasul Allah and said ya Rasul Allah ighfirli. I said that because I thought you must get the person insulted's forgiveness, and I heard that he hears our salams to him in the tahyat. I realized I did something wrong and made shahadah. And patched it by saying Allah foregive me.Was that shirk and how bad is it's effects? If these are too many questions please answer 1 and 4. Thank you. Jazakum Allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If a person eats pig, his saliva will become impure as the pig is mixed with the saliva.\n\n2. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Actions will be judged by intentions.? (Bukhari)\n\n3. Our very creation as human beings is based on metamorphosis. Our inception was a drop of semen which is impure. Subsequently, our bodies our pure.\n\n4.
