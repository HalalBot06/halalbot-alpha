  "question": "Why is it that in the Indian culture men most always eat before the women?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI feel from a male standpoint, that this is sort of unfair, that the women work soo hard to cook the food and the males eat FIRST. Is this right?, In some instances the good food goes and there is hardly anything left for the females (sometimes). Why is this the way it is? Is it okay if the females eat first? Is there any hadith on this? I am talking about mostly at functions like dawats, or gatherings. Please advise me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shariah, it is not compulsory for females to eat only after\nthe\nmales have eaten.\nThey may eat simultaneously or even before the males. Probably due to the\nfeminine nature of serving, they themselves prefer serving males before\neating themselves.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti E Desai\nFatwa Dept."
