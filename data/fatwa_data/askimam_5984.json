  "question": "Was wondering why only the Middle Eastern Prophets are mentioned by name in the Qurâ€™an. Since we know that prophets were sent to every corner of the world, why were their names not mentioned?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala sent approximately 120 000 prophets to guide mankind. Allah Ta'\nala says, 'From among them, we mentioned some and did not mention others.'\n\nAllah is Hakim (The All-Wise). The wisdom for not mentioning every prophet\nin the Qur'aan is best known by Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
