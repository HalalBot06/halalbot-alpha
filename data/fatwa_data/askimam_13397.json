That is why Islam has\nprescribed regulations about our food and drink. It lays great emphasis on\nour physical as well as moral health, because both of these are equally\nimportant for a healthy society. The abstention from eating pork is one of\nthe steps taken by Islam to practise hygiene and to attain purity of soul.\nIslam, for the cultivation of inner faculties, insists upon the cleanliness\nof body and the purification of soul through Salaat (prayers) Zikr\n(remembrance of Allah) and other devotional duties. Islam teaches us how to\nattain the virtues and how to give up bad habits because both good and bad\ngrow in the man according to his upbringing, education and environment.\nA human being has natural desires: food, sleep and sex being the three\nprimary ones. He has also natural emotions: sorrow, happiness, love, fear,\ndisgust and avarice etc. Islam doesn't recommend the complete abrogation of\nthese impulses but offers a method of controlling them through religious\neducation and discipline.\nThe prohibition of eating pork in Islam is relevant in this context. There\nis a saying in English that \"a man becomes what he eats.\" According to\nphysicians and medical experts, pork is a harmful diet. Consumption of\nswine-flesh creates lowliness in character and destroys moral and spiritual\nfaculties in a man.\n\nBody & Soul\nThe life of a man is a compound of body and soul. Anything, which is harmful\nfor the body, hurts the soul as well. Consumption of swine-flesh reduces the\nfeeling of shame and as such the standard of modesty. Those nations, which\nconsume pork habitually, have a low standard of morality with the result\nthat virginity, chastity and bashfulness are becoming a thing of the past in\nEurope today. The number of unwed mothers is on the increase despite the use\nof pills and other contraceptives.\nAccording to a report, 60 to 70% girls in Sweden become mothers before\nmarriage. The formula of \"skin to skin is no sin\" is having its toll but\nthere is hardly and feeling of shame and remorse over the end-result. Since\nthe European nations have become addicted to wine and pork, sexual freedom\nwith all its attendant evils has got ingrained in their culture.\nConsequently, homosexuality has been legalized by the British Parliament.\nThe Holy Qur'an has prohibited the swine-flesh, hence the Muslims would not\ndare touch it. The Bible has also forbidden swine-flesh, but Christians\ndisregarded this order and started consuming it. The Europeans now proclaim\nthat pork is a very powerful diet, rich in protein. Some of them further\nargue that since there is a great scarcity of food-stuffs in the world and\nswines are available in abundant quantity, they should be consumed in diet\nto overcome the food shortage. If this argument is true, why don't they use\ndog's meat as dogs too are available in plenty? The Europeans perhaps hate\nthe mention of dog's meat in the same way as the Muslims shun pork.\nAnother wrong notion about swine-flesh is that its consumption lengthens\nlife-span, although this is a pure myth and absurdity. On the contrary,\npeople, who abstain from pork and liquor, have a longer span of life. The\nMuslims in Central Asia bear a testimony to this truth.\nHowever, in the consumption of flesh Muslims are required to be selective\nand distinguish between Halaal (Lawful) and Haraam (Unlawful). This step\nleads automatically to the deeper understanding of the need for the\ncultivation of a pure human nature. As blood is virtually our life-stream\nand whatever we consume ultimately affects the blood system, it is,\ntherefore, necessary to exercise choice in the selection of our food and\ndrink as per the requirements of the Shariah.\nThere are certain foods and drinks specified by Allah, and His Messenger\nProphet Muhammad (peace be on him) as forbidden. The prohibition of these\nfoods and drinks is not by any means an arbitrary action or an unwarranted\ndecree of Allah. It is the first and foremost a divine intervention in the\nbest interest of man and for his own benefit.\nThe reasons behind the Divine intervention are numerous. They are of a\nnature intellectual and spiritual, moral and mental, physical and economic.\nAnd the sole purpose is to show man how to develop himself according to an\nupright course of life in order to be a healthy unit in the structure of the\nfamily, then of society and eventually of humanity at large.\nReliable medical doctors and social scientists are able to realize how those\nfoods and drinks forbidden by Islam are harmful and destructive to the human\nspirit and morality as well as to the physique and moral fibre of man and to\nverify the benefits of Islamic legislations on the subjects.\nThe prohibition is based on the aim of the purification of one's nature,\nbecause food, when consumed, doesn't merely enter the stomach and intestines\nand become excreta. It is absorbed and metabolized into the system and\ncirculated to all parts of the human body, including the brain, and this in\nno small way affects man's nature.\nThe pig is naturally lazy and indulgent in sex, it is dirty, greedy and\ngluttonous. It dislikes sunlight and lacks the spirit and will to \"fight.\"\nIt eats almost anything, be it human excreta or anything foul and\nunwholesome. Amongst all animal flesh, pork is the favoured cradle of\nharmful germs. Pork also serves as a carrier of diseases to mankind. It is\nfor this reason that its flesh is not suitable for consumption.\nSome people have argued that the \"modern pig\" reared in farms is given only\nclean foods, therefore, its flesh should be consumable. The answer is that\nyou may feed the pig on clean, wholesome food, but you can't change its\nnature. It is still a pig. A pig is not a plant and you cannot change it by\nbud-grafting.\n\nMedical Reports\nDr. E. Kazim. M.D. in his article \"Medical aspects of forbidden foods in\nIslam\" (July 1981 issue of Muslim Journal has described diseases carried or\ncaused by the flesh of the swine. He writes:\nThe pig is a scavenger. It is an omnivorous animal. It eats everything.\nThere are many disease carried from swine to man, particularly parasite\ninfestations. Lately extensive research has been focused on senility-old age\nis characterized by hardening of inner lining of the blood vessels of the\nheart, brain etc. a process called atheroselerosis. When a clot forms, it\nresults in coronary thrombosis or a heart attack, cerebral thrombosis or\nstroke.\nDifferent dietary factors are responsible for atheroselerosis. Gross\natheroma may be produced in rabbit by feeding it with cholesterol, but when\nyou add lard (derived from hog fat) to the cholesterol, the incidence of\natheroma is increased and thus you would produce coronary thrombosis, and\nmyocardial infraction.\nBesides, lard contains 2800 units of vitamin D per 100 grams and no vitamin\nA at all. Lately vitamin D has been held responsible for atheroma, by\ncausing increased absorption of calcium in the blood vessels. In human\nbeings, serum cholesterol is not dependent on the intake of cholesterol in\nthe diet, but depends upon the proportion of animal fats in the diet, which\nelevate the beta-lipo protein level in the blood. Animal fats contain\nsaturated fatty acids and these saturated fatty acids have been found to be\nas one of the causes of atheroma in man. Medium fat bacon contains 25%\nproteins and 55% fat.\"\nAccording to medical research, the fat content in pork is more than any\nother meat (beef, mutton etc.) and it takes longer to digest. Dr. M Jaffer\nin an article in the Islamic Review (London) of January 1997 issue has\nlisted 16 kinds of harmful germs, which have been discovered in pork in\nmodern researches and the diseases, which could be caused by them. The\nnumber of patients suffering from tapeworm disease is the highest in the\nworld among pork eating nations. Other diseases attributed to pigs are\ncaused by tri-chinelia spirates and intestinal worms occupy first place\namong such nations too.\nDr. Glen Shepherd wrote the following on the dangers of eating pork in\nWashington Post (31 May 1952).\n\"One in six people in USA and Canada have germs in their muscles -\ntrichinosis 8 from eating pork infected with trichina worms. Many people so\ninfected have no symptoms. Most of those, who do have, recover slowly. Some\ndie; some are reduced to permanent invalids. All were careless pork caters\".\nHe continued \"No one is immune from the disease and there is no cure.\nNeither antibiotics nor drugs or vaccines affect these tiny deadly worms.\nPreventing infection is the real answer.\"\nAfter reading the statement of Dr. Shepherd, one can realize that there is\nno real guarantee of safety when eating pork that one would not be affected\nby trichina worm. That is why modern doctors advise three prohibitions\nduring illness: no liquor, no pork and no smoking.\nMuslims follow the divine law which is much higher than the medical advice.\nThe Glorious Qur'an says, \"So eat of the lawful and good food which Allah\nhas provided for you, and thank the bounty of your Lord if it is Him you\nserve. He has forbidden for you only carrion andÂ  blood and swine-flesh and\nthat which has been immolated in the name of any other than Allah; but he\nwho is driven thereto, neither craving nor transgressing, Lo! then Allah is\nForgiving, Merciful.\" (16:114-115)\nThe above is the order from the Creator of the universe and Supreme\nLaw-Giver. All Muslims are under the obligation to obey it. This is a plain\nand straightforward answer to those, who usually ask why Muslims abstain\nfrom eating pork. Nevertheless, there is no sin, if a Muslims is forced by\nfamine or starvation to eat pork in order to save his life.\n\nRashid Shamsi (The Muslim World League Journal, Rajab 1420 - October 1999)"
