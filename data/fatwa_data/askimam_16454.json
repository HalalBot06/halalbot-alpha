  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni am marreid for 5 years we got no kids. my wife is geting treatment from the hospital in oder to get treatment they  need my spum .so they can use my spum to put in my wife. is this ok in islam to do this tretment or is it a sin. also i want to no to go in the bath wit my wif is this a sin.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\n1. The treatment you have explained is known as artificial insemination (AIH). There are two views amongst the Ulama regarding this form of treatment.\n\nThe Ulama that prohibit ‘AIH’ have done so on the following reasons:\n\n·        In the ‘AIH’ treatment, the sperm is acquired by masturbation and exposing the aurah both of which are generally prohibited. In order to treat infertility, one will have to conduct the unlawful act of masturbation. Infertility is not an extreme medical problem that demands relaxation of the law of prohibition.\n\n·        If the sickness is from the side of the wife, then the husband may opt to take a second wife rather than undergoing a treatment that violates many rules of the Shari’a.\n\nThe Ulama that permit ‘AIH’ treatment do so on the following basis:\n\n·        Those who are unable to bear children understand the difficulty and emotional trauma they experience. Masturbation and revealing the awrah in order to obtain the sperm should be viewed contextually.\n\n·        It is permissible to reveal the awrah for circumcision.\n\n·        Masturbation is not a waste of sperm as it is impregnated into the uterus (intrauterine) of the woman.  \n\n·        Masturbation between husband and wife is permissible.\n\nTherefore, masturbation for ‘AIH’ treatment is permissible with the following conditions:\n\n \n\n·        Only the semen of the husband should be used. It will not be permissible to use the semen of a man other than the husband.\n\n·        Both the husband and wife should be treated by doctors of their respective gender. \n\n·        There should be certainty in the sperm being that of the husband and no one else. \n\nBoth views are substantiated. Therefore, we do not regard ‘AIH’ treatment to be haraam. However, it is discouraged.\n\n2. Moral and modesty demands that at least the private parts be covered. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
