  "question": "Can you perform salaat Salaat wearing eyeliner (worn on eyelid) & mascara. I am a Hanafi married to a Shafie. My husband says that I could carry on following the Hanafi Mathhab. Is this fine?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) Does walking outside bareheaded invalidate wudhu if no ghair mahram sees you. 2) After ghusl does washing napaak clothing, bedding etc invalidate ghusl or wudhu? 3) I am a Hanafi married to a Shafie. My husband says that I could carry on following the Hanafi Mathhab. Is this fine? 4) Are you allowed to eat or drink when you are in need of a gusl bath. 5) If I walk barefoot on tiles does it invalidate wudhu?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Sister-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0A1. If the 'eyeliner' and 'Mascara' do not have impure ingredients in them,%0D%0Athe Salaat performed with it will be valid. However, if the 'Mascara' is%0D%0Amade up from substances that prevent the water reaching the eyelashes during%0D%0AWudhu, then the Wudhu will not be valid. (Maraaqiul Falaah pg.56). Washing%0D%0Athe face in Wudhu is the same as in Ghusl.%0D%0A2. Being bareheaded does not invalidate the Wudhu. However, a woman should%0D%0Akeep her hair covered at all times as the angels of mercy feel ashamed to%0D%0Aenter that home where a woman is bareheaded. (Siratul Mustafa vol.1 pg.142;%0D%0ADarul Kutub Deoband)%0D%0A3. Washing impure clothes after Wudhu or Ghusl does not invalidate the Wudhu%0D%0Aor Ghusl.%0D%0A4. A wife may follow her Madhab which is different from the Madhab followed by her husband.%0D%0A5. It is advisable to wash the hands and mouth before eating. (Maraaiqul%0D%0AFalaah pg.47)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
