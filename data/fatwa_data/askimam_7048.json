  "question": "I live in an apt. with thin walls. My friend says i shouldnt play quran because he can hear the recitation in his room and he will be sinning if he didnt pay attention. What should i do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta?ala says in an Aayat of the noble Qur?aan, ?And when the Qur?aan is being recited then listen attentively to it, and be silent so that mercy be shown on you.? (A?araaf Aayat204)\n\nIt is not correct for you to play the Qur?aan in such environment wherein people are involved in other works because this results in disrespect being shown towards Qur?aan. (Ma?ariful Qur?aan part4 pg.164). You should, therefore, play the Qur?aan in such a manner that only you can hear or may be you could possibly make use of earphones.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
