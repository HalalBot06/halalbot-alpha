I want to join your institute on the internet. Can I join it on the internet. If yes than how\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. At the outset, it is important that you make sincere Tawbah and repentance to Allah. You have usurped the property of others which is a heinous crime in Shariah. Nevertheless, if the exact same CDs are available you should buy them and return them to the hiring centre. However, if the CDs are not available you will be responsible to pay the value of them to the shop. You should approach the owner of the shop and explain your situation to him. Request him to overlook your mistake. Turn to Allah in forgiveness and be shameful of your wrong. Inshallah, He will surely forgive you.\n\n2. It is not permissible to play games which contain cartoons and pictures. These games are futile and yield no benefit. Those who play the games tend to neglect their Salaah and other duties that they are required to fulfill.\n\n3. It is permissible to make Qadha of more than one missed Salaah at a time. However, you must make intention that you are performing the last missed (Fajr, Zuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Esha, Witr) Salaah. Whichever Salaah you making you must mentioned it before starting.\n\n4. We are a tertiary Islamic institute based in South Africa. We have students from all around the world who come and seek Islamic knowledge at the institute. We have courses of hifz (memorizing the Quraan) and Alim course of six years. We are considering starting an internet module for learners who are keen on broadening their Islamic knowledge. We will issue a statement on our website once we finalize this consideration.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
