  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nwhat are the signs of the qiyamat which has already been passed and we are in what stage of the signs of the last hour one of my friend says that imam mahdi has already born and big ulema and elders are already start to look out for imam mahdi during the hajj every year is that true, if mumeen come to know that imam mahdi appears what should he and his family do, in terms of where should they go do they have to go to makkah or madina to join imam mahdi what is your understanding and advice for ummath.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThe signs of Qiyamat can be divided into three categories;\n\nThose signs that have elapsed.\nPresently occurring (Minor signs).\nStill to occur (Major signs).\n\nThe signs of Qiyamat that have elapsed are many, of these are;\n\nThe birth and death of Nabi (Sallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). (Jami Al-Sagir, Bukhari)\nThe Muslims conquering Bait Al-Muqadas (in the time of the Sahaba). (Bukhari)\nThe Plague of Unwas (city in Palestine). (Fath Al-Bari)\nFalse Prophets. (Bukhari)\nA Furious fire ignited in Hejaz which reached Basra. (Bukhari)\n\nThe following are minor signs of Qiyamat that are already apparent;\n\nLost of trust (from the hearts of people). (Bukhari)\nLost of ilm and rampant ignorance. (Bukhari)\nWidespread adultery (Zina). (Bukhari)\nInterest (Riba) being widespread. (Tabrani)\nAppearance of musical instruments. (Ibn Majah)\nExtensive use of alcohol. (Muslim)\nCompeting with each other in decorating Masjids. (Ahmad)\nCompeting with each other in building (houses, building etc.) (Bukhari)\nAbundance of killing. (Muslim)\nContrition in/of time. (Bukhari)\nExtensive immorality, break of family relations and evil character among neighbors. (Ahmad)\nThe use of black dye by men. (Ahmad)\nWidespread miserliness. (Tabrani)\nAbundance of earthquakes. (Bukhari)\nExtensive trade/business until a woman would accompany/join her husband in trade and business (Ahmad).\nRemoval of the pious (by Allah Ta’ala). (Ahmad)\nSalam (to say Assalamu Alaykum) will be made by a person only to those whom he knows. (Ahmad)\nIlm (Knowledge) will be sought from young (Asagir). (Jami As-Sagir)\nWomen would be clothed yet naked (due to their style of clothing). (Ahmad)\nPresence of lairs. (Muslim)\nFalse oaths will be taken. (Ahmad)\nThe presence of more women than men. (Bukhari)\nUnexpected and sudden deaths. (Tabrani)\n\n(Ashrat Al-sa’at, Dar Ibn Al-Jawzi)\n\nIt is evident from the above that all the minor signs of the hour are already present and it’s only the major signs of Qiyamat that are awaited. The coming of Imam Mahdi (Rahmatullahi Alayhi) is one of the major signs of Qiyamat. At the time of his appearance it will be known to the Muslims. However the exact time of his appearance is unknown.  At the time of his arrival the Iman of a believer must be very strong in order to face the trials and tribulations that will be apparent at that time. Therefore, it is the duty of every Muslim to prepare spiritually and physically for his death by performing good actions and perchance one witness’s the time of Imam Mahdi (Rahmatullahi Alayhi) he will be spiritually and physically prepared by him having done good actions.\n\nFor more information on this topic the following may be read:\n\nAt the approach of Qiyamah there will be certain tragic incidents which will unfold for example; wide spread ignorance, the common usage of alcohol, the appearance of Imam Mahdi etc.\n\nAbu Huraira (RadiAllahu Anu) narrates that Rasullah (Sallahu Alayhi Wa sallam) is reported to have said; \"When Amanat (trust) is misused then, wait for Qiyamah (Qiyamah is near) someone inquired how will trust be misused! He (Sallahu Alayhi Wa sallam) replied when Command (of affairs) is handed over to the wrong people\". (Fath Al Bari Vol.1.Pg.188, Qadimi Kutub Khana)\n\nAnas (RadiAllahu Anu) narrates that Nabi (Sallahu Alayhi Wa Salam) is reported to have said; \"Verily, amongst the signs of Qiyamah is; Knowledge will be snatched away, ignorance will become wide spread, alcohol will be extensively used and Zina (adultery) will become common\".   (Fath Al Bari Vol.1.Pg.235, Qadimi Kutub Khana)\n\nAbu Musa (RadiAllahu Anu) narrates that Nabi (Sallahu Alayhi Wa Salam) is reported to have said; \"At the approach of Qiyamah knowledge will be uplifted, ignorance will become widespread and Harj (killing) will become rampant\". (Fath Al Bari Vol.13, Pg.16, Qadimi Kutub Khana)\n\nHafiz Ibnu Hajar(Rahmatullahi Alayhi) (died 852 A.H) states under the explanation of the above Hadith and others that \"At the manifestation of Fitan (turmoil, chaos, and corruptions etc.) killing and murder will become rampant then Imam Mahdi will appear and cause peace to prevail. (Fath Al Bari Vol.13, Pg.20, Qadimi Kutub Khana)\n\nNabi (Sallahu Alayhi Wa Salam) is reported to have said; \"If there remain only one day of this world Allah Ta'ala will lengthen that day and send a person from My progeny (who bring peace to the entire world) his name and his father's name will be the same as My name and My father's name. He will liberate the earth with fairness and justice as it was filled before with injustice and oppression\".   (A'wn Al-Ma'bud Vol. 7, Pg. 346, Dar Al-Hadith)\n\nHafiz Ibnu Katheer (Rahmatullahi Alayhi) (died 774 A.H) states Imam Mahdi’s name will be the same as Nabi (Sallahu Alayhi Wa Salam's) name Muhammad and his father's name will be the same as Nabi (Sallahu Alayhi Wa Salam's) father's name Abdullah. (Tafseer Quran Al Azem, Vol.2, Pg.34, Dar Al-Marifah)\n\nAllama Shams Al-Haqq Al-Azem Abadi (Rahmatullahi Alayhi) states in his commentary A'wn Al-M'abud that \"At the end of time a person will appear who will belong to the progeny of Nabi (Sallahu Alayhi Wa Salam) he will assist the Deen of Allah Ta’ala and let justice prevail, the Muslims will accept him as their viceroy and follow his commands, his name will be Mahdi. The appearance of Dajjal and all other signs of Qiyamah will precede his manifestation, until Essa (Alayhi Al-Salam) will descend from the heavens, he will then kill Dajjal and Imam Mahdi will assist him.\"   (A'wn Al-Ma'bud Vol. 7, Pg. 341, Dar Al-Hadith)\n\nUmmu Salamah (Radiallah Anha) reports that Nabi (Sallahu Alayhi Wa Salam) is reported to have said;…………. (Imam Mahdi) will arise from medina fleeing to Makka. The people of Makka will then pledge allegiance to him between Hajar Al-Aswad and Maqamu-Ibrahim (and accept him as their leader). At this time an army from Shaam will be sent to attack him but when they will be at Bayda, which is between Makkah and Madina, they will be swallowed into the ground. The people seeing this (the army being swallowed,  they will confirm him as being  their leader) thereafter the Abdals (those whom Allah Ta'ala will use to uplift his Deen) of Shaam and a group (A'saib) of people from will then approach him and pledge allegiance to him (Imam Mahdi) between Hajar Al-Aswad and Maqamu-Ibrahim. Mean while a person from the Quraysh belonging to the Kalbi tribe will then send an army to attack (Imam Mahdi) and his followers. His (Imam Mahdi's) army will defeat them…. Imam Mahdi will then live among the Muslims for a period of seven years, he will work and establish the sunnah of Nabi (Sallahu Alayhi Wa Salam) (among mankind) and Islam will again be universal. He will thereafter die and the Muslims will perform his janazah.\n\n(A'wn Al-Ma'bud Vol. 7, Pg. 350, Dar Al-Hadith)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
