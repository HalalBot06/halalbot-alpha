  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSomeone came to tell Hadhrat Abu Darda that this house was on fire. Hadhrat%0D%0AAbu Darda (without any concern) replied that this house was certainly not on%0D%0Afire. Allah Ta'ala will never do so, because I have heard from Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) that if a person recites these words in the%0D%0Abeginning of the day, no calamities will befall that person till evening,%0D%0Aand if the person recites these words in the evening, then no calamities%0D%0Awill befall that person till morning.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another tradition, it is stated that calamities will not befall upon%0D%0Ahimself, wife, children and whatever he owns.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Darda said, 'In the morning I had recited these words,%0D%0Atherefore, how can my house be on fire?' he then said to the people, 'Let us%0D%0Ago and see.' Together with the people, they went towards his house. It seen%0D%0Athat his entire street was on fire and the houses all around Hadhrat Abu%0D%0ADarda's were burnt, but, amidst this, his house was safe and sound:%0D%0A%0D%0AAllaahumma anta rabbiy laa ilaaha illaa anta alayka tawakkaltu wa anta%0D%0Arabbul arshil kareem. Maa shaa-allah kaana wamaa lam yasha-a lam yakun. Wa%0D%0Alaa hawla wa laa quwwata illaa billaahil aliyyil adheem. A'alamu annallaaha%0D%0A'alaa kulli shay-in qadeerun, wa anna llaaha qad ahaatwa bikulli shay-in%0D%0Ailmaa. Allaahumma inniy a'oodhu bika min sharri nafsiy wa min sharri kulli%0D%0Adaabbatin anta aakhidhun binaasiyatihaa, inna rabbiy 'alaa siraatin%0D%0Amustaqeem%0D%0ATrans: O Allah! You are my Lord, other than You there is no one worthy of%0D%0Aworship. It is upon You that I have faith and Though art the Lord of the%0D%0AMighty Arsh. Whatever Allah has wished has happened and whatever He has not%0D%0Awished will certainly not happen. Without the assistance of Allah, we cannot%0D%0Asave ourselves from any evil nor we can acquire any good. I am aware that%0D%0AAllah has power over everything and verily the knowledge of Allah encircles%0D%0Aeverything. O Allah! I seek refuge in Thou from the evil of myself and the%0D%0Aevil of the living upon whom Thou have control. Verily, my Lord is on the%0D%0Aright path.
