  "answer": "QUESTION\nUssalaamu alaikum Mufti Sahib, Please inform the ummah, about the evidence for the witr salaah, being declared as wajib amongst the ihnaaf, also please explain the meaning of wajib, It is my understanding, that an wajib act is such, that if missed, it is a sin. Some friends of mine who prescribe to a different madhaab, say that witr is defenetly a sunnah, but we can?t add to deen by our own means, by declaring that it is a sin, which would make it like halal, and haram. Please give full explainations with Quran and Hadith, and the interperation, and explanation of the early scholars. JazakAllahu khairun\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Fuqahaa (jurists) differ in their opinions regarding Witr being Waajib or not. According to Imaam Abu Hanifa (RA), Witr is Waajib based on many Ahaadith. One of them being, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Whosoever does not perform Witr is not among us.? (Mishkaat vol.1; Chapter of Witr)\n\nSuch an admonishment befits omitting a compulsory act. If your friends are Hanafis, they should regard Witr as Waajib. If they are adherents of another Madhab, then don?t impose the Hanafi view on them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
