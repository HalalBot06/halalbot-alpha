  "question": "I have stopped attending the Asr Jamaat at the masjid, because of uncertanity in my mind about difference in Asr salaat times between Hanafi and Shaafiâ€™ee, Maliki, and Hanabali Madhabs.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhile I understand and accept the answers provided, a simple Yes/No would clearify the following question: Can a follower of Hanafi Madhab call adhaan and/or lead Asr salaat according to prayer times of Shaafi?ee, Maliki, or Hanabali Madhab? My main reasons for re-submitting the question are: 1. The Imam of our local Masjid is Hanafi 2. The time of Asr salaat is set according to Shaafi?ee Madhab 3. The Hanafi's & Shaafi?ee's are fairly equal in number 4. We establish Fajar according to Hanafi time, and the rest of the salaats according to Shaafi?ee time At present I have stopped attending the Asr Jamaat at the masjid, because of uncertanity in my mind about difference in Asr salaat times between Hanafi and the Shaafi?ee, Maliki, and Hanabali Madhabs.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is nothing to worry about. You should join the Jamat for Asr Salaat. Even though the Asr Salaat is performed in the Shaafi?ee time and it is led by a Hanafi, the Salaat is valid.
