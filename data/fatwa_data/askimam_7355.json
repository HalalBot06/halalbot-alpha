  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalumu alaikum Mufti. My wife and I wish to name our son \"Raumaan\", a name we found in a book of muslim names written by Mufti Taqi Usmaani's son. The book stated that this was a name of a sahabi (R.A.).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHis original name was Roomaan. He was the freed slave of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) named him ?Safeenah?.\n\nHe had the good fortune of drinking the blood of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), which is pure. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) made special Du?aa for his and his progenies protection from Shaytaan. He was once lost on an island and he came across a lion. He told the lion that he was the freed slave of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), so the lion guided him to the Road.
