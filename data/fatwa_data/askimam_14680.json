  "question": "1. Why do i still sin in Ramadhan if the jinns are chained up?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Why do i still sin in Ramadhan if the jinns are chained up?\n\n2. I read a hadeeth which says a person that commits/adultury in this life will be punished in this life and the next, does this mean the person will only be punished if they do not repent before they die?\n\n3. My understanding from the story of Noah and the ark was all mankind except Noah drowned, so how did mankind continue with no female mate for Noah?\n\n4. If someone backbites you telling lies are you allowed to talk behind that persons back explaining the real truth?\n\n5. Prophet Muhammad (PBUP) was extremely humble and said he hated gold, so why is his grave filled with gold and\nexpensive decorations?\n\n6. I have heard different sahabee stories of how one sahabah read the entire quran in one rakat, and another sahabee led prayer and completed the quran in one rakat which the sahabee complained, my point is how is that possible if it takes us an entire month to complete the quran. Even if the sahabee completed the quran in one rakat and it took him one day, he would have missed is 4 other prayers in the day. So please explain this.\n\n7. Is there anything prophet Muhammad ( PBUP) said to do or say to your parents to satisfy Allah even more?\n\n8. I understand you must repect parents, but if your father everyday asks for money to pay back loans with huge interests should i help or not to give some money?\n\n9. I have missed salat for many years and i it would be very difficult to pray all the salat, could i do tobah or sacrifice something to replace the salat, or do i 100% have to redo the missed salat?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram Brother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\n \n\nA person sins out of his own choice in Ramadaan and out of Ramadaan. A person is not made to sin. Why then should he be punished if he did not have a choice or will? There are two factors that promt an individual to sin, his Nafs (natural instinct) and Shaytaan. Allah has made the month of Ramdaan a means of self-reformation. For that, Shaytaan has been tied up so that a person may refelect upon his Nafs and shortcomings to understand himself and reform. The temptations for sins are reduced in Ramadaan by the Shaytaan being tied up. A person still has his Nafs with him/her.\nIf a person commits adultery and was punished for that. If he/she also sincerely repented for that sin, he/she will not be punished, Inshallah.\nNooh Alayhis Salaam and a group of his sincere followers were with him in the ark. All his followers, males and females survived with Nooh.\nIt is permissible to clarify misconceptions about oneself.\nThe blessed grave (Roza Mubaruk) of Rasulullah (Salallahu Alayhi Wasalam) is simple. The grave does not have gold and expensive decorations on it.\nWe, the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaa’ah believe in miracles (Karaamat). The recitation of the Quran in a short time is a miracle. Allah contracts long hours for whomsoever He wishes. A miracle cannot be measured alongside rules and principles.\nBe obedient and humble to ones parents. Serve them to the best of ones ability and make Dua for them.\nIf you have excess money, you should assist your father to repay his interest loans and relieve him from that burden.\nYou will have to make up (Qadhaa) of all 100% your missed Fardh and Waajib Salaah. There is no other way if your health is good. Bring up the courage and put a system in place to start making up your missed Salaah. Once you commence, Allah will give you the courage, Inshallah.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
