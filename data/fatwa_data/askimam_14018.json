  "question": "Is it true the Khalid Bin Waleed (RA) kept a hair of the prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in his hat",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\n1)  Is it true the Khalid Bin Waleed (RA) kept a hair of the prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in his hat, and that at one time he had lost his hat and he started to worry until he found the hat. Isn't this relying on the Prophets hair and not relying on Allah (swt).\n\n 2)  Does Eid-ul Adha have to be the next day after Hajj, as one maulvi said that it does not have to be and that you can celebrate eid 2 days after Hajj.\n\n3)  Saudi Arabia started fast on Tuesday as did the majority of mosques in England, however the Barelvi's in our community started on Wednesday, Is it permissable for me to start the fast on Wednesday, as the people in my community did and this would also be good for the unity of our community.\n\n4) Did the prophet (PBUH) see Allah when he went on Meraj, and did he do the journey physically or was it a dream. What is the view of Ahle-Sunnat-Wal-Jamaat.\n\n5) I am doing Qazaa for my missed Farz. I do the following Niyaat,\n\nI am praying 85th Qazaa for my 2 rakaat  farz fajr, is this the correct way. Also when I have finished 360 (one year) I start from 1 qazaa again for the next year, is this correct or do I have to do niyaat for 361, 362 and so on. If this is wrong, would I have to repeat all the Qazaa that I have done.\n\n6)  If the imam has started Fajr  salaat, do I join the imam, or do I first read the 2 sunnat rakaats.\n\n7)  What do you read in the DUA when a muslim dies.\n\n8) Could you recommend me a good book in English on Tawheed\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. We are not aware of this. However, if this is proven, it would be regarded as seeking barakah and blessing from the blessed hair of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. That is not contrary to Tawakkul and reliance on Allah.\n\n2. Eid-ul-Adhaa is on the 10 Dhul Hijjah. It is, however, permissible to slaughter animals of Qurbaani on the 11th and 12th of Dhul Hijjah.\n\n3. Refer your query to Hadhrat Mufti Ismail Kaccholvi Saheb at of 71 Fairbank Road, Girlington, Bradford BD8 9JU Telefax: 01274-822538.\n\n4. According to the Ahlus sunnah Wal Jamaa, Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] physically went for Me’raaj to meet Allah Ta’ala. According to some Ulama, Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] did see Allah Ta’ala.\n\n5. It will suffice for you to state that this is my first of the remaining Qadhaa. This will also be convenient for you.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
