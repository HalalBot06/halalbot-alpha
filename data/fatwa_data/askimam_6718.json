  "answer": "QUESTION\nThis device is made by Harf Information Technologies and it displays the quraan in arabic on the display screen, it also features the recitation of the quraan by Sheikh Sudais and Sheikh Shuraim. I want to know what are the merits or benefits of reading the quraan through this device which can be read without wudhu and whether the thawaab gained for reading the quraan via this device is the same as that gained when reading the quraan normally with wudhu?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe device is similar to a tape recorder.\n\nIt may be used to listen and improve one's recitation of the Qur'aan. It is\nnot necessary to have Wudhu for touching the device.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
