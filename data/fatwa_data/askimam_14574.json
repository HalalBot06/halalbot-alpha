  "question": "I am currently engaged to a girl",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am currently engaged to a girl as of last month. The problem is that now that we are engaged my fiance insist that we can kiss and fondle with each other. I think that this is wrong and that I am god fearing and that we should wait the 4 months till we get married. However she has become very upset lately and even has accused me of not being very loving or caring because of this. I have tried to explain it to her but it always comes back the same problem. I am at present very scared to be alone with her and try to avoid it. This just makes her more upset. She has now told me that she wants to reconsider the proposal. I am now scared that the wedding might fall apart and that I might loose her. Also that my mother and family are happy about me getting married and I fear that I might not find or get another oppurtunity. I am scared I might give in to her demands. What can i Do should I rather let things go apart and pray that Allah blessed me and accept my effort.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nThe solution to your problem is very simple, Get married now. In Islam, marriage is a simple matter. Perform the Nikah and both of you will be permissible for each other. She won’t get upset and you wont lose her. Discuss the issue with your seniors and arrange the Nikah as soon as possible.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
