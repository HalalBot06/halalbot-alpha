  "answer": "QUESTION\nHADEETH 21. Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said: \"The worst person on the day of Qiyamah will be the one who reveals the private life of his wife to others.\" (Muslim) In light of this Hadeeth, is it permissible to disclose problems that you're experiencing in marriage (NOT regarding sexual relations) to your mother/elder with intention of seeking advice and finding some comfort in it?Please if possible write me some dua for difficulties in marriage. JazakAllah for your answer!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAll the Ulama and commentators of the Hadith are unanimous that a person can discuss problems that he is experiencing in marriage, only with such persons that can assist him with his plight as mentioned by yourself.\n\nMere mentioning of marital problem to one who can be of no assistance to the problem is Gheebat (backbiting) which is strongly condemned in the Qur?aan. The best recipe for a happy marriage is firm adherence to the Qur?aan and Sunnah coupled with the explanation of the Ulama and complete abstinence from evil and sin. History hasn?t proven any recipe beyond this. However, for extra benefit, recite verse 74 of Surah 25.\n\nNo Du?aa / Qazifa, etc. will produce the desires result if the above advice is not adhered to firmly. May Allah grant love and understanding between the spouses and remove all kinds of difficulties and problems.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
