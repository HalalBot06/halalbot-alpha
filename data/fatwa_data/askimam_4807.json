  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam o Alaikum, I would like to know if one can get married in the month of Moharram or Safar. What is the Islamic ruling on this? Jazakumullah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo refrain from any act, marriage, journey, etc. in some months, Muharram,\nSafar, etc. was a custom of the pre-Islamic era based on suspicion.\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) condemned that by saying, 'Laa\nSafara' (There is no evil in the month of Safar).\n\nThere is no restriction on marrying in any part of the year and neither does\nany part of the year itself has any negative consequences.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
