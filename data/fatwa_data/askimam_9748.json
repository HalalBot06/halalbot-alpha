  "question": "My wifeâ€™s friend is having an affair with another man, outside her marriage. They have 3 children. Should we tell her husband?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy wife?s friend is having an affair with another man, its been going on for years. She just told my wife. My wife tried her best to make her give this adultery, but we are unsuccessful. As a muslim what is our responsibility? should we tell her husband, as she refuses to listen. They have 3 children who are being ignored, as the both parents work. The mother spends most of her spare time on the phone and looking good to impress others. Please help. Jazak-Allah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for consulting the institute regarding the condition of your%0D%0Afriend's marriage at the moment.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou mention that your wife's friend is involved in an adulterous%0D%0Arelationship with another man. You also ask if you should inform her husband%0D%0Aas she has not taken heed to your wife's encouragement to give up this%0D%0Apractice. Both of you have also noticed that their children are being%0D%0Aneglected due to the parents being engrossed in their own activities.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs Muslims, we are commanded to invite to good and to forbid from evil. We%0D%0Ahave a responsibility towards each other and the welfare of each Muslim%0D%0Ashould be our concern. When we see other Muslims heading for disaster, we%0D%0Ashould make an effort to bring it to their attention that they risk failure%0D%0Aand that they are putting their imaan risk too. In this case there are%0D%0Ainnocent children who may also be part of the deception without realising%0D%0Ait. They require the intervention by people who have their welfare at heart.%0D%0A%0D%0AI agree that this is a delicate situation. It may help to speak to the local%0D%0Aimaam or a respected elder and together with that person, approach the%0D%0Ahusband and inform him of what has been personally revealed by his wife%0D%0Aabout her extra marital activities. Insha'allah, he will accept the%0D%0Ainformation and take steps to correct the situation as soon as possible.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala grant you and your wife the ability to be steadfast in%0D%0Ainviting to good and forbidding from evil. Ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A1SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
