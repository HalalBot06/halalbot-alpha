  "question": "If a person joins zuhr salat in the second rakat, then what is the correct way of performing the salat...Also, when we sit in attahiyat position What is the correct way to raise my finger ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf a person joins zuhr salat in the second rakat, then what is the correct way of performing the salat. I have seen people sit in every rakat they pray after that for some reason. Please explain in detail the correct method of performing a sala t which a person joins from the middle.\n\nAlso, when we sit in attahiyat position every body has a different way of raising their finger when they say shahadat. What is the correct way? I raise my finger when i say ashhadu an lailaha illalah and then put it down when i say wa ashhadu anna muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh. Is this method correct.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1) If a person misses 2 rakats of Zuhr Salah behind the Imam, he is called a Masbooq. The masbooq should make up for the 2 missed rakats after the imam completes his salah as follows:\n\n   a.      In the tashahhud of the Imam’s 4th rakat the masbooq will recite only the Attahiyaat. He will not recite Durood e Ibrahim and dua.\n   b.      When the Imam finishes the second salam, then only will the masbooq stand up to make up for the missed rakats. It is a general practice to stand up after the first salam, this is incorrect.\n   c.      The masbooq should recite the Sanaa, Ta’wuz, Bismillah, Surah Fatiha and a sura in the first rakat and Bismillah, Surah Fatiha, and a surah in the second rakat.\n   d.      The masbooq will perform his two missed rakats and then sit down for the tashahud and recite attahiyaat, Durud Ibrahim and dua and complete his Salah by making two salams. He does not sit after each rakat. That is incorrect.\n\n2) In Attahiyaat the index finger will be raised at the “Ashahadu Allah and will be dropped at Ilallah and not at Ashahadu Anna Muhammad. When the finger is raised turn the gaze from between the thighs to the finger and return the gaze to the middle of the thighs after dropping the finger.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
