  "question": "How do i convince my Non Muslim friend that Allah is the Lord?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nI have a non Muslim friend ( strong  Anglican Christian) who I have known for years. I am trying to convince him to convert to Islam.  He DOES accept all my points I have given about Islam and does not challenge me with any of it. For example like how everything is written in the Quran 1400 years ago and science have only recently discovered it to some of the Shariya laws and why they exist... etc.\n\nHowever, what he says is he believes in his God (which is Jesus and it’s the son of God) and he has prayed to him in many occasions when he was in trouble and sickness and he has been saved. So he is asking me if my God does not exist or is wrong God how come every time I needed him he has helped me ??\n\nWhich is a very difficult question to answer for me. Can you help me answer that question.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nGod Almighty is independent. He is self-sufficient. He does not require the help and assistance of anyone. If (as per your belief) Jesus is God, why then he prayed “Ilaa, Ilaa, Li ma Sabachtane” when *he* was on the cross? Who is the “Ilaa, Ilaa” Jesus was referring to? Simply, it was Allah. He is Most Gracious and Most Merciful. He is compassionate. He provides and helps even those who do not believe in Him. If your friend received help and assistance during troubled times, it was the same “Ilaa” (Allah) that assisted him who assisted *Jesus* who was on the cross. Nobody else assisted him. There is only one God and He is Almighty who created us and the universe. We owe our allegiance and loyalties to Him alone.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
