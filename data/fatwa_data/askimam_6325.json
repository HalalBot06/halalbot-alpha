  "question": "Is it the woman right that I have circumcision or is it not possible for her to insist me to do that?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a new convert and i am going marry soon, so may question to you: Is it the woman right that I have circumcision or is it not possible for her to insist me to do that? Because maybe it is not without any risk to do that in the age of 30. Thank u for your answer\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nCircumcision is not the right of a woman to insist. Rather, it is regarded\nas Sunnah-e-Muakkadah. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Five\npractices are the characteristics of Fitrah; circumsicion, shaving the pubic\nhair, clipping the nails and cutting the moustache short.' (Bukhari).\n\nCircumsicion is also regarded as the way of Ambiyaa (Alayhimus salaam), so\nit was not only practiced by Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), but by the\napostles before Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nFrom this, we can deduce it's not a matter of the women insisting but a\nrequirement of the Deen. Also, you can consult your doctor who would explain\nto you that there is no real danger in having the circumsicion done, because\nmany persons had it done at a late age.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
