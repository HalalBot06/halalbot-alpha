  "question": "Moulana Tariq Jamil, says Hazrat Khijir Alaihis-salam is still alive and he will be Shahid by Dajjal....",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMoulana Tariq Jamil, a respected Alim of Dawat-e-Tabligh, says in a lecture the following things:\n\n1. Hazrat Khijir Alaihis-salam is still alive and he will be Shahid by Dajjal.\n2. Hazrat Khijir Alaihis-salam was sent as a prophet with unique feature of having Universal/Worldly knowledge (Qayinati ilm).\n3. Prophet Musa Alaihis-salam was sent to Khijir Alaihis-salam to learn that special knowledge, not the knowledge of Shariah.\n4. Honour of Prophet Musa Alaihis-salam is of much higher level than that of Hazrat Khijir Alaihis-salam.\n\nI would like to know if all these are true what Moulana Tariq Jamil said in his lecture.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1.      There are differences of opinions among the scholars regarding Khidir عليه السلام being alive or not. Some scholars are of the opinion that he is alive while others affirm to his demise. Among those who hold the opinion of him being alive are Imam Nawawi and Hafiz Ibn al-Salah رحمهم الله تعالى.\n\nAt the appearance of Dajjal, Allah Ta’ala will give him certain temporary privileges to test the faith (Iman) of the Muslims. Among these privileges are; he will cut a person into half and again bring him back to life, by the will & power of Allah Ta’ala.\n\nHafiz ibn Hajar   رحمه الله تعالىhas mentioned a hadith narrated by Abd al-Razzack رحمه الله تعالى in his Musannaf wherein he states that the person whom Dajjal will murder and bring back to life (by the will of Allah Ta’ala) will be Khidir عليه السلام.\n\n2.      Hafiz Ibn al-Hajar coute’s Imam Qurtubi رحمه الله تعالى to having said: majority of the scholars have affirmed that Khidir عليه السلام was a Prophet. This is also the view of Ibn A’tiyah al-Bagwi and Ka’ab al-Ahbarرحمهم الله تعالى . However there is a group of scholars, among them Al-Qushayri رحمه الله تعالى who holds the opinion that Khidir عليه السلام was a Wali (a special friend of Allah Ta’ala) and not a prophet.\n\n3.      Musa عليه السلام was once informed by Allah Ta’ala that there is a person at a place where the two seas meet who is more knowledgeable than him, Musa عليه السلام made his way to this person (khidir). When Musa عليه السلام meet Khidir عليه السلام he introduced himself to Khidir عليه السلام with the following words “I have come you to learn from the virtuous knowledge that you possess”.\n\nUpon this Khidir عليه السلام replied to Musa عليه السلام saying “O’ Musa verily I am the possessor of that knowledge which was taught to me by Allah Ta’ala, of which you do not possess”. (Fath al-Bari Vol.6.Pg.534-537 Qadimi Kutub Khana)\n\nIt is clear from the above that Musa عليه السلام went to Khidir عليه السلام to learn from his knowledge and Khidir عليه السلام was the holder of a particular knowledge, which Musa عليه السلام did not possess.\n\n4.      As for the status of Musa, عليه السلام Allah Ta’ala has cited him in the Quran among the five most virtuous & famous Prophets (ulol al-azam) namely Nabi Muhammad, Nooh, Ibrahim, Musa and Esa عليهم السلام. (Therefore his status is superior than that of Khidir عليه السلام)\n\n(Ibn al-Khater Vol.3.Pg.438 Dar al-Mufed)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
