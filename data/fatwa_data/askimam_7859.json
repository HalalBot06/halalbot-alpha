  "answer": "QUESTION\nis it ok to marry a christian girl?what is the ruling of marring a christian girl if she does not want to raise our children as muslims, and if it is not allowed is it ok under these sercumstances to use birth control?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer attached our standard response to a similar query.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn principle, it is permissible for Muslims to marry Ahlul Kitaab. According to the consensus of all the scholars, Ahlul Kitaab refers to Christians and Jews. Therefore, in principle marriage with Jews or Christians is permissible.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, there are two conditions added to this permissibility, a) She must, at least, believe all the basic fundamentals of her religion, e.g. even though she does not practice on her religion, but as long as she believes in it and is not denying any of the fundamental pillars of her religion, b) The woman must be an original Jew%2FChristian, i.e. it should not be such that she was a Muslim and then reverted to Christianity or Judaism. As long as these two conditions are found, the Nikah is intact and correct (Fataawa Mahmoodiya vol.2 pg.159)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe common objection is that in today?s time, women only claim to be Christian. As was discussed in the first condition, as long as the woman believes in her religion, no matter what she does she will still be classified as Ahlul Kitaab, hence, marriage with her is permissible. the Qur?aan itself mentioned the mischief that these people are involved with. In numerous places, Allah Ta?ala informed us that they altered the Tawraat and the Injeel, they ascribed partners to Allah Ta?ala by making Eesa (Alayhis salaam) their Lord. It was regarding the very same people that Allah Ta?ala had permitted marriage with by calling them Ahlul Kitaab. Yes, there are some who claim to be Ahlul Kitaab but in reality, they have no religion at all. They do not believe in the Tawraat and Injeel, neither do they believe in the prophethood of Moosa (Alayhis salaam) and Eesa (Alayhis salaam). Such people do not fall under the Ahlul Kitaab. (Ma?ariful Qur?aan vol.3 pg.48)%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, we must understand that together with it being permissible to marry Ahlul Kitaab, the Fuqahaa have stated that it is Makrooh. This is based on various reasons, the main part of which is the fact that the effects of such a woman, her ways, character, lifestyle, etc. definitely has a detrimental effect on the husband and spoils the children. Therefore, some Fuqahaa have even stated that the Nikah will be Makrooh-e-Tahrimi. (Fataawa Mahmoodiya vol.6 pg.77)%0D%0A%0D%0ANevertheless, as it stands, the Nikah is valid. We suggest that you advise your pen friend to invite his wife towards Islam. maybe he is unable to make his wife understand Islam because he himself is not a practicing Muslim? You should invite him towards Taqwa, piety, sincerity, Sakaat, Dhikr, Qur?aan, etc. so that by virtue of these good actions, he will be able to convince his wife that Islam is the only true religion."
