  "answer": "QUESTION\nBoth times she complains of being hungry and ask me for bread (Roti). Can you kindly interpret. Thanx\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe food in the hereafter life is good deeds and rewards. Your mother is\nhungry of that. We advise you perform some good deeds, for example, perform\nNafl Salaat, Nafl fasts, recite Qur'aan, or give charity with the intention\nof giving the rewards to your mother.\n\nThat should be done as often as possible. Apart from your mother benefiting\nfrom the rewards, you too will benefit, at least, by thinking of the\ndeceased, that will conscientise you of death and making preparation for\nlife after death.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
