  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs-salamu Alaikum, Mufti Sb. Please check this site, http://fatwa-online.com/index.html they have posted some Fatwa about Tableeg Jamat. Ummah will be very much confused if they keep-on-telling this. Plase send them the reply & also please keep me in your du'a. Was-salam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta%E3la states that one reason for this Ummah being titled as the best of Ummah, is the practice of commanding good and preventing evil'.%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) states, 'Whosoever from among you witnesses evil, he should change it with his hands. And if he is unable to do so then he should change it with his tongue. And if he is unable to do so with his tongue, then he should at least consider it to be wrong. And this is the weakest stage of Imaan. (Mishk%E3t)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Nu%FAmaan bin Basheer (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) says that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) gave an example of people sailing on a boat having an upper deck and a lower deck. The people from the lower deck require water and request water from the people of the upper deck. The people from the upper deck refuse water so the people from the lower deck decide to make a hole on the floor of the ship and get water from the sea. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'If the people from the upper deck don't stop the people at the bottom from making a hole, the ship will sink and all the people travelling will drown. (Mishk%E3t vol. 2 p. 436)%0D%0A%0D%0ASimilarly, if people do not prohibit evil and sin in the society, the entire society - innocent and evil - will equally suffer.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) states that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'Command good and prohibit evil or else Allah will send such a punishment that will destroy everyone'. (Ibid).%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above quotations of the Qur%E3n and Ahaadith of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) are clear that commanding good and prohibiting evil is an emphasised injunction of Allah and His Rasul. Every person must carry out this injunction. All the Prophets (%C1layhimus salaam) followed the footsteps of their respective Prophets and after the demise of their Prophet, they carried out the same mission. The Sahaaba of Rasulullah (Radhiallaahu %C1nhum) spent their entire lives in commanding good and prohibiting evil. Since there is no Prophet to come, every Ummati of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) is the deputy of the Prophet and he has to carry on the mission of the Prophet. The people of Tabligh Jamaat sacrifice their time, wealth and comforts to undergo difficulty and hardships to go in the path of Allah - to carry out this Sunnah of the Prophets - commanding good and prohibiting evil.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs far as the Tabligh Jamaat is concerned, it is our humble view that they are acting upon this injunction of Allah Ta%E3la and are fulfilling this obligation of Shari%E1h. the Jamaat advocates strict adherence to the Sunnah and confirnes itself within the ambit of the Shari%E1h. The purpose of any individual taking part in the Noble work of Tabligh is firstly to reform oneself and dutifully save mankind from the fire of hell. The overwhelming success of the Jamaat is mainly because of the manifestation of the six points which involves the purification of the Naffs and the entity of Tawheed.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe word, 'Tashkeel', literally means to form. In the terminology of Tabligh, it means to urge the people to give time, to come out in the path of Allah for self reformation and propagating good for a number of days 3, 7, 40, 4 months, 1 year, etc. The number of days is also not compulsory, it is only recommended just as it is recommended that a person studying first aid, for example, serves one month as practicals. While he will not be an expert in medicine, he will know the basic things to do during an emergency. Similarly, a person going out for 3 days, 40 days, 4 months, etc. does not become an expert on Shari%E1h, but he will learn the basic requirements of Shari%E1h. The more time he gives, the more he will learn and perfect himself. The time frame is not a criteria according to Shari%E1h.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
