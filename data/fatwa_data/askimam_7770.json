  "question": "What are muslims suppose to do then if they are called up to fight for Britain against muslim countrys.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI live in Britain and recently at school the teacher says that if war breaks out everyone has to go and fight even if u don?t believe in what britains fighting for it?s the law.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for any Muslim living in a non-Muslim country to fight for his country if he believes that his country?s involvement in the war is incorrect.\n\nI understand that every citizen in a democratic state has a legitimate right to raise his concerns against any wrong perpetrated by his government. Muslims living in a democratic state should use that privilege to address their concerns. May be, you should enquire from your teacher his or Britains concept of democracy and how will the concept of democracy fit in when one should fight for his country even if it is wrong?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
