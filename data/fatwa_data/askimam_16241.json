  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is karma and are we muslims suppose to believe it?, also when and how is wudhu broken, is broken by bleeding of the lips?, also what is the correct way to pronouce one of allahs names is it wid an -o at the end or not?like ya-khabeero or ya khabeer?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nWe do not know what karma is.\nBleeding from the lips or any external part of the body invalidates Wudhu.\nThe names of Allah Ta’ala could be recited in both ways, with a pesh (Damma) ُ  or without the pesh. Ya-Kabeeru as well as Ya-Kabeer, both are correct.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
