  "answer": "QUESTION\na girl and aboy have done kissing , sucking n see nude noe they are very guilty abt this and wanrt to correct it ; 1) can they marry 2) suggest how they can corect thier mistake (suggest kaffara) Its very important , plz reply soonnn\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It will be permissible for them to marry each other if there are no Shar?i restrictions preventing them from this marriage, rather it would be better if they do so.\n\n2. Firstly they should sincerely repent to the Almighty Allah for their wrongdoing. Secondly, although no particular type or amount of Kaffaarah is specified for this wrongdoing, they should discharge some amount of Sadaqah in expiation for this wrongdoing which will hopefully lighten the load of the sin earned through it.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf\nDARUL IFTA ?
