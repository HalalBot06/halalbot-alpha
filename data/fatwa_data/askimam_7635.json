  "question": "I have a mother, lives by herself and 2 servants, since all of her sons were working outside the city. She just had an operation on breast cancer lately, but sheâ€™s find, lecturing to fill up her time",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nShe?s not fully practicing, 5 time shalat but not punctual. I was thinking to quit my job and find another one in the city where she lives. I don?t think my other brothers would quit their job to accompany her. I think she needs someone taking care of her. On the other hand, I cannot stand to live with her, since we have some differences of opinion regarding some diini matters, e.g. if I went in jama?at for 40D/4M, and I don?t think my wife will be 100% happy. Even though we have many empty rooms upstairs, but we want to have our own life. What do you think?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is of utmost importance to see to the well-being of your parents. Ponder upon their sacrifice in bringing us up from childhood, was it not the sleepless nights they spent because of us?\n\nTherefore, it is our humble opinion that, if possible, you find an alternate job in the city whereby you can take care of your mother. Remember, it is the Du?aas and blessings of the parents that makes one a successful person. Secondly, if you don?t wish to stay with her, you may stay separately but always keep regular check-ups of the well-being of your mother.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
