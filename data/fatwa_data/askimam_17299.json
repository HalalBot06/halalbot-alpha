  "question": "If the husband leaves her for 6 months and does not divorce her, what should she do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nif a  man leaves a woman for 6 monh anddose not divorce her what should the woman do.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n \n\nShe should get the elders of her family or community involved. They should approach the husband and ask him what his intentions are. If he is willing to reconcile with his wife, he should make this clear and fulfill hers rights of maintenance etc. However, if for some reason he does not wish to continue with this marriage, he should rather issue a divorce instead of leaving the woman hanging in suspense. However, divorce is the last option. The ideal is to keep the marriage intact and endeavor to solve the underlying problems.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
