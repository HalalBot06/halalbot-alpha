  "question": "Is it very haram to watch t.v and listen to music.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. According to Shariah, it is not permissible to watch TV due to the many un-Islamic issues in it.\n\n2. It is also prohibited to listen to music. Rasulullah (Salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam) said, There will be a nation from my Ummah who will make music their lot one day while enjoying their music and alcohol they will awake with their faces transformed into swine. In fact, Rasulullah (Salaa Allahu Alayhi wa sallam) said, I was sent to destroy all musical instruments. Instead of music rather listen to the Holy Quran.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
