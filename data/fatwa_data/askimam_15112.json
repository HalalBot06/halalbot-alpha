  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhile doing foreplay,kissing, etc.. is it allowed to say words like these Alhamdulillah, Masha allah, Jazakallah, etc....?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is not appropriate to verbally say the name of Allah when being intimate with one wife. The name of Allah deserves to be uttered with respect and dignity. Uttering the name of Allah, when kissing is against Adab and etiquette.\n\nAnd Allah knows best \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
