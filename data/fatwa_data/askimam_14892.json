  "question": "What I want to do is give the inventory away to poor people for free what I wanted to ask is, what do u advise me on doing with the inventory",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPart 1 of my question is that I work with a company that I had the feeling and to a certain point knew that the inventory of the store was either stolen or has not paid the vendors off. In fact one occasion may Allah forgive, I was sent to pick up inventory from the vendor, which I felt I was responsible of sneaking out products from the vendor which then I realized that I was basically stealing, again may Allah forgive me. Today the company went out of business and the inventory was left to my responsibility. What I want to do is give the inventory away to poor people for free (so Allah may forgive me, and to do the right thing) what I wanted to ask is, what do u advise me on doing with the inventory? Would you advise me on giving it away, but keep in mind that the inventory is not mine and I was given the responsibility to sell it which I don’t feel comfortable, because I know how the inventory was obtained.\n\n \n\n \n\nPart 2 to my question is that, this company which when I started working for, it was fine and everything was halah. During my work period, for one year I was not paid my salary. I spoke to the manager he kept telling me sooner or later he will pay me. One day he told me that when I sell something, take the sales money and start subtracting to what he owes me. Then one day he came to me and wanted to borrow the money that he finally stared to pay me back. One day I have had enough, a friend that works with me told me he was getting paid in full. That got me mad I felt he was taking advantage of me. So I started taking money and subtracting all the money that he owed me. My question is what I have done is it halah or haram. If haram what would you advice me on doing.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nPart 1\n\nA ruling according to Shariah law cannot be made unless the following are made clear:\n\nWas the inventory definitely stolen or is it only assumed to be stolen?\nIf it was stolen, is there knowledge of from where it was stolen?\nIt is mentioned that you were given the responsibility of selling the inventory. Were you supposed to keep the money derived from it, or was it supposed to go back to the company?\n\nOnce these aspects are made clear, a ruling can be made.\n\nPart 2\n\nAs understood from the question, the manager had given permission to deduct the salary from the sales money, so there is no harm in doing so.\nHowever, it is advisable to keep records of the date and the sales from which the money was deducted, to avoid any misunderstanding.\n\n\n\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n\nWassalam\n\n\nMl.
