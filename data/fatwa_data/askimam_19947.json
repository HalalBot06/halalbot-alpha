  "question": "Have I fulfilled my responsibility as a mother?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have always taken my job as mom seriously. I have I believe been a good mother but my son while I was sleeping sneaked out of his window to go out and had bad influences. He seemed fine when he was home and I made sure that he went only to appropriate places with appropriate people but during his secret outings he started taking drugs and doing other haram things. Nwhen I found out I tried to talk to him and show him the right path but he chose to leave. He is only 16 but I no longer can see, speak or raise him. All I can do is pray for him which I do. I feel that I did not do my job even though I tried my best. Will Allah see this as a failure or will the fact that I always taught Islamic morals and followed Islam be enough.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, The Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salaamu `alaykum wa-ramatullahi wa-barakatuh.\n\nSister in Islam,\n\nAlmighty Allah says;\n\n{إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُضِيعُ أَجْرَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ} [التوبة: 120]\n\n“Most certainly Allah does not let the reward of those who do good go to vain”. (Sura Tawba).\n\nYou made an effort to raise your son with Islamic values to the best of your ability. Your efforts are not in vain. You will see the fruits of your efforts In-sha-Allah. May Allah turn the heart and mind of your son and guide him to the correct path.\n\nSister, your son is 16 years old he is passing a phase in life. At that age, feelings and emotions dominate ones rationale. As adults we ought to think beyond feelings and emotions.\n\nDo not leave your son to do as he wishes. Show him love and care and continue giving him advise. You may consider requesting someone who has influence on him to advise him. Adopt all possible means to guide him and also make dua to Allah to put barakah in your efforts. The dua of a mother is definitely accepted.\n\nDo not despair. Allah will grant you relief regarding your son and make him the coolness of your eyes.\n\nAnd Allah Ta`ala Knows Best.\n\nHussein Muhammad.\n\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nArusha, Tanzania\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai."
