  "question": "Is it Halal for me as a Muslim to sell my security product to a bank and finances companies?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy friend and I have discovered a new sensor technology for perverting theft which costs very less and which is safer when compared to the present technology in the market. It is getting good demand also, but the problem is that it is mainly the finance companies and banks who will be using this technology in order to prevent theft in their institutions. So, I would like to know if it is Halal for me as a Muslim to sell my products? As the main market for this would be these finance companies and banks. Please help me.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykumwa-rahmatullāhiwa-barakātuh.\n\nIt is Halal for you to sell your products to the finance companies and banks.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Hussein Issa,\nMozambique\n\n \nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai."
