  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nSalaams, I wanted to ask about cosmetic surgery. I know that it is not allowed to beautify a person. However i dont want it for the intention to beautify i just want my ears to look normal to everyone elses. I worry when i get married it will make everyone see me different.\n\n \n\nsince a young age ive had people irritate me about my ears, im soo self conscious about them that i do not ever show them i began to wear a hijab to cover them and now i where the hijab all the time even in the presence of women, even my mom and sister if i cant cover my ears i would need a hijab in case anyone sees. I dont even look at my ears myself.\n\n \n\nI am considering otoplasty a small op which pins them back, it doesnt reduce the size or anythin it just puts them back so they dont stick out as much. after this i know i will feel normal and have more confidence. But i dont know if Allah will be angry with me and know im getting even more upset because im scared of Allah but i just want this done. I feel so down about this all the time and when i think about it too much i feel like crying i dont know what to do. i think only another person with very prominent sticky out ears would understand. i dont knw. im so confused.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIt is permissible for you to undergo the otoplasty surgery to restore your ears to the normal position.\n\n \n\nإذَا أَرَادَ الرَّجُلُ أَنْ يَقْطَعَ إصْبَعًا زَائِدَةً أَوْ شَيْئًا آخَرَ قَالَ نُصَيْرٌ رَحِمَهُ اللَّهُ تَعَالَى إنْ كَانَ الْغَالِبُ عَلَى مَنْ قَطَعَ مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ الْهَلَاكَ فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَفْعَلُ وَإِنْ كَانَ الْغَالِبُ هُوَ النَّجَاةُ فَهُوَ فِي سَعَةٍ مِنْ ذَلِكَ\n\n \n\n(Al Fataawa Al Aalamgeeriyah V-5,P-360 Rasheediyah)\n\n(Jadeed Fiqhi Masaail V-1,P-328 Naeemiyah)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\nMl.
