  "question": "1)Is the Salah valid is you move your feet about to prevent losing balance while getting up from Sajdah or Ruku? 2) Can one have a different niyah from the Imam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat do you do if you accidentally have a different niyah? E.g. If you make niyah for three rakah witr, and the Imam prays two and then says Salaam and get up to pray one rakah. 3) Can you make niyah to pray Zuhr behind an Imam praying Asr at a Shafi time? 4) When is the middle of the night? Can you calculate it as being 12 hours after the start time for Zuhr? If not then how does one calculate it?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The Salaat of a person is not invalid if he moves his legs out of position due to losing balance, etc. when getting up from Ruku or Sajda.\n\n2. According to the Hanafi Madhab, the Imaam and Muqtadi (follower) must be performing the same Fardh Salaat in order for the Salaat to be valid. If the Imaam is performing Asr Salaat and the Muqtadi Dhuhr Salaat, the Muqtadi?s Salaats is not valid. (Hidaya vol.1 pg.127; Ilmiyah)\n\n3. Refer 2 above\n\n4. The middle of the night will be determined by the time of sunset. Count the number of hours from sunset to sunrise and divide it by two.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
