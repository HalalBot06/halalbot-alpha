  "question": "Should I eat the meat or not? there are always enough halal butcher shops found. the problem is that they cant be trusted! Some shopkeepers have even been caught mixing halal and haraam!",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am nearly 14 years old and I live in London. Now over here in london, Since there are a lot of muslims there are always enough halal butcher shops found. But the problem is that they cant be trusted! Some people only open halal meat shops because there business will run well as lots of muslims will buy of their shop. Some shopkeepers have even been caught mixing halal and haraam! A few months ago i stopped eating meat since i dont trust it anymore. I prayed salat ul istikhaara several times and all the times they all were positve about me not eating. Every time i prayed I had an even stronger feeling that I should not eat the meat. So i have stopped. I have hid this fact from my family though because they believe that the shopkeeper will only get the sin because we buy as halal. I am worried about what my family will think. Who is right here? Me or my family? If i eat the meat (which I am not sure about being halal and it cant be trusted)...will I not get sins for it? What should I do???????Plz reply as soon as possible............\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, if an Aadil person informs you that the meat is Halaal, it is sufficient. You may rely on the information of such a person and eat the meat. An Aadil person is a Muslim who is upright and sensitive to Deen. He is also well aware of the laws of the Shari?ah, and in particular the laws of Halaal and Haraam.\n\nIf there is no substantial reason for you to doubt the information of an Aadil person then your doubt is baseless. Some dealers being caught for contaminating Halaal with Haraam does not mean that all dealers are guilty of that crime.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
