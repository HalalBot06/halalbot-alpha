  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have many gold jewelleries which are all my wedding gifts. I am a housewife and do not have any income of my own. Who will pay my zakat? I am planning to complete my education within a few years and then seek a job. Can I defer my zakat until I get a job?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou should not delay the payment of Zakaat. Is there any guarantee that you will live to see the day when you will be able to pay up all due zakaat. If need be you should sell some of your jewellery to pay zakaat.\n\nOne should not cling onto ones jewellery as if it is one?s life. One should be prepared to part with any item for the sake of gaining Allah Ta?alas pleasure.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
