  "question": "Is there such thing as ‘Jhoot’ – not drinking from the same glass as a non-muslim?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAS, alhumdolillah I converted 2 Islam after marrying my husband. Mashallah we have been blessed with a beautiful daughter and I want 2 raise her with the best of my ability inshallah. When I 1st converted, I was told that I cannot drink from the same glass as my family as they are non muslim (hence do not eat halal etc) & therefore it would b haram 4 me to do this. I have not read any hadith or any other source to verify this. 1) Now that I have a child, I am worried that if she stays at my families home, she may put toys in her mouth that her non muslim cousins have also put in their mouths. I know that I am not supposed 2 break kinship (and don't want 2) but don't also want 2 do something like this that may b haram. I also don't want 2 insist that this is wrong as I have not been able 2 verify it by any authentic source. Would this be bi?dah? Can u pls advise? 2)Also, would it b haram 4r my non-muslim parents 2 kiss my daughter on her lips due 2 this? I am very confused & do not want 2 cause any difficulties 4 the relationship of my daughter and my non-muslim family. My family love us all very much. 3)I know that it is recommended 2 read namaaz on time (as soon as it starts) however, the jamaat times 4 men is slightly later than the actual start of namaaz & yet it is recommended that men read in jamaat - why is jamaat time later & what would have greater benefits? 4) Can u pls tell me a dua 2 bring my family 2 Islam? Thank u 4 your help. May Allah reward u greatly.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is permissible to use the containers and utensils of non-Muslims if they are washed. It is possible that non-Muslims may eat Haraam or drink Haraam. Therefore, it is not permissible to eat or drink from the same utensils as non-Muslim due to contamination with Haraam. The spit and saliva itself of a non-Muslim is not impure. If a non-Muslim drinks water from a utensil, and it is known that he did not drink any intoxicant just before that then it is permissible for a Muslim to drink from the utensil used by a non-Muslim. It is clear from this explanation that your child may play with the toys of their non-Muslim cousins, even if they licked the toy. Similarly, your non-Muslim relatives may also kiss your children. You are correct not to break family ties. That should be used as an opportunity to make da?awah to your non-Muslim relatives.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Congregational (Jamaah) Salaat of men is also during the recommended time. You may also perform your Salaat at that time.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
