  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nA women who is in age of 57 and got divorced. She is still in her iddah. Now she got proposal from other men for marriage. The men who proposed is in hurry because he want to go abroad  so he can not wait until she finished he iddah period. My Question is, is it possible for women to see other men during her iddah period with the intention of marriage.? Kindly advice.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIddah of divorce and death is the right of the previous marriage. Therefore, a woman observing iddah is considered to be married in terms of her not being free to marry another person and in terms of her not being able to propose and accept a marriage proposal.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
