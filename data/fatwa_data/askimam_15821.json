  "question": "Have i committed Shirk?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nI had a question regarding fatwa # 15638. Well my situation is pretty close but a different one. I used to chat a lot and most of the time it used to lead to fitna by talking to opposite sex. I used to talk to a lot of women and they used to ask my origin  and everything to which I would say India. Well India is a house to a lot of religions, so than obviously out of curiousity they would ask what i am ? Like am I a  Hindu? Sikh? Muslim? Etc. out of shame that as a Muslim I am doing this, I would say Hindu and I am being very true and honest with you. Just because I didn’t want to have other Muslims a bad image out of what I was doing, I would say otherwise.  I am as proud to be a Muslim as anyone can be but I don’t want my religion to have a bad name because of my actions. And now i regret what i used to do and everything, so my questions are.\n\n1.       Have I committed shirk?\n2.       Do I have to say the kalimah as if I am converting back?\n3.       Have my past good deeds been wiped off?\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe general ruling regarding the uttering of the words of kufr is that one becomes a kafir by deliberately uttering the words of kufr, whether he intended them in his heart or not. However, if one is compelled to utter the words of kufr under duress or the words of kufr slip out of one’s tongue, then that person will not become a kafir as long as his heart is at peace with Iman.\n\nوالحاصل أن من تكلم بكلمة الكفر هازلا أو لاعبا كفر عند الكل ولا اعتبار باعتقاده كما صرح به قاضي خان في فتاويه ومن تكلم بها مخطئا أو مكرها لا يكفر عند الكل ومن تكلم بها عالما عامدا كفر عند الكل\n\nAl Bahr Al Raiq Vol.5 Pg.125 (Maktabah Rasheediyah)\n\nIn the situation mentioned in the query, you have pronounced the words of kufr deliberately. Although your intention was to safeguard the name of Muslims, the uttering of the words of kufr will still be regarded as forbidden and a grave sin.\n\n \n\nوفي الفتاوى الصغرى الكفر شيء عظيم فلا أجعل المؤمن كافرا متى وجدت رواية أنه لا يكفر ا هـ .\n\nوقال قبله وفي الجامع الأصغر إذا أطلق الرجل كلمة الكفر عمدا لكنه لم يعتقد الكفر قال بعض أصحابنا لا يكفر لأن الكفر يتعلق بالضمير ولم يعقد الضمير على الكفر وقال بعضهم يكفر وهو الصحيح عندي لأنه استخف بدينه ا هـ .\n\nوفي الخلاصة وغيرها إذا كان في المسألة وجوه توجب التكفير ووجه واحد يمنع التكفير فعلى المفتي أن يميل إلى الوجه الذي يمنع التكفير تحسينا للظن بالمسلم\n\nAl Bahr Al Raiq Vol.5 Pg.124 (Maktabah Rasheediyah)\n\nIt is mentioned in Fatawa Raheemiyah that if a Muslim utters the words of kufr in a drama or a play, and the soul purpose of the play was the propagation of Islam, the person will be regarded to have done a sinful act and there is a possibility that the person has left the fold of Islam.\n\nFatawa Raheemiyah Vol.2 Pg.13 (Darul Isha,at)\n\nTherefore, as a matter of precaution it is better to read the Kalimah again and renew your marriage if you are married.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
