  "question": "What is the ruling if at the time of marriage contract the woman was granted power of divorce?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam alaikum! when my husband and i got married, in our contract my parents requested that i be granted power of divorce for my protection, which my husband agreed to. Now, he is being told that because i have the right to divorce in my hands, he has no right to divorce me and that he is less of a man for allowing me to have the right of divorce. This term in arabic is called \"OSMEH\", i am not sure if that is correct or not. This is causing a lot of tension between us. Also can you tell me if it can be reversed and what is the procedure. May Allah guide us and forgive us all. i am really frustrated.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf you were granted the power of divorce, you own this right. However, since\nyou wish to give up this right you may do so either verbally or in writing.\nIt is a simple procedure; You may say to your husband: 'I am returning the\nright of divorce given to me back to you' or any such similar statement.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
