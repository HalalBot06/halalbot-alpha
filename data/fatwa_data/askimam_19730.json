  "question": "How does one practice Islam in outerspace?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nHow can one practice Islam in outer space? How can one find the Qiblah there? How can one determine Eid day there (ie. In outerspace)?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\n \n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\nFrom the very inception of Islam till now, the Ummah has witnessed the changes of nations, cultures and practices. The present conditions are very different from the conditions and circumstances 1400 years ago. The Sahabah knew that there would be changes and developments to come in the future.\n\nNabi salallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam had prophesized the advent of Dajjal (Anti-Christ) to the Sahabah. In this prophecy Nabi salallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam had spoke of a day where one day would equal one year. The Sahabah upon hearing this enquired how Salaah be performed on such a day. Nabi salallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam replied that in such a time they should estimate the time of every salaah.[1]\n\n \n\nAllah Ta῾āla says in the Quran,\n\nوَاللَّهُ خَلَقَكُمْ وَمَا تَعْمَلُونَ\n\n  “Though it is God alone who has created you and all that you do”\n\nالصافات 96\n\nMan is a slave of his demands. He applies his mind and skills and tries to fulfill the demand of the time. “All that you do” in the above verse is general and includes modern inventions. From the carriage to the vehicle, the aircraft to the jet, the telephone to the telefax and now emails and BBM’s.\n\n \n\nThe specifics of modern day inventions were never thought of before. It was generally believed that there would be innovations and inventions. The Shari’ah rulings pertaining to all modern day inventions are to be directed to the Ulama of that time and era who understand the issue and answer accordingly.\n\n \n\nAnother integral element in rulings of Shari’ah is considering the widespread practice of people, known as ‘Urf. One looks at the practice of people in a place to determine a ruling on an issue. This same ruling may not be applicable at the same time for people of another area because of their practice being different. An example of this is the statement, “get out.” In one place “get out” may mean leave the home, but in another it could mean Talaaq.\n\n \n\nWith the coming of different inventions relevant questions would arise pertaining to these inventions and how they may impact the life of man in the light of Shari’ah. In present times many new inventions are existent which perhaps were unimaginable one hundred years ago. From the Ipod to the airplane, every new invention brings many more questions which relate to Deen.\n\n \n\nThe Ulama of every era would use the broader principles of Shari’ah in order to offer solutions in the light of Shari’ah. Today with the advanced technology and inventions of man the Ulama are still busy carrying out this daunting task.\n\n \n\nPresently space is not inhabited by man. When that time comes the circumstances and challenges will be considered and practical solutions offered. It will be an exercise in futility to offer solutions without knowing what the circumstances and challenges would precisely be in those times.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Ali bin Cassim\n\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nLos Angeles, CA (USA)\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net\n\n\n\n\n[1]سنن الترمذي ت شاكر (4/ 511)\n\n قَالَ: «أَرْبَعِينَ يَوْمًا، يَوْمٌ كَسَنَةٍ، وَيَوْمٌ كَشَهْرٍ، وَيَوْمٌ كَجُمُعَةٍ وَسَائِرُ أَيَّامِهِ كَأَيَّامِكُمْ»، قَالَ: قُلْنَا: يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ، أَرَأَيْتَ اليَوْمَ الَّذِي كَالسَّنَةِ أَتَكْفِينَا فِيهِ صَلَاةُ يَوْمٍ؟ قَالَ: «لَا، وَلَكِنْ اقْدُرُوا لَهُ»"
