  "question": "husband refuses to cancel a credit card that his parents use which charges a lot of interest on it. It is not only ruining his credit, but we also have to end up paying interest on it.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nFirst, I wanted to know if it is okay for a wife to pick Islamic ways over her husband.  My husband refuses to cancel a credit card that his parents use which charges a lot of interest on it.  It is not only ruining his credit, but we also have to end up paying interest on it.  I have told him over and over how wrong this is and that I am going to cancel the card, but he gets very upset with me and forbids me from doing this. \nSecond, If his parents do ANYTHING wrong, and even if he knows its wrong, he won't do anything about it.  I have never asked him to disrespect his parents, nor do I disrespect them, but wouldn't it be our islamic obligation to correct them or discuss with them what they have done wrong so it doesn't cause bigger problems (there are MANY situations where they have done wrong things).  If I bring anything like this up with my husband, he gets very upset with me and it is causing MANY problems in our marriage.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to Shariah, it is not permissible to use the credit card facility if you are not sure of paying the account fully by the due date. Interest is expressly prohibited in the Quraan and the evils and harms of interest are grave and serious. Allah wages war against those who are involved in interest.\n\nYou should advise your husband and in laws on the harms of interest with wisdom and diplomacy. You should look for the right opportunity to address the issue. You should not be disrespectful to your husband and to your in laws.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
