  "answer": "QUESTION\nWill the Ghusl be fard (compulsory)if my Gynacologist puts her fingers in my vigina. During my pregnancy visits my doctor is checking by puting her fingers in. Do I have to make Gusal after this to be pure again.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe internal check up by a gynacologist does not invalidate the ghusl. It\ninvalidates only the wudhu.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
