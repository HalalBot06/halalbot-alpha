  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am having problems in my marriage, that is causing great stress not only for my husband but also the rest of our family.  We live in joint family so it's not like we can keep all marriage tension away from the rest of the family members.My husband chats with women on line, sends them his pictures and receives theirs.  He has left messages up where he even made plans to meet them on a date.  When I confronted him he said he never meet them before he just was just saying that to them because it was fun.  He has promised repeadidly that he would not do this more.  He continues to do it.  Of coarse I get upset and feel hurt.  I have even stopped saying anything because it's useless.  He just lies to me and says he will stop and then creates new accounts and continue to do the same thing. He can tell when I'm hurt and upset, and now he even yells at me about being upset.  He said that keeping stuff to myself will end in divorce.  But when I tell him he yells, then apologies and says he won't do it anymore but continues.What should I do.  I don't want a divorce.  I don't want to make him upset with me.  But all of this really hurts and I don't know how to hide how hurt I am.  Please tell me what Prayer I can say to help all of this.  He says if I get upset or saying anything that I am making his life miserable and that I shouldn't even be upset that every guy does this.Please help me I don't want to hurt our children or our family.  I don't purposaly want to upset him.  I just don't know how to not but hurt by all of this.\nThank you for you listening to me.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe sympathise with you. May Allah make it easy for you. You state that your husband is not faithful to you and chats to other women. We suggest that you approach him and ask him what is his reason for doing so. You should ask him, am I not enough for you? Is there anything I am doing that is not according to your taste?\n\n \n\nOnce you ask him that, he will feel secure and know that you are committed to him. You will win his confidence and Insha Allah, he might stop this. Occasionally, prepare something extraordinary for him so that he looks forward to come home. Welcome him with a smile and this could change his attitude.\n\n \n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\nFATWA DEPT."
