  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan women who are on their menstration cycle visit a loved one's grave?  \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nImam Bukhari has recorded a Hadith of Sayyidatuna Umm Atiyya (Radhiallaahu Anha) that she said, 'We were prohibited from following the Janaaza, i.e. until the graveyard.' (Bukhari Hadith No.1278; See Fathul Baari vol.3 pg.187)\n\nAbu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'May Allah Ta'ala curse women who visits the graves.' (Sunan Tirmidhi vol.1 pg.203)\n\nThis Hadith prohibits women from visiting the graveyard.\n\nAbdullah ibn Mas'ood (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'I had prevented you from visiting the grave, (as of now) you all should visit it for it reminds one of the Aakhirat.' (Sahih Muslim)\n\nThis Hadith is general and includes males and females.\n\nIf the laws of the Shariah (Hijaab, intermingling, crying, etc.) are not violated then the prohibition may be set aside based on the above quoted Hadith. If a woman do not adhere to the laws of Hijaab or she does anything contrary to Shari’ah, then it will be prohibited for her to visit the graveyard based on the first Hadith.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
