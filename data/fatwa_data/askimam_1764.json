  "question": "Istikhara. Should a person abstain from a task if he has felt very negative through Istekhara?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAfter following all the requisites for Istikhara and subsequently feeling very negative about an issue, is it possible that a person can still go ahead with the task according to Mashura, or should he completely abstain from the task with or without Mashura? Does Allah (swt) stop a person from doing a task that may be detrimental to a person if he has done Istekhara, or does the person still have to make his own decision of what to do.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe negative feeling due to and after Istikhara is an indication to abstain from the issue. Furthermore, Rasulullah Sallahllahu Alaihi-Wasallam advised, if you are uncertain about an issue, abandon it.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
