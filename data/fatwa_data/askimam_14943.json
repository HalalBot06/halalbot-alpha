  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ncan a person undergo corrective surgery such as teeth implants., breast implants or breast enhancements or nose surgery or any other cosmetic surgery for any reason whatsoever\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAllah Ta’ala is The All Wise and every act of Allah Ta’ala is perfect and full of wisdom.  Allah Ta’ala says in the Holy Qur’an:\n\nفتبارك الله احسن الخالقين\n\nSo, glorious is Allah, the best of creators. (Al-Muminoon 14)\n\n Allah Ta’ala has created mankind in the best of forms.  He says:\n\nوالتين والزيتون ، وطور سينين ، و هذا البلد الامين ، لقد خلقنا الانسان فى احسن تقويم\n\nI swear by the Fig and the Olive, and the Tur, and the mount of Sinia, and by this peaceful city, We have created man in the best of compostion. (Al-Tin 1-4)\n\n  To change the appearance of our bodies is not permissible.  Allah Ta’ala says in the Holy Qur’an:\n\nولاضلنهم و لامنينهم و لامرنهم فليبتكن آذان الانعام و لامرنهم فليغيرن خلق الله و من يتخذ الشيطان وليا منم دون الله فقد خسر خسرانا\n\nمبينا (النساء)\n\nAnd I will lead them astray and I will tempt them with false hopes and give them my order so they shall slit the ears of cattle and I will give them my order so they shall alter the creation of Allah.  And whoever takes the Satan as friend instead of Allah has incurred an obvious loss. (Al-Nisa 119)\n\nThe Mufassireen (Commentators of the Holy Qur’an) have stated that those who change their physical appearance permanently also fall under this ayah.  \n\nIn principle, it is not permissible to undergo cosmetic surgery to change ones appearance. However, the Fuqaha have ruled permissibility under certain circumstances.  The exact reasons of sugery for the enquired cases need to be specified in order to give a ruling. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
