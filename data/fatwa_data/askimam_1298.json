  "question": "Is it true that Allah has fiec three things already in your life. Death, how much money you will have, and who will you marry?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTaqdeer simply means the perfect and absolute knowledge of Allah Ta?ala. He (Allah) Knows ahead of time what every individual will do with his Ikhtiyaar. Not that Allah Ta?ala imposes upon the individual anything against his Ikhtiyaar. Such a belief is erroneous and actually diminishes the very backbone of fibre of Islam which is life after death, Jannah and Jahannum.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
