  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. I saw this dream about 6 years ago but was always afraid to get a full interpretation. In my dream I saw that I opened the front door to my house at fajr time when it was still dark. When I came into the house, I saw a man sitting at the top of the stairs. His face was covered with a shadow and I could only see his body shape. However something whispered into my ear that it was Prophet Ahmad SAW (the name Ahmad was used and not Muhammad SAW). As you can imagine, I was in complete shock and really scared. I ran inside to find my brother watching TV. I tried to tell him that The Prophet (SAW) was upstairs!! I was so shocked I couldn’t. I grabbed him by the hand and talk him outside. My brother saw the Prophet (SAW) and was very happy and said salaam to him and shook his hand. I was unable to see the Prophet (SAW) at this point due to where I was standing. I walk forward and then I saw him. He looked at me and said Assalaamu Alaikum to me! I was so shocked I didn’t even reply! He (SAW) saw I was scared and he put his arm around me and lead me to the kitchen.\n\n\nIn the kitchen all the cooking utensils were being used and food was being cooked. We both sat down in the kitchen floor, and he busied himself by preparing the food. He wrapped a chocolate bar in silver foil whilst talking to me. I can’t remember what the first few words were, but he was very kind and polite. First of all I bent down to kiss his feet , but he just laughed and pulled me up by my shirt so he I coulnd’t kiss his feet. I asked if he could tell me if Allah Ta’ala was pleased with  me and he said “Oh…..bohat!” (“Yes…..very much” in Urdu). I also asked him “Do you like what they did to your masjid?” (in reference to Masjid An Nabawi in this day and age) He replied yes. He was really kind towards me. Always smiling and laughing. Whilst I asked him these questions he continued busying himself around the kitchen looking for items. I picked up one lid from the pot and underneath the lid it had the writing “Muhammad Mufti Salaam”. I don’t know what that is supposed to mean. He also recited an ayah from the Quran to explain something to me. He pointed backwards as he did this (don’t know which ayah). I then looked at him and said to him “Are you really………?” before I could finish he said to me….. “What?.....Muhammad Rasulullah SAW?? Of course!!” (That is the question I had wanted to ask him anyway). Then I don’t remember much after that and then the dream finished. He wore a white jubbah, a lungi underneath, an imamah and he had long hair down to his waist which was coloured in mendhi. He had a very closely trimmed moustache (not shaved). I noticed his beard was very light around the sideburns and cheeks, which was unusual. It was like a ‘suchi’ beard (unshaven from childhood type beard). The dream was quite long and also seemed very real. I had this translated by my local mufti who roughly translated by saying that the light beard could be a sign of weakness in imaan (I have a bad habit of not recting durood as much as I should) in me, my household or locality. He gave me mubarak for seeing the Prophet (SAW) and told me to keep reciting durood. But somethings were not clear, such as the cooking?? I was always scared in case it was something bad, but deep down, I know I was lucky to see such a dream when I was only 20. I would like Mufti Ibrahim Desai to answer this as he has visited our masjid in London in ramadaan 2006 before he went to visit a relative in Croydon and knows personally the imams in my masjid. \n\n \n\n2. I would like some advice on how to remember the Quran better. I have almost finished my hifz (about 10 juzzes to go), but because I work as well sometimes I get tired when I get back. I have an extremely long day. I wake up early to go madressa, then work, and then back to madressa and get tired every day. I still enjoy it, because it is all about sacrifice. But sometimes my recting suffers and memory fades. What is the best way to keep it firm? Any duas? Is it better to finish my hifz before I get married or should I wait until I complete it?\n\n \n\n3. For my final question I would like to know if I am sinful for hurting anyone else’s feelings for not accepting their marriage proposals? My family had a lot of people sending proposals for me, but unfortunately most of them did not work out and the girls involved always hated me for it. Me and my family were never rude at any stage to anyone but its just the way it worked out? Am I sinful for it? It didn’t make me feel good either.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1.      Alhamdulillah, you are fortunate to have such a dream. the issue of cooking etc does not require interpretation. Your shukr to the dream should be in the following. Adhere to the sunnah of Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم). Read more about him and his family and seerat. Send at least 100 to 1000 duroods daily to him. Do not relate this dream to others.\n\n2.      You are making a sacrifice. Continue with that. Inshallah you will complete your hifz one day, Aameen.\n\n3.      You do not have to accept a marriage proposal just to please people. You must be happy and satisfied with your choice. It is incorrect for people sending the proposal to be upset. Nevertheless, that is not your problem. The people sending the proposal should check their intentions.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
