  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAmerican toilets, either they are too dirty or splashed all over, I dont want to sit on them, even after putting the paper disposable seat, 2nd thing, they dont have any water in the toilets.\n\nSo is it okay to urinate in the urinals - what I do is when I go to the restroom, I wet 2-3 tissue-papers and then urinate and then try to thorougly clean with the wet tissues from all side, so that there is no urineÂ  traces / drops remain and then i throw away the tissue paper. Is this okay to do?\n\nI have searched all the forums and nobody has brought up a question like this, even though it is the ONLY way all the american toilets are, no matter its office, or restaurant, airports, or anywhere else (even some halal restaurants dont have water or any lota(jug) which is very sick to me)\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is not permissible for a person to expose his private area to anyone except his wife. This area in a man is from his navel up to his knees. Using the public urinals would entail exposing this area, hence not permissible.\n\nIf the toilet area cannot be cleaned, and the need arises you may relieve yourself inside the toilet without sitting on the pan. You should keep a small bottle of water to use for your Istinja. If bottle is not available wiping with the wet tissue will suffice.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
