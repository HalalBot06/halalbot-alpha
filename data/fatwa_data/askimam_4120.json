  "question": "About the interpretion of dream",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI wanted to ask you about a question i read on ur website. It is very \"awkward\" that you can translate the dream 2 such a level that u can say \"yes\" to \"tell me if the ten years is wat i have to left to live\"(i have pasted the question below) A big problem with this, one cannot have dreams of ALLAH (swt) in any form. Therefore WHOEVER was in the dream of the following bloke, was not ALLAH (swt)...therefore how can you say yes 2 him living 10 more years? it becomes like predicting the future, can u please re-check this question, JazaakAllah kheir. OLD Question: \"I would like you to interpret a dream for me. I had a dream that everyone around me was drowning in the ocean, and I was standind on a board in the middle of everyone with a green plant in my hands. I was telling Allah (SWT), in the dream, that I was not ready to die yet, and Allah (SWT) told me that I have 10 years. Can you please interpret this dream for me and tell me if the ten years is what I have left to live. Jakakum Allah khair.\" Your Answer Was: \"Yes. and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai FATWA DEPT.\"\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou are correct that one cannot have dreams of Allah Ta'ala in any form as\nAllah has no form. We did not ever state that.\n\nWe simply stated a possibility of living for ten years or more upon the\nquestion of the possibility of living more than ten years. Surely, a\npossibility cannot be ruled out.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
