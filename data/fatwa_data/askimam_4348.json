  "question": "Interpretation of dreams",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu-Alaikum Mufti Saheb I have an intepretation of a dream where your assistance is required . I recently dreamt just before Fajr that I and another person entered a musjid which I had never seen before and at the front of the musjid there sat person with his back faced towards us . The musjid was fairly full and the person turned around to look at me . He was an elderly person with a long white beard and a white turban . I mentioned to the person who was with me that that was the person who claimed to be Imam Mahdi and was the false Mahdi . The most significant part of our conversation was that Qiyaamat will only be in a hundred years time . I am aware that only Allah is aware of the exact date of Qiyaamat but could you interpret this dream , especially the first part . Another dream I had was just before sehri in Ramadhaan . I dreamt that I was in the company of a prominent Sheikh who has a large following in South Africa and I was sitting next to him . He was giving me a breakdown of my miserly deeni activities and poor performance of Salaat and tilaawat . I was on the verge of taking allegiance to him and then got up . Please interpret these dreams for me .\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe first dream is an indication of your correct beliefs. It is true that\nonly Allah knows when Qiyamah will come. That is repeatedly expressed in the\nQuraan and Ahaadith.\nThe second dream is a motivation, to strengthen your Aa'mal of salaah and\ntilaawat. Before taking baiat with any person, you should not hasten,\nrather, exercise caution in doing so. Any person having a large following\nshould not be your criterion of choosing a Shaykh.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
