  "question": "what is your comment about my coworker, a very pious and upstanding sister who wears very sparkly nailpolish on her toes? Is this haraam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, it is not permissible for a woman to apply make-up and show her beauty to Ghayr Mahrams (people not prohibited in marriage).\n\nFurthermore, nail polish forms a base on the nails and water cannot penetrate it, thus, Wudhu done with nail polish will not be valid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
