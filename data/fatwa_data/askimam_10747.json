  "question": "Clarification on Question 4359 about praying in short sleeve",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn question 4359, you stated that it is Makrooh to pray in short sleeves. Does this mean that it is Makrooh for both men and women, or is the ruling different for men and women. I thought that the Sattar of a woman is until her wrist bone, and so if her arms are not covered, the Sattar would be exposed and the Salat would not be accepted. Please clarify.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe answer for question 4359 which states it is makrooh to pray in short sleeves, is only in regards to men. The sattar of a women is till wrist bone. If her arms are uncovered, her salaah will be invalid.(Alamghiri vol.1 pg.64 Qadeemi)\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
