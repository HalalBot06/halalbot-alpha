  "question": "q'eabout fasting - 1. By inadvertance I removed a few hairs from my eyebrows while dressing up for work. Then I remebered I was fasting. Does that break my fast?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have a few questions mostly related to fasting in the month of Ramadan. 1. By inadvertance I removed a few hairs from my eyebrows while dressing up for work. Then I remebered I was fasting. Does that break my fast? 2. Can I wear perfume which contains alcohol when I am fasting to go to work if i won't wear the same clothes to perform salaah? 3. Is it permissible to use an eyebrow pencil during fasting(no other makeup is worn)? 4. I once heard that when a boy comes to see a girl for mariage, she can remove her veil so that the boy can look at her face, neck if this will help him take his decision. Is this true? If yes, can I get the exact hadith wordings with reference. 5. I know a very pious lady who colour her hair(same colour as her natural hair, not as fashion like yongsters nowadays) solely because of her husband (she fears of losing him as the latter is not very sincere in their relationship). Is her fast accepted during the months of Ramadan and the Salaah that she performs everyday(including during other months of the Islamic Calendar)?.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is prohibited for females to remove her hairs from her eyebrows. However that does not invalidate the fast.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. It is not permissible for a female to emerge from her home without a necessity acceptable in Shariah. If she emerges from her home, she must cover herself completely and not apply perfume as that will attract ttention of males towards her. How ever if synthetic lcohol is used, that is not impure. The salaat with lothes sprayed with synthetic alcohol will be valid.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. It is not permissible for a female to adorn herself in anyway when emerging from home. That includes using an eyebrow pencil. The beauty of a woman must be restricted only to females or her husband. However using an eyebrow pencil during fasting does not invalidate the fast.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. It is encouraged for boy and girl to look at each other for purpose of marriage. This is mentioned in a hadith. (Mishkat Vol. 1 Chapter of Nikah)%0D%0A%0D%0A5. It is permissible for a woman to dye her hair according to the natural colour of her hair to please her huband if there is a fear of him neglecting her. The fast will be valid. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
