  "answer": "QUESTION\nAre we allowed to trim our sideburns if it is too curly and looks really bad because it gets really curly as long as we don?t trim our beard itselfBeard is supposed to represent Islam, and if the beard looks bad then can we trim it or atleast our sideburns to make look good\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe beard itself starts from the slightly protruding bone close to the ear.\n\nIt is permissible to trim the hair above that bone, but below that bone may only be trimmed to a fist?s length. If it is still too curly, then you can use a hair styling gel, etc. to neaten it. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyah vol.8 pg.294)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
