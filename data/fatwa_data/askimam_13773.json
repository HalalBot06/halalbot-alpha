  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSuicide is haram in islam,i m very well aware of that.But my question is,if a person is striving hard and hard to become one of the people closer and dearest...\n\nto Allah(e.g Wali) but feels that he is not getting it and feeling of hopelessness and fear is overpowering every inch of him,and yet the only purpose,he feels and thinks,of his life is to get in the sight of Allah(I hope u are getting my point)Can a person commit suicide under these conditions since u can very well understand the mental pain a person goes through.Moreover the person do have spiritual guide but because of valid reasons,is unable to have any kind of contact with him.'living' means losing the little iman he already have and he person is afraid to lose the bit he have.Can a person commit suicide under this situation??Will Allah accept him as a muslim(momin) after suicide?? Second question is,does Allah love one person more and the other less,even though both are striving equally according to thier capabilites and circumstances?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. No, even under such oppressively anguishing circumstances, it is Haraam upon him to commit suicide. He should be patient and allow his natural Taqdeer to take its course.\n\n2. Yes, if he does commit suicide, he will still be regarded as a Muslim, albeit a very sinful one.\n\n3. Yes, this is possible. Perhaps one of them is more sincere and devoted than the other. Perhaps one of them has an attribute that is more beloved in the sight of Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
