  "question": "Could you please tell me that if one sells a banned item in your business, in this case a skin lightening cream which is supposed to be only sold under prescription is it allowed in sharia?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'It is not appropriaye for a\nbeliever to place himself in a disgraceful position.'\n\nTo sell banned items is a crime and if one is convicted, he will be\nsubjected to punishment and embarrassment. However, the income from such\nsales will be permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
