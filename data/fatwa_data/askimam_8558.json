  "answer": "QUESTION\n( This text taken from Arabnews Q & A ? who pay`s wife Zakah on 26.04.03) . Jewelry kept for personal use is not liable to zakah. Zakah applies to money that is liable to growth. Jewelry cannot grow, even though the price of gold may go up. Most scholars agree that a woman?s jewelry is exempt from zakah as long as it remains within reasonable means and it is for personal use. Please explain above in the light of Hanfi Fiqh .\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Jurists differ in their opinions regarding Zakaat on women's personal\npure gold and silver jewellery.\n\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, Zakaat is compulsory on a woman's pure gold\nand silver jewellery if it is equivalent or more to the minimum Zakaatable\namount.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
