  "question": "Dear respected Mufti Saheb, my question is on the verse in the Quran which states that we are created in his image?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDoes that mean that we are physically created in his image or is it our spirit that the Quran is talking about?Please give a detailed tafseer of this topic. Jazakallah hu khairan.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, \"Verily Allah Ta'ala created\nAdam (Alayhis salaam) on his image. (Bukhari)\n\nThe above is a hadith and not a verse of the Noble Quran. \"His image\" in the\nhadith refers to the initial image of Adam (Alayhis salaam). As his initial\nexistence was not in the form of conception and birth.\n\nSome Muhadditheen explain \"His image\" as the image of Allah Ta'ala. He\ncreated Adam and mankind with qualities similar to His, for example, seeing,\nhearing, knowledge etc.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti E Desai\nFatwa Dept.\n_________________"
