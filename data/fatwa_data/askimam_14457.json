  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nKindly let me know if a Divorce (Talaaq) given over the phone without any witness is valid or not. Only one talaaq was given over the phone, kindly elaborate and also inform about the iddah period. The Talaaq was given on 21 June 06.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nA Talaaq given on phone will be valid if one is certain that the husband or his duly authorised representative issued the divorce.\n\nThe iddah period is three menstrual cycles if the divorcee experiences menses and she is not conceived. If she does not experience menses, the iddah will be three months. If she is conceived, then the iddah will be till birth.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
