  "question": "Is there a concept in Islam to take a childsâ€™ name or alphabet from the Quran?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen my son was born I wanted to name him Ali but my In-laws wanted to take the name from the Quran. The Scholar they contacted took the following information: My maiden name and date of birth My husbands name and date of birth My new born sons date and time of birth He then told us that the name he had gotten from the Quran was ?Imran Jamal(fathers name) Mustafa (grandfathers name). According to this person Ali was not a good name for my son as ?Ali Jamal Mustafa? did not have any meaning. So my son was named Imran much against my wishes. What I want to know is this method of naming a child correct and was this done in the days of our Prophet (PBUH).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe method of naming a child mentioned in the question should be avoided, because it is not proven by Islamic rules and it did not happen in the days of prophet (Sallallahu Alyhi Wasallam). The parents should jointly choose a nice and meaningful name for their child.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
