  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf a couple gets divorced and they want to remarry, they have to do halaala before getting married again. My question is what if the woman gets pregnant due to intercourse performed during halaala. Who would be the legal father of the child? Whatâ€™s the Shariah ruling on it?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf a husband divorced his wife three times, the wife will have to go through the process of Halaalah if she wishes to reconcile with her ex-husband. The process of Halaalah is a legitimate marriage. If the wife is conceived with the new husband during Halaalah, he (the new husband) will be the father of the child.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
