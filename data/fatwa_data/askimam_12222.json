  "answer": "QUESTION\nI had a question regarding the translation of \"Tanqeed Aur Haqqe Tanqeed.\" Criticism and the right of criticizing by Maulana Yousuf Lidhyanvi about maududi saheb. The question is about the word Ibid. I dont know what this means. It is written after many phrases by maududi sahab pointed out in the article. It seems to be some sort of citation. Also, Do you have more material on this maududi fitna, as people are still enveloped by it. Secondly, i follow the hanafi interpertations strictly, sometimes friends encourage me and debate with me that we should be a hanafi but not very strictly, they say we are strictly Muslims e.g if in summer time, some masjids have early isha(Shafi interpertation) and hanafi's interpertation is that time for isha has not yet started then we(hanafi) can join the namaz wiht jamat. Is this wrong? Thirdly, can i join the witr of masjid-e-haram makkah (although my witr will not be valid in that manner), can i join just for the dua made by imam-e-kabah in witr. Is this practice rigth?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Ibid refers to a previous reference.\n\n2. It is permissible for a Hanafi to perform Esha Salaat according to the Shaafi?ee time as that is also according to some Hanafi jurists.\n\n3. It is permissible to join the Witr of the haram for the du?aa.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
