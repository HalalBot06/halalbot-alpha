You may include a share of Aqeeqa for your child and your late\nfather-in-law in the cow.\n3. The purpose of including a share for Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) is Isaal-e-Sawaab (passing the reward) to him. By that, it is\nhoped the sacrifice will be accepted by Allah Ta'ala with greater honour and\nyielding greater rewards from Allah. That will also make Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) happy, Insha Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
