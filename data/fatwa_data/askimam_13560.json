  "question": "Is there a passage missing from the Quran regarding stoning for adultery.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs there a passage missing from the Quran regarding stoning for adultery. According to Ibn Ishaq' :\n\n\"God sent Muhammad, and sent down the scripture to him. Part of what he sent down was the passage on stoning. Umar says, 'We read it, we were taught it, and we heeded it. The apostle [Muhammad] stoned, and we stoned after him. I fear that in the time to come men will say that they find no mention of stoning in God's book, and thereby go astray in neglecting an ordinance which God has sent down. Verily, stoning in the book of God is a penalty laid on married men and women who commit adultery.\"\n\nToday we read in the Qur'an, sura 24:32 that the penalty for adultery is 100 lashes. Umar said adultery was not only a capital offence, but one which demanded stoning. That verse is now missing from the Qur'an, and that is why Umar raised this issue ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nA passage from the Quran regarding stoning for adultery is not missing; the issues regarding stoning have been mentioned in many authentic Ahadith.\n\nThe verse mentioned in Surah an-Nur has prescribed the way that is flogging for both man and woman with a hundred stripes. That is when the crime is committed by unmarried man and woman, Hazrat Ibn Abbas states:\n\n\"It is prescribed that if the married man and woman commit this crime then they be stoned to death and the punishment for an unmarried person is a hundred stripes.\n\n(Sahih Bukhari, Kita but-Tafsir p. 657)\n\nSayyidna Ubadah Ibn Samit (R.A) narrates that the Holy prophet (S.A.W) said:\n\nHave knowledge from me, have knowledge from me that Allah Ta’ala has prescribed now the ‘way for women’ (that he had promised before), which is for an unmarried man and woman is a hundred stripes and exile for one year, and for a married man and woman it is hundred stripes and stoning. (Ibn Katheer)\n\n(Ma’ariful Qur’an vol.6 p.348 By: Maulana Mufti Muhammad Shafi)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
