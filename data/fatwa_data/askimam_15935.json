  "question": "Has my past good deeds been wiped of?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nRegaring Fatwa #  1582, brother Abu Yahya you didnt answer my last question which was, have my past good deeds been wiped off? I know you dnt know the unknown and Allah is very merciful, but i have heard that if someone becomes a mushrik their past deeds are wipped off. I mean i dnt understand how can something like this ( which i did)  take you towards shirk when your heart is at frim, because i have read that Prophet S.A.W has said (meaning more or less ) that a persons intention is better than his action or deed. So how can my action be the basis for this fatwa and not my intention? I mean i am not saying i did something right, thats the lowest one can get which i did, but i dont even know if i am gonna live until i get an answer from you. What hope should i have when i have a bundle of sins on my left and whateva i had as my good deeds has been wipped off?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh  \n\nFirstly, we would like to clarify that we stated in our previous fatwa, referred to in your query, that you have committed a grave sin and there is a possibility that you have left the fold of Islam. We did not make a decisive ruling that you have left the fold of Islam. It is only as a matter of precaution that we asked you to recite the Kalimah again and renew the marriage.\n\n \n\nSecondly, it is true that intentions are better than actions and actions are based on intentions. However, there are many rulings in Shariah that are based on actions and the intention is not taken into consideration. For example, when one expressly utters the words of talaq to his wife, then talaq will take place, even though his intention was not to give talaq. Similarly, when one utters the words of kufr explicitly, then he has left the fold of Islam (except when one is compelled to utter the words under duress, etc.), even if his intention is not to leave the fold of Islam.\n\n \n\nAs far as wiping off of good deeds is concerned, according to the Hanafi Mazhab, when one leaves the fold of Islam all his past deeds get wiped off. He has to repeat his Hajj even if he has already performed his Hajj.\n\nFatawa Mahmodiyah Vol.2 Pg.577 (Jami’ah Farooqiyah)\n\n \n\nHowever, you should not make it a reason for you to become despondent, as being despondent is from the habit of the non-believers. Allah Ta’ala says in the Holy Quran:\n\n \n\nولا تيئسوا من روح الله إنه لا ييئس من روح الله إلا القوم الكافرون \n\nAnd do not lose hope in the mercy of Allah. In fact, only the infidels lose hope in Allah‘s mercy.\n\n(Verse: 12:87)\n\n \n\nYou should make it a reason to increase your good deeds, repent to Allah Ta’ala sincerely for whatever wrong that has been done and gain closeness to Allah Ta’ala. Allah is All Forgiving and All Merciful, and there is no doubt that Allah Ta’ala will forgive all your sins when you ask for forgiveness with sincerity and remorse. Allah Ta’ala mentions in the Holy Quran:   \n\n \n\nقل يا عبادي الذين أسرفوا على أنفسهم لا تقنطوا من رحمة الله إن الله يغفر الذنوب جميعا إنه هو الغفور الرحيم\n\nSay (on My behalf), ―O servants of Mine who have acted recklessly against their own selves, do not despair of Allah‘s mercy. Surely, Allah will forgive all sins. Surely, He is the One who is the Most-Forgiving, the Very-Merciful.\n\n(Verse: 39:53)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
