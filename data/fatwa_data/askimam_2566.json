  "question": "Is there anything unislamic about being a part of the United States military.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am in the United States Marine Corps and many Muslim brothers try and put me down by questioning who's side am I on because the US is known for causing conflict in Muslim countries. Those are not my intentions of course. I would like to know the Islamic view on this.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBy joining the police force of a Kuffaar state, you will be actively assisting them in enforcing many injust laws.\n\nIt is thus, not permissible for a Muslim to serve in the police force of England.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
