  "question": "I thought Muslims aren't allowed to judge? In this site, it clearly says Imam Komeni was not a Muslim - why judge when Allah is the only one to judge?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow can someone say that a shia is not muslim. Nobody except Allah (SWT) knows anyones intention when they are dying and when they will face their lord. (I am referring to Imam Komeni - you said that he was not a Muslim). Only Allah is to judge who is Muslim or not.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlmighty Allah Ta'ala Himself has given us the Shari'ah as a criteria to\ndetermine the right from wrong. Therefore, we are obliged to judge according\nto the criteria set out by Allah Himself.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
