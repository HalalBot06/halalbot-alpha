  "question": "What exactly is Laghw? merely talking haram e.g. gheebat, Qadhf, lying, slandering, rumour mongering, swearing etc.????",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSomeone told me that laghw is merely talking haram e.g. gheebat, Qadhf, lying, slandering, rumour mongering, swearing etc. He (from Azhar university) explained that speaking about interests is fine; talking about football is fine; joking around is fine even though they have no benefit. My view prior to his explanation was that laghw is plain and simple: a talk without benefit. Please state to what extent he is correct and elaborate on the definition of laghw. Also can you please say the sin for such an action? I apologise if you?ve already answered this question and for inconveniencing your time. Jazakallah Khair. Remember me in your du?aas.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe definition of Laghw is very broad. It includes Lies, sin, Shirk, evil speech, anything without benefit etc.\n\nThus Ulama have mentioned that there are different categories of Laghw, each with a different ruling.\n\nThe Highest type of Laghw (and thus the worst type) is that speech which is sin and disobedience i.e. in addition to it having no deeni benefit, it contains deeni harms. It will be necessary and Fard to stay away from this type of Laghw.\n\nThe lowest stage would be such speech that carries no benefit nor any harm. It would be better to stay away from this type. Many Ayaat of the Quraan and many Ahadith show that a person cannot be a perfect believer until he abstains from this type of Laghw.\n(Ma'ariful Quran Vol. 6 Pg. 296, Ahkaamul Quraan of Jassaas Vol.2 Pg.43)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
