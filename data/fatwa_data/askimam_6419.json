  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have a marriage proposal from a guy through internet matrimonial. After praying isthiharah continuously, my heart feels good about the proposal and accepted it. He proposed only after feeling good about praying isthiharah about me. When he consulted his mum, about this proposal, she is against him marrying a foreigner. I'm so much disheartened cuz this was after long time period that I find someone suitable for marriage and my isthiharah prayers good, before past proposals was all negative. Both of us now are praying continuiing isthiharah prayers and hoping that his mum would give her blessings for he made it clear that he would not proceed without her blessings. Should we accept this \"obstacle\" as an answer from our isthiharah prayers, and go ahead with looking for someone else or should we be patient and continue our prayers and doa, if so for how long.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAttempt in a nice manner to persuade his mother. If she still does not\nagree, then simply abandon your plans and go on with life.\n\nIt would be senseless going into a marriage that does not have the blessings\nof the parents. It would be a lifelong misery.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
