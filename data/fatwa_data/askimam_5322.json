  "question": "First of all what did Prophet (pbuh) mean by 'kitaabat'?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThere is a hadith that says 'dont teach women 'kitaabat'. (Al-Mishkaat and Abu Daud) First of all what did Prophet (pbuh) mean by 'kitaabat'? Is it the compilation of books.I read in the explanation of this Hadith (in the book 'Behnon ki Chaadar' by Abu Talha Muhammad Younis)that it means do not teach your women how to write. So, i'd like to know why he said this when there is another Hadith saying the exact opposite, that 'knowledge is compulsory for every male and female'. So what is the difference between 'Ilm' and 'kitaabat'? Thankyou.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nUnfortunately, we were unable to locate this Hadith in Mishkaat nor in Abu\nDawud. However, in the light of what the masters in Hadith ruled, this\nHadith, 'Do not teach your women kitaabat (writing)' is classified as very\nweak. Such a Hadith cannot be used to prove anything.\n\nHence, it is contradiction of the second Hadith quoted by yourself will not\nbe taken in consideration.
