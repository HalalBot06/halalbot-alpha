  "answer": "QUESTION\ni have read your explanation about having a tatoo being haraam but what abt a temporary one? My husbad wants me to get a temporary tatoo of a butterfly, he would be the only one who would see it . would be something like a sticker, i want to know if this would be permissable?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis would not be permissible.\n\nThe reasons could be many, a) It is still a tattoo, b) It is a picture of an animate object which is been prohibited in Shari?ah, and c) It is a resemblance of the style of Kuffaar.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
