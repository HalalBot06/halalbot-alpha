  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamualaikum Dearest Mufti Sahab, Muhammad (S) prescribed a specific salaat to read Thursday nights for increasing ones memory.I would like to pray this special salaat for increasing my memory to become a hafiz-e-qur?an inshallah.I have read the instructions from the hadith, however I am still a bit unsure on how to pray this memoryPrayer exactly and correctly and I would be extremely grateful if you can explain it to me because you?re highly knowledgeable (masha allah). I understand the readingof the specified surahs in the 1st 4 rakahs however I don't know what to do when I am sitting for Tashahud after the Attahiyyat. Do I halt saying the DuroodE Ibrahim and begin praising allah abundantly by saying subhanallah, alhumdulillah, allahuakbar etc. or how do I praise him abundantly at that time? How do I send blessings on all the prophets as I don't know how to say it in arabic? If you please have the hamds, duroods and Dua's to say for this prayer can you please e-mail the arabic to me? Lastly, there is the final Dua that is providedfor the actual strengthening of the memory. Do I say this Dua' after the Hamd and praise or completely finish the Durood -e-ibrahim and rabbi ja'alnee and then say this Dua' .Also is this salat is to be prayed on Jummarat (U.S.A.Thursdays)?If you can,please explain and clarify my uncertainties in a very simple manner to me so that I may pray this prayer correctly inshallah. Jazakallahu khairan for your time and help.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe performing of this Salaat will be excellent in the last third portion of Lailatul Jumu?ah (U.S.A. Thursday night) and it consists of four Rak?aats. Surah Fatihah should be recited in every Rak?aat. After reciting Surah Fatihah, Surah Yasin should be recited in the first Rak?aat, Surah Dukhaan in the second. Surah Alif - Laam - Meem Sajdah in the third and Surah Mulk in the fourth. In the last sitting the glorification of Almighty Allah should be done after completing At-Tahiyyaat, invoke peace and blessing on Nabi Kareem (S.A.W) and all the prophets and also seek forgiveness for all the Believers and those Muslim who have passed away. If one does not know how to recite these Du?aa and Durood in Arabic he should complete as normal and take assistance from any Kitaab or it can be done in his own language .The actual Du?aa which is for the strengthening of the memory should be recited after Hamd, Durood-e-Ibrahim and Rabbij ?Alnee or one can read it after Salaam. %0D%0A%0D%0ARegarding the Arabic Du?aa you should refer to Hisnul Hasin or Fazaail -e-A?maal, Virtues of the Holy Qur?an, Part 3. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Ashraf%0D%0ADARUL IFTA ?
