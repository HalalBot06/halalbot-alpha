  "question": "Does 'marrying women of the book' refer to the true Christian and Jews and not to those who believe Isa to be the Son of God, correct?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI ask this because there are Muslim men who marry staunch Christians and Jews on this pretext (usually for obtaining passports).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n'And We have made permissible the pure women from the believers and the pure%0D%0Awomen from the people of the Book.' (Maaidah)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above verse is clear that it is permissible for a Muslim male to marry a%0D%0Afemale from the Ahl-ul-Kitaab (Jews%2FChristians).%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Christians during the time of the revelation had the distorted beliefs%0D%0Aof trinity, crucifixion, etc. Despite that, Allah Ta'ala permits marrying a%0D%0AChristian or Jewish female. However, the purpose of marrying such females is%0D%0Atheir apparent adherence to a heavenly revealed book which could be a%0D%0Astepping stone into understanding the true religion (Islam). Understandably%0D%0Aa marriage has influence on a person's thinking and ideology. Since the male%0D%0Ais stronger generally, he would be able to influence his wife into Islam.%0D%0ATherefore, it is not permissible for a Muslim female to marry a Christian or%0D%0AJewish male purchance she will be influenced to leave Islam.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt must be noted that if the Muslim male is weak in his Islam, and there is%0D%0Afear of him being influenced by the Christian%2FJewish wife, it is not%0D%0Apermissible for him to marry her. A Christian%2FJewish woman should not be%0D%0Ajust by registration while not really being a Christian%2FJew.%0D%0A%0D%0AKindly forward to us with your postal address for literature on mutual%0D%0Arights between husband and wife.
