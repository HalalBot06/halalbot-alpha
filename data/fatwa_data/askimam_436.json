  "question": "Can we (Muslims) greet Non-Muslims with our Islamic greeting 'Assalaamu Alaikum'? And vice versa can we answer them?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe word 'Salaam' is a quality of Allah meaning 'Peace'. It is not\npermissible to greet non-Muslims with 'Assalaamu Alaykum'.\n\nIf they greet you with the Salaam, reply with 'Wassalaamu alaa man al-tabaa`\nal-Hudaa' (May peace be upon the guided ones).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
