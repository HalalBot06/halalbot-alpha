  "question": "using musical instruments at any circumstances like islamic songs, non-islamic songs or any other context, is not permissible.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question is about business of my elder brother. He imports musical instruments (various types) and supply those to the shops throughout our country. So far I know using musical instruments at any circumstances like islamic songs, non-islamic songs or any other context, is not permissible. \n\nSo, kindly let us whether selling those is permissible or not. He claims that in some cases music instm. is permitted  to use. I don't know what are those. If there are really any such case plz also let me know. In this regard I like to inform you that, through online I could collect some vedio of one of world renowned islamic intellectual (I don't want to say his name). No doubt the vedio helps to get some important knowledge and also increases the strength of Imaan (more or less). But the fact is- the vedios are full of music. Now, I would like to know are this vedio is one of the such occassions where musics are permissible (that my brother claims)? I'll be really grateful for your ans.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMusic is Haraam and strictly prohibited. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said he is sent to destroy musical instruments. One of the signs of Qiyaamat is the abundance of musical instruments.\n\nIt is not permissible for your brother to deal in musical instruments. The proceeds from the sale of the musical instruments will be Haraam. The claim of your brother that music is permissible in some instances is incorrect.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
