  "question": "North Pole - Salah Timings",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am a student doing Islam at school. I am wondering that if you live in the North Pole, where it is sunny for 24 hours a day for 6 months, do you still have to do all your prayers to Allah?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nYes, even in very extreme latitudes where the sun does not set for months, a Muslim will still perform all 5 prayers every 24 hours.\n\nThe prayer times will be determined according to the nearest place where normal prayer timings occur.  (Shaami vol.1 pg.364) [i]\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\nــــــــــــــــ\n\nفتاوى دار العلوم زكريا، ٢/ ٤٥ [i]"
