  "question": "Is it possible for a woman to get married even if the stubborn husband will not give her Islamic divorce",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like to remarry, I have been separated from my husband for two years and he will not give me Islamic divorce, would it be possible for me to marry someone else in such a circumstance or do I need my husband to divorce me first? How can I make him give me an islamic divorce? he is too stubborn?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou cannot remarry until you obtain a divorce from your husband. The period\nof separation does not constitute a divorce. If your husband is spiteful in\nwithholding the divorce, you may contact your local Ulama Body and request\nthem to obtain the talaaq from him or annul the marriage. They will do so by\nfollowing the Shariah Judicial procedures.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
