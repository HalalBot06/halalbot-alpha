  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. I know a number of woman who are single and looking for spouses. Can you give advice and any type of dua or surah that some may read for this.\n\n2. Is it permissible to write creative stories for children?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nFirstly, they should make Dua to Allah to grant them a pious and suitable spouse. Some Ulama have recommended torecite the following verse as often as possible \"Qaala Rabby inny Lima Anzalta Illyya Min Khairin Faqeer.\n\nIt is permissible to write stories on conditions there are no pictures in the book. Furthermore, the stories should not be tales which have no lesson or moral. Therefore, stories which will serve as a lesson for the children should be considered like the incidents of Sahabah, pious people etc. The style, format and content may however be written to suite the level of small children.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
