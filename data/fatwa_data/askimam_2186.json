  "question": "Is Paradise worth striving for? This question has been posed by some friends.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome of my friends say that in the Prophet's time, there were very few luxuries,so Paradise seemed attractive to them. But nowadays they say there are many luxuries and they say that Paradise is not worth striving for. Dear Mufti Sahab, please refute their claims by providing daleel that Paradise will be better than anything on Earth forever. Jazaak Allah Khair !\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is our belief as Muslims that Almighty Allah Ta'ala sent s to this world%0D%0Ato test our obedience to Him. We also believe in resurrection from the grave%0D%0Aand accountability in the court of Allah Ta'ala. If we are successful in the%0D%0Acourt of Allah, we will be favoured with the Mercy of Allah through His%0D%0Abounties in Jannah (paradise, heaven). If we are unsuccessful, then if Allah%0D%0Awishes He may forgive us or punish us through Jahannum (hell).%0D%0A%0D%0AThe realities of Jannah are beyond our understanding, therefore, Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'The bounties of Jannah have not been%0D%0Aseen by any eye, heard by any ear or have not passed the imagination of any%0D%0Aheart. (Mishkaat).%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) described some bounties of%0D%0AJannah according to our level of understanding. The ground in Jannah will be%0D%0Aof strong musk, thereby giving out the most beautiful scent. (Ibid). The%0D%0Apebbles of Jannah will be of precious pearls and rubies. (Ibid). The bricks%0D%0Aof the palaces in Jannah will be of gold and silver. The cement attaching%0D%0Athe bricks will also be of musk. (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe carpets in the palaces will be as thick as the distance between the%0D%0Askies and the earth. (Ibid) There will be four streams of milk, honey, wine%0D%0Aand crystal clear water. The Jannah of the lowest person will be ten times%0D%0Athis world. (Bukhari).%0D%0A%0D%0ANo person in Jannah will be regarded low, irrespective of his position.%0D%0A(Mishkaat). After having witnessed and enjoyed all the bounties of Jannah,%0D%0AAllah will grant the opportunity to witness His magnificent countenance.%0D%0AEvery dweller of Jannah will be dumb stricken by that view and will%0D%0Acontinuously stare at Allah. (Ibid). According to Imaam Ghazzaaly, a person%0D%0Awill continuously stare for at least 80 million years. Thereafter, that%0D%0Aopportunity will be afforded to individuals according to their closeness and%0D%0Asacrifices they made in this world. Lastly, but not least, Allah will%0D%0Aannounce to His successful servants that He has favoured them with His%0D%0Aeternal pleasure and that He will never be displeased with them. (Ibid).%0D%0AThere would not be any great pleasure in Jannah that being conferred with%0D%0Athe pleasure of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe make Du'aa to Allah to forgive us, our parents, our Asaatidha, our wives%0D%0Aand all our children and the entire Ummah of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) and to favour us with His Jannah, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
