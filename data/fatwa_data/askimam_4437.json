  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy wife was hindu before our nikkah, she is a true muslim now. I want to know wether she can make dua for her parents who r still hindu for their health and well being who are ill to allah. If not then how can i explain her that bcz she have feelings for her parents like we all true muslims have.She has also tried converting them to muslims but unfortunately didnt succeeded. what shall i tell her she understands they r non believers but she says how can she see them bad as they r her parents.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe love for parents is natural and Islam has considered that. If one's\nparents are alive and non-Muslims, it is permissible to make dua for them as\nwell as serve them without compromising one's Islamic values. The situation\nshould be viewed as an opportunity to be kind to them, serve them and wisely\ninvite them to Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
