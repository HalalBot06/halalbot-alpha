  "question": "dream me and my ex-boyfriend all of sudden hugged each other and my ex-boyfriend started reciting Surat Fatiha (over & over again)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI had this dream just a month ago. And in that dream me and my ex-boyfriend all of sudden hugged each other and my ex-boyfriend started reciting Surat Fatiha (over & over again) while I kept thanking Allah. Could this mean he will come back to me? Because i have this strong feeling that inshallah he will. Can you please interpret this dream and kindly tell me what it means. Thank you very much. May God bless you & your family with happiness.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, we wish to advise you that the concept of\nboyfriend/girlfriend has no basis in Shari'ah. It is Haraam (strictly\nprohibited) for any Ghayr Mahram (not prohibited in marriage) male and\nfemale to have any contact with one another before marriage. Such contact is\ntantamount to Zina (adultery) and a major sin.\n\nHowever, if one recites Surah Faatiha in his/her dream, the person will be\nshowered with grace and happiness. The person's Du'aas will also be\naccepted.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
