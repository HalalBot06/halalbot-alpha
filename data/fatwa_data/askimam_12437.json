  "question": "Who has the preference to lead Salaat, a person who knows little Qur’an but has a small beard, or one with no beard but knows a lot more Qur’an?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe one who shaves his beard or trims it shorter than one fist is classified as a Faasiq. The Fuqahaa have stated that it is Makrooh (odious) to perform Salaah behind a Faasiq regardless of the amount of knowledge he possesses. Therefore it would be essential to perform Salaah behind one who has a Shar?i beard even though he is not as well versed in the Qur?an as the one mentioned above.\n(Ad-Durrul Mukhtaar, Vol. 2, Page 298. Ahsanul Fatwa, Vol.3, Page 260)\n\nNote: If the Imam?s beard is small (less than one fist) due to trimming it, than it will be Makrooh to perform Salaah behind him as well.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf\nDARUL IFTA ?
