Fulfil those promises which Allah has ordered you to fulfil whether it%0D%0Amay be to Allah or to fellow human, e.g. if a person promises his friend%0D%0Asomething, then it will be necessary for him to fulfil this promise as long%0D%0Aas it is not regarding any sin. (Ma'ariful Qur'aan part5 pg.383; Deoband)%0D%0A2. Due to haughtiness and pride, do not turn your face away. When meeting or%0D%0Aspeaking with people, do not turn your face away in speech thinking the next%0D%0Aperson to be lower than you. This is a clear sign of pride which is%0D%0Aforbidden in Islam. (Ibid part7 pg.39)%0D%0A3. Do not give so that you may earn more. Do not give a person a gift or do%0D%0Ahim a favour with this intention that tomorrow I will receive something%0D%0Abetter from the gifted person. This is Makrooh and disliked in Islam. (Ibid%0D%0Apart8 pg.612)%0D%0A4. This is with regards to etiquettes of eating. All good in desirable%0D%0Aactions should be done with the right hand.%0D%0A5. If one is blessed with wealth of the world, then he should use it in the%0D%0Acorrect manner. He should show it whether it be in good clothes, good house,%0D%0Agood car, as long as it is within the boundaries of Shari'ah.%0D%0A6. By saying this word which means, 'O my leader' to a Munaafiq, it shows%0D%0Athat the person has respect for a disbeliever which will in turn draw the%0D%0Awrath of Allah. respect here means to hold the person in high esteem.%0D%0A7. Could you please quote reference for this statement.%0D%0A8. For a person to be in the state of Wudhu, he has to be a believer. If a%0D%0Anon-beliver makes Wudhu, it will not be called Wudhu. Like how if a%0D%0Anon-beliver perform Salaat, it will not be called Salaat because of the mere%0D%0Afact that he is a non-believer.%0D%0A9. The decree of a qualified scholar with regards to Deeni or Islamic%0D%0Amatters.%0D%0A10. The tongue although it may be small, can cause more damage than any%0D%0Aother part of the body. For this reason, we are ordered to control our%0D%0Atongues. As much as possible, try to stay at home, this is more for women,%0D%0Athey should not leave the confines of her house except if reallyness.%0D%0AWeeping over one;s sin is very important because 'Every Muslim is a sinner,%0D%0Aand the best of sinners are those who repent.'%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
