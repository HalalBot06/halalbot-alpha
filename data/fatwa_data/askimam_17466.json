It is for this reason Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said “Who ever makes Istighfaar in abundance, Allah will make a way out for him from every difficulty, free him from depression and anxiety and Allah will grant him sustenance from avenues he will not imagine”.\n\nTherefore the depressed person should repent for the past and turn his/her attention to Allah.

Therefore turn to Allah and He will take care of all ones problems and misfortunes.\n\nبِسمِ اللهِ الَّذِى لا الَه الّا هو الرَّحمنُ الرَّحِيم\n\nالَّلهُمَّ اذْهِبْ عَنِّي الْهَمَّ وَ الْحَزْن\n\nBismillah illazi La ilaha illa huwa ar-rahman ur-raheem\n\nAllahumma adh-hib `anni alhamma wal hazn\n\n \n\nPlace right hand on the forehead after Fardh Salah and recite the above supplication.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
