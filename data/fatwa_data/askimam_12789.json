  "question": "Me(20) and my boyfriend(21) have been together for a year & half. I came to realize that what we have been doing is haram, so I asked him maybe we could ask our parentâ€™s approval of marriage.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHe said his parents will not approve of it before he gets a degree. So we decided to stop seeing each other right away. And both have been asking for forgiveness of Allah everyday for the wrongdoing. A while back before we had broken up our relationship, he mentioned my name to his mom. He said he likes me and wishes to marry me someday, and she was ok with it. Recently I also want to ask my parents about him, and I am sure my parents will approve of him also. But if I let my parents know about him now then I know they would want us to atleast be formally engaged (ring exchange) between the two families. Which I think it?s reasonable because my parents are only looking for their daughter?s security. So I let him know that, but he said his parents will not approve of that either before he gets his degree. Do you think that?s right? Shouldn?t they understand that we do love eachother and if they are ok with it then atleast consider the idea of getting engaged? I want to tell my parents about him soon, but he told me not to. Don?t you think I should? We both want our parents to be happy. Please advice us on this matter. (I?m aware of the fact that even we both become engaged, we still cannot have a relationship until we are married, but the engagement will be a promise between the 2 families for future) Is it ok if we don?t talk or see to each other, but everyday we think & dream of being with eachother?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHis excuse on getting a degree first is a lame excuse. He should rather explain the situation clearly to his parents.\n\nYou should also inform your parents. They should in turn liaise with his parents to get you married as soon as possible. Instead of thinking along the lines of a mere engagement, you should focus on getting married. There is nothing preventing you from this but rather feeble excuses.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nchecked & approved by: mUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
