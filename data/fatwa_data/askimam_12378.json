  "question": "Is it ok for a husband and wife to celebrate their wedding anniversary?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it ok for a husband and wife to celebrate their wedding anniversary? My friend told me that celebrating birthdays and anniversaries is haram? I think celebrating birthdays is wrong but why anniversaries?? Can the husband and wife just go out to eat on their anniversary day? Is there any hadith on eating properly? I get annoyed with people when they chew their food with their mouth open, it makes loud noises and when I told them to close their mouth while chewing their food they said they have been doing it since they were kids?.Jazakallah for your time!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Celebrating birthdays and wedding anniversaries have no basis in Islam. they are the customs of the Kuffaar. Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] said, ?That person who imitates a nation is from among them.? The issue is not only about the husband and wife going out to eat on the anniversary, it is also about following the method and ways of the kuffaar which is prohibited.\n\n2. It is against etiquette to eat in a manner that annoys people. If a person has such a habit, he should endervour to change that habit. He should not defend himself as the bad habit will never go away.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
