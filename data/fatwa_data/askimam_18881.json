  "question": "Alhumdulillah grown beard but still my family keeps on taunting me that \"what about the muslims who dont make beard? are they kafirs?\"",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalam ALyukum Mufti sahib I have Alhumdulillah grown beard but still my family keeps on taunting me that \"what about the muslims who dont make beard? are they kafirs?\" becuse i usually quote that One fist length is WAJIB (compulsory)! secondly day before yesterday me friend's Grandfather died, with no obvious reason but \"some strange green lemons thrown by some one into his house\". I observed lemons to some magic-kala jadu one because it had cuts on the top. Is it okay to throw lemons outside house? can we make use of it to trace the wicked one? Mufti sahib what should be done regarding this?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nWe make Du`ā to Allāh Tā’la to grant you steadfastness in your Dīn, and take you from strength to strength in fulfilling the injunctions of Shari`ā.  May Allāh Tā`la grant you and your family the ability to bear patience on the demise of your grandfather. Āmeen.\n\nIt is usual that when a family member tries to bring his life in conformity with noble teachings of the Qurān and Sunnah, then he is mocked and jeered at by his family. This should not deter him from following the injunctions of Dīn. But rather one should remain steadfast and make Du`ā to Allāh Tā`la to guide them to the straight path.  Even the Ambiyā were mocked and jeered at. Allāh Tā`la says in the Holy Qurān consoling Nabī (Sallāllāhu alaīhi wasalam):\n\n“Verily messengers before you were mocked, but those who mocked them were enveloped by that which they used to ridicule”\n\n(Qurān,6:10)\n\n1)       A simple answer that you may render to your family regarding the beard is that a person who breaks the law of Shari’ā is not rendered a Kāfir. This is the view of the Ahlu Sunnah Wa`ljmāh.\n\n(Adurarulmubāha fill Hazri walibāha,Pg.323,Ilmiya Damascus)[1]\n\n (Please refer to Fatwa #18369 on the ASK IMAM site for further clarity on the issue of the beard.)\n\n2)      It would be best to ignore the fact that someone had made Jādu (Black magic) on your grandfather. Entertaining those thought are futile. Shaytān uses such thoughts to create ill-feelings between you and those whom you suspect and we are warned in the Quran of having suspicion.\n\n Almighty Allah says in the Holy Quran:\n\n“Oh those who believe abstain from (negative) assumptions. Indeed some assumption is sin...”\n\n(Surā Hujurāt, Ayāt no. 12)\n\nIn light of the Ayāt, you should not suspect anyone of having anything to do with the demise of your grandfather, nor attempt to trace such a person. Simply dispose of the green lemons, and make Du`ā to Allah Tā`la to protect you and your family from the evil of Sihr (witch craft).\n\nFor protection against Sihr recite the following:\n\n1)      Last two Sura`s of the Qurān (Sūrah Falaq and Sūrah Nās)\n\n2)       Āyātul kursī\n\n3)      Sura Fātiha\n\n \n\nNabī (Sallāllāhu alaihi wasalam) has also taught us to recite the following Du’ā to be saved from all evils:\n\nاعوذ بكلمات الله التامات من شر ما خلق\n\nI seek refuge in the perfect words of Allāh Tā`la from the evil of what he has created.\n\n(Fathul Bārī, Pg.165. Vol. 10, Daru ihyā al Turāth)\n\nWe make Du`ā that Allāh Tā`la grants your grandfather the highest abode in Jannah (Paradise), and fills his Qabr with Nūr. Ameen.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl.
