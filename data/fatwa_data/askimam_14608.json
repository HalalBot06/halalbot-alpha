The intention should be to perform compulsory Taraweeh Salah.\n\n \n\n2)     We are unable to locate the meaning of the name.\n\n \n\n3)     Be tolerant and humble in front of your mother. She will love you over a period of time.\n\n \n\n4)     Life is full of challenges. The adversities experienced by your brother are not necessarily due to some one having done something on him. Your brother should face the challenges of life and with that perform five daily Salah, recite Quran daily and make Dua. Never lose courage. Allah will always change the adverse conditions to favorable conditions. Insha Allah.\n\n \n\n5)       Try your level best to get as close as possible to Allah in Ramadhan.\n\n \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
