  "question": "Question regarding Salaam when entering the mosque.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaam u Alaikum Mufti Sahib. Over here many people insist that we say Salaam loudly when we enter the masjid and state hadiths to prove it. Also they say we must return the salaam even if we are praying by raising the hand. Can you please explain how we can say that these hadiths of Rasool Allah SalAllahu Alaihi Wassalam were from t he early stages of Islam. Are there any books or references that we can look up which explain this in detail.( Arabic, Urdu or English)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, it is Makrooh (abhorrent) to reply to the%0D%0ASalaam in Salaat by raising one's hands. (Raddul Mukhtaar vol.1 pg.616; HM%0D%0ASaeed, Tahtaawi pg.192)%0D%0A%0D%0ASome Ulama were of the opinion that it is not Makrooh to do so. The Hadith%0D%0Awhich forms as the basis for their ruling is recorded in Sahih Bukhari%0D%0A(vol.1 pg.162) and Sahih Muslim vol.1 pg.204 as well as other books of%0D%0AHadith. Sayyiduna Jaabir (Radhiallaahu Anhu) states that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) once sent me on an errand and when I returned,%0D%0Ahe was performing Salaat on his donkey, so I made Salaam to him but he did%0D%0Anot reply. Then when he completed he turned to me and said, 'The fact that I%0D%0Awas in Salaat prevented me from answering to you.' (Sahih Muslim vol.1%0D%0Apg.204 and Sahih Bukhari vol.1 pg.162)%0D%0A%0D%0AAccording to one narration of Sahih Muslim, Sayyiduna Jaabir (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhu) states that after he made salaam, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) beckoned to me with his hand and at the end of his Salaat, he%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) mentioned to him the above mentioned reasons%0D%0Afor which he did not reply.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis is one of the Ahaadith that forms as the proof for the view of the%0D%0Asecond group of scholars (those that believe it proper to beckon in Salaat).%0D%0AHowever, a close study of the above mentioned Ahaadith will reveal that the%0D%0Areason for which Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) beckoned to Jaabir%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhu) was not to reply to his salaam, instead it was to inform%0D%0Ahim that he was in Salaat and to stop him from repeating the salaam. That is%0D%0Awhy Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) then reasoned with him after%0D%0Athe completion of his Salaat. And Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Ahimself confessed that he did not reply and then explained the reason for%0D%0Athat.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn fact, a more clear description is given in the Hadith of Sayyiduna%0D%0AAbdullah ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) recorded in Sunan Abu Dawud that when%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), while in a similar situation,%0D%0Abeckoned to those who made salaam to him his hand was such that the palm was%0D%0Afacing the ground and the back of the palm facing upwards. (Sunan Abu Dawud%0D%0Avol.1 pg.133). This mode of of beckoning is clearly not that of one who%0D%0Aintends to reply to someone's greeting. In fact, it emphasizes the%0D%0Aexplanation given above that this was to stop them from repeating the salaam%0D%0Aand to inform them that he was still in Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn one tradition recorded by Imaam Bukhari (RA) and Imaam Muslim (RA),%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Verily in Salaat is%0D%0Apreoccupation', i.e. one cannot disrupt his Salaat for the reply to the%0D%0Asalaam. This was said by Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) to%0D%0ASayyiduna Abdullah ibn Mas'ood (Radhiallaahu Anhu) when he made salaam while%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was in Salaat and Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) did not reply nor beckon to him in any way.%0D%0A(Bukhari vol.1 pg.162; Muslim vol.1 pg.204)%0D%0A%0D%0AFor further detailed explanation, we refer you to the Kitaab 'Shar Ma'aani%0D%0Aal-Aathaar' of Imaam Tahaawi vol.1 pgs.296 - 298%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
