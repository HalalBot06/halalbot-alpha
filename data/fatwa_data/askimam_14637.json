  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamu Alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu wa maghfiratuh,\nI would like to know what the true status of women is in Islam, especially considering the following: (I have phrased the following in question form in case there is an ayah or mutawaatir hadith that expressly says women are spiritually equal to men, in which case it might constitute kufr.)\n\n \n\n \n\n1) My question is whether the following beliefs are actually kufr.\nIf so, it would be greatly appreciated if you could explain how they are wrong.\n\n \n\n \n\nI have heard from Deobandi muftis, as well as others, that women are spiritually equal in Islam due to the fact that the Quran specifically states that their actions will be rewarded as well as men's. It is also proven through hadiths that men will have 72 hoors and 2 Earth wives in Jannah, but that Allah(swt), in his infinite mercy, will not subject women to the pangs of jealousy. However, most women would not want their husband to have more than one wife, even if they could be assured that he would always love her the best. I believe the fact that there will be no jealousy in Jannah is what you're referring to when you say that multiple wives there is not analogous to multiple wives here? Allah (swt) has also said that those in Jannah will have whatever they desire. However, doesn't this show that women's desires will be \"adjusted\" in Jannah, so that they will have what they desire, as long as their desires are not conflicting with men's? I will be perfectly honest with you here. I am only divulging this because I wish to explain why my feelings are so acute. My idea of a happy life has always, even as a child, been that I would have a husband who would love me and I would be more than enough for him, and he in fact, would not want any other woman, even if he could have her, and that, together we would raise our children to be pillars of Islam in society. I assumed that if I did not get this in the duniya, I would get this in Jannah. Basically, if every man in Jannah, regardless of his status is given thse 74 wives, and no woman would want to share her husband, than doesn't this mean that even the lowest-ranking man is considered superior to the highest-ranking woman? Doesn't it seem like women's actions are only equal to a man's when they are doing the same thing? For example, when they are both engaged in dhikr, they both get equal reward, but the labor pains of a woman in childbirth are not equal to the pains of a man while he is trying to provide for his family, or in Jehad? They will both be rewarded, but there is no way a woman's actions can be worth as much as a man's.\n\n \n\n \n\nIt may also be said that women only get depressed knowing there will be Hoors in Jannah because the feminist movement has led them to change their fitrah so that they think they don't like it, but deep-down they really don't mind. If this is the case, than doesn't that also mean that a woman has no right to be possessive of her husband, and is in fact only allowed to be possessed? Hasn't she been degraded to a possession, if even a precious one? Not only this, but doesn’t the mere existence of the Hoor show that women are not enough for men, and that they deserve more than women simply by virtue of being men? Also, don't many hadith refer to the most precious “possession” as a virtuous woman? So does this not also show that women are meant to be possessions?\n\n \n\n \n\nEven in your website http://www.jamiat.org.za/v36_nikah.html, your argument seems to be basically that it has directly been commanded that animals and slaves should be treated well, and that wives are more deserving. But if wives are more deserving, why doesn't it explicitly say so? Isn't it possible that\n<<‘The most complete of believers in faith are those who are best in character. The best of you are those who are best to their wives.’ (Mishkat)>> actually shows that the good treatment of wives is the least important? If a man treats the person who has the least right to expect good treatment from him well, it would be assumed that he treats the things that are more deserving so much better. Isn't it possible that this is what the Hadith is referring to?\n\n \n\n \n\nI have heard many people say that it is more stressed on men to treat their wives well, and in the case of polygyny, equally well, than vice-versa. Really, all this means is that the husband must divide his wealth equally among them (and that wealth only has to be enough to cover all of their necessities) and not outrightly abuse anyone of them. Granted, he must also divide his nights equally, but all of these injunctions are hardly difficult. His rights to his wives may be more stressed, but his rights are also more easily fulfilled. And even if they are stressed more, it is still just as incumbent upon her to do everything he says as it is for him to give her money every week. Isn't it possible that Allah(swt) only created women as a test for the men on Earth, and they are never equal in worth? Men are striving towards the great reward in Heaven, but aren't women being pushed to simply try and avoid Hell because they cannot expect a similar level of reward in Heaven?\nYou may very well think that it is ridiculous to think all this simply because men are getting Hoor in the Afterlife, but no one can deny that one, if not the, most important relationship for anyone is their marital relationship. So if women are not getting what they most desire, while men are, they are obviously not equal, so can't it be assumed that Allah(swt) does not love them as much?\n2) If this is the case, of course, naudhubillah, it does not give women the right to question Allah(swt) but how should we reconcile ourselves to the fact that no matter how closely we follow His commandments He will never love as much as he loves men? I have also heard that when Nabi(saw) referred to women as the \"twin halves of men,\" it was in terms of sin, not in terms of virtue. In fact, did not you say in fatwa #12353 that Hawwa(as) is more culpable than Adam(as)? From what I understood, she did not do what she did out of malice, but because she really understood it to be the best course of action. Does not this show that women are inevitably going to be inferior in virtue as well, if only because they are inferior in intellect? In fact, the Hadith in Mishkat in which Rasulallah mentions the inferiority of women in intelligence, does not he also explicitly say that they are likewise lacking in religion? 3) What else can this mean?\n\n \n\n \n\nAbout women's \"jihaad\" being in their home, aren't there different levels of jihaad? 4) Perhaps this is a low level of jihaad? There are also hadiths such as <<\"Among my followers the best of men are those who are best to their wives, and the best of women are those who are best to their husbands. To each of such women is set down a reward equivalent to the reward of a thousand martyrs. Among my followers, again, the best of women are those who assist their husbands in their work, and love them dearly for everything, save what is a transgression of Allah's laws.\">> However I have not been able to find anyone who can say whether this is authentic.\n\n \n\n \n\nAs to whether or not we should worry about what Jannah will be like, Allah(swt) has given men something specific to motivate them (in fact, many of the suicide bombers nowdays claim it as their goal) and not only have women been left to wonder, but\nthe very thing sent down to motivate men is something that would make a woman question what her afterlife would be like. Doesn't this show that perhaps Allah(swt) might not love women as much as men? If it does not mean they are inferior or less precious to Allah(swt), what else can it possibly mean?\n\n \n\n \n\n5) If women really are inferior in Islam, shouldn't women be taught to accept the fact that they are inferior instead of being told that they are \"spiritually equal,\" because that would actually be a way of sugar-coating the religion? Regardless of whether or not women are equal, they have to follow Allah(swt)'s commands; no true believer can deny that. Personally, I am trying to follow the right path because I know how important it is to do what Allah(swt) commands, regardless of whether I end up in Hell or Heaven. I hope that you can answer this question, as I know for a fact that I am not the only woman wondering about this. Jazakumullah Khair for your time and efforts, and please make dua that Allah(swt) gives this ummah the ability to understand this deen and practice it fully.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nThis world is a test and Allah has placed a natural desire for gold, silver, money etc.  If a person uses these to prepare for the hereafter, he will be successful.  But if a person fulfills his desires without the remembrance of the hereafter, he will be from amongst the people of loss in the hereafter. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAllah (swt) has placed in every person the desire for the opposite sex and the greatest test for a Muslim is how he fulfills this desire.  He can fulfill his desire the haraam way or through marriage. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRasullullah (saw) said regarding the severity of this test, “I have not left a more harmful and sever temptation for men than women.”                                               (Bukhari & Muslim)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn today’s time, this test has become even more difficult because of the evil environment we are living in.  To motivate men to accomplish this duty, Allah (swt) and Rasullullah (saw) have described the reward of Jannah for controlling their desires. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn Jannat there are many types of bounties and rewards. Additionally, one should bear in mind that Allah Ta'ala has promised different bounties in Paradise for different categories of people as well as for different deeds. This ayah outwardly addresses the males of this ummah and promises them Hoors in the Hereafter. Consequently, a Muslima will not be adversely affected when her pious husband is endowed with a Hoor. It is explicitly\nmentioned in the Holy Qura'n that:\n\na) Allah Ta'ala shall remove from the hearts and minds of the inmates of Paradise any rancor, malice, jealousy or sense of injury. [See 15:47]\n\n \n\n\nb) The Believing wife and children will be joined with their Believing husband/ father in Paradise . [52:21]\n\nFrom the above one can conclude that a Muslima will not be deprived of her husband's company in paradise.\n\n \n\n\nFurther it is mentioned in a lengthy Hadith that Rasulullah Sallallaahu-alaihi-wasallam was asked a similar question by one of his wives. He consoled her by explaining that the believing woman of this world will be far more beautiful and attractive than the Hoors. This will be due to the excessive ibaadah that they (the woman of this world) had\nperformed.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAccording to a narration of Tabrani, the wife will be superior to all the Hoors of the husband in Jannah. (Majmauz-zawaaid vol.10 pg.417)\n\n \n\nThe wives of the believers will stay with their husbands.  Women who never married in this world will be given a choice to get married with any (unmarried) man they wish.  If they do not like any of them, a special man will be created for them (similar to the hurs) and Allah (swt) will join both of them in marriage.  (Fatawa Mahmudiya vol.5 pg. 298)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAllama Alusi mentions in his tafsir that a person’s wife in this world will remain his wife in the hereafter.  The love between a Muslim husband and wife is a true love because it will last forever.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAllah (swt) says:\n\n \n\n“And they will have by them chaste women who will restrain their glances (on their husbands only) and will be of equal age.”                                                 (38:52)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAllah has made these women devoted and loving to their husbands only.  They will not desire anyone else and will not even raise their eyes to look at anyone else besides their husbands.  Another interpretation of this verse is that these women will be so beautiful that they will keep their husband’s glances fixed on them only.  The women of Jannat will also have the same age as their husbands so that they can relate to each other better and have a perfect relationship. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIt appears that your concern devolves around women's feelings. Obviously, our hearts and its feelings are in the control of Allah and He has promised every dweller of Jannah peace and contentment.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe following verse and Ahadith explicitly show that the treatment of wives is not the least important.  If it was not important, divorce could have been recommended rather than mentioning the virtues and importance of good treatment.   In reality, divorce is the most disliked permissible act.  Also, before the advent of Islam women were often treated worse than animals. The Prophet wanted to put a stop to all cruelties to women and preached kindness towards them.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAllah states in the Quran:\n\n \n\n“O you who believe, it is not permissible for you to forcibly inherit women.  Do not restrain them with the intent of taken back some of that which you gave them; except if they perpetrated flagrant immorality.  Live with them in kindness and if you dislike them, then perchance you dislike something wherein Allah has placed abundant good.”\n\n \n\n                                                                                                (surah An-Nisa, Ayat 19)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHadhrat Aisha (R.A.) reports that Rasulullah (saw) said, “One of those Iman is the most complete is he whose behavior is best towards his wife and who is most compassionate.” (Mishkat pg. 282)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHadhrat Aisha (R.A.) narrates that Nabi (sallahllahu alaihi wa sallam) said, “The best of you is he who is the best towards his wife, and I am the best towards my wives.” (Mishkaat pg.281)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThis action of Rasulullah sallahllahu alaihi wa sallam’s shows that the good treatment of wives is one of the most important (not the least).\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHadhrat Abu Hurairah (r.a.) narrates that “Rasulullah (saw) said, “No believing man should dislike a believing woman.  If he dislikes a certain quality in her, he should be pleased with another.” (Muslim vol.1 pg. 475)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Prophet (saw) has also said \"The world, the whole of it, is a commodity and the best of the commodities of the world is a virtuous wife.\"\n\n \n\nThe Prophet (saw) was most emphatic in enjoining upon Muslims to be kind to their women when he delivered his famous khutba, Hajj al-Wada (Farewell Pilgrimage). In it he ordered those present, and through them all those Muslims who were to come later, to be respectful and kind towards women. He said: \"Fear Allah regarding women. Verily you have married them with the trust of Allah, and made their bodies lawful with the word of Allah. You have got (rights) over them, and they have got (rights) over you in respect of their food and clothing according to your means.\"\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHe was always ready to help widows and exhorted his followers to do the same. Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet said: \"One who makes efforts (to help) the widow or a poor person is like a mujahid (warrior) in the path of Allah, or like one who stands up for prayers in the night and fasts in the day.\"\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBoth men and women have tough responsibilities.  In reality, it is extremely difficult to show equality between the wives.  The husband needs to find a job through which he can earn enough to support his family.  He needs to be cautious and treat each wife with the same or similar item.  This might seem easy to say but it is difficult to do.  Moreover, we can look at this in a different aspect.  It is beneficial when the numbers of men are radically decreased (for example, during the occasion of Jihaad when many men are martyred), widows are offered new homes and the opportunity to protect their virtue.  There are also times such as today that women are in the majority.  During these times women are allowed to share husbands so that they are not compelled to live their lives in sin.  They are afforded the opportunity to live their lives chastely as wives and mothers.  Those who are too myopic to perceive the depths of matters cannot understand this wisdom, and therefore resort to raising objections.  Especially when the Shariah stipulates the condition of justice and equality between wives, a person has no scope to object.                         (Anwaarul-Bayaan, vol.2 pg. 243)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThere is no such thing as Allah loves men more than women.  In Islam there is no difference between men and women as far as their relationship to Allah is concerned. They both are promised the same reward for good conduct and the same punishment for evil conduct.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Qur'an says:\n\n \n\n“And for women are rights over men similar to those of men over women.” (2:226)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Qur'an, in addressing the believers, often uses the expression, ‘believing men and women’ to emphasize the equality of men and women in regard to their respective duties, rights, virtues and merits.\n\n \n\nThe Quran says:\n\n \n\n“For Muslim men and women, for believing men and women, for devout men and women, for true men and women, for men and women who are patient and constant, for men and women who humble themselves, for men and women who give in charity, for men and women who fast, for men and women who guard their chastity, and for men and women who engage much in Allah's praise, for them has Allah prepared forgiveness and great reward.” (33:35)\n\n \n\n“Who so does that which is right, and believes, whether male or female, him or her will We quicken to happy life. (16:97”)\n\n \n\nWomen have a very high status in the eyes of Allah (swt).  There are many Ahadith and Quranic Ayats showing the status of a woman and the amount of hardship she goes through.  Allah has mentioned women over and over in the Quran in comparison to men.  What can be of a more virtue than this?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAllah Ta’ala says in the Quran:\n\n \n\n“And We commanded man (to be good) about his parents.  His mother carried him facing weakness after weakness, and his weaning is in two years:” Be grateful to Me and to your parents.  To Me is the ultimate return.”  [Surah Luqman, Ayat 14]\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFirst Allah commands us to be good towards our parents and straight after that He talks about the pain and trials a woman goes through.  Since, it is the mother who faces most of the hardship in bringing up the child, therefore, the right of mother has been made to precede even the right of thefather in the Shari’ah of Islam. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRasulullah (saw) has said Jannah lies under the feet of the mother.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNarrated Abu Hurairah (R.A.):  A man came to Allah’s Messenger (saw) and aid, “O Allah’s Messenger! Who is more entitled to be treated with the best companionship by me?” The Prophet (saw) said, “Your mother.”  The man said, “Who is next?” The Prophet (saw) said, “Your mother.”  The man further said, “Who is next?”  The Prophet (saw) said, “Your mother.”  The man asked (for the fourth time), “Who is next?” The Prophet (saw) said, “Your father.”                                                                                                                                                                (Riyadhus-Saliheen vol.1 pg.135 and Bukhari vol.8 pg.78)\n\n \n\nIn another tradition, the Prophet (saw) advised a believer not to join the war against the Quraish in defense of Islam, but to look after his mother, saying that his service to his mother would be a cause of his salvation. Mu'awiyah, the son of Jahimah, reported that Jahimah came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said, \"Messenger of Allah! I want to join the fighting (in the path of Allah) and I have come to seek your advice.\" He said, \"Then remain in your mother's service, because Paradise is under her feet.\"\n\n \n\nThese aspects were much emphasized by the Prophet (peace be upon him). He exhorted men to marry women of piety and women to be faithful to their husbands and kind to their children. He said:\n\n \n\nThe religion of Islam gave women an honorable status and established their dignified equality with men.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nAnswer by a young American women.\n\n \n\nChecked & Approved by\n\n \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
