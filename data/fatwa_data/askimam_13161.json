  "question": "making up for missed salaats of 7 yrs",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have many, many Salah to make up from the past 7 years of my life.  While I am making these Salah up, will I still get reward for my Nafl Salah?  I heard a scholar say that if you have lots of Salah to make up there is no point in making Nafl Salah.  May Allah reard you immensely.Wasalam\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn principle, it is more important to make up for the missed Salaats. While making intention for the missed Salaat, you could make intention of the desired Nafl of that time, e.g. Shurooq, Dhuhaa, etc. You will be rewarded for the Nafl as well.\n\n \n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\nFATWA DEPT."
