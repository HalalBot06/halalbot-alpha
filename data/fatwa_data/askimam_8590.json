  "question": "Could you please explain? Does it mean that if I fast only a few days after 15 shaban (not continuously, to keep healthy) it will be permissible or is it totally not allowed?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn reference to question #1560. it is mentioned that Rasulullah (sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) said, \"Do not fast after the first half of the month of Sha'ban is gone.\" Does this apply that it is totally prohibited or does the hadeeth mean that one who fears weakness or wont be able to welcome ramdaan should not fast after that? I ask because some one told me that it is not allowed after 15 shabaan. And before reading this question I knew that Rasulullah (sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) used to fast abundantly in shaban. But I read the hadeeth and am now confused. Could you please explain? Does it mean that if I fast only a few days after 15 shaban (not continuously, to keep healthy) it will be permissible or is it totally not allowed?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe prohibition is not absolute.\n\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised people not to fast towards the end of Sha?baan so that it doesn?t affect them and make them weak for Ramadhaan. If a person is strong and healthy and is certain fasting towards end of Sha?baan will not affect his vigour for Ramadhaan, then it will be perfectly permissible. (Mishkaat pg.172)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
