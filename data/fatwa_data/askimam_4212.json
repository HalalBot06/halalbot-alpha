  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs-salaamu alaikum, I once made a promise to Allah (saying \"wallahi\") that I would give up a certain act. Unfortunately I have broken that promise twice. I have prayed salaat at-Tawba on both occassions, but seem to recall that their may be an expiation (fasting? or feeding the poor?). Please can advise me what I need to do. Also, how can I cancel my promise if I feel I can no longer hold firm to it. Fi Amaanillah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou had take a vow (Yamin) which should have been carried out. Since you\nviolated your oath or vow, you should do one of the following: a) Feed ten\npoor people, or b) Clothe ten poor people.\n\nIf you are unable to do any of the above, you should fast for three\nconsecutive days. Since you already broke your promise, your promise (or\nvow) is already cancelled.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
