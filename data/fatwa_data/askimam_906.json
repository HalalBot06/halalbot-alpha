  "question": "During Namaz, our Pants or Pajamas should below or above the ankles?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn a book named as Our Dialogue(the Religious Editor Arab News Jeddah) it has been written that it is unnecessary because it neither follows a Sunnah nor gives a decent appearance.(Covering the Ankles). Wassalam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'The area of the garment\n(which covers) beyond the ankles is in the fire.' (Mishkaat pg.373)\n\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Allah will not look at that\npeson who wears (beyond his ankles) his garment with mercy.' (Ibid)\n\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) informed us of a person who was\nswallowed by the earth due to walking with pride and thereby having his\ngarment below his ankles.' (Ibid)\n\nFrom the above Ahaadith, the prohibition of wearing the garment below the\nankles is abundantly clear. Is the appearance of a prohibited act decent in\nany way? The claim that the prohibition is not a way of the Sunnah is\nincorrect.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
