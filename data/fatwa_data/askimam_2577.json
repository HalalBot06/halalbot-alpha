  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHadhrat Muaz bin Jabal (Radhiallaahu Ánhu) narrates that once Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) did not see him for the Jumu'ah Salaat. When\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) completed the Jumu'ah Salaat he\nvisited Muaz saying, \"O Muáz! Why is it that I did not see you for Jumu'\nah?'. He said, 'O Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam), I am owing a\nYahoodi (Jew) an Awqiya (equivalent to forty Dirhams) of silver, and when I\ncame out (for Jumu'ah) he held me back.'\n\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, \"O Muáz! Should I not teach\nyou a Duá that even if you were indebted to the extent of mount Sabar\n(mountain in Yemen), then Allah Taãla will fulfil that (debt) for you. O\nMuáz! Make this Duá:\n\n\n\nSalaams"
