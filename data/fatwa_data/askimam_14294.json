  "question": "Tell me that matam is haram (in the light of Quran) because this is hadees",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nsunni) and i want to know some important knowledge about shia peoples. My questions are? 1) Tell me that matam is haram (in the light of Quran) because this is hadees and i don't get any information from Quran because Quran gives us details and also gives us concepts like namaz, kalma, etc but it is not discussed in details and then we look for details in hadees or in other books. - Hazrat Owais Kern,i(r.z) brokes is all tooths in the love of Hazrat Muhammad (P.B.U.H), before he was the ordinary person but breaking his teeth he become Sahabi-e-Rasool, this amazing history also matches with matam concept. (can not type in detail) 2) Why they cry for Imam's(r.z) [Ahle Bait]. - Hazrat Yaqoob(a.s) cried for Hazrat Yousuf(a.s) and He also knows that His son is alive but He still cry until His son found. This matches with crying for Imam(r.z) (can not type in detail) 3) If any thing matches from above in Quran then this means that we must not say bads words for shia religion because they are right but only one religion goes to paradise then please tell me who will pass to paradise. There are lots of issues but these issues are important i always ask from shia peoples that why you cry, why you do matam, etc... but one day my friend who is shia asked him that tell me the reasons of matam & crying then he told me the above, i also verifies it from other resources, i found that shia peoples are also right. The hadees 'Matam is Haram' is not right, i verifies it from lots off Molvees and Aalims, they say that always match Hadees with Quran if the hadees not matches but it concept matches then it is fine otherwise don't accept it. One thing more that is who is our leader because in shia religion they accept ayatollah as a leader and every shia accept them as leader So i'm asking from you too that what is your opinion in the light of Quran.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The concept of Matam practised by the Shi’as has been expressly forbidden in the Hadith. An individual incident like the one mentioned by you cannot be used to refute the prohibition of Matam. Hadhrat Uways [radhiallaahu anhu] was overcome with a zeal of intense love at that moment. So, this incident cannot be used to prove anything.\n\n2. Crying is natural but the manner in which the Shi’as express their lamentation by loud crying, etc. is not permissible.\n\n3. We, the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaa, firmly believe that Shi’as are a deviated sect.\n\n4. We do not accept him as our leader. If the Shi’as wish to accept him, that is their problem.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
