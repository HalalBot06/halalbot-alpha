Can myself and my mother give our share to sadaqa a jaria. What are the possible forms the sdat a jaria. Can it be used for the construction of the masjid / community center for muslims or muslim school?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to our understanding, your sister passed away and she is survived by a mother and two sisters. You did not state whether your father predeceased your sister or not. We also understand that you did have a brother.\n\nIf your father predeceased your sister, then your sister’s estate will be divided into 5 equal shares. The mother will inherit one share and each sister will inherit two shares. All your sister’s belongings will form part of her estate. That includes her savings in the post office. The interest amount on the savings will not form part of the estate. That amount must be given to the poor and needy without the intention of gaining reward. Your mother, sister and yourself may give charity with your own money of Sawaab-e-Jaariya for your sister.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
