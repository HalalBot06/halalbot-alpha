  "question": "Where a bride or a groom is forced or threatened into marriage against their will, is it valid ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn some traditional societies, bride or groom do not have a say in their marriages. Their parents choose bride or groom based on economic or status consideration of the other party concerned. Ilm of neither the bride or groom is taken into consideration. No consideration is given for the feelings of bride or groom. A few married men disappointed with marriage resort to extra-marital affairs. A few married women unhappy with their husband run away with their lovers. Majority of those dissatisfied with their marriage still stay in their marriage due to fear of shame arising out of their act and lead a false life. In some communities we are forced to put on a false face.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssalaamu Álaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nKnowing the importance and sacredness of a marriage commitment, the boy and\ngirl having consulted with their seniors and making Istikhaara, should make\ntheir own independent choice.\n\nThey should not be compelled to marry against their wishes as the\nconsequences (non-compatibility, divorce, disputes, custody of children,\netc.) are too ghastly to bear. Parents should not compel their children to\nmarry against their wishes due to economic status reasons.\n\nAnd Allah Taãla Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
