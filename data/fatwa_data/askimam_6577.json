  "question": "My question is, why do we as muslims pray 5 times a day in arabic? If god is all-knowing then he should understand all languages. Why do we specifically have to pray in arabic?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nFirstly, we have been commanded to pray Salaat in Arabic. Hence, we maintain\nthe common language of Arabic within our Salaats.\n\nSecondly, our Deen is not based on our logical reasoning alone. It is based\nupon what has been transcribed and narrated to us from Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Whether it makes sense to us or not, we are\ncompelled to adhere to it.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
