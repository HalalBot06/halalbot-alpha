  "question": "I changed my surname. How will I be called on day of Qiyaamat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI changed my surname due as my father's surname is not a Muslim surname. He converted but did not change his name. I did not want my children to have the difficulty as I had growing up being teased/mocked as a result of having a Non-Muslim surname. Please help as would like to know how I would be called on the day of Qiyaamat.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOn the day of Qiyaamat, one will not be called by his surname. Thus, the change of your surname does not matter.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
