  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni would like to know regarding what is to be done after 40 days of child birth.is it true that we have to perform a proper ghusl n wear clean clothes and clean the bed linen .please solve my queries as i m confused as my 40th day is coming up very shortly.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere is no basis in Shari’ah to wait specifically 40 days after childbirth. According to the Shari’ah, the bleeding after childbirth is termed Nifaas. The maximum period of Nifaas is 40 days if the bleeding continues. In this instance, the woman will take a bath and resume the obligation of performing Salaat even though the bleeding continues. Further to the bath, she will have to renew her Wudhu for each Salaat time.\n\nIf the bleeding stops before 40 days, then the Nifaas would be regarded as ended. The woman will have to take a bath and resume her obligation in Shari’ah to perform her Salaat. She does not have to wait for 40 days specifically. There is also no basis to change her bed linen and wear new clothes.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
