  "question": "Reciting of Qua'an while exercising is it halal or haram?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nReciting of Qua'an while exercising is it halal or haram?\n\nPlease I have a friend that likes to listen to reciting of Qua'an while exercising on his stationery bike...is this halal or haram?...he also tells me that he finds pleasure in trying to memories the qua'an this way...kindly advise\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe Qur’aan is the last testament of Allah, the words of the Almighty. This holy book was revealed as a guidance for mankind, a perfect guide containing etiquettes, science, history, informing man of his duty to his creator. Undoubtedly, the Qur’aan is matchless, no book can ever compete with it. It is not any ordinary book. It deserves respect due to many factors, namely;\n\n1. With whom it is linked to, it is the speech of Allah;\n\n2. Excellence of its composition;\n\n3. Content – the excellence of its content.\n\nAllah mentions in his very book how one should treat His sublime words, ‘When the Qur’aan is read, listen to it with attention, so that you may receive mercy.’\n\nHere, three things are mentioned:\n\n1. When the Qur’aan is recited, listen to it with attention. Examine the words ‘listen with attention’, not normal listening is required, what is desired is one’s mind must be there, having apt attention. There are many people who listen but don’t hear;\n\n2. In the verse, the word ‘Fansitoo’ is used. It has been translated as ‘keep your peace’. Another translation of this word is ‘keep silent’.\n\n3. When one follows the proper conduct, it is a means of gaining the mercy of Allah.\n\nIt is not permissible to listen to the Qur’aan whilst exercising. To do so is against the sanctity of the Qur’aan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
