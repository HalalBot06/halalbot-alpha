  "question": "Is there any Dua or treatment that I can do inorder not to alert my wife to be and save my respect?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am getting married soon, Insha-Allah. and have a problem with intimacy. My erections are not very strong and I ejaculate very very quickly. Is there any Dua or treatment that I can do inorder not to alert my wife to be and save my respect?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPremature ejaculation is mainly the result of the Haraam act of masturbation. The husband (as well as the wife) then suffer the evil consequences of this evil deed for the rest of their lives.\n\nIt is sometimes due to a medical condition. In that case medical treatment should be sought.\n\nThere is no special Dua for this condition. The most important cure is Taqwa. In particular, guard the eyesight very strongly. Be extremely cautious of stray gazes. This will insha-Allah create noor (spiritual light) within oneself.\n\nKeep in mind that only and only a muttaqi (one imbued with taqwa ? fear of Allah Ta?ala) can truly satisfy his wife in bed.\n\nWe make Dua Allah Ta?ala relieves you of your condition.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
