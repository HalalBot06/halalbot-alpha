  "question": "Could you please tell me the meaning of the names Aria and Arman. Are these proper muslim names?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe could not find a meaning for aria while arman means \"Armenians\". Both these do not seem to be suitable names.\n\nOne should keep names that are mentioned by Allah, his Prophet (SAW) or that are generally kept by the Muslims (Shaami and Bazzaaziyyah)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Hussein Kadodia\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Ml. Imraan Vawda"
