  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Atika- Pronounced Aatikah, means one who has been emancipated and freed from the fire of Jahannum. Suitable Islamic name Moheena- Pronounced Muheenah, means insulting, offending etc. Not suitable Islamic name Nayla- Pronounced Naa-ilah, means a boon and a winner etc. Suitable Islamic name.\n\n2. The reason for Salah being forbidden at certain times is that Nabi (Sallallahu Alayhi WaSallam) prohibited us from performing salah at those times. Nabi (Sallallahu Alayhi WaSallam) mentioned that at sunrise, zawaal (noon) and sunset the sun is between the horns of Shaitaan, thus we should not perform Salah then. These are also times when the sun-worshippers worship the sun.\n\n3.Yes.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
