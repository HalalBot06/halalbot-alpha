  "question": "Is it wrong to ask for patience in our dua?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. I was told that if we ask Allah to give us patience, then we are also asking for hardships. I have been told by an elder that we should avoid asking for patience because the time when we most need patience is during any hardship, so it is better not to ask for patience to avoid bringing hardships. Can you please state your opinion? 2. Can women read books such as Faza?il-e-A?maal and make zikr while menstruating? Is it okay to touch books like Faza?il-e-A?maal during menses because it has some verses of the Holy Qur?an written in it? 3. I have trouble sitting in the prescribed way for women in salaat. I heard that during sajdah, our toes should be pointing towards the qiblah.. So, during sajdah, my legs are folded at the knee joint with each thigh over the respective calf, i.e. right thigh over right calf, etc. and my toes are pointing towards the qiblah. Then during Attahayyat, I just sit so that the top of my feet (dorsum of foot) are touching the ground. I have tried sitting so that my right thigh is over my left thigh and right leg over my left leg with my feet directed towards the right, but I find that my toes don?t always point towards the qiblah in this way because my feet bend a little bit. I also find this postion to be uncomfortable and find it difficult to concentrate on my salaat. Can you please tell me what to do about this? Is it wrong for me to pray in the position that I have been praying in? Jazakallah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There is no harm in making Du'aa for Sabr (patience). The Du'aa will then\nsimply mean that when any hardship does appear, Allah Ta'ala should at that\ntime grant us patience. Hardships and difficulties are inevitable in this\nworldly life. Furthermore, Sabr also means steadfastness on good deeds, so\nthere is no harm in making Du'aa for Sabr.\n2. Such books may be read by a lady in menses, but the actual portion of the\npage on which an Aayat of the Qur'aan is written may not be touched.\n3. In Sajdah, a woman should take out both her feet to the right. The left\ncalf will be below the right thigh, and the right calf to the side of the\nright thigh. The toes do not have be directly towards the Qiblah, but simply\nroughly in that direction. The feet should not be upright. In Attahiyyaat,\nshe will sit in a similar manner, while on her left buttocks.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCH"
