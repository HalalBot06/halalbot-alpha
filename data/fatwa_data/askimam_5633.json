  "question": "In a sale transaction, does there have to be a representative present at the time of the transaction for every party involved in the transaction?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nFor example, when using a credit card or debit card, the buyer and seller assume that the bank or credit card company (third party) will pay out the sale amount. However, the bank or card company representative is not actually present to confirm this, thus leaving a sense of ambiguity in regards to the payment. Please explain, in detail, whether or not debit and credit cards are allowed in Islamic Law (assuming that all payments are due to be made within the interest free period).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible to use credit cards. Although the bank representative is\nnot physically present to confirm the transaction, it is a guarantee. When\nthe seller enters the credit card for processing, the bank will immediately\nguarantee the transaction, thus, confirming that the seller is entitled to\nthe respective payment by the bank. This is also exactly how a bank cheque\nworks.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
