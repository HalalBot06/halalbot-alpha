  "question": "#1 What exactly is the pubic hair? For a male is it the hair on the Galbladder and around the Anus and the arm pits ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nQuestion: I have heard that in Hanafi Maslak one has to shave his pubic hair. If the public hair are not shaven for 40 days then the Salah is not acceptable. My Question is: #1 What exactly is the pubic hair? For a male is it the hair on the Galbladder and around the Anus and the arm pits ? #2 Can one use hair remover to remove pubic hair ? #3 Is it necessary to shave the pubic hair or can we use a trimmer also ? Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ: What is the area of shaving the pubic hair for a male and female?\nA: The area immediately under the navel is not to be shaven.\nThe area of shaving for a person (male / female) is above and around the\nprivate parts. If possible, it is commendable to shave around the hind\nprivate parts as well. (Al-Kaamil, commentary of Muslim; Imaam Nawawi vol. 1\npg. 128).\n\nThe pubic hair may be removed by means of hair remover or trimmer.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
