  "question": "Are Muslim males allowed to wear ear rings?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMuslim males should not wear ear rings at all. Wearing era rings is forbidden for Muslim males for two reasons:%0D%0A%0D%0AFirstly, wearing ear rings has been generally a female custom and Muslim males should not imitate the females in their dress, walk and talk, just as Muslim females should not imitate the males. The Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) cursed those men who imitate women and those women who imitate men. (Bukhari; Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0ASecondly, the men who wear ear rings are generally people with queer character. They are mostly homosexuals and morally perverse people. Muslims should try to resemble good, pious and righteous people. We must inform our youth who may become attracted to wear earrings that this is against the teachings of Islam. We should pay more attention to our youth so that they do not get involved in un-Islamic groups and immoral lifestyles. The youth may receive such evil influences if they are neglected at home and their parents do not provide them proper Islamic alternatives.%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A"
