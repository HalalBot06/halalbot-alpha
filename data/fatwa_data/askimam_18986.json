  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a very painful question that i have to ask you, while fasting this Ramazan I just could not control myself & got intimate with my wife. We did not have sexuall intercourse but while my wife was fondling me I ejaculated. What should i do now..i am very regretful now & do not no what i should do??

Remember, in future mere fondling with your wife while fasting will not render your fast to be makrūh (undesirable) as long as there is no fear of ejaculation or intercourse. Thus, if you fear any of the two it will be impermissible for you to fondle with your wife while fating.\n\nMoreover, Mubāsharat-e-fāhisha (i.e. the privates part of the husband and wife comes into contact without any barrier) is makrūh any way, whether there is fear of ejaculation/intercourse or not.2\n\n(Ahsanul Fatāwa, Vol.4, Pg.432, HM Saīd)1\n\n(Bahisti Zewar, Pg.956, Makki Darul Kutub)2\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl. Abduz Zaman,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nConcured by: Ml. Abdur Rahman Shareef, Student Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nUnder the guidance of:\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai Saheb\nDārul Iftā"
