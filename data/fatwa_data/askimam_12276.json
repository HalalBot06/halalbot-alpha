  "question": "1) How can I gain Ikhlas and Humility in my salaah as prescribed by Allah (SWT) â€˜s beloved messenger Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamualaikum Dear Mufti sahab. I hope you?re doing fine inshallah. 1) Alhumdulillah I memorized the meaning of surah al-fatihah and some short surahs so I can concentrate more in my salaah and ponder when I recite in it. However, sometimes I am heedless and recite, for ex. the first couple of verses of surah fatihah without thinkng about its meaning, then I go back and start from the beginnng again so I can reflect on it.; Is this going back that I?m doing permissible or not good. 2) What is the best and most loved time to pray the Salaat Ut Tasbeeh?3) How can I gain Ikhlas and Humility in my salaah as prescribed by Allah (SWT) beloved messenger Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)? 4) Is it a sunna to wear a silver ring? If I should then is there a limit to how much silver should be used for the ring? . Lastly, I.d like to thank you because I love you and all the staff of this website very much. I read a lot of your responses and I love your beautiful use of the words to explain. I feel like I really know you and I hope to meet you one day inshallah. I would be a blessing if you could remember me in your Dua? inshallah, my name is Sohail.. May Allah (SWT) reward you infinitely inshallah for your efforts. Jazakallahu Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe are fine, Alhamdulillah,%0D%0A%0D%0A1. If you realise that you have not concentrated in a portion of the salah, you should not go back and repeat that portion. Rather focus on what is left to be read.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. It is the practice of many of our Ulama to perform this Salah every Friday, before Zawaal, however performing it at night, in complete seclusion would also be praiseworthy and beneficial.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. The manner you have adopted to gain concentration is fine.Try to keep good company and if possible build a spiritual relationship with a pious person.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Nabi (sallallahu Alaihi wasallam) used a ring for the purpose of sealing letters to kings. If one needs a ring for sealing letters, then he could wear such a ring with the niyyah of sunnah. For one who doesn't require a ring for that purpose, then it would better not wear it as the necessity does not exist.%0D%0A%0D%0AJazakallahu Khairaa for you kind words. May Allah Ta'ala accept us all and use us for the propagation of his deen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMl.
