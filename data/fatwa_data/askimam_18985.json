  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThe water in our area is very cold in the morning.And a brother of mine does not pray Fajr because of his illness. When he takes wudhoo in the morning he starts to sneeze non-stop for a while and this makes him sick.What's the ruling concerning this?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIn the sight of Allah Ta’āla, salāh has a very great distinction. No other act of ῾ibādah is dearer to Allah Ta’āla than salāh. Allah Ta’āla has made five times salāh compulsory on His servants.\n\nRegarding the importance of Salāh; there are so many traditions of the Holy Prophet Sallalāhu ῾alayhe Wasalam that it is difficult to cover them all, a few quotations are, however, reproduced below as a benediction:\n\nAbū Mūsā radhiallāhu ῾anhu narrates that he heard the Prophet Sallalāhu ῾alayhe Wasalam saying; Paradise is guarantee for a person who offers Fajr and ῾Asr salāh.\n\n(Muttafaqun ῾alayh)\n\nIn another hadīth, it is mentioned that Allah Ta’āla has ordained five times salāh, and whosoever is mindful of his salāh, by doing wudhu properly and by praying at fixed hours with sincerity and devotion, is assured by Allah Ta’āla of his entry into Paradise, and whosoever does not guard his salāh, there is no such guarantee for him, he may or may not be forgiven.\n\n(Fazā’il ῾Amāl, Virtues of Salāh, Pg.24)\n\nSalāh has indeed a tremendous value. It affords us to receive Allah’s guarantee for Paradise.\n\nAs for discarding salāh; Rasulullāh Sallalāhu ῾alayhe Wasalam is reported to have said: salāh is a pillar of Dīn, and the one who has demolished this pillar (i.e. did not offer salāh), has in fact destroyed the Dīn. Salāh intervenes between man and Shirk. Discarding salāh is a major sin.\n\n(Fazā’il ῾Amāl, Virtues of Salāh, Pg.26)\n\nHadhrat Naufil bin Mu῾āwiyah radhiyallāhu ῾anhu narrates that he heard the Prophet Sallalāhu ῾alayhe Wasalam saying; a person who has missed one salāh is like one who has lost all his family and wealth.\n\n(Fazā’il ῾Amāl, Virtues of Salāh, Pg.36)\n\nIt is stated in another hadīth ῾Ishā and Fajr are very heavy on those who are munāfiq.1 May Allah Ta’āla save us.\n\n(Riyadhussālihīn, Pg.281, Dārussalām)1\n\n \n\nTherefore, due to illness, if cold water is harmful and making wudhu with it will increase the illness or delay its healing, then it will be obligatory to use warm water. However, if warm water is not available then he will have to perform tayammum and offer his salaah.\n\n(Bahisiti Zewar, Pg.87, Zam Zam)\n\n \n\nNote: Once a person recovers and making wudhu will no longer cause any harm, then tayammum performed on account of illness will break, and now it will be obligatory to make wudhu.\n\n(Bahisti Zewar, Pg.92, Zam Zam)\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl. Abduz Zaman,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nConcured by: Ml. Abdur Rahman Shareef, Student Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nUnder the guidance of:\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai Saheb\nDārul Iftā"
