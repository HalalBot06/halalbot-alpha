  "question": "How should I deal with my office colleagues in the office? my colleagues (non muslim) make fun of Islam and occassionally abuse Muslims.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn the office, my colleagues (non muslim) make fun of Islam and occassionally abuse Muslims. What should I do? Should I argue them or should I keep quiet. I prefer to keep quiet becasue if I tell them that Islam is the only true religon, then they will put more and more questions and I fear I may not be able to answer all their questons as my level of knowlege of Deen is limited. Please guide me how to deal with them.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallaah for writing to the institute regarding your present problem.%0D%0A%0D%0AI understand that this can be a distressing situation as these people choose moments when they can say the worst ignorant things about Islam. I too have been through a similar experience where fellow workers, (all ladies) would use the present political climate to 'rub my nose' into dirt.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou should use this situation to increase your knowledge of Islam and strengthen your imaan. Why not attend madrassa classes in your spare time and learn as much as you can so that you can become more knowledgeable about the most beautiful deen on earth? We have been encouraged to seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave. Knowledge of deen will benefit you in this world and the hereafter, insha'allah.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs far as handling your workmates is concerned, do ask Allah Ta'ala for protection against shaitaan each time they get into the 'act' against Islam. This is one of the avenues shaitaan uses to put doubt into your mind because you feel inadequate in terms of your knowledge and these non-Muslims ask you questions you are unable to answer. They tend to become experts on Islam too. If you wish, you could invite them to attend a masjid, speak to an Imaam or a learned scholar if they wish to obtain answers to their questions. You could also offer them literature on the topics in which they reveal their ignorance by condemning Islam.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs you gain more knowledge of Islam your confidence will increase and you may be able to invite to deen and handle some of their prejudices. At the moment make it a point of just informing them that you believe in one Allah (god) and that Mohammad (sallallaahu alayhi wassallam) was His last messenger. Make sure you that you give each one of them this message once. If they persist in being offensive and you feel unable to answer them, then remove yourself from their company for while. What do you mean they occasionally abuse Muslims? If you mean verbal abuse, then I suggest you do as I have suggested. If you mean physical abuse then you should use the law of the land to deal with them.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala strengthen your imaan and grant you knowledge to serve His deen to the best of your ability. Ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A1SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
