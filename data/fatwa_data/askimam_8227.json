  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Please recommend any dua I can make so as to stop or reduce snoring -- this would be a tremendous help not only to me but to my family members as well who have to deal with disturbed sleep owing to my snoring. 2. What does Quran/Hadith indicate as to the fate of Shaytaan on the day of judgement? 3. Would Jinnat also be held responsible for their actions on the day of judgement?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We suggest you cut down on your last meal for the day - in other words, eat less. Avoid getting to bed on a very full stomach. Recite the Masnoon Du?aas of sleeping. Also, we would like to add that snoring is natural. You don?t have to be concerned with it. Sleep in another room if others are disturbed.\n\n2. Shaytaan is doomed to hell on the day of judgment.\n\n3. Yes, the Jinnaat, like humans are also responsible for their actions.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
