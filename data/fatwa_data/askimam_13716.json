  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nA boy I would like to marry, has informed me that he sees jinns. I am a bit scared of this, and worry about being alone with him, and marrying him because of this. He has spoken to an Imaam about it, and was told that it is a gift from Allah (swt). Is it really a gift? I asked me to consult someone learned on the matter, and ask for it it to be taken away. He said that one should not question why some people see beyond this world and Allah(swt) has His reasons. I dont know what to do. Can he ask for it to be taken away, it has been becoming worst recently, now that he is trying to practice as a beter Muslim. Is he doing something wrong in his life that this happends? He often has encounters with them that has sexual conotations attached. Please help I would like to help him, i dont know If i can still consider marrying him. Is it wrong of me to think like this? Jazakallah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf you are afraid of the person because he sees Jinns, etc. then that may defeat the purpose of marriage being peace and comfort. You should also discuss your issue of marriage with the seniors of your family.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
