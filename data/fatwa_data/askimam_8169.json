  "question": "is doubt okay in food? 1) If things I ate werent haram and I thought they were, am I forgiven? I ask because actions are based on intentions and I thought they were haram and avoided them...",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI dont care if it takes long,the questions affect me everyday.My sheikh gave me reasons why American meat isnt jalala and is makruh tanzihi. Their blood-meal isnt a large enough amount compared to good food the eat. Even if it were jalala theres differing opinions. For a while before I thought their meat was possibly haram and their produce like milk and eggs. Before I knew about animals fed blood I thought just their produce was haram because a vitamin is put in milk I read was from pig but I found thats wrong(i thought in eggs too). I avoided that stuff then till I learned it wasnt from pig. My family never knew. But many times I ate from pressure,want, family pressure not to make anyone call me extreme etc. I was eithere in doubt or thought it was haram(the stuff was milk,cheese, family saliva who ate that regularly etc.). I made touba but made it more than 4 times. In Tirmidhi 3643 wine drinkers have 3 toubas then no more, and 40 days of prayer isnt accepted.So I lost a lot of hope after eating what I thought was haram. (1) If the things I ate werent haram and I just thought they were am I forgiven? I ask because actions are based on intentions and I thought they were or may be haram and avoided them except those times. (2) Are hormones that effect balance of hormones in the body okay or haram or makruh? (3) What if American animals are fed pig but arent fed much(like a normal amount of protein feed); are they still just makruh tanzihi?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. You are correct. A person?s actions are judged by his intentions. If you sincerely repented, be certain you are forgiven.\n\n2. It is permissible to take HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) if it does not contain any Haraam ingredient in it.\n\n3. It is permissible to eat the meat of animals which are fed with Haraam protein feed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
