  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a question to ask you regarding time travel. In modern day physics time travel is considered a real possibilty. I as a msulim am also very intrested in this topic. I am planning to study this topic in great depth which could take upto 6-9 years of intense studying.\n\nBut before i continue on this path i wanted to know what is islams opinion  on time travel E.G.Going back in time and changing things such as if ones father died in a car crash saving hime from this event which would result in him still being alive. Is this toipic of time travel against islamic thinking E.G.QADR and DESTINY or does such thinking go hand in hand with islam and QADR and DESTINY?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh.\n\nعن أبى هريرة قال قال رسول الله -صلى الله عليه وسلم- « المؤمن القوى خير وأحب إلى الله من المؤمن الضعيف وفى كل خير احرص على ما ينفعك واستعن بالله ولا تعجز وإن أصابك شىء فلا تقل لو أنى فعلت كان كذا وكذا. ولكن قل قدر الله وما شاء فعل فإن لو تفتح عمل الشيطان\n\nIt has been narrated on the authority of Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallahu Anhu) that Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) said “A strong Muslim is better and more beloved in the eyes of Allah than a weak Muslim. Crave for that which will benefit you, seek help from Allah Ta’ala and do not fall short in these practices. When you are faced with a calamity, do not say “Only if I did this or this”; but say this is what Allah had destined and He does as He desires, because the word “if” opens the doors to doubts created by shaitan.\n\nSahih Muslim Vol.15/16 Pg.431/2 (Darul Ma’rifah)\n\nWe understand from the abovementioned that it is incorrect for a Muslim to have the belief that he could change what was destined by Allah Ta’ala. A Muslim should accept whatever decision was made by Allah Ta’ala and move on with life, he should not desire to go back in life and change what has happened. A Muslim should have the belief that he can never change what Allah has destined, even if he was able to travel back in time.\n\nAs far as time travel itself is concerned, we present to you the following verse for your own consideration:\n\nقل لا أملك لنفسي ضرا ولا نفعا إلا ما شاء الله لكل أمة أجل إذا جاء أجلهم فلا يستأخرون ساعة ولا يستقدمون\n\nSay, “I have no power to bring a harm or a benefit to myself. For every people there is an appointed time. When the time comes they are not able to put it off for a moment,nor are they able to go ahead of it”.\n\n(Verse: 10:49)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMl.
