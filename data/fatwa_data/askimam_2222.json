  "question": "Whilst praying salaat i imagine (unintentionally) the most horrid and evil faces before me. Is my salaat valid ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu alaikum I'm having difficulty reading my salaat. Whilst reading i am seeing a 'white' coloured shape of a person, i think it's a man, it is difficult to concentrate. What should i do ? I sometimes see ugly faces as well and it scares me. I would like to think of myself as practising (we don't have a T.V). Because of this i am delaying my salaat, especially Esha. Jazakallah khair Wasalaam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou do not need to be worried of the validity of your Salaat. Your Salaat is%0D%0Avalid.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs for delaying your Salaat, if it helps you in any way, you may do so. On%0D%0Athe contrary, if it does not help you, then it is preferable for you to%0D%0Aperform your Salaat as soon as the time for the Salaat sets in. After Fajr%0D%0Aand Esha Salaats (and in the case of delaying the Salaat), then before the%0D%0ASalaat read, 'Laa Hawla Walaa Quwwata illaa billaahil Aliyy al-Adheem' 70%0D%0Atimes. It was also the habit of Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) to%0D%0Arecite the '4 Quls' (Surah Kaafiroon, Ikhlaas, Falaq and Naas) and Aayatul%0D%0AKursi, blow on his palms and pass them over his body before going to sleep.%0D%0AWhenever you get these visions, read, 'Laa Hawla Walaa Quwwata illaa%0D%0Abillaahil Aliyy al-Adheem' and say, 'Aamantu billaah Wa Rasoolihi' and have%0D%0Athis firm belief that nothing can harm you except through the will of Allah%0D%0ATa'ala. While performing your Salaat, try to keep your mind occupied by%0D%0Aconcentrating on your postures (e.g. how am I standing, how are my hands%0D%0Acrossed, etc.) and on your recitation, (e.g. how am I pronouncing my words,%0D%0Awhat am I going to read next, etc.). Pay attention and listen to yourself as%0D%0Aif you are listening to someone else reading.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala protect us from the evil of the evils ones and the jealousy%0D%0Aof the jealous ones, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
