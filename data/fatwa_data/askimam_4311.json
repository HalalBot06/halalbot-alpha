  "question": "I am a young woman frequently overwhelmed by sexual desires. I try fasting, but it doesn't seem to help. At times I even resort to masturbation. Unfortunately I don't know any Muslim men to marry.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a young American woman, a recent convert, a university student in a city with very few Muslims. Frequently I have extremely vivid sexual dreams about young men. When I wake up in the morning I feel terribly guilty, almost as if I have actually committed zina, and vow to purge my mind of this, but it comes back over and over again. Sometimes it only takes a single glimpse of an attractive young man, not even a second look, to start up these thoughts again. And then when I sin by masturbating, I curse myself as being no better than a zania (whore). I know I mustn't despair, but it is very difficult. I was brought up with all the \"benefits\" of a so-called \"sexually liberated\" culture, such as sex education, explicit entertainment, and the like, which only exacerbates my situation. I feel enslaved by my sexual desires, not liberated by them. I want to repent, insha'Allah, but I feel helpless.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe biological change in a human being that demands fulfilment of ones%0D%0Acarnal desires is natural. It cannot be eliminated without fulfilling it. It%0D%0Acan only be suppressed to a certain level. We agree with you that a sexually%0D%0Aliberated culture enslaves a person and exacerbates an already provoked%0D%0Asituation. Your acknowledgement of that coupled with the guilt of evil%0D%0Athoughts is a positive sign. Sister, all you can do is to develop the%0D%0Acourage and exercise patience and restraint until Allah opens the way for%0D%0Ayou. Your desperation should not drive you to make any hasty decisions as%0D%0Athat may be detrimental to you, creating a worse situation. Recite 500%0D%0Atimes daily Durood and salaams to our prophet. That is effective in getting%0D%0Aa compatible marriage partner.
