  "question": "I have noticed that people often move from the place where they are reading their Farz namaaz to another place in the mosque to read their sunnat and nafl salaah. Is there some benefits in doing this?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Mustahabb (preferable) to break up the Sufoof (rows) and spread out\nafter the Fardh Salaat so that a person entering does not fall into doubt\nregarding the Jamaat's completion.\n\nConcerning a Munfarid (person who performed his Fardh without Jamaat), it\nwill be better for him to shift to another place for his Sunnat and Nafl\nSalaats as well. (Fataawa Darul Uloom vol.1 pg.243; Darul Ishaat)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
