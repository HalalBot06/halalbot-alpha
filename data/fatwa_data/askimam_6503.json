  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it permissible for a person to borrow or take out a loan through a bank and use the money to go for Hajj or Umrah? Also, if the person has 80% of the money for Hajj or Umrah, can the person make a loan through a bank for the remaining 20% of the money so that the person can perform the Hajj and Umrah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for a person to take out a loan and go for Hajj.\nFirstly, he would have to go to a bank and would therefore pay interest on\nthat amount, be it how small.\n\nSecondly, if the person is able to pay towards the loan he may delay this\ntrip save the money and proceed for the Hajj. In this way, not owing anyone\nany money.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
