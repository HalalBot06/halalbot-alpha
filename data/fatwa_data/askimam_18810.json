Jazzakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nWe are extremely saddened by the circumstances that you are faced with. We pray to Allāh Tā`la to remove the distress and problem you are currently experiencing. Aamīn.\n\n It is unclear from your statement “however he has sent me papers for English divorce” as to what you mean. It would be highly appreciated if you would forward us further details on this matter.\n\nYou have mentioned in your query that you had Istikhāra done. We understand from this that you have not done the Istikhāra yourself but, rather you have requested someone else to do it for you. It is always best to do Istikhāra yourself, as you are asking Allāh Tā`la for good in the matter which you are making Istikhāra for. \n\nInshāllah, once you have forwarded us further details, we will Inshāllah be able render further advice on the matter.\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl.
