  "question": "What is the possible type of this second knowledge. What is this referring to?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. In Sahih Bukhari Vol.1 Book #3 Hadith 121. Abu Huraira (RA) Narrates that i have received two types of Knowledge from Muhammad (Pbuh) and i have propagated only one type. If i will propagate another type of knowledge i  will b killed.\n\nWhat is the possible type of this second knowledge is this the same which the sofi's of this era claim of have possessed.\n\n2. In Surah Maidah , there is an ayah \"Qad jaaha kum minallah noorawn wa kitabum mubeen\". Some commentators say that Noor and Kitab is the same and refer to Quran. while other's say that Noor is Nabi Kareem (SW) while Kitabum Mubeen is Quran. What is the view of Ahnaf about this.\n\n3. Regarding your Futwa No. 16198, in Surah baqarah it is mentioned that one can re-marray with his divorced wife only when she will marry with another person first. If i  interpretted this aaya well , do'es it contradict with ur futwa.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1. The second type of knowledge referred to in this hadith is the knowledge acquired by Abu Huraira (radiyallaahu anhu) regarding the names of the tyrant rulers to come after the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). He feared his life in disclosing information of these tyrant rulers, for they would of killed him. Therefore, he did not disclose this knowledge to anyone. This knowledge is not possessed by the Sufis. (Fath Al-Bari, Baabu Hifzil Al-Ilm, vol 1, pg 261, Dar Al-Rayyaan)\n\n2. Both interpretations are correct. However, the second interpretation is preferred i.e ‘Noor’ refers to Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and ‘Kitaabum Mubeen’ refers to the Quran. (Tafseer Al-Razi, Sura Maidah 15, vol 6, pg 194, Dar Al-Fikr)\n\n3. The verse that appears in Sura Baqarah refers to a woman that was issued three talaaqs by her husband. Regarding her matter, the Quran mentions that she would have to marry another man before considering marriage with her former husband. Fatwa no 16198 is referring to a woman that was issued one talaaq. Therefore, there is no contradiction between the verse and the fatwa no 16198.\n\n \n\nوحمل العلماء الوعاء الذي لم يبثه على الأحاديث التي فيها تبيين أسامي أمراء السوء وأحوالهم وزمنهم ، وقد كان أبو هريرة يكني عن بعضه ولا يصرح به خوفا على نفسه (فتح الباري)\n\nثم قال تعالى : { قَدْ جَاءكُمْ مّنَ الله نُورٌ وكتاب مُّبِينٌ } وفيه أقوال : الأول : أن المراد بالنور محمد ، وبالكتاب القرآن ، والثاني : أن المراد بالنور الإسلام ، وبالكتاب القرآن . الثالث : النور/ والكتاب هو القرآن ، وهذا ضعيف لأن العطف يوجب المغايرة بين المعطوف والمعطوف عليه (تفسير الرازي)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
