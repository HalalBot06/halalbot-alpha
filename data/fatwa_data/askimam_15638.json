  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) My question is i was talking to a collegue at work, who was discussing religon with another collegue, When asking the other collegue what religon she was, She said she was a \"Hindu\", The collegue who was asking the questions, asked me was a i a \"Hindu\", I turned and said NO!!! pretty louldley, due to sound of my voice, i turned around and made a joke to ease the situation and said \"I am hindu, sikh\" ahh i'm only joking\".\n\nI am a bit worried now. I hope i have not commited Kufr.\n\n2) I am going to Turkey on the 1st September, I just want to know the Topkapi Place is stated to hold the swords, tooth, beard and other Islamic items that they called the Sacred Trust, is it authentic and is Abu Ayub Ansari buired in the Eyub Mosqu\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1) Islam has permitted the utterance of the words of kufr (disbelief) when compelled to utter these words under duress, on condition that he still. Allah Ta’ala says in the Holy Quran:\n\n\"Whoever rejects his faith in Allah after having believed in Him - not the one who is compelled (to utter a word of disbelief) under duress while his heart is at peace with Faith, but the one who has laid his breast wide open for disbelief - upon such people is the wrath of Allah, and for them there is a heavy punishment.\"\n\n(Verse: 16:106)\n\nMufti Shafi’ Saheb (Rahimahullah) explains under the commentary of this verse:\n\nFrom this verse comes the religious ruling about a person who has been compelled to utter a word of infidelity (kufr) under the threat that he would be killed if he did not do that. If he feels that, in all likelihood, the people threatening him have full capability of doing just that, then, this is a state of duress. If he were to utter some word of disbelief verbally – but with a heart firm on faith, a heart that shuns saying what is false and evil – then, there is no sin on him, nor will his wife become unlawful for him. (Qurtubi, Mazhari)\n\n(Ma’riful Quran Vol.5 Pg.417 – Maktabah Darul Uloom Karachi)\n\nIt is understood from the above mentioned that one will be regarded to be in a state of duress only when he is absolutely sure that his life is at stake. The situation mentioned in the query is not such, so it was not be permissible to utter the words of kufr in that state. Therefore, you will have to read the Kalimah again and renew your marriage, if you are married. In future, great precaution should be taken to avoid such circumstances.\n\n2) Istanbul has been the capital of the Muslim Empire for centuries, so it is highly possible that they do hold these sacred items and there is no harm in visiting this place. However, we do not have any reliable sources that confirm this information.\n\nIt is proven through reliable sources that the qrave of Abu Ayoob Ansari (Radhiyallahu Anhu) is situated in Istanbul, so there is a great possibility that he is buried close to the Ayoob Mosque.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
