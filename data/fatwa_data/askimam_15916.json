  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nto gain the reward of fasting in the month of Shawwaal (6roza's) it has to be followed by the Roza's of Ramadhaan (entire month). what is the Mas'ala regarding females that are unable to keep Roza forÂ the entire month of Ramadhaan? do they have to keep the missed Roza's of Ramadhaan first before keeping Roza's of Shawwaal or can they keep the Roza's of Shawwaal without keeping their Qaza's of Ramadhaan?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe fasts of Shawwal are mustahab. They may be kept at any time during the month of Shawwal. A woman who missed her fasts of Ramadan may make up (Qadha) for them in Shawwal or anytime during the year besides the two Eids and the 11th, 12th and 13th of Dhul Hijjah. She may keep the six fasts and then make up (Qadha) for the fasts of Ramadan.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nAskimam.org\n\n(2007-11-25)"
