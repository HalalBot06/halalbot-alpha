  "question": "If an Imam makes a mistake while reading a surah after al-Fatiha is the prayer valid? Can he start another surah? Is sajdah sahoh needed.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf an Imam makes a mistake while reading a surah after al-fatiha is the prayer valid? 1) if no one corrects him since he may know more of the Quran then them. 2) what if the mistake changes the meaning and since the Imam and followers are non-Arabic they are unaware of the meaning. 3) the Imam becomes aware of the mistake and tries to correct himself but cannot remember and none of the muqtadis is able to help. If the Imam starts reading a surah then before completing three ayats he cannot remember the next ayat. 4) Can he start another surah? Is sajdah sahoh needed. 5) If he has completed three ayats can he go into ruku after a brief pause trying to remember.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf an Imaam makes a mistake in the recitation of the Qur?aan in Salaat, he may be corrected by a Muqtadi (follower). However, if the Imaam made a mistake after reciting the minimum requirement of recitation of the Qur?aan in Salaat, he should go into Ruku and not wait for a Muqtadi to correct him.\n\nIf the Imaam make a mistake before reciting three verses, he may recite another Surah. In the above two situations, going into Ruku or reciting another Surah, the Salaat is valid and there is no Sajda-e-Sahw.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
