  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan a Muslimah not associate with any non muslims? She is divorced with kids and this is what shes been told.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are different types of association in Shari?ah. a) Mu?aamalaat (dealing), b) Muwaasaat (sympathetic), c) Mustaaraat (kind), d) Muwaalaat (hearty friendship). The first 3 types of association are permissible. The fourth type, i.e. very close relationship is strictly prohibited with a non-Muslim as there is a fear of being influenced against Islamic values and principles. And Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
