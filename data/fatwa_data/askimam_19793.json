  "question": "Can you please clarify the following verse in Surah al- Mulk?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like clarification on the Ayah in Surah al- Mulk where Allah says, “And indeed we have adorned the nearest Heaven with lamps”. According to my understanding, I know of various cases where the Heavens are either mentioned as skies or atmospheres, as well as the universe. However, I don’t seem to understand how the stars are described as being in the nearest heaven, since stars are completely out of our atmosphere.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. \n\nAs-salāmu `alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nThe verse in reference is:\n\nو لقد زينا السماء الدنيا بمصابيح و جعلناها رجوما للشياطين و اعتدنا لهم عذاب السعير\n\n \n\n \n\n “And indeed we have embellished the lowest heaven with lamps, and we have made them (to serve) as missiles to drive away the devils, and we have prepared for them the punishment of the blazing fire” (Al Qur’aan, 5:67)\n\nHaafiz Ibn Katheer (Rahmatullahi Alayhi), a great Mufassir (exegete), states that “The actual stars are not meant, rather flaming meteors/pulsars are meant which are from other sources or derived from it”.[1] \n\nThe above explanation clearly elucidates that the actual stars are not meant, rather the pulsars and meteors which emanate from them are meant.\n\nFor more details on the concept of Shooting stars, Pulsars and Meteorites, kindly refer to the following link: http://daruliftaa.net/General-Islamic/shootingstar.html\n\nAnd Allah knows best.\n\n \n\nMawlana Ismail Desai,\nDurban, South Africa\nStudent Darul Iftaa\nFaculty of speciality in Tafseer and Qura’nic sciences\n(Takhassuss Fil Tafseer)\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved \nMufti Ebrahim Desai\ndaruliftaa.net\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n1عادالضمير في قوله و جعلناها علي جنس المصابيح لا علبي عينها لانه لا يرمي بالكواكب التي في السماء بل بشهب من دونها و قد تكون مستمدة منها.تفسير ابن كثير.ص 1922/ ج 4. الفكر."
