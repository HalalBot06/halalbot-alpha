  "question": "Is the call to iqama the same as in adhan or it is different? I have recently read a hadith from Riyadh saleheen which says, in calling iqama the takbeerat, tashahudat and so on are all called once.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, the words of Iqaamat are same as the Adhaan,\nwith the addition of 'Qad qaamatis salaat' twice after 'Hayya alal falaah'.\n\nThis is substantiated by various Ahaadith found in the different books of\nHadith. Hadhrat Abdullah ibn Zayd (Radhiallaahu Anhu) said that the (word\nin) Adhaan and Iqaamat of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to\nbe in pairs (doubles).' (Tirmidhi pg.48; HM Saeed). However, the Ahaadith\nthat state the words of Iqaamat are called once only are also correct and is\nthe view of Imaam Ahmad, Maaliki and Shaafi'ee (RA) (Dars-e-Tirmidhi vol.1\npg.457)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
