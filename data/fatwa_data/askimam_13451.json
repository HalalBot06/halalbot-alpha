  "question": "1)When should we recite ayyat-ul-kursi and 33 times subhanallah, alhamdulillah and Allahuakbar after the Salat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)When should we recite ayyat-ul-kursi and 33 times subhanallah, alhamdulillah and Allahuakbar after the Salat? I mean should we recite these after the fardh or after the entire prayer (ie after praying sunnat prayers) for instance the maghrib salat, should we recite ayyat-ul-kursi and 33 times subhanallah, alhamdulillah and Allahuakbar after the 3 fardh or after the 2 nafl of maghrib? 2)I am Pakistani, and my parents taught me the \"persian\" way to read the qur'an, my parents say it is ok to read with the persian accent but I think only the arabic way to pronounce the qur'an is correct. What is your view on this? Djazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn principle, one may read the Azkaar and Ayatul Kursi immediately after the fardh salaah. However, it is better to read these Azkaar after the Sunnah Salaah. (Nurul Iddah Pg. )\n\nAllamah Jazri (R.A) states, \"It is compulsory to recite the Quraan with Tajweed\". In one Hadith Rasulullah () said, \"Recite the Quraan in the way of the Arabs\". Tajweed is to know the makhaarij (place of pronunciation) of the different letters. The recitation of the Quraan will not be correct unless the pronunciations of the letters are from the correct makhaarij. The method of pronuncitng letters in the Persian language is very much different from that of the Arabic language. It is most likely that if you read in the Persian dialect you may change the words of the Quraan thus changing the meaning of the Quraan.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
