When children are guided by their seniors, especially family members, that motivates children to do good and proper. May Allah make your brother pious and upright. May Allah grant him all the success of this world and the hereafter. Ameen. You should do the following for the proper upbringing of your brother.\n\n1. Make sure he attends a good madrassa and works hard there. Encourage him in his studies.\n2. Test him in his recitation of the Quran. Also ask him to memorize some suras and offer him gifts if he shows positive results.\n3. Ensure he learns the basic issues of Deen, Tahaarat and Salah.\n4. Observe his conduct closely. Remind him of what he learnt and encourage him to practice on it.\n5. Be strict on his five daily salah.\n6. Observe his character and conduct with his friends and correct him with love if he is rude or inappropriate in his attitude and behaviour.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
