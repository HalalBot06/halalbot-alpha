  "question": "are we allowed to eat bovine gelatine?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe permissibility of bovine gelatine depends on its manufacturing procedure. If metamorphosis takes place from collagen to gelatine, then it will be permissible.\n\nIf a metamorphosis does not take place, then the gelatine will be pure but not fit for consumption without necessity.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
