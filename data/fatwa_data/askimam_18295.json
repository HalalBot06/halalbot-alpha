  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni am a pharmacy student. For an academic study, i need to scrap out some tissues from inside of cheek area, will it violate my fast b'coz i will have to do this experiment while am fasting.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nYour fast will not break by simply scraping the cheek.  However, if this causes your cheek to bleed and the blood goes into your stomach, then your fast will break.  This is when the blood is equal to or more than your saliva, or if you can taste the blood. \n\n \n\n(أحسن الفتاوى، كتاب الصوم: 4/436؛ سعيد)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
