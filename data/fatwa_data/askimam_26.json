  "question": "What is the difference between all maslaks?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan we follow all the maslaks. If not why? please advise.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTaqleed means to follow.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta%E3la says in the Noble Qur%E3n, 'Ask the learned if you do not know'. (6:43). Since our knowledge is limited in Shari%E1h (Qur%E3n and Hadith), we are to follow the learned %DAlama i.e. to make Taqleed and be a Muqallid.%0D%0A%0D%0ABefore we introduce the book, 'Taqleed' for your reading, note the following example:%0D%0A%0D%0AA surgeon performing an operation has a choice to use several methods to perform the operation viz. Sr John, Hamiltom and Sir Conner's methods. All these methods are correct. When applied, each method (individually) have to be carried out in its entirety - the operation cannot be done by applying a little of the method of Sir John and a little of Sir Conner's and a little of Hamilton. Despite all being correct applications, only one method of application may be used for a particular operation each time. Similarly, a Muslim is required to follow one Madhab at a time so as not to confuse the%0D%0Avarious applications. It must be understood that the knowledge of the Sahaaba (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) possessed is in no comparison to ours. Hence, our understanding of the interpretations to the variations of each matter could cause immeasurable confusion. We hope by reading this booklet, you will have a clear understanding of the subject matter.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
