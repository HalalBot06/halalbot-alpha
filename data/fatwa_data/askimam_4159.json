  "question": "Assalamalaykum Dear Mufti Saab, Please tell me the virtue of reading Ayatul Karimah 1000 times a day.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhere in the Holy Quran can I find it? What Surah? Ayah and Juz #? I want to get married and have heard that praying it is a good way to get your dua's accepted. May Allah reward you for your good work. Assalamalaykum\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe reciting of any particular verse or surah of the Quran for a specific\nnumber of times is not mentioned in the Quran or the hadith. That may have\nbeen discovered through practice and experience. There is no prohibition in\nthe shariah to follow the practice and successful experiences of people\nreciting a particluar verse for a specific number of times.\n\nWe also advise you to increase the recitation of durood and salaams\n(blessings and salutations) upon Rasulullah. That has also been proven very\neffective to fulfill ones personal wishes.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
