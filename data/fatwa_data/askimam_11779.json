  "question": "1) Does Al Tauba: 77 apply to me? 2) Am I out of Allahâ€™s mercy? 3) What should I do to fix that? 4) With her intention not to pay the loan, would she be considered a thief?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nBreaking a promise with Allah. Eight years age, due to my desire not doing minors jobs any longer I used the credits card to pay for all my living expenses. Then with grace from Allah I got a job in my profession, so I started to pay off my debit and made a promise to Allah that I use the credit cards only as a method of payment. Four years ago a relative asked to borrow money from me with a promise to pay me back as soon as she gets a job. I did, but with repeated demands from her I gave her a credit card with a promise from her to pay the principle and the interest. As soon as she got a job she ran away with no word. Since a year and a half my life (from every angle) has been going down real quick. Now I have no job, no money, in debit because of that relative. After deep thought I?ve found that I broke my promise to Allah, so I asked 3 imams if it?s okay to perform the Hajj from my savings at that time (before it ran out). They said ?it?s okay? and I did. I?ve been trying to worship Allah as mush and well as I could but my life is still going from bad to worse. I am so afraid that Al Tauba: 77 applies to me. ?So He hath put as a consequence hypocrisy into their hearts, (to last) till the Day, whereon they shall meet Him: because they broke their covenant with Allah, and because they lied (again and again).?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. No, the verse does not apply to you in the context you have outlined.\n\n2. No, you are not cast out of Allah?s mercy. Do not lose hope of His mercy. One who repents is like the one who hasn?t sinned at all.\n\n3. Continue with your devotions as earnestly as you can. Your present condition may be a test from Allah. Do not allow Shaytaan to get the better of you.\n\n4. When she took the loan without intention to pay, she was in effect deceiving you. Deception is a major sin. Try to contact her and employ whatever means possible to recoup this money. May Allah make it easy for you, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
