  "question": "What is the Islamic ruling if a lady dies, and her children want to build a masjid in her name, does that count as sadaqa jaree an and does she still get hasanaat for the masjed her kids built?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nJazaak Allah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (saw) said, when a person passes away, all his actions terminate\nbut three; knowledge through which people benefit, sadaqa Jaariyya(recurring)\nand a pious child who makes dua for the parents. Building a musjid on behalf\nof the mother will certainly be sadaqa Jaariyya as people will perform salaah\nand other righteous deeds there. Your mother will be rewarded for all that,\nInsha-Allah.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
