  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow long before a namaaz has started can we pray the previous Namaaz. ie. until what time can we pray Zahur before Asr starts?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDhuhr Salaat can be performed right uptil the time of Asr Sslaat sets in.\nthis would be right uptil the end of Misl-e-Thaani (when the shadow of every\nobject is twice its length plus the shadow at time of Zawaal).\n\nHowever, one should not delay the Salaat uptil the very end of the time\nwithout excuse as this could result in missing out the Salaat altogether.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
