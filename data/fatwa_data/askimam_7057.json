  "question": "1. Is it mandatory to perform Wudhu during Ghusl or will cleansing the entire body suffice?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have the following queries regarding Ghusl: 1. Is it mandatory to perform Wudhu during Ghusl or will cleansing the entire body suffice? 2. If a person intends performing salaat immediately after Ghusl, is it necessary to perform Wudhu after Ghusl prior to performing Salaat? 3. If a person passes wind during Ghusl, does this make it necessary to perform Wudhu after Ghusl prior to performing Salaat? Jaza-ka-allah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Mustahabb (good) to make Wudhu before performing Ghusl.\n\nIf one did not make Wudhu, the Ghusl will suffice. There is no need to make Wudhu after the Ghusl is performed. If one passed wind during Ghusl, then the Wudhu will be invalidated.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
