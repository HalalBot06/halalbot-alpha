  "question": "What should a Muslim family do if their daughter runs away?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat should a muslim family do if their daughter runs away. This daughter ran away once before, and then was convinced to return. However now she ran away again, this time because she states she wants to be free. Also she is in \"love\" with an american male. We don't know the extent of this relationship. Under islamic law should she be punished?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0AThe matter you have referred to is of a very delicate nature. The question%0D%0Aof her being punished will not be applicable. In an un-Islamic state where%0D%0Awestern concepts of equality and immorality is rife, wisdom and diplomacy%0D%0Awill have to be implemented.%0D%0A%0D%0AFirstly, turn to Allah Ta'ala and ask His assistance. Try to obtain more%0D%0Ainformation concerning her ideologies. What does she mean she wants to be%0D%0Afree? What has initiated the idea? Is there someone pressurising her? Is she%0D%0Ain love with someone? What is the extent of the relationship?%0D%0A%0D%0ATry to use one of her friends and confidants to obtain the information you%0D%0Aneed. Corporal punishments in this case will only add fuel to the fire.%0D%0AInstead of gaining closer to her, Allah Ta'ala forbid, you may lose her.%0D%0AThis may be hard on you but you have no alternative. Try to arrange a%0D%0Ameeting with her, convince her this time you will not scold her or reprimand%0D%0Aher, you would only like to talk to her. Show her that you really love her.%0D%0AIn this meeting, tell her to be open minded. Give her the chance to speak%0D%0Aher heart out (not hiding anything from you).%0D%0A%0D%0AMany youngsters have a barrier with their parents. They cannot express%0D%0Athemselves with them. Allah willing in this meeting, you will have an idea%0D%0Aof what are her thoughts and desires. Explain to her that the reason for%0D%0Ayour concern is the mere fact that you love her, you have feeling for her,%0D%0Ayou care for her well-being. Explain to her that being free and feminism is%0D%0Aan unnatural, artificial and abnormal product of modern day disintegration%0D%0Awhich in turn is the inevitable result of the rejection of all moral and%0D%0Aspiritual values.%0D%0A%0D%0AConvince her that being free is an abnormal way to be adopted by a female.%0D%0AAll human cultures make a clear cut distinction between 'masculinity' and%0D%0A'feminity'. The social role for men and women are different. Explain to her%0D%0Athat she is still young she has a life in front of her. She is only a screen%0D%0Athat Shaytaan has placed in front of her eyes. She should not be deceived by%0D%0AShaytaan. Does she really want to sacrifice her family for her freedom? What%0D%0Ais freedom? Islam and the teaching of our beloved Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) in the real sense is freedom. If you follow the western way of%0D%0Alife, there is really no freedom.%0D%0A%0D%0ATake a look around yourself, the Americans, for example, 'they do what they%0D%0Alike, eat what they feel like, promiscuous society.' 'If you really ask%0D%0Athem, 'how is life', they will answer very difficult.' Now stop for a%0D%0Asecond. Look around yourself. Do you really want this type of freedom (which%0D%0Aby the way is limited). Are you really ready for such a type of a life. Will%0D%0Ayou be able to cope out there all by yourself. If you are doing this all%0D%0Abecause you fell in love with a man, think is it really love or illusion?%0D%0AHow well do you know him? Is he a Muslim? How is his behaviour and habit,%0D%0Aetc?%0D%0A%0D%0Aa) These are just guidelines, you will have to take things step by step.%0D%0Ab) Do not haste in your method.%0D%0Ac) Make lots of Du'aas. Allah Ta'ala only is the changer of hearts.%0D%0Ad) Be very loving and caring towards her. Make her feel that she is really a%0D%0Apart of the family and her absences are really being felt.%0D%0Ae) Start reading the Fadhaail-e-Aamaal in the home collectively if you are%0D%0Anot reading. This Kitaab has proved very beneficial to people.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
