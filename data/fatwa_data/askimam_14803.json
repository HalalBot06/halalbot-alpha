  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is the ruling regarding the adhaan of such a person who sells alcohol in his shops? The situation is that we have a man who sells alcohol and calls out the adhaan on a regular basis. Many mussallis are not pleased with this at all. In the light of the Quran and Sunnah, what is the status of this, and what action must be taken?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are two issues to this query\n• Qualities of a Mua’zzin\n• Validity of the Azaan\nAccording to Shariah, it is Mustahab (preferable) for the Mua’zzin to be pious and Allah fearing. Rasulullah (Sallahu Alayhi Wasallam) said \"The best among you should call out the Azaan and the most learned among you should lead the Salaah\" (Tahtaawi Pg. 197). A person involved in buying and selling of alcohol openly is a Faasiq (sinner).The Azaan of a Faasiq is Makrooh (reprehensible) (Tahtaawi Pg. 200).\nIf a Faasiq calls out the Azaan, it is even advisable to repeat the Azaan (Ibid).\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
