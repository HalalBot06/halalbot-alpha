  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ncan u fully explain in detail how to write sourat bani israeel with saffron and what would be a suitable material for writing with.  Also i was wondering if there are any other methods of reducing a stutter such as duas, reading nafl, darood shareef or  methods like the one above??\n\nJazakallah for taking the time to answer my question\n\nmay Allah reward you for all your hard work  in this life and the hereafter and give you the taufeeq in continung to benefit the muslim ummah.\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAt the outset it is important to understand that the method of writing with saffron is not proven from Shariah. It is based on the experiences of the pious and righteous. Although the method is very effective, it should not be considered as part of Deen. The method of writing Surah Bani Israe’el with saffron is to take a toothpick and write the surah on 40 plates.\n\nTo remove your stammer recite durood a lot and recite the verses 25-28 of Surah Taha in the 16th Juz of the Quraan after every fardh Salaah.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
