  "question": "Can I do Electrical/Electronic engineering after which I may be employed for making Television sets, cameras, etc.?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have some questions regarding various careers: 1) Can I do electrical/electronic engineering after which I may be employed for design and manufacture of Television set, cameras, and other machines involving pictures? 2) If I choose Mechanical engineering, I may be employed for design and manufacture of cars and other vehicles, which produce harmful gases when their fuel burns? 3) I have heard that we must not try to know what Allah has made secret, e.g.: palmistry, predictions, etc. Then can we study Chemistry and Biology in which a student goes into the matter to the molecular level, and study about things such as, electron, atoms, heart, etc. Weren?t these things hidden and we were told not to try to know that Allah has kept secret? I am looking forward to your sincere advice on choosing a career.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Electrical engineering is a very vast field. It encompasses many varieties of electrical work other than designing and manufacturing of televisions and cameras such as heavy and domestic electrical work, designing and manufacturing other electrical appliances, etc. Therefore it will be permissible to study electrical engineering. %0D%0A%0D%0A2. It is also permissible to study mechanical engineering because cars fall under the basic necessities of life and the mere fact that they produce harmful gases will not be the cause of its prohibition. %0D%0A%0D%0A3. Chemistry and Biology has no link with palmistry and predictions. Chemistry and Biology is studied through the usage of apparatus while palmistry and predictions is a delusion which has no basis in Shariah, therefore it will be erroneous to compare Biology and Chemistry to palmistry and it will be permissible to study Biology and Chemistry and not palmistry. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Ashraf%0D%0ADarul Ifta ?
