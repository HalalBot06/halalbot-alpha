  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala says, 'Do not go even close to Zina (adultery)'.\n\nIntermingling of sexes is Haraam and it is not permissible for a male to\nhave a female friend and hang out with her even if the intention is to know\nher for marriage. There is a strong possibility that free and loose\nfriendship may lead to an illicit relationship as is common in environments\nof intermingling of sexes, for example, universities, offices, etc.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
