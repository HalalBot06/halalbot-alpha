  "question": "Is it ok to do masah over tights, one piece undergarment garment covering from feet to waist for women, as it is inconvenient to take off tights whenever doing wudhoo, please clarify.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the tights are thin and water easily seeps through them, and the feet are washed, then that is sufficient.\n\nIt is not permissible to merely make Masah on the tights. If the tights are thick and water cannot seep through easily, then the tights have to be removed and the feet have to be washed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
