  "question": "if man and woman celebrate their Nikah and after that celebrate their marrige with sitting together infront of people?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis is an act of imitation of the Kuffaar. The Hadith mentions that whoever\nimitates a nation will be considered one of them.\n\nThe Qur'aan strictly commands that women should observe Hijaab (seclusion)\nfrom strange men. This is obviously absent in such a wedding. Thus, this\ntype of wedding celebration is not permissible in Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
