  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Can a wife call her husband by his name if he does not mind? What does Islam say about this? 2. I know that women can only trim her hair from the bottom, to eliminate 2 heads. But my question is if I can cut it from the front. I do not have much hair on the front of my head. It makes me look older then I really am, plus I cannot make any good styles from the front. I would like to know if I can cut long bangs up to my chin. I wear hijab when I go outside; I want to do this for my husband. 3. I heard that you can pray two nafals for your deceased parents to protect them from azaba kabar. Is this permissible? 4. is your brother inlaw, sisters husbad a non-mehram? How much parada must we make from him? I heard he is a arzi-mehram, and a girl can go with him for hajh, if the sister accompanies them. If that is the case, then the parade from him should not be that strict.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Generally, there is nothing wrong as long as his respect for him remains. The respect that a wife should show to her husband has been emphasized to such an extent that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?If (it was permissible), I would have commanded the wife to bow down to their husband.? (Sunan Tirmidhi; this Hadith has been classified as authentic by Imaam Tirmidhi)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. A woman may not cut%2Ftrim her hair even if her husband commands her to do so. (Shaami vol.6 pg.407) If she does so, she will draw the wrath of Almighty Allah as well as the curse of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) upon himself due to her imitating men. (Sahih Bukhari Hadith5885)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. It is permissible to perform Nafl deeds and ask Allah to accept them and convey the rewards to one?s parents. (Shaami vol.1 pg.667)%0D%0A%0D%0A4. He is a non-Mahram and complete Purdah should be made from him. Nowadays many people are laxed in this regard.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desaiq"
