  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy husband bought a perfume for his mother who was in her country and tried to send it by mail\n\n1) My husband bought a perfume as a gift for his mother who was in her country and tried to send it by mail but was not able to do so due to restrictions by post office. He, however had informed his mother that he has purchased a perfume for her and would give it to her when she comes here. When she came to visit us, I reminded my husband in front of my mother-in-law to give the perfume to his mother but he said that she has stopped using alcoholic perfumes so there is no use in giving it to her now. My question is that since it was initially purchased with the intention of giving it to her and she was even informed about it, does that make the perfume 'her property', and is it necessary for anybody else to ask for her permission before using that perfume? That perfume is now lying idle as my mother-in-law went back to her country.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe perfume in question still belongs to your husband as it was not handed over into the ownership of his mother. Therefore, he may do with it as he deems fit.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
