  "question": "For how many days on a journey is a person regarded as a traveller/musaffir?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nFor how many days on a journey is a person regarded as a traveller/musaffir?\n\nDoes a person have the choice to read the complete rakaats of salaah if classified as a travelller/musaffir (example 12 rakaats of zuhr or  2)?\n\nIf a woman is having haidth on departure of her journey and she makes ghusl a few days after arrival at her destination is she also regarded as a musaffir or not if she stays the required number of days as a musaffir?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. If a person undertakes a journey of 88 kms or more, the person will become a Musaafir.\n\n2. If a person stays in one place for lesser than 15 nights at one place after undertaking a journey of 88 kms or more, then the person will be a Musaafir. If he intends staying for 15 nights or more at one place, then he will be a Muqeem.\n\n3. A Musaafir is required to read 2 Rakaats Fardh Salaat in Dhurh, Asr and Esha. He/she may read the Sunnat Salaats before and after the different Salaats.\n\n4. The distance covered during haydh will not be considered. The distance will be calculated only once she finishes her haydh. If she reached her destination and still had her haydh, she will be regarded a Muqeem and will have to perform her full Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
