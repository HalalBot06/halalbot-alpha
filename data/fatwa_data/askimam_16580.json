  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am in a situation where the girl's mother is not agreeing to our marriage. We have tried everything possible but she is still not doing anything.\nWe did istikhara and it came out positive for both of us.\nWhat I want to know is that if we do nikah, just to tell her that \"Yes we can take this step\"(which she thinks we will not), would it be possible to do nikah twice for the sake of other people?\nWhat I am saying is that we plan to do nikah and tell her mother. If she agrees to it after we do nikah then we would just pretend to have a nikah infront of all the relatives (I belong to Pakistan so there is mehndi, nikah/barat and walima functions). more importantly, I don't want to keep on committing sin by talking to her in the meanwhile and by doing nikah, I would not be doing anything wrong.\n\nWould that be possible, i.e. we do nikah twice?\n\nJazakAllah khair.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nWhat if the girlâ€™s mother does not agree to the nikah? Will you divorce her? Will she spend iddat? Will she marry someone else and will she be honest to say that she was married previously?\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
