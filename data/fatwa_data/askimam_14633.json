If so the bleeding will be Istihaada. You should fast and perform your Salah. You should make Fardh Wudhu for each Fardh Salah. You can also recite the Quran with that Wudhu.     \n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
