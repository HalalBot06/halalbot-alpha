  "question": "Some bad thoughts requires that the person should recite his Kalimah over. If a person has such a bad thought before/while a good deed, can he first finish the deed then recite his Kalimah over?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nA virtuous: such as performing wudu or making salaah. Another question: How can a person suppress or get rid of bad thoughts while doing a virtuous deed. Or is suppressing a thought a way of get rid of bad thoughts while performing a virtuous deed?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The fact that a person feels guilty about the evil thoughts is an\nindication of his firm faith. This being the case, there is no need to\nrecite the Kalimah. However, the frequent recitation of the Kalimah is a\nvirtuous deed recommended for refreshing one's Imaan. You may also recite,\n'A'oodhu billaahi minas shaytaanir rajeem' and 'Laa hawla walaa quwwata\nillaa billaah' when confronted with evil thoughts.\n\n\n2. Instead of suppressing these evil thoughts, think positively and direct\nyour attention to something else.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
