  "question": "We know that when Allah SWT introduced Hazrat Adam to all the Malaikah and ask them to bow him then Iblis refused to bow. This act was certainly an act of evil in itself. And we know that for all the evil deeds it is Iblis who diverts the attention.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalam-o-Alaikum,\n\nI have the following questions.\n\n1) We know that when Allah SWT introduced Hazrat Adam to all the Malaikah and ask them to bow him then Iblis refused to bow. This act was certainly an act of evil in itself.  And we know that for all the evil deeds it is Iblis who diverts the attention. Then why did Iblis act in such an evil way. Who made him act in such an evil way considering he was among the most obedient of Malaikah.\n\n2) I live in Germany where I pray in Turkish mosque. During Friday Khutba, the Imam recites verses from Holy Quran as well as add something in Turkish language. Is it right to deliver friday khutba in any other language than Arabic?\n\n3) Moreover, when I don't understand Turkish language part, can I make Zikr (Durood Shareef etc) as I think it might not be correct to make zikr during Khutba and one should listen to Imam during this time.\n\nPlease guide. Jazak Allah\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n1)     Iblis is a Jinn and not an angel. He has the ability to understand right from wrong. Whatever he does, it is through his choice and therefore he will be punished. He was included amongst the angels because of his worship. He fell from that position because of disobeying the orders of Allah and displaying pride because of his worship. To obey the order of Allah is superior to any voluntary worship.\n\n \n\n \n\n2)     If the khutbah has verses of the Quran, it will be valid. If you cannot go to another Masjid where the khutbah is in the full Arabic, then you will be excused.\n\n \n\n \n\n3)     You should listen to the khutbah and don’t engage in any Zikr at that time.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout the day streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM"
