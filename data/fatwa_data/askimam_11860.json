The Qur?aan and Shari?ah are till the day of Qiyaamat. Therefore, the orders therein will apply till then. May Allah instill the love of Nabi [Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam] in us all.%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Since you are from Pakistan, we encourage you to take the opportunity and sit in the company of the Ulama and the pious. We don?t know exactly where in Pakistan you are from, otherwise we would furnish the names of Ulama,%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Read books which deal with the Seerah of Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam]%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Yes, it is possible to understand that the Sunnah is very easy to implement. Basically, do your daily activities according to the Sunnah, i.e. eating, sleeping, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Yes, there are four. Sit in the company of the pious. Similarly, one should realise the greatness of Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] and his status before Allah. Today, we look up to the sporstars, etc. because we seem to regard them as great and keep the sacrifices of Rasulullah [Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam] before us and all the things he did for you and i.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Use wisdom and kind words. Most importantly, one should be soft. Do not be hasty in achieving your goal, i.e. don?t expect them to change immediately. Persevere, tell them of the virtues on practising on the Sunnah. Take them for talks of deen. Read the Ahaadith of Rasulullah [Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam] daily.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. Shamaail Kubra%0D%0A%0D%0A7. Understand that once a person makes tawbah, i.e. repents of his sins, then Allah forgives all his sins. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
