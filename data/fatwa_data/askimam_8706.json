  "answer": "QUESTION\nI read that you have quoted that our prophet said \"That every relation whether it be direct or indirect will be of no benefit on the Day of Judgement except for the ones related to me\". Could you please eloborate on this. Whats the context in which our prophet said this. Did he mean that people belonging to his family shall be subject to a special treatment on the day of judgement(eg. they could be pardoned for their sins on that day just because they are form his family etc.).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis Hadith has been reported by various Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhu) and is an authentic Hadith. (Tabaqaat al-Shaafi?yyah)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is reported that after marrying the daughter of Sayyiduna Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu) (Umm Kulthum), he said, ?Wont you all congratulate me? Verily, I have heard Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) saying, ?On the day of Qiyaamat, every relationship will be cut off except my relationship.? (Majmauz-zawaid vol.9 pg.173)%0D%0A%0D%0AHafiz al-Haythami (RA) has classified all its narrators as authentic. (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe meaning of this Hadith is that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) will, on the day of the judgment, make a special intercession on behalf of his family members that were Muslim. And this will only be through the permission of Almighty Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0AA similar meaning is understood from a narration of Sahih Bukhari, wherein Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) asked his beloved Uncle, Abu-Taalib, at the time of his death to recite the Kalimah so that he may plead to Allah on his behalf on the day of Qiyaamat. Those and other Ahaadith denote that there will be some kind of special intercession made on behalf of the family of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0AAllaamah Suyyooti (RA) has recorded this as a speciality afforded by Allah Ta?ala to Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).
