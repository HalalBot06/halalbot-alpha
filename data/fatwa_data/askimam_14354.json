  "question": "I do want to show them that I love and respect them and their traditions. Is the Tasbih the best choice?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a question regarding the Tasbih.  I am a Christian and my former husband's father is in the hospital after a bad accident.  He is 90 years old and not expected to survive very long.\n\nAs he lives in Tehran and I am here, I cannot go to him.  My ex husband received great comfort from the Tasbih he carried around with him.  My thought is to send his father a handmade set of Tasbih.  Is this appropriate?  In my Christian customs, burying something of sentimental value with the body is a sign of love. \n\nI never want to offend these dear people, but I do want to show them that I love and respect them and their traditions.  Is the Tasbih the best choice?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe hope you well.\n\nIt is encouraging to note that you have taken interest in Islam. We hope and pray that Allah guides you to the truth. Ameen\n\nYou may send the Tasbih to your ex in-laws as a token of love and relation. We also urge you to read the translation of the Quraan.\n\nYou may contact us if you have any queries regarding Islam. We will gladly assist you in this regard.\n\nThank you\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai\nChecked and Approved\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
