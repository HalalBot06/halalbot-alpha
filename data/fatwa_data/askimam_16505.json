  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan we have intercourse after confirmation of pregnancy coz i have heard from some ppl that intercourse is not aloowed for the first 4 month of pregnancy as well as When should we stop intercourse in pregancy ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIntercourse during pregnancy is based on the wellbeing of the wife and child. Therefore, if it will cause harm to the wife or child then one should refrain from intercourse during pregnancy. The gynaecologist will be able to advise on that.\n\nالفتاوى المحمودية 18/633 جامعة فاروقية\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Ishaq E.
