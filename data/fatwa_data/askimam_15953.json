  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissible for women to go masjid?if not then why can they go for taleem and bayaans?if there is fitna then why can they go malls, schools , university etcHAZRAT AISHA RA said that if NABI SAW was alive he would prohibit it . but NABI (SAW) was not alive so he did not prohibit it . so it should be permisssible\n\nCan women go qabrastaan and why? HAZRAT AISHA RA  visited her brothers qabar\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh  \n\n1.         Nowadays, due to the intensity of the fitnah-prevailing conditions, she is not allowed to go to the musjid.\n\n\n2.         Some ulama have permitted them to attend taleem and bayaans etc out of necessity. Furthermore, taleem normally takes place in a home, so the fitnah is reduced. However, if there is fitnah in this as well, she will be prohibited. The same applies to malls, schools etc.\n\n\n3.         She mentioned this thirteen hundred years ago. Any intelligent person can ascertain the level of prohibition for himself in this era of vice and spiritual corruption.\n\n\n4.         No, Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) prohibited women from attending the graveyard. \n\n\n\n\nAnd Allah knows best"
