  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nwhat is the limit of allah's forgiveness\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nAllah Ta’ala’s forgiveness in the hereafter is limited to all forms of sins, major and minor. The forgiveness of Allah Ta’ala does not extend to the crime of Kufr, Shirk, and issues pertaining to the rights of human beings. However, in this world, if a person commits any form of sin, including Kufr and Shirk and he sincerely repents, he will be forgiven by Allah Ta’ala.The forgiveness of Allah Ta’ala is never-ending as long as one is pure and sincere in his/her Tawbah from the sin. When one commits a sin and repents with sincerity to Allah Ta’ala he must have full conviction that his forgiveness is accepted. Allah Ta’ala says in the Quran:\n\nقُلْ يَا عِبَادِيَ الَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُوا عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ لا تَقْنَطُوا مِن رَّحْمَةِ اللَّهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ جَمِيعًا إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ.(الزمر، 53)\n\nSay: “O My slaves who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah: verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”(Quran 39: 53)\n\nThus, informing His servants that He is willing to forgive all sins one commits and not to despair on the forgiveness of Allah Ta’ala.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
