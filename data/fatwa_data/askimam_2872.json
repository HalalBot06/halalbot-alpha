  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Sahab, Can we greet with Salaam while picking up the telephone? what if the caller is non-muslim? If we unknowingly greet with Salaam to a non-muslim, are we sinner. Can we greet with Salaam to Shia'h or other related sects and if they greet us with Salaam can we reply. Jazak Allah Khair. Was Salaam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen one receives a telephone call, it is advisable not to respond with Salaam until one is sure that the caller is a Muslim. If a non-Muslim greet\nwith Salaam, we should reply by saying, 'Salaamun `Alaa manittaba`a al Hudaa\n' (May Salaam be upon those who follow guidance).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
