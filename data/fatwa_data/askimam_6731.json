  "answer": "QUESTION\nNow that I have grown up and have a reasonable job, I can easily support her. Should I give in charity, the amount of money she had used from the scheme, or her repentance in front of Allah would be enough to save her from the azab of akhirah? 2) What should be done of the money which is still in the bank/scheme? 3) I have made intention to spend a decent %age of my salary for Mujahideen. As I would be having enough money by next year to perform Hajj, which should be my 1st,2nd and 3rd obligation among Hajj, funds for Mujahideen, and paying back the interest? 4) Referring to question 6588, is live video(unrecorded) allowed, on TV or conferencing? 5) Is it allowed to pray behind Ihl-e-Hadith? One who accepts Quran and Hadith but rejects Ijma and Qayas, can he be called a non-muslim?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Since it was your grandmother and not you, you are under no obligation to\ngive that amount in charity. However, if you do wish to give it on her\nbehalf, you may do so. Also, irrespective of who pays the amount in charity\nrepentance is also a condition. She was engaged in interest and this is a\nmajor sin hence, Tawbah or repentance is necessary.\n2. The money that was originally deposited, i.e. the capital sum, is Halaal.\nThe rest of it is Haraam. since she has used money from the account, we\nwould assume that the Halaal portion of the money is depleted. The account\nmay be closed altogether or placed in a non-interest generating account.\n3. Your first obligation is Hajj. Thereafter, you may spend on the\nMujaahideen or upon your grandmother's interest.\n4. Kindly resubmit your question and also question 6588\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim D"
