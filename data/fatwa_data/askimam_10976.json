  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy daughter has a very bad temper and can be rebellious and disobedient. I?m afraid for her future. She is only two years old. I am desperately unhappy with this situation. Her baby brother is starting to learn the same actions. I am starting to believe temper is inherited from their father. Please also give me a dua to make my family life blissful and peaceful.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakummulah Khair for your question. %0D%0A%0D%0A\"Do not despair in the Mercy of Allah Ta'ala.\" Firstly make dua after every salaah for Allah Ta'ala to make your children the \"coolness of your eyes\" with good character. Also assess your situation. Rebelloius behaviour is a means of expressing young children's emotions. They are unable to express their feelings - Consider your 2 year old child - suddenly has to share their mums attention with the new sibling. It could even be a means of attention seeking. Also two children revolving around husband , house leaves no time for yourself. Hence can cause moods, irritation, frustration. Hence Relax! %0D%0A%0D%0ATake matters as they come Make time for yourself ist health, vitamins, exercise. With a sound mind and body, it is easier to handle situations and responsibilities. Then adopt quality time even 1%2F2 hour to your child, reading, talking playing. Then involve your child in activities involving baby - little errands making her feel important. After making efforts and dua resign the will to Allah Ta'ala. Whatever the circumstances Most certainly after difficulty comes ease.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best.%0D%0A%0D%0A2Social Dept.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
