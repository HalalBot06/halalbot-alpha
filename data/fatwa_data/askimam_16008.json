  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI always miss my asar salath while comming back from office to home. I use Bus for conveyance and Quibla falls toaward right of the seat. how should I make up for this. I greatly regret leaving the namaz but I dont find the way. Please sugest if any way is there.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nDiscarding Salaah without any valid reason is a grave sin. Consider the following Ahadith:\n\nعن ابن عمر أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال « الذى تفوته صلاة العصر كأنما وتر أهله وماله » .\n\nIt has been narrated on the authority of Abdullah ibn Umar (Radhiyallahu Anhu) that Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) said, “The person who has missed his Asr Salaah is as if though all his family and wealth have been destroyed”.\n\n(Sahih Al Bukhari Vol.1 Pg.156 – Darul Fikr)\n\nسمعت جابرا يقول سمعت النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول « إن بين الرجل وبين الشرك والكفر ترك الصلاة ».\n\nIt has been narrated on the authority of Jabir (Radhiyallahu Anhu) that he heard Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) saying, “Discarding out Salaah leads one to kufr and shirk”.\n\n(Sahih Muslim Vol.1/2 Pg.257 – Darul Ma’rifah)\n\nعن عبد الله بن بريدة عن أبيه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم « العهد الذى بيننا وبينهم الصلاة فمن تركها فقد كفر ».\n\nIt has been narrated on the authority of Buraidah (Radhiyallahu Anhu) that Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) said, “The pledge between the infidels and us is Salaah, and whoever leaves it out has left the fold of Islam”.\n\n(Jami’ Al Tirmizi Vol.2 Pg.90 – H.M. Sa’eed Company)\n\nIn the light of the abovementioned, it will not be permissible to leave out Salaah intentionally due to worldly engagements. Man has been sent to this world to prepare for the Hereafter; therefore, the obligations of Deen should be given first priority.\n\nIt is not permissible to perform fardh (obligatory) Salaah whilst sitting in the bus. Those who are forced to perform Salaah in the bus due to unavoidable circumstances can perform Salaah whilst sitting in the bus, but will have to repeat it after they get off the bus.\n\n(Imdadul Fatawa Vol.1 Pg.393/4 – Maktabah Darul Uloom Karachi)\n(Fatawa Uthmani Vol.1 Pg.401 – Maktabah Ma’ariful Quran, Karachi)\n\nHowever, it will not be permissible to make a daily habit of performing Salaah whilst sitting in the bus. You should try to adjust your schedules and make arrangements to perform your Asr before leaving for home, or make arrangements to reach home before the time of Asr expires. You will also have to make qadha of all the Salaahs that were missed and repent sincerely to allah Ta’ala.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
