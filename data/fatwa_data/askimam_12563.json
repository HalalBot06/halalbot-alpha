  "question": "Are we restricted to choosing names with only good Muslim meanings or can we also accept a general good meaning, like for example in the English or Malay languages?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is narrated in a Hadith that: ?You will be called by your name and your father?s name on the Day of Qiyaamah, therefore you should keep good names.? (Sunan Abi Dawood, Vol. 2, Page 320) By good name it is meant that such names should be kept that have excellent meanings and pronouncing them should also be easy so that people when pronouncing it will not change its pronunciation in any way. It should also be borne in mind that when the name is transliterated into English, etc such letters should be used that will bring it close to the way it is pronounced in that language.\n\nKeeping these points mind one can derive that a name can be chosen from any language but Arabic names are much better to keep as the Islamic character becomes apparent on its own.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf\nDARUL IFTA ?
