  "question": "if a woman does not marry throughout her life (for whatever reason) and does not commit illegal sexual intercourse with anyone throughout her life, would she still marry in paradise",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know that if a woman does not marry throughout her life (for whatever reason) and does not commit illegal sexual intercourse with anyone throughout her life, would she still marry in paradise if it were her wish to? If so, who would she be married to?\n\nIf an unmarried woman is unable to find a suitable spouse to support her in her faith, but would like to still have children as years are passing by - is it permissible for her to adopt? Until she does find someone suitable?\n\nPlease can you advise\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Yes, she will marry in Jannah – if she so wishes. Allah Ta’ala will either get her married to a Muslim who remained a bachelor in this world or He will create a husband for her.\n\n2. Yes, she may adopt a child but the child will not be regarded as her child. In other words, laws pertaining to inheritance, etc. will not apply. She will merely be regarded as a guardian of the child. Islam does not recognise adoption in the manner it is recognised by the secular courts of today. Furthermore, as a word of advice, a female child will be preferable in her case. This will ensure that the laws of Hijaab do not preclude her relationship with the child once the child reaches puberty.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
