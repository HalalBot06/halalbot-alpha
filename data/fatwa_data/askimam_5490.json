  "answer": "QUESTION\nsalaams moulana, jazaklaah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlmighty Allah Ta%E3la states in the Noble Qur%E3n, 'O` you who believe!! Obey%0D%0AAllah and His Rasul'.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe life of the Prophet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) is indeed the best%0D%0Aexample for us to follow. During the time of the Prophet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam) many of his family members, his wives, daughters, uncles and his%0D%0Aillustrious companions left the world whilst engaged in the most noble work%0D%0Aand effort of uplifting the religion of Islam. Despite the Prophet's deep%0D%0Alove for them, he did not (on any single occasion) commemorate the%0D%0Ainnovative custom of 7 days, 40 days, 100 days, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Hadith is clear, in that, the immediate family should mourn for three%0D%0Adays. There is no basis in the Shari%E1h to commemorate any Muslim's death at%0D%0Aintervals of 7 days, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is not exactly clear as to the source of celebrating forty days after%0D%0Adeath. We, as Muslims, follow the Noble Qur%E3n and the life model of our%0D%0Abeloved Rasul (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
