  "question": "should we as Muslims still keep minimum insurance, i.e. third party car insurance",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI live in the US State of Michigan. In this state car insurance is a little different from other states. If someone hits your car then no matter who is at fault each person must get money from his own insurance company. For example if I have minimum insurance and someone hits my car then even though it is his fault my insurance will not pay me anything(apart from medical costs if required) because I have the minimum insurance ie third party. In this kind of situation should we as Muslims still keep minimum insurance.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOne will be excused for taking out a third insurance policy if there is no\nother way to claim for the damage done to one's car.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
