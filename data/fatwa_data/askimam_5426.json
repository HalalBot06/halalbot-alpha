There is a Hadith that if a person recites the beginning and ending%0D%0Aportions of Surah Kahf, he will be filled with Noor from head to toe.%0D%0A2. If a person mocks and ridicules at any fundamental part of Islam, then he%0D%0Awill become a Kaafir. The words here, 'Why do we have to read Salaat . its%0D%0Ahard' will not be considered as mocking and criticizing.%0D%0A3. There is no need to make Niyyat verbally in a loud voice. Niyyat in the%0D%0Aheart is sufficient. If a person constantly makes his Niyyat aloud, then it%0D%0Acan be termed as Bid'at.%0D%0A4. Arshiyyah is probably derived from the word 'Arsh' which means a roof,%0D%0Acanopy or throne. However, it is not an appropriate name.%0D%0A5. There is nothing wrong with this.%0D%0A6. No, there is no specific way to go about washing any new item.%0D%0A7. It is not permissible to abuse funds given to one by the government. If%0D%0Athe funds given to one were given for a specific purpose, then to use it for%0D%0Aany other purpose will be abuse, hence, not permissible.%0D%0A8. We have not come across any Hadith that signifies the virtue of reading%0D%0ASurah Rahmaan daily.%0D%0A9. Yes.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
