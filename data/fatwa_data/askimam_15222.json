  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWe as muslims use shamposs and lotions regularly.Bulk, in fact 90% of them have an ingredient called cetyl alcohol\n\nQuestion:Does our state automatically become napaak when using this?Is our ibaadat accepted?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAs a principle, alcohol derived from grapes and dates are not permissible.  Alcohol which comes from sources other than these two and do not intoxicate is permissible. Cetyl Alcohol is originally derived from sperm whale oil and in modern day it is derived from coconut oil or may be synthetically produced.  It is not an intoxicant, therefore it will be clean and not considered to be impure.  One will not become impure using products that contain cetyl alcohol. The Ibadat performed with these products is valid.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMl. Ehzaz Ajmeri,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
