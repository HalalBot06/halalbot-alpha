  "question": "Will Christians and Jews go to heaven?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have read that non-Muslims will all enter hell. Is this true or false. I know some really nice non-Muslims but seeing that they will enter hell doesn't seem right. Or am I wrong?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe fundamental requirement to enter into Jannat is accepting the Oneness of Allah and finality of the Prophethood of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam). Non-Muslims will be rewarded in this world for their good deeds or alternatively the punishment in the hereafter will be decreased for them as will be the case with the Uncle of Rasulullah, Abu Talib, who protected him as safeguarded Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) from the harms of the disbelievers.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
