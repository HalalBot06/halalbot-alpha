  "question": "My wife tried but not that hard and said if she did not go with her mother, her mother would kill herself. My wife’s mother I must mention thought that doing Kitchen work and keeping an eye on servants was a cruelty and that her daughter (my wife) was not supposed to cook",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDear Imam Sahib,\n\n \n\nThis is in continuation to Fatwa # 14660 where I had asked you if I should leave my wife because my wife demanded that she be allowed to work. I had forgotten to mention one important thing. I had just stopped my wife from giving one interview and told her that I would allow her to work only after our daughter was at least one year old. I told her that that interview was not the end of the world and that she would get many more chances in future to pursue her career. I just told her that for now I did not see how she would manage both home and work. She had agreed not to give interview but to her parents that was not acceptable. They said that if I did not allow her to give interview, they would take her with them. I asked my wife to persuade her parents not to interfere and should ask them not to come to take you away from me. My wife tried but not that hard and said if she did not go with her mother, her mother would kill herself. My wife’s mother I must mention thought that doing Kitchen work and keeping an eye on servants was a cruelty and that her daughter (my wife) was not supposed to cook and instead be working and servants should do all the work. My wife also held the same views. It was because of that attitude of her and her mother that I stopped my wife from working for the time being until I saw that she could manage the house well. My mother did all the grocery shopping and also dealt with the servants. My wife only had to cook which she thought of as a burden. Now after your previous fatwa when I told my mother I still wanted to keep my wife, she said she would kill herself if I brought her back in my life. She even took sleeping pills and attempted suicide. My sisters also said that they would cut-off all relations with me if I kept any relation with my wife. Now I am also thinking if it is worth it to keep my wife who has been disobedient to me many times and also told me once in anger that she didn’t want any more children from me. She is also not very good at managing household work. And most of all if she could leave me saying that if she did not do so, her mother would kill herself then why can’t I leave her for the same reason that my mother would most probably commit suicide because she can’t live with my wife and also can’t leave me. My wife now says she still loves me and wants to live with me but of course without my mother which is impossible, and also on the condition that the decision whether she would work or not would be entirely hers with no say of mine. As for leaving her in Hyderabad with my mother, it is because of our financial conditions as I have to marry-off my youngest sister for which I need to save money. I live in a single room in Karachi and told my wife that as soon as my sister was married after two or three months we would move to Karachi as right now I can’t afford an apartment in Karachi . But she was impatient. We have been married for only 11 months. I also did istakhara after your fatwa and it was not in favor of my wife. I don't want to do any injustice as I fear Allah alot. What should I do?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\n \n\nYou state you made Istikhaara. You may follow the guidance of the Istikhaara.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\nThe guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\nEducation and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\nIslam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\nWhen one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\nMuslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\nWe have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\nIf you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\nIf that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\nRasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit”.\n\n \n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUT INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
