  "question": "What is the reward for looking at the Kaaba, and for someone who does not have the luxury of visiting it quite often, do they get the same Sawaab when they look at itâ€™s picture?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have a very beautiful screensaver that I had downloaded from: http://www.netmuslims.com/downloads/screensavers.html When I glance at it, the image of the Kaaba with the virtual tawaaf looks so real, I?d almost feel like making a Du?aa, remembering the Ahadith about ?making Du?aa when glancing at the Kaaba?.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe picture of the Ka'abah is not the same as the actual Ka'abah. Hence, the\nreward of glancing at its picture would not be the same as looking at the\nactual Ka'abah.\n\nHowever, one may look at it with reverence simply because it is an image of\nthe actual Ka'abah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
