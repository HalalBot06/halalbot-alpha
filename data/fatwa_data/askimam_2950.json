  "question": "Ahadith not protected from error only Qur'an is. If you say that ahadith were divinely revealed why they are not part of Qurâ€™an?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe only infallible guidance from Allah is Qur?an. The narrations of people from people which were collected from the memories of people bound to have mistakes init. When we follow the prophet we follow the vahi (revelation) he received in the form of Qur?an. I have doubts in ahadith only because however pain was taken to establish the authenticity of ahadtih but the fact remains that ahadith are not revelations by Allah suhana wa ta?ala thus there is no guarantee of their authenticity. Allah didn?t promise that he will protect the narrations of prophet?s companions from error. However if you say that ahadith were divinely revealed why they are not part of Qur?an?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE REFUTATION OF THE HADITH AND THE AUTHENTICITY%0D%0AOF ITS COMPILATION%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Ahaadith of Rasulullah ((Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) have been%0D%0Aunanimously accepted by the entire Ummah as the source of Islamic Law, after%0D%0Athe Noble Qur%E3n. In fact, upon pondering, it can be concluded that the%0D%0Aentire Ahaadith contain the real essence of Islamic Law (Islamic Shariah) as%0D%0Athe Ahaadith comprise of the mubarak words, actions and approvals of the%0D%0AHoly Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) who has interpreted the Noble%0D%0AQuran and defined its object and purpose. However, it is regrettable that a%0D%0Acertain group of people influenced by the corrupt western culture and%0D%0Acivilization, have began refuting the Ahaadith.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the beginning of the twentieth century, when the Western nations%0D%0Adominated over Muslims, many Muslims of poor understanding and little%0D%0Aknowledge became overwhelmed by the Western Ideologies and concepts. They%0D%0Aopined that progress was impossible without upholding and adopting the%0D%0Awestern lifestyle. They began propagating this concept among the masses. In%0D%0Aorder to propagate this concept they distorted all the Islamic teachings%0D%0Athat opposed this western culture and ideology. This group was called the%0D%0Amodernists. Among the leaders of such groups were people like Sir Sayed and%0D%0AAhmed Khan of India, Taha Hussain of Egypt and Ziyad Khog of Turkey. It%0D%0Ashould be borne in mind that the objects and aims of this group could not be%0D%0Aachieved without rejecting the Ahaadith because, the Ahaadith contain%0D%0Adetailed guidelines to every aspect of life which are totally opposed to%0D%0Awestern norms and trends.%0D%0A%0D%0AConsequently, a group among this cult began to negate the Ahaadith and%0D%0Acalled themselves the \"Quranic Group\". Sir Sayed and his companion Moulvi%0D%0AChirag Ali were the founders of this movement in India. They did not negate%0D%0Athe Ahaadith completely, instead they rejected all those that were contrary%0D%0Ato their aims and objects and their limited understanding and reasoning even%0D%0Athough all these Ahaadith were authentically narrated. They discreetly%0D%0Apropagated that the Ahaadith are not legal Shariah proof in this age and%0D%0Aera. This led to the legalising of interest and usury; the rejection of the%0D%0AProphets, the denial of the Angels, the negation of Purdah and other%0D%0Aessentials of Islam, and moreover, legalizing of prohibited things.%0D%0A%0D%0AThereafter, Abdullah Chakardalwi formed a group called, Quranic Group and%0D%0Ahis object was the total rejection of Ahaadith. This concept was further%0D%0Apromoted by Aslam Inerajpuri. Finally, Gulam Ahmed Parwez established this%0D%0Aerroneous belief among the masses through his influential writings. This%0D%0Afitnah spread widely in his period (era). Basically this fitnah revolves%0D%0Aaround 3 different beliefs viz.%0D%0A1. The Holy Prophet's (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) mission was to deliver%0D%0Athe Quran only. Obedience is restricted to the Quran only. Adherence to the%0D%0AHoly Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is not binding upon us, nor was%0D%0Ait binding upon the Sahaba (RA). Divine Revelation was only in the form of%0D%0Athe Quran. Hence there is no need for the Ahaadith.%0D%0A2. The Sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) were%0D%0Abinding and obligatory upon the Sahaba (RA) only, not upon us.%0D%0A3. The teachings of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) are%0D%0Abinding upon the entire Ummah. However, due to the Ahaadith being%0D%0Aunauthentic, we are not obliged to accept them%0D%0A%0D%0AAll these concepts are totally false and rejected. Numerous verses of the%0D%0ANoble Quran, prove that divine revelation besides the Noble Quran, was%0D%0Arevealed to the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Missions of the%0D%0AHoly Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) as mentioned in the Noble Qur%E3n%0D%0Ais to teach and explain the Noble Qur%E3n and its wisdom. If the Ahaadith are%0D%0Arejected, can this object of teaching and explaining the Quran be realised?%0D%0AAnother clear indication towards the authenticity of the Ahaadith is the%0D%0Afact that the Noble Qur%E3n commands us to show obedience to the Holy Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) together with obedience to Allah. In one%0D%0Averse, obedience to the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has been%0D%0Aregarded as the basis of Imaan. Logically, it is not possible to follow the%0D%0AQuranic injunctions without the Ahaadith as the details of many Quranic%0D%0Ainjunctions such as Salaat, Zakaat, Haj, etc. are explained in the Ahaadith.%0D%0AThe entire Ummah has accepted the authenticity of the Ahaadith in order to%0D%0Amake the divine injunctions practical. Can it be claimed that the entire%0D%0AUmmah is misguided?%0D%0A%0D%0AThe fallacy of the second (concept) belief i.e. obedience of the Holy%0D%0AProphet is binding upon the Sahaba (RA) only, is evident and exposed that%0D%0Aneeds no further elaboration. This concept implies that the Prophethood of%0D%0Athe Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was restricted only to the%0D%0Aperiod of his companions whereas numerous verses very clearly indicate the%0D%0Aopposite. - \"O people I am a prophet to all of you\". \"We did not send you%0D%0Aexcept to all the people' as a giver of glad tidings and as a warner\". \"We%0D%0Adid not send you, except as a mercy to all the worlds\". \"Blessed is the one%0D%0Awho revealed the Furqaan that he may be a warner to the worlds\".%0D%0A%0D%0AAnother question that arises with this concept is: Are the Sahaba who%0D%0Awitnessed the revelation of the Noble Qur%E3n more in need of its explanation%0D%0Aor are the ones that came after them more in need?%0D%0A%0D%0AThe third concept is also totally unacceptable because the Quran has reached%0D%0Aus through the same method as the Ahaadith have reached us. If the Ahaadith%0D%0Aare unauthentic, can one declare the Noble Quran unauthentic as well. The%0D%0Adivine promise of safe-guarding Noble Qur%E3n embodies the safeguarding of the%0D%0AAhaadith also, because the Ahaadith explain the Quran without which one%0D%0Acannot practise upon the Quran.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE STAGES OF THE COMPILATION OF AHAADITH%0D%0AThe Ahaadith were not compiled and codified in the time of the Holy Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) like it is today. There existed no real need%0D%0Afor this as the Sahaba memorised virtually every word spoken by the Holy%0D%0AProphet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Allah Ta'ala had granted them such%0D%0Aperfect and excellent memories that once they heard anything they used to%0D%0Aremember it throughout their lives. The remembering of lengthy poems and the%0D%0Aancestral details of horses and camels bears testimony to this fact. Once%0D%0AHazrat Ibn Umar (RA) repeated Ahaadith to a bedouin, in order for him to%0D%0Amemorize it well. The bedouin remarked, \"Enough, once is sufficient I shall%0D%0Anot forget it till death. I have performed 60 pilgrimages on 60 camels and I%0D%0Aknow perfectly well which Hajj I performed on which camel.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AThis was the condition of the bedouins in ordinary matters and mundane talk.%0D%0AHow much more did they preserve the speech of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam). Not only his speech but every action notion, indication,%0D%0Aapproval, disapproval and deed of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Awas preserved by them. They valued these more than their lives and wealth.%0D%0AThey used to alternate with their business partners in sitting in the%0D%0Agathering of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Each partner%0D%0Aused to narrate to his companion what he had heard the Holy Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) say. Extreme measures were taken to safeguard%0D%0Athe words of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Many of them%0D%0A(did not know how to write) were not literate. However, the Sahaba who knew%0D%0Ahow to write used to record and write down the Ahaadith as well. The%0D%0AAhaadith were recorded in the presence of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam)%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE PROHIBITION OF RECORDING HADITH AND ITS ANSWER%0D%0AThe Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has mentioned in one Hadith,%0D%0A'Do not record (write) from me anything except the Quran. Whosoever has%0D%0Awritten anything should obliterate it. (Muslim vol.2 Pg.44)%0D%0A%0D%0AThis prohibition is of a temporary nature when the Quran was initially being%0D%0Arevealed (and there was a possibility of the hadith and Quran being mixed%0D%0Aup) so that the hadith and the Quran do not get mixed up. When this initial%0D%0Aperiod has passed and this possibility was ruled out, this prohibition%0D%0Aceased and an order was given to write and record the Ahaadith as Allama%0D%0AIbne-Hajar has detailed in his commentary on Bukhari Shareef. Allama Nawawi%0D%0Ain the commentary of Muslim Shareef has stated that the prohibition was when%0D%0Athe mixing was feared. Thereafter when it was safe, permission was granted%0D%0Afor writing.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE THREE METHODS OF PRESERVING AND SAFEGUARDING THE HADITH%0D%0AWe hereby detail all the methods utilised to preserve Ahaadith from the%0D%0Aprophetic era upto this day. There is consensus that recording and writing%0D%0Awas not the only method of safeguarding Ahaadith. There existed other%0D%0Areliable methods as well:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. MEMORISING THE AHAADITH%0D%0AThe most reliable method adopted by the Sahaaba (RA) to safeguard the%0D%0AAhaadith was through memory.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. PRESERVATION THROUGH ACTION AND PRACTICE%0D%0AThis was another reliable means of protecting and safeguarding the Ahaadith.%0D%0AThe Sahaaba (RA) used to transform the words of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) into action immediately and every Sahaabi used to practice%0D%0Aupon the Hadith. This resulted in every word of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) becoming a practical action and deed, which was thoroughly%0D%0Aremembered and preserved. Therefore, many traditions contact the phrases:%0D%0A\"This is how I saw the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) carry out%0D%0Aand perform this.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AThis practical method was very effective in preserving the Ahaadith. It is%0D%0Acontinuing upto this day.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. WRITING AND RECORDING THE HADITH%0D%0AThis method was also customary in the prophetic era. This procedure had%0D%0Apassed through four stages (phases)%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Recording of Ahaadith without any arrangement or sequence%0D%0A2. Arranging the Ahaadith relating to certain subject (topic) or subjects%0D%0Ainto one small book%0D%0A3. Accumulating of various Ahaadith into one book.%0D%0A4. Compiling Ahaadith and codifying.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe first two types of compiling were extensively practised during the time%0D%0Aof the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the Sahaba (RA). The%0D%0Afollowing details will suffice for the Rejectors of Hadith.%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Imam Tirmidhi has included a special chapter in the Chapter of knowledge%0D%0Atitled, The chapter of the permissibility of recording Hadith - Hazrat Abu%0D%0AHurrairah (RA) reports that the Holy Prophet indicated to a certain Ansari%0D%0ASahabi whose memory was weak, to write. One Ansari Sahabi (RA) used to sit%0D%0Aby Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and listen to the Hadith; it%0D%0Aused to please him, but he was unable to memorise it. He complained to the%0D%0AHoly Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) who replied, \"Seek assistance%0D%0Awith your right hand and he indicated towards writing with his hand (Jamia%0D%0ATirmizi vol. 2 pg. 107).%0D%0A2. In a tradition recorded in Mustadrak-e-Haakim, Hazrat Amr bin Aas (R.A.)%0D%0Areports, 'I used to record everything the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) used to say with an incitation of (accumility) and gathering same.%0D%0AThe Quraish stopped me saying: \"Do you write everything the Holy Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) says? He is a human being, he speaks in anger%0D%0Aand happiness.\" I abstained from writing. I mentioned this to the Holy%0D%0AProphet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and he indicated towards his tongue%0D%0Aand said, 'Write! By Him in whose hand is my life. Nothing except the truth%0D%0Acomes out of it.' (Mustadrak Vol.1 Page 104)%0D%0A3. In one Hadith recorded in Mustadrak-e-Haakim, an explicit and clear order%0D%0Aof writing is given. The words are 'Tie down knowledge', the Sahaabi%0D%0Aenquired, 'What is tying down knowledge?' The Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) replied, 'It's writing.' (Mustadrak vol. 1 pg. 106)%0D%0A4. The incident of Abu Shah Yemani is famous. Once the Holy Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) mentioned an incident and upon the request of%0D%0AAbu Shah the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) instructed the%0D%0ASahaaba to write for Abu Shah - this Hadith is recorded in Jame Tirmidhi%0D%0Avol. 2 pg. 107 and Bukhari vol. 1 pg. 23%0D%0A%0D%0AThere are numerous traditions indicating the instruction of writing%0D%0AAhaadith. Therefore, many Sahaaba recorded ahaadith in the Prophetic era.%0D%0AReferences are many of such collections and compilations.%0D%0A%0D%0A1. THE SAHIFA (COLLECTION) OF ABDULLAH IBN AMR (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu)%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Hurayrah (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) is the greatest narrator of Hadith.%0D%0ADespite this he says, 'No person has learnt more Hadith than me. However,%0D%0AAbdullah bin Amr (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) used to write the Hadith and I should%0D%0Anot write.' This is clear evidence that Hadith used to be written in that%0D%0Aera. Hadhrat Abdullah bin Amr (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) possessed a collection%0D%0Athat exceeded one thousand Ahaadith. Ibnr-Rushd has mentioned in his Kitaab%0D%0AAsadul Ghaaba (vol. 3 pg. 233) that, this collection was named As-saadiqah.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. THE SAHIFA (COLLECTION OF HADHRAT ALI (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu)%0D%0AImaam Bukhari (RA) has mentioned in this Sahifa in the chapter of \"Ilm\"%0D%0A(vol. 1 pg. 21) and, he has mentioned it in four places The narrator Abu%0D%0AJuhaifa reports that, 'I enquired from Hazrat Ali (R.A.), do you possess a%0D%0Abook?' He replied: \"No, except the Book of Allah or the understanding%0D%0Agranted to a Muslim or what is in this Sahifa.\" I asked him, \"What is in%0D%0Athis Sahifa?\" He replied, \"Orders relating to 'Diyat' (penalty or murder) -%0D%0Athe freeing of prisoners and no Muslim will be killed in lieu of a kaafir.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AThis Sahifa contained orders regarding, murder, compensations, capital%0D%0Apunishments, details of Zakaat and matters relating to non-Muslim citizens%0D%0Ain an Islamic State.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. KITABUS - SAQAH%0D%0AThis collection was personally dictated by the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam). It contained details regarding Zakaat, Ushar etc.%0D%0AAccording to some reports it seems as though this was written for the Zakaat%0D%0Acollectors. However, the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) left%0D%0Athis world before it was sent to them. This kitaab remained with Hazrat Abu%0D%0ABakr and Hazrat Umar (R.A.). Eventually Hazrat Umar bin Abdul Aziz memorized%0D%0Ait and thereafter Ibn Shihaab Zohri memorised it.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. SAHIFA IBN ABBAS (R.A.)%0D%0AIbn Saad (R.A.) mentions in his kitaab \"Tabaqaat\" that the slave of Ibn%0D%0AAbbas (R.A.) said 'He found a large collection of the kitaabs of Ibn Abbas%0D%0Aequal to a camel-load.'%0D%0A%0D%0A5. SAHIFA JAABIR IBN ABDULLAH (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu)%0D%0AImaam Muslim has reported that Hadhrat Jaabir (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) had%0D%0Acompiled a book on Hajj. Imaam Bukhari mentioned this is his%0D%0ATaarikh-e-Kabeer vol. 7 pg. 186) - Hadhrat Qataaqda bin De'aama as-Sodusi%0D%0Ahad memorised this Sahifa.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. SAHIFA SAMURA IBN JUNDOB (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu)%0D%0AHafiz ibn Hajar (RA) reports that Hadhrat Samoora (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) has%0D%0Anarrated a big (volume) chapter from his father. Imaam Muhammad ibn Sireen%0D%0A(RA) reports that the Kitaab which Hadhrat Samoora (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) has%0D%0Awritten for his children contains great knowledge.%0D%0A%0D%0A7. SAHIFA SAAD IBN UBADA%0D%0AIbn Saad reports in 'Tabaqaat' that Hadhrat Saad (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) had a%0D%0Acollection of Ahaadith.%0D%0A%0D%0A8. SAHIFA ABU HURAYRA (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu)%0D%0AImaam Hakim mentions in Mustadrak that once Hadhrat Hassan ibn Umar narrated%0D%0Aa Hadith to Hadhrat Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu). Hadhrat Abu Hurayra%0D%0Adenied the Hadith. Hadhrat Hassan told him, 'I have narrated this Hadith%0D%0Afrom you'. He replied, 'If I have narrated it, it will definitely be written%0D%0Adown.'%0D%0A%0D%0AHe had written down all his Hadith in the end.%0D%0A%0D%0A9. SAHIFA IBN MAS'OOD%0D%0AHafiz ibn Abdul-Barr (RA) mentions in his Kitaab, 'Jaame Bayaan nul-Ilm'%0D%0Athat ibn Mas'ood (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) took out one Kitaab and swore an oath%0D%0Athat it was compiled by him.%0D%0A%0D%0A10. SAHIFA AMR IBN HAZAM (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu)%0D%0AWhen the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) appointed Hadhrat ibn%0D%0AHazam (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) as a governor of Najran, he gave him a Sahifa%0D%0Awhich was written by Hadhrat Ubayy bin Ka'ab. It contained orders regarding%0D%0Acleanliness, purification, Salaat, Hajj, Umra, Jihaad, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0A11. SAHIFA IBN MUBAARAK%0D%0AHadhrat Sa'eed ibn Hilaal says, 'When we frequented Hadhrat Anas bin Maalik%0D%0Ahe took out a volume and said, 'I heard these from the Holy Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). I have written it and preserved it.'%0D%0A(Mustadrak Hakim vol. 3 pg. 54)%0D%0A%0D%0A12. There are many other small Sahifas which the holy Prophet (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) sent to the kings; and, other compilations which have been%0D%0Aomitted for the sake of brevity.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE ERA OF HADHRAT UMAR BIN ABDUL AZIZ%0D%0AThough the writing of the Ahaadith had commenced it was not done in an%0D%0Aarranged manner, i.e. it was compiled and codified. Due to the%0D%0Apre-occupations of the Khulafaa-e-Raashideen with the compilation of the%0D%0ANoble Qur%E3n and other important matters, it was not possible for them to%0D%0Aaccomplish this task.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, when the politicians at the time of Hazrat Ali (R.A.) began to%0D%0Afabricate false Ahaadith Hazrat Ali became concerned about safeguarding the%0D%0Aauthentic Ahaadith. He used to stand on the mimbar and announce the%0D%0Aauthentic Ahaadith to the people. This continued till the period of Hazrat%0D%0AUmar bin Abdul Aziz (R.A.) who became the khalifa after the demise of%0D%0ASulayman bin Abdul Malik. His khilafat lasted only for 2 years. After%0D%0Aaccepting khilafat, he wrote to the judge of Madinah, Abubakr bin Hazm%0D%0Asaying, \"Whatever you find from the Ahaadith of the Holy Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), write it down. I fear the loss of knowledge%0D%0Aand the passing away of the Ulema. (Bukhari vol.1 page 20)%0D%0A%0D%0AHafiz Ibn Hajar mentions that this letter was addressed to all the Judges of%0D%0Aevery province. A large collection of Ahaadith were compiled in this manner%0D%0Ain the first century.%0D%0A1. Hafiz Ibn Abdul Bar has written that Qazi Abu Bakr has compiled many%0D%0Abooks on Ahaadith called \"Books of Abu Bakr.\"%0D%0A2. The Risala (Booker) of Saalim ibn Abdullah on Sadaqaat.%0D%0A3. The Registers of Zohri - he says that whenever we were given any command%0D%0Awe compiled a brief register. He had played a great role in the compilation%0D%0Aof Hadith.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE COMPILATIONS OF THE SECOND - CENTURY%0D%0AVarious collections of Hadith are found in this era like Jame Ma'moon bin%0D%0ARaashid, Jame Sufyaan Sowri, As-Sunem of Ibn Juray - Sunan Abul Waleed -%0D%0AMu'atta Imam Maalik.%0D%0A%0D%0A%3EFrom the above discussion we reach the following conclusion that: 1. The%0D%0Arecording and writing of hadith had began from the time of the Holy Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A2. Compiling had began in the time of the Sahaba (R.A.) especially in the%0D%0Atime of Hazrat Ali (R.A.);%0D%0A4. Hazrat Umar bin Abdul Aziz strived in this matter and a large collection%0D%0Awas accumulated during his period;%0D%0A5. Many books were compiled in the first century;%0D%0A6. the objections and arguments of the Rejectors of hadith are fully%0D%0Aanswered;%0D%0A7. the fitnah of Rejection in hadith is old and detrimental to religion, in%0D%0Afact rejecting the Quran;%0D%0A8. the Ahaadith are a complementary and explanation of the Quran;%0D%0A9. the safeguarding of the Quran entails the safeguarding of the Hadith.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best.%0D%0A%0D%0APrepared and compiled for the Jamiat (KZN) by: Mufti Abdul-Jaleel Qaasimi -%0D%0ASheikhul Hadith, Madrasah Ta'leemuddin (Isipingo Beach); Member, Jamiatul%0D%0AUlama (KZN)%0D%0ATranslated by: Moulana Haroon Abbasommar - Senior lecturer, Madrasah%0D%0ATa'leemuddin (Isipingo Beach); Imaam, Isipingo Beach Masjid; ex-President%0D%0Aand member, Jamiatul Ulama (KZN)%0D%0A%0D%0A"
