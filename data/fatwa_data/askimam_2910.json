  "question": "What subjects are permissible to study at college or university and what are strictly not permissible?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn choosing a career, consider the following advice of Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam): 'Do not undertake an involvement that would\nhinder your practice on religion.' (Mishk√£t pg.441; Qadeemi)\n\nThe fundamental focus in choosing a profession is to preserve one's Deeni\nand Islamic values. It is not permissible to pursue a profession in which a\nperson will be compelled to compromise his Deen. Religious rights of\nnon-Muslims have become a tourist attraction and places of honour. Honouring\nsuch places is obviously prohibited in Islam as it is in honour of incorrect\nbelief and Aqaaid. As such, it is not permissible to undertake the trade of\ntourism as an income if it will involve the above or any other sinful\nactivity.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
