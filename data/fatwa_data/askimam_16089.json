  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a query on the 10 of Muharram as stated under by two respected Ulemas. Can you please through some light on it.\n\n\"However, there are some legends and misconceptions with regard to 'Ashura' that have managed to find their way into the minds of the ignorant, but have no support of authentic Islamic sources, some very common of them are these: This is the day on which Adam, alayhi salam, was created. This is the day when Ibrahim, alayhi salam, was born. This is the day when Allah accepted the repentance of Sayyidina Adam, alayhi salam. This is the day when Qiyaamah (doomsday) will take place.\"\n\nCommentry on Muharram By Mufti Taqi Usmani\n\nHowever, the Taleemul Islam Part 2 of Mufti Muhammad Kifayaatullah. States that:\n\nQ. When will Qiyaamah come?\nA. Qiyaamah is to come. But none except Allah knows its exact time. Only this much is known, that it will be Friday and the date will be the 10th of Muharram. Our Prophet ( sallallahu alayhiwassalam ) has given some of the signs of Qiyaamah. Observing these signs, the nearness of Qiyaamah may be known.\n\nCan you please let me know which one is correct.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nMawlana Fadhl al-Rahman Sahib, the Shaykh al-Hadith of Dar al-Uloom Azadville, has prepared a concise treatise regarding this issue. He states that there are no reliable narrations supporting the view that Qiyama will take place on Ashura. He further states that the narrations stating that Qiyama will take place on the 10th of Muharram are classified as Mawdoo (fabricated) by many Muhaditheen. (Majmu’ah Maqalat, pg. 45 – 46, Madrasa Da’wa al-Haqq) Based upon the information contained in this treatise, it becomes apparent that the view of Mufti Taqi Usmani Sahib is correct.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
