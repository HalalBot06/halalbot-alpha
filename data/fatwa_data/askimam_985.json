Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Álaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nKindly refer Hijaab at www.jamiat.org.za/isinfo/hijaab.html and 'When Women Emerge' at www.jamiat.org.za/isinfo/w_emerge.html\n\nIf you have no source of income and have to support yourself and your dependants, then you should try to confine your services to females only. If you are compelled to communicate with males then you will be excused. However, you should not be in isolation with any strange male. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'When a strange male and female are in isolation, then third is Shaytaan.' Furthermore, when communicating with a male, lower your gaze and limit the discussion to the need. Free mixing and 'merry' discussion with strange males are prohibited.\n\nAnd Allah Taãla Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
