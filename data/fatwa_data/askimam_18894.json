Giving zakāh to one’s poor family (brother, sister etc.) is commendable and liable for extra reward. It is mentioned in a hadīth that by giving charity to one’s relatives one receive double a reward, one reward for giving charity and the other for showing kindness to them.\n\n \n\n2. Yes it is permissible; it is not necessary to mention, zakāh will be discharged by merely making the intention of zakāh.\n\n(Bahisti Zewar, Pg.346, Zam Zam)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl.
