For example, lets say a cat, person A treats cats very well, regardless of his or neighbor cat, will that come in the day of judgement and say to Allah(swt) tht he/she treated me nice or bad ???\n\n2) my Second question is which animal does Islam allows to keep as a pet ? Can one keep cat as a pet ??? and so does birds ?\n\n3) Also, is watching nature documentaries allowed in Islam ? BEST EXAMPLE, here I am talking abuot is a documentray called PLANET EARTH, in that documentary no body is elling anything haram and lies, so is it ok if I watch it ??\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1)      It is indeed a sin to ill treat animals. Islam encourages us to treat animals with care. A person will be rewarded for being kind to an animal, be it his own or someone else’s. Similarly a person will be punished for ill treating an animal. It is stated in the Ahadith of Nabiصلى الله عليه و سلم:\n\nعن سهل ابن الحنظلية قال  مر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ببعير قد لحق ظهره ببطنه فقال  اتقوا الله فى هذه البهائم المعجمة فاركبوها وكلوها صالحة  \n\nIt has been narrated from Hazrat Sahl bin Hanthalaرضي الله عنه that Rasulullah صلى الله عليه وسلمpassed by a camel which was very thin, he then said “Fear Allah regarding these animals, so ride it and eat it Appropriately.”(Abu Dawood)\n\n \n\nعن جابر أن النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم مر عليه حمار قد وسم فى وجهه فقال  لعن الله الذى وسمه\n\nHazrat Jabirرضي الله عنه narrates that Nabiصلى الله عليه و سلم passed by a donkey which was branded in its face, he then said “May the curse of Allah be on the one who branded it.” (Muslim)\n\n \n\nعن عبد الله أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم-قال  عذبت امرأة فى هرة سجنتها حتى ماتت فدخلت فيها النار لا هى أطعمتها وسقتها إذ حبستها ولا هى تركتها تأكل من خشاش الأرض\n\nRasulullah صلى الله عليه وسلم said “A woman was punished regarding a cat she imprisoned until it died. She was put in Jahanam. She did not feed it nor gave it to drink; instead she imprisoned it and did not leave it to eat from the vermin of the earth.” (Muslim)\n\n \n\nعن أبي هريرة عن النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم\n\n  أن رجلا رأى كلبا يأكل الثرى من العطش فأخذ الرجل خفه فجعل يغرف له به حتى أرواه فشكر الله له فأدخله الجنة \n\n \n\nAbu Hurairah رضي الله عنه narrates from Nabi   صلى الله عليه وسلم \n\n“That a man saw a dog eating mud due to thirst so the man took his shoe and began scooping (water) for the dog (to drink) with it until he quenched its thirst. Allah granted Jannat to the person.” (Bukhari)\n\nFrom the above it clear the importance Islam gives to animals and how they should be treated.\n\n2)       It is permissible to keep birds and cats as pets.\n\n3)       It is not permissible to watch these documentaries.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nZakariyya bin Ahmed,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
