  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs-salaamu alaykum,\n\nI am 15 years old and born as an Iranian Twelver Shia. Both my parents are the same. After research I have decided that the Sunnis are cloest to the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW). I have never really been a practicing Muslim and have held Kufr throughout my short life, but when I did get interested in Islam, and after much research, I choose that I would like to practice Islam as a Hanafi Sunni, even though my culture and heritage is Twelver Shia.\n\nTherefore, what I would like to ask is how I go about becoming a Sunni:\n\n1) Do I need to say the Shahadah? Or any special kind of Prayer or Du'a?\n\n2) If I must recite the Shahadah, can I say the Shahadah in private with Allah as my only witness?\n\n3) After saying the Shahadah what must I do? I heard that new converts to Islam should perform Ghusl? Must I do that too?\n\n5) And finally, after all that is done (or whatever else I should do), do I only need to adopt Sunni Aqeedah and Fiqh and implement them in my life?\n\nJazak'Allahu Khayran.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:"
