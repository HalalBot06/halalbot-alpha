  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nQ1) What is your opinion and ruling about a person who is praying alone and then someone joins him (as a Jamaat). Should be change intentions and become an Imam?\n\nQ2) What is your opinion and ruling about a person who was late to congregational (Jamaat) prayer and he stands up to complete his missed Rakaat and another person joins him (as a Jamaat). Should be change intentions and become an Imam although his intention originally was that of a Muqtadi (follower)?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n1.      It is not a pre-requisite for the Imam to make intention of Imaamat in order for the Salaat to be valid. If one is performing Salaat alone and one joins him later, he could make the intention of being an Imaam. He will be rewarded for making the intention of being an Imaam.\n\n[Bahishti Zewar Zam Zam pg130 v1]\n\n2.      According to the Hanafi Mazhab, It is not permissible to follow a Masbooq (late comer) in Salaat (prayer) nor is it permissible for him (Masbooq) to follow another Imaam.\n\n \n\nأَنَّهُ لَا يَجُوزُ اقْتِدَاؤُهُ وَلَا الِاقْتِدَاءُ بِهِ    {فتاوي الهندية ج1 ص102}\n\nوَكَذَا لَا يَصِحُّ اقْتِدَاءُ الْأُمِّيِّ بِالْأَخْرَسِ وَالْكَاسِي بِالْعَارِي وَالْمَسْبُوقِ في قَضَاءِ ما سَبَقَ بمثله  {فتاوي الهندية ص ج}\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
