  "question": "I want to know the Sunnah of offering prayer of two persons in Congregation,",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI want to know the Sunnah of offering prayer of two persons in Congregation,\n\n1- Which side the muqtadi should stand, right of Imam or left?\n\n2- Should both prayerers stand side by side or Imam should be a step ahead.(Any Hadith or supporting material in this regard)\n\n3- How a third person can join the jama't, especially when jama't is iin tashhad or last qa'da?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The Muqtadi should stand on the right hand side of the Imaam. (Al-Ikhtiyaar vol.1 pg.91; Dar al-Arqam)\n\n2. Both the Imaam and Muqtadi should stand side by side. (Qudoori, Badaai’e Sanaai’e vol.1 pg.391). Ibn Abbaas [radhiallaahu anhu] narrates, ‘I stood on the left hand side of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. He motioned me next to him on his right hand side. (Bukhari; Muslim). However, the Mutadi should ensure that his heels do not go ahead of the Imaam’s heels. (Shaami vol.1 pg.567). If the Muqtadi’s heels are in front of the Imaams, his (Muqtadis) Salaat will break. (Ghuniya al-Mutamalli pg.520). As a precaution, Imaam Muhammad [ra] says one should stand in such a manner that his toes are in line with the heels of the Imaam. (Hidaaya).\n\n3. The third person should join by sitting on the left hand side of the Imaam when the Imaam is in Tashahhud in the last Qa’da. (Fath baab inaaya vol.1 pg.290; Beirut)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
