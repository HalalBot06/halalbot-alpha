  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a Muslim female and will soon start my exams for the final year of university. For a few months now I have been feeling very frustrated and depressed. I am very worried about not doing well, and not being able to cope with the pressure. I get upset very quickly over little things because of the pressure I feel. Sometimes I feel like I will lose my mind. I often sit for hours just crying because I feel so helpless. I do not have any motivation, I feel like giving up on my work-because I don't think I can cope with it all.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRecite, 'Rabbi Inniy Mahgloobun Fantasir.'\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
