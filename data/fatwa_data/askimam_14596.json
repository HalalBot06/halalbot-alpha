  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs salamualiakum\n\nI heard somewhere that can alcoholic is denied namaaz-e-janazah is that true? Kindly reply to my question with Quranic verses and hadith. I was also wondering if there are any surah's which a person can read so that their loved one can hate and stop the consumption of alcohol.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nIt is Haram (expressly Prohibited) to drink alcohol or any other intoxicant. It is a major sin and incurs the wrath and anger of Allah. However, a Muslim alcoholic will remain a Muslim in spite of his bad habit and sin. In principle, when a Muslim passes away, Salatul Janazah will be performed for him. It is incorrect that a Muslim alcoholic is denied Salatul Janazah. If ones beloved one has this bad habit, help him to come out of it. Make Dua to Allah and offer assistance to the person to come out of the habit . consult with experts and implement their advices.       \n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
