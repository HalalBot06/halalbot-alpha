  "answer": "QUESTION\nI here a lot about Mowlana Ala' Mawdudi these days, and about all the confusions he has spread threw out the muslim ummah. Respected Mufti Saab, What are your feelings about this man? Who was he, and why do people say he has led us on the wrong path?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nKindly refer below our standard reply to similar queries.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nI refer to your email concerning the criticism that Moulana Ludhianwi\nleveled against Mr. Abu Ala Mawdudi. The gist of your email was that the\ncriticism of Mr. Mawdudi by Moulana Ludhianwi was against the ethics of\nIslam.\n\nIbrahim ibn Abdur-Rahmaan al-Azri (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Straight and upright people\nwill seek their knowledge (of Deen) from their pious predecessors. They\n(straight and upright people) will remove from knowledge, the distortion of\nthe extremists, incorrect attribution of the false people, and incorrect\ninterpretation of the ignorant ones.' (Mishkaat pg.36; Qadeemi)\n\nIn view of the above mentioned Hadith, it is the responsibility of the Ulama\nto preserve the pristine purity of Islam. The Arabic word used to describe\nthat responsibility is 'yanfoon', which is derived from the Arabic root word\nof 'nafyun' which means to remove. The practice of pointing out and removing\nfaults is called criticism. (Oxford School Dictionary; JM Hawkins)\n\nThe writer of the article, well-recognised by the non-Arab as well as Arab\nUlama and a well recognised expert in Firqa-e-Baatila (deviated sects),\nMoulana Muhammad Yusuf Ludhianwi (RA), has maintained his intellectual\nhonesty by fulfilling his scholarly responsibility of pointing out\n(criticizing) Mr. Mawdudi. The writer is concerned that Mr. Mawdudi has\nattacked the very fiber and backbone of Islam by criticizing the illustrious\nProphets and building a wall between the Ummah and the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu\nAnhum). In his constitution, Mr. Mawdudi says, 'No human should be made a\nmeasure of truth besides Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).'. but\nAllah Ta'ala clearly declares the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) as a measure\nof truth in the innumerable verses of the Qur'aan NS in particular, Chapter\n2 verse 13 and chapter 48 (Fath), Verse 29.\n\nMr. Mawdudi should have first consulted with the Ulama before publishing\nsuch articles, thus, indoctrinating an anti-Sahaaba ideology in the Muslim\nmasses. Should Mr. Mawdudi have discussed the matter only with the Ulama,\nthen it could be a purely scholarly matter between him and the Ulama and not\nfor general publication and consumption. However, Mr. Mawdudi himself\nsidestepped scholarly ethics and published his articles before\nconsulting/confirming with the Ulama and made his views known to the public\nfor mass consumption. It is very appropriate and incumbent for the Ulama\n(like Moulana Ludhianwi (RA) has done) to respond then and now publicly\n(given that Mawdudi's views are still disseminated), to correct the\ninaccuracies in Mawdudi's ideas.\n\nThe writer, well-recognised by the non-Arab as well as Arab Ulama and a well\nrecognised expert in Firqa-e-Baatila (deviated sects), Moulana Ludhianwi is\nacting within (and not against) the commands of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu\nAlayhi Wasallam). For example, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)\nsaid, 'When you see anybody speaking ill about any Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu\nAnhu), say to them, 'May Allah's curse be upon your evil.' (Mishkaat pg.552;\nQadeemi). The learned scholar, Moulana Yusuf Ludhianwi has spent his entire\nlife in defending the position of the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) in the\nUmmah and was physically (not only his character) assassinated recently by\nthe enemies of the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum). The learned scholar's\ncriticism against Mawdudi is similar to the criticism against others (such\nas Khomeini) whose ideas and writing go against the fixed, settled,\npermanent and sacrosanct principles of Islam. For example Khomeini once made\na statement which was published in the Tehran times (Kitaab be Noujawanaan -\nP8) that if he conquers Madina Munawwarah, he will remove the two idols\n(Hadhrat Abu Bakr and Hadhrat Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhuma) besides Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nI am certain that no believer will accept such a statement against the great\nluminaries of Islam. Brother Amin, are we then to condemn only Khomeini and\ncondone Mawdudi knowing well that Mawdudi was a close friend of Khomeini and\nwas sympathetic to his course. In a book titled, 'Two brothers - Maududi and\nKhomeini' page 129, the following statement of Dr Ahmad Farouk Maududi (son\nof Abul-A'ala Maududi) was published in Roz Naame, Lahore - 29 September\n1979, \"Allama Khomeini had a very old and close relationship with Abba Jaan\n(father). Aayaatullah Khomeini translated his (fathers) books in Farsi and\nincluded it as a subject in Qum. Allama Khomeini met my father in 1963\nduring Hajj and my father's wish was to create a revolutionary in Pakistan\nsimilar to Iran. He was concerned about the success of the Iranian\nrevolution till his last breath.' You mention in your statement, 'those who\nattack him after he passed away are not following Islamic ethics.' The\nwriter subjects Mawdudi's views to criticism because condoning Mawdudi will\nbe showing complacency to the crime of distancing the Ummah from the Sahaaba\n(Radhiallaahu Anhum). The writer is concerned that such distancing will\neventually lead to distancing ourselves from Islam. After all, the Sahaaba\n(Radhiallaahu Anhum) are the main link between us and Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nYou intimate in your email that the writer was not acting in terms of\nIslamic ethics by attacking Mawdudi after he passed away. Brother Amin, the\ncriticism of Moulana Ludhianwi is consistent with the rules and principles\nof criticism called for in Islam. For example, Hafiz ibn Hajar (RA) in his\nfamous work, 'Nukhbatul Fikr Fee Mustalahi ahlil Asr' under the chapter of\nJarah (criticism), outlines the rules and principles of criticism, which\nare extensively applied in determining the authority of a Hadith. The\nMuhadditheen have criticized many narrators with the sole purpose of\ndetermining the authenticity of the Ahaadith. Criticizing them is certainly\nethical in Islam and only conducive to preserving the pristine purity of\nIslam. What if the Muhadditheen did not make Jarah of every narrator and\ncriticize many who did not fulfill the criteria of being Aadil? What if\nevery person goes against the directives of the Qur'aan and Hadith and\ncriticize the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum)? What will be left of Islam?\n\nShould Mawdudi have the right to criticize the Prophets and Sahaaba and we\ndon't have the right to criticize him simply because he says, ''It is\nAllah's faith that I did not commit any deed or say any word under the\ninfluence of my passions, nor did I commit it. Every word that I uttered in\nmy lectures, I measured each one of them before saying them, remembering\nthat I would have to account for it before Allah and the creation.\nTherefore, I am assured in my position that I did not utter a word against\nHaq'. Maududi Mazhab, page 29. Should someone become emotional when Mawdudi\nis criticized because he is my friends icon? Moulana Ludhianwi is reminding\nus ot be rational and to follow the guidance of Abdullah ibn Mas'ood who\nsaid: ''If you wish to follow anyone, then follow the path of those who have\npassed away, because one is not safe from the fitnah of a living person. I\nmean those who are among the Sahaabah of Muhammed Sallallahu alaihi\nwaSallam. They were the best among this Ummah; they possessed the clearest\nof hearts; they attained the deepest of knowledge; and had the least\nformalities. Allah Ta'aala had chosen them as companions of His Nabi and to\nup- keep His Deen. Therefore, recognize their virtues, and follow their\nfootsteps. As far as possible hold fast unto their characters and qualities,\nbecause they are on the straight path'. (Mishkaat, Chapter of I'etisaam bil\nkaab Wassunnah; Qadeemi)\n\nIt would be ironic for someone to say today do not criticize Mawdudi, given\nthat Mawdudi criticized so many of the illustrious sahabah. Such a stance\nwill also be against the entrenched precept of Article 1 of the By-Laws of\nICM (copy obtained by me in 1999 during your blessed rein of leadership):\n'You are the best of people evolved for mankind - Enjoining what is right,\nForbidding what is Wrong and Believing in God.' (Surah Aali Imraan).'\n\nBrother, I have limited my response primarily to your concern about whether\nthe criticism of Moulana Ludhianwi is within the ethical prescriptions of\nIslam. If you feel that Moulana Ludhianwi misrepresented or fabricated the\nrecord of Mawdudi please let me know which aspect or aspects concern you. I\nwill be glad to comment on that as well."
