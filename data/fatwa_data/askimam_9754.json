  "question": "Is it taqwa to abstain from the chicken meat that was stunned by electric shock, even though it stays alive till slaughter?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am working as a chicken supplier for a muslim company which is in another province. A good muslim brother, who is also related to dawa jammat work, is Director of this company. Recently I came to know of the procedure being followed at their zabeeha plant, as outlined below: 1. First chickens are dipped in water having mild electric current, which makes chix slightly unconscious. 2. After manually slaughtering, after saying takbeer, feathers are removed by dipping them in luke warm water. Our Director said that as they deal with thousands of chix per day, it is necessary to make them slightly unconscious but there is no chance of chix dying away during this process. He said that, even it might be possible that slightly unconscious birds may become fully conscious if slaughter is delayed. Now the problem is that one of my (muslim) friend told me that 1. any type of stunning of chix, beef, or goat, makes the meat of that animal ?makrooh?, even though the animal didn?t die of stunning. 2. income from selling of that kind of meat is doubtful and not halal. As there is much job uncertainity, I wish to continue this business. 3. if the process of stunning is makrooh, then does this also make the meat of that chix/animal makrooh? Please make these points clear. Is it taqwa to abstain from the chicken meat that was stunned by electric shock, even though it stays alive till slaughter?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe procedure of slaughtering the chickens explained by you is permissible. The chickens will be Halaal and the income of the sale of such chickens will also be Halaal.\n\nThe dipping of the chickens in electric water due to the large procession will be excused, if there is no adequate alternative.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
