  "question": "what are the requirements for woman to wear a hijab?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI want to know what are the requirements for woman to wear a hijab? She needs to know the Quran by heart, needs to know 10 or 20 surah? Be good to everyone? What are the requirements?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is compulsory for every woman to conceal the beauty, form and shape of her body in front of non-Mahrams (men who are not prohibited for her in marriage). She should wear lose clothing which do not have attractive colours. This ruling of Hijaab is for every woman irrespective of her knowing the entire Qur’aan or part of the Qur’aan and whether she is good at all or not.\n\nIt must also be pointed out that the general concept of the Hijaab being only a head covering is not correct. Some woman cover their hair and still wear tightfitting and revealing clothing and incorrectly regard themselves as observing Hijaab. If the beauty, form and shape of a woman is exposed, that defeats the concept of Hijaab by merely wearing a headscarf.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
