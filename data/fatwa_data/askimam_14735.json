  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu respected Mufti,\n\nI want to pray in the Masjid (which is nearby), but the problem is that my  my mother forbid sme to pray there. I tried talking to her, but she doesn't want to. I don't know what to do. I find it very difficult to disobey her and obey the command of Allah and his Messenger (Sallallahu Alaihie Wa Sallam (Astagfirullah).\n\nPlease advice me how to deal with this problem, cause I just don't know what to do. I've been thinking she's right and I'm the bad guy cause the rest of the family is supporting her....\n\nI don't have the Imaan to disobey her. Should I increase my faith first and then pray in the Masjid?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nRespected Brother in Islam\n\nAssalamu alaukum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh\n\nWe do not know your background as well as the reason your mother prohibits you from performing Salah in the nearby musjid.\n\nIf we knew your background, being a muslim by birth or reverting to Islam as well as the reasons your mother prohibits you from performing Salah in the nearby musjid, we could be in a better position to advise you.\n\nIn principle, it is compulsory for you to be respectful to your mother.Humble yourself before her. Take care of her to the best of your ability.Allah will be pleased with you if your mother is pleased with you.However, it is not permissible for you to go against the laws of Shariah and Islam in pleasing your mother.In that instance, Allah will be displeased.You cannot let that happen.Allah must be pleased at all times.\n\nTo perform Salah in the musjid is compulsory.You cannot leave that out.You should perform your Salah in the musjid.If your mother objects, don’t be rude.Be quite and fulfill your obligations of performing Salah in the musjid.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala knows best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n1. When the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\n2. The guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\n\n3. Education and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\n\n4. Islam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\n\n5. When one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\n\n6. Muslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\n\n7. We have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\n\n8. If you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\n\n9. If that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\n\n10. Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, \"When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit\".\n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
