  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy mother passed away a few months back I have a few photos of her as remembrance. I don't know if I should destroy the photos or not. Does the deceased person receive punishment if there are photos of them still in this world. 2. What is the correct way of keeping a beard, must it be a fist length on all 3 sides or just the bottom. Are we allowed to trim the beard.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIslƒÅm only permits a person to take photos out of necessity. Once a person has left this world there no longer remains the need to have any photos. Therefore, we advise that all photos be burnt.\n\nIt is necessary to keep a full fist length beard from all three sides. One is permitted to trim anything more than a fist.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl. Ishaq E.
