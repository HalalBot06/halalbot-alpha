  "question": "is forex trading allowed ?The procedure of a normal interest based trade is: you buy one currency against dollar for",
  "answer": "QUESTION\ninstance buy pound and sell dollar. Your account is in dollars. you deposit $500 and get to trade on a margin. Each trade is for 100000 currency units- in our case we buy 100000 pounds for $500 margin. You dont get a physical delivery but you are liable for the payment and will enjoy all the risks and benefits. you realize your profit or loss by selling back the pounds you bought. If the buy and sell takes place the same day, you dont get charged any interest. if you dont close your position, everyday you are charged $5 per 100,000 currency units. To normal customers these trades have no commission or charges. Now for muslim investors, what the companies do, instead of charging daily interest, they charge a $20 per trade( buy and sell ) as a commission. This commision allows the investor to have a grace period of 3 days for closing the trade instead of 1 day in the normal scenario. BUT after the 3rd day, everyday the commission is charged for all open positions. 1) Please tell, whether or not the procedure for muslim investor devised by these companies is halal ? 2)Can we only day trade (buying and selling the same day) so no interest is involved. 3) what does islam says about trading forex on margin ? in what circumstance would a muslim allowed to perform margin-based trade ? Please reply ASAP as this industry is attracting people more than the stock markets- Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis matter is currently under research by the Board of Muftis of South Africa and is scheduled to be discussed in about two months time.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
