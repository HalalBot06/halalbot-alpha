  "answer": "QUESTION\nregarding the question 8759, if we make jama'at at home then Is it necessary to make azan for each prayer and if we dont make azan then would it be a sin? and can a woman(my sister) call aqamat or i have to call aqaamat too?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo call out the Adhaan is Sunnat-e-Muakkadah. Hence, it is necessary to call the Adhaan even at home. However, if there is Adhaan given in one?s locality, it will suffice.\n\nA woman may not call out the Adhaan or Iqaamat. This has to be done by a male. (Tahtaawi pg.160)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
