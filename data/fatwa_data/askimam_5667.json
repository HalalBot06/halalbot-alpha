  "question": "severe gender dysphoria q.5501 - Phsycotherapy doesnt cure such a person properly, ... even then the person is feminine in nature... what should be done?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMore questions in reference to your reply to question number 5501. See details.\"Narrated Ibin Abbas (May Allah be Pleased With Him). The Prophet (Shall Peace and Blessing be Upon Him) cursed effeminate men (those men who are in the similitude (assume the manners) of women and those women who assume the manners of men). And he said, \"Turn them out of your houses.\" The Prophet (Shall Peace and Blessings be Upon Him) turned out such and such man, and 'Umar turned out such and such woman.\"[Sahih Bukhari; 7:774] How does this apply to males with severe gender dysphoria referred to the answer to the question no 5501. 2). Phsycotherapy doesnt cure such a person properly... and the abstinance from activities advised and the encouragement of male-oriented activities in reply no 5501... may be achieved,,, but even then the person is feminine in nature... what should be done?? Just to clarify... this condition was noticed from his childhood, thus the man didnot turn to it but was suffering from it ever since he was a boy. 3). Will he be a sinner if he doesnot commit any immodest/illegal sexual acts... but is a person who guards his modesty? Please clarify openly as this matter is really worriying. JazakAllah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ & A: Is a Sex-Changing Operation Permissible?%0D%0A%0D%0ATranssexuals are such people who believe in their minds that they are%0D%0Atrapped within the bodies of the opposite sex. Those who are physically male%0D%0Abelieve in they are actually females and they want to be females physically%0D%0Aand demand operations to change their sex organs to suit their mental%0D%0Afeelings. Many of them resort to committing suicide if they do not have the%0D%0Anecessary sex change operations.%0D%0A%0D%0AQ: Is it permissible for them to undergo these sex change operations? Is it%0D%0Apermissible for Muslim physicians to perform these operations?%0D%0AA: In terms of Islamic Shar'i Principles, there is no way that a woman or%0D%0Aman (irrelevant of whether medical science classifies such people as%0D%0Atranssexuals or whatever) would be permitted to undergo a sex-change%0D%0Aoperation in order to change his%2Fher Allah-given gender status that of the%0D%0Aopposite sex.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah has created each human as a member of a specific gender, male or%0D%0Afemale. If he%2Fshe now undergoes an operation to transform him%2Fherself into a%0D%0Amember of the opposite sex, he%2Fshe would be flagrantly violating many%0D%0Ainjunctions and commandments of the Qur'an and Hadith.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn order to protect and preserve the identity of each gender, Shari'ah has%0D%0Agone to the extent of even prohibiting males and females from merely%0D%0Aemulating members of the opposite gender, in their dress and appearance,%0D%0Aetc. How then would Shari'ah tolerate complete sex changing operations?%0D%0AHadhrat Mufti Mahmood Hasan Saheb Gangohi rahmatullahi alaihi has%0D%0Aemphatically mentioned its prohibition (see Fatdaa Mahmudiyya, Vol. 5, Pg.%0D%0A163].%0D%0A%0D%0AThe following hadith is noteworthy in this regard: \" Rasulullah Sallallahu%0D%0A'alayhi wasallam cursed those men who emulate women and also those women who%0D%0Aemulate men.\" [as narrated by Bukhari. (Mishkat, Pg. 380)].%0D%0A%0D%0AFurthermore, undergoing a sex-change operation would tantamount to altering%0D%0Athe natural and normal features, organs and attributes given to a person by%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala. Altering and tampering with the creation of Allah Ta'ala for%0D%0Athe sake of undergoing a sexual transformation should hence be totally%0D%0Aforbidden. The prohibition of altering Allah-given normal feature and%0D%0Aattributes is labelled by the Qur'an as being a ploy of Shaytan, as the%0D%0Afollowing ayah of Surah Nisa illustrates: (Shaytan said): \"And I will%0D%0Amislead them, and I will create in them false desires; I will order them to%0D%0Aslit the ears of cattle and to deface features and attributes created by%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala then warns people who fall prey to the ploys of Shaytan):%0D%0A\"Whoever, lakes Shaytdn as a friend, while forsaking Allah, has surely%0D%0Asuffered a loss that is manifest.\" (Surah Nisa, ayah 119].%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Sa'eed Motara"
