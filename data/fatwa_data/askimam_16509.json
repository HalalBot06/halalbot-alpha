  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhile Iam at office it happens some times gas comes out from my private part. is this makes Ghusal obligatory .\n\nPlease answer this question as due to this I have missed my Sallaths.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nGas invalidates wudu. It does not invalidate ghusl. There is no need to make ghusl. Simply perform wudu and observe salat.\n\n(Fatawa Mahmodiya, Vol.5. Pg.62. Dar Al Ifta  Jamiya Faroukqiya Karachi)\n\nAil Bin Talaq (Radiallahu Anhu) relates that Rusulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) is reported to have said; “When anyone of you passes wind in salat then, he should terminate  salat, perform ‘wuzu’ and repeat his salat”. \n\n(Abu Dawod, Vol.1. Pg.27. H.M Saeed)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Safraz Mohammed,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
