  "question": "Can I combine Dhur and 'Asr salat? Or is it better to make qadhaa the 'asr salat and then pray Maghrib?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)I am a teenager and I am studying at school in France. I come back to my house at afternoon and I can perform the Dhur salat but soon after I go back to the school and I cannot perform the 'Asr prayer. And when I finally come at the end, it is time for maghrib. Considering that I am hanafi, Can I combine Dhur and 'Asr salat? Or is it better to make qadhaa the 'asr salat and then pray Maghrib? 2) The punishement in the grave last 3 days and then the soul goes in the sky but I heard that when we pass salam to them at any times, they answer to our salam. Does that mean they go down to answer us, or they're always in the grave? Please clarify this.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. It is not permissible to join 2 Salaats in the Hanafi Madhab. It is possible for you to carry a small travel prayer mat to school and perform your Asr Salaat there. We should understand the importance of reading Salaat on time. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] mentioned that for reading one Salaat out of time, a person can go to Jahannum for 8- years of the Aakhirat (approximately 200 million years of this world.\n\n2. The punishment in the grave lasts right till the day of Qiyaamat. The soul remains inside the grave.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
