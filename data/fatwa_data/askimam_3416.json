  "answer": "QUESTION\nAccording to Shari'ah, is it permissible to be an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and charge a service fee considering the fact that it might be used in immoral and unlawful activities?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nInternet is a modern technique of communication and its use is not\nprohibited in Shari'ah. Therefore, charging a service fee is not prohibited.\nThe using of the Internet for some unlawful activities does not render all\nthe Internet Services as prohibited. It is similar to a tape-recorder which\ncan be used for both permissible and prohibited activities. The person using\nthe internet and tape recorder will be responsible for using them for\nunlawful activities.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
