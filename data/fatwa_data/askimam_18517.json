  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to find out if it is permissable to listen to Uwais Qadri's naats and Hafiz Nisar Ahmed Marfani's naats?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIn principle, if a naat or nasheed comprises of any sort of musical instrument or vocal sounds of music, it will not be permissible to listen to them. Similarly, if the naats convey and express concocted beliefs and ideologies, it will also be prohibited. Generally, those naat and nasheed artists’, whose beliefs are of a concocted nature, express their erroneous beliefs in their naats.\n\n \n\nThe Darul Ifta is currently conducting a detail research on issues relating to naats, nasheeds, etc. which will be posted on the website. We will try email you a copy of the same, Inshallah! We are also investigating the naats of Owais Qadiri and Hafiz Nisar. \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\nMl.
