  "question": "Can I take a Loan from a bank if I intent to pay the interest using the interest that the same bank gives me on my account?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Mufti; I have read that you gave fatwah that the interest on a bank account could be used to offset the interest on a loan from the same bank; my question: If this is my intent can I take a loan from the bank ? Baraka Lahou Bikom\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nThe wisdom behind the referred Fatwa is to merely dispose of the interest in\nthe very avenue it was obtained from. It certainly does not imply that one\ncan deliberately obtain an interest bearing loan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
