  "question": "If the majority of the people in ones locality follow a particularijtihad, is it permissible to go along with this ijtihad simply to avoidfitnah.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe Imam is going to combine the prayer because of rain, you arethere and do not want to cause fitnah by leaving the Salaat- Is itpermissible to pray? Would you prayer be accepted?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nObviously, by you not following the Madhab of your Imaam and the majority of\npeople in your Masjid, your procedure of Salaat is different from theirs.\nJust as those differences are not causes of Fitnah, not joining them in\nJamaa' bayna salaatayn (joining two Salaats) should not be a cause of Fitnah\nas well.\n\nHowever, if it is strongly perceived to be a cause of Fitnah, you may join\nthe congregation with the intention of Nafl Salaat and perform Esha Salaat\nindependently in its appropriate time.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
