  "question": "What verses in Quran deal with death, life, abortion, and euthanasia?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am writing a research paper on bioethics from a Quranic perspective. The issues I intend to discuss are about death and life; specifically, the definition of these as described in Quran. I need help finding verse dealing with: life, death, abortion, and euthanasia. I know the Quran may not specifically address these issues but any verse that might even slightly deal with these issues are needed. Can you help me find such verses or direct me to some website or book that my deal with these issues. (So far, here is one example: [16:4] He creates man out of a [mere] drop of sperm: and lo! this same being shows himself endowed with the power to think and to argue!) Jazakullah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Kindly refer attached\n\n2. Q: Is Euthanasia permissible or not?\nA: Active euthanasia where patients may end their lives by, for example, lethal injection is not permissible under any circumstances. Passive euthanasia where patients may withhold treatment or artificial life-support is only permissible if a trustworthy specialist feels that there is no hope of survival. (Bahas-o-Nazar; Fiqh Academy, India)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
