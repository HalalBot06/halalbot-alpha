  "question": "I fear I did not do good Tarbiyyah of my child and he committed suicide",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am an ordinary Muslim working in a good organization/post by the sheer grace of Allah . I do follow Islamic tenets as much as possible. I used to teach my late son (only child) for same also. He used to pray salat, Allah knows the best. Nowadays I am under severe distress due to mysterious death (killed & then hanged or suicide ) of my son (only child) of 23 years, was studying in Engineering (2nd yr.). All my well wisher Alims console me with the followings, Quote 1. U have nothing to do with his death as hayat(span of life) was destined by Allah 2. U need not go/think in the cause of death.\n\nHe will get level of sahid 3. U will get niamul-badl(better return) Unquote In Quran I have read (Theme - Life and death is from Allah) -3.156 It is Allah that gives life and death 3.154 Say:\"Even if you had remained in your homes those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death\" 2.155 (Theme-Allah will test the Believer's belief)\n\nWe shall surely test your steadfastness with fear and famine, with loss of property, life and produce. Give good news to those who endure with patience ButI am very much pained as very often my mind boggles on the cause of death fearing if it was suicide, as it is prohibited in Islam and emanates very wrong signal to the society (Hindu & Muslim). I also fell pained/guilty if not done proper tarbiyyat(upbringing) of my son.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu 'alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nYou could be faced with two situations regarding your son. You could, with the will of Allah, either be with your son or without him and gain the reward of Allah. Your son could also be faced with two situations with the will of Allah. He could be either with you or enjoy the blessings of Allah. Surely, the better in both situations, for you and your son is that Allah is better for your son than you and the thawaab of Allah is better for you, that your son being with you. Your son is also fortunate that he has a surviving father to make duaa for him. Most definitely your duaas for your son are accepted.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
