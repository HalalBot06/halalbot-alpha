  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAs a sufferer of obsessive compulsive disorder I regularly fall into depression. Recently whilst on Hajj and suffering from one such bout, I uttered the following: \"I can't take this anymore, I don't want to be here, I want to go home and I don't feel like praying.\" I have since done tauba but am concerned as to whether these utterances have resulted in kufr and also invalidated my nikah. Iam very anxious and would be grateful if you would advise as to my position.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAll these statements do not constitute Kufr and do not invalidate your Nikah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
