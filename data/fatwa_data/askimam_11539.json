  "question": "Does a musallah deserve the same amount of respect as shown in a musjid?What is the view of talking about worldly affairs in a Musallah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn our university we have a musallah where 5 daily salaah are NOT performed.We also use it for study purposes.Posters displayed say that one is under the curse of Allah and becomes the enemy of Allah if worldly affairs are discussed in the Musjid.What is our position in this regard as we discuss issues pertaining to our studies with colleagues and also eat here as there is no other suitable place where muslims can enjoy a meal on campus.Students who are not punctual with their salaah are being deterred from using the Musallah because of these notices.Jazakallah!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe laws regarding a Musallah is not like those governing a Masjid. Since a Masjid is \"Waqf\" (Endowment) it has many extra laws. However, we should be careful and act respectfully in places wherein Salaah is performed, just as it is imperative in classrooms where knowledge of Qur'aan and Hadith and Deeni knowledge is imparted.\n\nThere is no doubt that abstinence from vain talks is required from a Muslim, where ever he may be. Allah Ta'Allah describing a believer's qualities states: \"Those who abstain fro vain talks\". A Hadith states: \"A sign of Islam's beauty in a man is that he abstains from what does not concern him.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
