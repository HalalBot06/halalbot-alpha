With the changing of time and the advancement of technology, it is possible that the Fuqahaa have not commented on them. It is the responsibility of the Ulama to look into those principles laid down by the Fuqahaa and find solutions to those queries. Therefore, there is no stagnation in Ilm. Allamah Shaami mentions there is much research that the former ulama have left for the latter.\n\nWe only respond to Fiqh related queries. We do not respond to dream interpretations.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai\nStudent: Darul Ifta\n\nChecked and Approved: Mufti Emraan Vawda"
