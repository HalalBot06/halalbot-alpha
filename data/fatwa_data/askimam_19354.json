  "question": "I am thinking of starting a home business. I would like to know if it permissible to sell women's clothing?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am thinking of starting a home business. I would like to know if it permissible to sell women's clothing - such as the ones worn in India and Pakistan? What if ladies who buy from me dont do parda? What if they wear clothes with fitting and half sleeves in public? Should I consider other options or will the responsibility of bey-pardgi be theirs alone to bear? I dont want to be held accountable for my customers' sins. Similarly, may I gift friends with perfume when I know that they will wear it in public and in the presence of non-mahram?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nIt is permissible for you to sell woman’s clothing and perfume. The income will be halal. If women use the clothing in the wrong way, by not concealing their form and shape of their bodies with a loose garment or by applying perfume and going to a public gathering, they will be sinful. You will not be sinful for their wrong doings.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best,\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
