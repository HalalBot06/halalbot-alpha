  "question": "What are the orders of Shar'iah regarding the chicken and meats cooked and served in Saudi Arabian restaurants?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThese stuff are imported from New Zealand and Australia. They claim that these stuff is butchered there in accordance with Shar'iah. Many ulemas and mashaaikh do not eat these in Makkah and Madinah, during Hajj and Umrah time. Is it permissible to eat that? I would be highly obliged for your guidance.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to our observations, chicken meat in the Holy lands is obtained and slaughtered locally as well as imported. The local meat is Halal and can be identified by the 'al-Watania' packaging.\n\nImported chicken meat comes from many other countries besides New Zealand and Australia. People have witnessed chicken in boxes marked from other countries, for example, Holland. Since we are not certain whether all the chickens imported are slaughtered according to Shar'iah or not, it will not be permissible to consume any of the imported chickens. This is also the advice of many prominent Ulama residing in the Holy lands.\n\nAnd Allah Taala Knows Best.\n\nBy Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
