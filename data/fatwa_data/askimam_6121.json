  "question": "Can we touch and see the sex organ of a wife.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There are two aspects to your query; a) Permissibility, b) Morality.\nIslam encourages morality. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said,\n'Imaan and shame are companions. When one is lifted, the other is also\nlifted.' We are encouraged to display modesty during intimate relationships.\nIt is immodest for the husband and wife to look at one another's private\nparts.\n2. It is permissible for the husband and wife to arouse one another by\ncaressing the sensitive organs of one another.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
