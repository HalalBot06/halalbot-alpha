  "question": "Did the Prophet (SA) ascend the 7 heavens on the 27th Rajab?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalaamualaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuh. My dear mufti brothers, my question is about me'raaj. i would like to know if nabi (saw) ascend to the heavens on the 27th of rajab. Can you please provide me this from quran and hadith. Is there any practice or reward to be done on the 27th of rajab, or to have a talk on that night in the masjid etc? Please provide me the above with full details. Your soon response will be highly appreciated. Your brother in islam. Wassalaam.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nA common belief is that the Prophet (SallAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) ascended to the heavens on the 27th night of Rajab. Even thought there are a few narrations that confirm this view there are other narrations that relate other dates. There is no clear evidence on which night or month the Meraj actually took place. Al-Zurqani (Rahmatullah Alayh) has mentioned five different opinions on the months in which the Meraj took place; Rabi-ul-Awal, Rabi-ul-Akhir, Rajab, Ramadan, and Shawwal. Allama Abdul-Haq Muhadith Dehlawi (Rahmatullah Alayhi) goes on to mention that most of the scholars are of the view that Meraj took place in either Ramadan or Rabi-ul-Awal.\n\nThe fact that there is no specific date mentioned shows us that there was no special merit in doing special acts of worship specifically on the night of Meraj. Had there been any special merit then surely the companions of the Prophet (SallAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) would have surely recorded it. The companions of the Prophet (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) preserved every aspect of the life of our beloved Prophet (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam). Surely, they would not have left out any special practice or worship that was to be done on this night. However, any confirmed ibadaat (worships) that are advised in other nights such as salah, reading the Quran, dhikr, etc. should be done without the belief that it has more merit on this night. \n\nFinally, to give talks in the masjid in order to forbid from evil and to invite towards good is not only recommended but rather a deed that deserves reward. On this night it is common for people to gather in masajid in large numbers, therefore, Ullama take this as an opportunity to inform and educate the people about this night.   \n\n(Fatawa Mahmoodiya, 3/ 283-285, Farooqiyah)\n\n(Islamic Months, 49-63, Ma’arif)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
