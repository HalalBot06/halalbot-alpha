  "answer": "QUESTION\ni would like to know..if we can keep aside zakaat money for some body every year..and the give that person the entire amount after a few years in lumsum for his daughters wedding coz we know that that person would need the money at that time.. i am avoiding to hand him the money right away because we know this person would not save the money but spend it right away coz he has been an irresponsible person and may not be able to handle the money well..and i want to save this money for his daughters wedding..\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn order for Zakaat to be discharged, Tamleek must take place. Tamleek means\nto hand over ownership to a poor and needy person. In the enquired case, if\nTamleek does not take place and you keep the amount with you with the\nintention of giving the full amount after a few years, the Zakaat will not\nbe discharged.\n\nIn order to achieve your objective, you may offer the Zakaat to his\ndaughters directly if they are adults (reached puberty) and responsible. You\nmay advise them to save the money and also offer them to keep the money for\nthem. If they agree, the money will belong to them and your Zakaat will be\ndischarged.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
