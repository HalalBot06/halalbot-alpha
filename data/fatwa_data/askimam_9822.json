My uncle knows where the ring is but does not want to give it to me ? also they have money as they stay in hotels all the time ? Please tell me what should I do.....\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf your uncle?s wife stole your wife?s ring, then she has committed a major sin. In one Hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) says, ?A person does not steal whilst he%2Fshe is a believer.? (Bukhari). Abdullah ibn Abbas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) explains the above quoted Hadith that the light and noor of Imaan comes out of the heart when committing such a sin. (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is indeed unfortunate for a Mu?min to be void and empty of the light of Imaan. Such a heart is filled with darkness which will become manifest on the day of Qiyaamat (judgment) when every individual will be in dire need for the light of Imaan for eternal salvation. To be void of the light of Imaan on the day of Qiyaamat leads one to eternal destruction in hell. May Allah Ta?ala save us from that, aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0AA dweller in hell will offer his entire worldly possessions to be freed from hell and it will not be accepted. Does it behove a person to go to hell just for a ring? In principle, if the thief has the actual stolen item by him or her, it must be returned. If he%2Fshe does not have the item, the thief must recompensate the owner the value of the item. %0D%0A%0D%0AIn an Islamic state, if the thief is convicted of Saraqa (stealing), then his%2Fher hand (wrist) will be severed. Such a hand does not hold any value. The respect for people?s wealth is an integral part of our Deen. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised in his farewell hajj, ?Behold, the wealth of others is prohibited upon you, like the sanctity of this place (Makkah), this day (10 Dhul Hijjah).? (Bukhari)%0D%0A%0D%0AWe advise the woman to make Tawbah and return the ring. It is better for her to bear the disgrace in this world, than the punishment in the hereafter. If the woman does not return the ring, we advise your wife makes Sabr. Her stolen ring will be a means of charity and reward for her in the hereafter. Do not take any actions as the woman is a close relative ? uncle?s wife. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Whosoever discards a dispute, I guarantee him%2Fher a place in the centre of Jannah.? (Tirmidhi)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
