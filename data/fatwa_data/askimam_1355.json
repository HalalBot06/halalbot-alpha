  "question": "I am almost 40 years old and want to do Hifz al Quran. Can I still do iteven this late in life?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat if I dont finish hifz during my lifetime? Also what are the rewards of doing hifz? JazakAllah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe position of a Hafiz in the sight of Allah is indeed very high and lofty.%0D%0AHis heart is actually chosen by Allah to preserve the Qur'aan. His mind is%0D%0Ailluminated with the brightness of the Qur'aan, his heart is perfumed with%0D%0Athe fragrance of the Qur'aan.%0D%0A%0D%0AFor every alphabet of the Qur'aan he had recited, he earned a minimum of ten%0D%0Arewards. The maximum reward is best known by Allah. The Qur'aan has 6666%0D%0Averses. Every verse has many alphabets. Imagine the number of alphabets a%0D%0AHaafiz recites. On an average os 3 alphabets per verse a Haafiz will recite%0D%0Aapproximately, 20 000 (twenty thousand) alphabets in the entire Qur'aan.%0D%0AThat multiplied by ten rewards per alphabet is 200 000 (two hundred%0D%0Athousand). In the course of memorising the Qur'aan, a Haafiz makes great%0D%0Asacrifices. He recites one verse very many times. If he had recited one%0D%0Averse at least 10 times, the reward of completing the Qur'aan only once will%0D%0Abe two million. Imagine how many times thereafter, a Haafiz recites the Qur'%0D%0Aaan, how many Taraawees he performs, the rewards of all that is far beyond%0D%0Aour very limited comprehension. Probably, mathematival figures will be%0D%0Aexhausted but not the infinite rewards of Allah Ta'ala for a Haafizul Qur'%0D%0Aaan. In conclusion, consider the following Ahaadith:%0D%0AHadhrat Abdullah ibn Amr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) will say to a Haafiz (upon his death and on%0D%0Athe day of Qiyaamat) 'Recite the Qur'aan and (upon reciting each Verse)%0D%0Aclimb (a stage in Jannah) and continue reciting as you used to in the world%0D%0Aas your abode in Jannah is upon the last verse you recite.' (Mishkaat vol.1%0D%0Apg.186; Me'raaj)%0D%0A%0D%0AObviously, the Hafiz will stop at the last verse of the Qur'aan. The%0D%0Acommentators of Hadith have stated that the highest abode in Jannah is%0D%0Aequivalent to the number of verses in the Qur'aan. Therefore, upon%0D%0Acompleting the recitation of the Qur'aan, a Haafiz will be in highest abode%0D%0Aof Jannah.%0D%0A%0D%0AMu'aadh al-Juhani narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Asaid, 'Whosoever recites the Qur'aan and practices upon its injunctions, the%0D%0Areciter's parents will be given a crown on the day of Qiyaamat. The%0D%0Abrightness of that crown will be more intense than the brightness of the sun%0D%0Ain your actual house.' Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) further%0D%0Asaid, 'What do you think will be given to the Hafiz (reciter) of the Qur'aan%0D%0Ahimself?' (Ibid).%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
