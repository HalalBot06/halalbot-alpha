  "question": "Should I to make up few prayers as a precautionary measure or I should increase the quantity of nafil salaat",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am 30 yrs old and have been praying since the age of 7 years. In the early age, if I miss any prayer, I used to offer the Qaza and sometimes I did not. Then I realized that it is necessary to offer Qaza if the salaat is missed. Now I don't remember when I realized it, whether before or after maturity. I have pondered a lot but I can't remember the exact time and for how many prayers I did not offer Qaza. Under such condition what should I do? Should I to make up few prayers as a precautionary measure or I should increase the quantity of nafil salaat so that if there is any deficiency in farz it could be compensated with nafil?\n\nIf a husband or wife does not protect his/her gaze from seeing what is prohibited in Shariah, is he/she violating Huq-Ul-Ibad also? In case if he/she repents then should he/she supposed to ask forgiveness of his/her spouse too? On the day of resurrection could any person ask to Allah Subhanao Wa Taala about his spouse whether he/she had protected his gaze or not?\n\nWas Salam Wr Wb\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. You should apply your disretion on how many Fardh Salaats you may have missed after becoming baaligh and make Qadhaa Salaats for those Salaats only.\n\n2. If a spouse has casted a lustful glance on the opposite gender who is not a Mahram, then that is a major sin. That is also violating the rights of the spouse as well as the person on whom the lustful glance was casted.\n\n3. On the day of Qiyaamat, every Muslim would want his sins to be concealed by Allah. It will be the grace and special favour of Allah upon an individual for his sins to be concealed on that day.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
