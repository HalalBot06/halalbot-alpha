  "question": "Can I use Zakat and Interest money to build a boundary wall around the house in which my sister and brother are living?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy parents have passed away several years ago. My father had a house that is not surrounded by boundary wall. We are 5 sisters and one brother. My brother (36 years old) is unemployed and depends on sisters for his livelihood. Now my brother and one of my sister are living in that house. As there is no boundary wall, the house is open for stranger people that is very unlawful in the viewpoint of women’s purda.  But they have no money to construct the boundary wall. I have some money in the bank and zakat is also fardz for me. May I use the zakat money and interest money raising from bank for the construction the boundary wall?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nMay Allah reward you for wanting to help your siblings and constructing a boundary wall for them. Ameen.\n\nYou may give Zakat money to your sister and/or brother if they are not Sahib Nisaab.\n\nA Sahib Nisaab is one whose surplus wealth equals 612.35 grams of silver, its equivalent in cash, funds, or anything made of gold or silver (i.e. jewelry, ornaments, utensils, etc.) which has been in their possession for a year or more.1\n\nThey also cannot be from amongst the descendants of Bani-Hashim, the clan of Rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam).2 If they are descended from Bani-Hashim, then you should assist them through your regular savings or wealth.\n\nYou can also have the boundary wall built on their behalf with the Zakat money. However, this must be accompanied by an unconditional and real transfer of ownership of the boundary wall to the recipient of the Zakat. They should then be entitled to use it or dispose of it as they wish.3\n\nIt is forbidden, impermissible and a great sin to earn interest. You should transfer your account as soon as possible to a non-interest bearing account at your bank.\n\nAs for the interest money that you have already accumulated, you may give it to one or both of your siblings if they are eligible to receive Zakat without the  intention of seeking reward.4\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\n \n\nMl.
