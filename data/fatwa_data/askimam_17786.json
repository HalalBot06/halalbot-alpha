  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nInsha allah i will be married to a girl in a few months. I believe i cannot wait that long as my work environmment is so seductive that i am likely to fall into Sin. i want to kow that if there is any excuse in shariah to perform nikkah with  the same girl twice. The girls parents and my parents will witness the first nikkah and the second nikkah will be witnessed by everyone in my family, followed by the Valima i cannot perform the nikah rightaway a my relatives live abroad and they would gt upset if i get amrried in their absence. moreover i fnd it difficult to control myself.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nIf your parent and the girl’s parents agree on the Nikah, then the nikah should be performed. There is no need for a second nikah. The family should be educated on the simplicity and the formalities of nikah.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
