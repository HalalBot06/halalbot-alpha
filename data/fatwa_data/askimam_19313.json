  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have recently started a job but I find it to be very demanding and stressful. I also get very tired from my job, and because of this have started to regret getting the job. However, my family have a lot of debts that we need to pay off very soon, and I can't lose this job. My job also means that I have to interact with males and females, and this makes me very sad because I know free mixing is not allowed in Islam. However I keep my intentions clean and I desperately need this job to survive and to also support my family financially. Is there any dua that I can say to make me feel less stressed at my job, and more happy? Is there something special that I can say in my dua after salah that will take away my tension and difficulties? My job also involves meeting clients wih mental illnesses whilst I'm alone. Is there any dua that I can recite before going to meet the client alone, that will keep me safe?\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\n \n\nJazakillah for writing to us. Sister, correct me if I am wrong.\n\n \n\nThere are several issues you raise in your questions below. It appears that you are anxious and uncertain at the moment. According to my understanding (after  reading your email), I get the impression that you lack confidence in facing the challenges your profession presents to you. This is understandable since you may lack experience as you have just started the job. Do make a point of  asking your supervisors to help you when you need the help. It is better to admit that you sometimes need help / advice than to go on struggling and  making mistakes which can erode /decrease your confidence and self-esteem further. Since you mention that you work with clients with mental illnesses, all the more reason that you should make a point of discussing your concerns and anxiety with your supervisor.\n\n \n\nCould it be that you are also facing personal challenges and this is adding to your anxiety and uncertainty?\n\nIt is advisable to seek help for your personal issues  also. If you continue to ignore your own needs and problems, you could just find yourself unable to cope as the challenges at work will increase. I also suggest that if you find that you continue to feel stressed out in this environment, it may be better to seek a similar job where you do not have to be alone with clients and where the demands of the job are less until you are ready to do the present work. If you have to speak to the opposite sex during the process of your work, keep it firmly business like. Don’t allow yourself to talk freely, keep to the work issues only and be conscious of your responsibilities to yourself and remember Allah Ta’ala’s commandments.\n\n \n\nI suggest that you read Surah Yaseen  every morning and evening. Also make a point of reading Ayatul Kursi as often as possible as it is a protector against shaitaan and evil. I do hope that you are punctual with your salaah, increase your zikr and reading of the Quran in English as it is a protector and guide in all circumstances.  May Allah Ta’ala pour His mercy and Rahmah over you and ease your difficulties, ameen. You may write again if you wish.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nSister Fadila,\nB.A. (Sociology & Psychology) Unisa.\nSocial Work (NDP) Unisa.\n\nContact :    031 207 6483\n082 833 9755\n\nDurban, South Africa\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
