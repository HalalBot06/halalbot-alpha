  "question": "To secure our house of evil spirits once and for all, a pious (shiâ€™rkless) Alim has provided some nails to be nailed into the corners of the house. Is this practice Shariahtically acceptable?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHe has recited and blown something onto the nails, and had mentioned that he has to spend almost one night (few hours) per nail. He is a Hafiz of Qur?an, and I?ve never seen him talk or commit Shirk. He said that the nails were an allowed channel (zari?ah), and the real powers to protect lie only with Allah s.w.t.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSome Amaliyaat (practices of the Aamils) are based upon experience. What you describe in your question is also one of their practices and acceptable in Shari?ah provided there is no Shirk involved.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
