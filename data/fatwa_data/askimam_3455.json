  "question": "Making up missed rakaats in salaat, joining late, and sajda sahw.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf a person joins the salaat late, and forgets to get up to complete their missed salaat, what should the person do? If, after making salaam with the Imaam, the person looks to one side and then remembers his error and gets up, completes his salaat, with sajd-e-sahu, is his salaat valid?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYes, his Salaat is valid. The condition in this instance is that his chest\nmust not turn away from the Qiblah. If this happens, or if he talks, then\nhis Salaat will break and he will have to repeat.\n\nand Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\n1. A person who has missed any Rakaat and then joined the Jamaat should\ncontinue the Salaat with the Imaam to the end. Once the Imaam turns to say\nthe second Salaam, the Masbooq should stand up and complete the missed\nnumber of Rakaats.\n2. If the Masbooq has missed two Rakaats in Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr or Esha, he\nshould complete both the Rakaats by reciting Surah Faatiha and another Surah\nin both the Rakaats.\n3. If the three Rakaats were missed, the Masbooq should stand up and read\nSurah Faatiha and a Surah in the first Rakaat. After Sajdah (before standing\nfor the second Rakaat he has to make Qa’adah – sit down – read Tashahhud and\nthen stand for the second Rakaat. In the second Rakaat, he should recite\nSurah Faatiha and a Surah. Complete the second Rakaat without sitting for\nTashahhud. In the third Rakaat, read only Surah Faatiha and complete the\nSalaat. Note: in the first Rakaat of the Masbooq (late comer) will recite\nThanaa, Ta’awwudh, Tasmiyah, Surah Faatiha and a Surah.\n4. The Masbooq should recite the complete Tashahhud (Attahiyyaat) only. A\nsimple rule completing missed (whether you joined the Imaam in the third or\nfourth Rakaat), when you will stand up (after the Imaam make his second\nSalaam. Your first Rakaat which you will be making up for will be the first\nRakaat you have missed with the Imaam. So first, offer those Rakaats in\nwhich there is Qiraat and then those which do not have Qiraat (Surah after\nSurah Faatiha). As for the calculation of the Rakaats, it should be done\nwith that which was made with the Imaam. Then calculate in pairs\naccordingly."
