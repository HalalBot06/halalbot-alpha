No, you cannot marry your wife's sister's daughter until you are divorced from your wife and she finishes her iddah or she passes away. [i]\n\n\n2.) If you do marry your wife's sister's daughter while you are married to your wife, then that 2nd nikāh will not be valid and any relations with your wife's sister's daughter would be zinā (adultery).\n\nYour nikāh to your wife will not be affected and will remain intact.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMl.
