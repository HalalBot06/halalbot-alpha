  "answer": "QUESTION\nMarriage I am only 20 years of age and eventually I want to marry a girl who is good in deen and is really good looking with excellent manners, not just a girl with looks and arrogance. How do you find such a girl according to shariah when shariah prohibits a man to see a non-mahram women. Are we just allowed to look at girls wearing hijab because nikab is not fard and most girls wear hijab and jilbab but not niqab?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn Islam, it is permissable to look at the girl whom he proposes marriage\nto, he is allowed to look at the face if she is in Niqaab, as stated in the\nHadith, Ibn Shubah asked for a woman in marriage and Nabi (sallallaahu\nalayhi wasallam) asked if he had seen the woman, he replied 'no', he\n(rasulullah sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said \"Then look at her it may\nproduce love between you....\"\n\nSo from the above you can look at the prospective girl, but this must done\nin the presence of a Mahram.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nShaykh Irshaad Amod\nfor: FATWA DEPT."
