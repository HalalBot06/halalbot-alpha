  "question": "Is it permissible / advisable for a son and his wife to perform hajj before his parents ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissible / advisable for a son and his wife to perform hajj before his parents ?\n\nIs it better if he send his parents first before thinking of himself ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn principle, if a person has the financial means to perform Hajj, then it is compulsory for him/her to perform Hajj immediately. Therefore, if a son and his wife, and his parents have the financial means to perform Hajj, then all should do so immediately. It is not a matter of first and thereafter. It is an issue of an immediate Shar’ee obligation. There should be no delay in that as death is imminent. If there are political difficulties in all going for Hajj immediately, then preference should be based on Shar’ee obligation.\n\nIf the parents have the means to perform Hajj and the son does not have the means, then obviously the parents should be preferred. The same should be in the case of the son. If Hajj is compulsory on both and all cannoy go at once, then it is bet to make Mashura and decide from there.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
