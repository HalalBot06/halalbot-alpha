  "question": "Is it permissible to have quran recitation going on from the computer?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissible to have quran recitation going on from the computer, when the family members of the house can talk, which conflicts with the recitation?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nIndeed the Qurān has a very high and lofty status in the life of every believer. Undoubtedly the Qurān is the word of Allah Ta’ala which has been revealed onto the heart of the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) via the medium of the noble Angel, Jibrāeel (alaihis salaam). Thereafter it was passed on to the Sahabah (radiyallahu anhum) who preserved it by memorising it and recording it on whatever little means available. More than 1400 years have passed and this same method is being adopted. It will be absolutely correct to say that the Qurān in its present form as we recite it today is the very same way it had been revealed to the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam).\n\nIt is a common fact today that in most places of the world the Qurān is being neglected and due importance is not given to reciting or listening to Qurān. It is also a sad reality that respect for the Qurān lack in the life of many Believers.\n\nAs far as the virtue of reciting the Qur’an is concerned, the Prophet (salallahu alaihi wasallam) is reported to have mentioned:\n\n  قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول الرب تبارك وتعالى من شغله القرآن عن ذكري عن و مسألتي أعطيته أفضل ما أعطي السائلين وفضل كلام الله على سائر الكلام كفضل الله على خلقه (سنن الترمذي ,ج2 ص120,سعيد)\n\nAllah (the most glorified, the most high) says: “Whomsoever the Qur’an occupies him from making my dhikr (remembrance) and asking from me, I will grant him better than those who asked, and the virtue of the word of Allah (Qur’an) over all other words is like virtue of Allah upon his creation” \n\nقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم من قرأ حرفا من كتاب الله فله به حسنة والحسنة بعشر أمثالها لا أقول الم حرف ولكن ألف حرف ولام حرف وميم حرف (سنن الترمذي ,ج2 ص119,سعيد)\n\n \n\n“Whoever recites one letter from the book of Allah (Qur’an), he will receive one reward and every good deed is multiplied tenfold. I do not mean ا ل م is one letter, but ا is one letter, ل is one letter and م is one letter”\n\n\n\nAs far as listening to the Qur’an, once the Prophet (salallahu alaihi wasallam) requested Ibn Masood (radiyallahu anhu) “Recite some portion of the Qur’an”. Ibn Masood (radiyallahu anhu) replied: “should I read to you whilst the Qur’an has been revealed onto you?”  The Prophet (salallahu alaihi wasallam) said: “indeed, my desire is to hear it (i.e. Qur’an) from someone other than myself”. Thereafter he recited from the beginning of Surah Nisaa until he came to the verse “how will it be when we bring a witness from every nation and we bring you as a witness against them”. When Ibn Masood lifted his gaze, he observed that the blessed eyes of the Prophet (salallahu alaihi wasallam) were tearing. \n\nThe Qur’an has tremendous powers to transform our hearts, but it will only affect our hearts if we read and listen with the correct zeal and enthusiasm. Otherwise, the Qur’an will play in the background, we will take enjoyment, but very little affect on the heart.\n\nVery often, the Qur’an is playing on the CD player, in the car or on the computer whilst we pay no attention to the recital of the Qur’an, talking and making noise.\n\nIt is the quality of the disbelievers to make a hue and noise whilst the Qur’an is being recited hence, the Qur’an does not have a positive impact on their hearts. It is mentioned in the Holy Qur’an:\n\nوقال الذين كفروا لا تسمعوا لهذا القرآن والغوا فيه لعلكم تغلبون (41:26)\n\nAnd the disbelievers said: “do not listen to the Qur’an and rather make noise, so that you do not get overpowered (i.e. by the words of the Qur’an)”\n\nAs much as we love to listen to the Holy Qur’an and to play it wherever we may be, we should also keep in mind our surroundings and show utmost respect to the recitation. If we are in such a place that it is almost definite that noise will be made and disrespect will be shown to the Qur’an we should rather not play the Qur’an then, but when it is appropriate to do so. For example, if a person is with his family and everybody is talking, then one should not put on the recitation of the Holy Qurān. However, if everyone is silent and will attentively listen to the recitation, then one should listen to the Holy Qurān.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
