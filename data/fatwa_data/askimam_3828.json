When one limb (of the body)%0D%0Acomplains, that effects the entire body by being awake and having fever.'%0D%0A(Mishkaat pg.422; Qadeemi)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadith 2%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Musa (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) said, 'A believer to a believer is like a building that%0D%0Astrengthens one another (with each brick).' (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadith 3%0D%0AHadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) said, 'A Muslim is a brother of another Muslim, so do not%0D%0Aoppress him and do not hand him over (to the mercy of the enemies when he is%0D%0Ain trouble).'

Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) accepted his request and%0D%0Asent seventy Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) who were Qurraa (experts in the%0D%0Arecitation of the noble Qur'aan).
