  "question": "Hennah and black dye",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. I would like to inquire whether Glory Brown Hennah and Glory Black hennah is permissible for men to use on their hair (beard, head) 2. Nowadays people are making hennah type mixture. They make it out of sugar and flour. They burn this two ingredients and make something like hennah. This is used by ladies on their nails. The colour is similar to hennah. It does not form layers on the nails. It is just like using hennah. Is it permissible to use this mixture? I will be very grateful for your assistance.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We do not have any info on the ingredients of the two products mentioned, thus, we cannot comment.\n\n2. Pure black dye is not permissible. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, \"There will be people who will come later (in my Ummah) and apply black dye. They will not even smell the fragrance of paradise.\" (Abu Daawood). However, it is permissible for a Mujaahid (warrior) to apply black dye in order to give the impression of being young. (Jawahirul Fiqh vol2 pg421)\n\nTo dye the hair any other colour besides black e.g. Mehndi or Katm (type of grass) is permissible. This was the practice of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) and the Sahaaba (Radhiyallaahu Ánhum). (Jawahirul Fiqh vol2 pg421)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
