  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is the significance in Islam of having father's name as baby's second name or it is just an arab tradition. My baby name is Abdullah and his father name is Imran, please suggest which one is appropriate Abdullah Bin Imran or Abdullah Ibne Imran or Abdullah Al Imran.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nWhen calling a person, it is not necessary to call him by his name and his father’s name. It will suffice to call him only by his first name.\n\nAccording to shariah, one should not negate his attribution to his father by attributing himself to another person, thereby creating an impression of that person being his father. It is in that regard that Allah says, “Call them (children) by their fathers’ (name) that is more appropriate for you in the sight of Allah”.\n\nThis verse was revealed when the sahaba used to call Zaid (RA) as Zaid ibn Muhammad whereas Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) was not the father of Zaid (RA).\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
