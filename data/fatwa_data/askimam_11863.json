  "question": "How much interaction is allowed with the non-muslims in their states?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow muslims should live in a non-Mulim state i.e Governed by the Non-muslims. There are lot of things which are almost impossible to avoid in such an environment e.g to see Non-mehram women, sometimes talk to them or hand shaking with them, music,parties where other people drink Alcohol etc. As we are part of such a society (as student) so we have to keep some connection with the ppl of such society. Islam is dynamic Deen and it could be practiced anywhere in the world. So how should we react to them and which activities of them we can paerticipate in?. As we have to propagate the message of Islam showing from ourselves, then should we remain reserve? There are lot of brothers who have gone to extremes in these environments. Kindly guide in this regard in detail because lot of Muslims in such states are facing many conflicts in deciding what to do and what not to do. If you can support your answer with references it will good to convince other brothers.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. No doubt, you are forced to interact with non-Muslims in your daily life. However, this interaction should be within the confines of the Shari?ah. Yes, you may invite them towards Deen without compromising your Deen. Joining non-Mahram women, speaking to them unnecessarily and shaking hands with them is strictly prohibited in Islam. The Qur?aan and hadith are replete with these prohibitions.\n\n2. No, you are not allowed to participate in any of their Haraam activities. A haraam will remain Haraam irrespective of the noble objectives attached to it.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
