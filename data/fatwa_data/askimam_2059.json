  "question": "Does having one's self dirty invalidate wudu.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDirty -- for example from digging in the dirt, painting, from dust, oil, sweat from hard work, etc. If the wudu is not invalidated, then is it recommended? What about washing parts of the body not in wudu? For example, there may be sweat or dirt on the person's back or chest.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDirt does not invalidate the Wudhu. Thus, it is not necessary to repeat the\nWudhu.\n\nIn Salaat, one is directly conversing with Allah Ta'ala. Just as one does\nnot feel it appropriate to meet a person of high worldly standing in the\nstate of being dirty, to a far greater degree, should one respect the honour\nof standing before Allah Ta'ala. Thus, it will be the correct etiquette to\nremove all dirt before Salaat, whether the dirt is on the limbs of Wudhu or\nany other limb.\n\nNonetheless, should one perform Salaat in a state of being dirty, from such\nitems that are not Najs (ritually impure), the Salaat will be valid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
