  "answer": "QUESTION\nplease comment and prove it that this in not allowed by all the four Imams Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to Imaam Abu Hanifa (RA), two Salaats (Dhuhr and Asr, Maghrib and Esha) cannot be performed together in one time with the exception of the day of Arafaat.\n\nHowever, according to other Imaams, when travelling, a Musaafir may join two Salaats (Dhuhr and Asr, Maghrib and Esha) in one time. Both views are based on academic proofs. If you are a Hanafi, you should adhere to the Hanafi Madhab. People following other Madhabs should follow the ruling of that Madhab. There is no need to refute the practices of the other Madhaahib.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
