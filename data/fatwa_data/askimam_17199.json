We recommend that you find a close-by mosque where you can offer at least a few prayers daily and the Jumu’ah prayer on Fridays. This will give you the opportunity to interact with the Muslims and benefit from the Islamic environment. Every Muslim needs an Islamic environment to recharge and maintain his iman. Once you find a mosque you should be able to get in touch with a scholar or imam who could guide you further. Kindly inform us of the state and suburb you are in so that we can send you the addresses of a few mosques near-by.\n\nAs far as your queries are concerned; the body of a dog is not impure, only its saliva is impure. Hence, if the dog’s body touches your body or clothes, you do not have to wash it. However, it will be a different case if there is some impurity on the dog’s body. If, however, the saliva of the dog besmears your body or clothes and the besmeared area is more than three centimetres in diameter, you will have to wash the besmeared area before you can offer any salat.\n\nOne may offer the salat in any place including the house of a non-Muslim as long as the place on which salat is being offered is pure of all impurities (such as urine, stool, semen, etc.). However, if the impurity is of an excusable amount (less than three centimetres in diameter), there is no harm in this. The “place on which salat is being offered” refers to that place where the feet are placed and also those places which touch the ground when in sajdah, i.e. wherever the knees, hands, and forehead are placed. If the carpet or floor is impure you may spread out a clean sheet and pray on it.\n\nIn Victoria, Tasmania and New South Wales the Qiblah is towards the west approximately. If in Northern Territory, Western Australia or South Australia then face West of North West when praying (face West and turn slightly to the right). For the exact direction of Qiblah from your location have a look at: www.qibladirection.com\n\nBahishti Zewar vol. 1 pg. 43, 147\n\n\n\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\nMl.
