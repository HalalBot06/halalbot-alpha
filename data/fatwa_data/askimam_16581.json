  "question": "Is it true that Muhammad (SAW) never gave azaan? & is the reason mentioned in the above a valid reason? if not what was the reason of Muhammad (SAW) never calling out",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n\"Woh Konsa Kaam hai jis k karney waley ko Allah ?(SWT) buhut pasand karta hai magar Hazrat Muhmmad (SAW) ne woh kaam nahi kia. Answer: Muhammad (SAW) ne kabhi azaan nahi di thi, quon k agar Aap (SAW) azan daitey to shayad kainat ki her cheez masjid mein aa jati aur nizam - e- kaynat tabah ho jat.\"\n\nIs it true that Muhammad (SAW) never gave azaan? & is the reason mentioned in the above a valid reason? if not what was the reason of Muhammad (SAW) never calling out azaan?\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nRasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) used to be the Imam. He appointed some Sahaba to call out the Azaan. It is not recorded that Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) called out the Azaan.\n\n \n\nThe reason explained for Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) not calling out the Azaan has no basis. If that was the case, the mission of Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) could be easily fulfilled by him giving one Azaan and all his enemies would come to the musjid.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
