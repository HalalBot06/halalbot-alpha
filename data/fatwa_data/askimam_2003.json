  "question": "Place of employment does not offer facility for prayer.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Imam Sahib, I am faced with a dilemma. I will be moving to a new house which will be quite far from work therefore, I will not be able to perform my Zuhr salat. Presently, I just walk home for my Zuhr salat. My employer does not offer any feasible place for offering my prayer. I don't want my salat to be qaza either. Is there a particular dua I could perform to obtain assistance in this matter which is of deep concern to me? Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe do not understand what you mean by 'any feasible plan'.\n\nIf your employer does not offer you such a place, you should search for a\nsuitable place anywhere in and around your employment place and perform your\nSalaat. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, '(The speciality of\nmy Ummah) is that the entire earth is a Musjid (place for prayer).'\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
