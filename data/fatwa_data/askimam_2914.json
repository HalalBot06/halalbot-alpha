  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Imam Sahib as salam alay kum wa rahmat allai wa barkathu, I own 500 shares since 1995 that time I purchased @ 40 indian rupees each since that time it doesen't reach that price now the current price (1st May 2001) is only 10 rupees I am incurring losses on these shares. How can I calculate Zakat on these shares. every year i.e., from 1996 to 2001. I have 3 pieces of land (plots) the first one where I am constructing my home this year inshaallah, the other 2 plots I purchased it as investment but not for reselling (for my children) I want to hold these for my children's future need, should I have to pay zakat on it? thanks, Jazak Allah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer our standard reply on queries on Zakaat on shares - below\n\nThere is no Zakaat on any one of the three pieces of land.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nQ: If one owns 40% of shares in a company, then how is Zakaat calculated on\nhis share?\nA: If the company is a trading investment then Zakaat is payable on the\ncapital amount as well as the dividends. If the company is not a trading\ninvestment and only receives income, for example from rentals of properties\nthen Zakaat is liable only on the dividends.\nIn this case, as a shareholder of a trading investment, Zakaat is due at\n2.5% of the 40% shareholding on the capital, as well as on the dividends."
