If there are two witnesses to the proposal and acceptance of the boy and girl, the Nikah is valid. The presence of the Wali is not a requirement for the validity of the marriage. The same ruling applies to the Nikah of a divorcee.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
