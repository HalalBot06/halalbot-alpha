  "question": "Authenticity of this Hadith",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n\nRecently I received the following mail. Would like to know the authenticity with reference(s).\n\n\n\nA Beautiful Hadith\n\nRasoolullaah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) said: 'When a man dies and his relatives are busy in funeral, there stands an extremely handsome man by his head. When the dead body is shrouded, that man gets in between the shroud and the chest of the deceased.\n\nWhen after the burial, the people return home, 2 angels, Munkar and Nakeer(names of two special Angels), come in the grave and try to separate this handsome man so that they may be able to interrogate the dead man in privacy about his faith. But the handsome man says, 'He is my companion, he is my friend. I will not leave him alone in any case. If you are appointed for interrogation, do your job. I cannot leave him until I get him admitted into Paradise '.\n\nThereafter he turns to his dead companion and says, 'I am the Qura'an, which you used to read, sometimes in a loud voice and sometimes in a low voice. Do not worry. After the interrogation of Munkar and Naker, you will have no grief.\n\nWhen the interrogation is over, the handsome man arranges for him from Al-Mala'ul A'laa (the angels in Heaven) a silk bedding filled with musk.\n\nRasulullah (Sallalloho alaihe Wa-aalay wasallam) said: 'On the Day of Judgement, before Allah, no other intercessor will have a greater status than the Qura'an, neither a Prophet nor an angel.'\n\nPlease keep forwarding this 'Hadith' to all ...because Rasoolullaah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wasallam) said:\n\n'Pass on knowledge from me even if it is only one verse'.\n\nMay Allah bestow this favour on all of us? AMEEN AMEEN\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\nYour query contains three Ahadith. Hereunder are the verifications of there authenticity and there references.\n\n1. “When a man dies and his relatives are busy……..”\n\nThe above Hadith is portion of an extremely long Hadith that is recorded with two chains of narrators.\n\nThe first chain of narrators lead up to Ubadah Bin Saamit (radiyallaahu anhu). This Hadith is recorded in Tanzihu Al-Shari’a, Al-la aali al-Masnoo’ah, Al-Du’afaa (Uqaili) and other books of Hadith as well. However, the Muhaditheen have questioned the authenticity of this Hadith.\n\n The second chain of narrators lead up to Mu’az Bin Jabal (radiyallaahu anhu). This Hadith is recorded in Al-Bazaar, Al-Targheeb and other books as well. There has being discussion amongst the Muhadditheen regarding the authenticity of this Hadith, however no one has classified it as “fabricated”.\n \n\n2. “On the day of judgment, before Allah……”\n\nThe above Hadith is recorded in Ihyaa, Maqasid Al-Hasanah and other books of Hadith as well. We could not find a ruling of any Muhadith on this Hadith. Furthermore, this Hadith is recorded without a sanad (chain of narrators) which makes it difficult to comment on its authenticity. All we could find was that Hafidh Iraqi mentioned that this hadith was narrated by Abdul Malik Bin Habib from Sa’eed Bin Sulaim, Mursalan.   \n\n3. Pass on knowledge from me………..\n\nThe above Hadith is authentic and is recorded in Sahih Al-Bukhari. (#3461)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
