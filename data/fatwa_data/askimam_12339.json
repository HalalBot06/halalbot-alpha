  "question": "Can we get the gold back after a broken engagment?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAlsalamu Alakum There is this girl we were planning on getting married too. We are not married yet, in any shape or form. We did buy the gold, etc.... During the past few weeks we have found out some things that the girl and her parents have kept from us. They are very deceptive people and I have learned this person is not suitable for me. My question is do we get the gold back? Or does she keep it? We?ve been told by someone that we won?t be getting it back. But we haven?t gotten married Islamic or otherwise. Jazakallah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe gifts given to the prospective bride (fianc√©e) belongs solely to her.\n\nOnce she or her representative like her father, brother, etc. gained possession of the gifts, they belong to her. You cannot demand them back from her. Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] is reported to have said, ?One who takes his gift back is like a dog who socks on its own vomit.?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
