  "answer": "QUESTION\nI had a question about the Nadwatul Ulema. It seems that many of the Ulema from this institution are Salafi inclined in their Aqeedah and Fiqh. This can be seen from many of them attending Madinah University for further learning, or being part of organizations who advocate that particular belief (ie. ISNA). So I wanted to know where exactly do they differ, and why do they usually fall into the blanket statement of having Deobandi background if they have a different maslak?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nI am not in a position to comment on the Ulama of Nadwatul Ulama. You may contact the institute directly and raise your concerns with them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
