  "question": "Is it permissible to decorate a house during a wedding? Or stay at a relatives house for a week during a wedding. They are going to have Indian tradtional parties (saachak and mehndi).",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) Is it permissible to decorate a house (for example light the house) during a wedding? 2) Is it permissible to stay at a close relatives house for a week during a wedding. They are going to have Indian tradtional parties (saachak and mehndi) in the house but they have told us that we dont have to attend them while we're there. We should come and stay at their house to share their joy. We were thinking it is not permissible. Please tell us what we should do. Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Nikah should be simple. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said,\n'The most blessed Nikah is that in which least expenses are incurred.'\n(Mishkaat vol.2)\n\nIf the feeding referred to is the Walimah, there is no need to delay the\nWalimah by 2 or 3 days. It is Sunnah to have the Walimah the next day after\nthe union between the husband and wife.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
