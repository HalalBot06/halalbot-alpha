  "answer": "QUESTION\nMay Allah assist you in all that is good, may He carry out the work of Deen through your hands and may he grant you that which is best. I came across an amazing book entitled Fadl al Bari by Allama Shabbir Ahmed Usmani which is an commentary of Bukhari. I was overawed by the depth of scholarship, the way complex issues were presented in a simple manner and the fact that this book was available in English. This book is published by Idarah 'Ulum-i-Shar'iyyah, Karachi, Pakistan, 1975. The copy I came across was a photo copy and it was very badly done. I have been searching for this book but to no avail. I was hoping that you would by able to inform me as to whether the translation of the other volumes have been completed? Where I can purchase the first volume and the other volumes if they are available? If there any news on whether this book is being worked on or has the translating of the unique book ceased? I hope that you can help me in this regard since such works are rarely available in the English language. May Allah reward you for your efforts and grant you the ability to see the truth in all situations and grant you the tawfiq to act and implement these truths\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nUnfortunately, as far as we are aware, only the first 2/3 volumes have been published in Urdu.\n\nThereafter, it seems that the work on this celebrated work had stopped. The reason for this is unknown to us. Although the compiler does mention in his forword that he had compiled the entire lesson of the whole Bukhari.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
