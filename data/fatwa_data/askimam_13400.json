  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat do ulemas of  deoband consider about Molana Abdul Wahhab? Do  you agree that the present form of wahhbism has nothing to do with teachings of Maulana Abdul Wahhab?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYour observation is correct. Sheikh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhaab [ra] was a reputable and God-fearing Aalim of the eighteenth century aligned to the Hanbali Madhab. Sheikh enjoyed unique acceptance and love across the spectrum of social class. Sheikh, in conjunction with the royal family of the time, was responsible for rekindling the love for the Qur’aan and Sunnah in the populace of the Arabian peninsula. Unfortunately, subsequent to the death of the Sheikh, his opponents embarked on a vehement campaign of concocting erroneous beliefs and views and attributed them to the Sheikh. This, in an attempt to discredit the Sheikh and to bring about discord between his followers.\n\nWhen these attempts failed miserably, these opponents rescinded and capitalized on the influence that Sheikh’s name enjoyed and the love of the masses. By hijacking his movement and using it as a vehicle to spread their incorrect views and beliefs.
