  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nChildren can pray and ask Allah to transfer the blessings to their parents. If so\n\nMy mother is still living. Only Allah knows whether she or I will die first. I want to pray for her now (complete the whole quran and ask the blessings to be given to her). Is it allowed. Can I tell her about it so that she will be happy.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is permissible to recite the Holy Qur’an as well as to fulfill other nafl (voluntary) actions with the intention of sending the reward to another person, whether living or deceased. It is also permissible to relate to that person that these actions are being done for their reward, as long as the intention is sincere and to not show off.\n\n \n\nوفي البحر : من صام أو صلى أو تصدق وجعل ثوابه لغيره من الأموات والأحياء جاز ، ويصل ثوابها إليهم عند أهل السنة والجماعة\n(رد المختار,2,ص243)\n\n(Raddul Mukhtar,Vol.2,P.243-HM Saeed Company)\n(Fatawa Mahmudiyyah,Vol.9,P.213-Jamia Faruqiyyah)\n(Ahsan-Al-Fatawa,Vol.9,P.16-HM Saeed Company)\n(Fatawa Uthmani,Vol.1,P.642-Maktabah Ma’ariful Qur’an)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
