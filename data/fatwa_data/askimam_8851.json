  "question": "I had put some of my personal appliances(fridge,stove,washing machine,etc) up for sale and then one person offerd to buy all of them.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHe came back the next day and said that he only wanted to buy the fridge which I was selling for 150$ but I told that he agreed to buy everything and that was the deal, afterwhich he gave me 100$ and said that he would go and talk to his wife about the rest of the stuff. He came back the next day and said that they only wanted the fridge and I refused to sell him only the fridge as he had previously agreed to everything and I had already taken down all of the advertisements I had posted. He then told me that I had to sell him the fridge as I had taken partial payment for it (the 100$) and that it was haram for me not to do so; and so I offered him back his money but he refused to take it back. Now he says that he wants to buy everything however I do not want to sell him anything as it has caused me too much trouble and I will be loosing money anyway. Could you please tell me if I have the right not to sell him anything or would that be Haram.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two aspects to your question, one is a moral aspect and the other is the Shar'ee (legal) aspect.\n\nWhen the person promised to buy all the goods, he was morally bound to fulfil his promise. But since he went against his word, he was morally wrong. Legally (Shari'ah), it was a promise and not a sale. Therefore, neither you nor him can enforce the sale. Therefore, there is nothing wrong in you not selling him any item.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
