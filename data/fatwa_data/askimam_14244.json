  "question": "What is the proof of Imam Abu Hanifah (rahamatullahi alayhi) that laughing in Salah breaks our wudhu?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. What is the proof of Imam Abu Hanifah (rahamatullahi alayhi) that laughing in Salah breaks our wudhu?\n\n2. It is mentioned in the hanafi fiqah books that if the imams are equal in their qualifications, then the one who has the most beautiful wife should be the imam. What is the reason or wisdom behind such criterion? Also, how would the people in the community know who has the most beautiful wife?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Proof for this view of Imaam Abu Hanifa [ra] can be extensively found in many books of Hadith including Musannaf Abdur-Razzaak (vol.2 pg.376) and Majmauz-zawaaid (vol.1 pg.246). This Hadith in question relates the incident of a person with an eyesight impediment who fell into a waterbody in full view of the Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhu] performed Salaat in Jamaat with Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] as their Imaam. This solicited laughter from certain quarters of the Jamaat. Upon termination of the Salaat, Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] commanded that those who had laughed aloud in Salaat should repeat their Wudhu and Salaat. (Badaaie vol.1 pg.138; Darul Kitaab)\n\n2. A person with a beautiful wife is more likely to be content with his own wife and will be less susceptible to casting evil glances and getting involved in illicit relations thereby alluding to the probability of a higher level of piety and Taqwa. The object is not that the prospective Imaam disclose the features and beauty of his wife to others. This can be easily established through blood relations, womenfolk, etc. (Raddul Muhtaar vol.1 pg.556; HM Saeed). It should be borne in mind that the preference of a personâ€™s Imaamat on the basis of the beauty of his wife will only be considered after a string of other criterion are exhausted. A situation like this may never arise in practical terms.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
