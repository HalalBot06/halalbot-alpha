  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have heard from someone that a women's ablution breaks if men see their hair. Is this true and what is the hadith behind this? I was also wondering how exactly did the Prophet (pbuh) pray Tahajjud because different books have different procedures. Sometimes in the quran, after reading a particular verse one must prostrate. I have once read that while prostrating you have to read this sura. I would be greatful if you could tell me what that sura is and is there any particular way you have to prostrate when reading such verses.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) It is not permissible for women to expose their hair in front of Ghair Mahram(not prohibited in marriage) males. That is a major sin and incurs the wrath and anger of Allah. However, if a male sees a ghair mahram womans hair, that does not invalidate her fast. It is advisable for a person to renew his/her wudhu after having committed a sin. The same advise will be for a woman who exposed her hair infront of ghair mahrom males. Such a woman should also make sincere tawbah (repent) and never the sin again.\n\n2) There are 14 places in the Quran where Sajda-tilawat becomes compulsory after reciting those verses. Those places are marked in the Quran. Sajda-e-Tilawat is performed by simply going into sajda and reciting Subhana Rabbiyal A?ala three times.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
