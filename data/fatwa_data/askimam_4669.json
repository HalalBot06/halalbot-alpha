  "answer": "QUESTION\nMolana, I am closely related to 2 sisters who are openly living with the same man & both claim that they are not living a haraam life because they claim they both made nikah with him.They both have children from him as well. Now,how are we as family supposed to treat them?? Are we even allowed to visit them?? They say it is a big sin to break family ties but how else are we supposed to treat them? To be honest, i am ashamed to tell people that i know them let alone, related to them. HELP?? Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari'ah, it is Haraam (expressly prohibited) to have two%0D%0Asisters in one marriage. Allah Ta'ala says, 'If it is made Haraam upon you%0D%0Athat you join two sisters (in one marriage).' (An-Nisaa)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Fuqahaa (jurists) have ruled that if a person married two sisters%0D%0Asimultaneously, both the marriages are invalid. If he married one after%0D%0Aanother, then the marriage to the second sister will be invalid. To live%0D%0Awith a woman in an invalid marriage is Zinaa (adultery) and a major sin -%0D%0Arefer below.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs a relative and being close to the sisters, we advise you adopt every%0D%0Apossible avenue to explain that their act is against the Shari'ah and%0D%0Ainvokes the curse of Allah Ta'ala. If applying any pressure on them, for%0D%0Aexample, severing ties with them, etc. may help them in breaking up the%0D%0AHaraam relationship, then that should be adopted.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe sin of fornication (Zina) is extremely severe, both in this world and in%0D%0Athe hereafter. Allah Ta'ala says in the noble Qur'aan, 'And do not go near%0D%0Ato Zina.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIn a lengthy Hadith of Sahih Bukhari, a dream of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) is mentioned in which he saw the punishments of different sins.%0D%0AAmong those punishments, one was the punishment of Zinaa. He saw people in a%0D%0Aclay oven with its mouth very narrow and the bottom very vast. Beneath it%0D%0Aburnt a fire. When this fire was kindled, these people went up with that%0D%0Afire and when the fire subsided, these people also then went down. In this%0D%0Aoven were naked men and women who used to commit adultery in the worldly%0D%0Alife. The punishment will continue till the day of judgment.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe punishment of Zinaa in this world is Rajm (if married) or 100 lashes if%0D%0Aunmarried. It should be borne in mind that such punishment will apply if%0D%0Asuch a sin is committed only in Darul Islam (where full Islamic rule is%0D%0Aenforced). If such conditions are found that the adulterer is married%0D%0A(Muhsan) and he committed such a sin in Darul Islam, he will be given the%0D%0Apunishment of Rajam (stone to death). If he is not Muhsan, then the%0D%0Apunishment will be 100 lashes (both male and female).%0D%0A%0D%0ASimilarly, any act which will lead to Zinaa is also Haraam, for example, a)%0D%0AUnlawful contact with a strange women, b) Illegal glances to strange women,%0D%0Ac) Filthy literature, etc. For this, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Amentioned, 'The eyes also commits Zinaa (adultery) the Zinaa of the eyes is%0D%0Aillegal glances.' (Nasbur Raaya)%0D%0A%0D%0ABesides the above punishments, the repercussions of Zinaa will be, a) A%0D%0Aperson will suffer poverty, we have noted many affluent people who became%0D%0Apaupers due to committing Zina, b) Many families are broken, c) Illegitimate%0D%0Achildren, d) Abortion, etc. etc. etc."
