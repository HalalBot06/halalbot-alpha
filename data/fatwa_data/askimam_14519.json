  "answer": "QUESTION\ni have a friend who visits a respected elder whom they have said is a so called hakim or who has a special gift to help people here in durban , what i would like to know is that he is putting preasure on me to visit this man , and also i did not appreciate certain things which he had told me regarding the jamat and stuff like that , also he told me that one should not talk bad of this so called person otherwise bad things will happen to one and he referred various other things which did not seem to something someone good would do? and this person it seens has a very large group of people who flock to him for all preoblems , please advise?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYou do not have to succumb to the pressure of your friend and visit the person in reference.\n\nIn principle, if the person practises and beliefs are against the Shariâ€™ah, it should be condemned. In this instance, one should not fear anything will happen to him for condemning the wrong. In fact, it is compulsory for one to condemn a wrong and it is an act of great reward and blessings to do so. The large following of a person engaged in un-Islamic practices and beliefs is nothing but a deception of the Shaytaan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
