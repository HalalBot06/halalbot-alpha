  "question": "1) If someone makes a request to pray for the Maghfirath of their relative, what Du?aa should be recited? (2) Similarly how does one pray for someone?s health or expeditious recovery?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI believe the Duaa's go like this?.(1) Allahumma maghfir hu wa adkhil hu fee Jannah??(2) Allahumma ashfi mardaana??but I may be totally off. Please state the meaning AND THE RELATED AHADITH for each of the two Du'aas.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Du'aas stated by yourself are correct.\n\nHowever, in the first Du'aa, it is better to say, 'Allaahumma ighfir lahoo\nwar hamhu wa adkhilhu fil jannah.' The meaning of the first Du'aa is, 'O\nAllah forgive him, have mercy upon him and enter him into paradise.' The\nsecond Du'aa means, 'O Allah cure the sick and ailing from amongst us.'\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Hussain Mehtar / Moulana Imraan Vawda\nfor: FATWA DEPT."
