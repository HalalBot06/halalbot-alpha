  "answer": "QUESTION\nkindly elaborate on zina, is kissing smooching and hugging considered as zina? or is the insertion of male sex organ in to female's considered as zina?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are many different levels of Zina.\n\nThe highest and the worst type would be sexual intercourse and it is to this type that the punishment of stoning or lashing will apply.\n\nLooking at a female who is haraam to one, listening to her voice without necessity, speaking to her, touching her and walking towards her are all forms of Zina and are sins albeit lesser than intercourse.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
