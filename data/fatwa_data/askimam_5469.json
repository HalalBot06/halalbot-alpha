  "question": "Why aren't woman allowed into a graveyard? And is it true that the dead see woman naked and unclothed?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nForgive my ignorance. I am a new revert. I was told that woman may not enter a graveyard because the dead (particularly the dead men folk) can see you naked and thus woman cause the dead to sin by being in the graveyard. Now forgive me but I am an intelligent, educated woman and this sounds like a superstition to me. And when I suggested it to the woman folk and men folk alike, I was told that I don't know what I am talking about and I should just believe what they tell me as they know best. I have since read on this site that the reasons why woman are not \"allowed\" into graveyards has nothing to do with the dead being able to see you naked, but that The Prophet (SAW) forbide woman from entering a graveyard for their own safety. Please can you give me some sort of reference that may suggest that what I was told and made to believe is the truth, as I am still sceptical and have my doubts. Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nImam Bukhari has recorded a Hadith of Sayyidatuna Umm Atiyya (Radhiallaahu Anha) that she said, 'We were prohibited from following the Janaaza, i.e. until the graveyard.' (Bukhari Hadith No.1278; See Fathul Baari vol.3 pg.187)\n\nImam Tirmidhi (RA) has recorded a Hadith of Sayyiduna Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has mentioned, 'May Allah Ta'ala curse women who visits the graves.' Imaam Tirmidhi has graded this Hadith as Sahih - authentic (Sunan Tirmidhi vol.1 pg.203) A similar narration is recorded by Imaam Abu Dawud on the authority of Sayyiduna Abdullah ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhu).\n\nHowever, many of the scholars are of the opinion that the above law has been obliterated by the following narration recorded by Imaam Muslim in his Sahih on the authority of Sayyiduna Abdullah ibn Mas'ood (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) mentioned, 'I had prevented you from visiting the grave, (as of now) you all should visit it for it reminds one of the Aakhirat.' (Sahih Muslim)\n\nBased on this, the previous law mentioned above was abrogated. Hence, the permissibility of visiting the graveyard includes males and females. However, the reason for prohibiting females from visiting graves is due to our corrupted environment wherein women who do not adhere to the laws of Hijaab and hence strange men are attracted towards them. Therefore, it is not permissible for young females to visit the graveyard.\n\nHowever, if the laws of the Shariah (Hijaab, intermingling, crying, etc.) are not violated then the prohibition may be set aside. Since generally the women visiting the graves are not free from the above aspects, they should refrain from doing so.\n\nIf a female visits the grave to remember death and soften without crying . there is nothing wrong if they are old. It is Makrooh (not permissible) if they are young (Shaami vol. 1 p. 665 - Maajidiyya) See Umdatul Qaari vol.8 pg.69\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
