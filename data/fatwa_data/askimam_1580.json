  "question": "Can you have photos in a closed area, like a cupboard or picture album?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI read from another website (Islamicity) that photos are the same thing as mirrors reflecting your image. The ayaat that says something along the lines of 'whoever tries to imitate my creation, will have a great punishment' does not necessarily say photographs and videos are haram.. And if the hadith 'Angels do not enter the house with a dog or images' refers to all images, wouldnt that make tv and computers are haram too? Doesnt it mean the display of photos?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPicture frames and photographs of animate objects are not permissible to%0D%0Adisplay. Frames having pictures of inanimate objects e.g. trees, mountains,%0D%0Aetc. are permissible.%0D%0A- Hadhrat Abu Talha (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) narrates that Nabi (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'Angels do not enter a house wherein there is a dog%0D%0Aor picture.' (Mishk%E3t vol. 2 p. 385)%0D%0A- %C1bdullah ibn Mas%F3od (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) narrates that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'The people with the most severe%0D%0Apunishment by Allah will be the picture makers.' (Ibid).%0D%0A- Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (RA) narrates, 'I heard the messenger of Allah saying,%0D%0A\"Every picture-maker will be in the fire. A life will be created for every%0D%0Apicture the picture-maker made, and he will be tortured in Hell.\"%0D%0AIf you have to make pictures (says Ibn Abbaas) then make a picture of a tree%0D%0Aor such things which are inanimate.' (Bukhari and Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe ruling is the same whether the photos are in a cupboard or in an album.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
