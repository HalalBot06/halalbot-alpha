  "question": ", My father has two houses, the day he dies one house goes to my brother and one to me. Is this acceptable if not please advice",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nBut he says i can only inherit my house after something happens to my mother, as i am already married, and his money is not to be shared only after my mother dies, and thereafter my brother gets half and i get half not 2/3 and 1/3. F or him to want to share his things this way is it acceptable, and can i take half of his share even if daughters are only allowed 1/3.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is incorrect to make such a bequest.\n\nUpon the death of your father, all his property will make up part of his\nestate. This estate will be distributed according to the Islamic Laws of\nSuccession and Inheritance. Also, the condition that 'his money should not\nbe shared only upon the death of your mother' is definitely not acceptance\nin Shari'ah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
