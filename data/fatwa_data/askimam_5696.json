  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalaamulaykum, Now I am 16 years old, I have made many mistakes, I have had a relationship with a girl, Nothing sexual went on, We kept it clean, The most we ever accomplised was kissing, and that was once, I fell in love with her, At such a young age, She fell in love with me, We broke up because she felt guilty, she felt guilty because she could not tell the truth to her mom, enter the masjid with a horrible sin such as this. I respected her desicion and I had no choice but to agree with her departure, We stil talk, We still feel the same, I still love her, She still loves me, I am too young to marry, I respect her values, Her family, her heritage, and her most of all, I am trying to make a change, How do I get her off my mind? Is there a dua that I can read? I am trying brother, to make a change, I just need some guidance, Jazakallahu Khairun\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour zeal to change is commendable. For that, you require courage and\nedication. Nothing can be achieved without that.\n\nTo associate with the opposite gender illegally is Haraam and detrimental to\none's spirituality. In many instances, it leads to addiction. Many married\nmen don't seem to be content with their wives. That is due to the bad habit\nthey adopted. One must suppress his desires against every evil. We advise\nyou terminate your relationship with the girl and have nothing to do with\nher. Make sincere Tawbah for associating with her and make a firm intention\nnever to associate with any girl. Be punctual with your five times Salaat\nwith Jamaat. If there are pious people in your area, associate with them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
