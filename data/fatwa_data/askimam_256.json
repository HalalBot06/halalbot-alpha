  "question": "I read that one of the signs of judgement day is women being subordinates to their husbands.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDoes this mean that women have no value in Islam?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer to our article, 'Equality and Status of Woman in Islam' at http://www.jamiat.org.za/isinfo/ewomen.html The purpose of Hijaab is not to frustrate a female. It is to protect her chastity. She may exit her house and visit friends and family, etc. To frustrate a female by closing by closing her in the house all day long is un-Islamic. And Allah Ta√£la Knows Best. Was salaam Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
