  "question": "contraceptive patch.. if I am in a state where gusl is valid on me, should I take the patch off for gusl to be accepted or can I leave it on?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. I had asked regarding contraceptive patch.. my question is, to state it more clearly, if  I am in a state where gusl is valid on me, should I take the patch off  for gusl to be accepted or can I leave it on?\n\n2. My husband sometimes has clients who delay in making payments for his consulting services. This provides inconvience for us. Would charging late fee be considered as interest or would it be jaaiz?\n\nThank you for the great website and its comforting to know your questions can be answered here. Please remember my family in your duwas. Jazak Allah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. In Fardh a ghusal (bath) it is necessary that water reaches every portion of the body. If the water does not reach every portion of the body the ghusal will be incomplete. The contraceptive patch prevents the water from reaching skin therefore will not be permissible to wear. However, if the women has been advised by a reliable doctor to use the patch and there is no suitable alternate, she will be excused from using the patch.\n\n2. charging late fees on outstanding amounts is interest and not permissible. As an alternate your husband could word the document in a way that could read \" if this account is paid by x date the amount will be xyz and if the account is paid by x (later date) the amount will be xyz (higher amount). In other words it will mean if you pay by an earlier date you would enjoy a discount otherwise you will have to pay the full fee.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
