However, if the woman does not have any children, and his taking care of the husband and the home, then she may proceed to work but with conditions like there must be women only like in an all-girls school, nursery school and the life. %0D%0A%0D%0A2. Your question is not clear. Islam does not prohibit women from doing business only on the basis that it is within the Shari?ah, e.g. there is no mixing with non-Mahram or doing business with Haraam items. Women can get into businesses like, dressmaking, which is restricted to women and brings a healthy income.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. According to the Shari?ah, the beard of a man %2F Imaam needs to be one fist long. If it exceeds this length, he is permitted to trim the beard to make it to that level.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
