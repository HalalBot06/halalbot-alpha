  "question": "What is the ruling of Slavery in Islam? How can a person be a slave to someone other than Allah SWT.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease explain the concept of slavery in Islaam. Is it alowed in this day and age? If there was an Islamic government then would slavery be allowed. Please explain te issue in detail as we are not knowledge in the islamic rulings.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah is our creator and ultimate Master. We, as his creations and slaves%0D%0Aare obliged to express our servitude to Him Alone. If one does not submit%0D%0Ahis slavery to Allah, which of course is far more heinous and unjust to%0D%0AAllah in comparison to the 'injustices' of slavery and sexual relationship,%0D%0Aetc. by a human master.%0D%0A%0D%0ASince the human being did not willingly submit to the ultimate Master,%0D%0AAllah, He condemns them to the unwilling slavery of his sincere slaves. And%0D%0Aby understanding the powers of a man master, they may understand the Powers%0D%0Aof the True Master, Allah. In fact, the concept of slavery should be%0D%0Aregarded as a concept of mercy, as the heinous crime of rejecting Allah as%0D%0Aour Master demands immediate terminating of life. Allah, our kind Master,%0D%0Ahas granted an opportunity to his very negators to enjoy a second chance of%0D%0Alife and redirect it to the right avenue by submitting to Him as the%0D%0Aultimate Master.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
