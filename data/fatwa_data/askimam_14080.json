  "question": "Thoughts of believing in many gods",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nHi, one time in school while I was stretching with my hands up in the air, my teacher said a word that sounded like Zeus, the Greek god in Greek Mythology, and my mind started to mess with me and made me think as if I was stretching my hands up to praise Zeus. Did I really commit shirk or worship a false god?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYou are a Muslim. You believe in the Oneness of Allah. You do not believe in Zeus. Your concern stems from the fact that your stretching of hands coincided with the teacherâ€™s pronouncements of Zeus. That is not Kufr or Shirk.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
