  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have planned for reciting the full quran, so everyday i recite 3-4 pages.. but at one time, i gorogt to wear my head cover. it was ony after i finished reading that it came to my notice.. do i have to recite again the pages that were read that day???\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nYou do not have to repeat reading the pages you read while having your head uncovered. However, to have ones head uncovered while reading to Quran is against the honor and respect of the Quran. The Fuqaha have mentioned that it is wajib for one to honor and respect the Quran. \n\nرجل أراد أن يقرأ القرآن فينبغي أن يكون على أحسن أحواله يلبس صالح ثيابه ويتعمم ويستقبل القبلة لأن تعظيم القرآن والفقه واجب.\n(الفتاوى الهندية، 5/316، رشيديه)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
