  "question": "Could I be allowed to communicate with my fiancee through email?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nBismillah Hirrahman Nirrahim Assalamu Alaikum Dear Brother, I am from India and working now in US. I am engaged to girl in India. I have her photo which I often see. Our engagement was held on December, 2000.Insha Allah, our marriage is scheduled to be held on May 2001. One of my friends in US told me to have correspondence with her, so that both can know each other. So, I asked permission from her father and talked to her over phone. I thought I will speak to her only once and then I will meet her in the marriage hall. But, we are having regular Email and telephone correspondence. But I could not control now. I am now totally confused with these communications. I kindly request you to clarify me in these regards and kindly inform me the rulings in these matters: - 1. Whether I can have my fiancée photo with me? 2. Can I have correspondence with her through Email? 3. Can I have correspondence with her through phone? 4. Can I kiss her over telephone, when talking to her? 5. Can my fiancée have correspondence with my brothers? 6. What should I do for all that I have done till this time? Do I need to ask Taubah? 7. Could you please tell me the Hadith, which says that the marriage should be held immediately after the engagement and within how many months? Waiting eagerly for your kind reply. Jazakallahu Khairun Khateeran. Warm Regards, Wassalam. Yours loving brother.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe concept of fianc%E9e where the boy maintains an informal relationship with%0D%0Athe girl proposed in marriage is the influence of the western culture and is%0D%0Aunfounded in Islam. According to the Shariah, every type of pre-marital%0D%0Arelationship, communicating through e-mail, telephone etc. is strictly%0D%0Aprohibited. Besides the Shar'ee prohibition, there are many other negative%0D%0Aconsequences to pre-marital relationships. In our experience in dealing with%0D%0Asimilar cases, we have observed the following%0D%0A1) Since the boy and girl are not formally committed to one another through%0D%0Amarriage, and have no experience of life, they engage in such discussions%0D%0Athat lead to disputes, thus breaking the proposal.%0D%0A2) Pre-marital intimacy takes place. In many cases the boy abandons the girl%0D%0Aafter having conceived, leading to abortion and many other heartaches.%0D%0AIn order to avoid the negative consequences of pre-marital relationships, we%0D%0Aadvise that upon the acceptance of the marriage proposal, the elders of both%0D%0Aparties should expediate the early performance of the Nikaah. Islam is a%0D%0Asimple religion and advocates simplicity. A simple Nikaah is sufficient to%0D%0Afulfill the purpose of the proposed union.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai %0D%0A%0D%0A"
