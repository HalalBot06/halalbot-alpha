  "question": "After manually slaughtering a chicken, Muslims tend to pluck the chicken's feathers but some put slaughtered chicken in hot water to remove the feathers mechanically. Is this procedure halal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMost halal grocery stores in California, USA tend to sell chicken that is slaughtered according to the Islamic way however, they tend to put the slaughtered chicken in hot water containers to ensure that the feathers are mechanically removed. They say it's cost effective however, per my understanding, isn't this wrong? I always ensure that when I buy chicken, I make sure that the feathers are plucked by someone rather than putting the chicken in hot water. Please advise me as to what is correct per Islamic laws. Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible to mechanically remove the feathers of chicken by placing\nthem in hot water. However, the plant should ensure that the water is no so\nhot that the impurities of the chickens penetrate into the flesh of the\nchicken.\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
