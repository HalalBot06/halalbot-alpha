  "answer": "QUESTION\nIt gives me great pleasure and honour in askng my question. Im currently a student in a university.Im here at times from 8.00 in the morning till 5.00 in the afternoon.The toilets here are all high toilets. There is a Jamaat Khana flat toilet but most of the time it is out of order and seriously dirty and blocked when in opperation. What is the best way for me to use the university toilets (high toilets)?? May Allah reward you in your efforts. yours Sincerely Student\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf you are light in built, then it will be better to squat by placing the feet on the toilet seat. It is important to ensure that one cleans the seat after doing this to avoid causing inconveniencing others.\n\nHowever, if you are heavy in built, and are unable to squat, then after ensuring the toilet seat is clean, you may sit on the toilet seat. Toilet paper should be placed in the pan to help minimize the splashes.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
