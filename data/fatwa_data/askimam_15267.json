  "question": "Purchasing from Rupee to Dollars",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n\nLets say I go to a Shariah compliant bank and open an account. My account is in (Pakistan) Rupees. The bank gives me a VISA debit card. I go online and purchase something for (lets say) 100 dollars inclusive of shipping charges from a buyer in some other country. Since the purchased item is in dollars, the money deducted from my account uses a currency exchange rate. Please tell me if such a transaction is permissible. Jazaakullah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nYour bank is in. You purchase an item in dollars. Your bank will have to convert the rupees into dollars and pay the company abroad on your behalf. That is permissible.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
