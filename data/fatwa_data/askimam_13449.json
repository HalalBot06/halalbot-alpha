  "question": "Can Fazal E Amal or any hadith book like Barista Zahwar or bukari or muslim (other hadeth books) be read without Wadhu",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan Fazal E Amal or any hadith book like Barista Zahwar or bukari or muslim (other hadeth books) Â be read without Wadhu or it is compulsory to make wadhu before touching and reading it as it contains the verses of holy quran.\n\nOne more thing that i want to know is that if the quran is on the website is it compulsory for making wadhu for reading it as we are not touching the holy quran physically but we are reading it through internet and computer. What is the judgement on the above two cases.\n\nJazaka Allah khair.\n\nYour guidance is highly appreciable.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is Mustahab (preferable) to read these books with Wudhu. However it is not necessary. (Nurul Iddah Pg. 17) It is not necessary to be in the state of Wudhu when reciting the Quraan and not holding it physically.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
