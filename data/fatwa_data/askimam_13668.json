It is not permissible to work in a bank in view of the fact that their principle business is dealing in Haraam. As proof, we refer you to the verses of the noble Qur’aan wherein Allah commands the believers not to deal in interest and makes a declaration of war against those who refuse. (Surah3 Aayat130). However, we advise that your brother remain an employee of the bank until he finds an alternate sustainable employment.\n\n2. The gift received from your friend should be given away to the poor and needy.\n\n3. If a bank conducts its business according to the Shari’ah, then it will be permissible to accept employment at such a bank.
