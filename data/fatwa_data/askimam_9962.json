  "question": "I require your help to interpret a dream. what does dreaming of mice/rats and killing them in such a dream mean?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have been dreaming for 1year where i see mice/rats in my dream. now i dream that i kill these mice/rats. I dream that they are in my house. Most of my family members are present in these dreams. At first I didn?t think anything of these dreams,I laughed at dreaming such nonsense.The dreams at 1st started with one mice, then one became two, two became three and so on.the number of rats/mice increased and they created havoc in the dream.My family never noticed these mice only I could see the havoc they were causing.Again I thought unusual to dream such nonsense. Then these dreams occurred daily (every night without fail dream)I read somewhere that if a person dreams about mice/rats then this person will come into contact with an ?evil? woman (please correct me if I am wrong). Lately my dreams have become slightly disturbing.before I only dreamt rats/mice in the house, now I am dreaming that I kill these rats/mice yet when this happens I feel that I have killed a human being.when I kill the mice I don?t view it as an animal. I view it and feel that I have killed a person/human. The feeling I have when killing this animal is not of remorse but of fear and the consequences I am going to suffer at the hands of others.I say ?others? as I don?t know if I am fearing other mice/rats or humans.I simply have an overwhelming fear of some punishment/retribution to come my way! Can you please interpret this dream for and advise if this dream has any meaning to it. Adam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe required dream has no significance and is the whispers of the Shaytaan.\n\nYou should ignore the dream and recite your Masnoon Du'aas before sleeping.\nIf you see such a dream in future, spit lightly three times, recite, 'Laa\nhawla walaa quwwata illaa billaah' and change directions. Don't fear at all.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
