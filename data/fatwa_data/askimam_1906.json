What can recommend the imam to us to be pure or how we can purify ourselves ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou have asked a very important question and for that we commend you.\n\nAllah Ta'ala sent Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) with four great\nresponsibilities, one being, Tazkiyatun-Nafs (purification of the soul).\nEvery person has many shortcomings, for example, pride, anger, jealousy,\netc. and living with such evils brings grief and agony to a person. Every\neffort should be made to change the evil of pride to humbleness, anger to\nforgiveness, jealousy to submission to the Will of Allah. The most efficient\nway to reform oneself and attain spirituality is to be under the supervision\nof a reliable and qualified spiritual guide (Shaykh). Until you find such a\nperson, we advise you communicate with the pious and learned scholars and\nseek and follow their advice.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
