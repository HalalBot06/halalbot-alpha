  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nContamination and pork\n\nI have three questions to ask\n\n1) I had to go out for work with a few of my collegues and after that we had to go to lunch, i had to go with. While siting around the table the lady sitting next to me decided to eat pork which fell on me. She later saw it and picked it up and then whiped her hands on the table. when i got up and i held my bag in my had not sure if the bag touched the table. I threw the clothes away but not the bag. I left it on the chair for 2 months.\n\nQ: was the chair that i left the bag on contaminated? and what about the contents in the bag?\n\n2) I had to get boxed for my sister at work. The guy that gave them to me was eating bread with polony on (not halaal) and he touched the boxes with the right had while having the bread in his left. When i got there he was already eating. I took the boxes home.\n\nQ: Was the boxes contaminated? and if one touched the boxes and touched other things in the house, Would that have been contaminated as well?\n\n3) I went to a cocktail function with work and not knowing the ppl was eating pork sosaties. I thought it was chicken or fish. One person touched me on my leg and the other on my jacket as well as another touching the chair i was sitting in. I took the jacket off and left it on the passenger side floor. My sister has been travelling with me and leaving her bag on that side of the floor.\n\nQ: Has her bag become contaminated? And has everything else she has touched become contaminated?\n\nA would really appreciate a response since these incidents are making me metally untable. I am continuously washing my hands and it has come to a point of cracking/breaking, dry and getting sores on them as well..\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. There was no need to throw away the clothes. It could have been washed, in which case it would have become clean.\n\nSince you are not sure if the bag came into contact with the pork, the bag is considered clean. The chair will also be considered clean. The contents of the bag will definitely be clean. To clear your doubts, you may wipe the area of the bag you suspect came into contact with the pork with a wet cloth three times. In this way you can be sure it is clean.\n\n2. Only if you are sure that the polony was smeared onto the box to the extent that it is clearly visible on the surface, then that particular area of the box will be impure. We advice that you do not be over-suspicious. Until you are not sure, regard the box as clean.\n\n3. Similarly here, since you did not see any visible impurity, do not be suspicious.\n\nAnd Allah Taâ€™ala knows best.\n\nWas Salaam\n\nMl. E. Vawda\nfor Daarul Iftaa"
