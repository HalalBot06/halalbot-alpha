  "question": "How did Rasulallah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) know which things Jibraeel A.S told him was the Quran?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have read Hadiths and in the answer to How many ways can you read the Quran it says that Rasulallah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) kept asking Jibraeel A.S for more ways so it would be easier for his Ummat and Jibraeel A.S kept asking Allah until Jibraeel A.S Sid Allah has said... So how did Rasuallah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)know that that wasn't part of the Quran since it was from Allah. Jazakallah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe have not come across any reference on the enquired question. Probably,\nJibraaeel (Alayhis salaam) used to inform Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) that the revelation was to be part of the noble Qur'aan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
