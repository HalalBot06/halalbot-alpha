  "question": "I want to wear the purdah - But my concern is due to me working",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI want to wear the purdah - I am currently in hijaab (cloak and scarf). But my concern is due to me working, I will not be able to wear the purdah whilst at my workplace.  Can I wear the purdah during such times that I am leaving my workplace, and after working hours when I am leaving the house?  Unfortunately, nowadays the purdah is being worn as a fashion statement, even to the extent of being used as a disguise.  I have witnessed many women who started wearing the purdah, and after a couple months they left it saying that it's not for them. Insha Allah, please remember me in your duas that I am successful in this quest of mine.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe make du’aa that Allah grant you strength in your intention to wear the Purdah, Aameen.\n\nThe strength in your intention depends on the level of your sincerity. Your motivation should be the pleasure of Allah and to do whatever Allah wants you to do. Remind yourself of this often and this will help you to strengthen your intention.\n\nIf you cannot wear the Purdah at work, you should start wearing the Purdh after the working hours. Your work should not deter you from wearing the Purdah after work.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
