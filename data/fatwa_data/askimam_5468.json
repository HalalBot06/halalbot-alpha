  "question": "Procedures in welcoming a newborn - I am not sure whether it is required that the babies hair to be shaved completely off to the skin or ...",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a revert. My husband is a muslim. I am currently 7 months pregnant with our first child. I have read many articles regarding the Islamic procedures of welcoming a newborn. I am not sure whether it is required that the babies hair to be shaved completely off to the skin or whether it is permissable to remove most of the hair but leaving some behind (i.e. leave a length of about 5mm or so). I have read and heard of adverse medical effects of shaving off a newborns hair completely and that the scalp may develope sores and so on. Obviously I want the best for my newborn as far Islam is concerned and also as far as my babies health is concerned. Please advise whether it is permissable to leave a little of the hair on the head. I have read that the cutting of the babies hair is Mustahab which means it is recommended but not obligatory. Also what are my rights as the babies mother to refuse this one procedure if I feel my baby may gain more harm from it than good, medically speaking?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou state you want the best for your child when he%2Fshe is born. Surely,%0D%0Athere can never be anything better than the guidance and practice of%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0AHe advised the removing of the hair of the new born child. He also practiced%0D%0Aupon that. It is for this reason, the practice is regarded as Mustahabb%0D%0A(desirable) as it has many benefits. The removing of the hair of a new born%0D%0Achild should be done by an experienced person. To the best of our knowledge%0D%0Aand experience, removing the hair does not develop sores.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0AIt order to obtain blessings the following should be done:%0D%0A%0D%0A? The afterbirth (placenta) and navel cord should be buried with due care%0D%0Asince they are parts of the human body.%0D%0A? Upon birth: the newly born child should be given a proper Ghusl.%0D%0A? Thereafter, the first words to reach the child's ears should be the%0D%0Amessage of the Greatness and Oneness of Allah and the Prophethood of%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam). This is done by giving Adhaan near%0D%0Athe right ear and Iqaamat close to the left ear (this noble act should be%0D%0Apreferably be done by an %C1alim or a pious elder of the family). If such a%0D%0Aperson is not immediately available then any Muslim male may conduct this%0D%0ASunnat.%0D%0A? To perform Tahneek (placing of a date, softened by chewing on the tongue%0D%0Aof the new born baby).%0D%0AThe act of Tahneek should also preferably be done by an %C1alim or a pious%0D%0Aelder of the family. If such a person is not available then any Muslim male%0D%0Amay perform this act. Honey may be a substitute for dates, if dates are not%0D%0Aavailable.%0D%0A? To give the new born an appropriate name on the 7th day.%0D%0A? To make Aqeeqa on the 7th day.%0D%0A? Aqeeqa is a form of Sadaqah whereby the child is safeguarded against%0D%0Amisfortunes. Two sheep, alternatively two goats are slaughtered in the case%0D%0Aof a male while one goat or one sheep in the case of a female. If for some%0D%0Areason Aqeeqa was not made on the 7th day, then it should be done on the%0D%0A14th, 21st 28th or any day in multiples of 7 thereafter. The sooner the%0D%0AAqeeqa is performed the better.%0D%0A? It is Mustahabb to remove the baby's hair on the 7th day after birth -%0D%0Agold alternatively silver equivalent to the weight of the removed hair may%0D%0Abe given as charity to the poor otherwise its equivalent value in money. The%0D%0Ahair should be buried with due care and respect.%0D%0A? To prescribe Salaat to the children when they are seven years of age.%0D%0A? To chastise them if they don't perform Salaat when they are 10 years of%0D%0Aage. One is reminded here of the separating of males from that of females%0D%0Awhen the child turns ten years of age.%0D%0A"
