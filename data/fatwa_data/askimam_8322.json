  "answer": "QUESTION\nI received my 1st talaaq and was in my iddat period for 2months when my husband and I broke the iddat period.We did not resolve our differences though therfore he wants to issue me with the 2nd talaaq.For the 1st iddat i was excused from work but that wont be possible for the 2nd iddat.I am living with my parents ,who can support me if need be.Due to the fact that I dont want to burden them financially I dont want to resign from work.Is it wrong for me to go to work even if I go to work wearing my scarf and am dropped off by my father?I work in an office and will be in contact with men but only seldom and only professionally.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for you to go out of the house in which you are spending your ?Iddat.
