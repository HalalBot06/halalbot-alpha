  "question": "Is it permissible for ladies to wear pants and shirts if they maintain their modesty and hijab along with it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have this doubt in mind because it has been said in the Quran that men are not supposed to be dressed like women and vice versa. But now the times are different and taking the simplest example: In pakistan men wear shalwar-kameez also what women wear? (Its a traditional attire) So if women are wearing pants and shirts that are tailored for females, still maintaining the hijab, is it permissible?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for females to wear such clothes (pants and shirts) that\nare specifically tailored for females.\n\nHowever, when a female emerges from her home, she must maintain strict Hijaab.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
