  "question": "I have a Catholic friend. I always use P.B.U.H after the great name of our Prophet Mohammad (P.B.U.H), she asked me why do I do so. Please guide me.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlmighty Allah orders us in the Noble Qur'aan, 'O you who believe! Send blessings and salutations upon the Prophet (Muhammad - May Everlasting peace be upon him). (Ahzaab 56) Allah has also promised us great rewards for sending blessing and salutations to our beloved Prophet (May Everlasting peace be upon him). The unlimited wisdom of this injunction cannot be comprehended by our limited understanding. However, one wisdom is to express our appreciation to our beloved Prophet (May Everlasting peace be upon him) who has made great sacrifices to establish the most correct and beautiful way of life (Islam). It is only due to his sacrifices and endurance of the pain and oppression afflicted on him that we are on the correct path. One tends to emulate a revered person to the extent of the person's love and respect for the revered person. And Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
