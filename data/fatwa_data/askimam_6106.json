  "question": "1. While entering a Masjid in order to move towards the empty rows up front, can one walk in front of people offering Sunnahs?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n2. How about when exiting, and some people choose places in the backside to offer their Sunnahs, and one HAS to cross in front of them to get to the door to go back to their jobs?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou have raised an important issue. A person who intends to perform Sunnah\nSalaat before or after the Fardh Salaat should be considerate to Musallees\nentering the Musjid for Salaat and coming out of the Musjid after Salaat.\nThey should perform their Sunnat Salaats without obstructing any person\ncoming in or coming out of the Musjid. The Imaam may also remind his\ncongregation to be considerate.\n\nIt is not prohibited for a person to walk in line of a person performing\nSalaat and go in front of him. It is prohibited to walk across a performing\nperforming Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
