  "question": "I have two daughters aged 11 and 9. Both are doing Hifaz",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\n I have two daughters aged 11 and 9. Both are doing Hifaz. The elder one has finished about 22 paras (chapters) out of total 30. The younger one has done 12 chapters out of total 30 chapters (Paras or Juzz). We started this about two years ago.  We parents take care of this program at home. As we are living in , so we have to do it at home. Mostly mother takes care of their Hifz.\n\n Until sometime back both were having wish and high moral to complete their work on time and quickly but as the workload is increased they have lost interest in their work at all. We are spending at least 2.5-3 hrs in the morning before Fajir Salaat (no TV at home and they go to bed right after Isha salaat) and about 2.5 hr in the evening. They are going to a govt. Tahfiz-ul-Quran school in ( they are in class 3). They don't have any pressure of school homework. A very few times they have to do home work which they can do in 0.5hr. But the Saudi tahfiz take about 10 years to complete. And they also don't emphasize to complete. So we are not relying on this. We are sending to this school so they can learn Arabic and Arabic accent in reading Quran. (We belong to )\n\n Due to this we (parents) are really upset and under pressure almost everyday and sometime beat them too as they take very long time to read a para and then doing mistakes while reciting by heart. We are getting upset because we think that now we are in a situation of \"NO GO BACK\" and must complete the Hifaz. When we beat them, after word, we feel ashamed our self and think that this is not Farad on them we are doing sin by beating them. Sometime, we spend lot of time try to boost their moral too but it lasts for 1-2 hrs only. We also try to boost their moral by putting prizes or cash money who ever finish their daily work on time. But this too works only for a day or two.\n\n Spending almost 5hrs daily with kids in the situation explained above, our Ikhlaq is zero. Due to this rough tone, we (husband and wife) also argue. Also this situation creates hate (or blaming each other as kids also don't listen to us) between myself and wife. Because if she beats the child I am upset and if I do the same, she fights with me. This situation has destroyed our Ikhlaq. Then we remember the Hadith of Nabi (SAW) that once someone ask about two woman. One with lot of Nafal, Talwat and etc but with Bad Ikhlaq (ÃÎáÇÞ), Nabi (SAW) told that she is Jhanmi. The other lady was just doing Fard Ibadha but with Good Ikhlaq, Nabi (SAW) told that she is Jannati.\n\n In the above situation, let me know of the following questions:\n\n Q.1:  If we stop their Hifaz and the kids forget the paras which they have done until now, what is the result in terms of Aakhira for the parents and kids. Also, keep in mind that they will become adult after some time, what will be their sin for forgetting the Quran in childhood and after being adult?\n\n Q.2: If we stop making effort now and kids forget, would we (parents) will be sinful?\n\n \n\nQ.3: Any of Shabia were Hafiz.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nRasulullah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam advised us not to be hard and severe in matters of Deen. We are advised to be moderate and maintain balance in our approach to Deen. If we adopt a hard approach in Deen, we will keep up to a certain limit and then get frustrated. That will lead us to abandon that virtues and good deeds we are practising on. That is also against Istiqamat and steadfastness. We are able to sustain our practises if we are moderate and balanced in our approach. Rasulullah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam advised the best of actions are those in which there is consistency even though it may be little at a time. We have read your e-mail and observed the progress of your children. They are only 9 and 11 years of age and have completed many juz of the Quran in a relatively short period of time. Mashallah, that is excellent. There is no reason for your’ll to be upset and frustrated. Infact, the children have progressed more than normal children do. It is our advice that 5 hours daily, especially 2/3 hours before Fajr is too taxing. Decrease the time, especially the time before Fajr. The children need their full sleep. If they do not finish sooner, they will finish later. Do not push and exert yourselves and the children to the point of frustration. That is leading your’ll to the point your’ll are in. The children should be taught with love. The Azmat of the Quran should remain in their hearts. The frustrating schedule could decrease the Azmat of the Quran from their hearts. There are great virtues for memorising the Quran for both males and females and the effort should continue at a moderate pace.\n\nThere were Sahabiyyas who were Huffaaz\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n A SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n1. When the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\n2. The guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\n\n3. Education and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\n\n4. Islam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\n\n5. When one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\n\n6. Muslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\n\n7. We have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\n\n8. If you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\n\n9. If that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\n\n10. Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, \"When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit\".\n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
