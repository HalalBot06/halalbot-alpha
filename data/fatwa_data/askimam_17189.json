  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI recently had a misscariage, and according to the fatwa on ask_imam.org, since the the body was not formed (early miscarriage) i considered the bleeding after as haidh, and 10 days later did ghusl.\n\nI carried on bleeding and have regarded this as istihadha. My question is that if after my 15th day (counting from when i did ghusl) i carry on bleeding, should i count it as haidh again? (even though the bleeding is light)\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nYour understanding is correct.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\nWassalam\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
