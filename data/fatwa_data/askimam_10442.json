  "answer": "QUESTION\ni want to a programmer.im not very mathematical but im willing to give it a try What duah can i read so that i choose the right course for a career choice.Inshallah i want to work aboard\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe choice of one?s career is extremely important. It is going to be a choice of your lifelong engagements. It is therefore, important that you make the correct choice.%0D%0A%0D%0ADuring this part of the year, in South Africa, when the academic year has ended, while many students who have completed Matric (grade12) and have chosen their careers, there are many others who are still deciding and%2For are confused. %0D%0A%0D%0AWe thus offer the following guidelines:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. In all important aspects of life, that includes choosing a career, one should ponder very carefully before making a decision. Allah Ta?ala has given everyone intelligence, as well as inclination to a certain field. The personal inclination should also be examined in the light of the intelligence. At all times, one should focus his mind to Allah and seek Allah?s guidance and assistance in choosing an appropriate career. Make the Du?aa ?Allaahumma khir liy wakhtar liy? (O Allah, choose for me and guide me)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Once a person has used his intelligence and after making Du?aa to Allah, if he decided on a certain career, he should discuss that with his seniors and appropriate people. That is Mashwara (consultation). Consider the points presented by all very carefully and without prejudice. Allah Ta?ala states, ?The matters of the believers is with mutual consultation?.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. If you are inclined towards one particular career, enquire the Shar?ee aspect of the career from the Ulama. Remember, your Deen comes first.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. If you are doubtful, do not commit in that state of mind. You may be making a major error in your life. Be careful and cautious.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Make Istikhaara and seek the guidance of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0AInsha Allah, if you follow all the above points, you will be guided by Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
