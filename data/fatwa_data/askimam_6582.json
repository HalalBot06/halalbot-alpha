  "question": "What is the Shar'i ruling on Ilm-ul-Ghaib? Was Nabi(sallallahu alahi wasallam)Aalimul Ghaib as some people claim? Please answer with proofs from the Qur'aan and Sunnah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFrom the outset, we should first understand the meaning of Ilmul Ghayb. It%0D%0Ameans 'knowledge acquired without any means'. Whatever knowledge Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) had, it was given to him by Allah Ta'ala. The%0D%0Aknowledge of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) will not fall under%0D%0Athe category of Ilmul Ghayb.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe quality of Ilmul ghayb is exclusive only to Allah. No prophet, pious%0D%0Asaint or anyone has this quality. To attribute to any person any quality%0D%0Aexclusive to Allah is tantamount to Shirk (ascribing partners).%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Surah Naml Verse 64, Allah Ta'ala says, 'Say, (O Muhammed (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) that nobody in the skies and earth have knowledge of the%0D%0Aunseen (Ghayb) except Allah.%0D%0A2. Allah Ta'ala says, 'Say (O Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)), I do%0D%0Anot have by me the treasures of Allah and I don't know the unseen (Ghayb)%0D%0Aand I am not an angel. I only follow what Wahy (divine revelation) comes to%0D%0Ame. Don't you realize.' (Surah An'aam Aayat49)%0D%0A3. Allah Ta'ala says, 'By Allah is the key of the unseen. None has any%0D%0Aknowledge of it except him.' (Surah An'aam Aayat59)%0D%0A4. Hadhrat Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha) says that person is a liar who says%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) knew what was going to happen tomorrow.'%0D%0A(Bukhari)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
