  "question": "Buying Land for Masjid on Interest (Riba)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan we buy land for masjid on interest? The imam of the local masjid says that according to Fatawa Alamgiri riba is not haram in Dar-ul-Harb and he calls USA as Dar-ul-Harb. Please explain in detail.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the overwhelming majority of the Muslim Jurists, there is no\ndifference in the prohibition of interest between a Muslim and non-Muslim\nanywhere, Darul Islam (Islamic state) or Darul Harb (a state of ongoing\nconflict with Muslims).\n\nIn the early days of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) many Muslims\nused to enter into Riba transactions with non-Muslims, but when Riba was\nprohibited, they stopped this practice totally. The Aayats of the Noble Qur'\nan which prohibited Riba did not differentiate between a Muslim and\nnon-Muslim. Similarly, there is no example in the days of the Sahaaba (RA)\nwhere anyone of the Sahaaba (RA) entered into Riba transaction with a\nnon-Muslim after the prohibition was enforced. Therefore, one cannot be\nadvised to take an interest-bearing loan, even in a non-Muslim country.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
