Every person’s thinking process and mindset is different.\n\nOne should reason with one’s parents on this issue, spelling out to them the pros and cons of the matter. They should be explained the importance of Hayaa and modesty in Islam. A lot of du’aa should be made to Allah to soften their hearts and make them more sensitive to Islamic ethos and values. Insha Allah, Allah will open their hearts to your religious concerns.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
