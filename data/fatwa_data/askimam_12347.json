  "question": "I've heard that not reciting Dua-e-Qunoot is sinful and until the person doesn't learn Dua-e-Qunoot, he will continue to get sin/ Is this true?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI know that if a person does not know Dua-e-Qunoot, then he/she can recite some other du'a from the Qur'an in his/her Witr Salah. But I've heard that not reciting Dua-e-Qunoot is sinful and until the person doesn't learn Dua-e-Qunoot, he will continue to get sin/ Is this true?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn Witr, to recite Du?aa-e-Qunoot is Sunnah. The obligation will be performed with any one du?aa from the Qur?aan or Hadith.\n\nHowever, he will not receive the sawaab of Sunnat. He should try to learn du?aa-e-qunoot.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
