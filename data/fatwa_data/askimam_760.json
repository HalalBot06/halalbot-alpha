  "question": "The FATWA and DALIL regarding the wearing of shoes during performing WUDHU and SALAAT. When and where is it permissible. Can one pray like this at work or university, etc?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDoing MASSAH over the shoes during WUDHU and praying SALAAT wearing the shoes?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible to wear shoes while performing Wudhu. The actual feet must be washed or alternatively Masah may be made on leather socks after having washed the actual feet. In normal circumstances, one cannot perform Salaat with the shoes on as it will be disrespectful to the Musjid and furthermore, wearing shoes alters the correct posture in the sitting position of Salaat.\n\nHowever, due to circumstances, for example, being in a jungle, etc. one will be excused for performing Salaat with the shoes on.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
