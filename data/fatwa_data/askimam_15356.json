  "question": "I get aroused whenever i see or talk to my wife. Do i have to do Ghusl?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have recently got married. I got a problem at the moment. Whenever i look at or talk to my wife (even on the phone). I get aroused, resulting in small drops coming out from the private part. Does this break my Wudu? It happens freguently and i can't stop it. I usually clean it up by rubbing it with a wet hand, Is that suffient? Can you please advise?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe small drops emitting from the private part is known as Mazi. Mazi invalidates the Wudhu and not Ghusal. Mazi is impure. The private parts and the soiled portion of the underground with mazi must be washed.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
