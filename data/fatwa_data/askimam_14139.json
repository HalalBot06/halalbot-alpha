  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. What is the hanafi way of using the index finger during athiyaat. I used to raise it while saying \"il-lallah\" and take the finger and  hand to the normal position (similar to the left hand) till salaam. Is this correct way or there is another more virtous way.\n2. There has been always confusion and argument in our family about using the right or left foot while going and coming out of the house. Also while wearing and removing shoes or socks. What is the sunnah way?\n3. We have a kid 1 and half years old. She sometimes plays(tries to act us like reading) or even throws the islamic books while we are reading. We try to avoid this most. Will there be any kaffara for this.\n4. Also while travelling via air we had carried the Quran in a bag that was sometime treated the way it should not be. Like once or twice I touched with leg unknowingly. Would there be any kaffara for this.\nYour reply is highly appreciated. Thanks in advance. May Allah(swt) reward you. Ameen.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Hanafi way of Tashahhud: The right hand to be kept flat on the thigh just like the left hand. Read Tashahhud, once the Kalimah of Tawheed is reached tuck the baby finger and the ring finger under the palm (fold the baby and ring finger), form a cicle with the thumb and middle finger, raising the index finger at ‘Laa ilaaha …’ and drop the finger at ‘illallaah’. (Shaami vol.1 pg.509)\n\n2. When wearing socks or shoes, the right should be worn first. When removing them, the left should be removed first. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has mentioned, ‘When anyone wears shoes, begin with the right and when removing begin with the left foot so the right would be the first to wear a shoe and be the last to have its shoe removed.’\n\n3. The child has no understanding of right and wrong, good and evil. At such a tender age, the child is not accountable for her actions. However, the adults are responsible, not to leave the Islamic books where the child can get hold of them.\n\n4. The Qur’aan is the book of Allah. One must hold utmost respect for the holy Qur’aan. If a person abuses the Qur’aan intentionally, then he is sinful and the act is wrong. When travelling with a Qur’aan, utmost care must be taken to observe the sanctity of the Qur’aan giving it the respect it deserves. If after observing this, the bag in which the Qur’aan is mishandled unintentionally, there will be no Kaffaarah for this.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
