  "question": "Duas to help someone revert to Islam? is our Salaat valid with braids in?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nare there any duas I can recite to help my friend see the truth of Islam? Also, I know it's permissable for guys to have braids, but is our Salaat valid with braids in? Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There is no specific Masnoon Du?aa for this situation, however you should perform two Rak?aats Salaatul Haajat and ask Allah Ta?ala to guide your friend towards Islam. May Allah Ta?ala open up to him the truth and beauty of Islam and you should also ask your friend to make Du?aa and ask the Creator to guide him to the true religion.\n\n2. It is Makrooh (undesirable) for men to have braids. Therefore if a man performs Salaat with braided hair, his Salaat will be Makrooh.
