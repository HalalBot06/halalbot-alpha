  "question": "Is the tuition money halal? The money they give me is not money I need to spend for my tuition expenses.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1.) You previously stated that fruits covered by a glaze that may be derived from animal ingredients is haram. What if you just peel the skin of fruit (i.e. in an apple, banana, orange, watermelon, etc.); will that make the fruit halal? I need to know; I have stopped eating fruits because of this information. 2.) I receive money from my university each semester; my university has defined this money as for me to spend as I wish (it is dubbed a refund I receive after the school pays all of my tuition expenses). The money they give me is not money I need to spend for my tuition expenses. Is this money halal? Should I give some of it to charity?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Kindly elaborate on what you mean by animal ingredient and where did we refer to that query?\n\n2. If the university offers you money for personal expenses, you may accept it and spend as you wish, including giving in charity if it is within your means.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
