  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen I am washing my arms in Wudhu I first wash my left arm with my right hand ONCE, then do the same for the left arm, I then cup some water in my right hand and pour it over my arm THREE times and then do the same for the left arm. I was wondering if this is a permissible method for washing the arms, if not what is the preferred method?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn Wudhu, the hands must be washed only till the elbows (elbows included).\n\nThe arms do not have to be necessarily washed in Wudhu.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
