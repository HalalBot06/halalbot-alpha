  "question": "If you go against istikharah namaaz what is the consequence?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMoulana Badre Alam Mirathi (RA) writes in his footnotes of the popular commentary of Bukhari, Faydhul Baari by Allaamah Anwar Shah Kashmiri (RA) regarding the reality of Istikhaara. He states, ?? in other words, it is sometimes misunderstood from the statements of the Ulama that it is promised in the Hadith of Istikhaara that the heart of a person who performs Istikhaara will incline towards one option, whereas many a time the person who performs Istikhaara does not perceive such an inclination.%0D%0A%0D%0AHe says the Hadith of Istikhaara does not contain anything pertaining to the inclination or satisfaction of the heart. Had it been such Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) would have taught us, in the Du?aa to ask Allah to incline the hearts towards the most appropriate decision, whereas the Hadith does not say that. The Du?aa only contains this much that, Allah Ta?ala should protect him from harm and should determine a good fate for him, whatever it may be. And the words of the Du?aa, ?And turn me away from it,? means that when the heart is desirous to go ahead with the matter regarding which Istikhaara is being made, then may Allah Ta?ala turn the heart away from it by removing this desire and inclination from the heart. Our responsibility is to make Du?aa and make Mashwara (consultation) and then proceed in the direction of one?s choice as that will be best for him. This means that he will be granted the Tawfiq (ability of the best only and only the best will be made and easy for his). Thus, Istikhaara is an act that helps to determine the best for a person. In essence, Istikhaara is a Du?aa seeking the assistance of Allah. After that, whatever direction a person takes will be for his betterment even though his heart may be disinclined to it.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
