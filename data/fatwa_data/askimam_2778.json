  "question": "Spinal cord in chicken neck haraam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have heard that the part of the spinal cord in the the neck of the chicken is haraam. Is this true and, if so, does that mean anything cooked along with the neck of the chicken without this removed is also haraam?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nConsumption of the spinal cord itself is undesirable. (Fataawa Darul Uloom\nvol.1 pg.970; Darul Ishaat)\n\nIt is, therefore, better to remove it before cooking it if this can be done\neasily, the food prepared without its removal is Halaal (permissible).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
