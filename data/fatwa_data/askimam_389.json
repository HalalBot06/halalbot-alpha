  "question": "Some Muslims I know read the Bible and try to find guidance in it. Is such behavior permissible? Please explain?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) replied to a similar question by\nsome of his Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum), 'Do you doubt (in your religion)\njust as the Christians and Jews doubted in their religion (during the time\nof their Prophets).'\n\nHe further mentioned, 'Even if Musa (Alayhis salaam) was alive today, he\nwould have followed me.' If Musa (Alayhis salaam) would not seek guidance\nfrom the Tawraat (old testament) and Eesa (Alayhis salaam) will follow the\nQur'aan upon his arrival on earth, how then can one we follow the scriptures\nof Musa and Eesa (Alayhis salaam). They themselves regard the Qur'aan and\nAhaadith as their superguide despite being the direct recipients of\nrevelation of the Tawraat and Injeel. It is not permissible for Muslims to\nseek any guidance from non-Muslim sources. The Qur'aan and Ahaadith is their\nonly and best source of guidance.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
