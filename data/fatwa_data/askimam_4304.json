  "question": "Assalaamu Alaykum Respected Mufti Saheb, shahru mubarak. I have a question about how to start salat.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)how and what do you say before salat if praying alone(adhan)? 2)what about if your praying in group out side masjid? Jazakallah Khair. may Allah reward you for your good work.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBefore commencing salaah, one does not have to say anything. The intention\nfrom the heart to perform a specific salaah, Fajar, Zohar etc. is\nsufficient. The ruling is the same in performing individually or in\ncongregation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
