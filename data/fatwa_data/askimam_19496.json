  "question": "Is it permissible to perform wudhu in a washroom? Would it permissible to perform wudhu in a washbasin? Can I wash my feet in the toilet?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease give me a response to the following questions:\n\n1.      The washroom in my office consists of toilets, urinals, wash basins and also there is a separate place to perform wudhu.  I would like to know if it is permissible to perform wudhu in such a washroom.  There could be some bad odour at times in the washroom.\n\n2.      Can wudhu be performed by wearing shoes on a wash basin in a standing position?  I shall remove my shoes whilst washing my feet.\n\n3.      In some washrooms, there are wash basins and toilets only.  Can wudhu be performed on the wash basin except the feet?  Can I wash the feet in the toilet as I cannot reach the wash basin?  \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nIn principle, it is permissible to do wudhu standing and sitting.  It will have no impact on the validity of wudhu.  However, it would be better to sit and perform wudhu whenever possible.  If it is difficult to sit and perform wudhu, then there will be no objection in standing and performing wudhu.[i]\n\nAs long as your feet including your ankles are washed during wudhu, it will be permissible to do wudhu in a wash basin.[ii]  However, one must make sure he keeps the floor clean and dry.  It has sadly been witnessed in many public washrooms that Muslims leave the floor wet due to washing their feet.  We should be conscious at all times of not causing inconvenience to others.  Treat others like the way you would like to be treated.\n\nIt is undesirable to perform wudhu or a part of wudhu in a place of impurity.  However, if there is no option but to wash your feet in the toilet, it will be permissible for you to do so.  Be very cautious of coming into contact with impurities.
