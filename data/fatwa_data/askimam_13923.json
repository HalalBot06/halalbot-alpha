  "question": "The love for my dear Prophet Muhammed (peace be upon him)is decreasing",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThe love for my dear Prophet Muhammed (peace be upon him)is decreasing .. Sometimes my innerself says bad things and thoughts about him...I really dont know why this is happening...what is happening..Am I cursed ??\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe fact that you are in pain because of the bad thoughts you have is proof enough of your love for Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. Had you not had love for Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], you would not have such pain. Nevertheless, you should ignore the thoughts as they are involuntary and beyond your control. They are whispers of the Shaytaan. Do not entertain such evil thoughts as they will then find its roots deep in your heart. That is what Shaytaan desires. Ignore such thoughts and simply recite, ‘Laa hawla walaa quwwata illaa billaah’.\n\nYou should obtain some reliable literature about the Seerah and character of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and read that as much as possible. That information will fill that vacuum which is occupied by evil thoughts. It is advisable to read Ahaadith and incidents about the miracles (Mu’jizaat) performed by Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. Ponder upon scientific developments and after so much of research, some people can only go to the moon and that too for a few days with so much of fear and apprehension. 1400 years ago, Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] surpassed all of that and went right to Allah above the seven heavens within a short period of the night. There is so much more. Ponder upon his beautiful face, beautiful smiling eyes, beautiful beard, beautiful walk, beautiful character and ponder the day we will meet him and he will present us with the water of Hawse-Kawthar on the plains of Hashr when the sun will be just above us and we will be extremely thirsty. That is the extent of his love for us. Ponder when he will bow down by the Arsh of Allah and beg Allah to forgive us and he will save us from Hell. How loving is our Nabi Muhammad [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]? Why did he wake up in the middle of the night and cry ‘Yaa Ummati’ (O my Ummah, O my Ummah).\n\nHe had the choice to live like a king, why he chose to live like a slave?\n\n1. Why did his feet swell up due to excessive worship?\n\n2. Why should he allow himself to be hit and tortured in Taaif with his Mubaarak blood flowing from his body?\n\n3. Why should his family suffer just because he called the people to the Oneness of Allah?\n\n4. Why should his daughters marriages break because he propagated the Oneness of Allah?\n\nThe honesty and sincerity of our beloved Rasul [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] was witnessed by His Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhu] who were prepared to give their lives for him. Ah! How fortunate are the Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhu]. No joy can overcome such joy of witnessing the Habib of Allah. Ah! Could I get that beautiful vision in this world? Oh Allah, aameen.\n\nSo great is my Habib, that Allah and His angels send Durood and salawaat upon him. There are 70,000 angels at every time by his Rawza who send Durood and Salaam upon him. Angels are appointed all around the world to carry a single durood to him. How fortunate we are to have our Durood carried by an angel and presented with our name to our beloved Habi. That brings much joy to him.\n\nOh Allah, send special Duroods and salawaat to Habib [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] from Ebrahim ibn Yusuf Desai and make Habib [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] happy on behalf of the Ummah especially at this time, Aameen Yaa Rabbal Aalameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
