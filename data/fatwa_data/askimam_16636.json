There are many harms caused be having pre-martial relations which is apparent in our society. If you truly intend marrying this person, then the parents of both parties should be contacted and the matter should be discussed with the parents. Inshallah, by adopting the Islamic method of marriage, both of you will be saved from the sin of pre-martial relationship and Allah will put blessings in your marriage. May Allah give us to ability to practice upon the teachings of Shari’a, Ameen.\n\n \n\nIslam has given a woman the liberty to keep her maiden name or adopt her husband’s surname. Islamic does not compel her to change her name if she does not wish to. However, due to external reason as mentioned in the web link provided by you, it might be advisable for the woman to change her surname in order to avoid inconveniences in the future. She may also opt to change the surname only for legal documents and use her maiden name in normal daily life.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
