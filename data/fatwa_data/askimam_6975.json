Absolutely there is nothing to be despondent of Allah our creator, Nourisher Sustainer is all-knowing and watching. Therefore, continue supplicating supplicating to Allah asking him your needs.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. You may recite this Du?aa, ?Allahumma ikfiniy bihalaalika an haraamika wa aghniniy bi fadhlika amman siwaaka.?%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Yes.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Q: Is it permissible to use a perfume, deodorant, etc. which contains alcohol, and if so, can one perform Salaat without washing it off?%0D%0AA: It is not permissible to use deodorants that contain alcohol from grapes or date extracts. Such perfumes are impure and Salaat with it is invalid. However, if the alcohol is synthetic, it is pure and permissible to use. Salaat without washing off such perfumes will be valid. Sometimes, it becomes difficult to differentiate between genuine and synthetic alcohol. Thus, to be on the safe side, one should rather prefer using deodorants and perfumes that are labelled as ?alcohol-free?, especially when such perfumes are easily available. (Mufti M Saeed Motara; Azaadville)%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Yes, Salaam and Durood is meritorious. One should endervour daily to send Durood on our beloved Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). you may seclude yourself and with devotion recite the Durood upon Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). The book, Forty Duroods, compiled by Sheikh Zakariyyah (RA) is very beneficial and effective.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. There is no benefit in wearing such gems. In fact, men should avoid wearing such ornaments of beauty.%0D%0A%0D%0A7. There are no special benefit or time for using Loshaan and Agharbatti. It is generally used for it scent.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
