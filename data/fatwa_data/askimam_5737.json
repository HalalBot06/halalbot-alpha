  "question": "Is it permissible to share an apartment with a person who is earning money which is haram e.g working in a liquor store",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nQ1)I have leased an apartment and now I am sharing it with other muslim brother , if the person's source of income is haram (working for a liquor store) than will it be halal to share the apartment with him ,since I am also benefiting from his income. Q2)I rented out a room to a muslim brother from the apartment which I have on the lease ,while giving the room for rent , I forgot to tell him that he has to give me a one month notice (or give one month rent ) before leaving the room as I have to do the same while leaving the apartment ,however the person was aware of this fact . Now he has left the room with a 12 hours notice which has caused me hardship as I was unable to look for another person to rent out the room . Is this person liable to give me a one month rent according to shariah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is permissible for you to share the apartment with him intending to\ntake benefit from your halal share of the contribution and not his haram\nshare.\n\n2. If you had not signed a lease with the brother and the room was rented\nout on a month to month basis then you are not entitled to claim one month's\nrent as the brother had vacated the premises before the start of the new\nmonth. (Hashiya ibn Abidin v6 p334 Dar al-Fikr 1995)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
