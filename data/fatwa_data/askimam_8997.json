  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have a job offer to work in an advertising company. The company however does advertising for international music groups. The position offered to me is not involved in any way with the promoting of these singers but rather in IT. I would be assisting the company users with their computer related queries. I am hesitant to take the job but believe that careerwise it would be beneficial . Your advise would be greatly appreciated .\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMusic is prohibited. Your employment in the IT department of the advertising company will require you to assist their music advertising clients in their computer related queries. That will also be promoting the music industry.\n\nAllah Ta?ala says, ?And do not assist in sin.? (Maaidah). It is not permissible for you to accept employment in the IT department of advertising company.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
