  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) I once was writing a metaphor  of divorce without any intention. After a moment due to confusion I thought there was intention when I wrote it, but after some thinking I realised there wasn't. So I think I verbally said to myself ' there was no intention at the time of writing the metaphor but the intention came after a short while of writing this word'. And then after some more thinking I then said to myself  ' there was no intention at all''. Could you tell me if this would count if I did say this? Also I would like to know If there was no intention at the time of writing the metaphor, but the intention came after a short while, would that count? Please note that there was no intention when the metaphor was written.\n\n \n2) Also I would like to know, if a person WRITES e-mail to find out the ruling and on the e-mail its written that they said or wrote a metaphor with intention, but in reality they didn't say it or write it with intention or the metaphor was never spoken, would that count just because they wrote in the email that they said it or wrote it with intention, when really there was no intention at the time of saying or writing ?\nIf I have confused you please ask me.\n \nANSWER\n\n\nShare:"
