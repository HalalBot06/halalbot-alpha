  "question": "How does one repent from the sin of cheating in exams, tests, homeworks, etc?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow does an individual go about doing tawbah for cheating in one's studies? If the student is now in university, and wants to do tawbah for cheating in his school days, then how does he do tawbah? If he has cheated somewhat in his university as well, does he go and tell the professor that he cheated? Doing this could cost him more than simply losing the marks he got through cheating. The professor could report him to the chancellor, and he could be made an example of. Though the likelihood of this is less, it is very possible. Does he lose an equal amount of marks in his future exams, to compensate for what he got unfairly in his previous exams? Or does he simply ask Allah for forgiveness, and never repeat the sin ever again? Will he ever be forgiven by Allah? Plz help, and give proper advice and guidance, Insha'Allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHe should feel remorse over his act, stop doing it and make a firm determination never to do it again. He should seek forgiveness from Allah in abundance and ask Allah to reward all those who might have been harmed or deceived by his cheating.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
