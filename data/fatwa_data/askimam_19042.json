  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMuhtaram Mufti Saheb\n\nWho is Waris Ali Shah. Someone told me he is a wali (saint). Please let me know so I can make arrangements to visit his qabr on my trip to India.\nIf a muslim friend has committed a crime (murder or fraud), should I (his friend) report him to the police?\n\nJazakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\n1) Hadhrat Hāji Wāris ῾Ali Shāh rahimahullāh was a great Saint of Silsilah Chistiyyah (Chain of Chishti Saints). His mazār is situated in Dewā Sharif, District Barabanki (India).1\n\nIn principle it is permissible to visit the mazārs of our pious predecessor 2 with correct beliefs and etiquettes, however, it is better to avoid visiting places where Bid῾aat (innovations) and Rusumāt (customs) are the order of the day, such as “Dewā Mela” “Dewā Fair” “Chādar Prensentation” “Non stop Qawāli” are the Highlights of Dewā Sharif Mazar’s.\n\n2) Concerning the Murder and Fraud, kindly write to us in detail in order for us to determine the correct shar῾i ruling.\n\n \n\n(Chishti Darwaish, Pg.51, Aljamiat Book Depot)1\n\n(Jāmi῾ul Fatāwa, Vol.2, Pg.575, Rabbani Book Depot)2\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl.
