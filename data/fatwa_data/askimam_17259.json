  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni want to know that whether anyone else like my mother or father would be punished because of my sins.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf you are an adult (baaligh) and you committed sins by yourself without your parents having played any part of you committing the sins, then you will be solely responsible for your sins. You parents will not be responsible for such sins committed by yourself.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalam\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
