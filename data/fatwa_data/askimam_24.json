  "question": "If someone takes a shower and has the intention to pray, is this valid wudu? Or must he make wudu before he prays?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Mustahabb to make Wudhu before bathing. However, if one did not make\nWudhu before bathing, since the limbs of Wudhu will be washed during\nbathing, the Wudhu will be valid. Wudhu does not have to repeated before\nperforming Salaat.\n\nBy Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
