  "question": "Should i keep contact with a namehram that i really like but i don't want to go against shariah and i don't want to go against my parents' wishes what should i do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI really like this person that i know from internet chats, I've never seen him he has never seen me but yet the way he thinks and the way he handles issues makes me very attracted to him. We both feel the same way but when the thought of marriage comes he still needs to build himself with a career and education but i don't know what to do about this. As u know he's not mehram to me so every chat i have with him is (if i'm correct) considered zina of all my body parts? is that right? And then next comes the thought of telling our parents, with this i don't want to. First fo all i don't have that relationship with my parents where i can tell them i like this person because i've always been kept away from guys and even if i did tell them that i liked him i don't want them to approve of the marriage if they aren't happy. I don't want to take the right of my parent to pick out the right husband for me. My parents have to worry about my brothers and what will happen with their future but they never had to worry about me and i don't want them to start having to worry about me. I've always been taught that happiness is within the happiness of your parents. Janaat lies in ur mother's feet and ur father is the middle of the two doors in jannat, i want to reach those doors in jaanat with the rest of the ummah InshALlah. So i need to know what i should do should i keep contact with him? JazakAllah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMasha-Allah it appears that the Khauf of Allah Ta'ala is in your heart. You probably have been brought up in a good environment that brings a sense of uneasiness in committing wrong. Most certainly you have become another victim caught in the satans nets and web over the internet and web sites.%0D%0A%0D%0AFurthermore, your pristine innocence is being mocked and violated by this chatline guy - (namehram). He seems to be a smooth and swift chatline talker and knows how to tug at the heart.. However reading further, he seems to prey on women using them or could be just you - because when you talk about commitment , he drops with his line of career and education. If someone is in love or attracted then he will move mountains to reach you and please you.%0D%0A%0D%0ATo ask to this, you are quiet right as you bring about the Displeasure of Allah Ta'ala and hence misery and leading towards destruction of yourself. You will have to make a firm decision-close chapters- if he wants you, he must come forth the correct way, no haraam communication. If you both want to marry, good (do so immediately) if not, end off.%0D%0A%0D%0ADon't ruin your reputation and future. Make sincere tauba. Ask Allah Ta'ala to guide you and make a firm intention not to get caught in the trap again.%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala guide you and brighten your future for you.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A2SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AChecked & approved: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
