  "question": "i am a 19yr girl.But when i was 15,i masturbated and bleed abit. I repented, inshallah it will be accepted. How can i cover up my mistake to my future husband or is it haram if i re-stitch my hymen?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is encouraging to note that you have changed your line of thinking and action (i.e. masturbation) and make tuba. Alhumdulliah. At the present moment, it is important to come to terms once and for all - that what has happened, has happened. This is of utmost importance. Again once and for all, repent in such a manner of regretting upon it, making a firm intention never to repeat it again and seek forgiveness from Allah Ta'ala and carry on with life. Don't look back. Note coming to terms is important.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs far as re-stitching the hymen depends on the extent of the damage done. A slight tear may be re-stitched - this would have to be checked preferably by a Muslim female doctor.. However you mention you bled-could it be that something was inserted in the vagina which could have ruptured the membrane causing bleeding? If the hymen is broken to an extent that there is nothing there to stitch then re-stitching is futile.%0D%0A%0D%0ACoping Skills%0D%0ANevertheless it also common knowledge that the hymen may tear because of other factors like horse riding, gymnastics etc, hence not everybody bleeds%0D%0Awhen virginity is broken. Hence an option may be to forget about the cause of the tear and rather focus on building a good positive relationship with%0D%0Ayour husband and being an honourable good wife for the Pleasure of Allah Ta'ala.%0D%0A%0D%0AShould you be questioned on your hymen by your husband- At that stage you may query how to handle the situation then. If not carry on with life%0D%0Afocussing on changing your life for the pleasure of Allah Ta'ala and seek from Allah Ta'ala.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"May Allah Ta'ala grant us honour cover our faults and protect us from disgrace in this world and the Aakhira.\"%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A2Social Department%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
