  "question": "Here in Saudi Arabia the Ulema (including Maulana Khair Mohammad Hijazi Makki) say that Allah is not everywhere physically but on Arsh only. He can be said everywhere by knowledge and vision?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThese are some problems being faced in Saudi Arabia, Please guide, Jazakallah Khair\n\n1. Aqeeda:  Where is ALLAH?\n\n Here in Saudi Arabia the Ulema (including Maulana Khair Mohammad Hijazi Makki) say that Allah is not everywhere physically but on Arsh only. He can be said everywhere by knowledge and vision? Is it correct to have the same aqeedah?\n\n 2. For Namaz.\n\n On Friday, Juma  Khutba starts here I Saudi arabia usually on or before the time of Dhuhar (hanafi). Is it allowable to perform four rakat Sunnah before that time. If not allowed, then what to do? \n\nWhen Imam at the end of Juma Khutba ask Dua, can we say Aameen or not? If yes, by raising our hands or not? Can we reply the Azan of Khutab as we reply for other Azan?\n\nWhen the time of 'Zawal' starts and ends according to hanaf. For how long the zawala time stays. Is it allowable to perform nafal namaz, Sajda tilawat, Qaza-e-umri during that time.\n\nIf we could not pray 4 rakat of sunnah before fardh of Dhuhar then should it be performed after fardh or not? Does the importance and fadhilat remain the same?\n\nf we could not perform asar salah with Jamat then is it allowable to perform our own namaz prior to starting time of Asar Hanafi (double size of shade) but after azan here in .\n\nWhat to do if the Imam of masjid make masah on his nylone socks during making wudhu?\n\n \n\n3. Zabeeha (Slaughtering)\n\n Is it allowable to eat the frozen or fresh chicken slaughtered in but available in the market with skin. (as you know that, after slaughtering, the chicken is kept in hot or boiling water to remove the wings, then only its 'ghilazat' is removed.)\n\nIs it allowable to eat meat in , when it is imported from western counteries like , when we have some doubt that they do not slaughter in Islamic way, although there is a system of certification by an appropriate authority appointed by the Government of Saudi Arabia. (Please keep in mind that the Saudis are having opinion that the slaughtering by \"Ahle-e-kitab' is allowable in Islam.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Allah Ta’ala is pure and free from all similarities to human beings. By confining Allah to a specific place, like the Arsh, a form is automatically being attributed to Allah. Once a form/shape is attributed to Allah, a deficiency is being attributed to Allah Ta’ala. Since, time and place are both created things. Allah was how He was and still is the same. He is not affected by the passing of time. It is, therefore, improper to say Allah is on the Arsh. Similarly, it is improper to say Allah is everywhere. The best and safest option is the stance adopted by our Salaf (pious predecessors), i.e. to believe in Allah as He is without delving into the details on these issues. (Al-Iemaanu billaah).\n\n2. It is not permissible for Hanafis to perform the 4 Sunnats before Zawaal. An alternative will be to perform the Sunnats after the Jumu’ah Salaat. (Fath Baabil Inaaya vol.1 pg.179; Dar al-Arqam; Beirut)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
