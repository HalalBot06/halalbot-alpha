I live in dubai and would like to know if 'Dubai Islamic Bank' is reliable for islamic finance\n\n3. i have heard of islamic investment bonds.. pls go through this site.. www.nationalbonds.ae  it is an investment opportunity claiming to work under shariah. pls confirm if it is permissible and how it works.. they are offering huge prizes every month for bond holders.. so i am afraid that it might be haram.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1. It is permissible to lend money to non-muslims, on condition one does not know that the money will be directly used for a clear wrong according to shariah.  In that case, the loan will fall in the category of assisting in sin which prohibited. (Fatawa Mahmudiya 546/19 Jamia Farukiya)\n\n2.When taking a loan from a bank which is shariah compliant to purchase a particular commodity, the bank buys the commodity from the original seller, adds an appropriate profit, then sells it onwards to the customer and retains its total price in instalments. (Contemporary Fatawa 291 Idara-e-Islamiat)\n\nWith regards to Dubai Islamic Bank and islamic investment opportunities mentioned on the site www.nationalbonds.ae, we are unable to pass a ruling without knowing the exact contents of their contracts.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMl.
