  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n I wanted to know if a woman can reomove  unwanted hairs of the part of the body that should not be there. I am very shameful to ask this question but i do not know whom ask other than mufti. The question goes something like this: unwanted hairs between chest (very few but big, more than one balish) i never taken in out but it grew itself, also here around nipple on the breast (very very few). I do not want to do sin, plz i am very confused and cannot ask anyone because it is too private, let me know should i remove or leave. Is it something abnormal\n\nAlso if there is visit to doctor can i remove it\n\nonce again iam sorry to ask this question and full with shame\n\nJazakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nRespected Sister in Islam\n\n \n\n \n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\n \n\n \n\nIt is permissible for a woman to remove the hair on her chest and around her nipples.
