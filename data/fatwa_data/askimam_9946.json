  "question": "what can my husband do if he cannot perform normal wudhu or tayyammum. he has severe eczema and was recently hospitalised.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy husband has severe eczema and was recently hospitalised. Now that he has been released from hospital he has to apply ointment once a day. The problem is he cannot perform wudhu as the ointment is to keep his skin lubricated otherwise he begins to itch and scrathch which worsens his condition. We have thought about performing tayyammum but we question it. Because tayyamum is dusty and if he has any dust on him it ignites the itching. Maybe one day, Insha Allah, he wont need such drastic measures for his skin. But for now we need a solution becoz he doesnt make salaat and feels like he is living in sin. This troubles him that he cannot perform salaat and it weighs on my mind too. Can he make wudhu over his ointment or is this wudhu invalid? Is there any other way??? my husband and i appreciate your efforts.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not necessary to perform Tayammum on a dusty object. It is sufficient that the object is from earthly substance even if there is no dust on it. If one performs Tayammum on a clean brick, not having any dust, it will suffice.\n\nIf one cannot make Tayammum due to medical reasons, Salaat may be performed without Tayammum as well. The Salat will be valid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
