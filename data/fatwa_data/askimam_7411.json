  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has prohibited us from cutting and mutilating the human body. Nevertheless, the object of Dhikr is not to get into such a condition where you begin to do unnatural things, but it is a means of gaining proximity of Allah Ta?ala and earning his mercy.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
