  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamualaikum\n\nI am Internal Auditor. My job involves doing mainly compliance based testing. Compliance of companies policies and procedures as well as legislative requirements. Based on the findings we would issue management with recommendations to improve the situation which they may or amy not accept. Recommendations normally are best practise related. We report to the audit committee functionally and normally the Finance executive administratively. In essence we are have to be independen in order for us to be objective. tWe do no processing of transaction or monitoring. We used a risk based approach in deciding what to audit. The reason I mention all this is for you to have an understanding of the profession in general. I am in the process of applying for another job. I want to know what industries should I not consider. At the moment the best alternatives based on my work experience are the banks. can I apply here? Are there any areas that I should avoid altogether?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nThere are three angles to your query.\n\n·        As an auditor\n\n·        Recommendations on policies, procedures and legislation requirements in a conventional bank.\n\n·        Remuneration from a conventional bank.\n\nIn general, an auditor inspects recordings of a transaction according to set policies. In principle, there is nothing wrong with the practice of auditing. An auditor is not part of the recorded un-Islamic dealings. However, viewing the situation within the context of a conventional bank and the description of your job, it is obvious that the core practice of a conventional bank is interest related and other non-Shariah Compliant transactions. You will be required to inspect and analyse the policies and procedures of such transactions and make recommendations to improve everything related to that. Such a practice clearly falls within the prohibition of assisting in sins.\n\nAllah Ta’ala says,\nوَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ…\nAnd do not assist in sin and oppression…\n(Al Qur’ān 5:2)\n\nFind attached a chart outlining the different categories of assisting in sins.\n\nThe third angle is the remuneration from the Bank. Generally the major source of a conventional bank is from interest and other non-Shariah Compliant transactions. Apart from the un-Islamic practice as an internal auditor with the job description explained by you, your remuneration from such a source will also be unlawful, thus compounding the reason of prohibition in working in a conventional bank.\n\n \nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n \nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
