  "question": "Is wrestling haram? why?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nis wrestling haram to play for school. thank you\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) A person by the name of Rukhana came to Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) and said, 'I am the strongest of the Arabs, if you could overpower%0D%0Ame, I'll accept your faith.' Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) agreed, when%0D%0Athey wrestled, he was overpowered by Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0A%0D%0A2) Whenever an army of Mujahidin moved out from Madinah, Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) first inspected them to ensure that nothing%0D%0Awas lacking in men and equipment. If anyone was underage, he would send them%0D%0Aback to Madinah. While setting out for Uhud, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) carried out this inspection. He ordered the young boys to go back.%0D%0AAmong them were 'Abdullah bin Umar, Zaid-bin-Thabit, Usamah-bin-Zaid,%0D%0AZaid-bin-Arqam, Baraa-bin-Aazib, 'Amr%ADbin-Hazam, Usaid-bin-Zuhair,%0D%0A'Urabah-bin-Aus, Abu Said Khudri, Sumurah-bin-Jundub and Raf'e-bin- Khadij.%0D%0AAll of them had just entered their teens. Khadij said to the Prophet%0D%0A((Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), 'O Prophet of Allah! My son Rafe'e is a very%0D%0Agood archer.' Rafe'e too stood on his toes to show himself taller than he%0D%0Aactual was. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) permitted him to stay%0D%0Aon. When Samrah bin Jundub learnt about this, he complained to his%0D%0Astep-father Murrah bin Sanaan saying, 'Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) has permitted Raf'ee and rejected me, while I am sure to beat him%0D%0Ain a wrestling contest and, therefore, I was more deserving of the Prophet's%0D%0Afavour.' This was reported to Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), who%0D%0Aallowed Samrah to prove his claim by wrestling with Rafe. Samrah did%0D%0Aactually beat Rafe in the bout and he too was permitted to stay in the army.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn view of the above two incidents, it is clear that wrestling itself is a%0D%0Apermissible (Mubaah) skill that obtained Deeni benefits. In principle, one%0D%0Amay follow a Mubaah act on condition it is not contaminated with anything%0D%0Aun-Islamic. Some of the un-Islamic factors which may render wrestling%0D%0Aprohibited are: a) Being commercialized venture, hence, un-Islamic factors,%0D%0Aintermingling of sexes, exposure of Satar, etc. b) Being unmindful of%0D%0ASalaat.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
