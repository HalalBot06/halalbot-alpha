  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Assalamu Alaikum Warahmathullah Can you advise from which age will be considered as a Baligh? I have missed lot of prayers in until my age 19. between 15 Year and 19 Years of age I have lost many prayers except Juma How can I complete this lost prayers. Can I pay some foodstuff to the poor people instead of the lost prayers. If I can how much quantity I have to pay? Also My Fajr Prayers are getting Qada every day. I have great wish to pray it as ADA?a and fix alarm but usually I stop and sleep again. If I wake up for prayer I cannot sleep again. Can you advise me how long a man can sleep per day. I usually go to bed between 11: 00 -12:00 and now the Fajr time is about 4:10 am.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou would be considered Baaligh from the time you experienced a wet-dream. If you didn't experience it, then from the time you turned fifteen years of age according to the lunar calender. It will be necessary for you to calculate the number of salah you missed during this time and it will be Fard for you to make Qadha of them. There is no other way. It is not as difficult as it seems. An simple, tried and tested method is that after every Fard salah a person makes Qadha of the first salah of that type on this head eg. After Zuhr, you make Qadha of the first Zuhr on your head, after Asr, Qadha of Asr etc. It will only be necessary to make Qadha of the Fard not the sunnats.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt seems that you are having a problem awakening for fajr because of going to sleep too late. Sleep an hour or two earlier, it will be easier to wake up for Fajr. Our advice to you is to daily read a few ahadith of Nabi (Sallalahu Alaihi wasallam) on the importance of salah and on the warnings for missing salah. These can be found in Fazail e Amal, Riyadus Saaliheen etc.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
