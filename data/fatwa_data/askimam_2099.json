  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaikum Mufti Sahib. In a case where there might be a disagreement between two mufti's, for example yourself and perhaps a local muft. Is locality a factor in choosing which opinion one should follow, for example ? Jazakallah Khairoun for your time and may Allah reward you for your good work.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Fatwa of the local Mufti will be preferred if the ruling is based on the\nUrf (local customs) of that area, if all the conditions of issuing a decree\non Urf are fulfilled.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
