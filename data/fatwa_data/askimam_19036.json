  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nOn my marriage last year (July 2009)my parents gave me 450 gm of gold. My husband has a debt of around 5 lakhs (Indian Rupees) he had taken for his house pending, I would like to know how to calculate Zakaat, Should i calculate on the 450 grams of gold I possess, or should i reduce the debt my husband owns for the house and then calculate zakaat. We do not have any other savings.\n\nRequest you to clarify my doubt on this.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nYou should pay zakat on 450 gm of Gold which is in your possession. You cannot deduct your husband’s debt from your gold. Everyone is liable to pay his own zakat.\n\n(Aap kay Masail, Vol. 3, Pg.346, Maktabah Bayyinaat)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl. Abdur Rahman Shareef,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
