And I Want To Marry Her So Tell Me The Solution That What Should We do??thnx\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for writing to the institute.You say that you have a girlfriend. Having a girlfriend is not acceptable in Islam. Please approach your parents as soon as possible and ask them to arrange a marriage if, as you say, you cannot do without her.\n\nTell your parents that you are at risk of committing zina and they have to help protect you from that.This is far better for you than to go on meeting her and indulging in haraam. Whatever children you have after nikah will be legitimate. However, do remember that if you fall into shaitaans trap now before marriage, and you then have a child, teh child wil be illegitimate for you will be committing zina and this is a kabirah gunnah.\n\nI urge you to make nikah as soon as possible with the permission of parents on both sides. May Allah Ta'ala guide both of you and protect you from haraam and His wrath, ameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n1SOCIAL DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti"
