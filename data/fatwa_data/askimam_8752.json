  "question": "3) is it permissible for a women to shave her arms and other body parts, 1) Is the water in the US halal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have a few questions: 1) I am aware that the US purifies their tap water. However, I do not know how they purify their water. What if their water is being purified by ingredients derived from haram sources like animals, human hair and other byproduct and alcohol. Would it be permissible to consume the water even if that happens? Is the water in the US halal? 2.) I reside in the US and it has been brought to my attention that not all Halal meat stores sell Halal meat. I buy my meat from Pak-Hind grocers and questioned whether or not they did sell Halal meat. They gave me a set of numbers to call of where they buy their meat. I called each number and each supplier told me that all the meat they sold to Pak-Hind grocers is Zabiha, Halal meat. From what I know, THe Pak-Hind grocers Store does not carry official Halal certification; however, each of their suppliers told me that they sell Halal meat. Is it permmissble for me to consume their meat? 3) Also, is it permissible for a women to shave her arms and other body parts only if they are going to be revealed in a dress that covers her satar that she is going to wear only in the presence of other women?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Flowing water will be pure and consumable if it?s colour, smell or taste did not change due to the Haraam ingredients in the purification process. (Raddul Muhtaar, Vol. 1, Page 137-138).\n\n2. If the suppliers are righteous and honest Muslims, then it will be permissible to consume that meat. Similar will be the ruling if they are non-Muslims who are informing you that the meat is a Zabiha of a Muslim. It will not be permissible to consume that meat if the non-Muslim merely says that the meat is Halaal. (Raddul Muhtaar, Vol. 5, Page 242-243, Fataawaa Rashidiyyah, Page 585)\n\n3. It is permissible for women to shave their arms and other parts of their bodies besides their head.
