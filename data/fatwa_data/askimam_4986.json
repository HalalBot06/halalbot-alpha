  "answer": "QUESTION\nAfter slaughtering an animal, some people bend the head of the animal backwards, so as to break a few bones on the neck. The entire head is not removed from the body. This is said to cause the animal to die quicker. Is it permissible to do this?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis is not permissible. As long as life still remains, no bones may be broken.\n\nThe most humane method of slaughter, causing the least possible pain, is the\nmethod of the Sunnah, i.e. slaughtering on the neck and leaving the animal\nto die without any further pain.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Muhammad Kadwa"
