  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs KFC halah? We live in Dubai. on enquiring with KFC, they said the chicken comes from Saudi Arabia and is halal. But there is doubt if they use dead chicken. So is it better to refrain from it? \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe underlying principle in halal and haram is if there is a doubt, haram will prevail.\n\nFurthermore, the issue of halal and haram in consumable items includes everything- the chicken and all the ingredients. in which the chicken is made. The chicken alone being halal is not sufficient for it to be consumable in shariah.\n\nWe are not in a position to comment on the KFC ingredients being halal or not. You may conduct your own investigation regarding that through reliable and appropriate sources.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
