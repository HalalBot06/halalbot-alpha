  "question": "Is asking Dua in Sajdah od salaah the best time? Alcohol not from Grapes or dates and doesnâ€™t have the ability to intoxicate but from animal extract; can we use it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamualaikum dear Mufti sahibs and staff. 1) Is the best time to ask dua from Allah (SWT) in the Sajdah of Salaah since that?s where they are closest to Allah (swt)? I heard one may only make Dua in ARABIC in the sajda?s of Nafl salaah only. 2) If alcohol is NOT derived from Grapes or Dates but rather derived from any other fuit or even ANIMAL extracted but it?s end result within a certain product (eg. Hair Conditioner) does NOT have the ability to intoxicate, can such product be used in sharia?h?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. One may make du?aa in the Sajda of Nafl Salaat only in Arabic.\n\n2. If a product used for external use has alcohol from fruits other than grapes or dates, then it is permissible. We are not aware of alcohol from animals.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
