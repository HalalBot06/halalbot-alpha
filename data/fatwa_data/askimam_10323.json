  "question": "Whats the correct way to celebrate Eid?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nEid-ul-Fitr is an expression of a person to show his happiness upon his achievements in Ramadhaan. This out-pouring of happiness is to encourage a person to show gratitude to Allah for his bounties ? the bounty of having experienced Ramadhaan and having had the opportunity to better himself spiritually ? and the bounties of food and drink on the day of Eid. It is hoped that due to this celebration, a person will continue upon his achievements of Ramadhaan.%0D%0A%0D%0AEid-ul-Adha is to slaughter an animal ? to show and signify solidarity upon the sacrifices of Ibraahim [alayhis salaam] and his submission to Allah. By slaughtering an animal, to inculcate is the quality of sacrifice for the Deen of Allah, like Ibraahim [alayhis salaam] willingness to sacrifice his household in a barren land upon the order of Allah, his eagerness to sacrifice his son to fulfil the order of Allah, his eagerness to sacrifice himself so that the Oneness of Allah may prevail and idolatory may be abolished. The celebration of Eid-ul-Adha should have the spirit of these sacrifices behind it.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
