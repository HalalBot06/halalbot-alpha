  "question": "Can I marry a women with a specific condition to bear my child and after that to divorce her",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am thinking to marry a women to bear my child and I want to divorce her after paying her enough money. One women came forward for my proposal. Is it valid in Islam?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMarriage in Islam is a binding contract based on intention of both parties\nto live together permanently within the confines of the Shari'ah. The\ncondition to marry for a limited period is incorrect. It is similar to Muta\n(temporary marriage) propagated by the Shi'as.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
