  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is the authencity of the hadeeth reported by Baraa ibn Azib in ragarding the issue of Rafa al Yedain, can you provide me a list of scholars and how they did classify it.\n\nBaraa Ibnn Azib (radhiyallahu anhu) said: \"I saw Rasulullah (Sall Allahu alaihi wa Aalihi wa Sallim) raise his hands when he commenced the Salaat. Then he would not raise his hands until he completed (the Salaat).\"\n\nCause in some narrations the words THEN HE WOULD NOT REPEAT IT is not in it.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAt least, fourteen chains of the Hadith of Barraa ibn Azib [radhiallaahu anhu] with the words ‘then he would not repeat it’ can be found.\n\nWe refer you to Sharh Ma’anil Aathaar of Tahawi and Sunan of Dar-e-Qutni. This narration is further supported by a number of other Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhu] including ibn Umar, ibn Abbaas and Abbaad ibn Zubayr. These narrations may be found in Nasai Shareef, Bayhaqi, Bazzaar, Tabrani, etc.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
