  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have a confusion and i am sure your answer inshallah would benefit others too. there are a lot of times when we have to hide the truth in our lives like if we have to miss a class / work for some reason that we cannot disclose then we make another reasonable excuse.. and especially with realtionships like husband/wife, inlaws sometimes we have to say something incorrect (or lie) for a positive result, to stop a fight etc. its also called maslahat. its very common in everyday life and doesnt consider a lie, what does Islam say abt it? please explain\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, it is Haraam (prohibited) to hide the truth. However, the\nFuqahaa (jurists) exempt hiding the truth in the following situation:\n1. When there is fear of an oppressor harming the wealth and self of another\nMuslim.\n2. Joining ties between two people\n3. Husband and wife trying to please each other. (al-Adhkaar of Imaam Nawawi\npg.566; Darul Fikr)\n\nIn view of the above, hiding the truth from employers, in-laws, etc. is\nincorrect and prohibited.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
