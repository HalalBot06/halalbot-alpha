  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu alaikum mufti sab. 2) Normally I do not miss any Namaz. Some times due to meetings or tight schedules situation may come that I may have to miss namaz(Alhamdulillah till now I have not come across that situation). I used feel tension about that. I used to think if I miss any namaz because of my job, My income thru that job will be haram. Some time though I did the namaz,I get doubts whether my namaz is valid or not. My mind forces me to do namaz again.If do not do namaz again, I used to think that I am giving importance to job than namaz which is haram.So my income may be haram. Leaving namaz is haram no..Because of job if I am forced to miss the namaz. That job I can not do no.. If I do that job, Will the income of that job becomes haram ? I always feel tension abt this? Is my thinking correct? Some time if I have tight work, I get less time for namaz ofcourse I can complete namaz once. While doing namaz I used to feel tense whether I can complete namaz or not. Because of this tension, I used to get doubts while doing namaz.My concentration goes. Some times I get bad thoughts. I used to repeat namaz. Because of this I used to get angry and feel frustrated. Whenever there is tight work,that day I used to feel tense whether my namaz will go smoothly or not?Some times I used to get doubts whether my ghusl/vadhoo valid or not? My mental situation is not that good.Please suggest me how to think about namaz.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It seems as though you are confused with the enormous amounts of doubts%0D%0Athat cross your mind. In accordance to your question, Alhamdulillah, you can%0D%0Abe rest assured that all your Wudhu and Salaat are all valid. Your income is%0D%0AHalaal. You merely have a doubt that if you occupy yourself with your job%0D%0Aand in doing so you miss Salaat, then will your income be Halaal? This is a%0D%0Adoubt. It never ever happened and Insha Allah, it will not happen, so don't%0D%0Abother about it. There is no need to repeat your Salaat again or to perform%0D%0ADhuhr after Jummu'ah. Once you have performed Salaat, be rest assured that%0D%0Ayour Salaat is valid. As for the doubts that cross your mind regarding%0D%0AWudhu, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has taught us a Du'aa that we%0D%0Ashould constantly make, 'O Allah! I seek protection from Walahaan.'%0D%0A(Mishkaat pg.47; Qadeemi). Walahaan is the name of the devil that causes%0D%0Athese doubts to cross our minds.%0D%0AYou should also try to build, up confidence in yourself. Try to concentrate%0D%0Ain your Salaat and have confidence that the Salaat is valid.%0D%0A2. It will not be permissible for you to use the bathroom that has been%0D%0Aappointed to other people. You are merely working for a company. The company%0D%0Ais private and therefore, they have all the rights to reserve certain%0D%0Afacilities for certain people. You should use the bathroom that has been%0D%0Aappointed for you even though other people watch you perform Wudhu, etc.%0D%0ABuild up confidence and do not feel shy.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
