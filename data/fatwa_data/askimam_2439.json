  "question": "I find muslim names transliterated in too many ways. What is the proper way to transliterate the name that means proof? Is it Bourhan or Burhan?Which is the correct spelling?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe transliteration of any Muslim name would differ according to\npronunciation of the English Alphabet in different localities (due to\ndifferent accents). Therefore, whichever transliteration you feel is closest\nto the Arabic pronunciation would be the best.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
