  "question": "My future wife goes out alone with other boys should I pull out?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThis year I got engaged to a girl. I thought she was a religious girl. I see her around the city with boys and hugging them. I am told by people who go to her school that she only stays with boys. We are not allowed to talk or meet but I hear about her being alone with talking to and meeting boys. She makes a secret effort to see them. I don't keep any girls as friends because I want to keep that special for her but she is not doing the same. I feel she does not care for me the way I do for her and that religiously we are both going in different directions. Should I end this so that we don't get married and have problems? If I do marry her it will not be because of how strong her Islam is but for some other reason.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe are advised to exercise patience and restraint only if we are faced with%0D%0Asuch a problem that has no apparent solution to it. We are not advised to%0D%0Aenter into a problem. Rasulallah advised us to make dua for aafiyah%0D%0A(goodness). We are also advised not to make dua for Sabr, as that is%0D%0Aindirectly requesting for a problem in order to make sabr.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou are not required to endure patience to the girl you are engaged to if%0D%0Ayou do not want to marry her due to her loose relationship with boys.%0D%0ACompatibility in marriage is of paramount importance. It is the secret%0D%0Abehind a successful and happy marriage. Marriage partners that are not%0D%0Acompatible to one another are often engaged in disputes and more%0D%0Aunfortunately breaking in the marriage. That creates unbearable grief and%0D%0Aagony to the divorce partners as well as many families, friends, and%0D%0Aassociates. You did not state the other reason besides her Islam to marry%0D%0Aher. However, any approach towards%0D%0A%0D%0AMarriage besides Islam and piety is not an ideal one. You should reconsider%0D%0Athat by making Istighfar and seeking the honest guidance of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0Afor Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
