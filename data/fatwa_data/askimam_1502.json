  "question": "My relative recently passed away. He had a disease. As he was passing away he recited some Christan couplets (which are recited at church). Did he pass away as Muslim?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nBefore that he recited kalimah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe actual faith at the time of death of any person is only known to Allah\nTa'ala. Since the person recited the kalima, it is hoped he died as a\nMuslim. As regards the Christian couplets, we leave it to Allah to judge.\n\nWe advise you resort to dua and seek forgiveness for your relative. May\nAllah grant us all an honourable death in the state of Ieman. (Aameen)\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti E Desai\nFatwa Dept."
