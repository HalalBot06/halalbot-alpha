  "answer": "QUESTION\nI want to know what is the significance of burning incence sticks like Lobaan and agarbahti etc. I find that to be quiet a common practice especially during holy nights and Ramadhaan etc.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is no virtue and significance in Shari?ah for burning lobaan, agarbatti, etc. during the holy nights. If people practice that as Shari?ah, then it will be an act of Bid?at which must be shunned.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
