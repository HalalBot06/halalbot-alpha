  "question": "1.Can you interpret my dream: I was doing tawaaf around the kaaba while reciting the takbir",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n(Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar Laillaha Illalah Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar walilahil hamd) and I also kissed the black stone, there were very few people in the Haram, in the same dream I also went into a shoe store in Makkah and looked at a pair of green boots but did not buy them because they were made in Pakistan ( I don?t understand this at all). 2. My grandmother saw a dream in which she said she felt like she was at an airport and a man kept saying hurry up its time, your time is coming to leave. She said the man told her where to go. She said that she saw her dead sister in law in the dream who jumped off a mountain and my grandmother and her aunt said look at her she is crazy jumping off the mountain, let?s take the stairs instead. And she says the man in her dream kept asking her do you know where to go, you have very little time. Can please interpret this dream? 3. Can you tell me what duas I can read for my cousin who is 26 years old and is unmarried, so that Allah (SAW) may help her get married soon. We are all really worried about her. She is very religious (wears Hijaab), is educated (has a great job) and has good looks too but I don?t know why she is having trouble finding someone. Also, can you please make a special dua for her so that Allah (SAW) may create easiness for her so she can get married soon?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Alhamdulillah, the dream of making tawaaf around the Baytullah is very Mubaarak. May Allah Ta?ala grant us the tawfeeq to express true submission to Him in every aspect of our lives (tawaaf). It is very important to express our obedience to Allah in the manner shown to us by Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam]. We should avoid following culture (Pakistani shoes) as part of Deen (Makkah Mukarramah).\n\n2. Every one of us are always in the airport of death to take the flight to the hereafter. Life is very short and death is imminent. Indeed, death for a believer is a means of peace and removes all the difficulties (mountains) of this world.\n\n3. Recite ?rabbanaa hab lanaa min azwaajinaa wa dhurriyaatinaa qurrata a?ayunin waj-alnaa lil muttaqeena imaaman? 40 times every day and make Du?aa to Allah for a pious and compatible partner.\n\nMay Allah Ta?ala grant your cousin her hearts desire, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahi"
