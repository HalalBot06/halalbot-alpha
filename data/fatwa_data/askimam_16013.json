  "question": "Haidh : i want to know that the purity or impurity is decided on timely(hourly) basis or on the entire day.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nYou have mentioned that one should refer to last month's cycle to see when a woman becomes paak agian. Now i am faced with the following difficulty.\n(1) Suppose in my last month's periods the bleeding and later brown discharge finished on the 7th day Zuhr.This time also i will wait till Zuhr and then perform Ghusl and offer namaaz. Now my question is - if this time the last brown discharge occured only till the night of the 6th day and did not come on fajr of the 7th day like last time, will i have to make qada for isha(of the 6th day) and fajr(of the 7th day), since i waited till zuhr of the 7th day, but periods finished on isha of 6th day only.\n\n(2) Like i said I will perform Ghusl on 7th day zuhr(taking last month's cycle into consideration.) Now if by chance this month after performing Ghusl In Zuhr on 7th day, I see some brownish discharge before Asr. Then should i again perform Ghusl before As and offer Asr prayerr. And then again if i have some discharge before Maghrib , then shuld i again perform ghusl before maghrib, and similarly for isha. Since the last discharge is not fixed and it can occur anytime on the entire 7th day.\nIn short do i have to perform ghusl after every salaat once i cross the last month's time and the brown discharge continues or am i exempted for the day i bled(ie, the entire 7th day), and only perform ghusl the next day before fajr?\n\nI hope I am able to get my question across to you. Basically i want to know that the purity or impurity is decided on timely(hourly) basis or on the entire day.\nKindly reply as i do not want to miss any salaat.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAt the outset we would like to clarify that a woman should refer to the last month’s cycle only when her bleeding has exceeded the maximum number of days for haidh, i.e. 10 days. If she bleeds for more than three days and less than ten days, but differs to her habit in the last month, we will say that her habit has changed. Now the time of bleeding for this month will be regarded as her new habit.\n\nIn the light of the abovementioned, the answers to your queries will be as follows:\n\n(1) You will have to make qadha of Isha Salaah (on the 6th day) and Fajr Salaah (on the 7th day) as your haidh had stopped on the night of the 6th day. Now you will regard this timing as your new habit, and will refer to this habit if your bleeding exceeds 10 days in the following month.\n\n(2) If you happen to see any discharge after the time of Zuhr Salaah on the 7th, you will not pray any Salaah until the bleeding has completely stopped. If the bleeding stops completely before the completion of 10 days, then this new date will be regarded as your new habit. Now, you will not have to make qadha of any of the Salaahs that were left out.\n\nHowever, if the bleeding exceeds 10 days, then you will refer to the last month’s cycle. The discharge till Zohr Salaah on the 7th will be regarded as haidh and any discharge thereafter will be regarded as istihadhah. You will have to make qadha of all the Salaahs you had left out from Zohr Salaah on the 7th.\n\n(Bahishti Zewar (English Translation) Vol.1 Pg.89 – Zam Zam Publishers)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
