  "answer": "QUESTION\nClarification of Hadith. Please varify if such a hadith exists and its implications.I have heard that once a very tired and ill group of people were told by Nabi (SAW) to go and drink urine of camels belonging to certain tribe as it would cure them. If this hadith exists, what are we to learn from it, or what was the significance? Also, what is the best way to verify a hadith, heard from a non-alim. Are there any specific web-sites? Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis Hadith has been recorded by many of the Imaams of Hadith in their%0D%0Arespective books. From among them are: Imaam Bukhari in his Sahih and Imaam%0D%0AMuslim is his Sahih.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs it is mentioned in the narration itself, this was prescribed by%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) as a cure for illness that had%0D%0Aafflicted those people. This Hadith is used as proof for the permissibility%0D%0Aof usage of such medication which may contain any Haraam ingredients.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, the usage of such a medicine will only be permissible when there is%0D%0Ano other treatment available which does not include such ingredients. (See%0D%0AFathul Baari vol.1 pg.441). This is also manifest from the Aayat of the Qur'%0D%0Aaan, 'And he has explained to you in detail what is forbidden for you except%0D%0Aunder compulsion of circumstances.' (Al-An'aam 119)%0D%0A%0D%0AWe do not know of any such reliable site. The only way is to refer to an%0D%0Aexpert in the field of Hadith.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
