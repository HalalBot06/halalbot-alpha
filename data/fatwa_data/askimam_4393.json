  "question": "What is the difference between mu'ajjal, and mu'wajjal dowry on a nikkah certificate?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAsalamolakum, I am curious about the difference of dowry, mu'ajjal, and mu'wajjal as it is stated on my nikkah certificate. mu'ajjal is translated to prompt, and mu'wajjal deferred. I am assuming that mu'ajjal must be paid at the time of commencing the relationship, and mu'wajjal, upon seperation? what are the concequences and restrictions of not being able to pay either of these amounts? Can they be forgiven by the bride? Thank you mufti sahib.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nPrompt dowry is referred to as the Mahr agreed upon by both parties to be\npaid up front before the Nikah, at the time of the Nikah or before the\nconsummation of the marriage at the latest.\n\nMahr Mu'ajjal (deferred) is referred to as Mahr agreed upon by both parties\nto be paid after the consummation at some later date. This becomes payable\nimmediately upon separation or death. The wife may forgive her husband\nwholly or partially as far as the payment of the Mahr is concerned whether\nit is prompt or deferred.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
