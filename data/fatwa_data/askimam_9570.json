  "question": "Is there any dua for having sabr in wanting to get married asap?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have always said that I would want a wife with good islamic values who is intelligent and kind. Recently I have been having these urges to get married as soon as possible and I am afraid that I might make the wrong choice. I am attracted to beautiful girls however I am aware that beauty isnt everything. Is there something I can read to assist me in having patience for the right girl to come along and in making the right decision ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMaashaa Allah, how commendable to stay away from sin seeking the correct path.%0D%0A%0D%0AYes, first and foremost, keep your eyes lowered as commanded in the Qur?aan. Avoid lustful gazes and see immediate rewards, Insha Allah. May have responded with enjoying the ?sweetness of Imaan?. %0D%0A%0D%0ASecondly, look for a pious girl ? beauty, a bonus ? ask Allah Ta?ala for the best, both spiritual and physical beauty. See the girl as directed according to the Sunnah. Make Istikhaara, if positive, you have made Du?aa and correct effort ? resign to the will of Allah Ta?ala and appreciate. Whenever you marry, love her and treat her well. Also remember, spiritual beauty is absolutely beneficial. Consider physical beauty eventually wanes over the years ? you will become old and so will the woman - crinkles, bent bones and hair falling. With divine spiritual love, you will always find your wife beautiful. %0D%0A%0D%0AConsider also (as a very pious sage explains) the ?Miss world? crowned for her beauty ? meets with an accident on her way to the hotel, her face is scarred irreparably for life. The media and the world forsake her running after another beauty to crown. Hence, no guarantee if you marry for beauty. Ask your creator for the best and appreciate love for whomsoever you marry.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta?ala bless you with a beautiful pious wife and children, aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A2SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
