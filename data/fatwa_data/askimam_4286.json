  "question": "Explanation of a dream.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs Salamaleykum Mufti Saheb, About 2 months ago, I had a dream that I was in a Masjid in the woman?s section, where a prayer is going on. All the women were praying, while I was at the end sitting with a Quran and following what the Imam saab who was reciting the prayer. I don?t know why, I wasn?t praying. So anyhow, when the Imam came to a Rukuh, the ladies thought it was time for Sajda, but since I was following the imam through the Quran, I knew he had just paused, and the Surah hadn?t finished. Therefore, when the women bent down, I told them to stand up, since the imam has just paused, and it wasn?t Sijda. After all the women were finished praying, I then saw myself praying at the end. Could u please, tell me how this dream specifically relates to me. And also, I love reading the Quran everyday, by English translation, it gives me the strength to live life, by Allah(SWT?s) order. Thankyou very much, brother.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream is a reflection of your love to recite the Quran and understand\nits contents. May Allah increase the love of the Quran in our hearts and\ngrant us understanding of the Quran.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
