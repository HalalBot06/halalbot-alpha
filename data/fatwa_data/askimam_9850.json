If there is any possibility that any body can make nikah if his or her vakeel is non Muslim or Kafir. If it is not possible than how Hadrat Abu Talib was vakeel of Hadrat Mohammad (P.B.U.H). at the time of nikkah. If he was vakeel of Hadrat Mohammad (P.B.U.H) so its mean that he was Muslim at that time, and who said this word first \"Alhamdolillahay Rabil A Lameen\" Q2. What is the incident of Gadeer.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. At the time of his Nikah, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was 25 years old. He only received prophehood at the age of 40, after which all the laws of Islam were revealed and became applicable. Therefore, Abu Taalib being the Wakeel was prior to the advent of Islam.\n\n2.
