  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCould you confirm if there is an opinion of permissibility on crabs as per your Fatwa # 18321?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nWe have been notified of a misconception which arouse from Fatwa number 18321 (http://askimam.org/fatwa/fatwa.php?askid=d04013b28a21924be02997357a7cff54).\n\nThe fatwa should have been worded differently. Although some contemporary scholars opine that a crab is fish and no consideration should be given to science, none of the classical scholars ever classified a crab as fish. There is a consensus amongst traditional scholars and hence, crabs will NOT be permissible according to the Hanafi madhab.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
