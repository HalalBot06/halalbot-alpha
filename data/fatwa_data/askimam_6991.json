  "question": "I want to spent time in Medina in Ramadan with my family. My friend is asking me to go in Jamath and leave my family at home.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy friend will look after them and he will stay with his wife at my home (presently I am in Saudi). Is it allowed to do so from shariath point of view? My eldest son is of 8 years age. (FIQH)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for your friend to be in the same house with you wife in your absence. Your friend?s wife being with him does not make a difference.\n\nYou may go out in Jamaat with your wife or leave your family at home by herself. You may request your friend to take care of your family through his wife and not directly.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
