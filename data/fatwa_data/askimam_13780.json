  "question": "Fr the first seven days, the discharge is red then for the rest 21-22 days it varies from month to month.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a question about my menses…I have asked a few scholars about it and read some books, but no one has given me an answer yet about my specific case, therefore, every time I have my menses, I get very confused and don’t know what to do…\n\n \n\nThe way I get it is like the following:\n\nFr the first seven days, the discharge is red then for the rest 21-22 days it varies from month to month.\n\n) Sometimes I can get yellow discharge from days 8 to 13 and then no discharge from days 14 to 17 then yellow discharge from day 17 to 21. \n\n2) Or I can get yellow discharge from days 8 to 16 then no discharge from days 17 to 20 then yellow discharge on days 21-22.\n\n3) And sometimes, I can get continuous discharge from day 8 till day 21.\n\n4) Also sometimes I might get yellow discharge from days 8 to 12, then no discharge on days 13-15, then discharge on days 16-18 then no discharge on days 18-21.\n\n5) And sometimes it’s even different than that.\n\nSo can u please give me the general ruling regarding my case so I can apply it any time I see yellow discharge…I read the answer where it says that if I see yellow discharge after or before I see red discharge then it is menstruation, if I see it any time other time, then it is istihadah, but this doesn’t work when I apply it to my case because it would be more than 10 days….What I normally do is stop praying when I see the red discharge and after 10 days, I start praying again until I see the red discharge in the next month….so I stop praying 10 days and pray for around 18-19 days…..is that correct?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYour matter is simple and clear. Your menses will be from the time you get a red discharge until the completion of the tenth day. It is immaterial that the colour of the discharge after the red discharge is yellow or any other colour besides white within the ten day period.\n\nYour discharge after ten days will be Istihaadha until you get the red discharge again the next month. You will be regarded as pure during your Istihaadha. Perform Wudhu at the beginning of every Salaat time.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
