Jazakallah: http://www.understanding-islam.com/related/questions.jsp?point=3&id=1408 web-site is www.understanding-islam.comQuestion: Is the separation of women in social gatherings truly an Islamic concept or has it come from ancient Persian cultural practice? Are women allowed to mix freely (as long as it is in an honorable and humble way) with men in an Islamic setting?RonnieAnswer: The fact that Islam has prescribed certain etiquette of interaction between males and females is evidence itself that Islam does not prohibit interaction between males and females. However, because adherence to the etiquette prescribed by Islam may be seen as a hindrance in a desired free and frank atmosphere of a social gathering, therefore, more conservative Muslims generally like to arrange their gatherings in such a way that there is a separation between men and women attending the gathering. Nevertheless, such separate arrangement of gatherings, though it seems to be in keeping with the spirit of the social directives of Islam, cannot be termed as a requirement of the Shari`ah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIslam promotes the segregation of the sexes as a religious obligation and%0D%0Anot as a cultural tradition as claimed by this author. There are a number of%0D%0AAhaadith to substantiate this obligation.%0D%0A%0D%0AA person who claims that free intermingling of sexes is permitted is guilty%0D%0Aof an act of Kufr. Refer below.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Kadwa%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is rather unfortunate that sin and evil has become so rife nowadays that%0D%0Apeople don't even regard sin as sin anymore and how true are the words of%0D%0Aour beloved Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), 'A time will dawn upon man%0D%0Athat Zina (adultery) will become so widespread that the most pious man in%0D%0Athis world will be that person who witnesses two people doing evil on the%0D%0Astreet pavement. This person would go up to them and say to them that go and%0D%0Ado your action behind a tree, he will not stop them from the evil rather he%0D%0Awould tell them that instead of doing it in front of everybody, go and do%0D%0Ayour actions behind a tree. The person who tells them this will be the most%0D%0Apious person. Today, we are presently experiencing the above adultery is%0D%0Abeing done openly, everywhere without any prohibition or obstruction.'%0D%0A(Islahi Khutubaat, Mufti Taqi Usmani vol.7 pg.32)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn an Aayat of the noble Qur'aan, Allah Ta'ala commands the believers, 'Say%0D%0A(O' Muhammad) unto the believers lower your gazes and protect your private%0D%0Aparts. That is more pure for you. Verily, Allah is all informed of what you%0D%0Aare doing.' (Surah Nur). Evil glances is to look at any Ghayr Mahram%0D%0Aespecially with desire or to attain pleasure whether the person is alive or%0D%0Ait is a picture. Both situations are totally Haraam. The greatest hindrance%0D%0Afor the reformation and purification of the innerself is the sin of evil%0D%0Aglances. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) explained in a Hadith, 'Evil%0D%0Aglances is a poisonous arrow from the arrows of Iblees.' (Majmauz Zawaaid%0D%0Avol.8 pg.63)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another Hadith, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) mentioned, '. The Zina%0D%0Aof the eyes is in evil glances and Zina of the ears is by listening (to%0D%0Aevil) and Zina of the tongue speaking (about evil) and Zina of the hands is%0D%0Ain touching (forbidden) and Zina of feet is in walking (towards evil) and%0D%0Athe heart desires and hopes (in evil) and thereafter the private parts%0D%0Aaccepts that (acts upon it) or rejects it.' (Mishkaat pg.20)%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore, according to Shari'ah, to look, speak, listen, etc. to any Ghayr%0D%0AMahram except at the time of extreme necessity is Haraam and impermissible.%0D%0AIn an Aayat of the noble Qur'aan, Allah Ta'ala says, 'And when you ask (his%0D%0Awives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen. That is purer%0D%0Afor your hearts and their hearts.' Although the reason for revelation is a%0D%0Aspecific incident and the wives of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) are%0D%0Aspecifically mentioned but this is general for the entire Ummah, i.e. if%0D%0Athe woman wants to get something from the men, e.g. utensils, clothing, etc.%0D%0Athus, she not come in front of him, rather ask for it from behind a veil.%0D%0A(Ma'aariful Qur'aan vol.7 pg.200; Idaaratul Ma'aarif)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another Aayat, Allah Ta'ala says, 'And stay in your homes and do not%0D%0Adisplay yourselves, like that at the time of ignorance.' (Surah Ahzaab 33%0D%0Avol.33). Therefore, the command unto women is to stay at home and only come%0D%0Aout at the time of a necessity which is sanctioned by the Shari'ah, should a%0D%0Aneed arise, total Shar'ee Hijaab should be adhered to.%0D%0A%0D%0ABy a person fighting his Nafs and saving himself from sinning, he will%0D%0Aattain the sweetness of Imaan. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'A%0D%0Athought comes into a person to cast evil glances and who is that person who%0D%0Adoesn't get these thoughts and his heart is also encouraging him to just%0D%0Atake a look! But he fears Allah and saves himself by not casting an evil%0D%0Aglance. This will cause a great burden but Allah Ta'ala will grant such%0D%0Asweetness of Imaan that he won't even consider looking in future.' (Ahmad%0D%0Avol.5 pg.264)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is, therefore, imperative that awareness should be created amongst the%0D%0AMuslim students to both male and female regarding the importance and laws of%0D%0AShari'ah especially with regards to Hijaab and intermingling of the sexes.%0D%0AThe administration of MSA should be encouraged to adhere to the laws of%0D%0AShari'ah, contextually, the laws of Hijaab."
