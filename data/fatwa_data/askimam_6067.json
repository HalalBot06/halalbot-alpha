  "question": "I was looking for the commonly quoted Hadith, that Duâ€™aa does not get, or will not be, accepted for 40 days if one eats something Haraam, if such a Hadith exists.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe have come across the following: Sayyiduna Abdullah ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Whoever consumer intoxicants, his Salaat will not be accepted for 40 days? (Sunan Tirmidhi vol.2 pg.8; Mustadrak Hakim vol.4 pg.146)%0D%0A%0D%0AImam Tirmidhi has classified this Hadith as Hasan (sound). (Ibid and Tahfatul Ahwazi vol.5 pg.489) and Imaam Hakim has classified as Sahih (authentic). Imam Dhahabi (RA) has also attested to this. (Mustadrak al-Haakim vol.4 pg.146)%0D%0A%0D%0ASimilar narrations from various other Sahaabah been recorded by Imaam Dawud Hadith3672, ibn Habbaan in his Sahih Hadith5357 and others. (refer al-Targheeb vol.3 pg.265-266)%0D%0A%0D%0AHafiz al-Munaawiy (RA) whole commentating on this Hadith mentions, ?The reason for Salaat being specifically mentioned is that it is the highest form of worship. And if is not acceptable in such a state the other acts of worship are more likely to also be unacceptable.? (Faydhul Qadeer vol.6 pg.158).%0D%0A%0D%0ANote that Du?aa is also an act of worship. However, as is evident, this Hadith discusses intoxicants only. Whether the same applies to all other Haraam items as well remains ambiguous though there is a strong possibility.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
