  "question": "Can I watch sports on TV?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI do not use the TV to watch any other programmes but sports such as Cricket, Soccor & motor racing. It is not practical and financially viable for me to go and watch these sports live so can I watch it on TV as it happens or a delayed transmission?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe amount of filth and immodesty that is found on the TV screens is\nunimaginable. Zina (adultery) of eyes, ears and mind is done is a wholesale\nmanner.\n\nBesides this, there are numerous other psychological and moral harms of the\nTV. Leave alone other programmes, even the sport programmes are inundated\nwith filth. Also, the Hadith has totally prohibited the keeping or making of\npictures. By watching TV, valuable time is being wasted and we receive no\nbenefit physically or spiritually. It is, therefore, not permissible to\nwatch the TV.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
