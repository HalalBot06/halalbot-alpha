  "answer": "QUESTION\nAsalam u alaikum Mufti sahib. (i)When one makes intention so the reward of the deed goes to the deceased,(e.g reciting Sura Yasin) does the person who performs the virtuous act also get ANY reward? Someone stated that if that was the case,then bad deeds can also be transferred if the intention was for someone else.(which is silly) (ii)Someone said gaps should be left on the side of the dead body when being placed in the grave, because the dead sit up etc..Is this true? (iii)(a question from friend)when i was not practising, I bought a jacket in a shop and switched the price tags to a cheaper one.Now that I am practising, can he read salat,dhikr, etc.. in that jacket or is it better to give it away? iv)In nafil salat,can supplications in sajdah be made in any language if one does not no arabic? wasalam. May Allah reward you for your efforts.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) When anyone does any good deed, he can make the intention that Allah Ta'%0D%0Aala should transfer the reward of this good deed to any deceased person.%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala is not unjust, that he should make an innocent person bear the%0D%0Aburden of another. Yes, Allah Ta'ala is kind, and allows some to benefit%0D%0Afrom the good acts of others.%0D%0A2) There is no substantiation for the practice of leaving some gap on the%0D%0Aside of the body. It is not a sunnah practice. If there was any need for it%0D%0Athen Rasulullah Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam would have taught it to us.%0D%0A3) The difference in price should be returned to the store. One can do this%0D%0Aby writing a letter to the store explaining the situation, and including the%0D%0Aamount that the store was cheated. One may remain anonymous if one wishes%0D%0Ato, and can include a postal order.%0D%0A4) In Salaah one may only supplicate in Arabic. This applies to Nafl as%0D%0Awell. Outside of Salaah one may supplicate in any language.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
