  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have recently over the last 8/9monthes ?reverted? to Islam ? I am a white English male 20yrs. Firstly I am considering adopting an Islamic name and would like to know whether it is permissible to adopt the name Mahdi > rightly guided > straight path? Secondly are there any dua?s a newly revert can recite? and finaly can u recommend a translation of the Holy Quran with runnin commentary and detaild explanations of eacy ayat which is written in a simple form and easy to understand?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is very pleasing to hear that Allah has guided you to the truth. Yes it would be perfectly permissible to take the name Mahdi. It seems a really appropriate one. May Allah increase you in guidance. While there aren't any specific duas to be recited by a new muslim, you would be encouraged to recite the various duas narrated from Nabi (Sallalahu alaihi wasallam) to be recited every morning and evening. These can be found in any dua kitab.\n\nWe would recommend the tafsir \"Mariful Quran\" by Mufti Shafi Uthmani. To date 7 volumes have been translated into English. It is available in many Islamic bookshops as well as on many online Islamic stores. It is a bit detailed, so if you wish for something more concise, then a good choice would be Tafsir Uthmani, translated into English and published by Madrasah Arabia Islamia, Azadville. They could be contacted on darululum@webmail.co.za.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
