A amount of USD 1200 which she has given as loan to a friend It costs about USD to 1500 perform a Hajj from where we currently reside. Her monthly income is an allowance of USD 50 which I provide. Our questions are is Hajj is fardh on her. 1. Based on the monetary situation 2. Based on the family situation with two kids to take care of 3. Is it obligatory on me the husband to take her for Hajj if she does not have the capacity Wa Jazakum Allah Khair\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYour wife has approximately U$D8000 (jewellery and cash at hand). Hajj has become Fardh on her as that amount is sufficient for her and her Mahram.\n\nIf there are no alternate arrangements to take care of the children, then that is a valid reason in Shariâ€™ah to delay the performing of Hajj. However, in the case of death, she will have to make a Wasiyyat (bequest) of Hajj-e-Badal.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
