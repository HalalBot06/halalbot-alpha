  "question": "Sometimes i fear that my love for the Prophet is more than Allah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSometimes i fear that my love towards Hazoor Sallalah hoo alleh wasalam. Is more then that towards Allah. Although i know that my love towards Allah should be more than anyone else.\n\nSame goes with fear of meeting Hazoor Sallalah hoo alleh wasalaam on Hoze-Kusthar is more than standing in front of Allah.\n\nAlthough complete deen has to be implemented in our lives. Please inform what amaal to do regularly to be with Hazoor Sallah hoo alleh wasalam in jaanah. That is my most wish to be with him in jannah then any other thing...\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nRasulullah صلى الله عليه وسلم   said “A person will be with whom he loves on the Day of Qiyaamah”. Your love for Rasulullah صلى الله عليه وسلم  is indeed an expression of your strong Imaan. May Allah increase you in your love and make it a means of your entrance into Jannah.  \n\nThe only way to maintain this love for Rasulullah صلى الله عليه وسلم  is to continue following his Sunnah and lifestyle. The sincerity of ones claim will be judged by the life he leads and his consciousness with regards to adhering to the Sunnah practices. There are many who claim to love him but abandon his Sunnah. Such claims are void of any reality and serves as a mere lip service.\n\nShaytaan also seeks to advance his cause and agenda by fooling people in this regard. He creates wishful thinking in ordinary people that we dearly love Rasulullah and express our sincere love for him. These ordinary people become lost in these thoughts and neglect their duties to Almighty Allah. It is therefore imperative that one consults with an Alim or Shiekh (one who has underwent spiritual reformation under the guidance of a mentor) and inform him of ones spiritual condition and take his advise on how to progress without been mislead by Shaytaan and his deception.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
