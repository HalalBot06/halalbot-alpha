  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaikum, Respected Mufti I had a dream a little while ago and I would like to have the dream interpreted please. The dream was as follows: I was at a coastal town either on holiday or living there. I went out to visit a client and while there, there was huge tidal wave that engulfed the building i was in and all surrounding areas. The water however did not enter the building and I emerged safely all the while another wave was coming towards the shore. I then ran to a spot near the shore and started perfoming two rakaats salaah, other ppl joined and made me the Imam. I remember reading in the 1st Rakaat Suraah Al-Kafirun and in the 2nd Suraah Al-Ikhlaas. As the Salaat progressed more and more ppl joined until the congregation was very large. While the Salaah was in progress the Wave started disipating.After the Salaah ppl around me started embracing me and I noticed two ppl in white Islamic Dress with red scarves coming to embrace me, I somehow think that they were Arabs, I greeted them and embraced them and went to check on my family and everybody was smiling and welcoming me. Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe huge waves is an indication of Fitna and corruption. Performing Salaat\nin the midst of the waves is an indication of submission to Allah in the\nmidst of evil and corruption.\n\nReciting Surah Kaafiroon refers to negating Kufr and disbelief. Surah\nIkhlaas is an expression of the Oneness of Allah. In essence, both Surahs\nrefer to Imaan which is the only deterrent against corruption and disbelief.\nWhen one person is strong in his Imaan, that will effect the hearts of\nothers and which will be appreciated by them and Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
