  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have taken loan of Saudi Riyal 500, i am going for hajj, now i have 1000 riyals with me as my saving for hajj, if i pay back the loan, i will be left with only 500 riyals, i see that i may fall short of money by that time if i repay now, so i will have to wait till i get money, i mean the next pay, even then i will be left with only 500+800 Riyals, i need around 2000 Riyals, to comfortably do my hajj. in this situation 1) can i delay the repaying till the completion of hajj? 2) shall i pay the amount first and take another loan before going to hajj? 3) i have NOT told them, that i will repay after hajj, i told them that i will pay back as soon as i get my next pay, the time is already over, the person lives 500kms away from my place to whom i owe the money i din visit him after the trip in which i took money on loan, am i under sin? 4) shall i take more time from them? 5) or shall i return them the due amount as its due time is over and take the new amount as loan from the same person or someone else?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou are owing this person money and the debt is due that you should explain your situation to him and ask him for more time. If he refuses then you should pay him. If the amount left over after paying him is insufficient, you can borrow money from another if you intend doing haj this year and you could pay him back when you get paid again.\n\nIf you are unable to get a loan or don't wish to, then you could delay your haj until next year.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
