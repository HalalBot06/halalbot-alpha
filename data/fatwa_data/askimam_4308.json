  "question": "Do you agree that the message of Allah s.w.t. has still not reached so many people. During the days, when communication and travel were less developed, it may not have reached an even greater number.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSo, how do you believe these people will be accounted for dying in a state of Kufr?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe do agree with you. The possibility cannot be ruled out.
