Jazakallahu Khairun!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has shown a simple solution in a Hadith, ?Exchange gifts for this enhances love.? We suggest you offer him gifts and try to make him comfortable in every possible way.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. It is Makrooh (disliked) to use toothpatse while fasting. If the foam of toothpaste slips down the throat, the fast will become invalidated.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Q: Kindly explain when does vomit invalidate fasting.%0D%0AA: The Fuqahaa have explained different types of vomit. We hereby simplify them as follows: Uninduced (involuntary) or induced. Each of the two could either be mouthful or less than a mouthful. Thus, there exist four possible cases: (a) Uninduced - mouthful, (b) Uninduced - less than a mouthful, (c) Induced - mouthful, (d) Induced - less than a mouthful. The vomit in each of these cases could either: a) Exit from the mouth, b) Unintentionally swallowed, c) Intentionally swallowed. Only two situations invalidate the fast, a) Uninduced - mouthful - intentionally swallowed, b) Induced - mouthful irrespective of whether it is swallowed or not. (Darse Tirmidhi vol.2; Darul Uloom Karachi)%0D%0A%0D%0A4. If the fast will not cause the sickness to worsen, it is permissible to fast. (Fiqhul Hanafi vol.5 pg.438)%0D%0A%0D%0A5. The fundamental reason for us to fast is that it is the command of Allah. As slaves of Allah, we express our slavery and servitude to Him and obey all His commands.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. Short Durood: Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam (O Allah, shower your blessings upon him). Another Durood: Allaahumma salli alaa muhammadin wa alaa aali muhammadin, annabiyyi kamaa yunbaghiy lanaa annusallee Alayhi, wa salli alaa muhammadin, annabiyyi kamaa amartanaa annusallee Alayhi (O Allah, send your blessings on the messenger, Muhammad, in numbers of your creatures that send, and send your blessings on the messenger Muhammad as is appropriate for us to send, and send blessings on the messenger Muhammad, as you have commanded us to send)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
