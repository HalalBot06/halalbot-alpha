  "answer": "QUESTION\nKindly explain the Shariah ruling of inheritance in the following instance: For a woman who would leave behind her husband, her mother, two brothers, two sisters-in-law (married to her two brothers), 4 nephews and 3 nieces. Please give the meaning of the name Nawhal in arabic/urdu.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Islamic Law of Succession and Inheritance, distribution of an Estate will only commence after funeral expenses, debts (including legal costs) and bequests (if any) made to non-heirs - which will not exceed one-third (1/3) of the Estate after debts and funeral expenses - have been settled. Thereafter, all assets form part of the Nett Estate and will have to be distributed according to the Islamic Law of Succession and Inheritance.\n\nThe nett estate will be divided into 6 equal shares and distributed as follows: Husband receives 3 shares; Mother receives 1 share and each brother receives 2. Sisters-in-law, nephews and nieces do not inherit.\n\nWe are unable to locate the meaning of Nawhal.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
