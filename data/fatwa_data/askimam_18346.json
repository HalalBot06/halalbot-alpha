  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni would like to ask about eddat after khula or devorse on demand.my husband in dubai even we not meet before 2 months.we do eddat?and what its sharraiet and duration.from when eddat starts when he sign papers or when i recive papers?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nKhul’a is when the wife offers to forgive the mahr owed to her by the husband or offers to give him a certain amount of money in lieu of him issuing divorce. When the husband agrees to give the khul’a, it will result in a talaqa baa’inah (one irrevocable divorce) and the iddah will commence. If he has not verbally agreed, rather, he has only agreed on paper than iddah will commence when he signs the papers. . On the other hand if the husband does not agree to the khul’a then there will be no talaq or iddah, since he must agree in order for the khul’a to take place.     \n\nThe duration of the iddah consists of three complete menstrual cycles. A woman observing the iddah is not allowed to re-marry until she has completed her iddah.\n\n \n\n(Aap Ki Masa’il Aur Unka Hal, 5/ 392, 414, Ludhyanwi)\n\n \n\nومن جانب المرأة يعتبر بالإيجاب والقبول كما في باب البيع...\n(المحيط البرهاني، 5/ 59، العلمي)\n\nفالحرة تعتد بثلاث حيض، أو ثلاثة أشهر...\n(المحيط البرهاني، 5/ 226، العلمي)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
