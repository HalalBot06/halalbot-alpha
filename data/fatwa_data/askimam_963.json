  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was wondering if Jesus (pbuh) was going to come back during the time of judgement day. I would like to know where in the Qu'ran it says this or talks about it.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n%0D%0AHadhrat Eesa (Alayhis salaam) will return to the%0D%0Aearth before the day of%0D%0AQiyaamat. Our belief is that Hadhrat Eesa (Alayhis%0D%0Asalaam) was elevated to%0D%0Athe skies and since every person will have to taste%0D%0Adeath, Eesa (Alayhis salaam) will return to earth and experience death.%0D%0A%0D%0AHis return to earth is regarded as one of the major%0D%0Asigns of Qiyaamat as recorded in many authentic Ahaadith recorded in Bukhari, Muslim and Abu%0D%0ADawud.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE SIGNS OF QIYAAMAH%0D%0AThe exact date of Qiyaamah is known to only Allah Ta'ala. The actual time of%0D%0AQiyaamah has not been revealed to anyone and there is absolutely no way or%0D%0Ameans by which this time can become known to anyone. Recently some misguided%0D%0Aelements have suggested that the exact date of Qiyaamah can be unravelled%0D%0Awith the aid of computer. To subscribe to such a fallacy is kufr.%0D%0A%0D%0AAlthough the exact date of Qiyaamah is unknown, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam) mentioned some events and signs by means of which the%0D%0AProximity of Qiyaamah may be deduced. The signs of Qiyaamah are of two%0D%0Akinds. The lesser signs and the greater signs.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE LESSER SIGNS%0D%0AThe lesser signs of the proximity of Qiyaamah mentioned by Rasulullah%0D%0A(sallallahu alayhi wasallam) are:%0D%0A1. Waqf wealth and property will be regarded as private property. Those%0D%0APeople or trustees in charge of trust property and money will misuse these%0D%0Ato suit their desires.%0D%0A2. Zakaat will be considered a fine or penalty. Those upon whom Zakaat is%0D%0Aobligatory will be reluctant to pay up the Zakaat for which they are liable.%0D%0A3. The husband will be subservient to the wife. She will lead him and he%0D%0Awill submit to her unlawful dictates.%0D%0A4. People will disobey their mothers and regard their fathers as strangers%0D%0Awhile considering friends to be their close associates.%0D%0A5. The Knowledge of Deen will be pursued and acquired to earn the world.%0D%0AIlm-e-Deen will be acquired for motives other than the pleasure of Allah%0D%0ATa'ala. Such persons who are immoral, evil and the worst in character will%0D%0Aassume the reigns of political power and government. Public and governmental%0D%0Aleaders will be those smitten by greed and desire. They will be wholly%0D%0Aunqualified for the posts they will be occupying.%0D%0A6. People will praise and honour tyrants so as to be saved from their%0D%0Apersecutions.%0D%0A7. Alcohol will be consumed publicly.%0D%0A8. Dancing and singing women will become rampant.%0D%0A9. Musical instruments will be in abundance.%0D%0A10. Ignorance of the Deen will increase greatly.%0D%0A11. The Knowledge of the Deen will rapidly decrease.%0D%0A12. Speaking lies will be regarded as a profession. The western courts of%0D%0Alaws with their prosecutors, lawyers and advocates are classical examples of%0D%0Athis prophesy.%0D%0A13. Fornication will become rampant. Shame and modesty will be eliminated.%0D%0A14. The control and domination of the Kuffaar will be established all over.%0D%0A15. False ways and evil practices will be on the rise.%0D%0A16. People will expand their businesses to such an extent that they will%0D%0Aintroduce their womenfolk into their business ventures to assist them.%0D%0A17. Increase in natural disasters, e.g. earthquakes.%0D%0A18. Maskh or disfiguring of human faces.%0D%0A19. The female population will increase so much that a single man will be%0D%0Athe overseer (seeing to the needs) of 50 women.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE GREATER SIGNS%0D%0A1. The advent of Hadhrat Imaam Mahdi (alayhis salaam).%0D%0A2. The second advent or Nuzool (Descent) of Nabi Isa (alayhis salaam).%0D%0A3. The emergence of Dajjal.%0D%0A4. The emergence of Ya'jooj Ma'jooj.%0D%0A5. The forty day fog.%0D%0A6. The night of three nights.%0D%0A7. The rising of the sun in the west.%0D%0A8. The emergence of Daab-batul Ardh or the Reptile from the earth.%0D%0A9. The Breeze.%0D%0A10. The reign of Africans. These greater signs will now be explained in some%0D%0Adetail."
