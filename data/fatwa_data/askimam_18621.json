  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nI would like to know the proper etiquettes of hugging another Muslim. When greeting someone, are you suppose to hug first towards your left then right then left, or right left right?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIn principle, it is preferable to hug once in such a manner that each individual touches the right part of the neck of the other.\n\n \n\n(Ahsanul Fatāwa, Vol. 8, Pg.407, Sa῾īd)\n\n \n\n \n\n “Nabi sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam loved to start with the right side as much as possible in everything.”\n\n \n\n(Sunan Abi Dawūd, Vol.4, Pg.118) [1]\n\n \n\nThe purpose of making Mu῾ānaqah (hugging) is to express love which is in one’s heart. In the case when the person hugs from the left, the hearts will come closer to each other. For this reason, it is preferable to hug from the left which is the general practice of the people.\n\n \n\n(Ahsanul Fatāwa, Vol. 8, Pg.411, Sa῾īd)\n\n \n\nIn our custom, it is common that people hug by pressing ones chest onto the chest of the other which is also permissible. Hugging in such a way that the stomachs of each person touches the other is not established in shari῾a and should be left out.  The Ulama have mentioned many harms with regards to hugging in this manner.\n\n \n\n(Ahsanul Fatāwa, Vol. 8, Pg. 407, Sa῾īd)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl. Abdur Rahman Shareef,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[1]    حدثنا حفص بن عمر ومسلم بن إبراهيم قالا حدثنا شعبة عن الأشعث بن سليم عن أبيه عن مسروق عن عائشة قالت كان رسول الله -صلى الله عليه وسلم- يحب التيمن ما استطاع فى شأنه كله فى طهوره وترجله ونعله.\n\n(سنن أبي داود،باب في الإنتعال،دار الكتاب العربي ـ بيروت)"
