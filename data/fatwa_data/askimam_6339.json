  "question": "Finding a partner is so difficult,is this bcos we nearing qiyamah&there r more women than men?its very difficult to get married.please advise?im making dua etc.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe agree that times are difficult. However, we should do what is within our\nability, within the framework of the Shari'ah, and leave the rest in the\nhands of Allah Ta'ala.\n\nIf a woman finds a suitable partner, then with the dignified norms of Islam,\nshe may propose to such a male. It is most unfortunate that society frowns\non such actions. Also, if men, within the correct Islamic spirit, have more\nthan one wife, then this situation can be to a far degree alleviated. These\nare simply some thoughts on the issue. In the final analyses, we have to\nresign our affairs unto Allah Ta'ala and continue making Du'aa. An abundance\nof Durood is also efficacious in finding a suitable partner.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
