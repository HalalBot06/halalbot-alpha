  "question": "1.) What is the importance of the ‘Day of Arafaat’, for people who are not in Hajj, and how should they observe it? 2. Should it be observed on the same day as in Makkah, or per the local calendar?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nFor Q2 as an example, this year (2002 C.E./1422 Hijri) Yaum-e-Arafaat (9th of Thoul Hajjah) falls on Thursday (Feb 21st) in Saudi Arabia, but in Chicago, it falls on Friday (Feb 22nd). It?s confusing on which day I should fast and observe it. Second issue is, in other neighboring cities, like Detroit, here in the USA, Eid-ul-Adha has been declared to be on Friday, based on the Saudi calendar, but in Chicago, the committees have declared it to be on Saturday. But still several people are observing it on Friday, even my sister who lives close to my house is observing it on Friday, whereas I am fasting this day (being the 9th). How can this be addressed, and what should the correct stance be?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHajj with all its rituals is restricted to the specific places, e.g. Mina,%0D%0AArafaat, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, one should involve himself in Ibaadat and Dhikr keeping the%0D%0Agreatness of the day in mind. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) mentions in%0D%0AHadith on the authority of ibn Abaas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that, 'There is no%0D%0Adays greater in the sight of Allah and there are no days in which actions%0D%0Aare beloved to Allah Ta'ala than 10 days of Dhul Hijjah. Hence, increase in%0D%0Ait Tasbeeh (recitation of Subhaanallah), Tahmeed (recitation of%0D%0AAlhamdulillah), Tahleel (recitation of Laa ilaaha illallaah) and Takbeer%0D%0A(recitation of Allaahu Akbar). (Mutajirur raabih pg.418)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another Hadith, Hadhrat Abu Hurayra narrates Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) as saying, 'There are no days more beloved to Allah in%0D%0Awhich he is worshipped than the 10 days of Dhul Hijja - the fast of each day%0D%0Ais equivalent to the fast of a year and standing up in worship of the night%0D%0Aof Laylatul Qadr. (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe day of Arafaat should be spent in condition of fasting and involved in%0D%0Athe Dhikr of Allah Ta'ala. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Fasting%0D%0Aon the day of Arafaat is a means of wiping off the previous years as well%0D%0Athe coming year's sins.' Also Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said,%0D%0A'Fasting on the day of Arafaat is equal to fast of 1000 days.'%0D%0A%0D%0AAll days of the Islamic calendar, e.g. Eid, Hajj, etc. should be observed as%0D%0Aper local calendar. The respective days should be observed according to the%0D%0Asighting of the moon in your area.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
