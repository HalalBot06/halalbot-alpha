  "question": "Is it necessary for the people from the bridegroom's side to bear 100% expenses for the walimah after nikah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it necessary for the people from the bridegroom's side to bear 100% expenses for the walimah after nikah or can the expenses be shared by the people from both the bridegroom & the brides's side 50-50.\nI wud appreciate if u can reply soon.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAt the outset it should be understood that Walima does not mean to have an elaborate occasion with an exclusive menu. In time of Nabi (Salalaahu Alayhi Wasallam), Walima occasions were simple. In fact the Walima of Nabi (Salalaahu Alayhi Wasallam) in his marriage to Safiyyah Bint Huyay Radiallahu Anha , he had requested the Sahabah to bring forth their own provisions and lay it on the table as the Walima celebration of Nabi (Salalaahu Alayhi Wasallam). It is unfortunate that due to keeping up with the norms and customs of weddings, families incur huge expenses financial difficulties. Rasulullah (Salalaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, the Nikah with the most amount of Barakah is that Nikah in which the least expense was incurred.\n\nWalima is generally offered from the groomâ€™s side. However, there is no harm if the bride shares in the expenses.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
