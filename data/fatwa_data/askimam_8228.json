  "question": "Is the ghusl (purification) bath still valid if I am wearing an adhesive birth control patch (Ortho Evra)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI'm considering using the Ortho-Evra birth control patch which is and adhesive patch that is removed from the skin every 7 days. Would ghusl be complete if the patch remains on, because that part of the skin would not be exposed to the water, assuming that it was cleansed prior to application? Thanks in advance and Masha'Allah this site is excellent.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf you are using such means of contraception for a valid Shar?ee reason and there will be harm caused to you, i.e. the purpose of the patch will be defeated by removing it before 7 days, then you may make Masah over this patch.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
