  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. I have heard that once you do anal sex, your NIKAH is being terminated instantly with ur wife. Is this true???\n2. During fasting, can a wife sleep topeless with her husband or not\n\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1. It is harām and a major sin for a man to have anal intercourse with one’s wife. Nevertheless, this reprehensible act will not nullify his nikāh.\n\n2. Sleeping topless with one’s husband will not nullify one’s fast. However, modesty demands that she cover herself before sleeping. A person ought to have such an acute consciousness of Allah Ta‘ālā that he or she feels that Allah Ta‘ālā is always watching. With such a mindset, a person ought to feel shy to expose oneself before their Rabb and Cherisher without dire necessity. Disregarding such etiquettes will have negative consequences on a person’s spirituality; thus, paving the way towards other shameless and sinful acts.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Yusuf bin Yaqub,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nConcurred by:\n\nMl. Ehzaz Ajmeri,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nDarul Iftaa"
