  "question": "Women of this world will be more beautiful then the hoors ...no one ever seems to provide the hadith for proof",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPeople always mention this hadith in which it is said that the women of this world will be queen of the hoors & more beautiful & thier husband will love & want them most..but no one ever seems to provide the hadith for proof..it is always just said 'there is this hadith'..So could you please provide it..as i am begining to think it does is not real..Jazak Allah Khair!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn Jannat there are many types of bounties and rewards. Additionally, one should bear in mind that Allah Ta'ala has promised different bounties in Paradise for different categories of people as well as for different deeds. This ayah outwardly addresses the males of this ummah and promises them Hoors in the Hereafter. Consequently, a Muslima will not be adversely affected when her pious husband is endowed with a Hoor. It is explicitly mentioned in the Holy Qura'n that : %0D%0A%0D%0Aa) Allah Ta'ala shall remove from the hearts and minds of the inmates of Paradise any rancour, malice, jealousy or sense of injury. [See 15:47] %0D%0Ab) The Believing wife and children will be joined with their Believing husband%2F father in Paradise. [See 52:21] %0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the above one can safely conclude that a Muslima will not be deprived of her husband's company in paradise. Further it is mentioned in a lengthy Hadith that Rasulullah Sallallaahu-alaihi-wasallam was asked a similar question one day by one of his wives. He consoled her by explaining that the believing woman of this world will be far more beautiful and attractive than the Hoors. This will be due to the excessive ibaadah that they (the woman of this world) had performed.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
