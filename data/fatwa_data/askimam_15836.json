  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs there anything said against performing Nikah in Muharram, with emphasis in the time of saffar? I am to be married on the 17th February which is the 10th day of muharram. Does saffar have any implications or impediments on marriage? jazakAllah Khair.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThere is nothing wrong in marrying in the month of Muharram or in Safr or any time of the year. It was a belief of the time of Jaahiliyyah (pre-Islamic era) that the month of Safr was a bad luck month. Rasulullah corrected this wrong belief and said there is (no bad luck) in Safr.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
