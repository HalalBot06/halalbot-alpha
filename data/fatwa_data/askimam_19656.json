  "question": "Is hypnosis for weight loss purposes permissible?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCould you please clarify whether hypnosis is permissible for weight loss purposes? There are CDs that one can use at home to help with controlling yourself from bingeing, eating sweet/junk foods and to eat healthy meals instead of going for the refined foods.   \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\n \n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\nIf the techniques used in hypnosis do not consist of any elements which are impermissible in Shari’ah then hypnosis will be permissible.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Ali bin Cassim\n\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nLos Angeles, CA (USA)\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
