  "question": "Salaat of a Musafir: What is the definition of Muqaam where a person should start to count the kmâ€™s for Qasr Salaat.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it his house, his street, his suburb, the Metropolitan Phone Code area, Local Council or County Limits? There are no signs for City limits as each Country has their own definition of City, ie. It could be the Central Business District, or it could be the greater suburban area too depending on the context of speech.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person intends to undertake a journey of 48 shari miles or more, he will\nbe a musafir and will have to make qasr (perform 2 rakats in Zuhr, Asr ,\nEsha salaats) after leaving the housing area of his town. However, the\ncalculation of 48 miles will commence from the time of making the intention,\nif it is from ones house, then from there.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
