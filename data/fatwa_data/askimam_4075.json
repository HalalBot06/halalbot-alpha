  "question": "I have seen a compilation of certain selected Ayats from the Qur'an, published in a book titled “Manzil”. Please explain if it's proper to do so.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf so, why these Ayats were the only one's selected, and when and by whom this was done. Some regard this as Bidah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Manzil is compiled by a renowned Muhaddith, Shaykhul Hadith Mawlana\nMuhammad Zakariyyah (RA). Such compilations of Du'aas, etc. have also been\ncompiled by many Ulama in the past, for example, Hizbul A'zam by Mullah Ali\nQari (RA)\n\nThe purpose of such compilations to make available to the general Muslims\neffective Du'aas and Dhikrs for their daily lives. The Qur'aan and Ahaadith\nare replete with orders and encouragements to make Du'aa and Dhikr. The\ncompilation of the Manzil may be used to fulfil this injunction. It is not\nnecessary to read the Manzil, therefore, it is incorrect to state that the\nreading or reciting of the Manzil is Bid'at.\n\nWe wish to advise that the Manzil has proven very effective in removing\nblack magic and evils from one's home. We, therefore, strongly encourage\nreading the Manzil everyday.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
