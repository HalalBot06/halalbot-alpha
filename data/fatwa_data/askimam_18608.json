  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nDoes Allah's all messeges sent on holly prophet(PBUH) are still present in this present times.I am asking about not only quran but all messages also their ahadith which are also the messeges from God.Pls reply.Thanks.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nThere is no doubt that the Qurān has reached us in its pristine purity. This is due to the promise of Allāh where He said,\n\n { إِنَّا نَحْنُ نزلْنَا الذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَافِظُونَ } [سورة الحجر: 9].\n\n“Verily We have revealed the reminder (Qurān) and We are the ones to protect it.” (Surah al-Ḥijr, 9)\n\n \n\nHowever, as for the Aḥādīth, there are many Aḥādīth which have been lost due to the wars which took place in the past. In the book Al-Maslak al-wasaṭ ad-dāni there is a quotation that when the master of Ḥadīth, Allāmah ‘Ibn Ḥajar al-‘Asqalāni (May Allah Ta'ala have mercy on him) was asked regarding those Aḥādīth which scholars in the Ḥanafi and Shāfi’i madhabs use as proof yet there is no sign of them in the books of Ḥadīth, he replied,\n\n“Many of the books of Ḥadīth, in fact most of them have vanished in the Eastern lands during the era of their tribulations. Perhaps these Aḥādīth were in those books and hence, did not reach us.” (Al-Maslak al-wasaṭ ad-dāni (Q 2/Alif, makṭūṭ)\n\nIt is precisely for this reason that we say that it is not possible for any person to become an independent mujtahid in our present times. Perhaps a person might find a narration which he wishes to practise upon, yet there might have been another Ḥadīth which abrogated this narration. Thus, it is best for us to follow such scholars who memorised and went into the depts of over six hundred thousand narrations.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMufti  Ishaq Moosa\nChecked and Approved by:\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
