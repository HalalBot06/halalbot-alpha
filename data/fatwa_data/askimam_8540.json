  "question": "permissibility of reciting duas in the bathroom? where the toilet is adjacent toilet to the sink and ablution is performed in the sink",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn the modern day bathrooms where the toilet is adjacent toilet to the sink and ablution is performed in the sink. Is it permissible to recite the dua?s of wudu?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person forgets to read the Du'aa before entering the toilet, then the Du'aa should be read in one's heart, not on the tongue. However, if the toilet and bathroom are combined, then before entering the actual place of toilet, one may read the Du'aa verbally, on condition one is not unclothed. (Fathul Bari vol.1 pg.197; Daarul Qur'aan).\n\nHowever, it will be best if the Du'aa is read before entering. There is no Du'aa for entering the bathroom before taking a bath. If one enters to relieve himself, then the following Du'aa is recited, 'Allaahumma inniy a'oodhu bika minal khubuth wal khabaa-ith'.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
