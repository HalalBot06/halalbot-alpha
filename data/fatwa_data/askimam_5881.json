  "question": "Sometimes when I sincerely make a Duâ€™aa, or ask Allah for forgiveness, or admire the creation, or when standing up for or during Salaat, I get a chill that runs down my spine and my body shivers.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWould it be possible to explain this phenomenon? It generally happens when I am in seclusion, but for prayer in public as well. The shiver is only for just a few seconds, and I feel it right thru? the length of my spine. This happens when I am thinking about Allah with all my attention, and feel His greatness in my heart. It?s not an everyday thing, but occurs often enough, and lasts for only 2-3 seconds. Alternatively at times, I simply feel a sweet sensation in the upper portion of the spine, and between my shoulders.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe feeling described by you is from Allah. Regard that feeling as an\nhonoured guest from Allah to inspire you.\n\nYou should capitalize on that feeling and make every possible effort to gain\nproximity to Allah by obeying His Orders according to the Sunnah of\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
