Frames having pictures of inanimate objects e.g. trees, mountains,%0D%0Aetc. are permissible.%0D%0A- Hadhrat Abu Talha (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) narrates that Nabi (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'Angels do not enter a house wherein there is a dog%0D%0Aor picture.' (Mishk%E3t vol. 2 p. 385)%0D%0A? %C1bdullah ibn Mas%F3od (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) narrates that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'The people with the most severe%0D%0Apunishment by Allah will be the picture makers.' (Ibid).%0D%0A? Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (RA) narrates, 'I heard the messenger of Allah saying,%0D%0A\"Every picture-maker will be in the fire. A life will be created for every%0D%0Apicture the picture-maker made, and he will be tortured in Hell.\"%0D%0AIf you have to make pictures (says Ibn Abbaas) then make a picture of a tree%0D%0Aor such things which are inanimate.' (Bukhari and Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, if the frames are of inanimate objects but containing verses of the%0D%0ANoble Qur%E3n, Hadith and names of Allah Ta%E3la then extreme caution must be%0D%0Ataken where these frames are hung. If hung at home in the lounge or sitting%0D%0Aroom then due respect should be shown by not using vulgar language or%0D%0Asmoking there.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe advise the photos be destroyed.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
