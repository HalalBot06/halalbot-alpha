  "answer": "QUESTION\nAfter having several miscarriages, I left my job and now I'm at home. Nothing stimulates me anymore, I got into the university course I thought I'd never get into but I didn't even get excited, getting a new job isn't a big deal for me, I'll lie my way through the interview but I won't make an effort to succeed highly. I've lost my motivation and my strength of will. I've been on a emotional rollercoaster since then.Getting up to get exercise or doing housework - it all seems like a chore. I don't want to live sometimes but I continue to pray my salaat. What word of advice can you offer or is there a dua I should read?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe are very sorry to hear of your plight. Allah Ta'ala knows the wisdom of%0D%0Ahis doings, perhaps the children that were to be born could have been a%0D%0Acalamity on you. This was from Allah and we should clearly understand that%0D%0Awe cannot escape the decision of Allah with regard to any matter in our%0D%0Alives.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhatever Allah Ta'ala decides will happen. We have to have faith in Tafweez%0D%0A(resigning oneself to the decision of Allah) and Taqdeer (predestination).%0D%0AThis is the solution to all our anxieities, depression and worries. As the%0D%0Aservants and slaves of Allah, we should understand that our Master will%0D%0Agrant to us only that which is good for us. Our duty and endeavour is that%0D%0Awe supplicate and ask Allah, then make the correct Tadbeer (effort) and%0D%0Athereafter leave the final decision to Allah Ta'ala. This brings peace,%0D%0Acontentment and happiness into one's heart. Our advise is that you should%0D%0Acondition your heart and generate at least to some extent the favour of%0D%0AImaan. Conduct Ta'leem, i.e. read some portion from the famous book of%0D%0A'Fadhaail-e-Aamaal' by Shaykh Zakariyya (RA) everyday and also search for a%0D%0AShaykh (spiritual mentor and guide) with whom one can easily relate and%0D%0Aattempt to acquire from him the love of Allah, the constant consciousness of%0D%0AHis presence and the reality of Tawakkul.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
