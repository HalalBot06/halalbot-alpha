  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have just found out that not pronouncing the arabic alphabets correctly nullifies a salaat. Should I offer my prayers as qadha salaat for the years that I used to pronounce incorrectly.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe statement you make is very general, hence, incorrect. Correct\npronunciation of the Arabic letters is very important, and every Muslim\nshould do his utmost to learn and practice this branch of Deen. But only on\na very few rare occasion will this mispronunciation lead to the Salaat\nbecoming nullified. The Salaat will only be nullified if one is sure that\nsuch a serious and rare error has indeed occurred. Since you are not sure of\nsuch an errorm your Salaat is considered valid and you do not have to repeat\nyour Salaat.\n\nHowever, do make an earnest effort to learn Tajweed (science of\npronunciation).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
