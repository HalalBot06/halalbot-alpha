  "question": "Do I need to make up the prayers between when I first believed in the components of the Shahada and when I said the Shahada in Arabic?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAbout two years ago I first believed in the unity of God and that Mohammad (PBUH) was the messenger of God. I was then separated from good company and Muslims for about a year but never stopped believing. After a year passed I took the Shahada and officially became Muslim. Do I need to make up the prayers for the period of time between when I first believed in the unity of God and that Mohammad (PBUH) was the messenger of God and when I said the Shahada?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, one of the prerequisites to become a Muslim is also Iqraar bil\nlisaan (verbal confession).\n\nAccording to our understanding, previously you believed in the Oneness of\nAllah and finality of the prophethood of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) but did not openly declare that. Your declaration of Islam was one\nyear later and that is when you actually became a Muslim.\n\nIf our understanding is correct, you do not have make Qadhaa of the missed\nSalaats of the past as you were not a Muslim.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
