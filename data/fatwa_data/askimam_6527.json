  "question": "Is it necessary to change place after Farz Namaz in the mosque to read sunnat and nafl?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) If there is no way to go back and anyone read sunnat and naft at same place where he read Farz Namaz then is it permissible? 2) If a person read Namaz in home or as Munfarid (in mosque), is it necessary for him to change place after performing Farz Namaz?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not necessary to change places after the Fardh Salaat in order to\nrecite the Sunan and Nawaafil Salaats. One may recite his Salaat in the same\nposition, however, it is preferable to change position. (Aalamgiri vol.1\npg.113)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
