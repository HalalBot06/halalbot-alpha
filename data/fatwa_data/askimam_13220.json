  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI need assistance in a matter.What is the right of a husband to having sexual interactions with his wife.Aslo what is the wife's duty in this regard.I understand if she has her menstrual cycle it is forbidden but what if she just shunts you for no apparent reason.I don't want to commit adultery but at times it seems like I have no option in this matter.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe purpose of Nikah is also to guard one’s chastity. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Nikah is a means to lower the gaze and guard one’s chastity’. The spouses ought to be sensitive to one another’s intimate feelings. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] also said, ‘When the husband requires his wife to fulfil his passions, she should submit immediately.’\n\nBrother, it is also important to enquire and understand the reason your wife shuns you and do not accede to your request. You should look for the right moment and discuss the issue with her. No responsible woman would just shun her husband for no apparent reason. There must be some reason for her behaviour. She should be given the opportunity to express that to you and you too should give her a fair hearing and consider the issues raised by her. Intimacy is a mutual issue and it is only with the common feelings of the spouses that the marriage and everything relating to the marriage can be successful.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
