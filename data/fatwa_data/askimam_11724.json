  "answer": "QUESTION\nMany timees I had a phsysical relationship with a Girl & was guilty of it, asked for repentence but still I am continuing the same. She is a not a muslim. I thought of Converting her to Islam & marrying her as I had commited the sin & ruined her life(I had not expressed of marrying to her). One day I had seen her with other guy comiting sin, by this I had dropped my intention of marrying her. But still I am meeting her & having the relationship now she had accepted her relationship with the other guy & regretted for that act & asking me to marry her. My family members are not accepting her. I am! in a dilema what to do. Request your kind attention in this regard. Do I marry her? or just forgot her as a past? Pls let me know how to repent for this? I am planning to marry by end of next year as I am feeling that I would be financially sound enough at that time.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou state that when you discovered the girl was having a relationship with another boy and she was unfaithful to you, you decided to leave her. Did you sit back and ponder at least in the light of that principle, ?Allah?s relationship with you as you have been unfaithful to Him by violating His laws and committing adultery?.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf unfaithfulness in a superficial relationship lead to s trained relationship, what do you expect in unfaithfulness between a creation and the Creator? Will the creator not forsake such a creation? We advise you fear Allah and immediately terminate all contact with the girl. If you wish to marry her, make Istikhaara and ask Allah for His guidance. You should be careful in choosing your marriage partner. She should be honest, sincere, devoted and dedicated to you. If the girl was in a habit of having relationship with different people, what if she resumes that after marriage? Be careful and do not hasten.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
