  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamu alaikum Mufti sahib The Sisters in our city want to open a center for exclusive use by women only. They will be able to stay overnight there, learn cooking, seek knowledge, and exercise. Is such a center permissiable or recommended in Islam. A elder brother said that women must be supervised by men and they should not organize themselves. Is this true? This debate is causing alot of fitna in our community. Please advise in light of the sharia with daleel. jazakAllah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn an Aayat of the noble Qur'aan, Allah Ta'ala commands the women, 'And%0D%0Aremain steadfast to your homes and do not expose yourself just as they used%0D%0Ato expose themselves at the time of the first Jaahiliyyah (ignorance).'%0D%0A(Ahzaab Aayat 21)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Shari'ah has placed emphasis on the place of women being indoors.%0D%0AHowever, they are allowed to come outdoors at the time of necessity and this%0D%0Ashould be done with total Purdah and not exposing any of their beauty. The%0D%0Aclause of necessity is restricted to a genuine situation, for example, Hajj%0D%0Aand Umrah, visiting parents, going out to earn a livelihood in an extreme%0D%0Asituation, and in these instances, the woman should be well covered in her%0D%0Aveil, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0AUmm Humayd (Radhiallaahu Anhu), the wife of Abu Humayd Saaidi, came to Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and said, 'O Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam), Verily I love to perform Salaat with you.' Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Verily I know that you love to perform%0D%0ASalaat with me. But your Salaat in your little room is superior to your%0D%0ASalaat in a big room .'. Thus, a room for Salaat was erected for her in the%0D%0Aremotest corner of her house and she remained performing Salaat therein%0D%0Auntil she met Allah (died) (Ahmad)%0D%0A%0D%0AHence, women should try as far as possible to remain indoors as their coming%0D%0Aout is highly discouraged in Shari'ah. The construction of such a centre is%0D%0Aalso not advisable and is fraught with worldly and Deeni dangers.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0Afor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
