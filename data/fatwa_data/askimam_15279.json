  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nRespected Mufti Saheb, A man in our company has become murtad, he was not a practiing muslim and become a murtad (Christian) because of his wife. What action should we take against him and how should we react towards him. It is our family business.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe most appropriate approach would be to befriend him and win his confidence. Islam is about love and care to fellow human beings. First win him over and make him comfortable and close to yourselves. Once that is achieved, by then he would have seen much of Islam. At that stage, speak to him about Islam and remove his misconceptions about Islam. The brother could be referred to an Aalim who specialises in the field of dawah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
