  "question": "What level of bleeding will break wudhu? What is meant exactly by \"flowing\" blood and will it break wudhu?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease could you explain what level of bleeding will break wudhu? ie What is meant exactly by \"flowing\" blood ie Will the blood which spreads just outside the wound be considered flowing and therefore break the wudhu or will the blood need to flow more profusely beyond the immediate area of the wound?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf the blood spreads beyond the wound, it is flowing blood which invalidates Wudhu.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
