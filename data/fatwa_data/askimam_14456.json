  "question": "Does your wudhu break if you fall asleep in a airplane while seated?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDoes your wudhu break if you fall asleep in a airplane while seated?\n\n[1] A hanafi scholar mentioned that wudhu does not break if your rear is firmly seated while you are asleep. I would like to ask you if wudhu does not break if you sleep while sitting firmly on the seat in an airplane?\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nSleep itself does not invalidate Wudhu. Passing wind invalidates Wudhu. When a person is asleep, he does not know if he has passed wind or not, therefore, a full sleep is regarded as a measure. If a person is not fully asleep and he is aware of his condition, for example, if he passed wind, he would be aware of that, then such a sleep does not invalidate the Wudhu.\n\nThe Fuqahaa (jurists) have explained some signs of half sleep or such conditions that indicate that the person is not fully asleep. Generally, if a person is sitting as in the aeroplane, he is not fully asleep and he is aware of his condition. However, it is also possible for a person to fall into a deep sleep and not be aware of his condition while sitting in the aeroplane. Therefore, the decision will rest upon the individual himself. If he feels he did not sleep fully, his Wudhu will be intact. If he feels he had a full sleep while sitting in the aeroplane, his Wudhu will be invalidated.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
