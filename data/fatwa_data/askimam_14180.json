  "question": "many great imams have written in their books that Nabi SAW is haazir and naazir.your comments plz",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nis the following not proof that the Prophet is haazir and naazir? Imaam Ghazali (RA), the seal of Islam, a great scholar and a Sufi Master writes, \"When you go into a mosque then say salaam to the Holy Prophet (Sallal Laahu Alaihi Wasallam) because the Holy Prophet (Sallal Laahu Alaihi Wasallam) is present (Haazir) in mosques.\" (Mirqat - Shareh Miskat)\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nHaazir means to be present. Naazir means to see.\n\nSome people have a misconception that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] is present everywhere and sees everything everywhere. The qualities of Omnipresence and Omnipotent belongs only to Allah. No human being including any Prophet is Omnipotent and/or Omnipresent. Whosoever has such a belief has committed Kufr. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] is certainly Haazir at his Rawza (place of resting). That does not mean he is Haazir (present) everywhere.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
