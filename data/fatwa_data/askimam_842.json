  "question": "Is Interest prohibited between a Muslim and non-Muslim in Darul-Harb (non-Islamic state) like South Africa, UK, Australia, etc.?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMufti Khadem Islam gives fatwa that buying mortgage house in UK is allowed because UK is a kaafir land.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the overwhelming majority of the Muslim Jurists, there is no\ndifference in the prohibition of interest between a Muslim and non-Muslim\nanywhere, Darul Islam (Islamic state) or Darul Harb (a state of ongoing\nconflict with Muslims).\nIn the early days of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) many Muslims\nused to enter into Riba transactions with non-Muslims, but when Riba was\nprohibited, they stopped this practice totally. The Aayats of the Noble Qur'\nan which prohibited Riba did not differentiate between a Muslim and\nnon-Muslim. Similarly, there is no example in the days of the Sahaaba (RA)\nwhere anyone of the Sahaaba (RA) entered into Riba transaction with a\nnon-Muslim after the prohibition was enforced. Therefore, one cannot be\nadvised to take an interest-bearing loan, even in a non-Muslim country.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
