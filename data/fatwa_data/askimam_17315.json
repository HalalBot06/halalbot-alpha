  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThere are two fatwas that has been issued, one regarding the material of socks and the other regarding it containing holes. Kindly please answer on the right understanding of the subject with ample explanation and evidence.\n\nWhat is nature of socks during wipening.? Can a person wipe on any socks or it must be leather. Give the answer in light of Quran and Hadith?\n\nPraise be to Allaah.\nIt was narrated that al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did wudoo’ and wiped over his socks and shoes.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 92; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 86)\n\nThe author of al-Qaamoos said: jawrab (socks) means something that is wrapped around the feet.\n\nAbu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi said: jawrab means a thin cover for the feet made of wool, worn to keep the feet warm.\n\nIt was narrated that Yahyaa al-Bakka’ said: I heard Ibn ‘Umar saying, “Wiping over the socks (jawrabayn) is like wiping over the leather slippers (khuffayn).”\n\nAl-Musannaf by Ibn Abi Shaybah, 1/173\n\nIbn Hazm said: wiping over anything that is worn on the feet – of things that are permitted to be worn and which come up above the ankles – is Sunnah, whether they are slippers (khuffayn) made of leather or felt or wood, or socks made of linen, wool, cotton, camel hair or goat hair, whether leather is worn over them or not, or whether they are overshoes or slippers worn over slippers or socks worn over socks.\n\nAl-Muhalla, 1/321\n\nSome scholars differed as to whether it is permissible to wipe over the slippers (khuffaayn). The correct view as indicated by the evidence is that it is permissible to do that, as stated above.\n\nAnd Allaah knows best.\n\nSee the answer to Question No. 8186 and 9640\n\n\nIslam Q&A\nSheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajj\n\nIs it permissible to wipe over socks that have holes in them [when making wudoo’]?\n\nPraise be to Allaah. \n\nThe correct view is that it is permissible to wipe over khuff (leather slippers which cover the foot and ankle) or socks that have holes in them. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) allowed wiping over khuff and he did not stipulate any condition that they should be whole and free of holes or tears, especially since the khuff of his companions were not free of holes or tears. If this had any effect on whether one could wipe over them, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have stated that clearly, for one of the basic principles of usool al-fiqh is that it is not permitted to delay explaining something when it is needed.\n\nImaam Sufyaan al-Thawri (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “One may wipe over the khuff so long as it is still clinging to the feet. Were the khuff of the Muhaajireen and Ansaar anything but full of holes and tears?” (Narrated by ‘Abd al-Razzaaq in al-Musanaaf, 1/194)\n\nShaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Fataawa (21/174): When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave the command to wipe over the khuff, he knew what the normal state of affairs was, and he did not stipulate the condition that the socks should be whole and free of any faults. His command should be taken as general in meaning and it should not be restricted unless there is any shar’i evidence for doing so. What is implied by the wording is that any khuff that people wear and walk about in may be wiped over, even if they have holes or are worn out, without defining the acceptable extent for these holes and tears, because even such a definition would require evidence…” \n\nThis is also the view of Ishaaq, Ibn al-Mubaarak, Ibn ‘Uyaynah and Abu Thawr.\n\n Imaam al-Shaafa'i and Ahmad – according to the well-known views narrated from them – said that it is not permissible to wipe over the khuff or socks so long as there are any holes or tears in the place where it is obligatory to do wudoo’. Abu Haneefah and Maalik differentiated between small holes and large holes. \n\nBut the correct view is the first view quoted above, which is that it is permissible to wipe over the khuff or socks so long as they are still clinging to the feet and it is still possible to walk in them. \n\nIt is also correct to wipe over socks through which the skin can be seen, because the permission to wipe over socks is general and no report of any restriction has been narrated. This implies that any socks which people wear may be wiped over. This is what is implied by those who say that it is permissible to wipe over khuff that are worn out, so long as it is still possible to walk in them. \n\nAl-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) mentioned in al-Majmoo’ (1/502) that even if a person were to wear khuff made of glass, if it were possible to walk in them then it would be permissible to wipe over them, even though the skin beneath them would be visible… \n\nAnd Allaah knows best. \n\nShaykh Sulaymaan ibn Naasir al-‘Alwaan\n\nMay Allah (SWT) use you more, to be the means of guidance! Ameen!\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nMoulana Ismail Moosa (Sallamahu) has completed his first year Mufti course at the Darul ifta.\n\nThere is still much confusion on the issue of masah on socks, especially in America, Canada, UK, and the Middle East countries where masah is made on regular cotton or nylon socks.\n\nThis is of particular concern to people performing Salah behind Imams who make masah on regular cotton or nylon socks. The Darul Iftaa regularly receives queries in this regard. Amongst other queries are the following:\n\n1.      Is the Imams wudhu valid?\n\n2.      Is the follower’s wudhu valid?\n\n3.      Should we perform our own Salah etc.?\n\nRecently, a new sock, SealSkinz has come into the market and the position of wiping on that is being queried. Alhamdulillah, Moulana Ismail Moosa (Sallamahu) in this document has discussed the issue in much detail. He also proves the impermisibility of masah on regular cotton socks. He concludes that masah on SealSkinz is permissible.\n\nThis treatise should be presented to Imams and trustees of the Masaajid. The issue of masah on regular socks MUST be considered before appointing a person as an Imam of the Masjid.\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n(Mufti) Ebrahim Desai Saheb   \n\nClick Here"
