  "question": "Does cutting your nails break the Wudhu?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1.) When you perform wudhū, unclothed and before taking a shower is that wudhū still valid?\n\n2.) If I take a shower without performing wudhū and water reaches all the areas where wudhū needs to be made, does it count as wudhū?\n\n3.) Does cutting your nails break wudhū?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n1.) Yes, the wudhū that is performed while taking a shower is valid and you do not need to perform another wudhū as long as your wudhū does not break. The 'awrah being exposed due to taking a shower does not invalidate the wudhū. It is Sunnah to perform wudhū while performing ghusl.[i]\n\n2.) Yes, if water reaches all the areas where wudhū is fardh then your wudhū is valid even if you did not intend to perform wudhū and all acts of worship that require wudhū can be carried out. However one will not get the reward for performing wudhū if an intention was not made.[ii]\n\n3.) No, cutting your nails does not break wudhū. However, if the nails are so long that they cover the top of the fingertips then one should make sure that water reaches below the nails otherwise the wudhū will not be valid. Fingernails should be regularly trimmed and it is mustahab (recommended) to do so every Friday.[iii]\n\n \nAnd Allāh knows best.\n \nMl.
