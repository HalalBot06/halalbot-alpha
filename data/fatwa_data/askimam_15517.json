  "question": "Can we distribute Zakaat funds without the donor knowing where it goes?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThe zakath, sadakka, Mian etc. collected from a person for a poor person or an institution or a mosque or madrasa or for a club for social welfare etc.  If the money is so big in terms of their currency, is it possible that we can  re- distribute this money among various poor needy persons or others without the knowledge of the Zakath payer. \n\nI mean a person is sick...my boss gives more money when I reported this matter.   I can give some  money to him and some to other sick, poor and needy out of the money given by my boss....because I cannot always go to my boss and tell him each and every case ....\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nYour question is not clear. According to our understanding of your query, your boss gives you money to distribute to a particular organization or poor people. You are faced with a situation where the money is too much for that organization or poor people. Your query is could you give the money to another needy avenue without the consent of your boss. If our understanding of your query is correct, then the answer is no. You are the wakeel (representative) of your boss. You will have to follow his instructions. As an alternative, explain to him your predicament and suggest to him to grant you the power to distribute the funds according to your discretion. If he gives you that power, then it will be permissible for you to distribute the funds as you deem fit.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
