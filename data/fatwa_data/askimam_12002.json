  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like to know what is the origin of the half-moon figure that we can often see on our mosques. Some muslim countries have it on their flags. I dont think it existed in Muhamaad's SAW time. I know it (moon and star) represents islam but in which way and how did it all start? Salaam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe moon and star representing Islam have no official basis in Shari?ah.\n\nHowever, many aspects of Islam, the commencing of the Islamic year and the commencing of every month, is dependant on the sighting and setting of the moon. There are also some Islamic occasions that have taken place during specific days of the lunar month, for example, 10 of Muharram, 15 Sha?baan, 27 Rajab, etc. These incidents have many Islamic connotations and are calculated according to the lunar calendar. The Qur?aan also refer to the Crescent as a means of calculating time for people and for Hajj.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
