  "question": "Is there a Hadith that supports making any Du’aa in Arabic while in Sajda during Salaat (in addition to reciting “Subhana Rabbi’al Aala”)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf one does not know Arabic, can he use any other language?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are other Du'aas mentioned in the Ahaadith. These may be recited in\nNafl Salaats. As for Fardh, Waajib and Sunnah Salaats, it is best to confine\noneself to, 'Subhaana Rabbial a-alaa.'\n\nIn Salaat, one may only make Du'aa in Arabic. Out of Salaat, one may make Du\n'aa in any language.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
