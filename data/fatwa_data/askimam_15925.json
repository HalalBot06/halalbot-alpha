  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf I have just finished my salaat, arisen and walked a few steps and then suspected I didn't do the salaat correctly, can I return to do the prostrations of forgetfulness? Or do I need to repeat the entire salaat?\n\nThis happened at Asr and I did the prostrations of forgetfulness. Now after Isha, I have also repeated the Asr salaat as Qada.\n\nBut I don't actually know the correct answer either way. I would like to know for both present and future guidance.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram / Muhtaramah ,\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf you did not speak, eat, drink or move your chest away from the qiblah, you may go back and perform the sujood of forgetfulness.  (Raddul Muhtaar vol. 2 pg. 558)  It will be necessary to repeat the namaaz if one missed a fardh act.  If one misses any of the wajib acts unknowingly, this mistake can be compensated by performing sajda sahw. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai (F1)\nDarul Iftaa"
