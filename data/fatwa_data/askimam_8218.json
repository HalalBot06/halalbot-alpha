It is also permissible to lie in a joking manner wherein the opposite person is not being deceived and misled, or in order to encourage a person, like one?s wife and children.

However, if you are not a Ma?zoor, but your Wudhu does not stay for long after Fardh Salaat, then you should repeat your Wudhu and perform your Sunnah. You will not gain reward by merely making intention.%0D%0A%0D%0A3.
