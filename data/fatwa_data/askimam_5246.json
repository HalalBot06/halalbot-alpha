  "question": "Mufty Sahab, please tell us about the Salat-u-salam that people read before or after the Azan. If it is permissible then what is the proper way of doing so.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have to ask you about the Salat-u-Salam (Daru-e-pak) specifically,\"Assalat-u-assalam-u-Allaka yaa Rassullallah, Wasallam Allaka yaa Rassullallah/ Khabiballah\" before or after the Azan (for five times prayers). Some people say that it is totally wrong because its \"Bidhat\" but other say that there is no harm rather it's swab in doing so. Please help us in this regard in the light of Quran-u-Hadith. If it is permissble to do so then please tell us the right way of doing so. jazakallah. Shafiq-ur-Rehman\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe Adhaan has been a practice from the blessed era of Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). The saying of Durood and salaam before Adhaan\nis a newly invented innovation (Bid’at) which started recently. If this\npractice of Durood had been part of Deen, then surely Nabi (Sallallaahu\nAlayhi Wasallam) would have informed the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum), which\nin turn they should practice the Taabi’een and our pious predecessors. By\nthem not practicing is evident that it was not from the teachings of the\nholy prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), hence, an innovation (Bid’at).\n\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ‘Whosoever initiates a new action\nin our Deen, it is rejected.’ (Mishkaat). Our objective is to earn the\npleasure of Allah Ta’ala which only comes when one practices upon what was\nbrought by Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nHowever, Shari’ah has encouraged to recite Durood after Adhaan (softly)\nfollowed by the Du’aa after the Adhaan (Aap ke masaail vol.2 pg.162)\n\nand Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
