  "question": "Respected Imam sahib, I know that itâ€™s prohibited in Islam to trim hair for women but I like my wife in short hair, is it permissible. Jazakalllah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBrother, you are correct that it is prohibited for a female to cut or trim\nher hair. An exemption to a prohibited act is granted only in specific\nsituations. Your reason does not qualify for that exemption.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
