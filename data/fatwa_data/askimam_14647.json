  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy immidiate seniour in office acts like a hypocrite. Acts to be a normal muslim by using islamic terms like \"mashallah\" Alhumdulillah\" etc. but when talking with individuals about islam he negates everything like an ethiest and sometimes infornt of some of his collegues but not infront of his seniours where he thinks that the matter can become serious, he critisezes islam, speaks rubbish but changes his views according to the person next to him, he takes out such points to which the answer is not known commonly to everyone and he do this just to confuse them specially in a gathering of some collegues n specially when i m among them, just to make me angry n irritate, when asked to go to an alim with me for ur queries, then he has no time. You cant imagine that situation although hes my senior but even then i have strictly warned him that not to bark rubbish,i m very much hurt n its very hard for me to coperate with him in office work. i keep only the intention of 'Dawah' while working with him. I dont greet him by 'Assalamualaikum' or 'Allah hafiz'. i hate his kufar but have sympathy for hes a humanbeing and pray for his hidayat. sometimes i get v much hurt n confused! kindly suggest.\n\nP.S : Atleast you should give 1 minute when the session opens to enter in it. i am try to ask this question since a week and whenever it opens and i am refreshing my page again and again and when the exact time comes, it again passes over n the time for the next session starts. Man!!! its really hard to reach your pannel.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nYour sympathetic feeling towards your senior is a reflection of your good heart. Your senior is a Muslim. You should greet him with Salam. Win him over with your humbleness and kind gestures. You should control your negative feelings towards him. It is highly possible that your negative feelings due to his wrongs may trespass the boundary of moderation and you may start following your Nafs. Now your anger will not be directed to his wrongs. It will be dictated by your Nafs. If you are honest and sincere in changing and reforming your senior, check your intention regularly and also make Dua for him to change. If you are humble and kind to him he will be attracted to you and will change Inshallah. You will be greatly rewarded for that.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
