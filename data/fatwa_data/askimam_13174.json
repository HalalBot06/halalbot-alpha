  "question": "British repossessed our land in india",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy grand father and father during the government of British in Subcontinent were living in the India and we were called as the lords over there, we had alot of lands and assets there but during the partition we were forced by the English people to leave those lands and house and to move to pakistan without getting any money for it, tell me is it allowed for me to get the loan or anything from here in Uk and don\\'t return it back to them and come back to my country.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn principle, when the Kuffaar conquer a land and take full control of it, they will be considered the owners of that land. Therefore, even though their appropriation of your land was illegal, you do not have the right to illegally extort money from them. (Hidaaya vol.1 pg.581)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
