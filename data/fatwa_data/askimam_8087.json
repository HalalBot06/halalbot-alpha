  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamu Alaikum, I often see in my dream that my teeth are breaking at a very fast speed, sometimes I get this feeling that all have broken. Since this has happened several times, I want to know what this means. 2) Many ghair Muqallids(or salfis,as they call themselves) make senseless criticism on Ai'nal Hidaya(a Hanafi book). To which extent are they correct in doing so? 3) May I know a book in which the Hanafi Saluaat is described in detail with strong dala'il and is easy to Understand by common person(Except Bahishti Zewar)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. May Allah Ta?ala grant you long life.\n\n2. The book Ainul Hidaaya is a reliable book with many rulings from different Fiqhi sources. There is no remedy to ignorant people making criticism. Ignore them with diplomacy as advised by Allah Ta?ala in the Qur?aan.\n\n3. Kindly refer to ?Salaat According to the Hanafi Madhab? by Shaykh Abu Yusuf Riyaadh-ul-Haqq and ?Is Your Salaat Correct?? by Shaykh Fadhlur-Rahmaan Saheb\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
