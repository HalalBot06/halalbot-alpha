  "question": "how can just talking to someone of the opposite sex be regarded as adultery?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow can this be regarded as adultery if you dont see them, talk about haram things or are tempted to meet them and do haram?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf there is no need to talk to the opposite gender who are non-Mahrams (not prohibited in marriage), then that is a sin.\n\nShari?ah strongly advocates separation and segregation of sexes. The evils of intermingling of sexes and free communication between them are well known. In brief, it is death to a pure and clean heart and mind. It is death to spirituality.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
