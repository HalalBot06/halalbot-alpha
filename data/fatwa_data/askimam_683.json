  "question": "Does eating cooked food nullify one's wudu?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am referring to the Hadith which says: Anything touched by fire voids wudu. If not then how do you explain this and many other hadiths which show that this is the case?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the majority school of thoughts (Madhaahib), anything prepared by fire does not nullify Wudhu based on many other Ahaadith wherein it is sated that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) ate cooked meat and performed Salaat without repeating his Wudhu.\n\nAmong other answers given by the Muhadditheen for the Hadith referred by you, one is, it refers to the literal Wudhu which means rinsing the mouth.\nAfter eating meat, for example, one should rinse his mouth. Another answer is that the Hadith has been abrogated. However, since Imaam Ahmad is of the view that the Wudhu breaks, it is Mustahabb to renew one's Wudhu after eating cooked food.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
