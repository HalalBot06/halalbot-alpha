  "question": "Is Salaah valid with a spot of lime on the skin?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nCalcium hydroxide (slaked lime) and betel-nut are eaten with betel leaves. Somebody took his obligatory bath and prayed both fajr and ishraq salaats. After ishraq he noticed a small spot of lime on one of his fingers which appeared as a remnant of his last night’s betel leaf eating. What should he do for his salaats already prayed?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf the spot of lime was a mere coloring on the skin and not a layer on the skin, then the salah will be valid.\n\n  \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai \n\nDarul Iftaa"
