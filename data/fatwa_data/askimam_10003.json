  "question": "My daughter was born out of wedlock. Can she nullify my wudu?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have read that our Prophet (PBUH)kissed his wife before he made salaah. Is this true? Can my wife nullify my wudu? Does it depend on the circumstance or intention eg. if I accidentally touch her hand in passing\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Shafi'i madhhab does not consider a daughter bon out of wedlock as mahram. As such touching her will nullify the wudu.\n\nThe authenticity of the hadith mentioned has been called into question by a number of major hadith critics. It is a matter upon which the 'ulama differ.\n\nTouching your wife can nullify your wudu. This does not depend on the circumstances or the intention. Even touching accidentally will nullify the wudu.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nShaykh Taha Karaan\nDARUL ULOOM AL-ARABIYYAH AL-ISLAAMIYYAH, Western Cape (SA)\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
