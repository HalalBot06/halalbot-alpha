  "question": "A person is effected with Sihr/Magic and in such condition gives Talaq. Does the Talaq occur?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nA person is effected with sehar (magic) and his body is possessed by a jin (devil) and his mental capabilities are not proper or normal as normal people. He is under spiritual treatment.\n\nHe divorced his wife a few years ago for the first time and then they lived together. After a year, on the phone he said divorce for the second time while his wife did not hear it and again they lived together. Then after a year he said divorce for the third time while texting his wife when she asked to be separated. He said, “You consider it to be Talāq”? Then, on the same day they got into a fight and he said Talāq for the fourth time.\n\nThis person did not know that it will separate his wife from him. He thought Rujū (taking the wife back) cancels the utterance of Talāq. Now the husband and the wife want to live together.\n\nKindly tell us what Shari’āh says regarding this matter since some of the ulamā have said that in this condition, the Talāq of such a person is not valid.\n\n\n \nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. \n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nIn principal, giving three Talāqs constitutes a Talāq Al-Mughalladhah (an irrevocable Talāq). Regarding an insane person, there are two types of situations:\n\n \n\n1.      Majnoon (insane)\n\n2.      Mā’tūh (mental instability), which means that at times he is insane and at times he is sane.\n\n \n\nThe ruling for the second type of a person (Mā’tūh) is that, if he utters the words of Talāq in the state of insanity, the Talāq will not take place. If he utters the words of Talāq in the state of sanity, it will constitute a Talāq.[i]\n\nAccording to what you have mentioned in your query, it seems like this person is a Mā’tūh. You have stated that this person did not know that giving Talāq will separate him from his wife. This clearly shows that, at the time of uttering the words of Talāq, he was aware of what he was saying. You have also stated that he thought Rujū (taking the wife back) cancels the Talāq.[ii] This also proves that he was sane since he constantly uttered the words of Talāq thinking that Rujū will cancel the Talāq. Ignorance is not an excuse in Shari’āh.\n\nFurthermore, texting the words of “Talāq” to his wife also prove that he was sane at the time of texting since an insane person does not have the ability to go to the text option and precisely type the words of Talāq.\n\nIn your case, Talāq Al-Mughalladhah (an irrevocable Talāq) of this person has clearly taken place which means that after the third Talāq, his wife had become Al-Mughalladhah and she was no longer his wife. Hence, it is not permissible for him to marry her until she marries someone else and the marriage has been consummated. Only then it will be permissible for him to marry her.\n\n\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Abdul Hannan Nizami,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\nUSA\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Husain Kadodia.\nwww.daruliftaa.net\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[i]  الفتاوى الهندية (1/ 353) مكتبه رشيديه\n\nوَكَذَلِكَ الْمَعْتُوهُ لَا يَقَعُ طَلَاقُهُ أَيْضًا وَهَذَا إذَا كَانَ فِي حَالَةِ الْعَتَهِ أَمَّا فِي حَالَةِ الْإِفَاقَةِ فَالصَّحِيحُ أَنَّهُ وَاقِعٌ هَكَذَا فِي الْجَوْهَرَةِ النَّيِّرَةِ.\n\n \n\nفتاوي دار العلوم ديوبند (10/149) مكتبة العلم\n\n \n\n [ii] سنن أبي داود (2/ 259)\n\nعَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ قَالَ: \" ثَلَاثٌ جَدُّهُنَّ جَدٌّ، وَهَزْلُهُنَّ جَدٌّ: النِّكَاحُ، وَالطَّلَاقُ، وَالرَّجْعَةُ \""
