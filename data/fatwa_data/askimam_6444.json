  "question": "If the Imam makes a mistake in the qiraat of the salaah and three ayats were not recited nor was one long ayat recited, should the salaah be repeated or does sajda-e-sawh rectify the mistake?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe assume that Surah Fatiha was recited.\n\nIf Sajdah-e-Sahw was made, the Salaat is valid. If Sajdah-e-Sahw was not\nmade, and the time of that Salaat has not expired, it should be repeated. If\nthe time has expired, then should make Tawbah and Istighfaar. In that the\nSalaat does not have to be repeated.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
