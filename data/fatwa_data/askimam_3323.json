  "question": "Is it permissable to eat in restaurants that serve alcohol? Also can we eat food that is prepared by non Muslims?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTayyibaat refers to that food which is pure (Halaal) beyond doubt.\nTherefore, precaution should be exercised in determining which food is\nHalaal beyond doubt. It is not sufficient to rely on the Halaal signs\nadvertised on windows of food outlets as many people use the sign only for\ncommercial purposes.\n\nFood prepared by non-Muslims or served in a restaurant serving alcohol is\nnot Tayyibaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
