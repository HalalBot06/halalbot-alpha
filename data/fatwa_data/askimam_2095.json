  "question": "My boyfriend and I will be getting married soon. He confessed to me that he had an affair with his step mother while living in his fathers house.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am in love with him and we've been through a lot together. His family have refused to accept me on the basis of rumours and slander from other people, none of which is true. Now they seem to be coming around and he's confessed this. I am so confused about where I stand and what our marriage will mean and how am I to treat his step mother and father? No one else knows about this. We are both born Muslims.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, when a person commits adultery, the\nascendants and descendants of both adulterers become prohibited upon one\nanother.\n\nIn view of the abovementioned principle, your 'boy friends' father and his\nwife are prohibited upon one another. Obviously, the above will have serious\nimplications on your proposed marriage. We therefore suggest you discuss the\nmatter further before committing to marriage.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
