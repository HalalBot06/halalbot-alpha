  "question": "Can we bring IMAAN on Youmal-Akhar. (b) If somebody gave me some amount of money to be given to a fakir and I could not find that person, in this case,",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n(a) Can we bring IMAAN on Youmal-Akhar. (b) If somebody gave me some amount of money to be given to a fakir and I could not find that person, in this case what I have to do. Whether I need to return the money back to the person or what I have to do with this money. (c) During Nikah time, is it enough for the bride and groom only to say the KABUL (acceptance) word 3 times, or any duas or some other words/verses apart from this to be read/recited ? Thankyou...\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We assume that by ?Youmul Akhar?, you mean ?the day of Qiyaamat?. A person will have to bring Imaan in his lifetime. After his death, his Imaan will be of no benefit. To believe on the last day is an integral part of our faith.\n\n2. You should find out what the person?s intention was, i.e. if he wanted to give it only to a specific Fakir, then if you an?t find that Fakir (poor person), you should inform that person. If that person wanted you to give it to any Fakir, but he just mentioned a specific person by the way, then you may give it to any other poor person.\n\n3. Saying the Qubool by the groom or wife will be sufficient for the Nikah to be complete. However, there are Du?aas that can be recited for blessing, e.g. Baarakallaahu lakumaa wa Baaraka alaykumaa wa Jama-a baynakimaa fiy khayr.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
