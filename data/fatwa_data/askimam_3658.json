  "answer": "QUESTION\n- Would you please the describe the process of tawassul? - Also, what do you think of Dr. Taha Jabir Al-Alwani book ?Usul Al Fiqh Al Islami? If you have not read this book, the link to access this book online is written below: www.islamicweb.com/beliefs/fiqh/alalwani_usulalfiqh/ - Must one have wudu in order to do dhikr? - Who were Ibrahim Al-Nakhai, Hammad ibn Abi Suleiman, and Alqamah (RA)?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Tawassul (to seek a medium) is proven from Qur'an and Hadith. Allah\nTa'ala says, 'O you who believe! Fear Allah and seek Waseela to Him.'\nHadhrat Umar (Radhiallaahu Ánhu) sought rain during drought through the\nWaseela of the Prophet's Uncle. However, due to people trespassing the\nlimits of Waseela and there is fear of committing Shirk, it is advisable to\nabstain from Tawassul. Any permissible act which may lead to Shirk also\nbecomes prohibited.\n2. Kindly explain which aspect you would like us to comment on.\n3. Dhikr can be made without Wudhu.\n4. Hammad ibn Abi Sulaiman - student of Ibrahim al-Nakhai; Ibrahim, a\nstudent of Alqamah; Alqamah, a student of Hadhrat Abdullah ibn Mas'ood\n(Radhiallaahu Anhu).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
