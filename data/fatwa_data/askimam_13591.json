  "question": "Hitherto the Ulama of Indo-Pak have always vehemently refuted the permissibility of shaving or trimming the beard They did not and do not consign any credence to the opposite view",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n(1)  In your Fatwa No.13473 dated September 16th 2005, you had mentioned: “It will not be correct to label those who do not keep a beard in the light of this research as Faasiq..”   What really is the agenda for mentioning the view of the modernists? I have understood from this that this is the view of only the modernist Ulama whom you have described as “the present day Ulama”. I am of the opinion that it is incorrect to attribute this view to “present day Ulama” in view of the confusion it can create. Since you too are among the “present day Ulama”, will I be correct to conclude that you too are of this view?\n\n(2)  Your reply is quiet ambiguous. Hitherto the Ulama of Indo-Pak have always  vehemently refuted the permissibility of shaving or trimming the beard They did not and do not consign any credence to the opposite view. However, the manner in which you have answered the question gives one the impression that you do regard the beard-shaving view as a valid view. Please remove this ambiguity by clarifying whether the view of the modernist Ulama is a valid view.\n\n(3)  What is the fatwa of your institution on the practice of shaving the beard? Is such a person a faasiq or not?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf you clearly read our answer to Q,13471, you will realise that we clearly said that the research of our 'Ulama is that the beard is wajib.\n\nHowever, as the questioner was asking about performing salah behind Somali Shafi Imams, we mentioned that it would not be correct to classify them as Faasiq, as according to them trimming the beard is mukruh and not haram.\n\nWe never said that we agreed with them, all we said is that as they have their proofs for what they are saying and it is the viewpoint of some ulama, thus for us to classify them as faasiq would not be correct.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Husain Kadodia\nFATWA DEPT"
