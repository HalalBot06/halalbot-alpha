  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy husband is quite islamic, he tries to be better when i tell him to, but he is very arrogant, he says...he can PROUDLY stand in fron of Allah and say he tried his best to live an islamic life. We all have mistake. But is it permissible to have this PROUDNESS in terms of standing in front of Allah in the here after? Arent we muslims, supposed to be more HUMBLE no matter waht good we have done for teh sake of islam. If so, how can i help to bring this humbleness in my husbands heart so there isnt any proudness...Because if i tell him you are being proud he wouldnt understand that this is in fact a kind of proudness, he would rather be upset with me...please advice\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt seems the more you are going to advise him to adopt humility, the more his anger will prompt him to be defensive, which you perhaps interpret as “proudness”. Instead of putting him on the defensive in such a situation, rather ignore him if you feel he is acting proud. Talk to him about humility when he is in a good mood.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
