  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamaliakum mufti sahib, When reading salat what does one read after durood shrief. I have heard that you read something like rabbey jellney, or something similar. If so, can you please tell me all of the full verse when you reply and if not, what do you read. Can you only read up to durood shrief and then do salaam? Please explain according to Hanafi Mathab. Jazakallah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAfter reciting Durood Sharief in Salaat, you can read any Du'aa from the Qur\n'aan or Hadith. Any Du'aa that resembles the speech of people, e.g. 'O\nAllah! get me married' will not be permissible.\n\nThere are some specific Du'aas mentioned in the Hadith, 'Allaahumma inniy\ndhalamtu nafsiy dhulman katheeran wa innahoo laa yaghfirud dhunooba illaa\nanta fa-ghfirliy maghfiratan min indika warhamniy innaka antal ghafoorur\nraheem.\n\nTo recite these Du'aas after Durood Shareef is Sunnat. Salaam may be made\nimmediately after Durood.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
