  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAsalamu 'alaikum dear respected brother.\n\nI am deeply troubled by a huge deal of guilt that i carry around with me. I read my 5time namaaz and constantly make zikr every night without fail and read absolutely everything i can to please Allah and myself. My problem is that at 20years of age, i have been indulging in the most heinous and grievious sin of adultery for the past year with whom i am proposed. I feel tremendous guilt and remorse for this evil sin and constantly cry out for mercy and forgiveness when sitting on the musallah or reading the Quraan. Inevitably i commit the same sin again and continue to do so today because of the weakness to resist this evil doing. everytime i commit this sin i feel ashamed to even ask for forgiveness but ask anyway. I am so terribly afraid that i will not be forgiven and that i will be granted Jahanam. I need to know if there is any hope for me and if you could please suggest a supplication or anything i can read to fullfil my intention of never recommiting this maistake and for the strength to resist temptation and slso fofr Allah's mercy for the wrong that i have done..\n\nJazakumullah..\n\nSister.. \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nDARUL   IFTAA  NOTICE  FOR HOLIDAYS\n\nPlease be advised that Darul Iftaa Office will be closing for the Semester Holidays from 4th April 2009 until 14th April 2009.
