  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. I got email from external mail list telling staying awake and doing ibbadath (Pray) on Sheb-e-barat night and fasting next day is bidah is it true. 2. Also it has said that on Lailatul Meraj night it is not necessary to stay awake and do ibbadath because no one know if that is the exact night when Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu √Ålayhi Wasallam) went to Meraj and it will be bidah to do ibbadath on those nights Is it true. Please explain us clearly if it is bidah or not if we do ibbadath on these 2 nights, if it?s not then what will be the reward if we pray whole night and kept fast next day..\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are differences of opinion regarding the actual date of Shab?e Mi?raaj. Furthermore, there is no specific Ibaadat to be performed on this night. To regard any specific Ibaadat on this night will be Bid?at.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
