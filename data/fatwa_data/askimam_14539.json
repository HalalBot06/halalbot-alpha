  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy father passed away last month. People around us asking us to perform Chehlum after 40 days and Barsi every year.  It sounds like BIDAH to me. Would you please let us know the right thing in the light of Quran and Hadith. But, AlhumduliAllah we are taking care of spending money in the name of Allah to the needy especially in Madarsas (for Sawab-e-Jaria). Please let us know what are the things we shoud do.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAll praise is to Allah for making us from the Ummah of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. We are blessed to belong to the Deen of Islam. A Deen which is simple and easy. A Deen neither extreme nor lax, a moderate creed. The best of mankind’s and his companions have set down an example for us to follow. One who treads in their footsteps is on the path of guidance. The custom of 40 days and Barsi is an innovation not found practised by Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] nor his companions [radhiallaahu anhu].\n\nThe loss of a loved one is very traumatic experience. The Prophet [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] cried at the loss of his children. Islam is a wonderful religion which grants its followers the ability to benefit one’s loved one who have passed away. There are two types of actions where one can benefit the deceased: a) Physical worship, e.g. du’aa, Dhikr, Tilaawat, etc.; b) Monetary worship, e.g. charity, etc.\n\nIsaal-e-Thawaab is where one gives the reward of his action to someone else. A person can read Nafl Salaat, make Nafl fast or give out Lillah with the intention of another person gaining the reward. There are many optional acts a person can do which can be the medium of another person gaining reward. When a person wants to send Isaal-e-Thawaab, he must not put himself in difficulty, for example, one wants to give charity but does not have the money resulting in borrowing, etc.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
