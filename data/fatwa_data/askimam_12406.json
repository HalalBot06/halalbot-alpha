  "answer": "QUESTION\nAccording to Fatawa no 10640 what are the further sollutions the trustees should follow?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two issues here; One is taking care of the Musjid. The other is to put a mechanism in place to bring about a reformation in the area.\n\nThe income of the people who are contributing to the Musjid is not permissible. However, they do have some feeling for Deen and wish to contribute to the upliftment of Deen. There is some softness in their hearts. That should be used as an opportunity to bring them on the straight path. Explain to them the purpose of life, the orders of Allah and the importance of Halaal income. Encourage them to change and reform their lives. The focus should not only be the upkeep of the Musjid but fulfilling the purpose of the Musjid which is reformation and closeness to Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
