  "question": "He gave me 3 Talaaqs. What is the ruling on that?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nmy hasband saidÂ  3 times i devorce you what is the hukum on that?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf your husband uttered the word divorce three times to you as a wife, then that constitutes a permanently irrevocable divorce (talaq-e-mughallaza).\n\nAs such, your nikah had been terminated. It is not permissible for both of you to live as husband and wife.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalam\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
