  "question": "Can the purchaser pay a certain amount to the seller to reserve the right to purchase the item?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI had a question regarding the trading of shares using this method. Please can you examine the content on the website below and let me know as to its permissibility with details.\nBasically, from my understanding, you are selling the right to someone to buy a share off you at a later date at the current price.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you shortly.\n\nhttp://www.cashforlifesystem.co.uk/\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nWe have examined the content on the website referred to in the query. We understand that the Company guides its clients in dealing with options and helps them in making the right decision to avoid loss and gain profit. \n\nAn option is the right to buy or sell a certain item at a fixed price within a certain date. It is not recognized as a tangible asset in Shari’ah; hence, it will not be permissible to buy or sell an option.\n\nMoreover, Shari’ah has prohibited the sale of ‘Urban as understood from the Narration of Nabi (Sallallahu 'Alaihi Wasallam) mentioned hereunder:\n\nعَنْ عَمْرِو بْنِ شُعَيْبٍ عَنْ أَبِيهِ عَنْ جَدِّهِ أَنَّهُ قَالَ نَهَى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ -صلى الله عليه وسلم- عَنْ بَيْعِ الْعُرْبَانِ. (رواه ابو داؤد)\n\nIt has been narrated on the authority of ‘Amr bin Sh’aib, who narrates from his father, who in tur narrates from his grandfather that Nabi (Sallallahu 'Alaihi Wasallam) forbade one from the sale of ‘Urban. (Abu Dawwod)\n\n‘Urban (also known as ‘Urboon) is a sale wherein the purchaser pays a certain amount to the seller to reserve the right to purchase the item. Thereafter, if he goes ahead with the sale and decides to purchase the item, he will pay the remainder amount and purchase the item; but if he decides not to purchase the item, the amount will not be returned to the purchaser. Dealing in options is also similar to this sale wherein a person reserves the right (option) to buy a certain item, but may not conclude the sale if the circumstances are not in his favour.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
