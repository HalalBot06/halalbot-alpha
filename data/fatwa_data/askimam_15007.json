Below is our standard answer on how to perform Nikah.\n\nThe Nikah will be only be valid with the following conditions:\n\n1. There must be a proposal from one side, e.g. “will you marry me?” and there must be acceptance from the other side. The acceptance should be in the past tense, e.g. “I have married you”, “I have accepted”.\n\n2. The proposal and acceptance must take place in the presence of two Baaligh (mature), sane Muslims.\n\nIf these two conditions are found, Nikah will take place. An Imaam and the Khutbah are not conditions for Nikah. (Qudoori pg.157; Qazi)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
