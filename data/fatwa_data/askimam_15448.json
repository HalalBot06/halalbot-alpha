However, if he was a Muslim (and it seems as though he was) it is permissible, in fact it is good to make duaa for him.\n\nYes, it is also permissible to perform Haje-Badal on his behalf or even a nafl haj on his behalf. You perform haj and transfer the thawaab over to him.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
