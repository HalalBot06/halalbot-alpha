  "question": "Is it permissible to join two salaats (like Duhr with Asr, and Magrib with Isha) when a person is travelling? Do any of the Madhabs allows this?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA Musaafir (traveller as termed by Shari'ah) must perform Qasr Salaat once\nhe/she sets out on a journey of three Manzils (88.864 km). 48 Shar'ee miles,\napproximately 54 English miles or more and intends staying at any particular\nplace for less than 15 days.\n\nQasr, the reduction of two Rakaats from four Rakaats Fardh Salaat is\ncompulsory. If the Musaafir is a Muqtadi and the Imaam is a Muqeem (i.e.\nnon-Musaafir), he (the Musaafir) will follow the Imaam and perform the four\nRakaats in full. Except for the abovementioned example, Qasr will inevitably\nhave to be carried out whether a person is familiar or not with a certain\nlocality.\n\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, it is not permissible for a traveller to\ncombine two Salaats in one time. Every Salaat must be performed timeously.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
