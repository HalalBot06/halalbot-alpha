  "question": "Is it permissible to read from the Quran (Mushaf) during non-obligatory Salaat based on the following narration regarding Bibi Aishah R.A.? Was any restriction placed on this practice by the Prophet?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs for the question on the permissibility of reading from the Mushaf in Prayer\", the eminent Muslim scholar, Dr. `Abdul-Fattah `Ashoor, Professor of the Exegesis of the Qur'an at Al-Azhar Univ., states: \"The more one reads the Qur'an in the correct way approved by Muslim scholars, the more rewards one receives. Performing supererogatory prayer while reading from the Mushaf (the copy of the Qur'an) is permissible, for `Aishah, Mother of the Believers, used to do so with her servant who used to lead her in supererogatory prayer while reading from the Mushaf. But, if reading from one's memory, without the Mushaf , leads one to concentrate and reflect on the meaning of the Qur'an and fill one with the joys of recitation, that will be better than reading form the Mushaf.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, it is not permissible to look into the Qur?aan and recite in Salaat.
