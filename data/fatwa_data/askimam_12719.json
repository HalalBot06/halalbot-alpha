Allah is Hakeem (All-Wise). There is certainly great wisdom in your family undergoing this condition. Allah tests those whom He loves, and rewards them on their Sabr and patience. Therefore, continue with the Sabr and be punctual on your Salaat. Purely, Allah creates easiness after hardship. You should wake up for Tahajjud Salaat and beg Allah for your needs. He accepts du?aas at the dead of night.\n\n2. Surah3 Aayat173\n\n3. Allaahummah ikfiniy bihalaalika an haraamika wa aghniniy bi fadhlika amman siwaaka\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
