  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamou Alaikum Mufti Sahab, I have a neighbour who is divorced and she is staying with her 3 yr old son. She is getting maintenance for the child. The child is currently going to an Islamic School. However, according to her, the father now wish, through legal action, to get the child to a private school. The mother is asking for Zaqaat money to defend the child. Is it alright to use zakaat money in this case?. The mother do have jewelleries etc. Jazak Allah for your attention.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf the mother has jewelry and its value is equivalent or more than the minimum Zakah amount and she does not have liabilities equivalent to the value of jewelry, then she is not legitimate recipient of Zakat.\n\nThe issue of the 3 year son going to school and the dispute between the parents requires further clarity. Is the son not too small to go to school? Why is there a dispute?\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
