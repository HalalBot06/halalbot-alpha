  "answer": "QUESTION\nQ1 I am going for haj inshallah this year but my haqeeqa was not done yet, what should I do, is it compulsory to do haqeeqa before haj as I stay away from my parents. Q2 my brother had performed the umra and he did not cut the hair and removed his ihram, is the damm compulsory, if yes can he give the damm with his haj this year\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Aqeeqah is Mustahabb in childhood, it is not compulsory before Hajj. If Hajj is compulsory upon you, then you should perform Hajj in this year even though your Aqeqah was not done.\n\n2. Damm is compulsory on your brother. When he goes for Hajj, then he must give Damm there.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
