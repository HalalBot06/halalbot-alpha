  "question": "Is it permissible for her to make Masah (wipe) instead of washing the head?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nA woman suffers from severe headaches and colds due to often washing of her hair in Fardh Ghusl (obligatory bath) after intercourse with her husband.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for such a woman to make Masah of the head. Allaamah Shaami states, ?A woman should not withhold herself from her husband, i.e. out of fear of falling ill due to Ghusl (bath) becoming obligatory upon her. Rather, she has been granted concession regarding the washing of her hair.? (Shaami vol.1 pg.153; HM Saeed)\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
