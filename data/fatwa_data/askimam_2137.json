  "question": "Ladies dying their hair and shaping their eyebrows?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nFirstly, Can Ladies dye their Hair other than black, using the different couloured dyes avalable in the market like Burgandy, Brown etc, not the Henna stuff? Secondly, Can Ladies shape thier eyebrows if they are too bushy and thick?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPure black dye is not permissible. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam)\nsaid, \"There will be people who will come later (in my Ummah) and apply\nblack dye. They will not even smell the fragrance of paradise.\" (Abu\nDaawood). However, it is permissible for a Mujaahid (warrior) to apply black\ndye in order to give the impression of being young. (Jawahirul Fiqh vol2\npg421)\n\nTo dye the hair any other colour besides black e.g. Mehndi or Katm (type of\ngrass) is permissible. This was the practice of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu\nÁlayhi Wasallam) and the Sahaaba (Radhiyallaahu Ánhum). (Jawahirul Fiqh vol2\npg421)\n\nNo, it is not permissible for females to pluck their eyebrows. Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) cursed a Mutanammisa (a female who seeks to\nremove her eyebrows).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
