  "answer": "QUESTION\nI live in a place where all these thigs are pretty much in the culture so i got blindfolded bu satan and got engaged physicaly with a woman (touched her only for quite a long time), now i repent on what i had done and want forgiveness from almighty allah, i have also started giving up other bad things like listning to music ... hope u could help me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is mentioned in a Hadith that one companion came to Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and said,?I unlawfully kissed a strange woman.? He replied, ?Do good action, for verily Allah Ta?ala says ?Good deeds repel bad deeds.? (Surah Hud)%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore, make Istighfaar and seek sincere repentance from Allah and exert yourself in good deeds, assuring yourself not to repeat the mistake.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah is Most Gracious and Most Merciful. He says in the Noble Qur'aan, 'Oh My Slaves! Do not despair. Verily Allah will forgive all sins.' %0D%0A%0D%0AIn one Hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, 'If a person has sins equivalent to the foams of the sea and pebbles on a desert, Allah's mercy is so encompassing that He will forgive every sin.' In another narration, it is mentioned that Allah will speak secretly to one of His slaves on the day of Qiyaamat and remind him of all his sins. After the person will confess his sins, Allah will say to him, 'I concealed your faults in the world, today too, I will conceal your faults. Go in Jannah, I have forgiven you.' %0D%0A%0D%0AThe above mentioned are few of many Ahaadith explaining the extent of Allah's Mercy. However, Allah says, 'Verily Allah will not forgive a person who ascribe partners (commit Shirk) with Him.' The only sin that is unforgivable is Kufr (disbelief) and Shirk (ascribing partners). Accepting Islam is the only atonement for the sin of Kufr and Shirk. %0D%0A%0D%0AIf one fulfils the conditions of repentance, i.e. regret and make firm intention to reform, then surely Allah Ta'ala is Tawwaab (Most Forgiving)%0D%0A%0D%0AYou should renew your Tawbah and again make a firm intention never to repeat the sin.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
