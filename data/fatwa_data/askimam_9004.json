  "question": "1)Please suggest some dua so that i can go abroad preferably to Madinah/Jeddah/USA/UK for doing job as a software engineer.I work as software engineer.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n2) Please advise on the below situation I was Offering Maghrib Prayer with Jamaath, I Was there in all the 3 rakaths, I mean I have'nt missed any rakath however when the imam sahab completed the namaz by saying Salam I stood up by mistake and offered and extra rakath, i realised this while making the sajadah of this extra rakath and did sajde sahu. Is My prayer valid, becoz I offered 4 rakaths instead of 3 for Magrhib. Will sajde sahu suffice in this case. While offering 4 faraz or sunnah prayer of Zuhur individually, In the 4th rakath I was a bit confused and was'nt able to decide whether I was offering the third or fourth rakath, Since i'm not sure whether i'm in 4th or 3rd rakath, so can i go ahead and assumed that its 3rd rakath and offer an extra rakath and later offer Sajd-e-sahoo. My decison will lead to 2 things a) If i was really in 3rd Rakah then the extra rakath which I offered became the 4th rakath.But I did sajd-e-sahoo which was not required, So In this case is my prayer valid. b) If I was really in 4th Rakath then the extra rakath which I offered became the 5th rakath, I mean totally i offered 5 rakath instead of 4.Is sajde-Sahu Suffice in this case, or i need to repeat the prayers all over no matter whether its farz or sunnah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Recite ?Rabb anzilniy munazalan mubaarakan wa anta khayrul munzileen? as much as possible. May Allah Ta?ala grant you a good abode to settle down, Aameen.\n\n2. /3 The Maghrib Salaat will be valid by making Sajda-e-Sahw at the ending. If you had a doubt between being in the third Rakaat or fourth Rakaat, you should apply your honest discretion and go by that. In this situation, there is no need to make Sajda-e-Sahw. If you were unable to make a decision, then go by what is certain between the two. In the enquired case, third Rakaat. However, perform Tashahhud in both remaining Rakaats as there is a possibility you are in the fourth Rakaat and make Sajda-e-Sahw at the end. The Salaat will be valid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
