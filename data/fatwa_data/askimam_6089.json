  "question": "It is being propagated in the Western countries that people are homosexual by birth, it’s in their genes, and they can’t help it, and that’s why it’s normal and should be accepted. Your comments?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHOMOSEXUALITY IN THE LIGHT OF ISLAM%0D%0A%0D%0AThe aim of natural sexuality is procreation. Lawful and natural sexual%0D%0Arelations between man and woman has been designed by Allah to preserve the%0D%0Ahuman race here on earth. Homosexuality is negatory of the natural role and%0D%0Aaim of sexual activity.%0D%0A%0A%0D%0AThe experts on homosexuality and other forms of sexual deviation advance a%0D%0Aseries of groundless assumptions in their discussion on the causes of such%0D%0Aunnatural sexuality. They attribute it to hereditary taints, genetic causes,%0D%0Aenvironmental influences, animal instincts in man, etc. In certain cases,%0D%0Ae.g. 'transiet homosexuality' where men are separated from women such as%0D%0Aprisons, same sex institutions, etc. they argue that the criminal's blame%0D%0Awill be considered as diminished in view of his circumstances.%0D%0A%0D%0AIslam does not accept any type of justification for the unnatural sin of%0D%0Ahomosexuality regardless of any biological, psychological or environmental%0D%0Afactors which may influence a man to indulge in this type of grossly%0D%0Aunnatural immorality. This should not be interpreted to mean that Islam does%0D%0Anot recognize the reality or validity of the existence of the various%0D%0Afactors which influence man to commit homosexuality. However, the presence%0D%0Aof any destructive influences which lead man towards this unnatural and%0D%0Abestial act of immorality does not constitute a valid excuse for indulgence%0D%0Ain acts of deviation and inhumanity. Just as fornication, rape and other%0D%0Acriminal acts of immorality cannot be condoned because of biological,%0D%0Apsychological, environmental, factors, etc, which may be the causes which%0D%0Aoccasion the crime, so too, can these factors not be cited in favour of%0D%0Adiminished blame for the act of homosexuality. In spite of the existence of%0D%0Athe factors (described as causes) of adultery, human culture does not permit%0D%0Aman and woman to indulge in this crime notwithstanding the naturalness of%0D%0Aheterosexuality. They are required to restrain themselves and behave within%0D%0Athe bounds of chastity and morality.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn like manner man is required to exercise restraint and overcome his%0D%0Aemotional, biological demands, etc. and manage the disturbances within him.%0D%0AHe, as a member of the highest species of Allah's creation, is under moral%0D%0Aobligation to control the dictates of his lust - whether such lust directs%0D%0Ahim towards unnatural or natural avenues - and refrain from smearing his%0D%0Asoul and intellect in such loathsome indulgence.%0D%0A%0D%0AModern studies and the many consequent theories regarding the crime of%0D%0Ahomosexuality lend to convey a blurred conception of the Biological%0D%0Adisturbances as well as some environmental factors are even tendered as%0D%0Amitigating circumstances to reduce the stigma and the blame from the%0D%0Ahomosexual. This idea has made homosexuals daring and revengeful of their%0D%0Aunnatural crimes. They have come to regard their misdirected lust as morally%0D%0Aacceptable. They, as well as the 'experts' who have undertaken research in%0D%0Ahomosexuality, have deceived themselves into believing in the idea of%0D%0Adiminished, blame and moral acceptance, of this unnatural act. As long as%0D%0Aman's intelligence is not inflicted with insanity, he is held responsible%0D%0Afor his actions and he is Islamically under compulsion to restrain his%0D%0Aperverted cravings so that he does not descend into a sub-human level of%0D%0Aexistence.%0D%0A%0D%0AMan's gratification of his sexual appetite with another man has a long%0D%0Ahistory of its own. The Qur'an bears testimony t the fact that the people of%0D%0Athe prophet Lut (Alayhis salaam), the nephew of Ibriham (Alayhis salaam),%0D%0Asent as a warning to the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, were those who%0D%0Ainitiated this heinous practice. Before them it was unknown. In this%0D%0Aconnection the Qur'an mentions:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"We also sent Lut. He said to his people, 'Do you commit indecency such as%0D%0Ano people in creation (ever) committed before you? For you practise your%0D%0Alusts on men in preference to women; you are indeed a people transgressing%0D%0Abeyond bounds.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AThese Sodomites even indulged in their homosexual orgies publicly. Their%0D%0Awickedness had attained the level where the mere sight of a handsome young%0D%0Aman made them so agitated that they pounced upon him as famished people%0D%0Awould fall on food. Even honoured guests did not enjoy immunity or any%0D%0Aprivileged position. They did not hesitate in even resorting to violence in%0D%0Aachieving their lustful object.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Qur'aan has depicted the scene when the angels of punishment Lut%0D%0A(Alayhis salaam) as his guests in the guise of handsome young men. Hadrat%0D%0ALut (Alayhis salaam) did not recognized them in the first instance. But he%0D%0Aknew the shameless habit of his people. He was extremely distressed and he%0D%0Aapprehended that his people would certainly demand unnatural and shameful%0D%0Asexual activity. His apprehension was correct. They could not sit silently%0D%0Aat the news of such \"boys\" of excellent beauty. These sodomites recklessly%0D%0Arushed to the home of Lut (Alayhis salaam) to gratify their unnatural%0D%0Adesires. Lut (Alayhis salaam) found himself in a difficult situation. He%0D%0Aprompted them to legally satisfy their sexual appetite with women even%0D%0Aoffering his daughter in lawful marriage to the most gentle of them, and not%0D%0Ainsisting on this unnatural outlet. Then he very effectively appealed to%0D%0Athem, in the name of Almighty, that they should abstain from disgracing him%0D%0Aby dishonouring his guests.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Qur'an states:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"And his people came rushing towards him, and they had been long in the%0D%0Ahabit of practising abominations. He said: \"O my people! Here are my%0D%0Adaughters: they ore purer for you (if you marry)! Now fear Allah, and cover%0D%0Ame not with shame about my guests! Is there not among you a right-handed%0D%0Aman?\"%0D%0A%0D%0ABut the accursed people inflamed with evil passions turned a deaf ear to all%0D%0Ahis reasoning with them. They had lost all sense of morality and were blind%0D%0Ain their voluptuous sentiments. On this occasion they even taunted him for%0D%0Ahis frequent protests in the past against their sins. Hadrat Lut (Alayhis%0D%0Asalaam) seemed helpless in the situation in which he found himself, - alone%0D%0Aagainst a rabble of people inflamed with lustful passions. He wished he had%0D%0Athe strength to suppress them himself or had some powerful support to lean%0D%0Aon! But the powerful support was there, though he had not realized it till%0D%0Athen. It was the support of the Almighty. His guests were not ordinary men,%0D%0Abut Angels who had come to test the people before they inflicted punishment.%0D%0AThey now declared themselves and gave him directions to get away before the%0D%0Amorning, when the punishment would descend on the doomed cities. Even in%0D%0ALut's (Alayhis salaam) household was one, i.e. his wife, who detracted from%0D%0Athe harmony of the family. She lagged behind and looked back, i.e. one whose%0D%0Amental and moral attitude, in spite of association with the righteous was to%0D%0Ahark back to the glitter of wickedness and sin. Finally, the wrath of%0D%0AAlmighty descended upon them, their cities were turned upside down and%0D%0Ashowers of stone rained on them. Regarding this the Qur'aan mentions:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"Then when Our decree came to pass. We turned the cities upside down, and We%0D%0Arained thereon stones of baked clay, piled up.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AThe punishment of turning upside down given to this people resembles%0D%0Aoutwardly their shameless deed of homosexuality. The shower of stone was%0D%0Avery thick so as to form layers. It is also said that the name of each man%0D%0Awas written or engraved on those stones which were the cause of their%0D%0Aannihilation. The inversion of cities by way of punishment was the task%0D%0Awhich was assigned to Jibraaell (Alayhis salaam). Homosexuality is also a%0D%0Aform of sexual inversion, hence the type of punishment was most befitting in%0D%0Athat it also symbolized their unnatural acts of immorality. Showers of%0D%0Astones (not hail-stones, but real stones) are not a normal occurrence. So%0D%0Atoo, the punuhment of the inversion of the cities (was quite rightly%0D%0Ajustified). Thus, unnatural forms of punishment were prescribed by Allah for%0D%0Athe unnatural sins of the homosexual community.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe community of Lut (Alayhis salaam) was a prosperous nation materially and%0D%0Athey inhabited five cities: Sodom, Gamurah, Udmah, Laboobem and Sughar. The%0D%0AQur'aan refers collectively to these five cities with the term Mu'tafikaat%0D%0A(the inverted cities). The cities are so designated because of the perverted%0D%0Acrimes of sexual inversion of their inhabitants and because they were%0D%0Aphysically inverted and eliminated by the command of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0ABefore the people of Sodom, never did this evil even enter the mind of%0D%0Amankind, let alone practicing it. The Umayyad Khalifah \"Abdul Malik said%0D%0Athat if this episode of the homosexuals was not mentioned in the Qur'an, he%0D%0Awould not have conceded the reality of this crime since it was unthinkable%0D%0Athat man will descend to such a degenerate level and debase himself in a%0D%0Atype of act which is not indulged in by even the overwhelming majority of%0D%0Alowly beasts.'%0D%0A%0D%0ANevertheless, even after the community to which prophet Lut (Alayhis salaam)%0D%0Awas sent as cautioner, met their catastrophic end, sodomy continued and even%0D%0Asometimes flourished. It is now known that homosexuality existed before the%0D%0Apre-Christian era among the so-called 'civihilised' nations of the world%0D%0Aespecially the Greeks and Romans. It was not only confined to common masses,%0D%0Abut even legendary and prominent figures such as Socrates, Aristotle, Julius%0D%0ACaesar and many others practiced it. (Miftahi)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn thirteenth century France, homosexuality was the great craze of the day%0D%0Aand the government of the country had to enact a law that those found of%0D%0Aguilty of this unnatural crime will be put to death. And Germany was not far%0D%0Abehind in the pursuit of this craze. Before Nazi Germany there was a famous%0D%0Aperson, Dr Magnus Herschefield, (who had been the president of the society%0D%0Afor the Reformation of Sexual behaviour), who launched powerful propaganda%0D%0Ain favour of sodomy for six years. Finally 'democracy' acceded to this%0D%0Ademand and the strictly forbidden became approved. It was decided by%0D%0Amajority vote that homosexuality among the males was no longer an offence%0D%0Aprovided it was indulged in with mutual consent of the parties involved and%0D%0Ain case of the object of the unnatural love being a minor, his guardian had%0D%0Ato give his consent. In the Orient, Iran has been notorious and Persian%0D%0Apoetry amply supports it. Karachi has also been named in this regard. It is%0D%0Asaid there were three centres there, where eunuchs carried on that unnatural%0D%0Abusiness. Afghanistan (then under Communist influence) has also been%0D%0Amentioned. India, too, is not so clean in her records in this field,%0D%0Aalthough the common people are involved in it to a limited extent. It is the%0D%0Aeducated and the sophisticated people who take to it as a diversion. The%0D%0Aeducational institutions, schools, colleges and centres of oriental studies%0D%0Atoo are not free from this curse.%0D%0A%0D%0AIslam strictly forbade this detestable deed and prescribed the severed%0D%0Apunishment, relenting not in the least in making it a deterrent. The Qur'aan%0D%0Acautions that once people take to homosexuality, they sink to the depths of%0D%0Amoral degradation. The admonitory punishment meted out to these%0D%0Atransgressors was described in such a moving way that those reciting the%0D%0AQur'an may learn the harsh consequences of this evil, and may protect%0D%0Athemselves from this outrageous crime. To deter the Muslims from evil, the%0D%0AQur'aan initially declared to those participating in this perversion:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"If two men among you are guilty of indecency, punish them both.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AOnce Prophet Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) expressed his%0D%0Aanticipated fear by stating that among the evils that his ummah can take to,%0D%0Ahe feared sodomy most. In fact, this was a forewarning measure that the%0D%0Aummah may guard against, realizing that the prophet himself had forbidden%0D%0Ait. On one occasion Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) declared:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"Whoever gratifies his sexual urge with another (individual%7D of his own%0D%0Asex,, Almighty will not so much as look at him.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AUndoubtedly, sodomy is one of the most repulsive acts, even observed among%0D%0Abeasts. Therefore, the sight of a homosexual will be so disgusting to Allah%0D%0Athat it will intensify His anger to heights where He will not even consider%0D%0Aglancing at a sodomist. Through this act, man degrades his humanity and%0D%0Aannounces extermination as his policy. Moreover, it implies wretchedness and%0D%0Amisery of the womenfolk and he himself is prone to so many diseases: the%0D%0Abasic organs of his body, brain, heart, liver and kidneys become deficiently%0D%0Aimmune (AIDS), his face lacks the sparkle of health and he looks off-colour%0D%0Aand melancholy, with the result that such an incapacitated criminal becomes%0D%0Aworthless to women. This wretched outcast deprives himself of the bounty of%0D%0Aprocreation and the priceless jewel of morality.%0D%0A%0D%0A[ morality in Islam, Acaciaville]"
