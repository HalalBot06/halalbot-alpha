So please advise me what shall I do? I want to leave this job but I don?t want to kick the Rriskh or give me any good dua?a for getting increment, I am very upset, please advise me what I have to do? I appreciate your kind cooperation and help in this matter, Jazzakumullah Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala states in the noble Qur'aan, 'Indeed Allah Ta'ala is with those%0D%0Awho are patient.' Without any doubt, your approach to this matter is highly%0D%0Alaudable because it is mentioned in the Hadith that is is much benefit in%0D%0Aconsulting.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is understood that you have certainly dealt with all those impediments%0D%0Awith regards to your salary increment, such as, the policies and%0D%0Arequirements of your company upon you are met by you entirely. Therefore, it%0D%0Awill now be appropriate for you to hand over a letter to the management%0D%0Astating that your request has been unattended to, and the reason for you to%0D%0Ahand over this letter is that you would like to receive a more favourable%0D%0Areception, on the basis of your theory and experience.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, this point should be well understood that with great status comes%0D%0Agreat responsibility, the result should not be that with great%0D%0Arespondibility, a person becomes negligent. Firstly, to the obligations of%0D%0AIslam and secondly to his family. Our Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has%0D%0Asaid that a person should take the opportunity and appreciate his free time%0D%0Abefore his is occupied.%0D%0A%0D%0ACertainly, the best and only solution to unfavourable conditions is to turn%0D%0Ato Allah Ta'ala who is the best of sustainers, and Allah Ta'ala himself%0D%0Asays, 'Is there anyone who seeks any goodness in the matters of the world,%0D%0Alet him ask and it shall be granted.' And if you are sincere and regular%0D%0Awith asking Allah Ta'ala for all your needs, you will see how Allah takes%0D%0Acare of all your affairs, and you will definitely see how smoothly your%0D%0Aaffairs will run and you will live a life of peace and contentment, no%0D%0Aworries at all, and this is all because you turn to Allah. lastly, you can%0D%0Anever go wrong because Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) told the Sahaaba%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhu) to read two Rakaats of Salaat and make Du'aa to Allah%0D%0Afor whatever needs they had - and the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhu) were%0D%0Aalways happy - because they turn to Allah Ta'ala and Allah granted them%0D%0Awhatever they asked for. 'And surely Allah Ta'ala is the best of planners%0D%0Aand the best of sustainers.'%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
