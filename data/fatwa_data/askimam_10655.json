  "question": "are we allowed to charge our customers for late payments?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe have a wholesale business in which we give our customers credit terms e.g. Payment due from date of Invoice. Sometimes the customer does not pay on time and because of this, a small amount of a loss is made. What I wanted to know is, are we allowed to charge our customers for late payments? e.g. late payment fee? Can you interpret this dream? I saw in a dream two Crescent Shape Moons (or Â¼ Shaped Moons) facing each other with stars scattered around at night in my dream. Is there a meaning to this? Wassallam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible to charge customers a late payment fee. If you feel that a customer will not pay timeously, then you may inflate the credit payments and the final amount due. This may assist in alleviating the loss due to late payments.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
