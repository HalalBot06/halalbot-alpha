  "question": "Please be so kind and tell me is it true that certain colours of clothing are haraam for men to wear, if so which colours are haraam and why ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Makrooh (disliked) for men to wear red or yellow clothes. (Shaami vol.6 pg.358; HM Saeed)\n\nHowever, this refers to the entire garment being red or yellow. If the colours are broken with other colours, it will not be Makrooh to wear these clothes.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
