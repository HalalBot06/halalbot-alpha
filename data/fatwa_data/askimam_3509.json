  "question": "On behalf of my kaafir father: \"Is it OK, that my Muslim daughter raise a glass of wine in a toast to my wife and I for our 50th wedding anniversary at dinner with the rest of the family?\"",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am the only Muslim in my Catholic family. They saw me for the first time since my reversion 2 years ago alhamdulillah. My father insists that I go to a \"clergy\" for \"spritual guidance\" on a matter concerning \"When in Rome, do as the Romans do.\" They want me to also hug my brother-in-law because this is what they do, and they want me to 'do as the romans do' when I am with them.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'There is no obedience to the\ncreation of Allah against the order of Allah.'\n\nIt is Haraam to follow the customs of the Kuffaar in celebrating wedding\nanniversary, intermingling of sexes, wine, parties, etc. You should maintain\nfamily ties with your father but never compromise in going against the order\nof Allah Ta'ala and Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
