  "question": "Fundraising event for a non Muslim teacher",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nA female non-Muslim teacher had an accident and now she’s paralized.  Now, she needs to have her house to be adapted [for example, she’d need wheelchairs, etc] because of her not being able to do things normally.  So, her friends are fundraising for money which are required for this purpose.  To fundraise, they’re arranging a festival where music and wine drinking will be involved.  In this case, is it permissible for me to just send the money for the actual purpose instead of attending the feast?\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n Assalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nYou may forward your contribution without attending the fundraising party for which you will be rewarded. Furthermore, if you are in the position to advise them that instead of spending money on the party and entertainment, the same amount may be used for the benefit of the disabled.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nChecked and Approved by,\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
