  "question": "1). If you go to hajj from a different country how do you calculate if you are a musaafir or not, because do you look at the fact you are resident in another country",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nor do you look to the specific towns you are resident in. I ask this because if you look at the fact you are away from your HOME, then you are away for over 15 days, but if you calculate it in terms of being resident in Makkah or in Madinah, then it is less than 15 i.e you are in makkah for maybe 5 days so you are a musaafir, then in madinah for 8 days so you are a musaafir, then maybe you are in makkah and surrounding areas during hajj for 20 days so you are muqeem now. Could you please explain this as I am confused if I am considered a musaafir throughout my stay in Saudi, or sometimes I am musaafir or Muqeem depending on where I am staying and for how long. 2). If during any type of tawaf one breaks his wudu or needs to go the toilet, can he interrupt his tawaf and resume it where he stopped, or does he have to start all over again or start that circuit from the beginning even if his wudu broke near the end of the circuit? 3).In taleemul haq it says that a female muhrim must not cut her own hair to release herself from ihram, but on this site you have said it is ok to do this, please explain. Also, if a woman does not cut her hair from 3 different places but only a fingertips length from one area of her hair, is this still ok? 4). Can a woman enter ihram eventhough she is on her menses when at the area of meeqat for example when she is on an aeroplane and there is nothing she can do about it? Jazak Allah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The basic ruling is as follows: If a person intends to stay at one place ? town or city ? for 15 days or more, he becomes a Muqeem. He has to perform the full Salaat, etc. In the case mentioned by you, the person is a Musaafir in Madinah. As for Makkah, if he intends to live 15 days or more continuously in Makkah, he ceases to become a Musaafir and becomes a Muqeem. However, if he ? for instance ? intends to live for 12 days in Makkah and 5 days in Mina and then 5 days in Makkah, he still remains a Musaafir.\n\n2. He should continue from wherever he left out.\n\n3. The view expressed in Taleemul Haqq is a more cautious view and the view expressed on the site merely indicates permissibility.\n\n4. Yes, a woman may enter Ihraam even if she is in her menses. She would make Ghusl as normal and make intention of Ihraam. This Ghusl is not for Taharah but for Ihraam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
