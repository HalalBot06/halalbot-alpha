  "question": "All of us can speak and understand \"URDU\". I speak in \"PASHTO\" as I feel comfortable with this language. between the talk, I start talking in \"URDU\". Is it a sin or not?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI speak \"PASHTO\" in a \"MAJLIS\" with other \"PASHTO\" speaking brothers while there are other brothers in the same \"MAJLIS\" who do not understand \"PASHTO\". All of us can speak and understand \"URDU\". I speak in \"PASHTO\" as I feel comfortable with this language. I do it as a habit. On reminding between the talk, I start talking in \"URDU\". The other brothers feel neglected at this as they do not understand the talk. Can this act of mine be counted as \"SARGOSHI\"? Is it a sin or not? What can be done in order to change this habit?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn a mixed gathering of people from different nationalities, the common language should be spoken to accommodate all.\n\nHowever, talking in an uncommon language will not be prohibited in the category of Sargoshi (secret talking) as that is done out of habit.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
