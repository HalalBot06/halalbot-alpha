  "question": "Are women allowed to offer their salaah in congregation by themselves in their own homes?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAre women allowed to offer their salaah in congregation by themselves in their own homes? ie. The imaam will be a woman and all females will follow behind her. Like this are females allowed to perform taraweeh in this manner. Jazakallh\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Makrooh for women to perform Salaat in a congregation of females only even in Taraweeh Salaat. (Shaami vol.1 pg.565)\n\nSayyidatuna Aaisha (Radhiallaahu Anha) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?There is no good in the congregation of females except in the main Musjid (with men) or in Janaaza.? (Musnad Ahmad & Tabrani ? see I?elaa-us-sunan vol.4 pg.242)\n\nSayyiduna Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu) is also authentically reported to have prohibited this. (Ibid).\n\nOne of the reasons mentioned by the Fuqahaa is that the Imaam will have to stand in the middle of the first Saff. This act in itself is Makrooh. There is no proof to show that the female Imaam should stand in front.
