  "question": "1)Do Hanifi women need to keep their arms slightly raised during sajda or must it remain flat on the ground? 2) As a Hanifi can I read my salat Shafi'ee way?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was taught in school to keep my arms flat on the ground as we needed to get as close to the floor as possible, however my Shafi friends told me not to as it imitates a dog. I know hanifi men do not keep their arms on the ground but raised in sajda. 2) As a Hanifi can I read my salat Shafi way? There are certain postures which I prefer in the Shafi Mashab.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHadhrat ibn %DAmar (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'When a woman sits in Sajdah by putting one thigh%0D%0Aupon the other (i.e. close to one another) and at the time of Sajdah%0D%0A(prostration) her stomach touches her thighs (i.e. whilst worshipping Allah)%0D%0Aand she also takes full consideration of Hijaab, then Allah Ta%E3la looks at%0D%0Aher and says to the angels, 'Bear witness that I have forgiven her.' (Kanzul%0D%0AUmmaal p. 117)%0D%0A%0D%0AOnce Nabi (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) saw two women making Salaat, he%0D%0Asaid, 'When you (women) make Sajdah then let the limbs of your body touch%0D%0Aone another and make them touch the ground.' Surely in this (limbs clustered%0D%0Aone to another and touching the ground) women are not similar to men.'%0D%0A(Masaail Abu Dawood p. 223)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Wail ibn Hajar (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) said that Nabi (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam) taught him to read Salaat and he said, 'O ibn Hajar! When%0D%0Ayou begin your Salaat then lift your hands up to your ears and show the%0D%0Awomen that they should lift up to their chests.' (Majmauz zawaaid; Tabraani)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat ibn %DAmar (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) was once asked on how did the women%0D%0Aread Salaat in the time of Nabi (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam). He replied,%0D%0A'First they used to read Salaat cross-legged, then they were commanded to%0D%0Acling to themselves,' (Jaami al-Masaanid p. 400)%0D%0A%0D%0AAs a Hanafi, you cannot follow the Shaaf'ee method of performing Salaat%0D%0Awithout a valid reason.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
