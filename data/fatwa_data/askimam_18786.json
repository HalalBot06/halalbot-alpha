By facing challenges and tests in our daily life we should not lose hope and become desponded; rather we should become stronger in our faith and conviction in Allah Ta’ala. We should take these challenges to be all from the side of Allah Ta’ala. It is our true belief that all good and bad which befalls a believer is from the side of Allah Ta’ala.\n\nNabi Sallalahu Allaihi Wassalam has mentioned in a Hadith;\n\nعن أبى هريرة قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم  إن الله لا ينظر إلى صوركم وأموالكم ولكن ينظر إلى قلوبكم وأعمالكم.\n\nVerily Allah Ta’ala does not look at your figure or wealth  , rather He looks at your heart and actions.[1]\n\n \n\nSo similarly, you should not be desponded by facing these challenges, rather you should take it to be a passing phase in your life. After all we see in the above hadith that a person’s outer appearance is not judged by Allah Ta’ala. In order for a person to be successful a person’s actions is taken into consideration.\n\nLikewise you should work towards your future by beautifying your actions and leave all these worldly distractions aside. You should make dua to Allah Ta’ala and ask him to make every stage of your life easy and He should make you a true obedient servant of his. Together with that you should be punctual on your 5 daily Salaah, recitation of the Holy Quraan, Tasbeeh Faatimi after every Salaah, assisting your mum in the daily household chores etc; and in your free time you should read the books of the pious and illustrious scholars of Islam, like Behisti Zewar of Moulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi and the Fadaail Amaal of Hadrat Sheikh Zakariya Rahimahumullahu rahmataw waasiatan and many other reliable authors. Inshallah if you would follow the examples of these pious and extraordinary women mentioned in these books, Allah Ta’ala would make you from amongst them. Ameen\n\n \n\nWe make dua to Allah Ta’ala that he reliefs you from your distress and grants you a peaceful and a blissful life. Ameen\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMufti Luqman Hansrot,\nChecked and Approved by:\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā\n\n\n\n\n[1] صحيح مسلم, باب تحريم ظلم المسلم  , مكتبه رشيدية, دهلى , ج2 , ص317 ."
