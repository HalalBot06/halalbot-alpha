  "question": "Can an unmarried woman perform hajj with the money that she has earned herself?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am an unmarried muslim woman and I wish to perform the Hajj accompanied with my father or my brother using the money I have earned. Will this Hajj count as the obligatory or fard Hajj that I am supposed to perform in my lifetime? Or would I have to perform it again after I get married?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, it is necessary for women to be accompanied by a Mahram (men she cannot marry) when undertaking a journey. Therefore, it is permissible for you to perform Hajj with your father or brother who may serve as a Mahram for you.\n\nOnce you have performed the Hajj before marriage, you will be absolved from your obligation. It is not necessary to re-perform the Hajj after you get married.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
