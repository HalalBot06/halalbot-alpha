Only the Duff is allowed under certain specific situations and conditions. It will be permissible to listen to Yusuf Islam, etc. cassettes if they do not contain musical instruments.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. There is a difference of opinion between the Ulama on this issue. Some have ruled it to be permissible while others have regarded it as impermissible. However, we should remember that certain actions being found abundantly in Makkah%2FMadinah is not a proof according to Shari?ah. There are numerous things found nowadays in Makkah and Madinah which can unanimously be declared as impermissible.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. The Qur?aan does not state everythuing from the sea is Halaal. %0D%0A%0D%0A4. According to the Hanafi Madhab, the best way to discard it is to bury it.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Interest should be given to the poor who do not have the Nisaab of Zakaat. This is not the normal Sadaqah which a Muslim gives out of his lawful income with an intention to get reward in the hereafter. Instead, this Sadaqah is meant only for dispensing off an unclean and unlawful money and to relieve oneself from the burden of an illgotten gain. But it should be remembered that this amount is unclean only for the person who received it as interest. The poor person who get it from him as Sadaqah can use this amount for their personal benefits. This amount can also be given to one?s close relatives who are entitled to receive Zakaat. Even one?s adult children can receive this amount from him if they are so poor that they can receive Zakaat. (Contemporary Fataawa pg.160)%0D%0A%0D%0AHence, one may give it to one?s mother if she is entitled to receive Zakaat. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
