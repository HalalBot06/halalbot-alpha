  "question": "brothers making ruqyah syariah by reciting few ayats from the holy qur’an. Is this method permissible ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nRecently, we have so many brothers making ruqyah syariah  by reciting few ayats from the holy qur’an. Those brothers who are being cured by ruqyah, suddenly (some of them) will react in strange ways... signing that jinn is inside their body.\n\nMy questions is:\n\nIs this method permissible ?\nIf we recite qur’an constantly/ daily , won’t the jinn come out from our body automatically? What is the different between these ruqyah?\nThey said that the sign someone is having a jiinn inside their body is : being lazy for shalat, reading qur’an, sleepy, dizzy etc.  Is this true? Jazakallah khair ........ looking forward for your reply..\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe practice of Ruqya, reading some portion of the Qur’aan and certain du’aas and blowing on the affected person is mentioned in the Hadith. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and the Sahaaba [radhiallaahu anhum] practiced on Ruqya.\n\nWe are not Aamils (experts dealing in Jinns and black magic) and therefore we are not qualified enough to comment on issues related to black magic and Jinn.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
