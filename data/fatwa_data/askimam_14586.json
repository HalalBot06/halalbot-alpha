  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs Namaz e traweeh is farz or sunnat. Without offering this will fast be valid or nullified.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nTaraweeh Salah is an emphasized Sunnah. It is established from Ahadith and the practice of the Sahaba. The Ummah in every generation upheld Taraweeh and performed Taraweeh with great importance. It is a sin not to perform Taraweeh. The validity of the fast does not depend on performing Taraweeh. However, the value and spirituality of the fast is decreased by not performing Taraweeh.      \n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\n Mufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
