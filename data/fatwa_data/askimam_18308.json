  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDear Imaam Sahab Assalam u alaikum......\n\nIn the book of Mastrubation you have mentioned that {Allah Ta'ala has premitted them to approach their wives and slave-girls. } What does it mean? is this permissible to any one to approach their slave girls to have sex with them without marriage? How is it possible? is this not haraam? If we have sex with any other women except our wives it is haraam and Zina. then how is it possible to have sex with the slave girls? Please explain this phrase with the detailed explanation and with the proofs of quraan and hadees.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nThe verse which you have mentioned appears in Surah Muminun and in Surah Ma’arij. The meaning of this verse is as follows:-\n\n \n\nوَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِفُرُوجِهِمْ حَافِظُونَ (5) إِلَّا عَلَى أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ غَيْرُ مَلُومِينَ (6)\n\n“And those who guard their private parts except from their wives and those (slave-girls) which their right-hands own - so there is no blame upon them.’’ (Surah Al-Muminuun, Ayah 5/ 6-Al-Ma’arij 29/30.)\n\n \n\nAllah Ta’ala makes mention at the beginning of this chapter in the Qur’an, “Indeed the believers are successful”. One of the reasons for them being successful is that they satisfy their carnal desires with their wives and legal slavegirls according to the prescribed laws of the Qur’an and they avoid any unlawful interactions. This does not mean that a person can now commit adultery with whomsoever he wishes. Furthemore, this verse is in reference to the period in which slavery was customary. If a person became the owner of a slave, either through spoils of war or legal purchase, then only that particular slave was halaal for him. Once she was sold or freed, the right to attain any sort of benefit through her immediately terminated. However, in todays times the custom of slavery is no longer found, therefore this verse will not apply to the present day and age.\n\n \n\n(Ma’ariful Qur’an V6)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
