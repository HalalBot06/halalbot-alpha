  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn Ramazan, at some mosques two Imams lead the Isha/Taraweeh prayers. One Imam leads the Fard and Vitr prayers where as other Imam leads the Taraweeh prayers. The latter Imam after finishing the Taraweeh prayers moves back and the former Imam leads the Vitr. My question Is\n\nIs it necessary that the one who has lead the Fard prayers should also lead the Vitr prayers or the latter Imam can also lead the Vitr prayers.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe Imaams for all three â€“ Eshaa, Taraweeh and Witr Salaats - could be one or different. One person may lead even two Salaats, Esha and Witr and the Taraweeh Salaat could be led by another person.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
