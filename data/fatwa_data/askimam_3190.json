  "question": "What do you do if your wudhu keeps on breaking?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nImam, i have started praying my 5-times- a-day namaz for a year and recently i have come across a problem. During my namazes I frequently keep breaking my wudhu due to wind. It happens in Fajr when temperatures are quite low so doing wudhu again is quite hard. I do get quite frustrated and end up angry and feeling that my namaz has not been counted. Please could you advise me on what to do.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nKindly refer to the rules pertaining to a Ma'zur\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
