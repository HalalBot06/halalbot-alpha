  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy wife missed about 20 days during Ramadhan 5 years ago due to the imminent birth of our child and due to doctor's advice because it may complicate things. Also the last 2 years, she did not fast because she was on her menstrual cycle. Does she have to make up all the fasts? She does not mind making them up but she is a weak person and fasting in Ramadhan is already difficult for her. Can we pay for the fasts and feed the poor instead? Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen a person misses a fardh fast, he/she is required to make this up as soon as possible. (Qadhaa). If he/she is unable to do so presently, he/she may delay the Qadhaa until he/she is able to fulfill it. If he/she has a very limited life expectancy and fears he/she will not be able to recover sufficiently to make these up before his/her death, he/she may pay Fidyah, in lieu of each fast, an amount equivalent to Sadaqatul Fitr. This must be given to someone deserving of Zakaah.\n\nYour wife's situation does not seem to be so serious. We suggest that she make up one fast every week. Furthermore, this may be done in winter when the days are short so as to make it even easier.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
