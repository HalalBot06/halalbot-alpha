  "question": "If a person touches a pig on a dry spot, can he lick his hand later without washing it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAlsalamu alaykum If a person touches a pig on a dry spot, can he lick his hand later without washing it? What if he touches a food, can he eat it? Will it break wudhu? I ask cause basketballs and footballs are made of leather, and I know pig skin is or was used for footballs. At restaurants that serve haram food(pork,bacon etc.), if food spills on a table that is pig, then the restaurant wipes it before you eat; if you spill rice on the table can you eat it(considering the cloth they wiped it wipes other haram before it)? This last question is bad, and I am ashamed to ask. If a person accidently touches your private part while walking by or something, and you get an arousal from it though you don't like that, is it a sin? Jazakum Allahu khayran\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. A pig is Najsul-Ayn (completely impure). It is not permissible to use any product of a pig as well as any product manufactured from it. However, if it is dry, for example, a ball, shoes, etc. then touching it does not make one impure. There is no need to wash the hand or make Wudhu.\n\n2. It is not a sin for being aroused by someone who is touched accidentally.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
