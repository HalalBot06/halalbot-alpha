  "question": "What Syed means? Some people add Syedna to the names of Sahabas (RA) and Prophets (AS). I though Syed was used only by the family (children) of Rasool SW.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy family name is Syed as well and I do not know if I am the descendant of Rasool SA or my forefathers just added Syed to the name. My parents do not know that either. Should I remove Syed from my name or continue using it?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe word, Sayyed, is an Arabic word meaning master, leader, employer, etc.\n\nThe word Sayyed as a prefix or suffix to one's name generally implies to be\na descendant of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). However, that is\nnot a principle. If you do not know being a descendant of Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), you should research that. Nevertheless, there\nis no prohibition in your family name being 'Syed' and you do not have to\nremove that identity.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
