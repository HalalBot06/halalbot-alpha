  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\ni want to ask that can we join or go to the event of BARAILVI SECT, 2ndly plzzz give me the information about these BARAILVIS,what beliefs do they have which are wrong.\n\nin our university they are very actively pulling the boys who are not familiar with them,but alhamdulillah we are also in very big quantity with the grace of allah and tabligh.\n\nwhat about there literature,coz they write more about the BUZARGS not abt SAHABAS OR NABI S.A.W\n\nSHOULD WE AVOID THEM ,OR WHAT TO DO???\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nBareli is a name of a place in the UP area in India. Moulana Ahmed Raza Khan is from this area, hence he, his teachings and his followers, are attributed to this place.\n\n(Mutala Bareilwiyat Pg.19 Vol.1 Darul Maarif)\n\nWe disagree with some of his beliefs.\n\nSome of the beliefs of Moulana Ahmed Raza Khan are:\n\n1.                    Rasullullah (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasalam) had the knowledge of the unseen\n\n(Nizamul Fatawa,Vol.1,Pg.177,Deoband) [1]\n\n\n\n\n\n2.       That the Aayat “He is the first and the last and, he has power over everything and knows everything”, was referring to the being of Rasullullah (Sallahallahu alaihi wasalam).[2]\n\n \n\n(Sura Hadeed, Verse 4)\n\n3.      It was possible that Rasullullah (Sallahallahu alaihi wasalam) could have forgotten some of the Aayat of the Quraan (aliyaazu billah).\n\n(Nizamul Fatawa,Vol.1,Pg.177,Deoband)[3]\n\n \n\n4.  Help can be sought directly from the late Hazrat Shaikh Abdul Qaadir Jailani (Rahimahullah) (not as a medium to Allah Taa`la but that, Abdul Qaadir Jaailani (Rahimahullah) can directly grant help. )\n\n(Nizamul Fatawa Pg.179,Vol 1,Deoband)[4]\n\n \n\n       5.         Rasullullah (Sallahallahu alaihi wasalam) is Omni-present. (Haazir Naazir).\n\n \n\n(Nizaamul Fatawa Pg.195 Vol.1 Deoband)\n\nAll of the above are incorrect beliefs.\n\nIt is not proper for one to attend the functions of the Barelvi`s.\n\n \n\n \n\nWe would advise you to abstain from engaging in debating and arguing with the Barelvi`s as this will lead to an exchange of harsh words and ill feelings. Rather one should speak with kind words and wisdom. Allah Taa`la had commanded Rasullullah (Sallahallahu alaihi wasalam) to speak with kind words and wisdom in the Quraan\n\n(Oh Muhammad Salallahu Alaihi wasalam) Call towards the path of your lord with wisdom and good admonishment.\n\n (Sura Anahal V.125)\n\nSo likewise, we should call others towards the straight path with wisdom and kind words.\n\nIt is also very important that we make Dua that Allah Taa`la that guides them (Barelvi`s) to the straight path. Aameen\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl. Muhammed Sindhi,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā\n\n\n\n\n[1] .فانه يدعي ان الرسول يعلم كل المغيبات علما تفصيليا من الازل الى الابد ...\n\n\n\n[2]  هو الاول و الاخر و الظاهر و الباطن و هو على كل شيْ قدير (الحديد 3)\n\n[3] انظر نظام الفتاوى ج.1 ص177, ((و يمكن نسيان بعض الايات منه عليه الصلاة و السلام))\n\n[4] انظر نظام الفتاوى ج.1 ص.179, و من خرافته انه يعتقد ان الشيخ عبد القادر الجيلاني مستغاث كبير فى العالم."
