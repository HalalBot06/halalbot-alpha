  "question": "Mcdonald fries if they are fried in a separate oil pan and separate utensils are used with barely no contamination. Are they halal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShari'ah has emphasised on exercising precaution in Halaal and Haraam. If any outlet sells Haraam items as well, one should abstain as such an outlet\ncannot be trusted.\n\nIf the outlet sells only Halaal and is supervised by a trustworthy Muslim, then one may eat from there.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
