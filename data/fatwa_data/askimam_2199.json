  "question": "Regarding the 72 sects, are they worse than the kuffar also?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy friend had read in a book called \" Sunni Bahisti Zewar \" a hadith, which was compiled by Imam Bayhaqi, that said that the 72 sects that are going to Hell are worse than anything in this whole universe. Although i do not remember the whole hadith, i hope you know of it. What i would like to know, is that are these 72 sects worse than the kuffar? Eg: Shias? Also, if a shia asks us for help, are we allowed to help him, eg: in studies, etc.?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDeviated sects of Islam are worse than non-Muslim as they (deviated sects)\nclaim to be true Muslims, thus, misleading many sincere people.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
