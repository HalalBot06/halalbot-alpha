  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n  Is it allowed to think that, other people should get whatever they need?\nI am a software engineer. If I am thinking that other people should also get high level knowledge what I like to get, is it a sin or a good thing?\nIf I am going for a test or exam, I am thinking that everyone should pass the exam and should get the job, is there any problem in this thinking or is it a good deed?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nWe make dua that Allah Ta’ala makes you successful in your studies and exams. Ameen  \n\nIt is part of the perfection of a person’s iman that he desires for others what he desires for himself. Nabi صلى الله عليه وسلم has mentioned:\n\n \n\nلا يومن احدكم حتى يحب لاخيه ما يحب لنفسه (متفق عليه)\n\nNone can have perfect iman unless he desires for his brother that which he desires for himself. (Bukhari, Muslim)\n\n \n\nHowever, you should bear in mind that secular education is just a means of income and its benefits are until this world. You should not be overwhelmed with any worldly benefit and give preference to it over Deeni and religious benefits. More important than secular education is Deeni education which is a means to obey Allah Ta’ala and its benefits are beyond this world.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\nMl.
