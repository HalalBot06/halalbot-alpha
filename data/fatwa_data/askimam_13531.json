  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy husband is a terribly selfish man - and only thinks about his own comfort.\n\n His selfishness is only matched by his anger - his use of foul language is just horrible. I have given him nasiha over and over again and he promises to stop, but once his anger surfaces over the pettiest of things, he loses self control. Is there an amal that I can do on his behalf? It is sliding me into darkness and having a negative effect on my children.\n\nMay Allah swt bless your efforts.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nPlease note this site is dedicated only to Fiqh questions.\n\nSister we are sad to know about your husband’s bad character. If a person cannot control himself or reform himself, he should seek the assistance of a spiritual guide who is Allah fearing and who strictly adheres to Shariah. If such a person is identified, and your husband adheres to the advises given by his spiritual mentor, he will benefit tremendously. In the absence of that, he will remain as he is and may even get worse as the years go by. We make dua that that does not happen. Your husband may also communicate with us directly. We will assist him.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
