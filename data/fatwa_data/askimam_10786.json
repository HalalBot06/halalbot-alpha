  "question": "Is it recommended to offer animal sacrifice on behalf of Prophet Muhammad s.a.w.s? Can we offer animal sacrifice on behalf of our deceased relatives? Can we do 1 sacrifice on behalf of all deceased?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease provide the related Hadith for the first question. For the third question, can we do a single sacrifice and request Allah s.w.t. to forward the Sawaab to all our Marhoomeen or do we need to do one sacrifice for each relative? Would this Isaal-e-Sawaab be any different than forwarding the reward for reading Qur?an or doing acts of charity? If so, why?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn principle, when offering Nafl Qurbaani, one may make one, two or multiple intentions.\n\nTherefore, if a Nafl sacrifice you intend for Rasulullah [Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam] and family members, it will be valid.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\nÂ \n\n2004-05-03"
