  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPls advise the manner of reciting qunoot e Naazilah, in the Fajr prayer, after Ruku of the second rakaat for both the Imaam and the followers. \n\n1. Must the Imaam raise his hands as in dua when he recites this or must it stay on his side.\n\n2. must the followers raise their hands in dua and say Ameen loud or Soft, or must they keep their hands on their sides and not say ameen\n\nShukran\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, Qunoot-e-nazila is recited only when the Muslims are faced with some calamities. Qunoot is not recited everyday in Fajr Salah as is the case in the other Madahib. If Qunoot-e-nazila is recited, the imam will not raise his hands. The followers will say Ameen upon the Dua being recited. The Ameen could be said aloud or soft. It is better to say amen softly.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
