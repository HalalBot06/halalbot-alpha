  "question": "Is bath valid by having a tub?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti, If one is in need of an obligatory ghusl due to janaabah would it be valid for one to simply lie in a tub of water whilst making sure that water reaches everywhere? Would the answer be the same if the obligatory ghusl is due to the termination of menstruation?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMadina 1420 years ago was very sparsely populated, a desert area with not%0D%0Amuch water available.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe best of creation, our Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) lived in this%0D%0Atown. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to use the water that was%0D%0Aavailable and with this have a complete Fardh bath. It has been estimated%0D%0Athat Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to use approximately 3 litres%0D%0Aof water for a bath. The method of our Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)'s%0D%0Abath was such that first he used to wash both hands to the wrist with the%0D%0Aintention of Ghusl. Thereafter, he used to wash both the private parts,%0D%0Acleaning all Najaasats. Wudhu should then follow this process. Thereafter,%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to pour water over his head thrice,%0D%0Afollowed by water being poured 3 times on the right side and then the left%0D%0Aside of the body.%0D%0A%0D%0ABy rubbing the body, while pouring water on the body every hair and every%0D%0Apart of the body would become wet with water.%0D%0A%0D%0AA tub (in general) is not 10 hand spans by 10 hand spans in area (regarded%0D%0Aas little water which becomes impure by impurity falling in it). Thus, water%0D%0Awould become impure if some impure substance enters that amount of water.%0D%0AHence, soaking in the tub would not render one pure. As regards the doubts%0D%0Aone experiences, it is just the evil whisper of Shaytaan. Read, 'A'oodhu%0D%0Abillah' 3 times before undressing and follow the Sunnat method of pouring%0D%0Awater and rubbing ensuring to cover every part of the body. If any doubt%0D%0Aoccurs thereafter, then disregard them. (Fataawa Mahmood vol.9 pg.46)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
