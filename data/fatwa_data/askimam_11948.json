  "question": "Please clarify whether the Imaams of Masjid-e-Haraam (Shuraim & Sudais) belong to Ahle Sunnah wal Jamaat. Which fiqh do they follow?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama'ah, that are found today, are made up of two groups viz. the Ashaa'irah and the Maatudridiyyah. The wahabis are classified as Ahlul Bidah and out of the Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaa'ah. (Al-Muhannad Pg.46).\n\nIn order to ascertain whether the Imams of the Haram are Wahabis or not, it will be necessary to enquire from them. It is not possible to pass a ruling without asking the person himself, unless he openly declares being a wahabi and not from the Ashaa'irah or Maaturidiyyah. As for their fiqh, some claim that they are ghair-muqallids while others say they are Hambalis. Here too, it will be necessary to enquire directly from them\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n1SOCIAL DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
