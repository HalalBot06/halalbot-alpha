  "question": "Should i break my Salaah to look after my crying baby?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have eight month old baby, some times due to her I would not be able to perform NAMAZ as ther will be no body at home & if i let her alone for NAMAZ she will start crying, what should I do in this condition. Some times it happens that when I am in NAMAZ she start crying at this time should I break my NAMAZ and look after her or should i continue to to pray?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nSurely you will not be by your baby all the time. You also engage in other activities; what do you do when your baby cries at that time? If the baby cries while performing salah shorten your salaah and complete it. Do not break your salah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai \n\nDarul Iftaa"
