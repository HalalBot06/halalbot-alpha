  "question": "Assalamwalaikum Eid salaat is waajib, so why do pilgrams not perform the Eid -ul Adha salaat during Haj? Jazakallah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakatuh\n\nThe Eid Salaah is not Waajib on Pilgrims because Mina does not fulfil the conditions for Eid Salaah to be held there. Furthermore most of the Pilgrims could be termed Musaafir, therefore not liable to perform Eid Salaah. For a Pilgrim, there are many important rituals to perform so he would be absolved of performing the Eid-ul-Adha Salaah.
