  "question": "Can a Muslim view a female unclothed?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for a male to see the entire body of a strange female (Ghayr Mahram with whom marriage is permissible). The above ruling excludes a wife as it is permissible for the husband to look at his wife being uncovered. However, that too should be avoided as it is against morality and shame. And Allah Ta'ala Knows Best Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
