  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would first like to commend the work that you are doing to help all the people out there who want to find out more about Islam.\n\nMy problem is quite confusing but I need some advice from you.\n\nI am a 20 year old girl who got married a year back. Alhamdhulillah everything was fine until my mother explained a situation to me. It seems as though my father is having an affair with my sister in law (my husbands sister).\n\nEven though she has no concrete evidence, we have all noticed it.I have confronted my father but he swore upon his mother he would never do something of that sort. I even confronted my husband but he denied it and told me that I haven’t been able to blend myself with his family.\n\nJust the other day I saw my father, my sister in law and my mother in law standing together and discussing something and as soon as they saw me approaching they got a little frightened. My father has told my mother a couple of times to leave home and go somewhere else. He even went as far as telling my sister that she and my brother should take up the responsibilities of the house. My brothers only 18 and my sister 22.\n\nIsn’t it his responsibility to get them married? I really don’t know what to do anymore as I am confused and is my nikkah with my husband valid if this is happening because it seems as though its been going on for quite sometime now.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\n \n\nThere is a misunderstanding between your mother and father.It is very important to address the problem and resolve it. If the actual problem is not diagnosed, it will lead to mare complications. The questions to ask are:\n\n \n\n1) Are there any problems between your mother and father?\n\n2) Is the suspicion the problem or this suspicion arose after some other problem.\n\n \n\nWe advise you consult with appropriate people and request their intervention in the matter. When appropriate people deal with the issue with diligence, the problem could be identified. This makes the solution identifiable.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
