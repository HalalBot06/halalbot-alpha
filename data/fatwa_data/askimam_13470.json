  "question": "Is it true that as per Islam- we should believe in Black Magic",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nRecently I came to know that somebody from my family did black magic on my mother. Is it true that as per Islam- we should believe in Black Magic. If yes ? How can we save ourselves against this kind of thing. Please suggest some Duaa or wajifa. So such kind of things can not affect us.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nBlack magic (Sihr) is a reality and is mentioned in the Qurâ€™aan and Hadith.\n\nHowever, it is surprising that you came to know who did black magic on your mother, who told you that? Many people err in on black magic and base their conclusions on assumptions? Be careful and guard against that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
