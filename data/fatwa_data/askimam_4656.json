  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTaqdeer is part of Imaan. It is our belief that everything occurs through%0D%0Athe will of Allah Ta'ala and that Allah Ta'ala has the total knowledge of%0D%0Awhat is going to happen. Allah Ta'ala is the Khaaliq (Creator) of actions%0D%0Aand man is the Kaasib (earner) of the actions. Allah Ta'ala created all%0D%0Aactions, be it evil or good, and then gave man the choice to choose one of%0D%0Athe two.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the Hadith, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) mentioned, 'There is no%0D%0Aperson from amongst you except that Allah Ta'ala has written (destined) his%0D%0Aabode in Jahannam and his abode in Jannah.' They (Sahaaba) asked, 'O'%0D%0ARasulullah, should we not put our trust on our books, i.e. what has been%0D%0Awritten for us. And leave out doing actions.' Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) replied, 'Carry on doing actions. Everything will be made easy for%0D%0Awhat it has been created for. As for those who are from the fortunate one's,%0D%0Athen the actions of the fortunate one's will be made easy for him and as for%0D%0Athose who are from the deprived one's, the actions of the deprived ones will%0D%0Abe made easy for him.' Then, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) recited the%0D%0AAayaat, 'As for those who give (Sadaqah) and adopted God-fear, we will make%0D%0Asmooth for him the path of ease.' (Mishkaat pg.20; Qadeemi)%0D%0A%0D%0ABelief in Taqdeer should not spur a person to do evil actions, for example,%0D%0Aa person making excuse of Taqdeer says, 'I will just sit and what Taqdeer is%0D%0Awritten for me will occur. I am not going to do anything.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThis is totally contrary to the teachings of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam). Rather, a person should adopt the plan and means to do something.%0D%0AThereafter, after the action has been done, the belief of Taqdeer comes in,%0D%0Athat whatever happened was through the will of Allah. (Islaahi Khutubaat;%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Taqi vol.7 pg.207)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn brief, Taqdeer refers to the Absolute knowledge of Allah Ta'ala of%0D%0Aeverything even before its existence. Since the knowledge of Allah is%0D%0Aperfect, everything will take place exactly according to His knowledge, but%0D%0Ain the case of human deeds, through the choice of the individual.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
