  "question": "Is it ok to call a person \"Azim\", or must one say \"AbdulAzim\" ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it ok to call a person \"Azim\", or must one say \"AbdulAzim\" ?\n\nCan you list out what are the Names should not be called seperately from 'Abdul'?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAzim means big. That is a relative issue. A person may be big in relation to one person and small in relation to another. Allah is Azim in relation to everything.\n\nAzim is not a sole attribute of Allah and can be used for a ‘big’ person as well. A sole attribute of Allah, for example, Rahman or Subhan should be preceded with the name Abdul which means slave. It is incorrect to name a person with the sole attribute of Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
