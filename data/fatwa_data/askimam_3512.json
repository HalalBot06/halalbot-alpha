  "question": "I got married recently. The problem is that I get wet easily while having foreplay with my wife and I do not have the energy to do ghusl everytime this happens. What should I do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhy has Islam made it hard for married couples to enjoy each other. After performing intercourse at night we get tired and fall asleep and also do not have the energy to make ghusl by taking a shower or bath. Therefore, we miss Fajr and just pray kaza in the morning. What should we do. Is it permissible to sleep on bed sheets that are a little dirty and still stay pure without having to do ghusl. Jazakallah Khairun\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the time of excitement (during foreplay), a fluid comes out. That is Mazi (pre-coital fluid). However, when one reaches climax and is satiated, the liquid which comes out at that time is called Mani (semen).\n\nGhusl becomes compulsory due to Mani and not due to Mazi. However, if one had intercourse with the wife, they do not have to bath immediately. They may sleep and perform Ghusl before Fajr Salaat. The linen on the bed does not have to be changed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
