  "question": "I know that women cannot wear a skirt but this palestinian work colleagues tella us that it is permissible.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPalestinian girl works with me and tells the kuffar colleagues that she will be going to chrismas party wearing knee lenght skirt..she says it is allowed....how do i tell her she is wrong?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe actions of this sister is definitely questionable from an Islamic point of view.\n\nFirstly, attending parties of the Kuffaar can never be regarded as permissible. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has said, ?Whosoever imitates a nation is from amongst them.? Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has also encouraged us to oppose the Kuffaar in their customs, rituals and habits, etc. By us attending such functions we will be showing our support rather than opposition to them.\n\nThe other aspect is of her dressing; wearing of knee length skirt in public for a woman is contrary to the teachings of the Shari?ah. A woman has to be covered from head to toe. This friend of yours should be encouraged to seek the correct guidance from the correct people.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
