  "question": "Assalaamu Alaykum. Could you help me with this question about Namaz?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen praying any type of namaz, after reciting surah al-fatiha. Then you can recite any surah from the quran. Do you have to recite them in the order they are in the quran or can you recite them in any order during each rakat? Jazak Allah khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen one performs Fardh Salaat, he may recite any Surah after Surah Faatiha.\nIn doing so, he should maintain a forward order of the Qur'aan, for example,\nif he recited Surah Kaafiroon, he may recite Surah Nasr, Falaq, etc.\nthereafter. He should not go backwards, for example, recite Surah Dhuha.\n\nIn Fardh Salaat, a follower (Muqtadi) cannot recite anything behind the\nImaam according to the Hanafi Madhab. It is advisable to follow the same\nprocedure in Sunnah and Nafl Salaats. However, there is flexibility in Nafl\nand Sunnah Salaats in the recitation order of Surahs - forward or backward.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
