  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy father invested in National Saving Scheme (http://www.savings.gov.pk/schemes.htm) according to which money is deposited for a fixed duration and depositor is paid fixed profit. Since long he has been depositing his earnings in this scheme and spending the money out of the profit for different needs in life. As inherited property from my father side, I will be given a house for living with my family. This property/house will be constructed from the money coming out of same scheme. Now please guide me (a) if it is ok for me to live and use that house. (b) If not, can this house be used for a purpose through which God forgives the sin which has been commited because of lack of awareness by us. \nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\nWe have checked the website regarding the National Saving Scheme and cannot rule on the Shariah compliancy of the scheme as the information on the website is too brief.\n\nWe have however noticed on the website that the NSS (National Saving Scheme) offers a prize bond. To be part of such a scheme is not permissible (Ahsanul Fatawa 7/26, Aap Ke Masaail 6/272, Jawahirul Fataawa 3/187, and Contemporary Fataawa 238)\n\nIf your father has invested into the above scheme, the dividends earned from NSS will not be regarded as Halaal. The dividends will have to be distributed to the poor and needy.\n\nThe capital amount will form part of the estate and distributed to the heirs. You may then use your share as you wish.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
