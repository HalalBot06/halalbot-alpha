  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYes, it is true. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?A person will be with whom he/she loves.?\n\nThis Hadith of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was said in the context of a person going to Jannat. However, it could refer to people of hell as well. Therefore, tv stars are generally non-Muslims who are heading straight to hell. We should not befriend them nor love them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
