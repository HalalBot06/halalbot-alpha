  "question": "Under what circumstances, if any, would it be permissable to recite only a part of an ayat of the Quran following Surah Fatiha in my salaat ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAlhamdulillah, I have managed to commit the whole of Surah Bakara to memory. I achieved this mainly by making it a habit to recite the ayats of this surah as part of my daily salaat. Now, ayat number 282, which begins with the words \"Ya ayyuhal lazina aamanu iza tada yantum bidayni ila ajala musamma....\" is the longest ayat in the Quran. Would it be sinful to recite only a part of this ayat in one rakaat and complete it , over the remaining rakaats ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible to read a lengthy verse in two Rakaats.\n\nIt is not advisable to do so especially in a Fardh Salat, it will however, be permissible. It will be better to recite a few short verses. However, in the Sunnats and Nawaafil, it will be permissible. (Shaami vol.1 pg.537)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
