  "question": "In what kind of way can't you imitate the kuffar? Guidelines concerning Muslim dress and behavior.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDress, behaviour, etc? If you say nothing can be the same, how about driving a car? using a computers? etc? Are males not allowed to wear jumpers, which the kuffar invented? I?m asking because growing a beard is done to distinguish from the kuffar.. but there are kuffar who trim their moustache and grow a beard as well.. and at the time of the Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) the non-Muslim Arabs had beards too, and dressed the same didn?t they?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSPECIAL GUIDELINES CONCERNING DRESS AND APPEARANCE%0D%0A%0D%0ABY HADRAT MAULANA ABRARUL HAQ SAHEB (of Hardoi)%0D%0AMy respected brother! I wish to draw your attention to a specific matter. We%0D%0Ahave testified that Allah Ta'ala is the One whom we worship. In other words%0D%0Athis means that there is no one greater than Him. He is our Master, our%0D%0ARuler, the Ruler of all rulers. In fact, He is the King of kings. Since%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala is our Master, Ruler and our King; then we are His slaves,%0D%0Aservants, and subjects.%0D%0A%0D%0AEvery department has its own uniform, appearance and mode of dress which%0D%0Adistinguishes one from the other. Look at the person working for the police%0D%0Adepartment or the post office. Every one recognises him from a distance. On%0D%0Aseeing the post man approaching, everyone turns towards him thinking that if%0D%0Ahe does not bring us any money, then there's the hope of receiving a letter.%0D%0AOn seeing the police man, everyone becomes scared and hopes that nothing is%0D%0Aamiss and wishes that he does not turn his attention towards him. These are%0D%0Aall effects of clothing and appearance. If any worker does not wear the%0D%0Auniform that is required of his work place, he will be regarded as an%0D%0Aoffender and dismissed from his job. In the same way, Allah Ta'ala has%0D%0Aspecified a special type of dress for His obedient and dutiful servants,%0D%0Ai.e. for the Muslims. By wearing such type of clothing, fear and respect is%0D%0Aput into the hearts of others. By wearing anything contrary to this, the%0D%0AMuslim becomes disliked and detestable in the eyes of Allah Ta'ala. In fact%0D%0Ahe is disgraced in the eyes of Allah Ta'ala. The result of this is that his%0D%0Arespect and self-honour gets wiped out and people also begin to regard him%0D%0Aas despicable and disgraceful, as is evident today.%0D%0A%0D%0ATo appear and dress strictly according to the Shariah, is therefore not only%0D%0Aour duty, but we are also responsible for our family members. Teach your%0D%0Afamily members the following matters with regards to their dress and%0D%0Aappearance, so that the children can be made to adhere to the dress and%0D%0Aappearance of the Shariah from the very beginning.%0D%0A1. Men are prohibited to cover their ankles. Special care has to be taken in%0D%0Athis regard when wearing trousers.%0D%0A2. It is also prohibited to expose the knees. Therefore, one should not wear%0D%0Aanything that is above the knees.%0D%0A3. One should not adopt the clothing and appearance which is associated with%0D%0Athe kuffaar or sinners. That is, by adopting such a type of appearance or%0D%0Aclothing whereby someone else may feel that he is identifying with the%0D%0Aclothing and appearance of a particular group or people. For example, to%0D%0Ahave western hair styles, to wear caps, coats and western style trousers, to%0D%0Ahave meals while sitting on chairs, to clip the beard when it is less than%0D%0Athe length of one fist, or to shave off the beard completely. All these%0D%0Athings are such, that it is necessary for every Muslim to abstain from them.%0D%0A%0D%0AJust as it is necessary for a police-man who does something wrong to seek%0D%0Apardon for his own good and his promotion; it is also necessary on every%0D%0AMuslim to repent for any wrong committed, so that he may be successful and%0D%0Arewarded. He should put his dress and appearance in order and choose the%0D%0AIslamic mode of dress for the future. One should ponder over the fact that%0D%0Ajust as he would detest wearing the scarf of a Muslim sister, how can he not%0D%0Adetest adopting the mode of dress and appearance of the kuffaar and%0D%0Atransgressors!!! If this is our condition, then we should understand well%0D%0Athat we do not have a proper sense in our heart, and that it is gone sick.%0D%0AJust as a person cannot perceive the stink of filth, we feel that there's%0D%0Asomething wrong with his senses. It is therefore necessary to get this%0D%0Acured.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe cure for this is that we should go and sit in the company of the pious,%0D%0Alisten to their talks, offer Salaat with Jamaat, and when the kitaab is read%0D%0Ain the musjid we should listen to it. In this way our heart will become%0D%0Asound, and we will begin to dislike evil deeds.%0D%0A%0D%0APublished by: MADRASAH ARABIA ISLAMIA (AZAADVILLE)%0D%0A%0D%0A"
