  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni have a question about divorce. i have asked lots of mufti about my divorce situation but some say that im divorce and some say that im not. so please tell me is it ok for us to live together according to the response that we r getting and we  leave  together. thank you\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWe do not know about your divorce situation and the conflicting Fatwas. Nevertheless, Nikah distinguishes between Halaal and Haraam. The relationship between a male and female before Nikah is Haraam. Upon the Nikah, the male and female are now husband and wife and relationship between them is permissible. Nikah is such a relationship that a strong doubtful situation regarding its validity is highly resented. If your husband issued you a divorce and if it is a situation that can be remedied, for example, the husband issued one Talaaq-e-Baain, then a reperformance of the Nikah should be conducted.\n\nIf there are conflicting Fatwas on a permanent divorce, then you should exercise precaution and not stay together if there is a strong cause to create a doubt.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
