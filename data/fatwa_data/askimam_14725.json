  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. There was a CD centre near my house. I got CD's from him on rent. Once I rented 3 CD's but did not return him. Two of them broke and i sold the third in fifty bucks. Now I have realized that i had done a bad deed. I tried to find that shopkeeper but he is no more in the city. Tell me the solution to this problem so that i am exonerated from this burden.   2. Who are mirzaes? What is there beleif? Is it permissible to keep any sort of relationship like freindship with a mirzae? 3. Why is there difference between the salaah of Ahl-e-hadees and Ahl-e-sunnah? How these differences have arised?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram Brother in Islam\n\n \n\n \n\nAssalamu alaukum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh\n\n \n\n \n\n1)If after exhausting all efforts,you still fail to locate the shopkeeper you will have to give the current value of the three CD’s in charity.You are also obliged to make tawbah and ask Allah Ta’ala to forgive you for this serious sin you have comitted as well as seek forgiveness on behalf of the shopkeeper.\n\n \n\n2)Mirzais are Kaafirs (Infidels).They are not muslims.They hold numerous corrupt beliefs which contradict the Qur’aan and Sunnah.One of their fundamental beliefs is that Gulam Ahmed Qadiyani was a prophet as he himself had claimed.This belief of theirs removes them completely from the fold of Islam as this is clear disbelief in the Qur’aan.Allah Ta’ala states in the Holy Qur’aan:\n\n“Muhammad (Sallallahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) is the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of Prophets.(The final Prophet).\n\nIt is not permissible to take a Mirzai as a personal friend,However it is permissible to conduct business transactions with a mirzai like any other Kaafir.\n\n \n\n3)Please clarify what is meant by Ahle Hadees in your question and in which aspects does their Salaah differ?.Amongst the Ahle Sunnah there exists differences in various aspects of Salaah.However the method of Salaah of all the four Mazhabs (Hanafi,Maliki,Shafi’ee and Hanbali) of the Ahle Sunnah are correct and established trough the Authenthic Sunnah.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala Knows Best.\n\n \n\nMl.Suhail Tarmahomed\n\nStudent: Darul Ifta\n\n \n\nChecked and approved:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
