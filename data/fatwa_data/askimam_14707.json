  "answer": "QUESTION\n\niam in a huge dilemma,i got married 2 weeks back to a muslim guy  in a mosque ,we knew each other for almost 4 years and his parents did not agree for our wedding,my husband refused to have a valimah party to announce our nikah.now he doesnt introduce me as his wife ,he says we should wait another 4 to 5 months to let people know about our nikah.i feel very hurt as iam in nikah with him why cant i be respected as his wife ,i hope ALLAH guides him.pls advise me if it is alright to keep the nikah secret.jazakallah\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram\n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\n \n\nRasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) advised to announce the Nikah. That is so everyone knows about the husband and wife relationship. To keep a Nikah secret is against announcing a Nikah. Why did you marry if your husband was not prepared to announce the marriage and openly regard you as his wife? Nevertheless, the secret Nikah is valid.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\nThe guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\nEducation and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\nIslam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\nWhen one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\nMuslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\nWe have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\nIf you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\nIf that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\nRasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit”.\n\n \n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
