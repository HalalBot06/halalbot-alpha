  "question": "In one of the answers to your questions, you mentioned the prevailing madhabi principle of only taking 'muttawatir' issues into aqeedah and not ahad.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy question is, Mufti sahab please explain in detail as to why is it that Khabar-ul-Ahad is not to be taken into the aqeedah matters but only used to derive ahkam shariah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAll the basic Aqaaid of Islam are mentioned in the Qur'aan itself, any need\nfor clarification being sufficed by the Ahaadith Mutaawaatir. Thus, leaving\nno real need for admission of Khabar Ahad matters of Aqaaid.\n\nThis is aside from the fact that Khabar Ahad, containing elements of doubt,\ncannot be used to define principles upon which the very fundamentals of\nImaan (belief) are based. Furthermore, Khabar Ahad, being open to difference\nof opinion, if admitted into such matters could weaken the very foundations\nof Aqaaid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
