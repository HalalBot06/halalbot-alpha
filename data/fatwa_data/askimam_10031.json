  "question": "To make up missed fasting (period, pregnancy) can I do it on the six days of Shawwal, Arafat or other special days of fast?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf yes - do I get double reward? Do I have to clarify the intentions, resp. declare them for both matters (missed fasting, intention to fast for arafat for example?)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOne may make up for the missed fasts on these days. The intention should be clearly that of missed fasts only. It is hoped, from the mercy of Allah Ta?ala, that one will receive the virtues of these special days as well.\n\nAs a general rule, one should try and complete all missed fasts as soon as possible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
