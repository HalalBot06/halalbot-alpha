  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni am female and would like to go for an Umrah Insha'Allah, this year. My parents and I have planned to go, and my Aunt (dads sister) and her husband will be coming with as well. In the event that my parents can not make it, may my Aunts husband stand as a Mahram for me?\n\nJazakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYour paternal aunty’s husband is a Ghayr Mahram to you. In principle, he could marry you. He is not your Mahram and you cannot travel with him without your Mahram.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
