  "question": "can we combine salat of [ Zuhr and asr] and [ maghrib and esha ] during travel as hadiths attached From Sahih Bukhari Volume 2, Book 20, Number 209",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nFrom Sahih Bukhari Volume 2, Book 20, Number 209: Narrated Salim's father: The Prophet used to offer the Maghrib and Isha' prayers together whenever he was in a hurry on a journey. Narrated Ibn Abbas: Allah's Apostle used to offer the Zuhr and 'Asr prayers together on journeys, and also used to offer the Maghrib and 'Isha' prayers together. Narrated Anas bin Malik: The Prophet used to offer the Maghrib and the 'Isha' prayers together on journeys. Volume 2, Book 20, Number 212: Narrated Anas bin Malik: Whenever the Prophet started a journey before noon, he used to delay the Zuhr prayer till the time of 'Asr and then offer them together; and if the sun declined (at noon) he used to offer the Zuhr prayer and then ride (for the journey).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, it is not permissible to join two Salaats in\none time. Every Salaat must be performed in its prescribed time.\n\nApparent joining of two Salaats is permissible, not real joining. Apparent\njoining is to, for example, delay Dhuhr Salaat until before its expiry time\nand perform Asr Salaat immediately upon Asr Salaat time setting in. the same\nmay be applied for Maghrib and Esha Salaats.\n\nThe above quoted Ahaadith may be understood according to the abovementioned\nexplanation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
