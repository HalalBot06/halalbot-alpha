  "question": "Could a woman call her husband by his name?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nBismillah Hirahmaan Niraheem Dear Alim, Could a woman call her husband by his name? Also, I heard that one should not call his/her father by his name. Is this true? I kindly request to list the persons, whom we should not call by his/her name? Jassakkallahu Khairun Khateeran. Warm Regards, Wassalam. Your loving brother\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for the child to address his father by his name as\nthat is disrespectful, which is Haraam (strictly prohibited). The\nrelationship between the husband and wife is not analogous to the\nrelationship between father and son. If in one's urf (environment)\naddressing the husband by his name is not regarded as disrespectful, then it\nwill not be disrespectful to call him by his name.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
