  "question": "Is it okay if a muslim girl wears hijab for few years, but later removes it due to objection from others?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nhi my sister has been wearing hijab for 3 years but has removed it because people make fun of her plus our parents do not like it. is it ok for her not to wear hijab anymore?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is the express law of Allah Ta?ala and His Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) for females to clothe themselves in a way that conceals their form and shape. It is also compulsory for a female to cover her hair.%0D%0A%0D%0AHijaab is not confined to covering only the hair, but the entire body. It is sad to note that your sister removed the Hijaab due to people around her mocking her. It is more sad to note that your parents are committing a sin. They are bound by the Shari?ah to nurture their daughter according to the laws of the Shari?ah. They should, in fact, encourage their daughters to don the Hijaab and support her. She should don the Hijaab of Allah or following it. Does she prefer breaks the laws of Allah Ta?ala or following it. Does she prefer the pleasure of people over the displeasure of Allah. Encourage your sister to don the Hijaab again. %0D%0A%0D%0AYou should also discuss the matter with your parents. Explain them the importance of Hijaab and upholding the laws of Allah Ta?ala.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
