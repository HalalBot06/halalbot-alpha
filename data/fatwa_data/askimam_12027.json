  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy native place is India. My wife and family also in India. I am working in Saudi Arabia. From here I had sent 1st talaq letter and I mentioned \"Muthalaq\" on that letter to my wife by force and with my anger. But I didn't say \"TALAQ\" directly to my wife. She finished her iddat (only 40 days she sit in iddat) after rcvng my first talaq letter and by Jamath committee(Local Muslim Committee) decision. Now i heard this is not proper \"TALAQ\". By force u did, So u have possibility to live again with her. But I had sent only frist \"TALAQ\" letter. Now we agree to each other. So, please advice me is there any possiblity to live again with her.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf you only gave her one Talaaq and not three, then it will be permissible for you to remarry and live as husband and wife. She will have to agree to it.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
