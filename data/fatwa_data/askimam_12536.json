  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs going to the stage of Mareyfat (spiritual state of Islam) the ultimate state of becoming a true muslim? Is it mandatory for every muslim to go to that state by following or being Murid (follower) of a peer( spiritual leader or saint)? Can anyone go to the path of Marefat without following/bypassing the basic law's of Sariat like 5-times paryer, fasting in Ramadan,Hajj etc. ? Are the persons practising Mareyfat or peers are exempted from the basic laws of Sariat? Did the persons like Hazrat Abdul Qadir Jilanne (R), Hazrat Khaja Moinuddinn Chisti (R) say regular paryers?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMa?rifat means the recognition of Almighty Allah. Every Muslim is duty bound to believe and recognise Allah through His creations. No Muslim is exempt from the Faraaidh (basic obligations), for example, 5 daily Salaat, etc.\n\nThe fulfilment of the basic Faraaidh is essential and a means of spiritual upliftment. No Muslim can traverse the path of spirituality without fulfilling the basic Faraaidh. Every Wali and saintly person strictly adhered to the Faraaidh. One can easily attain Wilaayat and closeness to Allah by adhering to the Faraaidh and abstaining from sins.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
