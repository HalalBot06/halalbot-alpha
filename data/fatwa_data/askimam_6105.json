  "question": "How to get involved in Islamic Ummah after conversion?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI converted to Islam about 6 months ago, I have been to a mosque only once even though there is a mosque across the street from where I work. I found that most muslims I meet, doubt my sincerity when they hear about my conversion (I am white) and treat me as if my conversion is only temporary. I pray the 5 prayers, I try to live according to Muslim law, I am not currently wearing hijab, but would like to do so soon. I would also like to go to mosque more regularly, but the attitude towards me is not only one of doubt, but it is almost like the people distance themselves from me for some reason. I would like to become more involved in an Islamic community (there are not that many muslims around the area I live in), but don't really know how to go about it. I have enquired about arabic classes but was told they are during the week in the mornings, when I am at work. What should I do, where should I go to become more involved, to learn more about Islam? I am reading a lot about Islam, the laws, principles, etc, but I think interacting with muslims would be ideal.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe are pleased to note that Allah guided you to the ultimate truth - Islam.\nMay Allah grant you strength and steadfastness, Aameen.\n\nAllah Ta'ala clearly states in the Qur'aan, 'Verily believing males (and\nfemales) are brothers (and sisters) respectively to one another.'
