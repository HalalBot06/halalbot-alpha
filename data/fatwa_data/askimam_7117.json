  "question": "Is it true that the prophet said u shudnt wear taweez’s bcoz u’ll rely on it to stop u from doing bad things when really u shud only ask allah to help u.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe wearing of Taweez is permissible but it is best to abstain since the Taweez tends to shift one?s focus of Tawakkul away from Allah Ta?ala.\n\nInitially, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) had prohibited the use of any form of Ruqyah (Taweez) due to the people?s ignorance and close contact with Shirk. He later on permitted the use of Ruqyah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
