  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Mufti As Salaamu Alykum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh Alhamdulillah I have given birth to a baby girl about 10 days ago. After a slight complication I had to undertake a `D and C (ie. a womb scrape).' Shukr by now my bleeding and all other emmisions have stopped totally. Can I now resume with my daily activities of Ibaadat like before or do I have to wait for the full 40 days to pass. Please advise me. Jazakumullah and may Allah Rabbul Izzat reward you all, Aameen.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMay Allah Ta'ala bless you and your child, Aameen.\n\nIn princople, the maximum period of Nifaas (bleeding after birth) is forty\ndays. There is no minimum period. Therefore, if your bleeding has stopped\nand you are almost certain that there will be no after birth bleeding, then\nyou should take a compulsory bath and resume your Shar'ee obligation of\nperforming your Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
