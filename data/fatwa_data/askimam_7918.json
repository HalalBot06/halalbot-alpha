  "answer": "QUESTION\ni love a guy! we love each other very much! what i like abt him is he is religious,as i have heard that the one who is religious will fear god and he will not do deeds that Allah wont like! And he will also take good care of his wife n family! But the thing is that my mum doesnt approve our love! As everyone know both the bride n the groom should agree heartfully to marry one another! He doesnt have much education! Does it matters?(anything said in Q'uran)! And my friend n her boyfriend are getting married next month! theirs also love marriage! their parents agree after some time! Actually my Boyfriend n i was e one who introduce them! With Allah's blessing,they are getting married next month! We are feeling a bit upset as our love has not approved yet! We are praying to Allah n askng him dua! Insha Allah,May HE unite us! Ameen! Please ask dua for us.Thanx! And please tell us about opinions n about anythings that had been said in Q'uran! Thanx\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Since you are an adult, you are permitted to marry even without the consent of your mum. She probably has a sound reason for withholding her blessing. We suggest you communicate your feelings to her and endervour to get her blessings.\n\n2. According to the words of the Qur?aan and Hadith, there is nothing like Nikah that engenders love between the spouses. You may feel that you love him tremendously but it could just be infatuation. Make a decision with your head and not your heart. Whatever the case is, your present relationship with him ? if any ? is prohibited. Cease all form of contact with him.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
