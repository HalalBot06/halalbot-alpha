  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy friend wishes to marry his cousin, but does not know if it’s allowed. The relation is his mother’s brother’s daughter’s daughter. Is this allowed?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nIt is permissible for him to marry her. Cousins and cousin’s children have not been mentioned in the Quran as unlawful for marriage. Allah Ta’ala says in the Quran:\n\n“Prohibited to you (For marriage) are: Your mothers, daughters, sisters, father's sisters, Mother's sisters, brother's daughters, sister's daughters, foster-mothers (Who gave you suck), foster-sisters, your wives' mothers, your step-daughters under your guardianship, born of your wives to whom ye have gone in,- no prohibition if ye have not gone in;- (Those who have been) wives of your sons proceeding from your loins; and two sisters in wedlock at one and the same time, except for what is past; for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful” (4:23)\n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\n \n\nMuftī Asif Umar\n\nWashington, DC (USA)\n\n \n\nConcurred by:\n\nMuftī Abrar Mirza\n\nChicago, IL (USA)\n\n \n\n\nUnder the Supervision of Muftī Ebrahim Desai (South Africa)\n\n \n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER – AskImam.org questions\nAskImam.org answers issues pertaining to Sharī’ah.
