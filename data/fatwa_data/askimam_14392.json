  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nmy question is what r the actual rights of a husband and what does if a husband says that i dont like my wife for no reason\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYou state that the husband says that he does not like the wife. This could be the reason for the lack of commitment in the marriage and disregard for the rights of his wife. The couple should sit together and try to iron out their differences. By them swallowing the suspicion will only breed hatred and animosity. It is for this reason psychologists suggest that it is healthy for spouse to have an argument as the issues are thrashed out and the hearts become light. If they cannot resolve their differences, they could seek the intervention of responsible elders who may assist them in this regard. Fighting for the fulfillment of rights will have absolutely no benefit. If one forgoes his/her right for their spouse and do not demand his/her right, the marriage will be a blessing and a source of peace and comfort. Otherwise, the house will be a misery which the spouses will dread to come to.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
