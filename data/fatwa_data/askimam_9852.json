  "question": "My sis failed in her college examination as our father was hospitalised at the time of her exams, marks, Tell me any duaa, so that her marks can increase",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nshe is very depressed now, she has applied for revaluation of marks, plz tell me any duaa so that her marks can increase\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for requesting assistance for your sister from the institute. %0D%0A%0D%0AInsha'allah your father has regained his health and is on his way to recovery. Brother, do ask your sister to put her reliance on Allah Ta'ala and suggest to her that she should not despair if her marks are not acceptable. Allah Ta'ala places all sorts of tests before us in different ways, not only to test our imaan, but also to help us to develop as individuals. Can you imagine, if one does not experience some difficulty or the other as one is developing how difficult it would be when a sudden crisis hits one later in love? Each difficulty helps one towards coping with life's many demands. %0D%0A%0D%0AAlhamdulillah, Allah Ta'ala does not place a burden on us more than we can bear. At the moment your sister may have feelings of failure, hopelessness and helplessness. She may feel that all her hard work has not reaped the rewards of her toiling night after night to gain good marks. By all means she should hope that a remark may bring her the grades she seeks. Tell her to go on pleading to Allah Ta'ala for success. However, she should avoid feelings of despondency and despair to overtake her. She should rather hand the matter over to Allah Ta'ala. If she does not get the higher grades, should attempt the exam again. Do support and encourage her as best you can and ask the family to remain supportive too. You may ask her to write to me if she wishes. %0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala grant her knowledge which is beneficial in this world and the hereafter and may He grant her success in her endeavors. Ameen. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A1SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
