Which all the other dressed such as the pant and shirt does not, i f u say that salwar kamize shows the body, then what are we supposed to wear, A salwar kamize covers a women 's body head to toe( including the hijaab) . of coures ,in some cases, if a women wear really tight cloths and iit shows, then , is still better than weraing pant and shirt\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Sister-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nMerely covering the body is not sufficient to fulfil the requirements of Hijaab. The purpose of Hijaab is also to conceal the form and shape of the body and to avoid the lustful glances of males which may be caused by the attractive colours of the Shalwar and Kamees.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
