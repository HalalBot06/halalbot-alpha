  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is the solution if husbands income is totally based on riba.\nMy sister has tried her best to change him but after 10 years of effort have given up.  She is  ready to take any step in life.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n \n\nThe statement you have mentioned, “husband’s income is totally based on riba” is ambiguous. We understand, since you have used the word income, that you are referring to the fact that he is employed by a bank or other institution, which deals in interest-bearing transactions. If our understanding is correct, then it will be permissible for the wife and other dependents to partake of the food and utilize items purchased by the husband with such proceeds. (Fatāwā Mahmūdiyyah, vol. 18 pg. 412, Fārūqiyyah)\n\nو كذا لو اشترى لها طعاما أو كسوة من مال ليس أصله بطيب فهي في سعة من تناول ذلك الطعام\n\nو الثياب و يكون الإثم على الزوج\n(خانية ج4 ص 364 مكتبة حقانية كما نقل عن فتاوى محمودية  ج 18 ص 412 فاروقية)\n\nIn this scenario, the husband will be sinful for assisting the bank etc in the sin of ribā and his earnings will be harām. However, his earnings will not be considered inherently harām; rather, it will be extrinsically harām due to his assistance in vice. Thus, the husband alone will bear the burden of his disobedience. On the contrary, this concession to the wife etc. will not apply if the wealth is intrinsically harām e.g. money procured through bribery, theft or personally charging a debtor interest etc. In the examples of intrinsically harām wealth, the money actually belongs to other owners and must be returned to them. In the case of being employed by a bank, the husband is being remunerated for his services, albeit an impermissible action and assistance in sin, it will not be intrinsically harām.\n\nBearing the above in mind, we would encourage the wife to continue her efforts in persuading her husband to abandon his harām employment. She must be very dedicated, sincere and diplomatic in her approach. Merely informing the husband that his employment is harām and that he is being sinful will not suffice. She should be very tactful and wise in her approach. She should try to employ a more caring and loving approach with the husband. Before any person accepts advice, his or her heart must first be softened. Then and only then will it be prepared to accept the advice. Merely telling him or her of his or her wrongs will generally lead to justifying oneself and making excuses for the wrong. It is also important to bear in mind that no one changes over night and that it will take some time. Therefore, she should be diligent in exercising patience with her husband.\n\nAnother vital element for successful counseling is fervent and earnest du‘ā for the person being counseled. She should make du‘ā after every fard salāh, during the last portion of the night and after any other good deed for her husband. Sincere and compassionate counsel coupled with fervent du‘ā was the noble habit of Rasūlullah صلى الله عليه و سلم  and it has proven to be extremely beneficial and effective.\n\nWe also make du‘ā that Allah Ta‘ālā grant your sister’s husband that ability and determination to find another form of work. Amīn.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Yusuf bin Yaqub,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
