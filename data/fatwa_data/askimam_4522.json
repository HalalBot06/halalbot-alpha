  "question": "What are Durood-e-Taj, Lakhi, and Akbar? What is Haikul?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n[All these appear in the \"Panj Surah\" from India/Pak.] Where and how did these originate? Should these be recited?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThese forms of Durood are not based on any Hadith. While the wordings may\nbe correct; erroneous and over exadurated virtues are attached to some of\nthese Duroods. It is thus best to confine oneself to the forms of Durood\nfound in the Ahaadith. An example of the correct forms of Durood is the\nforty Durood compiled by Hazrat Maulana Muhammad Zakariyya R.A.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
