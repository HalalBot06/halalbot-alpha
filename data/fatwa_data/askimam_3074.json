  "question": "Can we use media for Dawa purpose? Why Tableegh Jamat is not using Media and they also oppose to use it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, there is no harm in using the media for Da'wah purposes\nprovided the rules of the Shari'ah are not contravened. The current modus\noperandi of the Tablighi Jamaat is in fact closer to the Sunnah and experience has shown it to be more effective.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
