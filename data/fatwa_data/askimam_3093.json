  "question": "My wife is pregnant. .. can a male administer the epidural? If so, how should she conduct herself at that time?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAlhamdulillah, she has been consulting a female doctor. However, if a female is not available to administer the epidural, can a male administer the epidural? If so, how should she conduct herself at that time?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for a male physician to administer the epidural injection. However, it may be helpful to request to the staff and her OBY-GYN doctor to first prepare your wife to receive the epidural by covering her in hospital sheets etc., leaving only that area of the body (a small window) to receive the epidural. As a further precaution, you may ask to be present during the procedure.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
