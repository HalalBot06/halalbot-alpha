  "answer": "QUESTION\nI worked in the office which is 1 to 1-1/2 km away from the Mosque. I manage to get break for Jumma prayer for half an hour only. When I reach the Mosque, Qutba has already been started. So, I have no time to read the 4 Rakaat Sunnat before Fard Jumma Salaat. 1. When should I read it -- should I read it immediately after 2 Rakaat Fard or after I complete the Jumma salaat, that is 2 Rakaat Fard, 4 Rakaat sunnat, 2 Rakaat Sunnat, and 2 Rakaat Nafil? 2. Will I get benefti of Jumma prayer because I reach the Mosque late. 3. Due to the tight schedule, I find it difficult to perform all the Jumma salaat in the Mosque in this half an hour break. Will it be okay if I read only Fard Jumma Salaat in the Mosque and the remaining salaat at home. My office time is from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Jumma prayer time is from 1:30 to 2 p.m. I reach at home at 3:30 p.m. Can I read the remaining Salaat at home? Thank you for your answer. May Allah give you a higher and higher place in Jannat.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. On the day of Jumu?ah we should be present for the Salaat as early as possible. There are many virtues reported for this in the Ahaadith. You should request for more time from the management and you should explain to them about it.\n\n2. You may read the 4 Rakaat Sunnat before the Fardh Salaat immediately after the 2 Rakaat Fardh or after the 4 Rakaat Sunnat of Jumu?ah.\n\n3. The Sunnat of Muakkadah should always be performed. If it is difficult to perform all Jumu?ah Salaat in the Musjid in this half an hour break, then in this case you can perform the remaining Salaat before the time expires because Qadhaa of Sunnat is permissible within the Salaat time.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
