  "question": "I heard that there is a small minority of hanafis in the hijaz region",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMakkah, medinah , Jeddah , and taif. Is this true ? I have also heard that there is a hanafi ulama in makkah . Could you tell me what countries follow the hanafi madhab. Was Abu Hanifah R.A in the company of sahaba ? Can you recite fatiha in your head to yourself without moving your tongue when your behind an imam. Because not doing anything but standing breaks my concentration. Also why do hanafis pray a different asr ,and why don?t hanafis make more than one takbir? Also how many rakats of tarawih are prayed in makkah. Do you know of any alims and muftis in Saudi Arabia. How can I contact them.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Yes, there is a small minority of Hanafis in Hijaaz.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Moulana Abdul-Hafiz Makki Saheb.%0D%0A%0A%0D%0A3. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Syria, Iraq.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Imaam Abu Hanifa (RA) met at least four Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum). One is Hadhrat Anas (Radhiallaahu Anhu).%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Yes, you can read Surah Faatiha in your heart.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. Imaam Abu Hanifa (RA) says Asr can be read once the shadow of an object becomes twice its length excluding the shadow at the time of Zawaal. Imam Shaafi?ee (RA) says Asr can be read when the shadow of an object becomes once its size. So, the Hanafis Asr is later than the Shaafi?ee Asr. Both Imaams have their proofs.%0D%0A%0D%0A7. Abu Hanifa (RA) says A Muaallee must only lift his hand once in the beginning of Salaat because of the Sahih Hadith of Abdullah ibn Mas?ood (Radhiallaahu Anhu). Imaam Shaafi?ee says the Musallee should lift his hands and make Takbeer even before Ruku and after. Both Imaams have their proofs.%0D%0A%0D%0A8. 20 Rakaats of Taraaweeh are prayed in the Haram of Makkah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
