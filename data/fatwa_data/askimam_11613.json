  "question": "Can we use a Grave Marker to identify our loved one’s grave, and also to signify that this spot belongs to someone, so that it’s not dug up again? How to place it, and what to be inscribed?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome people place is vertically, while others horizontally. One also observes all kinds of inscriptions, engraving and carving on these, some in Arabic. The visitors to the graveyard accidentally step on these all the time. Is this allowed?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible to use the grave marker for identification purposes. You\nmay write on it the deceased's name and date of death only. You should not\nwrite any Qur'aan or poem on it. (Shaami vol.2 pg.237)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
