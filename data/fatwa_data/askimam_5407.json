  "answer": "QUESTION\nDo the soul think about what is happening to them? Could the soul of my Mother be waiting and disturbed about us? please give me the answer I am so worried.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari'ah, once the soul (Rooh) leaves the body after death,\nin the case of a believer, his Rooh is preserved in a sacred place called\nIlliyyeen. In the case of non-believer, his soul is placed in the Sijjeen.\n\nIt is possible the deceased is aware of the actions and deeds of the living.\nThat is so if Allah wills.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
