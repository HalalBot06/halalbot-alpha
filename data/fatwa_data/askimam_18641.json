  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni want to know that is it haram tu eat if your pubic hairs are large then a wheat grain? 2)is it haram and sin to toch books and eat if you have no ghusal or mastured? 3)what are the limitations of islam about study of women?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\n1.) It is preferable to remove the pubic hair, hair of the arm-pits, nails, to have a bath and cleanse oneself at least once a weak. It is best to do all this on a Friday before going for the Friday salah. If one cannot do this on a weekly basis, he should carry it out every fortnight. If not, at least every forty days. There is no concession beyond forty days. If forty days expire and the person does not carry out the above, he will be committing a sin.1\n\n \n\n2.) If one upon whom ghusl is obligatory, wishes to eat or drink something before taking a bath, he should first wash his hands and face and gargle his mouth. Then he may eat and drink. If he does not wash his hands and face there is no sin on him.2\n\n \n\nIt is haram for one on whom ghusl is obligatory to touch the Quran. Touching books of tafsir (commentaries of the Quran) in that state is makruh.3\n\n \n\nPlease note: Discharging the seminal fluid with the hand is not permissible and a sin.4\n\n \n\n3.) Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi has written an exhaustive article called “The Education of Women” in his book Bahisti Zewar – a few excerpts here are as follows:\n\n \n\n*There is a sahih hadith “Seeking knowledge is fardh (compulsory) on ever Muslim” (male or female)\n\n*From the Shariah point of view, that when it comes to education, men and women are equal. If sinning is evil and worthy of condemnation for women, then its the same thing for men. And if education is a cause of chastity and honor for men then in the same way it is also for women.\n\n*The best method for girls is that two or three of them from amongst the relatives should get together and study. A female teacher should be appointed to teach them. If no female teacher is available then the men of the house should teach them.\n\n*Syllabus: Learning to read the Quran correctly, then religious books, proper Islamic books in English or Urdu according to the language. After completing the basic course, if the student wishes to learn more advanced Islamic studies in the student she can start learning Arabic and so on.5\n\n \n\nIn short – women can safely and easily learn from home and progress in both their religious and secular studies.\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl.
