  "answer": "QUESTION\nSpecifically an agency for the Dept. of Defense named Defense Contract Management Agency. My job Title is Contract Administrator and I basically resolve contractual problems that the Defense Contractor has (Such as payment problems). Since I'm basically indirectly helping the military arsenal of a Kafir country (who is at war with Darul Islam), is my job HALAL? Please Mufti saab, I want a definite answer, Haram or Halal?
