  "question": "What to with Dreams ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs slamu Alykum, What should one do when saw a bad dream? What should be done when one sees a good dream? Sometime one dream has some bad portion and good portion as well. What should be done in this case? In all three case, I am looking for answers like changing sides, spitting, reciting of dua etc, telling the dream to some one and best timing to tell the dreams etc. Jazakallahu Khairun\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Reality of Dreams%0D%0A%0D%0AQaadhi Thanaullah Panipati (RA) mentions in Tafseer Mazhari, 'The images%0D%0Aseen in sleep are known as dreams.'%0D%0A%0D%0ADreams are messengers from the unknown, voices from our collective%0D%0Asubconscious, warners of deep inner disturbance in the individual psyche,%0D%0Abearing glad tidings of good things to come or echoes of happiness or%0D%0Asadness and long hidden memories. Some dreams belong to the domain of%0D%0Apersonal experience and some are prophetic voices of the future. They are a%0D%0Auniversal phenomenon. Hence, the art of interpretations is a science known%0D%0Ato selected and gifted individuals.%0D%0A%0D%0ADreams are of 3 types:%0D%0Aa) Images of incidents which transpired in real life%0D%0Ab) Frightening images indoctrinated by Shaytaan.%0D%0Ac) Dreams in which Allah Ta'ala opens the unseen to the heart. This is a%0D%0Atrue dream.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above 2 types of dreams are false dreams.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllaamah Aloosi (RA), the mufti of Baghdad, explaining the reality and%0D%0Aessence of dreams says, Allah Ta'ala creates in the heart of a sleeping%0D%0Aperson certain thoughts or images as he does to the heart of a conscious%0D%0Aperson. Allah then makes these thoughts or images signs to event which He%0D%0Awill create in future.%0D%0A%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Nothing remains of prophethood but%0D%0Aglad tidings.' The companions asked, 'What are gladtidings?' Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Pleasant true dreams'. True dreams%0D%0Aconstitute a portion of the knowledge and fundamental make-up of Nubuwwat%0D%0A(prophethood), hence, generally the more resemblance a person has with%0D%0Aprophethood by his actions, speech, piety, knowledge and character,%0D%0Aaccordingly, his dreams will also generally be true.%0D%0A%0D%0ADreams are most potent during the latter part of the night, during siesta,%0D%0Aduring the time and during the fruit ripening season. This is probably,%0D%0Abased on the Hadith, 'When the time till draw near, the dreams of a Mu'min%0D%0Awill not be false.' Ulama has interpreted this to also mean, 'the night and%0D%0Aday being equal in duration and the abovementioned normally occurs when the%0D%0Aday and night are equal in duration.%0D%0A%0D%0AUlama mention certain etiquettes of dreams, derived from the Ahaadith. Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has stated, 'He should not narrate it to%0D%0Aanyone'. It should be narrated to a beloved and intelligent person. Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'The dream is like a string suspended on%0D%0Athe feet of a bird, as long as it is not related to anyone, the moment it is%0D%0Anarrated, it will transpire.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIf a person sees an evil dream, he should; a) Spit lightly 3 times to the%0D%0Aleft side, b) Change the side on which he was sleeping, c) Perform 2 Rakaats%0D%0Aof Salaat seeking protection."
