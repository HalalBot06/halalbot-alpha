  "answer": "QUESTION\nI ran over a cat (stray cat) in my neiborhood. I tricked the cat and it came under my wheel, so it was not completely accidental. My intention was not to run over the cat or kill it, but to scare the cat. I felt bad after the cat died because of my car running over it. The cat was not a pet cat but a stray cat and kind of annoyence in the neibourhood, but I never tried to kill before or call animal control over them as I felt Allah SWAT is their sustainer. Let me know what tauba I need to do. I already gave about 10 dollars sadaqah. Is it enough?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe cat is a creation of Allah Taâ€™ala. He put life and feelings in the cat. If you could not respect the life and feelings of the cat, you should not have harmed the cat. There was no reason for you to have tricked and killed the cat because of it being stray and annoyance to the neighbourhood. You could have contacted the animal control who would have taken control of the cat.\n\nYou have committed a sin for which you seem to have some regret. That is not enough. You should honestly take full responsibility of your wrong act and deeply regret the wrong. Do not justify your wrong in any way. Fear Allah and make sincere Tawbah. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] explained about a woman being punished by Allah because she was cruel to a cat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
