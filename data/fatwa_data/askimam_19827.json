  "question": "I am having a lot of bad thoughts, what should I do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am having problem of bad thoughts every 5 minutes. I tried my best to stop it but it doesn’t. Sometimes the bad thoughts come about Allah Ta’ālā. I wanted to ask having bad thoughts about Allah does it make a Muslim a disbeliever? What solutions are there to get rid of it?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nThoughts are of two types, voluntary and involuntary. One should not introduce evil thoughts in the mind. This could be done through exposing the mind to things which develop bad thoughts. For example one should be careful of the material one reads or sees. A bad read or an impermissible sight will develop evil thoughts. \n\nIf one experiences involuntary bad thoughts then one should ignore them. This is done by conditioning the mind. Think of a highway, whilst driving one is concerned about the road ahead and does not give any significance to the traffic that surrounds oneself. In the world of thoughts one should “drive” pass these involuntary thoughts and pay attention to the work or occupation that is before oneself. Another example is a livewire, if you ignore the live wire it remains harmless but no sooner you interfere with it then it harms you.\n\nYour problem is not a new one. It is an old plot from the tricks of shaitan. Shaitan wants to distract you by arresting your attention. The Sahabah radiyallāhu ‘anhum once complained to Nabi about thoughts of a similar nature; \n\nعَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، قَالَ: جَاءَ نَاسٌ مِنْ أَصْحَابِ النَّبِيِّ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ، فَسَأَلُوهُ: إِنَّا نَجِدُ فِي أَنْفُسِنَا مَا يَتَعَاظَمُ أَحَدُنَا أَنْ يَتَكَلَّمَ بِهِ، قَالَ: وَقَدْ وَجَدْتُمُوهُ؟ قَالُوا: نَعَمْ، قَالَ: ذَاكَ صَرِيحُ الْإِيمَانِ\n\nAbu Hurairah reports, some companions of Nabi came and they said, “Verily we have such thought that which we regard speaking about it to be a heinous act.” Nabi said, “Do you really have such thought?” they replied, “yes” he replied, “That is a clear sign of your belief.”\n\n(Sahih Muslim vol.1 pg.191; Dar Ihya Turath)\n\nFrom the above Hadith it is understood such thoughts are not abnormal for those who have true faith. A thief looks to commit theft only in places which have some goods of value. Shaitan will launch an attack on the hearts of those who have true Iman.  \n\nWhen these thoughts come recite Ta’awudh;\n\nأَعُوذُ بِاللَّهِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ\n\nAlso recite;\n\nلَا حول وَلَا قُوَّة إِلَّا بِاللَّه الْعلي الْعَظِيم\n\n \n\nAnd busy yourself with other work to keep your mind preoccupied from these type of thoughts. \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Ali bin Cassim\n\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nLos Angeles, CA (USA)\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
