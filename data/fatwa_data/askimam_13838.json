  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWe read in the selectio hadith of Muslim compiled by Imam Mundziri that once Rasulullaah owned a land and Abu Bakar insisted that the land will only be distributed to the ummahatul mu’minin not to his daughter / son. Fatimah got upset, so he did not speak to Abu Bakar up to her death.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAfter Faatima [radhiallaahu anha] realized the ruling pertaining to the Prophet’s inheritance, she never spoke to Abu Bakr [radhiallaahu anhu] regarding it (inheritance) for the rest of her life.
