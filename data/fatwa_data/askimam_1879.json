  "question": "Please advise how I can calculate 2.5% on gold jewellery as some were gifts and the rest I purchased.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSince my marriage I have, through gifts and my own purchases, an amount of gold which I do not believe to be worth more than Â£1500. I was told that Zakaat was not payable on items of personal use, however now that I realise that it is payable how can I calculate the zakaat?Do I need to take the items to a jeweller? I would like to avoid going to a jeweller if at all possible. Also is zakaat payable on the money obtained if and when gold is subsequently sold? May Allah reward you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi school of thought, there is Zakaat on gold and\nsilver jewelry if it is equivalent to the value of nisaab (minimum zakatable\nwealth) and after it was in your position for at least one year. Since you\nare in England, we advise you contact Mufti Ismail Kacholvi of Darul Ifta\nwal Irshad to assist you in calculating the jewelry according to the local\ncurrency. He may be contacted at 71 Fairbank Rd., Girlington, Bradford,\nEngland BD89\nTel. And Fax 01274 822538\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
