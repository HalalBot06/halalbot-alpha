  "question": "When I am indoors by myself or with my husband, is it necessary for me to cover my head",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhen I am indoors by myself or with my husaband, is it necessary for me to cover my head.\n\nAs someone has told me there are two angels watching me and satan is with me aswell and i must keep my head covered at all times eve when there are no other males present. Is this true? Secondly am I allowed to work. My husband works but we remain overdrawn which forces us to pay onterest. If I work then we no longer will have to pay interest as the income will be enough. Thirdly, if we live in the UK are we allowed to obtain a mortgage for our main residence. Someone said it is OK for your main residence but not for any further property purchases such as a second property to rent out etc.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. If you are alone with your husband then you do not have to cover your head. However, it is advisable to have your head covered even if you are alone with your husband. It is true that every one has angels around him/her. The angels should be respected.\n\n2. If your husband’s income is sufficient to fulfil the needs of the family, then it is not permissible for you to work.\n\n3. It is not permissible to take out an interest bearing loan (mortgage) even if it is for the one main house.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
