  "answer": "QUESTION\nThere is always a discussion of Eid e milad un nabbi sallalahou alehi wasalam. Few days ago i have recieved an email which i paste in the end. I just want to give a detailed reply on that but with intention of tabligh not a fighting over & over again. Are the explanation in the email are right in context to the issue?\nA Riwayat of Hadhrat Abdullah ibne Abbas(razi allah talah anhum) is correct?\n\ndo reply me\n\nJazzak Allah Kahiarin\n\nThe email:\n\n                                                                           Allah Said: Rejoice in the Prophet\nTo express happiness for the Prophet coming to us is an obligation given by Allah through Qur'an, as Allah said in Qur'an: \"Of the favor and mercy of Allah let them rejoice\" (Yunus 58).\nThis order came because joy makes the heart grateful for the mercy of Allah. And What greater mercy did Allah give than the Prophet himself, of whom Allah says, \"We did not send you except as a mercy to human beings\" (Al-Anbiya' 107).\nBecause the Prophet was sent as a mercy to all mankind, it is incumbent not only upon Muslims, but upon all human beings to rejoice in his person. Unfortunately, today it is some Muslims who are foremost in rejecting Allah's order to rejoice in His Prophet.\n                                                                 Allah Said: Invoke Blessings on the Prophet\nRemembrance of the birth of the Prophet encourages us to pray on the Prophet and to praise him, which is an obligation on us through Allah's order in the verse,\n\"Allah and His angels are praying on (and praising) the Prophet; O believers! pray on (and praise) him and send him utmost greetings\" (al-Ahzab 56). Coming together and remembering the Prophet causes us to pray on him and to praise him. Who has the right to deny the obligation which Allah has ordered us to fulfill through the Holy Qur'an? The benefit brought by obeying an order of Allah, and the light that it brings to our heart, cannot be measured. That obligation, furthermore, is mentioned in the plural: Allah and His angels are praying on and praising the Prophet -- in a gathering. It is entirely incorrect, therefore, to say that praying on and praising the Prophet must be done alone.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is very meritorious to send salawaat and praise our beloved Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. Sayyiduna Haasaan ibn Thaabit [radhiallaahu anhu] used to sing the praises of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] in Rasulullah’s very presence.\n\nIt should be borne in mind that every good action that is permissible (Jaaiz) or preferable (Mustahabb) must remain as it is. It should not be given the status of Waajib (necessary) or Fardh (compulsory). Once a Mustahabb action is deemed necessary, it will be Makrooh-e-Tahrimi to carry out that action. (Shaami vol.2 pg.120; Halabi).\n\nIn present times, people specify dates and times for celebrating Meeladun-Nabi. Attending such gathering is deemed necessary. Those that do not attend these gatherings are disdained. Therefore, the research Ulama have ruled its impermissibility.\n\nWe could not locate the Hadith of ibn Abbaas [radhiallaahu anhu] in question. Kindly forward us your reference\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
