  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni want to ask abt the \"Haq mehr \".\n\nMy Haq Mehr is Rs-25000/-\nI want to split this amount in following way\nin immediate basis means on wedding night Rs-10000/-\nthen the remaining amount of Rs-15000/- after a longer duration.\n\nplease give me the details & also send me some marriage guide materials ...\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are two types of Mehr\n\n• Mua’jjal (Cash)\n\n• Muajjal (Credit)\n\nAccording to Shariah the Mehr may be agreed on cash or credit. If the wife agrees to defer the payment of the Mehr she may do so. However, if the wife wants the Mehr cash, the husband will have to pay the entire amount.\n\nWe observe the amount of Mehr is exorbitant. Rasulullah () has advised not to be extravagant in the amount of Mehr. It is unfortunate that due to rituals and customs of high amounts of Mehr marriages are being delayed. You should seize the opportunity and explain to your family that the wedding should be simple and free of customs and extravagance. If we follow the blessed Sunnah, Allah will bless the marriage with eternal bliss and happiness.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai\n\nChecked and Approved\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
