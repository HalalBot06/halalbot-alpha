  "answer": "QUESTION\nrelated to fatwa 13964, I wanted to ask, if a girl who is already married(still hindu but will revert to islam) and ask for getting married to me and her husband knows about this and even if he says that i should accept her, then in that case can i say anything to girl? Right now i have said no to girl as i feel girl should try to forget about me after marriage. is it right decision from my side? And when can i accept her or when can i say yes? And what can i do when my parents are not in favour of my marriage with this girl? What is the reward for getting married to a girl after reverting her, being aware that girl reverted to marry me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf the girl accepts Islam and her husband refuses to accept Islam, then her marriage will terminate. You may marry her after 3 menstrual cycles.\n\nIn principle, whosoever becomes a means of guidance for another person and to accept Islam will be immensely rewarded. Such a person have saved another from the eternal fire and displeasure of Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
