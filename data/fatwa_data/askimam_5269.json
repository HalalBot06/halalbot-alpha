  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease quote the Ahadith along with proper references?.JazakAllahu Khairan.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTHE MONTH OF MUHARRAM%0D%0AMuharram is the month with which the Muslims begin their lunar Hijrah%0D%0ACalendar. It is one of the four sanctified months about which the Holy Quran%0D%0Asays,%0D%0A\"The number of the months according to Allah is twelve months (mentioned) in%0D%0Athe Book of Allah on the day in which He created heavens and the earth.%0D%0AAmong these (twelve months) there are four sanctified\".%0D%0A%0D%0AThese four months, according to the authentic traditions are the months of%0D%0ADhul-Qa'dah, Dhul-Hijjah, Muharram and Rajab. All the commentators of the%0D%0AHoly Quran are unanimous on this point, because the Holy Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) in his sermon on the occasion of his last%0D%0AHajj, has declared:%0D%0AOne year consists of twelve months, of which four are sanctified months,%0D%0Athree of them are in sequence; Dhul-Qa'dah, Dhul-Hijjah, Muharram, and the%0D%0Afourth is Rajab.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe specific mention of these four months does not mean that any other month%0D%0Ahas no sanctity, because the month of Ramadhan is admittedly the most%0D%0Asanctified month in the year. But these four months were specifically termed%0D%0Aas sanctified months for the simple reason that their sanctity was accepted%0D%0Aeven by the pagans of Makkah.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn fact, every month, out of the twelve, is originally equal to the other,%0D%0Aand there is no inherent sanctity which may be able which may be attributed%0D%0Ato one of them in comparison to the other months. When Allah Almighty%0D%0Achooses a particular time for His special blessings, the same acquires%0D%0Asanctity out of His grace.%0D%0A%0D%0AThus, the sanctity of these four months was recognized right from the days%0D%0Aof Sayyidina Ibrahim (Alayhis salaam). Since the Pagans of Makkah attributed%0D%0Athemselves to Sayyidina Ibrahim (Alayhis salaam) they observed the sanctity%0D%0Aof these four months and despite their frequent tribal battles, they held it%0D%0Aunlawful to fight in these months.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the Shariah of our Noble Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) the%0D%0Asanctity of these months was upheld and the Holy Quran referred to them as%0D%0Athe \"sanctified months\".%0D%0A%0D%0AThe month of Muharram has certain other characteristics peculiar to it which%0D%0Aare specified below.%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Fasting during the month%0D%0AThe Noble Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has said: 'The best fasts%0D%0Aafter the fasts of Ramadhan are those of the month of Muharram.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AAlthough the fasts of the month of Muharram are not obligatory, yet, the one%0D%0Awho fasts in these days out of his own will and choice is entitled to a%0D%0Agreat reward by Allah Almighty. The Hadith cited above signifies that the%0D%0Afasts of the month of Muharram are most rewardable ones among the Nafl fasts%0D%0Ai.e. the fasts one observes out of his own choice without being obligatory%0D%0Aon him.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Hadith does not mean that the award promised for fasts of Muharram can%0D%0Abe achieved only by fasting for the whole month. On the contrary, each fast%0D%0Aduring this month has merit. Therefore, one should avail of this opportunity%0D%0Aas much as he can.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The day of 'Ashurah'%0D%0AAlthough the month of Muharram is a sanctified month as a whole, yet, the%0D%0A10th day of Muharram is the most sacred among all its days. The day is named%0D%0A'Ashurah'.%0D%0A%0D%0AAccording to the Holy Companion Ibn 'Abbas (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu). The Holy%0D%0AProphet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), when migrated to Madinah, found that%0D%0Athe Jews of Madinah used to fast on the 10th day of Muharram. They said that%0D%0Ait was the day on which the Holy Prophet Musa (Moses) (Alayhis salaam) and%0D%0Ahis followers crossed the Red Sea miraculously and the Pharaoh was drowned%0D%0Ain its waters. On hearing this from the Jews, the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) said, \"We are more closely rotated to Musa (Alayhis salaam)%0D%0Athan you\" and directed the Muslims to fast on the day of 'Ashura'. (Abu%0D%0ADawood)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is also reported in a number of authentic traditions that in the%0D%0Abeginning, fasting on the day of 'Ashura' was obligatory for the Muslims. It%0D%0Awas later that the fasts of Ramadhan were made obligatory and the fast on%0D%0Athe day of 'Ashura' was made optional. Sayyidina 'Aisha (Radhiallaahu %C1nha)%0D%0Ahas said:%0D%0A\"When the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) came to Madinah, he%0D%0Afasted on the day of 'Ashura' and directed the people to fast it. But when%0D%0Athe fasts of Ramadhan were made obligatory, the obligation of fasting was%0D%0Aconfined to Ramadhan and the obligatory nature of the fast of 'Ashura' was%0D%0Aabandoned. Whoever so desires should fast on it and any other who so likes%0D%0Acan avoid fasting on it.\" (Sunan Abu Dawud)%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to fast on the%0D%0Aday of 'Ashura' even after the fasting in Ramadhan was made obligatory.%0D%0AAbdullah ibn Musa (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) reports that the Holy Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) preferred the fast of 'Ashura' on the fasts of%0D%0Aother days and preferred the fasts of Ramadhaan on the fast of 'Ashura'.%0D%0A(Bukhari and Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn short, it is established through a number of authentic Hadiths that%0D%0Afasting on the day of 'Ashura' is Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) and makes one entitled to a great reward.%0D%0A%0D%0AAccording to another Hadith, it is more advisable that the fast of 'Ashura'%0D%0Ashould either be prefixed or suffixed by another fast. It means that one%0D%0Ashould fast two days: the 9th and 10th of Muharram or the 10th and 11th of%0D%0Ait. The reason of this additional fast as mentioned by the Holy Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is that the Jews used to fast on the day of%0D%0A'Ashura alone, and the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) wanted to%0D%0Adistinguish the Muslim way of fasting from that of Jews. Therefore, he%0D%0Aadvised the Muslims to add another fast to that of 'Ashura'.%0D%0A%0D%0ASome traditions signify another feature of the day of 'Ashura. According to%0D%0Athese traditions one should be more generous to his family by providing more%0D%0Afood to them on this day as compared to other days. These traditions are not%0D%0Avery authentic according to the science of Hadith. Yet, some Scholars like%0D%0ABaihaqi and Ibn Hibban have accepted them as reliable.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhat is mentioned above is all that is supported through authentic sources%0D%0Aabout Ashura. However, there are some legends and misconceptions with regard%0D%0Ato 'Ashura' that have managed to find their way into the minds of the%0D%0Aignorant, but have no support of authentic Islamic sources, some very common%0D%0Aof them are these:%0D%0A- This is the day in which Adam (Alayhis salaam) was created.%0D%0A- This is the day in which Ibrahim was born.%0D%0A- This is the day in which Allah accepted the repentance of Sayyidina Adam%0D%0A(Alayhis salaam)%0D%0A- This is the day on which the Qiyaamah (doomsday) will take place.%0D%0A- Whoever takes bath in the day of 'Ashura' will never get ill.%0D%0A%0D%0AAll these and other similar whims and fancies are totally baseless and the%0D%0Atraditions referred to in this respect are not worthy of any credit.%0D%0A%0D%0ASome people take it as Sunnah to prepare a particular type of meal in the%0D%0Aday of 'Ashura'. This practice, too, has no basis in the authentic Islamic%0D%0Asources.%0D%0A%0D%0ASome other people attribute the sanctity of 'Ashura' to the martyrdom of%0D%0ASayyidina Husain (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) during his battle with the Syrian army.%0D%0ANo doubt, the martyrdom of Sayyidina Husain (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) is one of%0D%0Athe most tragic episodes of our history. Yet, the sanctity of 'Ashura'%0D%0Acannot be ascribed to this event for the simple reason that the sanctity of%0D%0A'Ashura' was established during the days of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) much earlier than the birth of Sayyidna Husain%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu %C1nhu).%0D%0A%0D%0AOn the contrary, it is one of the merits of Sayyidna Husain (Radhiallaahu%0D%0A%C1nhu) that his martyrdom took place on the day of 'Ashura'.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnother misconception about the month of Muharram is that it is an evil or%0D%0Aunlucky month, for Sayyidna Husain was killed in it. It is for this%0D%0Amisconception that people avoid holding marriage ceremonies in the month of%0D%0AMuharram.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis is again a baseless concept which is contrary to the express teachings%0D%0Aof the Holy Quran and the Sunnah. Such superstitions have been totally%0D%0Anegated by the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). If the death of%0D%0Aan eminent person in a particular day renders that day unlucky for all times%0D%0Ato come, one can hardly find a day, free from this bad luck, out of 360 days%0D%0Aof the whole year, because each and every day has a history of the demise of%0D%0Asome eminent person. The Holy Quran and the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) have made us free from such superstitious%0D%0Abeliefs, and they should deserve no attention.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnother wrong practice related to this month is to hold the lamentation and%0D%0Amouming ceremonies in the memory of martyrdom of Sayyidna Husain%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu %C1nhu). As mentioned earlier, the event of Karbala is one of%0D%0Athe most tragic events of our history, but the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) has forbidden us from holding the mourning ceremonies on%0D%0Athe death of any person. The people of jahiliyyah (ignorance) used to mourn%0D%0Aover their deceased through loud lamentations, by tearing their clothes and%0D%0Aby beating their cheeks and chests. The Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) stopped the Muslims from doing all this and directed them to%0D%0Aobserve patience by saying \"Innaa lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raaji'oon\". A%0D%0Anumber of authentic Ahaadith are available on the subject. To quote only one%0D%0Aof them:%0D%0A\"He is not from our group who slaps his checks, tears his clothes and cries%0D%0Ain the manner of the people of jahiliyyah\". (Sahih Bukhari)%0D%0A%0D%0AAll the authentic jurists are unanimous on the point that the mourning of%0D%0Athis type is absolutely impermissible. Even Sayyidna Husain (Radhiallaahu%0D%0A%C1nhu) at shortly before his demise, had advised his beloved sister Sayyidah%0D%0AZainab (Radhiallaahu %C1nha) at not to mourn over his death in this manner. He%0D%0Asaid,%0D%0A\"My dear sister, I swear upon you that you, in case I die, shall not tear%0D%0Ayour clothes, nor scratch your face, nor curse anyone for me or pray for%0D%0Ayour death\". (Al-Kamil, ibn Kathir vol. 4 pg. 24)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is evident from this advice of Sayyidna Husain, (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) that%0D%0Athis type of mourning is condemned even by the blessed person for the memory%0D%0Aof whom these mourning ceremonies are held. Every Muslim should avoid this%0D%0Apractice and abide by the teachings of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) and his beloved grand child Sayyidna Husain (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu).%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Taqi Uthmaani"
