  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDoes it comes under sunnah to perform collective prayer (da'wah) for the dead every year?? Also is it right to give treat on that day every year?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nOur Illustrious Fuqahā have regarded it to be Makrūh (undersirable) to call upon gatherings for  the Isāle thawāb (recurring reward) of the Mayyit.\n\n(āp ke masā’il ūr ‘unkā hal, Vol.3, Pg.188)\n\n However, if the purpose of the gathering is to lighten the grief of the relatives of the deceased, then it will be permissible. Gathering of this nature should be held occasionally not annually.\n\n(āp ke masā’il ūr ‘unkā hal, Vol.3, Pg.192)\n\nAs far as feeding is concern, one should remember the deceased will only receive the reward of feeding the poor, as for entertaining the guest or treating relatives,that will be considered as D῾awat.\n\n(āp ke masā’il ūr ‘unkā hal, Vol.3, Pg.188)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl. Abduz Zaman,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
