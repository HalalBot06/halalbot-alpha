  "question": "Shrine of HAzrat Ali ... in afghanistan??",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhere was Hazrat Ali burried. I came across a web site with pictures of Hazrat Ali's shrine in mizar-e-sharif, Afghanistan. I was wondering how he was burried there as I think he died when he was a caliph and was supposed to be in Mecca or madina. Please Clarify. Jazak Allah Kher.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSayyidina Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu) is buried in Najf, Iraq. However this is\nthe popular version and could not be stated with certainty. There are a few\nSahabas (RA) who are not famous buried in Afghanistan. Furthermore to say\nthat Hazrat Ali (Radhiallaahu Anhu) is buried in Mazar Sharif is incorrect\nand propaganda of the Shias.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
