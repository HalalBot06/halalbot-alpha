  "question": "1. in what kind of places do JIN usually stay & how do they possess a person? do they use MAGIC? 2. a Relationship Question with a non mahram girl...gonna Marry her.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAoa, I wanted to ask you about JINS, lately I had an encounter with one of them, someone I know was possessed by the JIN, Alhamdulillah we were able to take care of it, I want to know in what kind of places do JIN usually stay & how do they possess a person? do they use MAGIC? , I have also heard their powers weaken as they move away from the Arab Peninsula i.e The GULF. + 2) I know someone who has a GirlFriend, I told him that it's HARAM to keep a GirlFriend i.e any relationship before marriage. But he says he's gonna Marry her. He says that he only talks with her, he doesn't even touch her, and they don't do any other haram work like kissing or anything else, How can I Help him or stop this??\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Evil Jinns tend to favour places of filth and dens of vice and places of evil. However, Jinns ? pious or impious ? could be found everywhere. Yes, it is possible for them to possess a person. Generally, an evil Jinn who wishes to harass a particular person possesses him by getting into him or by bothering him whenever he wishes. I am unaware of whether their powers get weaker or not the further they are from the Arabic peninsula.\n\n2. Irrespective of what his intention is, it is not permissible for him to converse with her. This is a Shaytaani motivation. Continue advising him that what he is doing is wrong.\n\nAnd Allah Ta?ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
