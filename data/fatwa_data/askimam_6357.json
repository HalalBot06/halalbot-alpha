  "answer": "QUESTION\nFrom my readings it seems that most scholars believe that one should consult the heart or get a sign/vision/dream after the istikhara to determine the choice to be taken. But there are also other scholars who believe if one decides to do a certain thing or is inclined towards a certain course of action, after Istikhara one should go ahead with the intended action, trusting that Allah will choose what is best for him.In other words,the concept of Istikhara does not imply that one should wait for signs from God in taking one?s decisions.It only means that one should take one?s decisions and do whatever one think is right and then ask God that if the decision is the correct one, He should help us in carrying it out and making the plans successful, while if it is not the correct one, He should then alter the circumstances in such a way that one do not implement our decision, and that He should provide satisfaction to our heart in doing so. (But before istikhara one should consult knowledgeable and intelligent people whom he trusts, study the matter in depth and see which is the best course for him to take). Could you inform me the basis for the different views .Also,which one do you think is the closest to the truth & why.(By the way ,what is the stand of the imam mazhabs like Imam Hanafi,Shafie & salaf scholars,for example Ibnu Taimiyah ? )\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSTATUS OF DREAMS IN ISTIKHARAH%0D%0A%0D%0AFirstly, one must understand that none of the narrations in the Ahadith have%0D%0Aany mention regarding a dream, or even about performing the 'Istikharah'%0D%0Abefore sleeping. However, some \"Ulama do prefer that Istikharah be performed%0D%0Abefore sleeping.%0D%0A%0D%0AWith regards to the person who does see a dream after performing%0D%0A'Istikharah', this dream is just like any other dream that a person sees.%0D%0AThis means that just as other dreams fall under one of three categories%0D%0A(which will be explained shortly), likewise will the dreams seen after%0D%0AIstikharah1 be. It is reported in a Hadith narrated in Sahih Bukhari and%0D%0Aother books of Hadith that dreams are of three types:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Hadeeth-un-Nafs (imaginations)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. 'takhweefus shaytaan' a dream instilled in the mind by shaytan. This also%0D%0Aknown as 'wasaaisu-us-shaytaan' or 'tahzeenu-us-shaytaan'.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. 'Bushraa minallaah' True dreams, which are also known as 'mubash-sharaat'%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is mentioned in a Hadith that the dreams of pious muminin (believers) are%0D%0Agenerally true dreams.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnother Hadith states: \"The most true dreams are those seen at the time of%0D%0ASahar (early dawn).%0D%0A%0D%0AIS SALAH NECESSARY?%0D%0A%0D%0AIn some Ahadith that deal with 'Istikharah', mention has been made of two%0D%0Araka'at, while others contain no mention of Salah before 'Istikharah'. Since%0D%0Athe narration of Hadrat Jabir (Radhiallaahu Anhu) mentions the performance%0D%0Aof two raka'at before 'Istikharah', Allamah 'Aini (RA) has stated that it is%0D%0ASunnah to perform two raka'at before 'Istikharah'. In fact, the narration of%0D%0AAbu Ayyub Ansari (Radhiallaahu Anhu) contains the following words: 'Thumma%0D%0Asalli maa kataballaahu laka'%0D%0A%0D%0A\"Then perform how many rakaat Allah has destined for you\" referring to the%0D%0Afact that if more than two raka'at (whether 4, 6, 8 etc.) are performed, it%0D%0Awill be preferable. This narration of Hadrat Abu Ayyub Ansari (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhu) also mentions of the performance of 'wudu' properly before the Salah,%0D%0Aand praising Allah before the du'a.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, since most of the narrations do not have any mention of Salah,%0D%0A'Istikharah' will be correct by reciting the du'a only, especially when%0D%0Acircumstances do not allow one to perform Salah.%0D%0A%0D%0AHOW MANY TIMES?%0D%0A%0D%0AAs far as performance of 'Istikharah' more than once is concerned, the%0D%0A\"Ulama have regarded it as 'mustahabb' i.e. preferable to perform it three%0D%0Atimes. This is on the basis of the narration of Ibn Mas'ud (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhu) wherein he states that when Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Amade du'aa, he would repeat it three times.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever this is not a Sunnah in Istikharah as there has been no mention in%0D%0Athis regard in any of the Ahadith of Istikharah. As regards the narration of%0D%0Aseven times, due to it being an unauthentic narration, it cannot be used as%0D%0Aa basis for the establishment of any matter in Din.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE SHORTEST FORM OF ISTIKHARAH1%0D%0A%0D%0AIn a 'weak' narration, Hadrat Abu Bakr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) is reported to%0D%0Ahave stated that whenever Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) intended%0D%0Ato do anything, he used to say:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"O Allah, destine good for me, and choose for me'%0D%0A%0D%0ACONCLUSION%0D%0A%0D%0ALastly, one of the most important benefits of Istikharah is that it%0D%0Astrengthens a person's connection with Allah. Through excessive Istikharah,%0D%0Aone learns to take directly from the treasures of our Creator, the Being in%0D%0Awhose hands lies all good and bad, benefit and harm. May Allah grant the%0D%0Awriter, the reader and the rest of the ummah the understanding of this great%0D%0Aand noble Sunnah.%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the above, it is apparent how easy Din has been made by Allah, and%0D%0Aactually we are the ones who have made Din difficult. Consequently, the%0D%0Alifestyle that we follow causes us, as well as others, to believe that Islam%0D%0Ais a difficult way of life. However, Allah has kept comfort, contentment,%0D%0Apeace of mind and ease only in following His commands and the Sunnah of His%0D%0ARasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0ANow that we have learnt the importance of this great Sunnah, it remains our%0D%0Aresponsibility to search for every other Sunnah, bring it into our lives and%0D%0Atake it to the rest of mankind. This was indeed the way of the Honourable%0D%0ACompanions of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and our pious%0D%0Apredecessors. May Allah grant us the towfiq to follow their noble footsteps,%0D%0AAameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aby Shaykhul Hadith Moulana Fazlur Rahmaan Saheb"
