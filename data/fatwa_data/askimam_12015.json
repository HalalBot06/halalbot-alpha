  "answer": "QUESTION\nQ1. Does touching one's private part intentionally or unintentionally, directly or through clothes break the wudu? Q2. Is there anything specific to be done with aqeeqah hair? i.e. should be buried or burned? Q3. Where exactly should we hanafi mazhab followers should put our hands in prayers i.e. on the belly button or under it or above it, or should we put them on the chest?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. According to the Hanafi Madhab, if one touches his/her private parts, the Wudhu is not invalidated. However, according to Imaam Shaafi?ee [ra], if the private parts are touched directly, Wudhu will break.\n\n2. The hair shaved after 7 days should be buried.\n\n3. A Hanafi will place his hand beneath his navel when standing in Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
