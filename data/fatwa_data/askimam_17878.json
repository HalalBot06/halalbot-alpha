Jazakallah kairan.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\n \n\n1.       A person should partake of sehri till before subhu saadiq(break of dawn) and should terminate his fast upon the setting of the sun. Once The calling of azaan is merely an indication informing people to end their fast. The Fuqahaa have stated that it is Waajib to exercise precaution in breaking fast.        (Tahtaawi Karachi /pg 370)\n\n \n\n2.       Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi wasallam) mentioned in a Hadeeth : \n\nقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ( إن للصائم عند فطره لدعوة ما ترد )\n\nVerily the duaa of a fasting person at the time of iftaar is never rejected.\n\n \n\nHowever there are few duaas mentioned in the ahaadeeth.  Abdullah bin ‘Amr Bin Al Aas (Radhiyallahu ‘anhu) used to read the following duaa:-\n\nاللهم اني اسالك برحمتك التي وسعت كل شيئ ان تغفرلي\n\n \n\n] قال ابن مليكة سمعت عبد الله بن عمرو يقول إذا أفطر اللهم إني أسألك برحمتك التي وسعت كل شيء أن تغفر لي [\n\n \n\nThe famous duaa at the time of Iftaar is:-\n\nاللهم لك صمت وبك امنت وعليك توكلت وعلي رزقك افطرت\n\n[Reported by Ibn Majah 1/557 and Kitaabul Azkaar of Imaam An-nawawi (Rahnmatullahi ‘alayhi) & Targeeb Wa Tarheeb Pg 90 /V2 -Darul Qahirah ].\n\n3.         One should fast with the intention of following the Sunnat of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) and upon breaking his fast make duaa, especially for himself, his family and the entire ummat regarding the matters of this world and hereafter [e.g. pious wife, leading a life of piety, good and halaal job etc…].\n\n4.         A person should intend that he is keeping roza for the pleasure of Allah Ta’ala with the hope that his deeds will be presented in the best of conditions. There follow a number of ahaadeeth which encourage fasting on Mondays and Thursdays: \n\n It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was keen to fast on Mondays and Thursdays. [Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasaa’i, Ibn Maajah and Al-Targheeb pg 126/V2]. \n\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Deeds are shown (to Allaah) on Mondays and Thursdays, and I like my deeds to be shown when I am fasting.”(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, At Targheeb pg 124/V2)\n\n5.         Allah Ta’ala states:-\n\nآَمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَأَنْفِقُوا مِمَّا جَعَلَكُمْ مُسْتَخْلَفِينَ فِيهِ فَالَّذِينَ آَمَنُوا مِنْكُمْ وَأَنْفَقُوا لَهُمْ أَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ\n\nBelieve in Allah and His Messenger, and spend (in charity) out of the (substance) whereof He has made you heirs. For, those of you who believe and spend (in charity) for them is a great Reward. [Al-Hadeed  57 : 7].\n\nSOME GUIDELINES IN GIVING SADAQAH\n\nThe goal of giving charity is to help those in need without offending their feelings or to show off. Therefore, Sadaqah should be given:\n\na)      In secret whenever possible\n\nb)      In a way that does not show that the person giving Sadaqa is better or out of his generosity and good heart is helping the poor who cannot survive without him and who depends on him\n\nc)       The goal is to enrich rather than just give a meagre amount\n\nd)      To give the best that we have.\n\n \n\n6.       Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) used to read the sunnats that follow and precede the fardh salaat at home. This was done to encourage the womenfolk to perform their salaat. However, if a person knows he will neglect this Sunnah salaah due to being engrossed in worldly affairs and domestic chores, it will be advisable for him to perform them in the Masjid.\n\n \n\n7.       Islam is not opposed to secular education as it will enhance your skills for advancing the cause of Islam. The Muslim student when seeking knowledge and education must consolidate his/her faith by purifying his/her intention, since sincerity is the foundation upon which every work is established. The Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) said: \"Actions are judged by intention and every man shall have but that which he intended\" [al-Bukhari and Muslim]. Hence, the Muslim should pursue education for the pleasure of Allah Ta’ala and not for material or social gain. Allah Ta’ala declares :\n\n \n\nمَنْ كَانَ يُرِيدُ الْعَاجِلَةَ عَجَّلْنَا لَهُ فِيهَا مَا نَشَاءُ لِمَنْ نُرِيدُ ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَا لَهُ جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَاهَا مَذْمُومًا مَدْحُورًا\n\n \n\n\"Whoever wishes for the quick-passing (transitory enjoyment of this world), We readily grant him what We will for whom We like. Then, afterwards, We have appointed for him Hell, he will burn therein disgraced and rejected\" [Surah Israah  V18].\n\nHowever, it is crucial that students do not compromise their Islamic education with the excuse of their studies. They should also be cautious of teachings that challenge the code of belief and law (Shari'ah) of Islam and adopt the criteria that would enable them to distinguish these secular thoughts and ideas from their field of interest. Seeking a profession that provides halal income sources is also the priority of the Muslim.\n\nThe Muslim student should develop a professional attitude towards his/her education and cherish their work and career prospects. The Prophet (saws) said: \"Allah likes it when the one amongst you perfects his works\" [sound hadeeth, reported by Bayhaqi in Shoua'bul Iman]. This prophetic guidance clearly directs the believer to perform tasks to the best of his/her capabilities. Hence, excelling in the field of study should be the aim of every Muslim student. However, the Muslim student should not have ambitions that selfishly neglect his/her obligations towards his/her Muslim society and Ummah. In fact, his/her prime ambition should be gaining the necessary expertise and experience to participate in the reconstruction of the Islamic State. It is essential that Muslim students evolve this Islamic state of mind; otherwise the Islamic hope will remain a dream.\n\nIt will be permissible for the women folk to study secular education but it should be done within the framework and tenets of the Shari’ah (pardah, no intermingling, no immoralities and so forth..) \n\n8.         Imaan and life for pious actions which are desirable in Islam, have its roots and foundations in the initial stages of a child’s life. If this is good and correct then the rest of the child’s life will follow suit. If a child’s initial life is spoilt then there is less hope for the balance of his life.\n\nFor the correct rearing of a child, it is imperative that the entire environment is corrected. Just as the environment is improved; so too will be the child’s upbringing. If all the occupants in a house are punctual with salaah, have good character and are pious, then it will follow that the child will also be pious and have good character.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
