  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThis question is regarding Fatwa #  14727 . I am living in the edmonton region. I would like to know where the best place to study quran is in canada or somewhere close by to edmonton? I was thinking about the darul uloom in toronto but my mom said its too far. Do you know any schools close by the province of alberta?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n   You are living in Edmonton and wish to study Quran. There is no need for you to go out of Edmonton. Alhamdu Lillah, the people of Edmonton are fortunate to have Shaikh Moulana Qari Iqbal Subratie, a great Aalim of Deen, among them. He is based in Markazul Ilm Masjid.\n   The people of his area are deriving great benefits through him. I have full confidence in his knowledge. He is a very honest, sincere and dedicated Aalim of Deen. You may contact him through ayub@shaw.ca and request to study under him.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
