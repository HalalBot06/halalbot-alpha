  "question": "The first Adhan for Jumuah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\n \n\nThe first Azan for Jumu'ah prayer, which is called ahead of the Azan called before the Khutba in front of the Khateeb was introduced by Uthman (3rd khalifa rashid), Radi-Allahu Anhu. It was introduced to make the people aware of the time of Jumu'ah prayer so they could make the necessary preparation and could reach the masjid in time. The first Azan was not called from the masjid at that time rather it was called at a busy place like a market so more people could hear it.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn muslim countries, the first Azan for Jumu'ah prayer is called from the masjid on speakers these days instead of a market or any other busy place. As a lot of people can hear the Azan from the speaker, the objective for which it was started is achieved. But in our masjid in Winnipeg, , the sound of Azan does not leave the masjid even when the Azan is called by using speakers. By law in , the sound of the azan must not leave the masjid as it is considered a botheration for the general public in the neighborhood. So on Jumu'ah, first Azan is only heard by a few people who have already come into the masjid for Jumu'ah salat. So the first Azan does not even serve the objective for which it was introduced. My question is, in this situation only, will it be right to go back to the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (Sall-Allahu Alaihi Wasallam) and the Sunnah of Abu Baker (1st khalifa rashid) and Umar (2nd khalifa rashid) Radi-Allahu Anhum of calling only one Azan (second Azan) for Jumu'ah prayer?\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOur imam has now started the practice of calling only one Azan (2nd azan) before Jumu'ah prayer but a few people are opposing it. They insist; the Sahabah at the time of Uthman (3rd khalifa rashid), had a consensus (Ijmaah) on two Azans and therefore, it must continue. While our imam says; there was never a consensus (Ijmaah) among Sahabah on calling two azans from the masjid and the first azan does not serve its purpose when called from our masjid so we should go back to the sunnah of the prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam).\n\n \n\nI would really appreciate if you could provide me guidance/fatwa in this regard to clarify the situation. May Allah Subhana Wata'alah reward you with His blessings.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWassalam,\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nShahbaz Shaukat\n\nWinnipeg, Canada\n\n\n\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n\nYour question has already being answered by our competent Ulama, resubmitted queries are automatically deleted."
