  "answer": "QUESTION\nAre sunnat and nawafil included in Kasr Prayer or only Farz ( two Rakaats) will be prayed? Also what tell me abut Vitar in Esha Kasr prayer. During travel I perform Kasr Prayer such that pray complete Salat with all sunnat and nawafil and shorten only Farz from four rakaats to two rakaats. Is this correct or not ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQasr (concession from four Rakaats to two Rakaats) during Safar (travel) is\nonly in the Fardh Salaat of Dhuhr, Asr and Esha Salaats. In principle, it is\nnot necessary for a Musaafir (traveller) to perform the Sunnat-e-Muakkadah\n(emphasised Sunnats) before and after the Fardh Salaats.\n\nIt is advisable that if he has time, he should perform them. There is no\nQasr in Sunnat and Nafl Salaats. According to the Hanafi Madhab, Witr is\nWaajib and is three Rakaats with one Salaam. Witr Salaat has to be performed\nduring Safar (travel).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
