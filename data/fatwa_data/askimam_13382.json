  "question": "to make dua COLLECTIVELY and too after ALL SALAHS?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCould you please just inform me what was our beloved Rasul`s(peace be on him!)practice? to make dua COLLECTIVELY and too after ALL SALAHS? Please do not tell me if it is permissbilbe or an innovation.Just tell me what was Rasulullah`s MUBARAK AMAL (Practice)in this respect.\n\nGoing by your point,I am afraid that all post funeral rites (commen in Indian sub-continet)will be considered at least \"permissible\"For, if we stop such Muslims from these practices i.e.,Ziyarat,Cahlum,Barsi etc.)they can easily defend their innovated practices claming that they do not consider them to be compulsory. Eagerly waiting for your references about Rasulullah `s PRACTICE,concerning this post-prayer collective and daily dua,I conclude.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBoth practices are proven in the Hadith, a) Collective Du'aa, b) Du'aa after Salaat\n\nAny act that is Mubaah cannot be prohibited without any justifiable Shar'ee reason. We have made ourselves clear. If the Imaam regards making collective Du'aa compulsory then only it will be Bid'at. The same applies with all Mubaah acts in Shari'ah. If someone is steadfast on a Mubaah act, we cannot\ndeclare that as Bid'at. In that way, many Mubaah acts will be regarded as Bid'at. The analogy of post funeral rites is incorrect.\n\nPost funeral customs as the word suggests is certainly regarded as compulsory. That can be put to a simple test. Participants reproach non-participants and condemn them. That is not so in Du'aa. If the Imaam does that, then that too will be Bid'at.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
