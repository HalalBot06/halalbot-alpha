  "question": "I have been in love with a girl for the last 5 years. We wanted to get married, but her family did not agree.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThey forced her to get married to someone else. Her husband started to beat her from the first day they got married. She does not love him nor feels comfortable with him at all. After 2 years she got in touch with me and requested for help. I still love her and she also feels the same way about me. I want to know what we should do now? Kindly advise.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, remember the woman in question is somebody else?s wife. Communicating with her, and moreso expressing love to her is totally Haraam. Your expression of love to her will only complicate matters. Your personal interests will govern your approach, and you will not deal with the issue in a rational manner. We advise you to remove hopes from your heart of having a relationship with her.%0D%0A%0D%0AThereafter, if she does not approach you, simply move on with your life and forget about her. If she approaches you for help, then offer her good advice as you would offer any Muslim sister in distress. Encourage her to make the marriage work and get the local Ulama to speak to her husband. %0D%0A%0D%0AHer husband should be given a chance to mend his ways. Allah Ta?ala knows exactly what your intention is. The test of sincerity is that you make Du?aa from the bottom of your heart that her husband changes his ways and lives happily with her.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
