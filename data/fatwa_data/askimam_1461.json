  "question": "Is it permissable for a married muslim woman to visit a relative's grave?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Sahib, 1)I am a married muslim lady who will be visiting India in a couple of months. Last year, my grandfather, with whom I was very close to, passed away. Now, that I will be visiting India, I would like to know if it is permissable for me to pay a visit to my grandfather's grave. Ofcourse, I am very particular about my hijaab even if I were to go to a graveyard. 2)If it is NOT permissable for me, what steps should I take to comfort myself and what duas should I perform for my beloved grandfather? Your kind assistance will be very much appreciated. Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nVISITING THE GRAVEYARD%0D%0AHadhrat ibn Mas'ood (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) narrates that Rasulullah ? said, 'I used to stop you from visiting graves, (now) visit the graves for it creates abstention (in love) for the world and reminds of the hereafter. (Mishkaat p. 154 - Qadeemi)%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the above Ahaadith, it is clear that visiting graves was prohibited for all (men and women), and thereafter the prohibition was abrogated. Therefore, it is Mustahabb for males to visit graves. With regard to females, see the following Ahaadith:%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Huryara (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) narrates that Rasulullah (?) cursed women who visit the graveyards. (Mishkaat p. 154 - Qadeemi)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Aaisha (Radhiallaahu %C1nha) said to Rasulullah ? 'Oh Prophet of Allah what should I say when visiting the graves', Rasulullah ? said, 'Assalaamu Alaa ahlud diyaar minal mu'mineena wal muslimeena wayarhamu Allaahu al-mustaqdimeena minnaa wal must'akhireena, wa innaa inshaa'a Allaahu bikum lalaahiqoona%0D%0A%0D%0AWhile Rasulullah ? taught Hadhrat Aaisha (Radhiallaahu %C1nha) the Du'a when visiting the graves, he also cursed females from doing so.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe reason for prohibiting females from visiting graves is due to our corrupted environment wherein women (ly) who do not adhere to the laws of Hijaab and hence strange men are attracted towards them. Therefore, it is not permissible for young females to visit the graveyard.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, if the laws of the Shariah (Hijaab, intermingling, crying, etc.) are not violated then the prohibition may be set aside. Since generally the women visiting the graves are not free from the above aspects, they should refrain from doing so.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf a female visits the grave to remember death and soften without crying ... there is nothing wrong if they are old. It is Makrooh (not permissible) if they are young (Shaami vol. 1 p. 665 - Maajidiyya)%0D%0A%0D%0AISAAL-E-SAWAAB%0D%0AAlmighty Allah Ta%E3la states in the Noble Qur%E3n, 'O` you who believe!! Obey Allah and His Rasul'.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe life of the Prophet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) is indeed the best example for us to follow. During the time of the Prophet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) many of his family members, his wives, daughters, uncles and his illustrious companions left the world whilst engaged in the most noble work and effort of uplifting the religion of Islam. Despite the Prophet's deep love for them, he did not (on any single occasion) commemorate the innovative custom of inviting people on different intervals to recite the Qur?aan for Isaal-e-Sawaab.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhile we do believe in Isaal-e-Sawaab, however, the act of inviting people for Qur?aan Khatam and Dhikr, etc. has taken much prominence and people regard it as compulsory. In principle, any act permissible regarded as compulsory in Shari?ah is Bid?at as that is distortion of Deen. %0D%0A%0D%0AConcerned and beloved ones should recite Qur?aan or any act of virtue, i.e. give charity, etc. with sincerity and gift it to the deceased. That is closer to the Sunnah and more beneficial to the deceased than performing an act of Bid?at which is of no benefit to the deceased, thus, defeating the actual purpose.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
