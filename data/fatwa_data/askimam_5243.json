  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe greatest factor which will increase or rather incur barakat and\nblessings in ones sustenance is total obedience to Allah Ta'ala and His\nRasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nAs mentioned in a Hadith, disobedience and sin deprives and diminishes the\nsustenance of a person. (Nasai, ibn Majah, Ahmed in his Musnad and Haakim in\nhis Mustadrak). Five times daily salaat is also a means through which Allah\nTa'ala causes blessings and increase in ones earnings. In the Ahaadith,\nthere are numerous deeds of piety mentioned which increase the sustenance of\na person e.g. upholding family ties and spending in the path of Allah. Nabi\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to make the following Du'aa: Allahummak\nfina bi halaalika an haraamika wa agnina bifadlika amman siwaak.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
