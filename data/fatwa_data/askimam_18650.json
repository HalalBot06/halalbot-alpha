  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\n \n\nIt is believed that one should not keep or plant CACTUS Plants at home. This may bring illness or bad fortune. Please kindly advise me how far is it correct if we see in the light of Islam.\n\n \n\n \n\nMy father is continuously sick and we have cactus plants in our house. Please kindly help me in replying me through email.I would be really greatfull to the Fatwa Team.\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nThe belief that cactus plant brings evil and misfortune to one’s home is incorrect. This has no basis in the Qurān and Hadīth. Therefore, you make keep the cactus plant and not remove it.\n\n \n\nAs far as your father’s sickness concern, you may read YA SALAAMU [1] 131 times and other masnūn athkār for him. Inshā Allāh, Allāh jalla jalāluhu will grant him Shifā’.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\nMl. Abdur Rahman Shareef,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā\n\n\n\n\n[1] يا سلام"
