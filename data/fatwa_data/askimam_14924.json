  "question": "Do women attend Eid Salaah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nUmm Atiyah (ra) reported: \"The Messenger of Allah (saw) commanded us to bring out on Eid-al-Fitr and Eid-al-Adha, young women, hijab-observing adult women and the menstruating women. The menstruating women stayed out of actual Salaat but participated in good deeds and Duaa (supplication). I (Umm Atiyah) said to the Holy Prophet (saw): Oh! Messenger of Allah, one does not have an outer garment. He replied: Let her sister cover her with her garment.\" (muslim)\n\n Ash-Shawkaanee (radiyallaahu `anhu) said:\n\"Note that the Prophet consistently performed this prayer on every Eid, never neglecting it. He commanded the people to go out for it; he even commanded the free women, the virgins, and the menstruating women to go out, instructing the latter to refrain from praying, in order for all of them to witness this good and the Muslims' supplications. He further commanded the woman who did not own a jilbaab (outer overall garment for women) to borrow her friend's (al-Bukhari)\n\n Can you please verify the above as some people say these hadiths are not true ? do women have to attend the eid prayers? is it wajib or depends on one's choice? in the arab world we see separate areas being assigned for women during eid prayers which we dont find in our countries, if such facility is available can a women go for eid prayers?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nWe confirm that these ahadeeth are recorded in Sahih Al Bukhari and Sahih Muslim and thus authentic.\n\nFurthermore, this is not an isolated practice of the Sahaba (R.A). In fact during the era of Rasul Allah ( sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam ) women (excluding those who were menstruating) would attend the Salaats in the Masajid five times a day.\n\nThis was the general practice and was in fact needed, since Islam was in its initial stages and the women were needed to become accustomed to performing Salaats.\n\n\nMoreover, the aspect of fitnah was far less than in our era.\n\nTherefore, although the need for the women to be accustomed to these Salaats still exists today and will remain till the day of Qiyaama; the element of fitna (evil and mischief) is more threatening today than ever before.\n\nPonder over the fact that Ummul-Mo’mineen Sayyidatuna Ayesha (R.A) had began to discourage this practice not very long after the demise of Rasul Allah ( sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam ) based on the same element of fitna. Can we imagine what she would have said had she witnessed our era?\n\n\nThe scholars of Islam always considered this aspect of the fitna and therefore many of them ruled that women should not attend the Salaat, neither in masjid nor at the Eid Gaah (Musallah).\n\nAfter quoting the hadeeth in question, Imam Tirmidhi (R.A) has reported from Imaams (Abdullah ibn Mubarak (R.A) and Sufiyaan As Thawri (R.A)) that they considered it makrooh for the women to attend the Eid Salâah. Imam Tirmidhi (R.A) also made reference to the statement of Sayyidatuna Ayesha (R.A) that was quoted above. (Sunan Tirmidhi Vol.2 Pg.430 #539-40).\n\n\nThis is also the view of the Hânafi Scholars. (A’ini in Umdatur Qari Vol.3 Pg. 305; I’laau Sunan Vol. 8 Pg 107)\n\n\nEven those scholars who allow the women to attend attach strict conditions, like:\nThe women should not be scantly adorned.\nThey should not have applied perfume etc.\n\nOne cannot say for fact that on the day of Eid, no person would prefer to be shabbily dressed. On the contrary, people generally adorn their best attire on this day. So how can it be justified that the women be permitted to attend when the conditions of permission will certainly be flouted?\n\n\n\nAnother reason for which all the women were ordered to attend was so that the large numbers of the Muslims may become apparent, thereby attracting others towards Islam.\n\nMore than being affected by ones inner spirits and enthusiasms, one needs to bear in mind the commands ofAllah and be conscious of not displeasing Him. There is no rational in trying to fulfill a Mustahab (liked) act by perpetuating several haraams and prohibitions.\n\n\nLastly, some people think that it is only the Asians who prohibit the above.\n\nHereunder is a short list of the scholars of the past who also prevented the women from attending either the five Salaats in masajid or the Eid Salâah:\nSayyidatuna Ayesha (R.A) (Sahih Al Bukhari  )\nSayyiduna Abdullah b. Mas’ood (R.A) (Majma’uz Zawaahid)\nSayyiduna Abdullah b. Umar (R.A) (Musannad ibn Abi Sheyba #5845)\nSayyiduna Urwa b. Zubayr (R.A) (Musannad ibn Abi Sheyba #5846)\nSayyiduna Qasim b. Mohammed b. Abi Bakr Faqih Al Madinah (R.A) (Musannad ibn Abi Sheyba #5847)\nSayyiduna Ibraheem Nakh’ee (R.A) (Musannad ibn Abi Sheyba #5844, #5848)\nImaam Abdullah b. Al-Mubarak (R.A) (Sunan Tirmidhi #539-40 Vol.2 Pg.420)\nImaam Malik (R.A) (Umdatur Qari Vol.3 Pg. 305)\nImaam Sufiyaan As Thawri (R.A) (Sunan Tirmidhi)\nImam Abu Yusuf (R.A) student of Imaam Abu Hanifa (R.A) (Umdatur Qari Vol.3 Pg. 305)\n\n \n\nNow, ask yourself and question: How many of the above are Asians?\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMaulana Mohammed ibn Maulana Harooon Abasoomer\nDarul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai."
