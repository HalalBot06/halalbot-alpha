Thanks\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nThe Quran is the speech of Allah Ta’ala revealed to Rasulullah ( (صلى الله عليه وسلم through Jibreel (عليه السلام). The Quran was memorised and preserved in every generation and has reached us today in its most pristine form. This will continue till the day of Qiyamah. Allah Ta’ala has taken it upon Himself to safeguard and protect the Quran.\n\n“Indeed we have revealed the Quran and we will indeed protect it”.\n\n(Quran 15:8)\n\nIn many Ahadith, Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) has highlighted the great rewards for reciting Quran and has encouraged the Ummah to make an effort to recite the Quran correctly even though it may be difficult on an individual. Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) has mentioned:\n\n“Whosoever recites one letter of the Quran, he will get one reward and every reward is multiplied tenfold. I do not say الم is one letter, but “Alif” is one letter, “laam” is one letter and “meem” is another letter.\n\n(Sunan Tirmizi, Vol. 2, Pg. 119, HM Saeed)[1]\n\n“An expert in the Quran will be in the company of the noble and pious angels, and the one who stutters and recites and it is difficult upon him (to recite correctly in spite of excessive attempts to recite correctly) will receive double reward”.\n\n(Sahih Muslim, Vol. 1, Pg.  269, Qadeemi)[2]\n\nIn order to receive the rewards promised in the Ahadith for that person who recites the Quran, it will be necessary to recite the Quran in the Arabic language as it has been revealed to Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم). However, if a person does not understand the Arabic language and wishes to explore the beautiful meaning and message of the Quran, he may do so by obtaining a reliable translation of the Holy Quran. It should be borne in mind that this is merely a translation of the Quran which has been compiled to benefit those who do not understand Arabic language. The true beauty of the Quran can only be explored and appreciated in the Arabic language. You may benefit from the English version of the Quran whilst making an effort to read the Quran in Arabic. (May Allah Ta’ala grant us all the correct understanding of the Quran, Aameen).\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftāa\n\n\n\n\n[1] عن أيوب بن موسى قال سمعت محمد بن كعب القرظي قال سمعت عبد الله بن مسعود يقول قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم من قرأ حرفا من كتاب الله فله به حسنة والحسنة بعشر أمثالها لا أقول الم حرف ولكن ألف حرف ولام حرف وميم حرف (باب ما جاء في من قرأ حرفا من القران ما له من الأجر)\n\n[2] عن عائشة قالت قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم الماهر بالقرآن مع السفرة الكرام البررة والذي يقرأ القرآن ويتتعتع فيه وهو عليه شاق له أجران (باب فضيلة حافظ القران)"
