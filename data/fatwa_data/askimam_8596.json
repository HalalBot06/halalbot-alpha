  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs it ok to attend or host mixed gatherings? Here in US in Indo-Pak community one is social outcast if one does not attend or host dinner parties. Usually in restuarant, hotel or person's home. Most times mans is on one side of room, ladys on other, but can see each other.If lady wears hijaab? Is it true that if a Muslim invites you, you cannot refuse? How can we be sure food is halaal? Can we ask? PLEASE HELP!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible to accept any invitation in which the laws of Shari?ah are violated. Mixed gathering is strictly prohibited.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is rather unfortunate that sin and evil has become so rife nowadays that people don't even regard sin as sin anymore and how true are the words of our beloved Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), 'A time will dawn upon man that Zina (adultery) will become so widespread that the most pious man in this world will be that person who witnesses two people doing evil on the street pavement. This person would go up to them and say to them that go and do your action behind a tree, he will not stop them from the evil rather he would tell them that instead of doing it in front of everybody, go and do your actions behind a tree. The person who tells them this will be the most pious person. Today, we are presently experiencing the above adultery is being done openly, everywhere without any prohibition or obstruction.' (Islahi Khutubaat, Mufti Taqi Usmani vol.7 pg.32)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn an Aayat of the noble Qur'aan, Allah Ta'ala commands the believers, 'Say (O' Muhammad) unto the believers lower your gazes and protect your private parts. That is more pure for you. Verily, Allah is all informed of what you are doing.' (Surah Nur). Evil glances is to look at any Ghayr Mahram especially with desire or to attain pleasure whether the person is alive or it is a picture. Both situations are totally Haraam. The greatest hindrance for the reformation and purification of the innerself is the sin of evil glances. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) explained in a Hadith, 'Evil glances is a poisonous arrow from the arrows of Iblees.' (Majmauz Zawaaid vol.8 pg.63)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another Hadith, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) mentioned, 'The Zina of the eyes is in evil glances and Zina of the ears is by listening (to evil) and Zina of the tongue speaking (about evil) and Zina of the hands is in touching (forbidden) and Zina of feet is in walking (towards evil) and the heart desires and hopes (in evil) and thereafter the private parts accepts that (acts upon it) or rejects it.' (Mishkaat pg.20)%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore, according to Shari'ah, to look, speak, listen, etc. to any Ghayr Mahram except at the time of extreme necessity is Haraam and impermissible. In an Aayat of the noble Qur'aan, Allah Ta'ala says, 'And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts.' Although the reason for revelation is a specific incident and the wives of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) are specifically mentioned but this is general for the entire Ummah, i.e. if the woman wants to get something from the men, e.g. utensils, clothing, etc. thus, she not come in front of him, rather ask for it from behind a veil. (Ma'aariful Qur'aan vol.7 pg.200; Idaaratul Ma'aarif) %0D%0A%0D%0AIn another Aayat, Allah Ta'ala says, 'And stay in your homes and do not display yourselves, like that at the time of ignorance.' (Surah Ahzaab 33 vol.33). Therefore, the command unto women is to stay at home and only come out at the time of a necessity which is sanctioned by the Shari'ah, should a need arise, total Shar'ee Hijaab should be adhered to. %0D%0A%0D%0ABy a person fighting his Nafs and saving himself from sinning, he will attain the sweetness of Imaan. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'A thought comes into a person to cast evil glances and who is that person who doesn't get these thoughts and his heart is also encouraging him to just take a look! But he fears Allah and saves himself by not casting an evil glance. This will cause a great burden but Allah Ta'ala will grant such sweetness of Imaan that he won't even consider looking in future.' (Ahmad vol.5 pg.264)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is, therefore, imperative that awareness should be created regarding the importance and laws of Shari'ah especially with regards to Hijaab and intermingling of the sexes, which is a root cause of many problems facing the society today. A general ruling of interaction between males and females cannot be given. It is restricted only according to need and necessity acceptable in the Shari?ah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
