  "question": "\"La ilaha illallahu allahu akbar walillahil hamdu bismillahir rahmanir rahim...\" What does that means? Do we actually need to say this?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhen I listened to the qirat of Qari Abdul Basit, I heard in-between the last ayaat of a surah and begining of another surah, he says (for certain surahs), \"La ilaha illallahu allahu akbar walillahil hamdu bismillahir rahmanir rahim...\"  What does that means?  Do we actually need to say this?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is pertinent to first understand the incident which occurred at the time of Rasulullah (Sallalahu 'Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nRasulullah (Sallalahu 'Alayhi Wasallam) was constantly mocked at by the polytheists of Makka.  Once the revelation of wahi was delayed upon which the polytheists criticized Rasulullah (Sallalahu 'Alayhi Wasallam) saying that verily the Lord of Muhammad has left him, dislikes him, and is angry with him.  Allah revealed the verses of Surah al-Duha refuting the false claims of the polytheist.  When Jabra’il completed the recitation of this Surah upon Rasulullah (Sallalahu 'Alayhi Wasallam), Rasulullah (Sallalahu 'Alayhi Wasallam) said “Allahu Akbar” out of gratitude to Allah for continuing the revelation after the brief pause and out of appreciation for refuting the claims of the disbelievers.  Afterwards, Rasulullah (Sallalahu 'Alayhi Wasallam) was commanded to recite this glorification (Allahu Akbar) upon finishing the Surah al- Duha in recitation along with the remaining Surahs until the end of the Qur’an.\n\nThere are many modes (qira’at) for the recitation of Qur’an.  According to some modes, it is necessary to recite this praise after the Surahs from al-Duha till the end of the Qu’ran.  Majority of the people in today’s time recite the Qur’an in the mode of Imam Asim from the chain of Imam Shatabi.  In this mode, it is not necessary to recite this praise between the Surahs.  Nevertheless, it is preferable to recite, especially if one is intending to complete the Qur’an.\n\nOne may recite any of the following:\n\nالله أكبر\n\nلا اله إلا الله والله أكبر\n\nلا اله إلا الله والله أكبر ولله الحمد\n\n \n\nTafsir al-Qur’an al-Azim of Ibn Kathir (4/674) Maktaba Dar al-Fiha’\n\nAl-Budur al-Zahira p.348 Qirat Academy Lahore\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
