  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nEvil thoughts are a sign of Imaan. The noble companions complained to Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallahu Alayhi Wa sallam) of evil toughts to which he replied by saying,%0D%0A'That is a clear sign of Imaan.'%0D%0AThe mind is like a highway. Today a king or pious person would pass over it,%0D%0Atomorrow a beggar or evil person will pass by. Similarly one experiences%0D%0Agood thoughts (of performing Salaat, reciting the noble Qur'aan, etc.), as%0D%0Awell as evil thoughts. One should avoid seeing or doing anything that invite%0D%0Asuch thoughts.If the thoughts are not articulated, one will not be%0D%0Aanswerable for them. Evil thoughts are like live electric wires. If one pays%0D%0Aattention to them by touching them, he will get shocked.Similarly, one%0D%0Ashould ignore evil thoughts and engage in something useful. One may also%0D%0Aread 'Laa hawla Walaa Quwaata Illaa billahi al-Aliyy al-Adheem' (There is no%0D%0Apower - to refrain from evil - nor ability - to doing good - except with%0D%0AAllah, the Most High, the Exalted).%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
