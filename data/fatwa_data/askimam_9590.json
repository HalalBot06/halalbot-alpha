  "question": "After the first Jumma Azan, must we leave all worldly engagements in preperation for the Jumma prayer? Please clarify what tasks are immpermisable.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan we eat lunch after the first Azan which is said quite early? Does it come under preperation for Jumma prayer, since it is difficult to concentrate in an empty stomach?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta?ala says, ?When the call for Salaatul Jumu?ah is made, then hasten to the remembrance of Allah.? (Surah Jumu?ah)\n\nThe call of Jumu?ah referred to in this verse is the first Adhaan of Jumu?ah. It is not permissible to engage in any activity that will delay one from going for Jumu?ah Salaat. If one is extremely hungry, he should eat before the first Adhaan. However, if one is faced with circumstances beyond one?s control and is so hungry that he will never be able to listen to the Khutbah and perform Salaat, then he will be excused for eating only that amount that will eliminate the severe hunger, to enable him to listen to the Khutban and perform Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
