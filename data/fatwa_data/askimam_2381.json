  "question": "Can I do hifz al Quran with the intention of paradise for my parents?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy parents arent the best muslims in the world. They pray salat once in a while but they follow all of the other pillars of Islam. I pray for their hidayat InshAllah and I pray for them to recieve Jannah because they have been great muslim parents. Can I do Hifz so they will be garunteed Jannah? JazakAllah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour intention for doing hifz must be for the pleasure of Allah. Your\nparents, Inshallah will receive what is known as (Sadaqatul Jariah) as\nstated in a hadith that when a person dies, all his actions terminate except\n3 things. One of these 3 things is a pious son that makes Du'aa for them.\n\nSo Inshallah if you continue to make Du'aa , may Allah accept you duas for\nyour parents and give them the highest status in Jannah . Ameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
