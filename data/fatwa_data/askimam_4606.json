  "question": "I’ve been married nearly two years and I’m not happy. Maybe we shouldn’t have married, everyone said we rushed in to it. I feel like giving up but we have got a son now. What can I do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy wife is a convert and when we met neither of us where practising. We used to get on before marriage, but now we don?t. I have got a very high sex drive and my wife used to satisfy it, but for over a year my wife has lost all interest in sex, she doesn?t even kiss or cuddle me. It is so bad I masturbate to stop me committing adultery. I have told her and she admits that she doesn?t want to come near me. It?s driving me crazy, we constantly fight and she has asked me to divorce her at least ten times. I look at other women and think that it would be better with them and sometimes I think it would be better without any. My parents divorced when I was 10 and my wife?s when she was 4, so we know how it affects children, but is it right to stay together just for the sake of the baby when we are so unhappy together?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Verily, the most detested\nact among permissible acts is divorce.' The consequences of divorce is\nindeed very grave especially after having a child. The innocent child also\nsuffers the consequences.\n\nWe, therefore, advise you to be patient and exercise extreme precaution in\nyour decision. It appears that your frustration is due to not being intimate\nwith your wife. That is a common problem among many women after birth due to\nthe biological change in them. The solution does not lie in divorce, but by\nattending to the problem by seeking professional, as well as medical help.\nWe make Du'aa to Allah Ta'ala that He guide you and alleviate your\ndifficulties, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
