  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy husband sent me the following message via his cell phone: 'You were rude to me so I am giving you a divorce.'\n \nDoes this constitute a divorce?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf it is confirmed that your husband sent you the message via the cell phone, then that constitutes one Talaaq-e-Raj’ee (revocable divorce).\n\n \n\n \n\nHe may verbally revoke the divorce by saying, ‘I take you back as wife’ or by being intimate with you.\n\n \n\n \n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
