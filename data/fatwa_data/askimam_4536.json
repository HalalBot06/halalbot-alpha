  "question": "Can a newborn's Aqeeqah be performed in absentia?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy husband and I are expecting our first child in June, InshaAllah and would prefer to send money to his family over seas for them to do the animal sacrific. Is this permissible? We are considering the need for the donated meat to be greater in his home country than the US.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible to perform the Aqeeqah elsewhere. It is not a condition\nthat the Aqiqah be perform in the vicinity of the child. Considering the\ngreater need elsewhere, it will be better to perform it at a needier place.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
