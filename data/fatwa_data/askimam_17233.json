  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am a student studying in the US. I recently took up accomadation with a Muslim friend near the campus and mosque. However, this apartment is owned by the church. I knew this at the time, but the apartment had a small minimum lease period and my friend and I needed that so that we could move to a better apartment after a short while. I wanted to ask whether it is permissible to stay in such a house since the money that I give the management as rent will most probably go towards church maintenance activites, church preaching activities, etc. At present, I have an option to move out to another friends place, but I have to leave this friend with whom I have established good relations. If it is permissible, is it better from a Taqwa point of view to move out at the earliest as this is what I feel.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is undesirable to hire the apartment belonging to the church.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalam\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
