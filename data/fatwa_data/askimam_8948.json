  "answer": "QUESTION\nThis question is related to question 8207. I contacted Guidance Financial for Islamic financing with the impression that it was Halaal. Ahmed Attia was the person to whom I spoke and after checking my credit history he came back to me with the pre-approval for the Finance. Later inorder to double check to make sure if the process was Hallal, I ran a search in Ask-imam.com and found your answer for question 8207. I would like to know the questionnaire you prepared and emailed to Guidance financial for their process clarification. That would definately help me and also if I can ask the same questionnaire to Ahmed Attia as he is in touch with me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTodate, I have not received any correspondence from the company despite their assurance that they will reply to my queries.\n\nMr Ahmad Attia is aware of our questionnaire. Kindly ask him why he has not replied to our correspondence. We have been waiting for over a year.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
