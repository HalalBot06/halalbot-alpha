  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am a MCA GRADUATE,my question is whether i can applay for the bank job,becuase the jobs in the bank surrounded by itrests.yhat is why iam asking ,or can i applay for the IT officer instead the clerk post?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nFirstly, Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) has cursed four types of people involved in usury. The one who takes it, the one who gives it, the one who writes the contract and the one who witnesses the dealing.\n\nSecondly, even if a one does not fall under any of the above mentioned (e.g. he is working for the IT department of a bank, etc.); he is still helping the bank in doing something prohibited by Shariah. Moreover, the wages paid by the banks are also from Interest money.\n\nTherefore, it is not advisable for a Muslim to take up a job at a conventional bank. He should adopt halaal means to earn a living and always try to please Allah Taâ€™ala in all circumstances.\n\nAapke Masaail Aur Unka Hal Vol:6 Pg:243-251 (Maktabah Bayyinaat)\n\nTaqreer-e-Tirmizi Vol:1 Pg:39 (Memon Islamic Publishers)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nM.
