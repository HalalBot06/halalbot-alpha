  "question": "I live in chandigarh, India. Here, the people of Tablighi Jamaat says that you cannot learn Deen of Allah without going for 3 days, 40 days, etc.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThey say that this is the only way through which Muslims can do the work of Daawat. I work in private company where I get only one leave in a month. How can I go for 3 days or 40 days, leave alone 4 months. I am not against Tablighi Jamat but I do not agree with their views. There are also other means through which people can learn Deen and do the work of Daawat. Also, here the people of Tablighi Jammat do not mix up with the people who do not go for 3 days, 40 days etc. It is really surprising. Please explain your view. Your answer will be highly appreciated. Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is imperative to learn Deen and pass on whatever one knows. Also, it is the responsibility of every believer to enjoin good and forbid evil (Amr bil Ma'roof wan Nahy 'anil Munkar). From our experience, taking part in the activities of the Tabligh Jamaat. It is an excellent way towards achieving this and has proven beneficial around the world. Although it is not necessary to go out for 3,10 40 days etc. if one is committed, it is never detrimental to do so. One may still involve oneself in the community based and local activities of the Jamaat.\n\nIt is indeed strange that the brothers of the jamaat in your area do not mingle with the rest of the community. As far as we are aware, the seniors of the movement have always encouraged involving oneself in and mixing with one's community.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
