  "question": "As an Imam should withold certain information, for example.....Am I obligated to tell the male that is interested in this female about her experience",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am an Imam and Hafiz. A lot of people in my community come to me and ask for advise. I try to be thorough and helpful as possible. At times it can be challenging. I have a case right now that is somewhat difficult. A male is interested in one of the local females for marriage. He wants to know details about her previous marriage (it was just nikkah there was no ruksati). This girl's previous husband confided in me and told me why they spilt up. The reason was b/c they consummated the marriage which they were'nt supposed to b/c of the tradition. The parents found out and were outraged and caused problems that led to the break up. Am I obligated to tell the male that is interested in this female about her experience. As he is asking me if I know anything about her \"experience\" or inexperience\" status\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSince he is asking you in confidence, you should be clear and inform him of\nthe consummation, etc. This would not even be termed as Gheebat or\nbackbiting.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
