  "answer": "QUESTION\ni have been dreaming about deaths of my family members, first i saw i am dead, then was my dad, then was my younger brother and then my brother, this happened for continuous one whole week, today i saw my mom dead, i dont understand, what does it mean?? Dreaming about death, death of family members. Please tell me what does it mean, good or bad i want to know. Assalam-alaikum Mufti Sahab, i am a bit tensed and need ur help, its been a week now and Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is surprising that you are tensed with the different dreams of death. As a Muslim, you should be always conscious of death and life after death. This thought should never escape you at any time. It is actually the backbone of Islam and keeps you constantly guarded against wrong and evil. Regard those dreams as a reminder of death which is inevitable.\n\nYou should be tensed because of death, not because of the dream. A believer remains uneasy and concerned about dying with Imaan as it concerns the success of his eternal life.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
