  "answer": "QUESTION\nI  much benefitted from your previous answer to my question about milad and isti'ana, and differences of opinion. i just wanted to get one thing more cleared up. The folks at sunnipath, seem to give the impression that permissibility of using words like \"Yarasoolullah madad\" is the view of majority of ummah, and this view that u gave me was unique to deoband.  Is this true? or are there other scholars in other schools of thought who concur with deoband in this issue? can u give any sources or quotes to back up your answer?\n\n If everyone other than deoband is of opinion that such words mentioned above are permitted, then is everyone other than deoband out of ahlussunnah?\nI dont mean to irritate anyone, but im worried that deoband is not with sawad e azam (majority).\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is important to understand a fundamental issue regarding substantiations in Shari’ah. The order and sequence of substantiations is as follows: a) Qur’aan, b) Hadith, c) Ijmaa and, d) Qiyaas (analogy)\n\nMajority ruling as a substantiation follows far beyond the four fundamental substantiations. It is only when there are no substantiations preceding that and there are differences of opinion among contemporary Ulama. The issue in reference, saying ‘Yaa Rasoolullah’ and seeking help from Rasoolullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] is clear. Only Allah is Omnipresent and we seek the help of Allah Alone. It is obsolutely incorrect to regard Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] as Omnipresent and address him as ‘Yaa Rasoolullah’ with that belief. It is also incorrect to seek the assistance of Rasoolullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and address him as ‘Yaa Madad’. The prohibition of these two issues are clearly in the very first source of substantiations – the Qur’aan. There is no need to consider the issue from an angle of majority view. Consider this – Allah condemns Kufr whereas the majority of the world is in Kufr. Will that make Kufr correct?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
