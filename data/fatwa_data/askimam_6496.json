  "question": "If an Imam makes a mistake while reading a surah after al-Fatiha is the prayer valid?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf an Imam makes a mistake while reading a surah after al-fatiha is the prayer valid? 1) if no one corrects him since the muqtadis do not know the surah he is reading. 2) what if the mistake changes the meaning and since the Imam and followers are non-Arabic they are unaware of the meaning. 3) the Imam becomes aware of the mistake and tries to correct himself but cannot remember and none of the muqtadis is able to help. If the Imam starts reading a surah then before completing three ayats he cannot remember the next ayat. 4) Can he start another surah? Is sajdah sahoh needed. 5) If he has completed three ayats can he go into ruku after a brief pause trying to remember.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Errors are of two types, a) Errors that do not change the meaning of the\nverse, and b) Errors that change the meaning of the verse\nIf the Imaam makes an error that does not change the meaning of the verse,\nthe Salaat will be valid. It will not be necessary to repeat the Salaat.\nHowever, if the Imaam makes an error that changes the meaning of the verse,\nthe Salaat will be invalid and it will be necessary to repeat the Salaat.\n2. If the Imaam forgets the next Aayat, he may proceed to another Surah, or\nif the minimum amount of Qiraat which is 3 Aayaats was reached, he may\nproceed to Ruku. In such a situation, Sajdah-e-Sahw will not become\nnecessary.\n3. If the Imaam forgets the next Aayat and paused equivalent to reciting the\nTasbeeh three times, Sajdah-e-Sahw will become necessary\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
