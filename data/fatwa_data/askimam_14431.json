  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nis zakat obligatory to woman on some of her so called belongings like gold as a gift from in-laws, when she is not earning and dont have any source of money\n\nwhen a women is not earning herself and she has gold as gift by in-laws(which she cant use by her will even,and not permitted to sale a portion of it to pay zakat)and she dont have any source of money, in this condition is zakat obligatory to her or she can give after sometime when she gets money.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nZakaat is compulsory on gold and silver. Zakaat will be obligatory on the gold if its weight exceed 10 Mithqals (87.48 grams). Zakaat is one of the five pillars of Islam. It is an integral part of Islam. Zakaat is compulsory upon people who have the Nisaab of Zakaat, and a whole year passes on the Nisaab. Once a year passes and a person does not pay his Zakaat, they will be answerable to Allah for disobeying his command.\n\nIn the enquired case, if the jewellery was given as a gift to the woman it belongs to her. She is the sole owner and she could do as she wishes with the jewellery. The in-laws cannot prevent her from selling the jewellery. It is understood that it may not a moral thing to do but the laws and obligations of Shariâ€™ah will override that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
