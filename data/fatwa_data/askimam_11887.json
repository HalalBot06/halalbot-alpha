  "question": "I had a boyfriend last 2 years ago, I broke up I really miss him so can I have a dua to forget him. I am trying to start my new life.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou should bear in mind that intermingling of the sexes before marriage is completely haram. If you wish to have peace of mind and lead a clean Islamic life, then it would be necessary for you to follow the dictates of the Shari?ah and break off all ties with Ghayr Mahram males.\n\nMake du?aa to Allah to protect you and your chastity and be regular with your Salaat, Dhikr, etc. May Allah make it easy for you to forget your past life and start off an easy Islamic life.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
