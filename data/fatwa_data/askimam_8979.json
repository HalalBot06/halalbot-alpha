  "question": "1. I have question regarding Tasbeeh Tasbeeh by hand is better than using the tasbi, 2.if my Salah is valid when I pick up my son. I have to keep an eye on him in case he falls down.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1- I read somewhere that 2 do Tasbeeh by hand is better than using the tasbi. So I do Tasbi Fatima e Zahra by hand afer every Salaat. But I usually say every tasbeeh a few times more (like subhaanallah - not 33 but 37-38 times, similarly for Alhamdulillah & Allahu Akbar) in case I dont count properly. Is it Ok or is it Bidah? even after I count it correctly, my heart says I may have missed 2 or 3, that is why I say it a few more times. Please tell me if it's ok, or do I have 2 do it correctly- 33, 33 & 34 times only? 2- I have a 1 year old baby. Its difficult for me to concentrate in Salah because he climbs on me during Sajdah & I have to keep an eye on him in case he falls down. Is it allowed for me 2 pick him up during Salah or prevent his fall, etc.? I will have to move from my praying place. Do I have to repeat my Salah or is it valid? 3-Please check the site www.duas.org . It has many Duas & I would like to tell my friends about this site. But almost all of them mention only Hadhrat Ali or Jaafar & not other Sahabis. Even the e-mail I sent 2 the website asking if they followed Shia or Sunni was returned. The links page has many Shia sites. And if u find that the site is unreliable, at least tell me if the page containing the Attributes of Allah is correct or not. The link to it is http://www.duas.org/nallah.htm\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If this is done because of a genuine doubt, it would be excused. (Shaami vol.1 pg.531). However, one should not entertain such doubts too often. In fact, using the Tasbeeh in this case would be more effective.\n\n2. One is allowed to control a child in Salaat if there is no Amal-e-Kathir (extensive movements) involved and one?s chest does not turn away from the Qiblah. You may even take few steps if the need be as long as your chest does not turn away from the Qiblah. (Shaami vol.1 pg.627)\n\n3. All Shi?a sites should be abstained from totally.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
