  "question": "Is it allowed to get married in Safar Month?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAOA.Is it allowed to get married in Safar Month as somebody told us that it is called month of sorrows for Holy Prophet(P.B.U.H) . Is it true? We have no way out due to some family problems. Some body told us never ever gets married in Moharram and Safar and is we will do it we will never get the good results of that marriage. Please guide us\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPeople used to think that it is bad luck to get married in the month of Safar. Hence, Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] said, ?There is nothing in Safar.?\n\nFrom the above, we should understand that in the religion of Islam, no one month is month of sorrow, whether it be Muharram or Safar. (Tanjimul Ashtaat vol.3 pg.144)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
