  "answer": "QUESTION\nAre there particular surah?s I can read or zikr I should do? Please pray for my unborn child that it be a healthy, happy, pious and obedient slave of Allah(swt), free from shirk\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou should turn your gaze to Allah Taala and engage in any zikar or dua you%0D%0Aare comfortable with. Hadhrat Faatima (Radhiallaahu Anha) reports that when%0D%0Ait was time for her to deliver her child, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) sent Hadhrat Umme Salmah and Hadhrat Zaynab (Radhiallaahu Anhumaa)%0D%0Ato me with the advise to read Aayaatul Kursi, Surah Falaq and An-Naas and%0D%0Athe following verse of the noble Qur'aan,%0D%0A%0D%0A'Indeed your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in Six%0D%0ADays, and then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (really in a manner that%0D%0Asuits His Majesty), He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it%0D%0Arapidly, and (He created) the sun, the moon, the stars subjected to His%0D%0ACommand. Surely, He is the Creation and Commandment. Blessed is Allah, the%0D%0ALord of the Aalamiin (mankind, Jinn and all that exists)! (A'araaf 54)%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah grant you an easy and successful pregnancy and grant you a healthy%0D%0Achild to be a coolness to your eyes and heart. Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
