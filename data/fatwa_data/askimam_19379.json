  "question": "My mother is unable to fast due to illness. Is there any way to compensate by giving some sadaqa or zakat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDue to my mother’s illness, she cannot fast. Is there any way for her to repay for her fast? For example a Zakah she should pay.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nIf your mother is experiencing such an illness that she is unable to fast, due to her deteriorating health, then she will be excused from fasting. If she is expected to recover from her illness, then she has to make up (Qadhaa of) these missed fasts.\n\nHowever, if the sickness is permanent and there is no hope of recovery then she must offer fidya (monetary compensation) for every missed fast.\n\nThe value of this Fidya is the same as Sadaqatul fitr, which is the value of 1.6 kg of wheat or 3.2 kg of barley. The present average value of 1.6kg of wheat is R17.00 .\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nFaisal bin Abdul Hameed\nStudent, Darul Iftaa\nCanada\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\n\n(2015-07-05)\n\n_____________\n\n(Bahishti Zewar Vol. 3 Pg 20 ; Haashiya Tahtawi ala maraqi al falah Pg 688)\n\n \n\nأن المريض إذا تحقق اليأس من الصحة أي صحة يقدر معها على الصوم فعليه الفدية لكل يوم)حاشية الطحطاوي على مراقي الفلاح شرح نور الإيضاح ص: 688("
