  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs cheddar Cheese Halal? I've heard from some people that it is makrooh, and from others that it is haram.\nCan you explain in detail what the makrooh means?\nI would like to know that if a male person has not had a wet dream, but he reaches the age of 15, is he baligh?\nIf you have a wet dream, and in the dream the semen comes out, but upon waking up, there is no sign of semen, is a bath obligatory?\nCan you explain what kashf is, I know it has something to do with seing stuff in your dreams, but can you explain it in detail?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Kindly contact a local Halaal body in Canada regarding Cheddar cheese.\n\n2. If a male turns 15 and as yet did not experience a wet dream, he will be considered as Baaligh. (Shaami vol.6 pg.153)\n\n3. If a person sees a dream and upon waking up, he does not see semen, then Ghusl will not have to be made. (Ibid vol.1 pg.164)\n\n4. If a person sees a dream and when he woke up, he saw Mazi (precoital fluid), this necessitates Ghusl. In other words, it would be Fardh to make Ghusl.\n\n5. Kashf literally means ‘to open’. Figuratively, it refers to when a Wali comes to know of certain mysterious things either in his sleep on while awake. If these things are in conformity with the Shari’ah, they are acceptable. If not, they have to be rejected. (Bahishti Zewar)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
