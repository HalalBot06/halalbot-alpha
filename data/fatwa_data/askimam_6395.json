  "question": "What is the preferrable age for a boy to get married?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) What is the preferrable age for a boy to get married? 2) Is it allowed to give thalaq to wife if she stops the husband from going to Jihad?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, 'He who has%0D%0Athe ability to marry, should do so.' (Mishkaat).%0D%0AThere is no specific age or time by rule at which one should marry, however,%0D%0Afrom the teachings of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) we are taught that%0D%0Aone should not delay. After a person matures and once he becomes responsible%0D%0Aand it is easy for the necessary arrangements to be made, he should%0D%0Aimmediately get married. This may vary according to difficult individuals.%0D%0AGenerally, one average in our times, approximately 20 - 21 should be a good%0D%0Aage.%0D%0A2. From the outset, we must understand that Talaaq is most hatred in the%0D%0Acourt of Allah Ta'ala. This earns the anger of Allah Ta'ala. When a dispute%0D%0Abetween both spouses occur, all sorts of effort for reconciliation should be%0D%0Athoroughly looked into. Nevertheless, going for Jihaad is not compulsory%0D%0Aupon every single individual at present times whilst to fulfil the rights of%0D%0Aour wives is compulsory. It will, therefore, not be permissible to give the%0D%0Awife Talaq merely becase she stops the husband from Jihaad. Instead, there%0D%0Ashould be understanding between husband and wife. The husband should make an%0D%0Aeffort to inculcate good qualities in his wife, making her understand Jihaad%0D%0Aand all other aspects of Deen so that when Jihaad does become compulsory,%0D%0Ashe will encourage him to go forward.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
