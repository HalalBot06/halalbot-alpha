  "question": "On which day is Saiy performed on Hajj, and what does it involve?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am doing a project at school and I cannot find the answer to this question. I would be very grateful if you could help me by answering my question. Thank you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nSa'ee literally means a brisk walk. In the context of Hajj and Umrah, it\nrefers to briskly walking seven times between the two hills, Safa and Marwa.\nWhen Ismaaeel (Alayhis salaam) was thirsty, his mother Hajra (Alayhis\nsalaam) ran in search of water between those two hills.\n\nSa'ee in Umrah is done after performing one complete Tawaaf of the Ka'bah.\nSa'ee in Hajj depends on the type of Hajj one wish to perform. If one\nundertakes to perform Tamattu or Qiraan Hajj which is preceded by an Umrah,\nthen Sa'ee will be performed as part of the Umrah. Sa'ee is performed again\nas part of Hajj after Tawaaf-e-Ziyaarah which is done after pelting the\nJamaaraat (Shaytaan) on the tenth of Dhul-Hijjah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
