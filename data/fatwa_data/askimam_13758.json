  "question": "is it specifically permissible to use contraception because one wants to spend some quality time with his wife",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nyou have provided many reasons as to when it is permissible to do family planing and when it is not....what i want to ask you is that is it specifically permissible to use contraception because one wants to spend some quality time with his wife for a couple of years after marriage? Jazak'Allah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe real purpose of entering into Nikah is to have children. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] is reported to have mentioned, ‘Marry women who are loving and who bare many children, because this will be a source of happiness for me on the day of Qiyaamat.’\n\nFrom this Hadith, it is clearly evident that the purpose of Nikah is to have children. The use of contraceptives for ‘quality time’ are concepts created by the west. As believers, we submit before the will of Allah. Thereafter, whatever He wills is totally in His hands.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
