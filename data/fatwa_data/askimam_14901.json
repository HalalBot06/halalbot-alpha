Explain to us in detail. We will be able to assist thereafter. Also advise us where are you from and is there a local ulama body there? Which aalim do you know?\nYou may continue the practice on condition you do not regard that as compulsory in deen. Ya Qawiyyu is meant to strengthen the ones memory. Ya Nur is meant to strengthen ones eyesight.\nWhat will you do if you have an offer to earn one million dollars in a short time daily? Will you still present the excuse of being lazy? The rewards of the different amals and wazifas supercede many million dollars. Rasulullah (S.A.W.) said, to just say Subhanallah, that will fill the scale (with reward) on the Day of Qiyamat. To say Subhanallah and Alhamdulillah fills up the area between the sky and the earth.  The difference is the reward in the world is cash and the reward in the hereafter is not visible, but the reward of this world is temporary and the reward in the hereafter is permanent. Your imaan and belief and conviction in the hereafter should give you the strength to fight off laziness and work hard.\nThe following is prescribed to save ourselves from black magic and other evil effects:\n\na)      Recite Yasin in the beginning of the day.\n\nb)      Remain in the state of wudhu.\n\nc)      Perform five daily salaah.\n\nd)      Recite Aayatul Kursi after each salaah.\n\ne)      Recite Surah Mulk at night.\n\nf)        Recite four Quls and blow on oneself before sleeping.\n\ng)      Recite Quran as much as one can.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
