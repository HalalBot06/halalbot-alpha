  "question": "Is fasting accepted without the will of parents valid? 3)Also how do alims and alihmas earn money? Do they teach in madrasssas or what?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI wanted to know if fasting is accepted without the will of parents? Because Alhamdulillah I want to practice Islam and follow sunnah complete and I fast every Mondays and Thursdays and know I can do it but my parents told me that they are very much NOT happy with me fasting like this. They are worried about me but I know that I can fast. Allah subhan o tala has given me the power. But they don?t understand(and probably don?t listen either when I tell them and think I am young and I don?t know). Are my fasts accepted? 2) Inshallah in the future I want to become an Alimah. I live in London. Do you know any darul olooms for becoming Alimahs (not alim) over here in London or anywhere near in uk? If you do then plz say so for I searched but failed. If non in uk then tell me one in anywhere?. 3)Also how do alims and alihmas earn money? Do they teach in madrasssas or what?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) encouraged fasting on Mondays and Thursdays. If you have the ability to keep these fasts, then you should do so. You state your parents are not happy for you to fast on these days, that must surely be due to their love and concern for you. They may be concerned about your health. If so, you should consider their advise. If you are unable to fast and that is having an effect on your health, then you do not have to keep these fasts. However, all the fasts you kept against the wishes of your parents are valid.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Those Ulama that are wealthy, for example, coming from affluent families earn their income from their family businesses. They serve the Deen of Allah on a gratis basis to earn the pleasure of Allah. Not all Ulama are privileged with that gift and do not have the financial support of their families. Many such Ulama adopt their own means of income and also serve the Deen of Allah on gratis. They do not take any remuneration for their services. There are also those Ulama who do not have the means and the time to generate their own income as they are engrossed in serving the Deen of Allah. If they have to earn their own income, it would be difficult to serve Deen. Their spare time will not be sufficient to serve the many avenues of Deen. It is in the interest of the Deen of the community to fulfil the needs of such Ulama. They should contribute with the spirit of serving Deen and not in the spirit of paying the Ulama for their services. They should hold the Ulama in high esteem and appreciate their services. They are a means of preserving the Deen of Allah and the Imaan of people which is essential for their eternal salvation.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
