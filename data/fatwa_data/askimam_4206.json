  "question": "Salaams, mufti desi is it permissible to swim while while one is fasting? Is it permissible to play video games Eg: sony playstation",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is permissible, however, it is not advisable because of the great\npossibility of water entering one's system.\n2. No, it is definitely not permissible to play video games in Islam. Many\nthings that are prohibited in Shari'ah are found in such games, e.g. music,\nanimate objects, wasting of precious time, negligence towards Ibaadat, etc.\nThese are just but a few of the wrongs found in this trivial pursuit.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Hussain Mehtar / Moulana Imraan Vawda\nfor: FATWA DEPT."
