  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat are the Shar'ee criteria to define any foods\nas Halaal / Haraam?\n\nIs the certification of Halaal authorities, MJC, SANHA, NIHT, etc. a Shar'ee criterion of determining any foodstuffs as Halaal or Haraam? The inconsistent rulings of Halaal and Haraam on the same product from the different Halaal authorising bodies is indeed confusing.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHereunder is our standard response to a similar query.%0D%0A%0D%0AQ: What are the Shar'ee criteria to define any foods%0D%0Aas Halaal %2F Haraam? Is the certification of Halaal %0D%0Aauthorities, MJC, SANHA, NIHT, etc. a Shar'ee%0D%0Acriterion of determining any foodstuffs as Halaal or%0D%0AHaraam? The inconsistent rulings of Halaal and Haraam%0D%0Aon the same product from the different Halaal%0D%0Aauthorising bodies is indeed confusing.%0D%0A%0D%0AA: According to the Shari'ah, the criterion to%0D%0Adetermine any food as Halaal or Haraam is the%0D%0Ainformation (khabr) of an Aadil person. (Hidaaya vol.4%0D%0Apg.454; Ashrafiyya)%0D%0A%0D%0AAn Aadil person is a Muslim who is known to abide by%0D%0Athe laws of the Shari'ah and is not a Faasiq (person%0D%0Awho transgresses the laws of the Shari'ah). Therefore,%0D%0Aif the owner or manager of a food outlet who is well%0D%0Aaware of the Shari'ah laws of Halaal and Haraam%0D%0Ainforms that the food is Halaal, his information may%0D%0Abe accepted. His business does not have to be%0D%0Acertified by any Halaal authorising body. If the%0D%0Aowner%2Fmanager gives misleading information, the sin%0D%0Awill rest on him.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf the informer is a Mastoor (a person whose condition%0D%0Ais unknown), then one may apply his discretion to%0D%0Adetermine the information to be correct or not and%0D%0Afollow his Zann-e-Ghaalib (overpowering thought).%0D%0A(Ibid) The certification of any Halaal authority may%0D%0Aserve only as a guideline but is not a Shar'ee%0D%0Acriterion to determine anything as Halaal or Haraam.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
