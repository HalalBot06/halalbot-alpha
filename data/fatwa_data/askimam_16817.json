  "question": "Many Mosques are used to make du'a after prayer which is bid'at",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMany Mosques are used to make du'a after prayer which is bid'at according to your fatwa because it replace the sunnat and that's not good however the Mosque I go we pray fard salaat after that everybody recites silent for their own Ayatul kursi, 33x Subhan Allah etc. if everybody is done and there are sunnat prayers that is going to be prayed then everybody does that first if it's like Asr after fard there is no sunnat then we again make collective du'a which is AFTER the sunnat du'a which everybody does after fard prayers so is this still bid'at? Because we make the sunnat by saying the du'a silent everybody for their own but after we make again collective du'a.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIn the recent past the issue regarding dua after salah has been the subject of many discussions.
