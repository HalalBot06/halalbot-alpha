  "answer": "QUESTION\nI need to know what the Koran says about Israel. I am in this community and some Jews are asking questions about the Koran saying that the Koran acknowledges that Israel is the land of Palestine and the Jews are promised that in the Koran. They say it was mentioned in the Koran that David was promised Palestine and it was called Israel. They also say that God choose the Jews to inherit that land. Please give me information to help me. THANKYOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION AND MAY ALLAH GUIDE AND BLESS YOU FOR YOUR GOOD DEED.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nEvery claim made by the Jews is incorrect.\n\nThe Qur'aan does not; a) Acknowledge Israel belonging to the Jews, b)\nPromise David Palestine, c) State Jews inheriting Palestine.\n\nRather, the Qur'aan clearly states, 'Disgrace and poverty has been put upon\nthe Jews.' That is due to them being disobedient to Allah and His Prophets\n(Alayhimus salaam). Their success and dignity lies in accepting Islam as\nsome Jews did at the time of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), for\nexample, Abdullah ibn Salaam.\n\nWe advise Muslims politely explain Jewish individuals the reality of Islam,\nperchance, that attitude may be a means of Hidaayat (guidance) for some. Don\n't be rude and evil to them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
