  "question": "1. permissible to fast on friday only?? 2. explain hadith on fasting of aashura",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)If you keep a nafil fast on Friday, do you have to keep another fast with it either on Thursday or Saturday? My brother told me that I cannot keep the single fast of Friday (nafil fast). He said if you fast on Friday you have to either fast on Thursday with it or on Saturday. Please clarify. 2)I read this Hadith on 'Quraan.com'.Please explain the meaning of this Ahadith. Narrated Ibn 'Umar: \"The Prophet observed the fast on the 10th of Muharram ('Ashura), and ordered (Muslims) to fast on that day, but when the fasting of the month of Ramadan was prescribed, the fasting of the 'Ashura' was abandoned. 'Abdullah did not use to fast on that day unless it coincided with his routine fasting by chance.\" Does this mean that we cant keep fast on the 10th.If we do than we have to keep fast for one more day either 11th or 9th.And if we dont keep fast on the 9th or 11th with 10th are we commiting a sin .So it this Hadith correct? Jazakalah khairan.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. According to the Hanafi Madhab, it is permissible to fast on a Friday\nonly. There is a Hadith which prohibits a person from fasting on Fridays\nonly. According to the Hanafi Madhab, it refers to the early stages of Islam\nand is not effective anymore.\n2. It is correct that Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) ordered the Muslims\nto fast on the day of Aashura, but later on, when fasting of Ramadhaan was\nprescribed, it was no more obligatory but recommended. When it was brought\nto the attention of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) that the Jews also\nfast on this day (10th), Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)ordered the\nMuslims to oppose them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
