(Christian) please give me the information i really appreciate that Regards\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nTo have sexual intercourse in the back passage of a woman is a major sin.\n\nRasulullāh Salallāhu ̒alaihi wa Sallam said:\n\n                    \"Cursed is the one who has intercourse with his wife in her back passage.\"[1]\n\nTherefore, it is important to make sincere Taubah (repentance) and Istigfār (seeking forgiveness) for committing such an evil act and also to make a firm intention never to return to it.\n\nTo marry the Ahle kitāb (people of the book, i.e. Christians and Jews) is permissible[2]. However, one should think of the huge implications of such a marriage.\n\nFor example, If the husband is a Muslim, he would have to follow the commands of Almighty Allah by performing Salāh, reading Qurān and abstaining from sin; if he has a wife who is a non Muslim who is used to living a free life of mixing with Ghair mahram men, drinking, eating pork, listening to music and dancing, how then will he be able to fulfil his duties as a Muslims?\n\nMore seriously, what would happen when a child is born?\n\nChildren by nature follow the ways of their parents; As a Muslim, the father should ensure that his child follows the Deen of Islam, but how would he achieve this when the child is encouraged by its mother to attend church, dress un-Islamic, listen to music and eat pork?\n\nHow difficult would it then be for him to steer his children in the right direction?\n\nThese are issues that should be carefully thought of before getting married. However, since you have already made nikāh to this lady, it is your duty to present Islam to her and to the best of your ability, encourage her to embrace Islam. May Almighty Allah make this easy for you and guide her to the truth. Ameen.\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl.
