  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs salamu allaikum, i am 19 years old and i love a boy who is 20,n both of us are determined to marry each other.there is no problem from my Parents but his parents are not ready for our marriage,as they  want him to get married elsewhere,v cant stay without each other so we have decieded to marry in secret,without telling any1 in the family.my question is,if we marry secretly and then after few months or so if our parents agree can i marry with the same person again,so that we dont hurt the sentiments of our parents.because after they agree to get us married if they cum 2 know tht v r already married they wil finish all reletionships with us.what is the procedure n which nikah wil be jayaz.. Jazak allah..  \nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nSister in Islam\n\nAssalamu alaukum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh u\n\nYou are basing your question on the premise that the boys parents will agree to him marrying you.What if they don’t agree?\n\nYou are also taking a chance with the hope that the marriage will remain a secret.What if the secret is let out? Will the boy be dedicated to you and sustain the pressure of his parents or submit and discard you? Ponder over the questions of these questions and reconsider your intention to marry the boy without the approval of his parents.This will require some sacrifice and restraint but it will be better in your interest.\n\nNevertheless, the secret marriage will be valid.The second marriage will not affect the validity o the first secret marriage.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’ala knows best.\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n1. When the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\n2. The guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\n\n3. Education and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\n\n4. Islam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\n\n5. When one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\n\n6. Muslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\n\n7. We have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\n\n8. If you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\n\n9. If that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\n\n10. Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, \"When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit\".\n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
