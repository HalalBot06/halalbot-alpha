  "question": "How to make sajda sahw?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease tell me when and how to make sajda from certain ayaats in Quaraan.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen performing Sajda-e-Sahw, one must be in the state of Wudhu.\n\nIt is Mustahabb (desirable) to stand up and say 'Allaahu Akbar' without\nraising the hands and go straight into Sajdah. Read 'Subhaana Rabbiyal a`ala\n' 3 times, arise out of Sajdah and whilst standing up, say 'Allaahu Akbar'.\nThere is no Salaam after standing up. It is better to begin and end the\nSajdah from the standing position, however, it is also correct to commence\nand terminate it from the Jalsa (sitting) position.\n\nSajda Tilaawat should be made as soon as possible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
