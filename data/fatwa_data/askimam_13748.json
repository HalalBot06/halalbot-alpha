  "answer": "QUESTION\nI m a sunni muslim girl and I want to marry a guy who is a shia (a bohri) i just want to ask if a Sunni girl is allowed to marry a Shia ? He does not have any problem with my remaining a Sunni even after our marriage and that is why m ready to marry him too. He says he respects my part of faith and will never ask me to leave my faith plus he has agreed that i can make one our children sunni if i like.  2- This is going 2 b a love marriage if it takes place. I also want 2 make sure if we are allowed to have love marriages or is it haram in Islam ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe concept of a love marriage as generally understood and practiced does not have any basis in Islam. The following are some practices of a love marriage that are not acceptable:\n\n1. Free talk and free contact;\n\n2. Exchange of love gifts;\n\n3. Spending time together as husband and wife.\n\nIf the person you wish to marry is a Shi’a, he should be told to convert and become a Sunni. Shi’as cannot be trusted as they practice Taqiyyah, that is, holy hypocricy. For them that is an act of worship and reward. It is thus very unsafe to marry the person until he honestly and openly becomes a Sunni.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
