  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for your question.\n\nPlease elaborate what is preventing you from obtaining employment. Do you have any skills and qualifications which you can apply so that you can become self employed? Make sure to be very punctual with your five daily salaah and perform nafl salaah too, if you can. Recite the Quran daily and keep yourself constantly busy in zikr, (remember Allah Ta'ala constantly.)\n\nAlso recite, ?Allaahumma ikfiniy bihalaalika an haraamika, wa aghniniy bifadhlika amman siwaaka.?\n\nI await your reply. May Allah Ta'ala ease your difficulties and hardships, ameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n2SOCIAL DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
