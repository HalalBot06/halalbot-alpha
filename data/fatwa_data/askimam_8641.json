  "question": "If i go to milad celebration and there is only speech and may be food, SO will it be still a sin if i go with intention to listen to the speech? please help me.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe concept of Moulood (celebrating of the birth of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), has no basis in Shari?ah. Listening to a talk about the life of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is indeed a virtuous act.\n\nThis virtuous act, however, must not be associated with any un-Islamic factors, for example, intermingling of sexes, etc.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
