  "question": "wearing the pants past the ankle, without touching the floor, without pride acceptable? explanation of hadith # 1371 sahih bukhari",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs-salamu alaikum In question number 9284 it was stated: ?Furthermore, Islam teaches us to place the food on the ground and not upon something that is raised because we are in need of the food. Hence, we need to bend over to it and not raise it to us. (Faydhul Baari vol.4 pg.334). However, Allaamah Munaawi has stated that if this is not done out of pride, it will be permissible. (al-Kawkabud-Durri vol.4 pg.3-4)? the question I have deals with the last statement made by munaawi. There is a hadith that states (something to the effect), any clothes reaching below the ankle is in the hell fire. The reason the prophet did not allow this is because the people of mecca at that time would drag their clothes on the ground in arrogance, and with the mentality of ?I am wealthy enough to buy another pair, even if this one tears?. However, if one does not drag the pants on the floor, but simply wears them ontop of the sneaker/shoe, and they have absolutely no sense of pride in wearing their pants below the ankle/ontop of the sneaker/shoe is it okay. If I can tell u honestly, one hundred percent that wearing my pants in this way, signifies no pride at all, can munaawi?s statement be similarly applicable to this matter? Also, please state and explain the hadith number 1372 in sahih bukhari. It is regarding the number of people that will be allowed into jannah. Jazakullah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is narrated in the Hadith that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?The clothes of a Muslim is until half his chin. Whatever is below half the shin upto the ankles is permissible and no harm but whatever garment is below the ankle, then it is in the fire.?%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom this Hadith, it is clear that one may wear garments, i.e. pants, Kurta, shirt, etc. upto halfway between the knee and ankle. That was the way of the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) and Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). In some Ahaadith, the word ?pride? appears.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe majority of the Ulama say that whether it is worn with pride or without pride, it will still not be permissible because of the Hadith, ?Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, do not lower your pants below ankles, because it is from pride.? How can a person really see or know if he has pride? A person might feel or say he doesn?t have pride, then why follow the manner of those people that have pride? Rather, follow the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) and Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), you will be guided onto the straight path. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
