  "answer": "QUESTION\nDoes getting kicked out of Islam and/or coming back in break wudhu? If a person says or does something that kicks him from Islam then make shahada, can he pray if he had wudhu before getting kicked out of Islam or while he was out?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a Muslim has Wudhu and come out of the fold of Islam, thereafter, he\naccepts Islam, his Wudhu will still remain intact if there were no other\nfactors that broke his Wudhu.
