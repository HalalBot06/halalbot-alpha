  "question": "I lead the Salah of a congregation without wudu. How can I compensate for this?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI once led Salah in which I felt as if something may have come out of my penis during Salah. I thought of it as some sensation which was presenting to distract me from my Salah so I took no notice of it and completed the Salah. However, on completing the Salah, I checked and found that the mazi was present. At that time due to my stupidity and inexperience being 16yrs of age, I reassured myself that it happened after the Salah was completed and shunned the thought. Now 3yrs later I understand the seriousness of my action and I want to make amends by fulfilling a compensation for my foolishness like qadhaa for example. But I don’t think that I can read qadhaa for the people who prayed behind me.\n\nIs there anyway that I can compensate on behalf of those individuals? I fear the consequences of my sin in the akhira. I’m not in contact with those individuals and I’m not sure who prayed behind me. Please give me some advice.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nWe are pleased to hear that you are concerned regarding your Salah as well as the Salah of others who prayed behind you.\n\nYou have stated that you are not in contact with those musalli and are not sure who prayed behind you. If you know who prayed behind you and you come in contact with them, then it is your responsibility to inform them to repeat their Salah.\n\nIf you do not know who prayed behind you and neither you come in contact with them, then you must do Istighfar as much as possible.\n\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Abdul Hannan Nizami,                            \nStudent Darul Iftaa\nUSA\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
