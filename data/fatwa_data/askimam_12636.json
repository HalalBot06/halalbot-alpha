  "question": "Kissing the thumbs upon hearing the name of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nReference to your Question No. 10797 in which you said Kissing the thumbs upon hearing the name of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has no basis in Shari?ah. A Book Named ?Ja?Al-haq? by Mufti Ahmed Yaar Khan (Pg. 394) wrote that it is mustahab to kiss the thumbs upon hearing name of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and he referenced some books like: Shami, Kanz-ul-Ibad, Kitab-ul-Firdous. He wrote that in all these books it is mustahab to do this act. Secondly, Imam Sahawi writes in his book Maqasid-e-Hassanah that this was the habit of Hazrat Abu Bakar (R.A). Please do answer this. I really appreciate for the time you give to our questions. May Allah reward you for this. Do remember all of us in your prayers. JazakAllah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe haven?t located any authentic source which proves this act to be Mustahabb. The basis of those who claim that this is Mustahabb is the narration that says this was the habit of Sayyiduna Abu Bakr [Radhiallaahu anhu].\n\nAllaamah Sakhawi [ra] had stated in ?al-Maqaasidul Hasanj? (pg.384 Hadith1021) that some people quoted this to be the practice of Sayyiduna Abu Bakr [Radhiallaahu anhu], but this is unauthentic and incorrect. Therefore, one cannot conclude that this is Mustahabb based on this unreliable narration only.\n\nAllaamah Shami [ra] after quoting the verdict of some who claim that it is Mustahabb, later quoted others who refuted its authenticity.
