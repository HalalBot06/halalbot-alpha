  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease advise in detail as i feel if i dont make a decision soon my imaan will be lost forever.I wanted to marry a girl of my own choice which i had been seeing for 3 yrs, i deeply regret this and want to desparately to not commit any more sins. My parents convinced me in whatever shape or form (force or emotional blackmail) that this marriage is not going to take place and took me to Pakistan to get married. this was the first time i saw my parents cry infront of me and beg me to agree to what they say. So i did. Now i get very depressed and dont no what to do as i still see the girl i wanted to get married to. i feel very ashamed and disgusted that i cannot make a decision as i have read many of your replies 'keep with principle or release with principle'and have increased my ibaadat. I have tried to talk to local imaams but cant seem to do so , my hands are shaking as i write this question. Please mufti sahib help me to make the right decision.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt appears that you finally married in Pakistan and considering divorcing your wife as you wish to marry the girl of your choice.\n\nIf our understanding is correct, we advise you exercise restraint in divorce. Ask yourself the following questions; a) Why do I wish to divorce my wife? b) What is wrong with her? c) Am I influenced in my decision by my love for the girl? d) If so, what guarantee do I have that a reverse situation of divorce will be any better?\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
