  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI live in Germany and some of my Muslim friends leave the Zuhr and Asr prayers due to inavailibility of a proper praying space. It is also difficult to pray these prayers in Ramadan. If one leaves his prayers while fasting, does the fast remain? Because of the same reason of lack of mosques close to the working place, can one join the prayer of Zuhr and Asr and offer them together just for the sake of leaving the office only once. Please clarify.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nTo perform the 5 daily Salah is Fardh. The order of performing salah is replete in the Qur’an and Ahadith. A Muslim should make every sacrifice to perform his 5 daily salats. Consider the following Ahadith\n\n1) Rasulullah (Salla Allahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said, \"The first thing a person will be accounted for on the Day of Qiyamah (Judgment) is Salah.\n\n2) Rasulullah (Salla Allahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said, \"The difference between Iman and Kufr is leaving out Salah.\n\n3) Rasulullah (Salla Allahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said, \"Salah is the foundation of Deen. Whosoever leaves out Salah has broken the foundation of Deen.\"\n\nThe above Ahadith are clear on the importance of Salah. Salah may be performed anywhere, not necessarily in a Masjid or a Musalla. The excuse of not having a proper place to perform Salah is not valid. Salah could be performed in a secluded area of the office or anywhere outside the office. There is no reason to be afraid or shy to openly perform Salah. If fact, such an attitude will earn Muslims respect in the sight of non-Muslims and also serve to encourage other Muslims in a similar predicament to openly perform Salah. It is not permissible for a non-traveler to join the Zuhr and Asr Salaats. However, you may choose to come out of the office at almost ending time of Zuhr and after performing Zuhr Salah, perform the Asr Salah when its time sets in.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
