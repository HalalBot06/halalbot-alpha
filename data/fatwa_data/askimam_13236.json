It has been reported by Hadhrat Aisha [radhiallaahu anha] that Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘If anyone of us complained about any pain, Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] used to pass his hand over that part which had pain and used to say, ‘idhabil ba-as rabbinnaas, washfi antas shaafiy laa shifaa-un illaa shifaa-uka, shifaa-un laa yughaadir saqaman.’ (Trans: O Allah, remove all harm, O Lord of the people, cure him for You are the Curer. There is no one that gives cure except You, cure that leaves no sickness at all.’\n\n2. Hadhrat Aaisha [radhiallaahu anhua] also reports that when anyone of us got any sickness, boil or injury, Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] used his mubaarak finger and read the following on those places of sickness: ‘Bismillaahi tawbatan aradhnaa wa reeqatan ba’adhinaa yasfiy saqamanaa bi idhn rabbinaa’ (Trans: With the name of Allah, the of our Lord, with the spit of one of us, with the will of our Lord, our sick man should get well.\n\n3. Hadhrat Aaisha [radhiallaahu anha] narrates that if any of the household of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] got sick, he [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] used to recite the two Quls (Surah Falaq and Surah Naas) and blow on them.\n\n4. Hadhrat Uthmaan ibn Abil Aas [radhiallaahu anhu] complained to Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] about the pain in his body. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Put your hand on that place of pain and recite 7 times ‘a’oodhu bi-izzatillaahi wa qudratihi min sharri maa ajidu wa uhaadhiru’. (Trans: I seek refuge in the honour of Allah and his power against the mischief of that pain which I feel and fear.’ Hadhrat Uthmaan ibn Abil Aas [radhiallaahu anhum] says, ‘I did as was commanded and Allah removed the pain.’ (Muslim)\n\n5. Hadhrat Sa’eed al-Khudriy [radhiallaahu anhum] reports that once Hadhrat Jibreel [alayhis salaam] came to Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and said, ‘O Muhammad, are you suffering from pain?’ Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Yes’. Jibreel [alayhis salaam] then recited the following: ‘bismillaah arqeeka min kulli shay-in yu-udhiyka wa min sharri kulli shay-in aw ayn haasidillaahi shafiyka, bismillaahi arqeka’ (Trans: I blow on you in the name of Allah so as to drive away all (your sickness). May Allah grant you cure from the mischief of every jealous when his jealousy becomes active and from every evil eye.’\n\n6. Hadhrat ibn Abbaas says that Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] used to read the following du’aa on his grandsons, Hadhrat Hasan and Husain [radhiallaahu anhum], ‘a’oodhu bikalimaatillaahit taammaati min kulli shaytwaan wa haammat wa min kulli ayn laammat.’ (Trans: I seek the protection of Allah’s perfect word against every Shaytaan and venomous creature and from every evil eye which cause harm.’ Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said that your father Hadhrat Ismaail and Hadhrat Ishaaq [alayhis salaam]\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
