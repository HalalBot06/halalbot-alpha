  "question": "Is it possible to pray in a mosque where there is a tomb in front or below it?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nRecently, I am very very confused of praying in Sultan Mosque and Hajjah Fatimah Mosque, both in Singapore, as there are tombs in front of the mosque. It was said to me by some of our muslim brothers that praying in a mosque where there is a dead person's tomb in front is haram. Thus, some of the muslim brothers are not praying in the mosque and creating a big issue. They say that they follow the Rasulullah (SAW) mosque in Medina. Is ther such a hadith saying this? Is it possible to pray in a mosque where there is a tomb in front or below it? Or is it the intentions which determines our prayers? Please help me with this. Thank you. May allah help you with this as he knows best.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIn the masjid of Rasulullah ( sallallahu alayhi wasallam ), people stand behind the roza of Rasulullah ( sallallahu alayhi wasallam ) and face the roza and perform salah. The intention is not to prostrate before Rasulullah ( sallallahu alayhi wasallam ). It is to make sajda to Allah. According to our understanding the tombs in front of the masjid are out of the masjid. In that instance, there is nothing wrong in performing salah in such a masjid. The intention is not to prostrate before the tomb.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
