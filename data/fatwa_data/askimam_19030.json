  "question": "What are the rewards of discharging Zakaat during Ramadhan?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWe calculate our due zakat and fitrah  money in the month of Ramadan and we accumulate  it with  parents then our parents disperse that money to needy people time to time before next Ramadan.( the concept for this that in the month of Ramadan all eligible muslims paid their zakat to needy people but after the month of Ramadan very few people paid their zakat to needy people, so to lookafter  their needs after Ramadan we disperse  amount  according to their needs( marriage, funeral, medicine etc.) from that accumulated money.\n\n \n\nMy question is when will our zakat actually will paid off from our heads either in Ramadan  or when that money is received by that needy people. Do we get sawab 70 times more  or not.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\nIn principle, zakat should be discharged as soon as it becomes due on a person without delaying. However, there is scope to discharge the zakat later in time, if there there is some valid excuse i.e. if needy (zakat eligible) people are not found.\n\n(Fatawa Shami, Vol.2, Pg.272, Saeed)\n\nZakat will only be paid off when the Masraf (the person whom zakat is given to) gains possession of it. If the zakat is discharged in the month of Ramadhan,  then it will be rewarded 70 times more.\n\n(Fatawa Darul Uloom Deoband, Vol.6, Pg.100, Darul Isha’at)\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best \n\nAbdur Rahman Shareef,\nStudent, Dārul Iftāa Mahmudiyyah\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
