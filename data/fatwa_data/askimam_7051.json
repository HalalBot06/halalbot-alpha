  "question": "Please could you advise me, with regards to eating at a non Muslim owned outlet certified Halaal by one of the 4 main Halaal organisations.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have doubts of eating at such places because it is non Muslim owned, but i am told by other Muslims, that i can eat there because it IS halaal, please advise\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a food outlet is owned by a non-Muslim but managed by an upright and reliable Muslim who is conscious of his Deen and knows the laws of Halaal and Haraam, then it is permissible to eat from such an outlet if such a Muslim manager claims the food to be Halaal.\n\nThe clarification of any Halaal body is not a Shar?ee prerequisite to determine a food outlet to be Halaal or Haraam. it is merely a guideline.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
