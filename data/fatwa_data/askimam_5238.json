JazakAllah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible to raise the hands and pray at the Qabr. This is proven\nthrough the practice of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). (Ahsanul\nFataawa part4 pg.234)\n\nIt is desirable (Mustahabb) to recite the Qur'aan, Azkaar and Du'aas at the\nQabr in a low voice. To recite these is a loud voice is Makrooh.
