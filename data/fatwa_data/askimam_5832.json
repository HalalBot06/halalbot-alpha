  "question": "What are the rules regarding how a Khutbah should be delivered?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn my college the khutbah tends to be 30--45 minutes in length. Sometimes I feel that this is too long. Are there any Islamic provisions for the length of a khutbah?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, 'To lengthen\nthe (Jumu'ah) Salaat and keep the Khutbah concise, is a sign ot\nintelligence.' (Muslim vol.1 pg.286; Qadeemi)\n\nFrom this Hadith, it is clear that the correct procedure is to shorten the\nKhutbah and lengthen the Salaat.\n\nThe Fuqahaa have stated that the duration of the Khutbah on the day of Jumu'\nah, from the commencement of the first Khutbah until the termination of the\nsecond Khutbah should last the time it takes to recite any one Surah from\nthe Tiwaal-e-Mufassal (the Tiwaal-e-Mufassal include all the Surahs starting\nfrom Surah Hujuraat and ending at Surah Inshiraaq.' (Shaami vol.2 pg.148)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
