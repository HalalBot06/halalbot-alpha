  "question": "there are no dogs currently present, but they have been there in the past. Is my prayer accepted if the bedroom is clean?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy problem is as follows: When I am not staying with my father, I live in an apartment within another house.  This house has had two dogs run through it.  The apartment is pure, but I am unable to do this with the rest of the house.  Is my prayer in this apartment accepted?  Lately, I've been doing these prayers outside instead of in the apartment.  Also, when I am at my father's house, the same question applies but with my bedroom in place of the apartment room.  In both of these residences, there are no dogs currently present, but they have been there in the past.  Is my prayer accepted if the bedroom is clean?  The nearest Masjid is some 30 to 45 kilometres away, so it is an inconvenience to pray there always.  Must I pray outside in both these residences?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe mere presence of dogs in a house does not make the carpets impure. It is the saliva of the dog that is impure. As a matter of precaution, you should vacuum-wash the carpets. That will be sufficient and you could perform salah on the carpet. If that is difficult you could perform salah on a musalla or any piece of cloth on the carpet. There is no need for you to perform salah outside your apartment.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
