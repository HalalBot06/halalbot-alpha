  "question": "I want to go for jihad,but work prohibits me to do so,what could I do to go for Jihad as soon as possible",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJihaad literally means to make an effort and strive. There are different ways of Jihaad. Allah Ta?ala states, ?And those who strive in our path, we will certainly guide on your roads.?\n\nIt is clear that there are different avenues of Jihaad. If one is unable to make Jihaad in one avenue, he may do so in other avenues. The Jihaad against the Nafs is the foremost form of Jihaad. The Nafs is the most formidable enemy of a human being from within. The Nafs is the playground of the Shaytaan who approaches a human being in most deceptive ways and engaged him in things that keeps him away from the right path.\n\nIf a person makes Jihaad against his Nafs and exercises restraint from all evil, he engages himself in the worship of Allah and strives in calling the people to good, then that too is a Jihaad. The ultimate purpose of Jihaad is the pleasure of Allah. That can be achieved in different ways within one?s ability.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti E"
