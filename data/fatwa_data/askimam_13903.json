  "question": "Does safr namaaz apply to me even though I will be gone for more than 14 days since i follow the Hanafee Mathab?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI will be out of town for 16 days, of which 10 days will be in Egypt and the rest in Dubai . Does safr namaaz apply to me even though I will be gone for more than 14 days since i follow the Hanafee Mathab? Is there a difference between Hanafi and Shafee with respect to this situation as others on this trip are Shafee?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, one will be a Musaafir in Egypt and in Dubai as you will not be stationed for 15 days at one place. The person will have to make Qasr in his Salaat.\n\nAccording to the Shaafiâ€™ee Madhab, one will be a Muqeem in Egypt as he will be there for four days and more. If the person will be in Dubai for four days, he will be a Muqeem in which he will have to perform full Salaat. If he is in Dubai lesser than four days, he will be a Musaafir.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
