  "answer": "QUESTION\nI learnt duaa's after the Salaah from out booklets. But in the community I stay, they most of the time say a duaa that is common, but I can't find it in any book. Is there any theory concerning making Duaa's after salaam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is advisable to make Du?aas that are mentioned in the Qur?aan and Ahaadith. It is, however, permissible to make Du?aas that are not mentioned in the Qur?aan and Ahaadith if there is nothing incorrect in the Du?aa and that such a Du?aa is not regarded as compulsory.\n\nMany people engage in Du?aas which which are not in the Qur?aan and Ahaadith but the Du?aas have some incorrect wordings and meanings in them. It is, therefore, important to verify the words of such Du?aas from the Ulama of your locality.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
