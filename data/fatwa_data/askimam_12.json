  "question": "Can parents prevent their daughter from marrying a particular man?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf a mature girl wants to marry a boy who is neither self sufficient nor religious and has had previous extra marital relations with a girl, can the parents and family of the girl stop her from marrying that boy?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe parents of the girl have a responsibility to protect her from any possible dangers in life. If they feel that her life with the boy will be against her interest, they can stop her. However, being an adult if she differs with her family and secretly marries, her marriage will be valid. We advise that one also seek advice through Istikhaara (seek divine guidance): http://www.alinaam.org.za/isinfo/istikhaara.htm\n\nBy Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
