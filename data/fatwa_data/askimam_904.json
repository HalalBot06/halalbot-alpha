  "question": "Now-a-days alcohol is frequently used in perfumes, fragrances and sprays. Can we use them?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAlcohol has become a major part in the making or Perfumes and other things. Can we use them as alcohol is not permissible in Islam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible to use deodorants that contain alcohol from grapes or\ndate extracts. Such perfumes are impure and Salaat with it is invalid.\nHowever, if the alcohol is synthetic, it is pure and permissible to use.\nSalaat without washing off such perfumes will be valid. Sometimes, it\nbecomes difficult to differentiate between genuine and synthetic alcohol.\nThus, to be on the safe side, one should rather prefer using deodorants and\nperfumes that are labelled as 'alcohol-free', especially when such perfumes\nare easily available.\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
