  "question": "Is it allowed for females to wear pants and shirts inside the Abaya?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI wear jeans (pants and tight shirts) inside my abaya. I know that women are not allowed to dress like men, but when I wear them, no one can see me. I wear them just because I am comfortable in them and I like them and I am not showing myself to others. Am I still not allowed to wear them even though no ghair mahram can see me?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nIt is not prohibited for a female to wear the type of clothing mentioned in\nthe details of the question inside the Abaya.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
