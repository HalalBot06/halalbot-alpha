When a person wants to love somebody, then he strives to please that person. Therefore, the basic component which will inculcate love for Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) in one?s heart is to strive to bring about every single Sunnah a reality into one?s life which in turn will please Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The disunity is because of our own actions. We have to, first of all, bring our lives in complete conformity with the orders of Allah Ta?ala and the blessed lifestyle of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Treating others with respect, dignity and honour, being kind to one and all irrespective of colour, race or creed is part of Islam. We must learn to humble ourselves before others, respect our elders and have mercy on the young ones.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. We are Muslims at first and in principle to learn about Deen and to have basic knowledge about our religion is far more important than any anything else. We need to open up the books of history and look into the lives of the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum), how they spent their youth and what exactly did they do and leave behind as an example for us.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. When he committed the sin, he was brave enough, hence, now too, he must be brave enough to confront the person and ask for forgiveness. Do good to the person, befriend him, smile and greet him, make Du?aa for him and send gifts to him.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. This is a matter pertaining to the hereafter to which Allah Ta?ala Alone shall decide. Insha Allah, Allah Ta?ala will grant him his full reward.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. There is no set rule for this. It is a matter of personal choice. Every person?s capacity is different. Our Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) never saved anything for tomorrow, let alone the future months or years. One should live a moderate life.%0D%0A%0D%0A7. It is Waajib for men to perform Salaat with Jamaat. However, this does not necessarily have to be in a proper Musjid. If the Musjid is quite far and there is a Musalla (Jamaat Khana) close by, then it is sufficient to perform Salaat in the Musalla. However, if the Musjid is within easy reach and there is no valid excuse then one must attend the Musjid.%0D%0A%0D%0A8. No parent can force the child to do something which is optional. Yes, the parents should ?encourage? the child.%0D%0A%0D%0A9. Depending on how strong one?s relationship is with a particular person, he must most importantly use wisdom and foresight. Be kind, soft and lenient, smile and use beautiful words to explain to him the virtues of Jumu?ah and of the great significance of the day of Jumu?ah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
