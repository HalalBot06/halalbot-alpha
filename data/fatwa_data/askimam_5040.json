  "answer": "QUESTION\na) Is one supposed to recite anything in Qiyam (Fatiha or Surahs following it) in Zuhr and Asar salaats behind the Imam? If not.then that means one just stands there for four rakahs..isnt Salah supposed to be a means of building Iman..how can that be acheived if one is standing quietly in the whole Salah (Qiyam position)? b) If a Hanafi has been reciting Surah Fatiha in the Siri (silent) salahs.does he have to repeat them or make tawbah? c) Is there any evidence of \"Ijtimai Dua\" after Fardh Salah during the time of the Prophet (s.a.w)? Is it a Sunnah or Mubah act? Could u quote some hadith that shows us that the prophet(s.a.w) made dua and the sahaba said ameen? and after every salah? d) Is it permissible to give the skin of the animal sacrificed to members of deviant sects like Burelvis?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. According to the Hanafi Madhab, it is not permissible for a Muqtadi (one%0D%0Afollowing the Imaam) to recite Surah Faatiha or any other Surah in all%0D%0ASalaats. In Fajr, Maghrib and Esha, he should listen attentively and in%0D%0ADhuhr and Asr Salaats, he should remain silent.%0D%0ASalaat is the order of Allah Ta'ala. If Allah Ta'ala ordered us to perform%0D%0ASalaat in order to build our Imaan, then this can only be achieved if it is%0D%0Acarried out in the exact manner as Allah Ta'ala himself demonstrated it to%0D%0Aus via Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). The mere fact that Shari'ah has%0D%0Alaid down this law that one must be silent, in concentration, in Dhuhr and%0D%0AAsr proves that it is only in this way that we will reach the objective%0D%0Awhich is strengthening our Imaan. Allah Ta'ala in his wisdom knows exactly%0D%0Awhat is good for us but because we are weak, we cannot understand the%0D%0Areasoning behind every order of Allah Ta'ala.%0D%0A2. In principle, any mistake committed by the Muqtadi (one following the%0D%0AImaam) will be overlooked. The mistake of a Muqtadi does not necessitate%0D%0ASajda-e-Sahw nor does he have to repeat the Salaat.%0D%0A3. To make Du'a in any form (loudly, softly, collectively, etc.) and any%0D%0Atime (before, after Fardh Salaat, etc.) is permissible. While there are%0D%0Asubstantiations for the different forms and times of making Du'a, Shari'ah%0D%0Adoes not restrict the making of Du'a in those forms or times not%0D%0Aspecifically substantiated in Shari'ah. At most, making Du'a is permissible%0D%0Aand an act of great virtue and merit. It is not permissible to project a%0D%0Apermissible act as compulsory as this is projecting a wrong view of the%0D%0AShari'ah, thus, causing distortion of Deen.%0D%0ATo regard the collective Du'a after Fardh Salaat or Sunnah Salaat as%0D%0Acompulsory will be Bid'ah as that projects the incorrect image of Shari'ah.%0D%0A4. Yes, it is permissible. (Aap ke masaail vol.4 pg.211)%0D%0A%0D%0A%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
