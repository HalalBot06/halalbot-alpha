  "answer": "QUESTION\nMe and my wife have tried many ways to solve these problems but they seem to keep getting worse. My father has a good business and I have a good job and earn good money (Alhamdulilah) and can afford a separate house for my family (wife and child). Q1. Am I at fault if I leave my parent?s house to avoid any future problems with them? Q2. My father told me that if I leave his house then he ?won?t speak to me again till he dies?. 1. Is my father?s reaction acceptable? 2.Am I wrong if I leave his house against his wish to provide a peaceful life for my wife who can?t seem to live with them anymore?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs a son and married person, you have dual responsibilities ? as a son to your parents, as a husband to your wife. Your responsibility to your parents is to be obedient to them and serve them and your responsibility to your wife is to fulfil your marital rights to her which includes providing shelter for her privacy according to your financial means. %0D%0A%0D%0AWe advise in view of the prevailing circumstances, you live separately with your wife. It is obvious that your move will be difficult as you will have to face the emotions of your parents. That is relatively easier than the continuous fighting at home which may have permanent consequences. You will have to bring the courage and move separately. Time will heal the pain, hurt and emotions. Until then, you will have to be patient and be humble to your parents.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta?ala guide you in your predicament and bring about a peaceful future for you with your parents and your wife, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
