  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it correct to force one's daughter or son to get married to a person of parents' chice specifically just because the person choosen by the parents is a relative.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is incorrect for parents to force or impose on their children to marry a person of their choice. Parents may advise their child or an appropriate marriage partner. It is the childâ€™s Shari right to decide his or her marriage partner. However children should strongly consider the advice of their parents regarding marriage. Their advise is based on love their children. If the child is not inclined towards the choice of the parents after due consideration, then the parents should respect that and not force their child against his/her will.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
