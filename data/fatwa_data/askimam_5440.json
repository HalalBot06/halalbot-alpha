  "question": "There are people claiming that you have to take Ahad Hadeeth into Aqueedah if it Sahih.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is the Daleel for only taking Mutawatir Hadeeth into one's belief.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf the Aahaad Hadith is such that it is received and excepted by the ummat\namalan and qawlan (Ijmaa) then it will suffice. Ijmaa is a Qat'ee Daleel and\nis sufficient to prove Aqaaid.\n\nAccording to majority of the Ulama, the authority of a Mutawatir Hadith is\nequivalent to that of the Quraan. Universal continuous testimony (tawatur)\nengenders certainty (yaqin) and the knowledge that it creates is equivalent\nto knowledge that is acquired through sense-perception. Simply, Mutawatir\nHadith gives the benefit of positive and definite knowledge in which there\nis no doubt, therefore Mutawatir Hadith is used in the establishment of\nAqaaid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
