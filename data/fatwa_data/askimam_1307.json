  "question": "Obviously, in Islam contact between unwed man and female is prohibited. However, technically in Islam, at what point of contact is a woman's purity (virginity) lost?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am an 18 year old Muslim male. Unfortanately, i had an unIslamic relationship with a 19 year old muslim female for 3 years. We were extremely close and planned on getting married Islamically once we were financially able to. Recently, both sets of our parents found out about this and made us stop seeing each other. Both of us sincerely feel guilty about our actions and are repenting to Allah (swt). However this puts us in a difficult situation. My question is two parts. One, since a man is supposed to be married to a pure girl, Islamically should she marry me or another man whom she hasnot had haraam relations with? My other question is at what point in Islam is a woman's virginity lost? Unfortunately, we commited physical sins and came very close to having intercourse (astaghfurullah). At some point though, our conscience and guilt prevented us from completing the action yet there was still contact between both of our private parts. Are we still considered as virgins Islamically? Please answer this question as best as you can. Thank you\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for a man to marry a girl even if she lost her viginity.\nHowever in the referred case, the viginity is maintained.\n\nAnd Allah Ta`ala Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
