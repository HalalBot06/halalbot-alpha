  "question": "I would like to know if one can perform Salaah after having performed Ghusl, or is it a fard to take Wudu after Ghusl to perform salaah.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI read somewhere that Ghusl is the greater purification between Ghusl and Wudu. Doesn't this mean that if one has Ghusl, one automaticaly also has wudu, as wudu is a smaller purification ritual than Ghusl. Shukran for taking time to answer this question.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen a person performs Ghusl, normally his whole body is washed including the limbs of Wudhu.\n\nSo, in this case, by performing Ghusl his Wudhu will also be completed. However, if by performing Ghusl, the limbs of Wudhu are not washed, the Wudhu will have to be done separately thereafter. (Tahtawi)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
