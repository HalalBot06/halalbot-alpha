I have heard that digital images are not in the true sense pictures.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are differences of opinion among the Fuqahaa (jurists) regarding the definition of a picture.\n\nAccording to the majority opinion, a picture is in durable form, hence, digital pictures does not fall in the category of picture-making which is Haraam. since there is a difference of opinion, we advise that digital pictures should not be made or kept without need.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
