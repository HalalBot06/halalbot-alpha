  "question": "Is it permissable to have a clock in our home which chimes every hour with the tune of the \"Westminster Chimes\"?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe have a wall clock in our home which chimes every hour to the tune of the \"Westminster Chimes\". These chimes are heard in churchs throughout the world. Words to this chime are a Christian prayer, as follows:- \"Lord through this hour, Be Thou our guide. So, by Thy power. No foot shall slide\". Even though we do not use the clock to remind us of our prayers/islamic events etc, is it permissable to have the clock in our home? Should we remove 1 or 2 notes to make the tune 'imcomplete'?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe chimes of these westminster clocks are designed by Christians and are Christian orientated. They are meant to indoctrinate the mind with Christian beliefs and ideaologies. It is prohibited for a Muslim to keep such a watch.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
