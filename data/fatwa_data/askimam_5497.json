  "question": "I like this one boy, and I would like to know how would it be possible for me to let him know, so that we could marry each other someday?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari'ah, it is prohibited to have any contact with a Ghayr\nMahram (not prohibited in marriage) males before marrying the person.\n\nGhayr Mahram males and females must observe Hijaab with one another. It is\nthe non-observance of Hijaab that leads to many evils, among them, one is,\nfor example, liking the boy. You should make an effort to keep your distance\nfrom the boy and purify your heart and mind from that thought as that may\ngenerate many more evil thoughts, especially, in today's times of evil and\ncorruption.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
