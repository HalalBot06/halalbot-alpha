  "question": "Is machine slautering of chickens halal",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMechanical slaughter is of three types:%0D%0A1. Chickens are transported to the place of slaughter through a conveyer belt and are manually slaughtered. If there is certainty that the chicken is alive and the Muslim slaughterer recites the name of Allah upon slaughtering, then the chicken is Halaal. In this case, only the transportation is mechanical but the slaughtering is manual. This procedure is unanimously permissible and recommended.%0D%0A2. Chickens are transported by means of the conveyer belt to the mechanical slaughter blade. Once the mechanical plant comes into operation, the blade also comes into operation and cuts the chicken. This procedure is not permissible. It does not matter if the plant and the blades are controlled together or separately.%0D%0A3. The chickens are transported by means of the conveyer belt to many slaughter blades and every blade is controlled separately by a Muslim who recites the name of Allah upon effecting the mechanical slaughter. This procedure conforms to the principles of Shar%E9e Zabh set out by the Fuqahaa. According to our knowledge, such a procedure does not yet exist.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
