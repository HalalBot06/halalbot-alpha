  "question": "Who has more right to approve/reject a marriage offer for a girl whose father is dead: her mother or her stepfather? The father's relatives are absent (overseas).",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn this case, the stepfather insists on an Arab husband only. The mother and girl prefer a non-Arab religious brother who has proposed. The stepfather refuses the girl and mother to contact the non-Arab brother any more, because of his race. Is this his right? Can they disregard him?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf there is no way to contact or discuss with the father's male relatives in\ntime, then the right of guardianship (Wilaayat) rests with the mother in\ntheir absence. (Shaami vol.3 pg.78; HM Saeed)\n\nHowever, since this is a delicate issue, one should not make hasty decisions\nas this may have disastrous consequences. We advise that the merits of\nMashwarah (taking counsel) and Istikhaarah (seeking Divine guidance - check\nsite for details) be discussed with the family and then decide.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
