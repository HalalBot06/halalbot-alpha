  "question": "Iheard that one has to cover his/her private parts while taking bath/ghusl, as all evils resides in bathroom. Please clarify upto what extend shall we protect from unseen world?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nIf one is taking Ghusl in a place of concealment (where none can see him),\nthen it is not necessary to cover oneself. However, it is preferable and\nmore in conformity to the dictates of Hayaa (modesty) to cover one's private\nparts even while taking Ghusl (bath). (Fataawa Mahmoodiyah vol.4 pg.387;\nMazhari)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
