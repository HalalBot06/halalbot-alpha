  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam Alaikum, I have two questions to ask you. 1.Is is Ok to pray with your shoes on for example if u are at work? 2. Mashallah i pray five times a day and lately i have had wet dreams and doing things which are wrong and haraam (masturbating), now i feel guilty and ask for Allha's forgiveness. What is the best practice that i could do in order to not to do these unlawfull things. I know fasting is one of them, is there any duas or anyother things i could do. I really want to stop these things but sometimes satan bugs me i guess. Please try to help thanks.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There are some issues to consider regarding performing Salat with shoes at work; a) The bottom of the shoes will be dirty if not impure, b) Generally, the shoes today are large and unlike the shoes of previous times which were like chappals. That will affect the Sunnah posture of the Jalsa (Sitting between two Sajdahs) and the Tashahhud. In view of the above two points, we advise that you remove your shoes at work and perform Salaat. However, if you perform Wudhu and wash your feet and perform Salaat with your shoes, the Salaat will be valid.\n\n2. Refer attached.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
