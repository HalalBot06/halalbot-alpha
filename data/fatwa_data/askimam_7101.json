  "question": "40 Ahadith of Imaam an-Nawawi (RA) said to recite the surah fateha silently. what explanation has Imaam abu Haneefa (RA) has given in this regard?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI myself follow the understanding of Hadhrat Imaam Abu Haneefa (Rahimullah alaihi). I do not recite surah fatiha while I pray behind an Imaam as it should not be recited in the Hanafi madhab. However my question is, I read a hadith-e-Qudsi from the book of 40 Ahadith of Imaam an-Nawawi (Rahim ulah alaihi) in which it was narrated by a sahabi that Sayyiduna Muhammad (SAW) said to recite the surah fateha silently. Thus, the other school of thoughts do so. My question is what explanation has Imaam abu Haneefa (RA) has given in this regard? As the hadith clearly states to recite surah fatiha silently while praying behind the Imaan as said by prophet (pbuh) to that sahabi in that particular hadith. Another Question is, I have read a fatwa in your site that prawn is prohibited in Hanafi madhab as it does not belong to the category/species of fish. While in other 3 schools of thoughts prawn is allowed. So does it mean that it is a sin for a hanafi if he eats prawn? And it is ok to eat prawm for the other muslims of other 3 schools of thought? I don't no, I am really confused and just trying to understand. How something which is allowed in 3 schools of thoughts is prohibited to one school of thought? A question rises in my mind that, are the other 3 school of thoughts wrong in there statement saying that prawn is allowed? Or statement of hanafi school of thought is wrong in saying prawn as prohibited? Please clarify me these two questions in detail. Akramakum'Allah!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. There is a difference of opinion in regards to the recitation of Qiraat behind the Imaam in Salaat. Imaam Abu Hanifa (RA) is of the opinion that the Muqtadi should remain silent behind the Imaam. His proof is the Hadith, ?He who has an Imaam, the Qiraat of the Imaam is also his Qiraat.? The Hadith mentioned by you is interpreted differently by the Hanafi scholars.\n\n2. Here again, it boils down to difference of opinion based on Ijtihaad (extraction of Masaail from the sources). The Hanafis regard prawns as Makrooh (almost prohibited) whilst the others regard it as Halal. Now, only one school of thought is correct but since the Masalah is based on Ijtihaad, it is obvious that there would be a clash of opinions.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
