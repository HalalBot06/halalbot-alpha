  "answer": "QUESTION\nCould you also tell me the method of praying namaz-a-toobaah, because I think I've done something which is forbidden in Islam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOne has to make Qadhaa (make-up) for missed Fardh Salaats as well as Witr\nSalaats.\n\nWe advise all the missed Salaats be calculated and a daily schedule be drawn\nto make Qadhaa of all the missed Salaats. Insha Allah, by strictly following\nthe schedule, one will accomplish his responsibility of fulfilling all his\nQadhaa Salaats.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
