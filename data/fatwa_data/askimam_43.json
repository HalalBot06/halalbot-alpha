  "question": "Is going to school (as in studying math and science) Jihad?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI go to an Islamic school. One of the shieks say that studying at school is Jihad. Many other shieks say that it isnt. I am of the opinion that it isnt. What is your opinion? Could you please supply me with proof based on your opinion. Your answer is much appreciated.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJihaad literally means to sacrifice. Therefore, the Shaykhs opinion only in\nthe literal sense is correct. The reward of that sacrifice depends on the\ngood intention of the seeker of worldly knowledge, for example, contributing\nto the propagation of Islam. However, Jihaad includes physical and monetary\nsacrifice against the Kuffaar even to the extent of placing one's life at\nrisk.\n\nGenerally, the Qur'aan and Ahaadith refers to the latter understanding of\nJihaad.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
