  "question": "How should we split the rent amongst ourselves?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know how the rent should be split between four people for sharing a three room apartment. Two of them are a brother and sister living in one room. The rent is 700 dollars. There is one bath and one kitchen.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\nIt is permissible for the tenants to split the rent amongst themselves with mutual agreement.\n\nThe other two members having a room for themselves have a greater advantage over the brother and sister who share one room. This angle may be considered when deciding how to contribute towards the rent.\n\n \nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
