  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it correct in saying ‘salaam u alaikum’ instead of ‘asslaam u alaikum’.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe Islamic greeting, ‘Assalaamu alaykum’ is a salient feature in Islam. It is through this very greeting that people identify each other as Muslims and followers of the same faith. Salaam is the sunnah of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and it is a gift granted to this Muslim Ummah.\n\nSince this ‘Salaam’ is such a salient feature in Islam, utmost importance should be given to the correct pronunciation of this greeting, i.e. Assalaamu Alaykum. Allamah Nawawi [ra] mentions, ‘The least a person should do is say ‘Assalaamu alaykum’. If he just says ‘salaamu alaykum’ also it will be permisible, however, to say ‘Assalaamu alaykum’ is more rewarding.’ (Minhaaj vol.14 pg.365)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
