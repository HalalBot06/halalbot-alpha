  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs Salamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Dear Shaykh.I got married when i was 16 to my girlfriend to make our relationship Halal, later on we split up my uncle came round and i performed the Talaq all 3 in one sitting. Then i went abroad and got married again, Now since then i have seen my first wife and made love to her, she even got pregnant with my child. But we are not living together and she is married to another man since i left her, whom she hates and is only married for the sake of it. What do i do, is our Nikah still valid? or do i marry her again in order to see her again? Is the sex we had HARAAM!. Jazzak Allah Khairah for your time.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSince your friend wife is married to someone else and you divorced her 3\ntimes, she is not in your marriage anymore. To have any relationship with\nher will be unlawful.\n\nIf you do want to see her again, you will have to marry her again after she\nobtains her divorce from her husband.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
