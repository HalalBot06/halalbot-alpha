  "question": "If my father passed away & left his life insurance to my mother-does the money have to be evenly distributed amonngst my 3 brothers or does my mother make the decision to use as she sees fit?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy age at the time was 21 ,other brother 19 & last brother was 7 at the time\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAll types of Conventional Insurances are prohibited. The premiums paid towards the life insurance by your father forms part of his estate and must be distributed according to the Shariah Laws of inheritance and succession.\n\nThe estate of your father will be distributed into 24 shares- wife(your mother) will receive 3 shares. Each son will receive 7 shares. If your father was survived by either of his parents or both of them, then the number of shares will be different. The amount in excess of the premiums will not form part of the estate. It must be disposed off by giving in charity to the poor and needy.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
