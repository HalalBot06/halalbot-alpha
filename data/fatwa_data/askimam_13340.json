  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nHow children should act in the light of the following 2 verses. What are the limits of obedience and disobedience. 4.135. 17.23.\n\n4.135. O you who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even though it be against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin, be he rich or poor. 17.23. And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honor. For example if parents want their son/daughter to give/take divorce from their spouse with or without any just reason and if the son/daughter don’t listen, will it be disobedience to them. What r the limits of obedience and disobedience according to above verses. Please guide me with this situation according to above 2 verses. May Allah rewards you for this with his best (Ameen)\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe Hadith teaches us: ‘There is no obedience (required) when (this obedience) entails disobedience to Allah.’\n\nIn other words, when your parents instruct you to do something that tantamounts to disobeying Allah, you should politely and respectfully refuse to do so. If they force you to divorce your wife without any valid reason, you should not adhere to their unjustified request. This will not be treated as disobedience.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
