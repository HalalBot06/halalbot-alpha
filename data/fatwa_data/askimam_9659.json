  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like to know is it okay according to Hanafi madhab, to marry with a woman making Allah as a witness? If the brother and sister fear of committing haram, they marry each other making Allah as witness? and when the appropriate time comes they marry openly\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA Nikah will be valid only if it was performed according to the Shari?ah law which requires the presence of two male witnesses or 1 witness and two female witnesses.\n\nIf the boy and girl proposed and accepted to marry without the required Shar?ee witnesses, then the Nikah will not be valid. Fear for Allah demands following the laws of the Shari?ah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
