  "question": "There has not been any nation on Earth as strong as America (it is claimed). Are there any Ahadith that point towards this 1500 years ago?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe have not come across any Hadith referring to that. However, the Qur'aan\nspeaks about the might and strength of the nations of Aad and Thamud.\n\nAccording to the descriptions of might and strength of the nations of Aad\nand Thamud in the Qur'aan, they superceded the might and strength of America\nbut Allah Ta'ala destroyed them within moments of time due to their\ndisobedience in Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
