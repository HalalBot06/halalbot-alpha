Thereafter, the stage was to teach the people about Islam and have them fully aware about Islam.\n\nToday, we are at such a stage where the people are unaware of Islam. We have many different schools of thought. Hence, there is a greater need to educate the people and forward ourselves to establish a Khilaafat. If the people are not educated, we will have great opposition to the Khilaafat. We want to bring the people to Islam and not have people fighting in Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
