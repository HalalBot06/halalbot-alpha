  "question": "We live with my 2 brothers and parents. My wife cannot maintain the hijab all the time and we have limited privacy. I want to move out. What are my responsibilties?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n. We want to host Islamic classes, attend lectures. Her responsibilities are enormous in the house with all the cooking, cleaning, making lunches, rasing 2 daughters. She looses all enthusiasm to do any Islamic activity and I too become discouraged.- My daughter watches a lot of TV. My wife gives in because it relieves her of the tension to watch her amidst all her other activities- My parents feel that I am most likely to care of them in the long run since my younger brothers have more of a Canadian lifestyle. I am more traditional and feel obliged to live them\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf you have the financial ability to live separate, you should do so as providing a separate shelter is the right of your wife. Somewhere on this site, search 'I want to live separate' (without quotes)\n\nBy living separate, the difficulty of Hijaab and tv will be immediately resolved. You will be able to inculcate and maintain an Islamic environment at home. As regard to be of service to your parents, that remains your responsibility and you should do so to the best of your ability within the framework of Shari'ah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
