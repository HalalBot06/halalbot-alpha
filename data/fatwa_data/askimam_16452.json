  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy wife has a bit of bushy eye brows, which I don't like that much. Can I ask her to trim them?\n \n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nNabi صلى الله عليه و سلم curses those women who trim their eyebrows. Abdullah ibn Masood رضى الله عنه reports that he heard the Messenger of Allah صلى الله عليه و سلم curse those women who do tattooing, those you make a gap between their front teeth and those women who trim their eyebrows, those who change the creation of Allah Ta’ala.” (Nasai  2/292 Qadeemi)\n\nعن عبد الله قال لعن رسول الله -صلى الله عليه وسلم- الواشمات والمتفلجات و المتنمصات المغيرات خلق الله عز وجل . ( سنن النسائى ج 2 / ص 292 قديمى كتب خانـ )\n\nTrimming the natural hair of the eyebrows is prohibited even if it seems to be dense and bushy. If there is a real need, at the most it will be permissible to remove only the stray strands of the hair around the eyebrows.\n\n \nحاشية ابن عابدين 6/373\n\nاحسن الفتاوى 8/75\n\nآب كــي مسائل 7/141\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
