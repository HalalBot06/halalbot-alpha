  "question": "How do i do Dua for someone?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI always question myself if I am doing such and such right or wrong, and it causes me to become a bit paranoid sometimes. And something that came to my head based upon that thinking was if I am doing du'a for others correctly. When one says \"Do du'a for me,\" how do we do that? What do I say in such a du'a? It is very confusing. Do I just wish them well or say \"ya Rab, I wish them well or accept their du'as?\" Basically, I wish to know how does one do a basic du'a for another when they say \"do du'a for me.\" Thank you for your time and dedication and I look forward to your response inshAllah.\nJazaakallaahu Khaira\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nThe easiest way is to make duaa on the turn when the person asks you to make dua for him. You may forget to make duaa later on.\n\n \n\nThe dua you may make is “O Allah, forgive so and so”. Or “ Grant so and so Aafiyat”. Etc\n\n \n\nAlternatively, you may make a specific Dua based upon the circumstances of his request.\n\n \n\nFor example he is writing exams and you make dua, “O Allah! Make him successful in his exams”.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftāa"
