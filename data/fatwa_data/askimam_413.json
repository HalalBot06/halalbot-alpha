  "question": "The ruling is for talaq to be said on three differnt occassions and not 3 times on a single occasion nullifies the marriage. Surely Islam allows tolerance over an angry outburst?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a husband uttered the word, 'Divorce' three times in one sitting, it will\nbe regarded as three. The divorce will be irrevocable, kindly refer to our\nresearch three times (www.jamiat.org.za/isinfo/ttalaaqs.html).\n\nObviously, a husband issues divorce in the state of anger. If Islam was\ntolerant to the anger, then in the first place the divorce should not have\ntaken place. In fact, such a ruling is an eye opener to other husbands to\ncontain their anger. If they do not, they will suffer the consequences of\nnot containing their anger and being verbally abusive to the wife.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
