  "question": "Is Factoring permissible in Islam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nIs Factoring permissible in islam? Will the buyer’s transaction be affected if the seller is doing factoring? (with or without the buyer’s knowledge)\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nFactoring is a financial transaction whereby a business sells its Accounts receivable (i.e. invoices) to a third party (called a factor) at a discount in exchange for immediate money with which to finance continued business. (Wikipedia)\n\nThis concept of factoring is not permissible in Islam. The surplus amount received over and above what the debt was purchased for, is Ribā (interest).\n\n(Jadeed Fiqhi Masāil, Vol.1, Pg.424, Naeemiyyah)\n(Ahsanul Fatāwā, Vol.7, Pg.175, HM Saeed)\n\nThe buyer’s transaction will not be affected if the seller/supplier does factoring. The transaction between the buyer and seller is independent from the transaction between the seller and the factor.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n\n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftāa"
