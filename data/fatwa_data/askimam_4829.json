Why is Tableegi-jammat ideologies oppose to Jihad (fighting in cause of Allah). Jazak-allah khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is unfortunate that the Salafees are misinformed about the Tablighi\nJamaat.\n\nThe Aqaaid of the Tablighi Jamaat is according to the Aqaaid of Ahlus Sunnah\nWal Jamaa` as explained by Abul Hasan Ash'ariy and Abu Mansoor Maturidi.\nThey strictly adhere to the Shari'ah, Qur'aan and Hadith. They go around and\npropagate their Aqaaid and adherence to Shari'ah. They are certainly not\nopposed to Jihaad. How can they as that is an express ruling in the Qur'aan\nand Hadith.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
