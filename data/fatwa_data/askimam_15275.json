  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nis this following hadith is authentic hadith, please give it reference and authenticity\n\nHadith is, \"The Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) said, \"a woman who reveals her body or even wears tight fitting clothes won't come within 500 yreas of the smell of Jannah\".\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh  \n\nThe Hadith comes in the Mu’atta of Imam Malik with the following words:\n\n \n\nو حدثني عن مالك عن مسلم بن أبي مريم عن أبي صالح عن أبي هريرة أنه قال نساء كاسيات عاريات مائلات مميلات لا يدخلن الجنة ولا يجدن ريحها وريحها يوجد من مسيرة خمس مائة عام\n\nMalik narrates from Muslim bin Abu Maryam who narrates from Abu Saleh who narrates from Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallahu Anhu)that he said, “Women who are dressed but appear naked, who will be inclined (towards men) and make (men) incline (toward them).  They will not enter Jannah and they will not smell its fragrance where as its fragrance can be would be smelt from the distance of 500 years.\n\n \n\nIn most of the narrations of Mu’atta the chain reaches up to Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallahu Anhu) and not up to the Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam).  Only the chain of Abdullah bin Naafay reaches up to Rasullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam).  Regardless of the case, it will treated as a Marfoo’ narration (chain reaching Rasulullah), since the topic of the Hadith is not something which can be understood by analogy.  Therefore, Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallahu Anhu) must have heard it from Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam). (Awjaz al-Masalik 16:174)\n\n \n\n \n\nA similar narration also comes in Sahih Muslim and Musnad Imam Ahmed.  The wordings of Sahih Muslim are:\n\n \n\nعن أبي هريرة قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم صنفان من أهل النار لم أرهما قوم معهم سياط كأذناب البقر يضربون بها الناس ونساء كاسيات عاريات مميلات مائلات رءوسهن كأسنمة البخت المائلة لا يدخلن الجنة ولا يجدن ريحها وإن ريحها ليوجد من مسيرة كذا وكذا\n\nAbu Hurairah (Radhiyallahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) has said, “Two groups from the inhabitants of Hell whom I did not see. People having flogs like the tails of the ox with them and they would be beating people, and the women who would be dressed but appear to be naked, who would be inclined (toward men) and make men incline towards them. Their heads would be like the humps of the bukht camel inclined to one side. They will not enter Jannah and they will not fragrance its scent whereas its fragrance would be smelt from such and such distance.\n\n \n\nThis Hadith is authentic.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
