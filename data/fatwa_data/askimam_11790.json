  "question": "Is it permissable to offer a daily email service for a fee that contains excerpts of Hadith or Surah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTeaching and educating in the Shari?ah is an act of worship. In principle, it is not permissible to receive a remuneration in lieu of teaching Shari?ah. The jurists have permitted that only due to need and necessity as all people engaged in teaching Shari?ah, may not have a source of income to sustain themselves and imparting Islamic knowledge is imperative. The rule of necessity relaxes prohibition is applied. %0D%0A%0D%0AThe rationale of the abovementioned original principle is upholding the sanctity of the Shari?ah and Shari?ah not being commercialised. In the backdrop of the above, we revert to your query. %0D%0A%0D%0AIf it is possible for you to offer a daily service of verses of the Qur?aan or excerpts of Ahaadith, etc. then that is encouraged as it is propagating the radiance of the words of Allah and His Rasul [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam]. If that incurs costs, and you can bear it, then you will be greatly rewarded for it. The service should not be commercially motivated.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
