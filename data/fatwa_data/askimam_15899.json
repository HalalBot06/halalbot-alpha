  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1.  If I want to do umrah from my mother's side, can I make intention of my father's umrah in the same umrah or do I need to do two different umrahs from both of them?\n2. Can be do Umrah for our relatives who are deceased as well as who are alive?\n3.  My infant daughter (11 months) will be traveling with us for Hajj, Inshallah.\n a.  I heard that Qurbani is not necessary for her. Is that correct? We plan to do the niyyat for her Hajj too.\n b.  If my daughter scratches on my face or my beard and in the process pluck a couple of hairs, do I still need to give 'Damm', as I did not pluck my hairs intentionally?\n4.  We are planning to do more than one umrah, each day Inshallah (we will be staying for 6 days in Makka Inshallah) and then leave to Madinah. For every Umrah, do I need to go out till meeqaat and at the completion of each Umrah, do I need to shave my head, if I am doing multiple Umrahs, Inshallah?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1. Umrah is a nafl i’badat. One may perform one Umrah and make intention of giving the reward to many people. However, if someone had specifically requested to perform Umrah on his behalf, then it is not permissible to make intention of more than one person in that Umrah.\n\nFatawa Raheemiyah Vol.8 Pg.143 (Darul Isha’at)\n\nفإذا أحرم بحجة عن اثنين أمره كل منهما بأن يحج عنه وقع عنه ولا يقدر على جعله لأحدهما ، وإن أحرم عنهما بغير أمرهما صح جعله لأحدهما أو لكل منهما\n\nRadul Muhtar Vol.2 Pg.608 (H.M. Sa’eed Company)\n\n2. It is permissible to perform Umrah on behalf of those who are deceased as well as those who are alive.\n\nAapke Masail aur Unka Hal Vol.4 Pg.51 (Maktabah Bayyinat)\n\n3. a) One of the conditions for Hajj being compulsory is that the person should be baligh (i.e. he should have attained the age of puberty). That is why hajj will still be compulsory on a person who performed Hajj before attaining the age of puberty.\n\nوالعقل والبلوغ والحرية إنما اشترطت هذه لما روي عن ابن عباس قال : قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم : [ أيما صبي حج ثم بلغ الحنث فعليه أن يحج حجة أخرى.....الخ\n\nHashiyat-ut-Tahtawi ‘ala Maraqil Falah Pg.727 (Darul Kutub Al Ilmiyyah)\n\nWe understand from the abovementioned that Hajj is not compulsory on your infant daughter; therefore, slaughtering of the animal will also not be compulsory on her behalf. However, if you wish to slaughter an animal on her behalf, then it will be permissible.\n\nb) If your daughter plucks a few strands of hair, then damm will not be compulsory on you. However, you will have to give a handful of wheat for every strand of hair that was plucked. \n\nوإن نتف من رأسه أو من أنفه أو لحيته شعرات ففي كل شعرة كف من الطعام كذا في فتاوى قاضي خان\n\nوإذا خبز المحرم فاحترق بعض شعره تصدق له ، وإذا حك المحرم رأسه أو لحيته فانتثر منها شعر فعليه صدقة كذا في السراج الوهاج .\n\n\nولو حلق الحلال رأس محرم بأمره أو بغير أمره كانت الكفارة على المحرم ولا يرجع بذلك على الحالق كذا في فتاوى قاضي خان\n\nFatawa Hindiyyah Vol.1 Pg.243 (Maktabah Rasheediyah)\n\n4. It is permissible to perform as many Umrahs as one pleases all through out the year. However, it is highly disliked to perform Umrah on the days of Hajj, i.e. from the 9th of Zil Hijjah to the 13th of Zil Hijjah.\n\nFatawa Raheemiyah Vol.8 Pg.145 (Darul Isha’at)\n\n( وجازت في كل السنة ) وندبت في رمضان ( وكرهت ) تحريما ( يوم عرفة وأربعة بعدها )\n\nRadul Muhtar Vol.2 Pg.473 (H.M. Sa’eed Company)\n\nSimilarly, it is not permissible for a person who is performing Hajj-e-Tamattu’ to perform any Umrahs after his Umrah for Hajj, until after he has finished all actions of Hajj, i.e. the 13th of Zil Hijjah.\n\nJawahirul Fiqh Vol.1 Pg.492 (Maktabah Darul Uloom Karachi)\n\nIf one intends to perform Umrah whilst in Makkah, or inside the boundaries of Haram, then it is necessary for him to go outside the boundaries of Haram. I.e. he should go to either تنعيم (Tan’eem) or جعرانه (Ji’irranah) and make intention of Umrah in these places. It will not be necessary for him to go till the meeqat.\n\nJawahirul Fiqh Vol.1 Pg.492 (Maktabah Darul Uloom Karachi)\n\nYou will have to shave your head on the completion of each Umrah.\n\n( وأما واجباتها ) فالسعي بين الصفا والمروة والحلق أو التقصير كذا في محيط السرخسي .\n\nFatawa Hindyyah Vol.1 Pg.237 (Maktabah Rasheediyah)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
