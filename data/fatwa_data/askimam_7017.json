  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe firm i work for are renevating the current premises, they are making provision for a jamaat kana on the ground floor, they intend to use this for Jummah, we are quite a few muslims in our area in centurion, as far as i am aware i recall that before a musjid can be used for jummah prayers it hasto meet certain requirments? are there any? what are they?are there no restrictions? i must also add, that there are many christians who work at our premises too, and that the closest mosque is about 15km from our office, in my opinion the firm wants to make a jamaat kana at the premises to save time on a friday.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, the prerequisite for performing Jumu?ah Salaat and its validity is that there should not be less than 3 persons besides the Imaam. Therefore, if there are more than three besides the Imaam, it will be permissible to perform Jumu?ah in the Jamaat Khana. (Shaami vol.2 pg.147).\n\nThe Jummu?ah Salaat performed at the Jamaat Khana on the premises will be valid. There should also not be any restriction for any Muslim wanting to perform Jumu?ah Salaat there.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
