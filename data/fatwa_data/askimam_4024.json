  "answer": "QUESTION\nI got married on February 2001. Do I have to pay Zakaat on my wife's Jewellery and the Share of her Father's Property (Assets for which Zakaat has to be paid viz., cash etc) since it hasn't been one complete year yet ? If I am not responsible who else is responsible ? -Jazakumullah khairan -Was Salam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf your wife was given the jewellery as an outright gift to her in February,\nthen she is liable for the Zakaat on the jewellery upon the expiry of one\nyear, being in February 2001.\n\nThe question of the father's property is unclear. Kindly elaborate.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
