  "question": "Is the statement that 'all vegetable dug up from the ground eg: potatoes, garlic can be considered as makrooh' true?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it true that if more that seven makroo items are being cooked in one dish(food) the dish(food) becomes haraam? Is there any Fathwa regarding the cracking of the knuckles?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. It is incorrect to make such a statement. Garlic and other such vegetables are 100% Halaal. Yes, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) avoided pungent smelling foodstuffs like onions and garlic due to their smell that would be offensive to the angels who brought Wahy (revelation) to him.\n\n2. We don?t know of any such thing.\n\n3. Cracking the knuckles weakens the joints and should thus be avoided. Doing so in Salaat is specifically Makrooh.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
