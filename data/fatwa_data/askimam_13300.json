The bride gives consent to her representative (Wakeel) in the presence of two witnesses to perform her marriage at the Masjid. At the Masjid, the Wakeel represents the bride in the presence of the two witnesses and the stipulated dowry. The witnesses must be two trustworthy and pious male Muslims who are not her ascendants e.g. father, grandfather or decendants e.g. son, grandson, etc.\n\nThe Mahr (dowry) is the woman's right and should be stipulated prior to the marriage.\n\nThe procedure of marriage via the internet is same as marriage by proxy where one of the partners (boy or girl) propose to marry the other. It is advisable that the proposal be written in front of two persons. However, this is not a precondition. (Shaami vol.3 pg.12; HM Saeed)\n\nThe two witnesses should also sign the document be sent to the other party, for example, in a foreign land and accept the written proposal in the presence of two witnesses. The presence of these two witnesses is a pre-condition. It is important to exercise extreme precaution by verifying the proposal and its witnessing to avoid any possibility of fraud and deception.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
