  "question": "s the nikah valid if the wali of the wife becomes her previous husband who gave her talaaq",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ns the nikah valid if the wali of the wife becomes her previous husband who gave her talaaq. I married a woman who was previously married. She was a new muslim so I did not find a wali for her and I did not have her present at the nikah. I made her write a note saying she agrees to nikah with me. Than I had her previous husband read the note in front of 2 witnesses at the nikah in the masjid. Than I performed my own nikah with her previous husband as the wali. So is my nikah valid\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nHer ex-husband merely acted as a representative in her Nikah. Anybody can act as a representative in Nikah.\n\nHence, your Nikah is valid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
