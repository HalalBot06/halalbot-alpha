  "question": "Can we pray sunnat at the time of zawal ? How many minutes actually the time of zawal ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. Can we pray sunnat at the time of zawal ? How many minutes actually the time of zawal ? Please explain if there is any ikhtilaf on this issue\n\n2. I heard the story of nabi adam a.s. that syaitan left his son with nabi adam. In short, Nabi Adam then eat the son of syaitan. One brother said he has read this story in a book, which might be : qisasul anbiya of ibnu katsir. Please clarify... If the story is correct, is that mean that in the blood of the son of adam inherits the bloods of syaitan ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. The Sunnats of Dhuhr follows the same principle as the Faraaidh of Dhuhr. The Faraaidh of Dhuhr can only be read after Istiwaa (Zawaal). Similarly, the time of the Sunnats is also after Istiwaa, hence, it is not correct to perform them at the time of Zawaal (Istiwaa). Zawaal in actual fact refers to Istiwaa. This is when the sun is at its zenith at midday. The time of Dhuhr begins after the sun passes its meridian (zenith).\n\n2. We have found no basis for the story. The book mentiones ‘Stories of the Prophets’ by ibn Kathir has no mention of this.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
