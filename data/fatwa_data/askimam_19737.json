  "question": "Is it permissible for me use Adsense for my website, or use a pseudonym while blogging or make a website for a music company?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI want to ask about following issues:\n\n1. Whether, it is permissible to run a site (about technology news) and earn from Adsense (sometimes google gives ads containing picture of people)\n\n2.Whether, it is permissible to write and post news & blog in a blogging site using a fake (or pseudo) name\n\n3. Whether it is permissible to develop a Site for company which deals with selling music & movie DVDs\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\n1.      It is permissible to run a website about technological news. You may also advertise on your website. However, you may only advertise such adverts which are in conformity with Shariah. Pictures of animate objects, especially women are impermissible. We would suggest that you tweak and customize your Adsense to display only specific adverts which do not show any images. This may inhibit your income levels but it will ensure that your income is completely halal and full for barakah.\n\n2.      There are many genuine reasons to withhold one’s information while interacting on the internet. Therefore it is not only permissible rather in most cases recommended that one does not use his real name. Similarly, one should be very cautious about providing ones real information online. However, if the position with which one interacts online is such that people have to rely on the person’s integrity and standing in real life, then it would be more prudent to use one’s real name.\n\n3.      Music and Movies are not permissible in Shariah. A website whose sole aim is to sell these items is a direct means to assisting in vice. Hence it will not be permissible for you to develop such a website.\n\n \n\nAllah Ta’āla says in Qur’an,\n\n \n\nوَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ\n\nAnd do not assist in sin\n\n(Qur’an 5:2)\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Faisal bin Abdul Hameed\nStudent, Darul Iftaa\nCanada\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
