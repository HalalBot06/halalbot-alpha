  "question": "Does frying Halaal food in vegatable oil which is also used for frying Haraam chickens at the same time make the Halaal food Haraam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShari?ah has emphasised on exercising precaution in Halaal and Haraam. If any outlet sells Haraam items as well, one should abstain as such an outlet cannot be trusted.\n\nIf the outlet sells only Halaal and is supervised by a trustworthy Muslim, then one may eat from there.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
