  "question": "My aunt breastfed me for a very short time. Can I marry her daughter?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSalam alai kum! My aunt once mistakenly breast fed me when i was a baby,thinking that i was her daughter(who is a week younger to me). As soon as she found out that it was not her daughter she removed me immdeiately.The length of this feeding might have been less than 2 minutes. What kind of relationship do i have with her daughter, is she mahram to me like a sister or can i marry her? jazak allah khair\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nYour aunt  is your foster mother since she breastfed you. This is irrespective of the amount of milk that you were breastfed. Even if it was very little, as long as it went down your throat, the foster relationship is established. Your aunt's daughter is your foster sister. Therefore, you cannot marry her daughter (i.e. your foster sister). [i]\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n__________\n\n\n\n قليل الرضاع وكثيره إذا حصل في مدة الرضاع تعلق به التحريم كذا في الهداية. قال في الينابيع. والقليل [i]\n\nمفسر بما يعلم أنه وصل إلى الجوف كذا في السراج الوهاج\nالفتاوى الهندية، ١/ ٣٤٢"
