  "answer": "QUESTION\nThis is not the case in real life, can u please explain what the dream means as it is upsetting my husband and myself.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThese are Shaytaani dreams. Shaytaan wants to sow the seed of discord\nbetween you and your husband by indoctrinating negative feelings about you\nin your husband's heart.\n\nYour husband should ignore the dream and recite, 'Laa hawla walaa quwwata\nillaa billaah.' He should not even discuss the dream.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
