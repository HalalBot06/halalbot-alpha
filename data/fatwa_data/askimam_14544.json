  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAre we allowed to pray for maghfirat of someone who has committed suicide? Can we read Holy Quran and send him/her the sawab?\n\nI know a person who just expired and was a Shia, since I do not know his exact beliefs, can I keep good faith in his beliefs and pray for his maghfirat or not? What should be my reaction towards the situation?\n\nIs it allowed for husband & wife to publicly hold hands or to hug each other in public? Is it allowed for them to kiss each other not in public but in front of other mehrams?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. It is permissible to make du’aa of forgiveness for any deceased Muslim. If a person committed suicide, that is a major sin. It is permissible to make du’aa of forgiveness for such a person.\n\n2. In principle, it is not necessary to make du’aa for a deceased Muslim. It is prohibited to make du’aa for a deceased non-Muslim. If a person was known to be a Shi’a, it is best to exercise caution and not make du’aa. If he is a true Muslim in the sight of Allah, then at most you did not fulfil a desired act but if he is a non-Muslim is the sight of Allah, and you made fu’aa for him, you would be guilty of committing a prohibited act.\n\n3. Shame and modesty is an integral part of Islam. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Shame is a great branch of Imaan’. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Imaan and shame and inseparable colleagues. If one is absent, the other is also absent.’ A husband and wife should express modesty in their relationship. It is against shame and modesty for them to hold hands and kiss in public.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
