  "question": "Can i use interest money to pay my College fees?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAsslamu alkum,if i use intrest  for paying fees of my college and i get job on behalf of acquiring knowledge from that particular college, would my salary be halal.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful \n\nInterest money should be disposed off by giving it to a poor and needy person. If you fall in the category of a poor and needy person and qualify to receive zakat, then you may use the money to fulfill your personal needs that includes college fees. Your income through your knowledge and skills will be halal for you.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam  \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
