  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI heard that if u want to become rich or u desire to become rich that u can recite surra Muzammil and surra waqia, is it correct.\n\nIf it is correct wht is the procedure of doing so at wht time we can receite this,has it got any specific time for recitation,\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nTo be rich or poor is by the sole decree of Allah. Allah gives wealth to whoever He wishes. There is nothing wrong in making dua to Allah for wealth. Wealth is the bounty of Allah. There is no mention of reciting sura Muzammil or sura Waqiah for becoming rich. This may be based on someoneâ€™s experience or observations. One may follow the experience of others.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
