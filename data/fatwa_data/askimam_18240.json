  "question": "Can i write Quran with my left hand?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ndear aalim my question is that can i  write quran from my left hand? because i write with my left hand and now iam doing a amal in which i have to write surae Ahzaab and keep it in home but iam a lft hander? so can i do that?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatuallahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nIt is preferable that a person carries out all noble deeds from his right. In a narration of Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, Ayesha (May Allah Ta'ala be pleased with her) has said,\n\nحدثنا حفص بن عمر قال حدثنا شعبة قال أخبرني أشعث بن سليم قال سمعت أبي عن مسروق عن عائشة قالت  : كان النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم يعجبه التيمن في تنعله وترجله وطهوره وفي شأنه كله\n\n\n“Nabi صلي الله عليه وسلم loved his right when wearing shoes, combing, for his purification and in fact for all good.”\n\nHowever, if a person is unable to write with his right hand he will be excused and it will be permissible for him to write the Quran with his hand.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
