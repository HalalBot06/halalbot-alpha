  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni like a girl and have never asked her or proposed her now as its my age for marriage how can i pray to ALLAh for her as i really want to marry her ....is there any wazifa for this\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf you like the girl and have the means to marry, then you should make mashwara (consult) with appropriate people regarding the suitability of the girl as a wife. Also make istikhara and seek Divine guidance regarding marrying her. If you are satisfied with marrying her, then you should propose for her. If the girl is in your taqdeer, you will marry her. Condition your mind to accept whatever is the outcome. Our Iemaan is on taqdeer. Our lives evolve within a divine design. It is part of Ieman to accept and be happy with taqdeer.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
