Can I send gifts to my fiance, I don't talk to her over phone or Email as suggested by you, but can I send gifts to her through internet? Our parents have no problem with it. 5. Taking dowry. The brides father is adament that he must give it to his only daughter. I consider it a social evil and Haraam because it creates problem for our poor brethern who can't afford it. Who is right in this case.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. These customs have no basis in Islam, hence, they must be abandoned. There is no such thing as ?Baraat? in Islam. The Nikah should be plain and simple.\n\n2. This is an innovation which must be shunned.\n\n3. Refer 2 above\n\n4. It is permissible as long as you do not have any contact with her at all.\n\n5. Please rephrase this question. It is unclear.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
