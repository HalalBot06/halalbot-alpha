  "answer": "QUESTION\na friend of mine has not offered salat for past 5 years,either knowingly or due to negligence. now,after spending 40 days in tabligh jamaat,he says he wants to repent.how should he repent?any special duaa?also,now he is in college,so if he performs qadhaa salat after completion of education,is it ok?i told him offer 1 qadhaa after each fardh salat but he told that he wants to offer all nawaafil and sunnat salaats as well.he is trying to bocome a pious person.kindly answer as early as possible.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is commendable to note that your friend intend to perform. May Allah Ta?ala grant him Istiqaamah (steadfastness).\n\nWe suggest he performs the Qadhaa as soon as possible. What if waiting for him to complete college and the in the interim passes away, what will be his lot with regards to the missed Salaats. Therefore, immediately he should start making Qadhaa of the missed Salaats and not wait for completing college. There is no Qadhaa for Sunnat and Nafl Salaats. Tawbah will be sufficient.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
