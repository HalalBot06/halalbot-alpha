  "question": "What is a Masjid in light of the of Holy Qur’an and Hadith and What are the (necessary) conditions to be a Masjid?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n* What is a Masjid in light of the of Holy Qur’an and Hadith and What are the (necessary) conditions to be a Masjid?\n\n* Are there any difference of opinion among the Islamic Scholars regarding the definition of a Masjid ? According to Hanfi school of Jurisprudence, a Masjid must be Waqf (pious endowment) to the community and once a land is declared as a Masjid it must not be moved, sold or change to other purpose. Do all Islamic scholars agree with this interpretation?\n\n* A leased (rented) property in a non-Muslim land, has been used for past 10 years as a prayer facility (Musallah) and it offers five time daily salaat with jamat ,Friday and Trawee prayer and a madrassa for children\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. A plot of land or building either donated by the owner or purchased by the community for the specific use of a Musjid when Salaat starts to take place therein.\n\n2. Once a building or land is declared a Musjid, it falls under the category of Waqf and may not be moved, sold or treated otherwise.\n\n3. The leased property in the proposed question is not declared a Musjid. It will be referred to merely as a Musalla. The Salaat performed in a Musjid far exceeds the Salaat of a Musalla as far as the rewards and merits are concerned. However, it is not incumbent on the community to go to the Musjid situated 10 kms away as it would be impractical to go there so frequently.\n\n \n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\n \n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
