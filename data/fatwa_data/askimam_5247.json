  "question": "How can a husband whose wife has died (and he's become her non-mehram), pray for his wife for 'isal-e-sawab'?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn regard to your answer to Que.4938,someone asked me that there is a hadith that says that 'a husband/wife is a sadqa-e-jaariyaa for his/her deceased spouse'. So, how is it possible when a wife has died and her husband has become her non-mehram, that it is allowed for him to pray for and give 'isaal-e-sawab' to a non-mehram woman? And why is he allowed to look at her face (of her dead-body) when she's a non-mehram? A non-mehram male is not allowed to see a female's face, so why is it allowed in this case?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for a person to offer Isaal-e-Sawaab to anybody as he\ndesires. Being a Mahram is not a precondition for offering\nSadaqah-e-Jaariya.\n\nThe Fuqahaa have ruled that it will not be permissible for the husband to\ntouch his deceased wife, however, he may look at her. (Shaami vol.2 pg.198)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
