  "question": "Two questions about the current war situations",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear respected brother, 1) At my school and work people ask me that Islam is against these terrorist attacks but why does it say in the Quran to kill any Christian and jew that you see. What is the best answer to give them? 2)Is the recent attack on Afghanistan considered to be an attack on Islam (considered by Muslim scholars)? Is the Taliban's call for Jihad reasonable according to Islam?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The Qur'aan does not instruct to kill any Christian or Jew. That is a\nmisinformation. Consider the following; a) Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) emphasised fulfilling the rights of Dhimmi (non-Muslim citizen in\nan Islamic state), Kindly refer attached\n2. The attack on Afghanistan or any Islamic state by non-Muslims will be\nconsidered as an attack on Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
