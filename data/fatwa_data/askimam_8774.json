  "answer": "QUESTION\nIt is very sad that in today's world our Aalims are discouraged and abused by our own so called brother in Islam. They have everything against the Imaams and whoever preaches them. Can you please tell me if there is any Hadith or ayat from Quran that defines these people, and what will be done to these people?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ: What is the ruling of a person who humiliates an Aalim of Shariáh?\nA: If the person humiliates an Aalim because of his views based upon his knowledge of the Qurãn and Hadith, such a person loses his Imaan. If he is a married person his Nikaah terminates. If he fathers a child before renewing his Imaan and reperforming his Nikah, the child will be illegitimate. (Fatawa Mahmodiya vol.6 pg. 119)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
