  "question": "is it haram to read romantic books is it haram to talk to guys online",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Haraam (strictly prohibited) to read romantic books. It is clear that such literature pollutes the mind, enhances one?s passion and animate instincts.\n\nA human being is stealthy and tends to act on whatever is in his/her heart and mind. The contents of such literature may lead one to think illicit and practice illicit actions. Such literature is thus death to spirituality. The same ruling applies to the chatting of the opposite gender online.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
