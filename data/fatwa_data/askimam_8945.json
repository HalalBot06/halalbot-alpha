  "answer": "QUESTION\nThere is no other way to finance my studies. I want to help the community by becoming a lawyer or doctor. My family is not blessed with a lot of wealth. Is it permissible to obtain these loans? Jazakallahu Khair for all of your help. May Allah Bless You All and All of Your Efforts.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible to take an interest bearing loan merely to advance one?s academic studies. If you do not have the means to advance your studies, do something which is within your reach.\n\nShari?ah did not make you obliged to follow the trend of the times and do something beyond your means. There are many other ways one can contribute to his community.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
