  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am a 47yr old Australian christian woman & have a 24yr old Pakistani Muslim male that is in love with me & wants to marry me.We have been seeing each other for nearly a year.I think he is a lovely gentleman,very well mannered & kind but too young.He says age is not important & his family would love me. We have talked about me converting to Islam but I am not sure.He said he will not force me to convert as better to marry christian than force me to change just for him.\n\nI don't know what to do-please help.\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nOur advice is that you study Islam in depth with an open and unbiased mind with the intention of embracing it once you see its truthfulness. Thereafter, if Allah, the Almighty, opens the door of mercy for you and casts guidance in your heart, nothing can stop you from embracing Islam with all your spirit. Once that happens, ask Allah, the Merciful, to guide you in regards to marrying or not marrying this man. But keep in your mind that Islam does not permit a Muslim man to marry a woman who is a Christian by name and an atheist in beliefs. Also, take into consideration the fact that in Australia it is not uncommon for a non-resident of Australia to fraudulently express his desire to marry an uncritical, naïve Australian resident/citizen with the ulterior motive of acquiring Australian residency.[i] You may also want to consider the fact that according to Islam the Muslim husband has a right to prohibit his Christian wife from going to the Church and from consuming alcohol at his house.[ii] Also, it is not permissible for a Muslim to agree to his children being non-Muslims[iii] -- this is also something you may want to think about.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMl.
