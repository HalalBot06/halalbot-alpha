  "question": "An article named 'Hajj: Tips and Reflections' which I read from the site: IslamiCity (http://www.islamicity.com/)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn this, the author relates from his own experience in the year 2001 that during your time in Makkah: ?6) Most tours when departing Mt Arafat, travel directly to Mena to throw Al-Jamrah Alkubrah, others stop briefly at Al-Musdalifah then continue to Mena while others spend the night or part of it at Al-Musdalifah and then continue to Mena. If at all possible, after leaving Mt Arafat, spend the night at Al Muzdalifah, pray Fajr, then go directly to the Kaba and 1-perform Tawaf Al Ifadah. 2-shave/cut your hair, 3-pay for the slaughter, if applicable, 4-change your Ihram clothes and wait for the evening, 5- to throw Al Jamrah Al Kubrah. This is a good way to avoid the crowd. What I wanted to know was that is it right to take off your Ihram and then do Rammi and 'qurbani' (and also 'Tawaf Al Wada' afterwards) ; as mentioned in this article. Please give some reference from Hadith. Jazakallah Khairun.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA person can remove his Ihraam on the tenth of Dhul-Hijjah after carrying\nout the following acts, a) Making raml of Jamaratul Aqabah, b) After shaving\nthe head, c) After Nahr (slaughtering). Only after these acts are complete\nmay a person remove his Ihraam. (Hidaaya vol.1 pg.250; Shirkatul Ilm)\n\nIt is reported by Imaam Muslim (RA) in his Saheeh, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) on the tenth made Rami, thereafter Halq, thereafter Nahr then he\nbecame Halaal (i.e. removing of Ihraam). (Mishkaat pg.225; Qadeemi)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nfor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
