  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMufti Sahib, does the following Hadith refers to Tableeghi Jamaat?\n\nHoly Prophet (Sallal Laahu Alaihi Wasallam). He states the Prophet(Sallal Laahu Alaihi Wasallam) said \"Nearing Qiyamah there will be a Group of people who will recite the Holy Quran but it will not go below their throats. They will leave the true Religion of Islam as fast as an arrow leaves the bow. They will be recognized by the shavings of their entire head and they will move in Groups and their last Group will emerge with Dajjal, when you meet them you will discover their nature and character, the worst of its kind.\" (Mishkat pp/309)....\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe hadīth in question does not refer to the Tablīgh Jamā’at.\n\nThe entire hadīth is reproduced hereunder:\n\nعن شريك بن شهاب قال كنت أتمنى أن ألقى رجلا من أصحاب النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم أسأله عن الخوارج فلقيت أبا برزة في يوم عيد في نفر من أصحابه فقلت له : هل سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم يذكر الخوارج فقال نعم سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم بأذني ورأيته بعيني أتي رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم بمال فقسمه فأعطى من عن يمينه ومن عن شماله ولم يعط من وراءه شيئا فقام رجل من ورائه فقال يا محمد ما عدلت في القسمة رجل أسود مطموم الشعر عليه ثوبان أبيضان فغضب رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم غضبا شديدا وقال والله لا تجدون بعدي رجلا هو أعدل مني ثم قال يخرج في آخر الزمان قوم كأن هذا منهم يقرؤون القرآن لا يجاوز تراقيهم يمرقون من الإسلام كما يمرق السهم من الرمية سيماهم التحليق لا يزالون يخرجون حتى يخرج آخرهم مع المسيح الدجال فإذا لقيتموهم فاقتلوهم هم أشر الخلق والخليقة\n\nShurayk bin Shihāb narrates that he said, I desired to meet a companion of the Prophet (SAW) so I may ask them regarding the Kawārij. I then met Baraza on the day of ‘Eid in a gathering of his followers. I asked him, have you heard the Prophet of Allāh (SAW) discussing the Kawārij? He replied, yes. I have heard the Prophet of Allāh with my two years and seen him with my two eyes. Once the prophet came with wealth and started to distribute it. He gave the people on his right and the people on his left and did not give any to those behind him. A person from behind him stood and said, O Muhammad, you have not done justice to a black man with disheveled hair, donning two white sheets. The Prophet of Allāh become extremely angry and said, “By the oath of Allāh, you will not find a person more just than me. After that he said, “At the end of time, a nation will emerge; it is as if this man is from them. They will recite the Qur’ān but it will not pass beyond their throats. They will leave the religion of Islām how an arrow leaves the bow. Their salient feature will be the shaving of the head. The continue emerging until the last of them emerges with the Dajjāl. If you meet them, you will discover they are the worst in character and the worst creation.” (Al-Nasa’ī)\n\nThe Sahābī himself clearly mentions that this hadīth is regarding the deviated group, the Kawārij. A detailed discussion of the Kawārij can be found the books of Aqa’īd.\n\nThe Tablīgh Jamā’at is not referred to by this hadīth. The Tablīgh Jamā’at is an effort carried out throughout the world. Its aims are to bring dīn into the lives of the Muslims. This effort is a very noble effort which has caused thousands, if not millions, to change their lives in accordance to the teachings of Qur’an as explained by the Prophet of Allāh (SAW). Many individuals who were completely oblivious of the commandments of Allāh now constantly have the worry and concern of how they can practice upon Islam to the minutest detail and how others also can practice upon the beautiful religion of Islām.  The Tablīgh Jamā’at teaches its followers adopt the six qualities. The six qualities i.e., firm belief in the kalima, performance of salāt, practicing dhikr and acquiring knowledge, sincerity in one’s intentions, kindness towards other Muslims, and to strive in the path of Allāh, all have been derived from the Qur’ān and hadīth. May Allāh accept the efforts of those involved in Tablīgh Jamā’at and give us the opportunity to assist them in their noble cause, Āmīn.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
