  "question": "Making fard prayer before fard in Jamaâ€™t with imam due to wind problem",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSometimes I have wind problem when wind passes every five to ten minutes. With Imam in Masjid when he prays long rakats, sometimes I have to leave the prayer in between and go to make wudu again and again. I wanted to know if I can pray fard with short rakats at home (also it is easy to make repeated wudus at home) and then go to masjid and pray fard with Imam again so that either of two will be accepted.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two aspects to your question:-\n\nThe first is the repetition of the fard Salaah which there is no need for because of the whudu breaking. The solution is that you go and make your salaah with jamaah as you would and if your whudu breaks you would leave and renew the whudu and return and complete the salaah. If your Salaah breaks in the first rakaah and then you go and renew the whudu you would still get the rest of the Salaah and Allah willing get the full reward as the problem is a natural one and could happen to anyone even the Imaam .\n\nThe second part is that you need to seek medical advice on how to over come the problem which nowadays there are many solutions to such a problem.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nShaykh Irshaad Amod\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & Approved: Mufti Imraan Vawda (FATWA DEPT.)"
