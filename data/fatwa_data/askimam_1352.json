  "question": "What is the detail Shar'i ruling with regards to an illegitimate child. Does the father have any rights. Is maintenance compulsory on the father.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe father is offering maintenance for his illegitimate child. Hence he desires to see the child regularly. The mother of the child refuses to allow him to see the child.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, an illegitimate child is attributed to the mother only.\nGranting the biological father rights and responsibility of maintenance will\nbe showing complacency to the illicit and Haraam act of Zina.\n\nHowever, the mother may accept the maintenance given by the father and she\nmay also allow him visitation to his biological child.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
