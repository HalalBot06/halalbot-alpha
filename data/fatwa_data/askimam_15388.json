  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI just need to know what should a person do(that does not have authority due to age to say anything) if a very close family member owns a music shop and what are the implications for the people that live in that house and other people that eat and stay very often there?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n \n\nThe person should consult with the local aalim and seek advice from him. The local aalim will know the family members and their temperament and advise accordingly.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
