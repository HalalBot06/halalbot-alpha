  "question": "My grandpa is blaming me for something I did (not on purpose). I realized my mistake and now he is using false statements to belittle me. Please advice me so that I can alleviate the feeling of anger.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is encouraging to note that you acknowledge the wrong you did. You could speak lies and wrong defend yourself. You spoke the truth and abstained from the sin of lies.\n\nIt is natural for you to be angry when belittled. Our advise to you is to be patient. Do that for the pleasure of Allah. You will feel contentment of heart. You should also think that life is a learning experience. If this did not happen to you, you would not know pain and how to be patient. This exercise will be very useful to you in life. Remember, life is filled with much trials and only the patient ones can successfully persevere.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
