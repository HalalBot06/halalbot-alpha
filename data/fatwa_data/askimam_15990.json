  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI want to know about interest . I know interest is haram but if any one takes loan on interest and build a home and then suddenly too many  problems catches him and he get sick . Is this possible that this is due to the interest ? because I believe that most of the difficulties are the results of our own amal. I cannot try to make them realize unless I am sure that what i am saying is right and these all problems are the result of  this interest . If I am wrong plz make me correct. how should I tell them . those people are more religious than me .should I keep quiete and let them do ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAllah has created us and given us a manual of life which is complete and comprehensive. It addresses every issue of our lives and issues us guidance from birth until death. If we follow the Quraan e Kareem throughout our life we will be successful in this life and the hereafter.\n\nInterest is expressly prohibited in the Quraan (2/275). Those who involve themselves in interest are in war with Allah (2/279). Who will succeed the war against Allah? Furthermore, Allah states that the wealth of those involved in interest decreases (2/276).\n\nIt is therefore no surprise for to read of the difficulties the person involved in interest are experiencing. They have earned their destruction with their own hands. They will have to bear the burden on their wrongs. We are aware of many wealthy individuals who after becoming involved in the sin of interest became paupers.\n\nIn order to remedy their situation they should make sincere Tawbah to Allah and make an intention never to repeat the sin. Together with seeking Allah’s forgiveness they should make an effort to settle the loan as soon as possible.\n\nSince you will be advising them we suggest that you adopt a diplomatic approach to them. Although they have erred in their actions, they are human and none are error proof. You should try and assist them to come out of this difficulty rather than making them despondent and discouraged. Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said “Whoever removes a difficulty from a Mu’min (believer), Allah will relieve him of his difficulty on the day of Qiyaamah”. If you handle the matter with this spirit and goal, surely you will be successful.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
