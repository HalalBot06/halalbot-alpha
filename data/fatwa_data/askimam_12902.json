  "question": "is fasting on 15th Shaban bidah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\njazak allahr khier\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRecommended Deeds %0D%0AThe following practices are derived from the traditions of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam which have been mentioned above for Sha?baan and its virtuous 15th night. %0D%0AIt is desirable that one fasts in the month of Sha?baan as much as one can. However, if fasting in Sha?baan is going to affect the fasting of Ramadhaan then one should refrain from it. %0D%0A%0D%0AAlthough the fast of 15th of Sha?baan can only be derived from the ahaadeeth which have a weak chain of narration, nevertheless the fast would be desirable considering other factors such as: %0D%0Aa) The fasts of the first half of Sha?baan have special merits as can be seen from the practice of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam %0D%0Ab) The virtues of the fasts of Ayyaamul Beedh (i.e. 13th, 14th and 15th of the Islamic month) have been mentioned in the ahaadeeth %0D%0Ac) A large number of the elders (salaf) of the Ummah have been observing the fast of the 15th of Sha?baan. %0D%0A%0D%0AAlthough everyday salaah should be performed in Jamaa?ah (congregation), on this auspicious night, one must participate with deep and solemn care in the Maghrib, ?Ishaa and Fajr Salaah. %0D%0A%0D%0ASpend as much time of the night as possible in worship individually. No specific du?aa or method of worship has been prescribed. One may engage in dhikr, recitation of the Qur?aan, salaah, learning and teaching or any other form of ?ibaadah. However, one must refrain from worldly talk and wasting of time. If ?ibaadah is not possible then at least avoid all sinful and useless acts and go to bed as soon as possible. %0D%0A%0D%0AIn one hadeeth it has been mentioned that Rasoolullah sallallahu alayhi wasallam visited the graveyard of Baqee?. However, one may not establish the practice to be Sunnah as there is no mention of Rasoolullah sallallahu alayhi wasallam making it a general practice of this night. Hence, if one visits the graveyard once in a while it will be permissible. %0D%0A%0D%0AOne must refrain in particular from all those practices which are contrary to the Sunnah. Many of us deprive ourselves of the blessings of such auspicious moments and the Favours of Allah ta'aalaa by following those customary acts which have no basis in the Qur?aan and Sunnah. %0D%0AMay Allah ta'aalaa guide us all on the straight path and enlighten us with the blessings of this sacred month and its blessed night. Aameen. %0D%0A%0D%0A%A9 Islamic Da'wah Academy%0D%0A"
