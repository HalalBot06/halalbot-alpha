  "question": "should the following be treated as two divorces or three divorces?Or should I rely on the Istikhara result that the divorce has been revoked or not?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease help me in this I am very confused. Last weekend my husband divorced me in a fit of anger amid arguments. He says he was not pre-planned but it just got spelled out due to anger. The problem is we are not sure how many times he pronounced it. What I remember is, he said: ?I am divorcing you, I have divorced you, I have divorced you.? My question is that the above words should be treated as two divorces or three divorces? Though later that night he apologized and expressed that the words spoken were in anger and he hasn?t divorced me. Until this time we were under the impression that divorce in one sitting is always counted as one no matter pronounced as many times. But later on I came to know that these will be counted as many times as they are pronounced. For this reason I recited the Istikhara dua before going to bed so that Allah may guide as to what course should be taken. And I got the dream somewhat related to divorce. Now what should I do. Should I rely on the Istikhara or how do I convince myself that the divorce has been revoked or not?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe statements, ?I am divorcing you?, ?I have divorced you?, ?I have divorced you?, constitutes three divorces ? Talaaq-e-Mughalladha (permanently irrevocable divorce). You are no more husband and wife. Three divorces in one sitting is three and not one.\n\nA woman is not an object to be treated any how. She must be given respect and honour. Husbands should exercise restraint and avoid threatening their wives with divorces. That is a sign of their weakness.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
