  "question": "Would you please answer the followingquestions?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs-Salaam-O-Alaykum. Would you please explain the following: If 'BIDDAAT' leads to destruction, as explaind by Rasoolallah (Sallalahoo Alahey Sallaam), then how can there be a 'BIDDAT-E-HASSAANAH'and 'BIDDAT-E-SAAYEEAAH'? My reason for asking this question is, that the Imaam of our masjid, recites few aayaat's of Quraan loudly (using microphone) after each faraad salat, and explains this practice as a 'BIDDAT-E-HASSAANAH'.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo recite the Qur'aan is indeed an act of virtue.\n\nHowever, the consistent practice of the Imaam reciting few verses of the Qur\n'aan loudly after each Fardh Salaat may lead to a misconception that the\npractice is necessary. Any permissible act purported to be necessary in any\nway will be misrepresentation of Shari'ah that may eventually lead to\ndistortion of Deen. Therefore, such an act will be Bid'at.\n\nShari'ah does not facilitate any type of Bid'at, Hasana or otherwise if\nthere is a fear that such Bid'at will lead to misconception of the actual\nShari'ah and Sunnah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
