  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh,\n\nI would like to say Jazak Allah Khair for all your efforts, May Allah the most merciful grant us all Jannah, Ameen,\n\nMy mum, little sister and my mum’s friend are going on holiday, I know Islamiclly, my mum shouldn’t travel without a mahram. My father does not want to go, and is left it up to me whether I go on not, the only concern is that my mums friend is a young female around my age (20) who is not Muslim. I don’t know how this will work out due to we will be travelling together; staying together but it separate rooms, go to different places together.\n\nShaitaan is very strong and I fear I can be tricked into doing something haram, but then that also opens the door of my mum and little sister travelling without a mahram, my mother does not observe hijab (may Allah guide her) and my sister is very young and I fear for them. My mum’s parents will be at the country they are visiting so my father says it will be ok.\n\nI would like to know whether I should go or not, they have already paid for their tickets and time is running out to get mine, but I wanted to get your advice first, Jazak Allah for the support you give to fellow Muslims and non-Muslims I await for your answer Insha’Allah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nYou are aware that it is not permissible for a female to travel without a mahram. This is expressly prohibited in the Hadith.\n\nحدثنا أبو كامل الجحدري حدثنا بشر يعني بن مفضل حدثنا سهيل بن أبي صالح عن أبيه عن أبي هريرة قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم * لا يحل لامرأة أن تسافر ثلاثا إلا ومعها ذو محرم منها صحيح مسلم - عبد الباقي - (2 / 977(\n\n \n\nYou should not travel with your mum if you are not accompanied by your father or any other mahram.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best,\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
