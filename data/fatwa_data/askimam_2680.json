  "question": "Why Shia abuse the Sahaba-e-karam? Following are some beleifs in detail which Shia belive about sahab-e-karam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThey always abuses sahab-e-karam except Hazrat Ali (radiallahu anhu). They said that hazrat Abu Bakr (radiallahu anhu) cried in Gaar-e-Hira when both Our Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and Abu Bakr (radiallahu anhu) were hidden there,because they want to arrest Our Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) (NaoozBillah).And such beiefs are also with hazrat Umar (radiallahu anhu) and Hazrat Usman (radiallahu anh). Please tell me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nEXTRACT FROM SHAYKH HUZAIFI'S KHUTBAH%0D%0A%0D%0AHow can there be any similarity, any bond between Islam and Yahudiyyat (the%0D%0AJewish faith), when Islam is exceptional, with its purity, light,%0D%0Abrilliance, nobility, justice, toleration, magnanimity, high morality,%0D%0Aequally for man or Jinn, while Yahudiyyat is a collection of materialism and%0D%0Anarrow-mindedness, bears malice towards humanity, is steeped in moral%0D%0Adegradation, greed and covetousness? So how can there be any link between%0D%0AIslam and Yahudiyyat? Can any Muslim tolerate the aspersion cast upon the%0D%0Apious, pure character of Hadhrat Maryam %C1layhas salaam by the Jews? Can the%0D%0AMuslims bear the presence of the Jews who call Hadhrat `Esa %C1layhis salaam%0D%0A(Christ) the son of a whore? Na`oozubilLah. Allah forbid! And on this%0D%0Aaccount how can there be any link between the Holy Qur'an and Talmud, the%0D%0Aholy book of the Satanish Jews?%0D%0A%0D%0ASimilarly there is no similarity between Christianity and Islam. Islam is a%0D%0Apure and clean religion believing in the oneness of Allah, in Tauheed. It is%0D%0Apure justice and a blessing. It is complete Sharee`ah, the revealed law,%0D%0Awhereas Christianity is a deviation from the right path. The misled%0D%0AChristians hold the belief of Trinity-Father, Son, Holy Ghost. Christianity%0D%0Aclaims that Christ is God and the son of God.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd how can there be a reconciliation between the Ahlus Sunnah and shiah?%0D%0AThe Ahlus Sunnah are those who learnt and protected the Qur'aan al Kareem,%0D%0Awho preserved and protected the Sunnah of Rasulullah ((Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam)), those whom Allah Ta'ala has used to protect His Deen, and they%0D%0Amade Jihaad in the way of Islam. And history bears ample testimony to this.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Raafidhah (shiahs) are those who curse the Sahaabah and attempt to%0D%0Adestroy Islam. The Sahaabah Radhiyallaahu %C1nhum are those that transmitted%0D%0Athe Deen to us. If we had to cast aspersions at the integrity of the%0D%0ASahaabah, it will imply the destruction of the Deen. How can there be a%0D%0Areconciliation between the Ahlus Sunnah and the Raafidhah (shiahs) while%0D%0Athey swear and abuse the three Khulafaa ur Raashidah? If they had any%0D%0Aintelligence then they would realise that their abuse is in fact an abuse of%0D%0ARasululllah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam). Hadhrat Abu Bakr and Umar%0D%0ARadhiyallaahu %C1nhuma are the fathers-in-law of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam). They were his close confidants during his lifetime, and%0D%0Ahis close neighbours after his demise. Who can achieve this honour? Who can%0D%0Aachieve this honour? They took part in Jihaad with Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam) in all the Jihaad campaigns. These facts should be%0D%0Asufficient to dispel the false accusations of the shiahs.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Uthmaan Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu was husband to two of the daughters of%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam). Allah Ta'ala will not choose for%0D%0Ahis beloved Rasool except the best of men, and the best of companions. This%0D%0Awas the relationship between Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) and%0D%0Athe three Khulafaa ur Raashideen. He never said that these three are the%0D%0Aenemies of Islam, and never warned against these three, as the shiahs claim.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf fact swearing at these three is an attack against Hadhrat Ali%0D%0ARadhiyallaahu %C1nhu. Hadhrat Ali Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu gave Hadhrat Abu Bakr%0D%0ARadhiyallaahu %C1nhu the Bay'%E1t (oath of allegiance) in the Musjid (openly);%0D%0Aand he (Hadhrat Ali Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) got his daughter Ummu Kulthoom%0D%0Amarried to Hadhrat Umar Radhiyallahu unhu; he took the Bay'%E1t at the hands%0D%0Aof Hadhrat Uthmaan Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu, was his minister, close friend and%0D%0Abeloved one.%0D%0AWould Hadhrat Ali Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu give his daughter to a kaafir, or would%0D%0Ahe give the bay'%E1 to a kaafir? Subhaanallah, this is indeed a great slander.%0D%0A%0D%0ATheir curse of Hadhrat Mu'aawiyah (Radhiyallah Anhu) is in fact an attack%0D%0Aagainst Hadhrat Hassan Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu, who accepted the khilaafat of%0D%0AHadhrat Mu'aawiyah Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu, and whom many prominent Sahaabah%0D%0Aaccepted. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) praised him on many%0D%0Aoccasions. Would the grandson of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)%0D%0Aaccept the khilaafat of a kaafir? Subhaanallah, this is indeed a great%0D%0Aslander.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen they say that Hadhrat Ali and Hassan Radhiyallaahu %C1nhuma were forced%0D%0Ato do so, it displays their (shiahs') lack of intelligence. This is an%0D%0Ainsult to the two of them, a most vile insult.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd how is it that they curse Ummul Mu'mineen Hadhrat 'Aaisha %7BRadhiyallahu%0D%0Aanha%7D, whereas Allah Ta'ala declares in the Qur'aan that she is Ummul%0D%0AMu'mineen (Mother of the Believers).%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala says:%0D%0AThe Prophet has a greater right over the Mu'mineen than they have over%0D%0Athemselves, and his Wives are their (the Mu'muneen's) Mothers.%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore there is no doubt that those who curse her, she is not a mother%0D%0Aunto them (they are not Mu'mineen). Would any person curse his own mother?%0D%0ARather he would love her dearly.%0D%0A%0D%0AHow can there ever be a reconciliation between the Ahlus Sunnah and the%0D%0ARaafidhah (shiahs), when they believe Khomeini, the imaam of deviation, to%0D%0Abe sinless. They assert that he is the deputy of their concocted Mahdi.%0D%0ASince they regard their imaams to be sinless, and since in the absence of%0D%0Athe principle the deputy has the same status, they assert Khomeini to be%0D%0Asinless.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd one form of Baatil only assists another. And one form of Baatil only%0D%0Aassists another.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd the Ahle Bayt are free and absolved from their (shiah's) beliefs. The%0D%0Aproofs substantiating the falsehood of the beliefs of the shiahs are%0D%0Ainnumerable.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs far as we, the Ahlus Sunnah, are concerned, we will not draw closer to%0D%0Athem a hair's breath, or even less. They are a greater harm to Islam than%0D%0Aeven the Yahood and Nasaarah. It is incumbent on all Muslims to be wary of%0D%0Athem and be on guard against them.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala says:%0D%0AThey are your enemies, so beware of them. Allah Ta'ala declares war against%0D%0Athem. Where will they find refuge?%0D%0A%0D%0AThe shiahs are the followers of Ibn Saba, the yahoodi, and of Abu Lu'lu-ah,%0D%0Athe majoosi (fire-worshiper). Thus, O Muslims, it is necessary for us to%0D%0Adistinguish our Aqeedah, and to love those whom Allah Ta'ala loves, and hate%0D%0Athat which Allah Ta'ala hates, to bring about unity amongst the Muslims, to%0D%0Abe one strong united hand. The enemies of Islam have united in their false%0D%0Abeliefs, to fight against Islam. This applies whether the enemies are of old%0D%0Aor new.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta%E3la says:%0D%0A\"Never will the Jews and Christians be satisfied with thee unless thou%0D%0Afollow their form of religion.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd He says:%0D%0A\"And they will go on fighting you until they turn you away from your faith%0D%0Aif they could.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AHow can there be any similarity, any bond between Islam and Yahudiyyat, (the%0D%0AJewish faith) when Islam is exceptional, with its purity, light, brilliance,%0D%0Anobility, justice, toleration, magnanimity, high morality, equally for man%0D%0Aor Jinn, and Yahudiyyat is, a collection of materialism and%0D%0Anarrow-mindedness, bears malice towards humanity, is steeped in moral%0D%0Adegradation, greed and covetousness.%0D%0A%0D%0A--------------%0D%0AIntegrity of the Prophet's Companions%0D%0A%0D%0ABy By Muhammad Alkhider%0D%0A%0D%0ASome people intentionally or unintentionally do refer to the meaning of%0D%0AIntegrity and the concept of Infallibility as synonymous, although the%0D%0Adifference between them is crystal-clear. As such, they think that%0D%0Aattributing virtuousness to the companions of the Holy Prophet necessitates%0D%0Atheir infallibility. What a grave mistake!%0D%0A%0D%0AIntegrity of the Prophet's companions means that: they were neither%0D%0Ahypocrites, liars, lewd, immoral nor infidels. Besides, they were righteous%0D%0Abelievers who would err sometimes and correct their mistakes thereafter.%0D%0AThey committed mistakes after which they hastened to repent and seek%0D%0Aforgiveness from Allah Almighty. They obeyed God, the Most High, and%0D%0Aexpected His acceptance of their acts of devotion without an iota of doubt.%0D%0A%0D%0AInfallibility requires of a person to be exalted from committing sins or%0D%0Aperpetuating shortcomings. Both his mind and body should be immaculate of%0D%0Ablemishes and shortcomings that can easily defame his rank and traduce his%0D%0Astatus.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe difference between Integrity and Infallibility is crystal-clear in%0D%0AIslam. The Sunni Muslims do refer to the companions of the Holy Prophet as%0D%0Astraightforward, virtuous and honest but not infallible. Impeccability%0D%0Aaccording to the belief of the Sunni Muslims is only attributed to Prophets%0D%0Aand Messenger of God Almighty.%0D%0A%0D%0ARegarding the source of integrity and the question whether it is a%0D%0APhilosophical theory or rather an Islamic fact that a host of texts has%0D%0Aproved authentic, the answer is as follows:%0D%0A%0D%0AA pondering and reflecting look at the Holy Qur'an and a study that Muslims%0D%0Arender to the Book of God and the authentic traditions of the Holy Prophet%0D%0A(PBUH) is able to provide a convincing answer to the aforementioned%0D%0Aquestion. Allah, the Holy One, says in the Holy Qur'an: \"Allah's good%0D%0Apleasure was on the believers when they swore Fealty to thee under the Tree:%0D%0AHe knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down Tranquility to them: and%0D%0AHe rewarded them with a speedy victory.\" (48: 18)%0D%0A%0D%0AGod Almighty in the above-mentioned verse explained to His messenger and the%0D%0Aentire believing folk that His pleasure was on the believers, men and women,%0D%0Awho plighted fealty to Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him). He informed his%0D%0Amessenger furthermore that He knew what was concealed in their hearts%0D%0Aregarding faith in Him and truthfulness. Hence, He sent down tranquility,%0D%0Apeace, calm and sense of security and confidence to them. This suffices as%0D%0Atestimony from God Almighty regarding the veracity of the companions' faith,%0D%0Atheir truthfulness and sincerity. It has been proven that the messenger of%0D%0AGod (PBUH) said: \"No one among those who swore their fealty to me under the%0D%0Atree will be consigned to Hell except the owner of the red camel.\" (Related%0D%0Aby At-Tirmidhiy in \"Al-Mana'qib [Virtues of the Companions], and Muslim in%0D%0Athe same titled book)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe man who was doomed to Hell-fire according to the above-mentioned Hadith,%0D%0Awas among the arch-hypocrites of Madinah called Al-Jaddu bin Qais.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe number of the companions who swore their fealty to the Prophet (PBUH)%0D%0Awas 1,400. According to other traditions it reached 1,500. God Almighty%0D%0Atestified to their sincere and truthfulness and confirmed to His messenger%0D%0Athat there was no grain of hypocrisy in their hearts except one man. The%0D%0Amessenger of God (PBUH) eventually revealed his name to the companions. His%0D%0Aname was Al-Jaddu bin Qais. He did not swear his fealty to the messenger of%0D%0AGod as did the companions under the Tree of Allah's Pleasure. Allah, Exalted%0D%0Ain Might, says in the Holy Qur'an: \"Not equal among you are those who spent%0D%0A(freely) and fought before the victory (with those who did so later). Those%0D%0Aare higher in rank than those who spent (freely) and fought afterwards. But%0D%0Ato all has Allah promised a goodly (reward.) (57: 10)%0D%0A%0D%0AGod, the Most High, in the above-mentioned verse, promised the companions%0D%0Awho spent freely before and after the speedy victory of the liberation of%0D%0AMakkah, a goodly reward. Moreover, He passed a verdict regarding the ones He%0D%0Apromised a goodly reward, that they would be safe from the torment of the%0D%0AHell-fire on the Resurrection Day. He says in the Holy Qur'an: \"Those for%0D%0Awhom the good (record) from Us has gone before, will be removed far%0D%0Atherefrom. Not the slightest sound will they hear of hell. What their souls%0D%0Adesired, in that will they dwell. The Great Terror will bring them no%0D%0Agrief.\" (21: 101-103) Allah Almighty also says in the Holy Qur'an: \"Ye are%0D%0Athe best of peoples, evolved for mankind, enjoining what is right,%0D%0Aforbidding what is wrong, and believing in Allah.\" (3: 110)%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, it is incredible for a nation (People) that Allah Almighty has%0D%0Areferred to as the best of people evolved for mankind, as testimony from Him%0D%0Ato be as the Shiite Adherents and Sources maintain! For they say: \"The%0D%0Aemigrants (from Makkah to Madinah) and the Ansa'r (those who welcomed,%0D%0Ahelped and hosted the Prophet and his companions who came from Makkah) all%0D%0Aof them recanted their religion except three.\" (Al-Kaafiy, 2%2F244)%0D%0A%0D%0AHad it been true that they were really as described by the Shiite Sources,%0D%0AAllah Almighty would have not praised and placed them in a lofty rank in the%0D%0Aaforementioned verse and in many others. The messenger of God (PBUH) says:%0D%0A\"Prophet Noah (on him be peace) is going to be summoned by God Almighty on%0D%0Athe Resurrection Day. He will say: \"Here I am at your service O my Lord!\"%0D%0AThen God Almighty will ask him: \"Did you convey the message?\" Noah's%0D%0Aresponse will be: \"Yes.\" Then God Almighty will ask Noah's people: \"Did he%0D%0Aconvey the message?\" They will apparently say: \"No Warner came to us.\" Then%0D%0AGod Almighty will ask Noah (Peace be upon him): \"Who will testify that you%0D%0Aconveyed the message?\" Noah will obviously say: \"Muhammad (Peace be upon%0D%0Ahim) and his people (followers).\" Then the followers of Prophet Muhammad%0D%0A(PBUH) will unanimously testify that Noah (on him be peace) delivered the%0D%0Amessage entrusted to him by God Almighty.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AProphet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) informed us of the aforementioned%0D%0Asituation in his interpretation of the following verse: \"Thus have We made%0D%0Ayou an Ummah (nation, people) justly balanced, that ye might be witnesses%0D%0Aover yourselves.\" (2: 143)%0D%0A%0D%0AProphet Muhammad (PBUH) in the context of his interpretation of the%0D%0Aaforementioned verse said: \"To be justly balanced means: to be%0D%0Astraightforward.\" Related by Al-Bukha'riy%0D%0A%0D%0AThus the messenger of God (PBUH) confirmed the non-shaky integrity of his%0D%0Ahonest, truthful and sincere companions.%0D%0A"
