  "question": "1. Is it True That Mullah Omar has our prophet's shawl?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Is it true that Mullah Omar has our prophet's shawl, and that if he were to put on it would make him invisible from the crowd? 2. During the sitting when u are praying Atahiyat and durood and while praying the durood u realize u made a mistake in Atahiyat how should we correct the mistake. 3. My day sometimes says things that may contradict what is said in Islam. Things like Tablig is a separate Firqa, Taliban itself may also be a separate Firqa etc. He questions things like safi maybe correct and sunnis maybe wrong Firqa etc. I then try to tell him that it is incorrect to talk about it and we shouldn't discuss it. Instead at the end we get into argument and he gets mad at me. Should I just quietly listen to what he says or still try to correct him. Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We have no knowledge of this shawl. There is no basis to believe that a person wearing the shawl of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) becomes invisible.\n\n2. You may repeat the Attahiyyaat and Durood. No Sajdah Sahw will be necessary.\n\n3. Generally, parents are of such nature that their own children cannot make headway in making them understand. Do not engage in such discussions. Try your best to get your father to sit in the company of the pious Ulama. In that way there is much hope that he will gain understanding.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
