  "answer": "QUESTION\nI bought these plates which have the Kaaba and Medina Haram on them, they have gold plating on them of 24 karat gold, the gold is just a line on the edge of the plate, am I liable for zakaat on them?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, we should understand that there is a difference between 24 Carat gold and 24 Carat gold plated.\n\nGold plating is not pure gold. Zakaat is liable only in 24 Carat gold, not gold plating.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
