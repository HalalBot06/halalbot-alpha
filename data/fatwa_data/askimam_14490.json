  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIm the only supporter of my family & Im seekng job in any gud educational organization but because of my responsibilities I couldnt afford to continue my studies. Im a student of graduation. Im strugglng hard to get a suitable job but to get job in any reputable institute Im required to b graduate. Now my qestion is that if ImÂ confident about my abilities to meet the level of a graduate student can I apply anywhere as a graduate degree holder? Wat does Islam teach me to do in current circumstances? & if I do so can I make it sure that my salary will be Halaal?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYou do not have a graduate degree. It will, therefore, not be permissible to apply for a job as a graduate. If you are employed and provide a service like a graduate, your income will be Halaal.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
