  "question": "People say Shaykh Nazim and Shaykh Haqqani of the Naqshbandi Tareeqah can perform miracles as they are awliya Allah. Is this true? Is it possible?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssallamu Alaykum Ya Shaykh ! I have more than one question, kindly answer all. 2. Are there awliya Allah in our times that you know of and can name for me? 3. Are you a Wali Allah? 4. Is it necessary to follow a tareeqa like Naqshbandi etc. ? Jazaakum Allah Khair !\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe do not know who Shaykh Nazim and Shaykh Haqqaani. However, as followers\nof the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaa`h, we believe in Karaamats (miracles performed\nby saintly persons).\n\nAllah Ta'ala has created saintly persons in every time and era. Allah Ta'ala\ngifts some saintly persons with Karaamats. However, performing miracles is\nnot a condition to be a saintly person. There are four famous schools in\nSufism - Chistiyya, Naqshabandi, Saharwardiyya, Qaadriyya. Each school has\nprescribed its own way of reformation. However, the ultimate purpose is Ma'\nrifat (recognition) of Allah Ta'ala and Ittiba-e-Sunnah (following the\nSunnah).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
