  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs alcohlole based perfumes permitted in shafee madhhab\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n Assalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAccording to the Shafi’i madhhab, khamr (alcoholic beverage made of grape juice) and nabīz (alcoholic beverages that are made from other type of juices beside grape) are haram and impure (al-Tuhfah, al-Nihayah). Therefore, ethanol derived from alcoholic beverages is also haram and impure.\n\nThe synthetic alcohol is produced through the hydration of ethylene or hydroxylation of ethyl sulphate to yield ethanol and regenerate the sulphuric acid. Here, there is no fermentation process, thus, the synthetic alcohol is pure.\n\nTherefore, synthetic alcohol would be permissible to use and will not cause body or clothing become impure. However it is not permissible for oral intake.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
