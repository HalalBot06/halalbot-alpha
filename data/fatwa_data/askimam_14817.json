  "question": "it is not clear why do you think that the remaining amount of Hajj is not a Liability at the moment",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) In reference to Fatwa#14589, it is not clear why do you think that the remaining amount of Hajj is not a Liability at the moment? I have paid about 27% of the total Hajj amount one month before the 1st of Ramadhan (the Zakat calculation date). The remaining balance should be paid within few weeks. Isn’t it that the Liability starts at the time of signing the contract? Or does it starts at the time of actual payment? Please define the term Liability. Jazakallahu Khaira for your guidance.\n\n 2)       I come to know from a Mufti Saheb in Pakistan that a Namaz is valid when prayed either on earth or anything intact with earth. As the aeroplane while flying does not fulfill this condition, the Namaz prayed on it whether in standing or sitting position must be repeated later on the ground. But in different answers to similar question on your website, I found that the Namaz prayed in standing position in aeroplane need not be repeated. Does any such condition exist that Namaz is valid on earth only?\n\n 3) I heard great rewards for making Wudho at home and going to Masjid. But the problem in most western countries is that on the way to Masjid there is a great chance of a look on either almost naked picture or some actual person in the same way. This problem occurs more in summer time. Would the Wudho be still valid if a look goes onto such a picture or a person? Would you recommend to make Wudho in Masjid instead of home anyway?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1.  If you have signed a contract for Hajj, and only paid the deposit, the remaining balance is a liability upon you, hence Zakaat is not necessary on the outstanding amount.\n2.  There are differences among our Ulama regarding this query. Some Ulama like Mufti Rashid Ahmad Ludhyanwi (Rahimahullah) is of the opinion that the Salaah in an aeroplane must be repeated although the Salaah was performed standing (Ahsanul Fataawa Vol.4 Pg 89). Some Ulama are of the opinion that if the Salaah was performed standing in the aeroplane, it is not necessary to repeat the Salaah. As a matter of precaution, it is better to repeat the Salaah even if it was performed in the standing posture. If one does not do so, that too will suffice.\n3.  Looking at a strange woman does not nullify the Wudhu. However, if by looking at her, Mazi (colourless liquid that comes out of the private part when aroused) emitted the private part, Wudhu will be invalidated.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
