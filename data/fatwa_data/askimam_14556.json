  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI work/live in a place/campus in US where there are around 4500 non-muslims and me being the only Muslim. Is it ok if i remove my cap and other muslim/ traditional attire before i come into the campus for work/home, because i really dont want to be seen as the only muslim over here or Do i need to act like i am proud to be a muslim when i come across these people and have my traditional dress on or will that make me look like an arrogant muslim/show off. I am new here and i really dont know what to do. Please help\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah has created man and Jinn to worship him. Allah states, ‘I have created man and Jinn solely for my worship.’ In another Aayat, ‘Do you think that you have been created in vain and you will not return to us.’\n\nMost certainly, we have been created to worship Allah and will be resurrected to give an account of our deeds. This life is but a test. Allah has created life and death to test who does the best actions. Allah tests man in different ways at different times. Some will be tested with decease/increase in wealth and prosperity, some with the loss of loved ones and some with fear. As Allah mentioned in the Qur’aan, ‘And certainly we shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits. But give glad tidings to the patient ones.’ (Baqarah 155)\n\nOne will also be confronted with situation where a discussion will have to be made to follow the Sunnah of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] or otherwise and lucky indeed are those who chose to follow the Sunnah for in it lies honour and respect. We are Muslims and have been chosen to be in the best Ummah, i.e. Ummah of the best of creations. Let us be proud for we have been given the best Deen. A religion that has taught us how to conduct our 24 hours complex or make the thoughts or comments of people distract us.\n\nOnce a Taabi’ee was a guest of a king. While eating, some food fell, without any hesitation he followed the Sunnah of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and pick the morsel of food. When his companion saw him doing this, he rebuked him saying this is the court. How can you do such a despicable act. He replied that ‘Shall I leave the practice of my beloved, i.e. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], for the sake of these fools.’\n\nThis was the honour shown to the Sunnah of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. By these great luminiries who practised on the teachings of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] without hesitation or fear of criticism. We should also follow the teachings of Islam at all times whether in the work place travelling or at home. Today, you might feel it difficult to wear the Islamic attire, but you should consider for a moment that today you are the only one, but what about tomorrow when more Muslims come to the campus, won’t they be inspired by your dedication and steadfastness? They, themselves begin to adorn the Islamic attire and as time passes Muslims will feel comfortable to wear the Islamic attire at campus and you will be rewarded for all those who follow the Sunnah. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Whoever has a means to do a good act, will get the reward of those who act upon it.’ (Jaamius sagheer 8670)\n\nDon’t be discouraged by the thought of pride and arrogance for this is the plot of Shaytaan to distract you. Fight Shaytaan and continue to wear the Islamic attire even if you feel proud and arrogant for this will be temporary. Soon, it will become your second nature and people will accept this attire.\n\nWe make du’aa that Allah guides you with steadfastness, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
