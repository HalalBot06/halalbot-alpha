  "question": "Is this true or such a taqwa should be maintained only if we get any proof that her habits are against the Islamic way. ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nA non-muslim woman is the servant of our home. My brother says that as she is a non-muslim, she may not be keeping purity and so when we use the toilet / bathroom which she also uses, we should wash the bucket & the cup and even he is saying that the pipe also should be washed, before we use it and otherwise our body will also become impure.\n\nIs this true  or such a taqwa should be maintained only if we get any proof that her habits are against the Islamic way. ?\n\n\n\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nCleanliness is an integral part of Islaam and it is the duty of every muslim that he is conscious about cleanliness be it with regards to personal hygiene or the environment around him. However to have an extreme attitude towards affairs, no matter what they may be, is discouraged by the Shariah.\n\n\nThe Holy Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) has stated:-\n\n \n\n   عَنْ أَبِى هُرَيْرَةَ عَنِ النَّبِىِّ - صلى الله عليه وسلم - قَالَ « إِنَّ الدِّينَ يُسْرٌ ، وَلَنْ يُشَادَّ الدِّينَ أَحَدٌ إِلاَّ غَلَبَهُ ، فَسَدِّدُوا\n\n“Verily the religion of Islaam is easy, nobody had made this religion difficult (by being extreme) except that they where not able to fulfill the difficult laws they placed on themselves, so therefore be moderate (in all matters).”\n\n(Sahih Bukhaari)\n\nIt will be necessary for you to wash all the abovementioned only in the case where the impurities can be seen on these things, or you are sure that it is impure. Other than that it is not necessary to place such strict and difficult conditions upon yourselves, by washing the bucket and pipe etc.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
