  "question": "I wanted to know would it effect your nikkah in anyway if you tell your wife without any intention out of anger \"maybe it was to early to get married\"?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1.I wanted to know would it effect your nikkah in anyway if you tell your wife without any intention out of anger \"maybe it was to early to get married\"? or \"maybe we shouldnt be together\"? or if you jokingly without intention point to a divorce sign and say to your wife be careful meaning you should be a good wife so this doesnt happen to us?\n\n2.In driving school you can get a certificate so you can get  your drivers license earlier and make your insurance cheaper. would it be wrong if without attending these classes and driving with the instructor you pay and get your certificate?Is there a way which you can make this right?or after you get your certificate can you attend some of the classes and do some driving with the instructor to make it right?\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. If one tells his wife the two statements referred to in your question, then that does not constitute Talaaq. The indication and pointing to a divorce sign also does not constitute divorce. We wish to advise that one should exercise caution in making such statements or indication to one’s wife.\n\n2. To pay and get one’s certificate is fraud and cheating. Islam teaches us to be truthful and honest.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
