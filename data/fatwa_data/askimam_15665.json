  "question": "If i start fasting without taking a bath weather that fasting is valid?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI knew that We need to take bath before praying if we masturbated or having sex with wife. I would like to know the same case in fasting. Suppose I masturbate or had sex with wife during the night time in Ramsan. Do I need to have bath before subhi(dawn)?..If i enter to fasting without taking a bath wheather that fasting is valid?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nBeing in such a state that one requiresÂ ghusl, does not prevent the fast from being valid. You may take the bath after the fast has already commenced, however it should not be unnecessarily delayed.\n\nPlease note that masturbation is not permissible, unless one spouse masturbates the other.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Husain Kadodia,\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
