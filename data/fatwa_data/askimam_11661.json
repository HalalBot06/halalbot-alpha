  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Is it permissible to eat kosher gelatin (as found in flavored yogurt)? 2. Is it permissible to eat sushi (spiced/flavored raw fish)? 3. Is it permissible to eat lobster, crab, octopus & clams? 4. Is it true that if a haraam ingredient is totally changed, one can eat it? Pls explain. 5. Can we eat kosher food? 6. What is the difference between halaal & zabiha halaal? 7. If food (eg halaal meat or vegetable) is prepared by a non-Muslim, can it be consumed by a Muslim? (if it is prepared in the non-Muslims home/restaurant or in a Muslim home without supervision, just trust). 8. Many are quick to label things \"haraam\" without proper research, or finding an alternative. Why?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We are based in South Africa and do not know of the kosher gelatine found in flavoured yoghurts in the States.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. This depends on the Halaal status of the spices and flavours used on the raw fish.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. According to the Hanafi Madhab, only fish from the sea is permissible. According to the other Madhaahib, lobster, crab, octopus, etc. are permissible. Every person must adhere to the ruling of the Madhab he%2Fshe follows.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. It is true that if a complete change takes place (metamorphosis) in anything Haraam, then it will become Halaal.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Refer 1 above%0D%0A%0D%0A6. Halaal means permissible to consume. If it an animal, it must be slaughtered according to the Shari?ah rights commonly known as Zabeeha for it to be Halaal.%0D%0A%0D%0A7. In principle, it is not sufficient to rely on the information of Halaal and Haraam from a non-Muslim.%0D%0A%0D%0A8. It is incorrect to declare anything Halaal Haraam or vice versa without proper knowledge. However, if one is doubtful, Shari?ah advises to exercise precaution and restraint.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
