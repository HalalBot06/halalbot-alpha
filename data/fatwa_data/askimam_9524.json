  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs Muslims, we believe that this worldly life is full of tests from Allah to test our Imaan. Allah Ta?ala states, ?Do people think that we will leave them to (merely) say we believe and they will not be tested? Verily, we have tested the people before, so that we know who are the truthful and who are not.?%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another verse, Allah Ta?ala states, ?Verily, we will test you with some fear and hunger and decrease in wealth.?%0D%0A%0D%0AThereafter Allah Ta?ala advises us to be patient. He also advise us how to conduct ourselves in such situations. Firstly, say ?Innaa lillaahi wa inaa ilayhi raaji?oon?. (Verily, we are from Allah and towards Him is our return). Think about the ultimate loss ? our death. We will realise every other loss is minimum and that will make it easy for us to cope with the situation. Allah Ta?ala also advises us to seek assistance with patience and Salat during difficulties.%0D%0A%0D%0ASister, we advise you as a Muslim regard your present difficulty as a test from Allah and be patient. Make Du?aa to Allah to grant you success in this tribulation. Engage in Nafl Salats and lots of Du?aa. You may also make Istighfaar as much as possible. The quality of Allah ?Yaa Wahhaabu? is recommended these times.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
