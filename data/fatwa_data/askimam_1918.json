  "question": "Is listening to Islamic songs such as by Yusuf Islam allowed, as they contain the sound of drums?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFROM THE DARUL IFTA%0D%0A%0D%0AQ: Muhtaram Mufti Saheb; Assalaamu Alaykum%0D%0A%0D%0AIs it permissible to listen to Islamic songs with the sound of music in the%0D%0Abackground. Some people assert that beating of the Duff (drum) is%0D%0Aestablished in Hadith.%0D%0A%0D%0AA: To assert on the basis of some Ahaadith that to listen to Islamic songs%0D%0Awith music in the background is incorrect. Several Ahaadith clearly prohibit%0D%0Athe use of the drum as well as other musical instruments. Consider the%0D%0Afollowing Ahaadith:%0D%0A%0D%0A* Hadhrat Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) reports that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) declared every wine, gambling, beating of%0D%0Adrums and every intoxicant as Haraam. (Abu Dawud)%0D%0A%0D%0A* Hadhrat Ali (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) prohibited the beating of drums. (Kanzul Ummaal)%0D%0A%0D%0A* The Kubah (drum) is Haraam. (Bayhaqi; Musnad Bazzar)%0D%0A%0D%0AThese Ahaadith are general and prohibit the beating of the drum. Those who%0D%0Aclaim that the beating of drums is permissible generally use the Hadith%0D%0Awherein it is reported that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said,%0D%0A'Announce the Nikah even though it be with the Duff.' (Mishkat)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another narration, it is reported that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) passed by little girls who were beating drums. (Ibn Maajah)%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, to use these Ahaadith to substantiate the beating of drums as a%0D%0Amusical instrument is baseless. The beating of drums on the occasions was%0D%0Afor the purpose of announcement of a Nikah or the arrival of somebody or the%0D%0Asighting of the moon. There is no evidence whatsoever that drums were used%0D%0Amerely for 'entertainment'. Rather it is reported that when Umar%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) heard the sound of beating drums, he would send a person%0D%0Ato inspect the occasion. If it was a Nikah (which was being announced by%0D%0Ameans of the drum) he would keep quite. Otherwise, he would punish those%0D%0Ainvolved. (Fathul Qadeer)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn contemporary times there is no need to use the drum to announce any%0D%0Aoccasion, nor is it used for such purposes. In these times, it is used%0D%0Acommonly as a musical instrument. The use of the drum as a musical%0D%0Ainstrument is expressly forbidden as has been clearly ascertained from the%0D%0AAhaadith mentioned in the beginning. Also, music itself is expressly%0D%0Aforbidden in Deen. Allah Ta'ala says:%0D%0A%0D%0A* Almighty Allah Ta%E3la says in the Noble Qur%E3n: 'And there are some people%0D%0Awho purchase idle talk. for them is a severe punishment'. Ibn Mas%F3od%0D%0A(Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) says that this verse was revealed regarding singing.%0D%0A%0D%0A* Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'Allah ordered me to%0D%0Adestroy musical instruments.'%0D%0A%0D%0A* Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'People from my Ummat will%0D%0Adrink wine and give it other names and singing girls and musical instruments%0D%0Awill be played before them. Allah will cause the earth to swallow them, and%0D%0Adisfigure their faces into apes and pigs.'%0D%0A%0D%0A* Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) mentioned, 'When singing girls%0D%0Aand musical instruments becomes common, wait for red winds, earthquakes, the%0D%0Aearth swallowing people, disfiguring and many more punishments.' (Mishk%E3t%0D%0A470)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the light of the above, it is not permissible to hear Islamic songs%0D%0Ahaving the sound of beating drums in the background.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
