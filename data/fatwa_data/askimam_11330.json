  "question": "Are the Baraelvis a subset of Sufis? Seems like they call themselves followers of ‘Traditional Scholars’ or ‘Traditional Islam’. What is the difference between Sufis and mainstream Muslims?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBarelvis are also from the mainstream Muslims ? Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaa. However, the following beliefs regarding Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] are incorrect:\n\n1. Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] coming to gatherings of Moulood.\n\n2. Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] having absolute knowledge of the future.\n\n3. The practise of Moulood and celebrating the birth of Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam].\n\nAll the abovementioned beliefs are incorrect. Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] does not come to gatherings. He is resting in his grave in Madinah Munawwarah. His knowledge of the future was not absolute. That is the sole quality of Allah Ta?ala. Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] himself or his Sahaaba [Radhiallaahu anhum] did not celebrate the birth of Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam].\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
