With these accumulated points instead of money, customer can buy goods from their company,it it considered Re`ba? 3. Am I allow to have car insurance that is required by government? Allah May reward you to help me concerning these matter\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It will only be permissible in the case of Dhuhr and Asr Salaats if they\nare performed after Misl-e-Awwal (when the shadow of any object reaches its\nlength plus the length of the shadow at the time of Zawaal). In the case of\nMaghrib and Esha Salaats, it will not be permissible.\n2. We require more details on this before we can issue a ruling (such as on\nwhat system do these cards operate? What uses are these cards applied to?\netc.)\n3. Conventional insurances usually contain elements of gambling and\ninterest, hence, impermissible. However, if one is required to so by law,\nthen he is excused.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
