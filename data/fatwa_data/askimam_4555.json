  "question": "Assalamoalaikum mufti sahab. i have some questions. kindly answer them.thankyou for your valuable service.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nQ1: Assalamoalaikum respected mufti saheb! kindly advice whether listening to hamd and naats who sound like songs, though they are without music is permissible? Here I refer to Yusuf Islam's poems like \"Allah is the only one God\" and \"Turn to Allah\" Q2: I have heard that for Hanafis it is not permissible to pray one rakah. i mean either pray 2 or 3 or 4. I live in Kuala Lumpur where shafai Muslims, after taraweeh, divide 3 witrs in two sets(of 2 and 1). they end the salat after 2 rakahs and then again make niyyah for one rakah and end it normally. so is it permissible for hanafi Muslims to pray witr behind shafai Muslims? Q3. Is it permissible to make assignments and projects on behalf of college students and charge them for it, knowing that the student is supposed to do it? will this earning be halal? if not on large scale, will it be ok if done once or twice? if its wrong, what should one do if the transaction has already been made? Q4. Many people say that Jihad is only done when all Muslims are under on Ameer. when there is no Ameer, there is no Jihad. In the light of shariah(kindly quote Quran/Hadith), kindly explain the Jihad of Palestine, Kashmir, Afghanistan, Chechnya is justified or not? because it is without an Ameer.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) It is permissible to listen to naats and hamd that do not contain music.\n2) There is a difference of opinion amongst the Hanafi Ulama on whether a\nHanafi may perform Witr behind a Shaafee. Our advice is that one should\nperform the Witr behind the Imaam, and as a precaution repeat the Witr\nthereafter.\n3) It is permissible to prepare projects for monetary gain. It is the duty\nof the student to be honest and not to deceive. You will not be responsible\nfor his misdeeds. The earnings will technically be Halaal. Nevertheless it\nwill be best to abstain from such dealings.\n4) For the offensive Jihaad an Ameer is necessary. For defensive Jihaad an\nAmeer is not a prerequisite. The type of Jihaad taking place in Palestine,\nKashmir, Chechnya, Afghanistan etc. is the defensive Jihaad. Therefore\nJihaad in these places is incumbent according to the Shariah even without an\nAmeer.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim"
