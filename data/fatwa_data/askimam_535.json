  "question": "Zakaah to a married student",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am 25 years old and live in Norway. My parents married me last year. Me and my wife are still studying, and my parents affoard our cost / sundries. And of course, my wife did get a lot of jewelery (gold) on our marriage. So , my question is : Do I qualify to pay the Zakah? Once again, I am a student, I have no income, my parent affoard all the sundries, but my wife got a lot of gold on the marriage. The quantity of the gold is more than 'nisaab' limit.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nZakaat on the gold jewellery is due on your wife and not you. However, you\nmay pay the Zakaat on her behalf with her consent. Zakaat may be paid in\ncash or in kind (clothing, etc.)\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
