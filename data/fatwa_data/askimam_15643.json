  "question": "What is Shirk, Fisq, Kufr, Munafiq, Fajir...",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalam O Alaikum,\n\nQuestion 1:\n\nWhat is\n\n1. Shirk (mushrik)\n2. Fisq (Fasiq)\n3. Kufur\n4. Munafiqat (Munafiq)\n5 Fajir. \n\nPlease give all possible details about these. Sometimes I have a very strong feeling that I am from one of them. By the grace of ALLAH ALMIGHTY, I am able to offer 5 times prayers with congregation but at times i feel i am not doing thing very right.\n\nQuestion 2: Three friends go to a hotel for dinner. Two of these have income from bank involving sood. At the end of dinner, one of the two pays the complete food bill inspite the third friend who does not have sood involved in his earnings insists that he will pay his own bill. Late the same night, three go to an icecream parlor and the third one pays the complete bill such that the complete dinner and icecream bill ration is 1:2. i.e. the third person pays a total amount more or less equal to all that he ate (food and icecream). Now, will this third person be guilty for eating Sood. What is the panelty and how can he get pure. Also, what shall be done in such situations?\n\nQuestion 3. Who are Aehl-e-Hadis and what is there Fitna?\n\nJazakALLAH khair\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1)      Shirk means to ascribe partners with Allah. A Mushrik is a person who ascribes partners to Allah.\n\n2)      Fisq means to disobey. In the context of Shariah, Fisq means to disobey the commands of Allah.\n\n3)      Kufr means disbelief.\n\n4)      Munafiq means hypocrisy. Munafiq means a hypocrite.\n\n5)      Fajir means a sinner. One who openly disobeys the Laws of Allah.\n\nYour feelings are the whispers of Shaytaan. You should continue to perform your Salaah, recite Quraan daily and make a little of Zikr. Do not pay too much attention to these thoughts as they are from Shaytaan.  \n\nSecondly, if the income of the person who paid for the food is completely from Haraam sources, the food will also be Haraam. You should therefore make Tawbah and Istighfaar and seek Allah’s forgiveness. Furthermore, you should be cautious of whom you accompany for meals. Associate with those who are conscience of Halaal and Haraam. The ice cream will be Halaal.\n\nThirdly, the Ahle Hadith are those who claim that to only follow the Quraan is sufficient and not there is no need to follow Hadith of Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم ). Their claim is incorrect as one can never understand the Quraan completely while ignoring the Hadith. There are some commands of Allah in the Quraan which are brief like Salaah. The details for these commands are explained in the Ahadith. The same applies to the Law of Fasting, Zakaat, Hajj etc. Furthermore, there are some Ahadith which are regarded as Mutawatir (those Ahadith wherein there is absolutely no doubt of its authenticity). If anyone rejects this category of Hadith, he/she will become a Kaafir.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
