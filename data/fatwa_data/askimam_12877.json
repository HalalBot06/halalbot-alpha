  "question": "Can I photographs as part of my advertising campaign, website or multimedia.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nBismillahirRahmanir Raheem Respected Mufti Saheb, Salaam Alaikum 1. I used to do illustrations earlier, i.e. drawing pictures but on my Shaikh's [Nawwar Allahu Marqadahu] admonition I gave it up and suffered along with my family a year of poverty and hardship. 2. Now I'm in the business of website design. But I have to use pictures (still photos, sometimes animated) in my work of publishing and websites. These are resources from photo archives of images of horses, people, such as photo of chairman etc. that I have to collect and download from time to time as part of my profession. Sometimes these references are provided by the client. Note that I have not taken these photographs nor have I drawn or illustrated them. It is a part of the client's advertising program. Can I include these photographs as part of my advertising campaign, website or multimedia. Please inform whether it is permitted or not. Jazakallah with Ahsanul Jaza Sincerely, Yusuf\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe concur with your Shaykh?s previous ruling and advise you to discuss with your predicament.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
