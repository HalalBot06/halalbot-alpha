  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is most certainly a bounty from Allah Ta?ala, that you be chosen to follow and be close to Allah Ta?ala, Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], especially in such unfavourable circumstances. Make lots of Shukr. In the Qur?aan, we learn that if you make Shukr, Allah will most definitely increase His bounties upon you. Also remember, if you are fulfilling your Islamic obligations and staying away from sin, then ?Do not grieve, Allah is with us.?
