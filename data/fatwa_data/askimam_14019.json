  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf Allah knows the outcome of our life on this earth, whether we will enter paradise or not, whether we are successful or not, then what is the point of our being in this world?  Many people gave the answer that it is allah's will.  Yet this is not a clear enough answer for the person who asked this question.  Therefore I would like to know if you think any different.\n\nAlso, I would like to know, if someone has a dream of certain man (and he is not religious) proposing to her, and a few days later his parents come to propose, should this girl get married to him.  Reason I ask is I have read in a hadith that the prophet (s) dreamt of hazrat Aisha (ra) many times before he proposed to her.\n\nI would very much appreciate it if you would give me an answer\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are two isues here; a) Purpose of our creation, and b) Taqdeer (predestination).\n\nAllah Ta’ala created us to worship Him. That is, we regard Allah as our Master and we express our slavery and servitude to Him. The entire Shari’ah and laws of Islam fall within this. Taqdeer simply refers to the absolute knowledge of Allah. He knows ahead of time everything. That, however, does not affect the will of an individual to worship Allah or do otherwise. While Allah knows who will obey Him, He created man and Jinn to give them the opportunity of the enjoyment and honour of worshipping and recognising Allah.\n\nThe issue is not only the absolute knowledge of Allah. If Allah didn’t create mankind just because of Allah knowing the outcome of man’s actions, then that would be a great deprivation for mankind.\n\nThe girl should consult with her seniors and also make Istikhaara. She should not decide based on a general dream.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
