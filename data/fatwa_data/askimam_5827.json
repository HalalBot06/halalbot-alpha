  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualikum Mufti Saab, Can you please interpret the following dream of mine? Last night I went to sleep very late almost 4 AM. I tried to sleep at the earlier phase of night but could not. Anyway after trying for sometime when I could not sleep, I started watching cricket match on the TV and slept late night. I saw in my dreams that there is very unusual hard inflamed spot on my left hand. It was so terrible that it so the flesh of hand is just looking like a roasted skin. This was so horrible. I just could not imagine the hand of mine of dream and get very much feared when I think of that scene. The next night I went to sleep and was afraid to dream something like this horrible. I again had a horrible dream where I saw that my mother was being killed by my father. Please help me understanding the dream and also suggest me if I should do something. Allah Hafez.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBoth dreams are insignificant. You should ignore them. You should not be\nafraid of bad dreams. That attitude makes Shaytaan happy.\n\nYou should make Wudhu before sleeping, recite the last four Quls of the Qur'\naan. It is not appropriate to watch TV. What if that is the last night in\none's life? Would one wish to die with the filth of TV in one's heart and\nmind? When you see an evil dream recite, 'Laa hawla walaa quwwata illaa\nbillaah', spit lightly and change position. Do not bother about the dreams.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
