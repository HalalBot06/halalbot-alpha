  "question": "I have discharged my Zakaat to a reputable organisation, but I have discovered that they bank the Zakaat money and distribute it during thecoming year as the need arises.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs my Zakaat discharged by merely giving it to such an organisation?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf Zakaat is due upon an individual, he/she should exercise precaution by\npersonally discharging the Zakaat to a recipient of Zakaat. If an\norganisation was deputed to discharge the monies, they should do so\nimmediately.\nIt is incorrect for them to withhold Zakaat monies especially when there are\ninnumerable Zakaat deserving cases, many of whom are being unjustly turned\naway from reputable organisations. The organisation is your Wakeel (deputy)\nin discharging your Zakaat. If they did not do so, your Zakaat will not be\ndischarged. Should anything unfortunate happen to the monies, for example,\ntheft etc. or incorrect dispensation, you will have to discharge your Zakaat\nagain.\n\nFrom: Al Mahmood 13 Q & A from the Darul Ifta\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
