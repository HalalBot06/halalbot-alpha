  "question": "A girl in my family is marrying an Ismaili man. Is this marriage halal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nA girl in my family is marrying an Ismaili man. The groom is an Aga Khani and so is his whole family. Is this marriage halal? Some thinks that he is a ?secret? Sunni since he prays like a Sunni and that his family says that they believe in Tauheed, Khatam-al-nabuwah and Quran. Moreover, Prince Karim Aga Khan has allowed his followers to attend Sunni Masjid for prayers and reading the Mashaf-ul-Quran. The Ismaili groom calls himself a Muslim and an Aga Khani, therefore, some think that it is permissible for her to marry him. But only Allah knows if the man is really a Muslim ! Should we attend the wedding? Attending wedding, would mean we support their act! If we break our ties with the couple-to-be then it is like abandoning your relatives who have some chance of coming back to the right path, and our abandonment would only facilitate them further towards the wrong path. What should we do? How do we convince others, including the girl, to follow the right path in this case? Is there an example you could quote from Sahaba or other great Muslims on handling similar situations?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIsmailis (Qadianis) are not Muslims. They do not believe in the finality of the prophethood of Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam].%0D%0A%0D%0AA person cannot be a Sunni and Qadiani at the same time, just like a person cannot be a Muslim and a non-Muslim at the same time. The marriage of a Muslim girl to a Qadiani is not valid. The concept of secret Sunni has no basis as there is no reason for the boy to conceal his true and correct beliefs. If a non-Muslim reads the Qur?aan or attends the Musjid, that too does not make him a Muslim. He will remain a non-Muslim until openly declares Shahaadah.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs family members, it is your responsibility to oppose the wedding vigorously. Would the family be part of a function where the girl is taken to be thrown into the fire? Every possible effort should be made to stop the wedding, let aside asking about being part of the wedding. Maintaining family ties does not mean to be part of gracing an occasion of Zina and adultery. That is what the relationship will be. The Sahaaba [Radhiallaahu anhum] never compromised with their families on issues of Aqeedah and faith. Is the incident of Abu Lahab ? the very uncle of Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] ? not before us?%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
