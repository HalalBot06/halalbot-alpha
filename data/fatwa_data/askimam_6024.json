  "answer": "QUESTION\nOne of Pakistan's top musicians, Abrar-ul-Haq is raising money through his musical concerts to build a memorial hospital for his Mother. Will the sawaab be given to his mother if he builds it? (as the money is through haraam sources). Please reply urgently as he is visiting my city on 29th June, and some of my friends donot belive what i say and want a Mufti's fatwa regarding this. Please reply soon. Jazakallah!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn the Hadith, we are told that Allah Ta'ala is pure and only accepts that\nwhich is pure. Charity given with money earned through music is not\naccepted.\n\nWhether or not his mother gets the reward is not an issue. The issue is that\nmusic is Haraam, and money earned through music is also Haraam. we should\nnever support Haraam.\n\nSorry for the delay in replying as the Madrasah was closed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
