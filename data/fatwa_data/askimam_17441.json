  "question": "I found out my girlfriend is pregnant so can i terminate my relationship with her?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nhi ive just found out that my girlfriend is pregnat, i dont want to be with her as i dont really think she is for me, would it be ok to get her to have a termonation as she has only been pregnat for 1 week.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh.\n\nWhat a shame on you! You refer to the girl as your friend. You sleep with her and make her pregnant. Now you claim she is not for you. What type of friendship is this? If you were sincere and really concerned for her, you would take responsibility for your action and marry her and also take responsibility for the child.\n\nHow evil is it is to fulfill your lust with the woman and now question about terminating the pregnancy. Is the “child” more important or your lust? Nevertheless, the girl is also responsible for this evil act. She submitted herself illegally and is now paying the price for that. Both yourself and the girl should make tawba and make the appropriate decision to marry. Abortion in this case is haram and a major sin.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
