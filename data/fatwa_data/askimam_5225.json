  "question": "Refuse non-Muslim(Hindu) friends that offer food(biscuits / sweets )? Am I creating the right impression of Muslims?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen my non-Muslim friends offer me something to eat I ask if it is not 'prayed food', and that it does not contain any meat/ meat products / alcohol. (In this way, I have been able to discuss a part of Islam with them) I would rather refuse, but sometimes accept because I don't want them to think of Islam as a snobbish / arrogant / rude faith. What is the correct response to them? For eg. tell them outright that I cannot eat food prepared by non-Muslims? (bad for dawah)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala says, 'Call towards the path of your Lord with wisdom.'\n\nIn view of the abovementioned Aayat, when you are offered biscuits, etc. by\nyour non-Muslim friends, respond to them with kindness by thanking them. If\nyou feel they will be offended by refusing them and that will be an obstacle\nfor Da'wah, then it may be wise not to refuse them. It is also possible that\nyou humble yourself and refuse the offer, that may be more conducive to Da'\nwah. Every situation may differ and you should apply your discretion to\ndetermine what is best suited for the situation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
