  "question": "Please help me with this mas'ala about udhr",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti, I am in a very perplexed situation. I sincerely hope you can help me because I feel that all my salaat and my fasting are not in order. The problem is that I have excessive vaginal discharge. For the past few years I counted myself as a ma'zoor, but after reading the details on your site about being ma'zoor I don?t know what to think anymore! This is because of the rule that one is only considered a ma'dhur when the udhr remains intact for the full duration of a fard prayer in a way that it does not even cease for a time in which wudu and salah can be performed. Now, I doubt my discharge has ever been so continuous in which case I wont be counted as a ma'zoor, but now whenever I do wudu for salaat, after about 2 mins, I am filled with doubts about my wudu being broken. This is because most of the time I cannot feel my discharge. So, how am I supposed to know whether I still have wudu after, say, 2 mins?? Due to these doubts the quality of my salaat has suffered greatly and all I think about in salaat is whether I have wudu or not. What I have been doing for the past few days is that after each time I do salaam I check and renew my wudu if there is wetness. I have done wudu as many as 4 times for esha salaat. But this can be terribly inconvenient when I am in a place where there is no proper place to do wudu. Please help me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not necessary to practically undergo an examining procedure for a\ncomplete salaah time to determine one being a ma'zoor or not due to the\nvaginal discharge. Zanne- Ghalib (owerpowering thought) is sufficient to\ndetermine that. If you have Zanne-Ghalib that the vaginal discharge is to\nsuch an extent that you are unable to perform wudhu and two rakaats of\nsalaah without discharge for any entire salaah time, including, the shortest\nsalaah duration any time of the year, then you are a ma'zoor. You stated\nthat in the past few days after you performed wudhu and salaah, you renewed\nyour wudhu, probably due to the discharge. You did that four times. That is\nsufficient for you to be a ma'zoor.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
