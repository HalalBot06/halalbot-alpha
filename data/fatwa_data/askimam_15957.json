  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease visit the website kmanoj.cash2all.com and tell me whether it is halal for us or not?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAccording to the sharia, every transaction that is based on one party's gain and another's loss, or if the transaction is obscure, is gambling (qimar).  Take the case of two persons competing in a race on condition that the loser pays the winner, or that a person says: If it rains today I will give you money, and if it does not rain, you will have to give me money.  Since one party gains and the other incurs a loss, it falls under gambling.  Another example is that of sealed boxes that are sold for a specific price while the contents are unknown i.e. the contents of each box may vary.  As a result, the purchase of these boxes which revolves around one's gain or loss being hidden is also considered as gambling.\n\nBased on this definition, the investment scheme mentioned on www.kmanoj.cash2all.com is halal and permissible. \n\n(Ma'arif Al-Quran 533/1 Dar Al-Kitab)\n\n(Adalati Faisle 243/2 Idara Islamiyat)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Ahmed Mohomed Pandor,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
