  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat's the Islamic ruling on whistling?  Please support your fatwa/answer with some text for the Qur'an or Sunnah or statement of earlier scholars. Thank you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nFirstly, it should be understood that not all Masaail (laws of the Shari’ah) are expressly mentioned in the Qur’aan and Hadith. However, through the principles found in the Qur’aan and Hadith, Masaail are deduced.\n\nWhistling, since it is merely, a sound emitted from the mouth is permissible. However, if it is used as a musical device, then it will not be permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
