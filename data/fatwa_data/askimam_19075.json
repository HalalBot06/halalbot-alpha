  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is the type of water left on the palm of my hand after rubbing a limb during wudu or ghusl? Purifying water or used (musta'mala) water?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\n \n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\nWhen a person washes a limb during wudhu, such as the face for example, one will cup his or her hands to contain the water. In this cupped position, the water will be rubbed onto the face. The water that drips forth from the face will be considered used (musta’mal). The wetness on the hand after rubbing the face will not be considered used. Water will be considered used as soon as it separates from the limb being washed. It is for this reason that the jurists have mentioned that if a person wipes his or her hand on a limb that was previously washed; the water that comes on the hand from the limb will then be considered used. Thus, the water left on ones hand after rubbing a limb will be purifying. However, it will not suffice to use such water to wash another limb in wudhu as there are other conditions of washing one’s limbs for wudhu which have to be met.\n\n \n\nوهو لغة إمرار اليد على الشيء وشرعا إصابة اليد المبتلة العضو ولو بعد غسل عضو لا مسحه ولا ببلل أخذ من عضو  \n\n \n\nقوله ( ولا ببلل أخذ من عضو ) لأنه يشترط في صحة المسح أن لا يكون البلل مستعملا ولما أخذت البلة من العضو صارت مستعملة بالإنفصال\n\n(مراقي الفلاح مع حاشية الطحطاوي عليه ص 60 , العلمية)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMuftī Yusuf Ibn Yaqub\nWashington, DC (USA)\n\nConcurred by:\n\nMuftī Abrar Mirza\nChicago, IL (USA)\n\nUnder the Supervision of Muftī Ebrahim Desai (South Africa)\n\n \n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER – AskImam.org questions\n\nAskImam.org answers issues pertaining to Sharī’ah.
