  "question": "What does Shariah say about the practice of BYO (Bring Your Own), where the restaurant does not sell or store the alcohol",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nRecently an option has become available for me to invest in a business. This business is a restaurant. Alhamdulilah the food is Halal, but the current owner who is not a Muslim has allowed the visitors to bring their own alcohol.\n\n \n\nIn this country Alcohol plays a big part of their dinning. What does Shariah say about the practice of BYO (Bring Your Own), where the restaurant does not sell or store the alcohol, the visitors bring their own alcohol, however they use the cups from the restaurant to drink it.\n\n \n\nIf I buy the restaurant in this condition should I stop their practice of BYO, or can I let them continue it so long as I have nothing to do with it?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAs Muslims, it is our religious and moral duty to invite toward good and prevent evil to the best of our ability. This ability varies from individual to individual. A father has the capability and authority over his wife and children in preventing them from committing evil actions. The Principal of a school hold this authority over the students of the institute. The director of an interprise/restaurant hold the authority to set the code of conduct for the customers that dines at his restaurant.\n\nTherefore, we strongly advise the prevention of alcoholic drinks in the restaurant. This will be in keeping with one’s moral and religious duty.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
