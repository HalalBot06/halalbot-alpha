  "answer": "QUESTION\nI just have a question , I am just 23 years old and I have a sinus and i live in the cold part of US northern virginia and whenever I wake up for fajar salaat i can hardly make (wadhu) ablusion I will have sneezings and then running nose andthe whole day will be full of cold and i just do tahmum these days. I am not sure what to do in the future and I have lot allergies and lot of cold and I don't feel good to make Tahmum but whenever I do Wadhu in winter I am getting cold and sinus everytime. Please advise me what to do.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHadhrat Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anha) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) asked, ?Should I not inform you of that through which Allah wipes off sins and raises through it your status?? The Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) replied, ?Yes?. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Completing your Wudhu despite the hardships and taking extra steps to the Musjid and waiting for one Salaat after the other. That is Ribaat (protecting the borders of Islam).? (Mishkaat pg.38)%0D%0A%0D%0AKeeping in mind the abovementioned Hadith, we should try making Wudhu at all times. However, if due to some illness, water is harmful and Wudhu or Ghusl will increase the illness, or Ghusl will increase the illness or delay its healing, Tayammum will be permissible. But if cold water is harmful and warm water is not available, it will be obligatory to use warm water. However, if warm water is not available, Tayammum may be performed.
