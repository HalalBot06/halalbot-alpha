  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n Wife and husband had a fight. Wife asked Divorce. Husband said \"I will give you divorce\". Please let me know if one divorce has taken place by this statement. Or this constitutes to permanent divorce.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nThe statement of the husband in English “I will give you divorce” will not constitute a divorce as that is a promise to divorce. It is not the actual divorce giving of divorce. Hence no divorce has taken place.\n\n \n\n(Imdādul Ahkām Pg. 387, Vol. 2 Darulūm Karachi)\n(Raddul muhtār Pg. 248, Vol.3 HM Saīd)[1]\n(Ahsanul Fatāwa Pg. 148, Vol. 5, HM Saīd)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl.
