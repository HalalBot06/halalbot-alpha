  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) One of my senior colleagues is always praying his Asar Salaat before 15-20 minutes of Maghrib. Sometimes even he is praying just 1 minute before. Please quote a Sahih Bukhari hadith, so that I can explain him the time limit of Asar.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNabi (sallallahu Alaihi wasallam) has said that it is the practice of the Munafiqeen (Hypocrites) that they wait for the sun to be close to setting, then they rush and quickly perform their Asr Salah.(Sahih Muslim No.622).\n\nIt is Mukruh Tahrimi to delay the Asr salah to such an extent that the brightness of the sun disappears and the yellowness sets in.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Husain Kadodia\nSTUDENT: Darul Ifta\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
