  "question": "I hope the stock goes up so I can regain my money. But I havent taken out the interest in it. Can I throw the interest out by throwing away my spare money and keeping my stock money?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have been doing investing with $2000.00 for about a year. I have made many transactions. My brother told me told me a small amount of interest goes into investor's money. He knows a lot about business I don't know how it works but he said a small amount should be calcualated and taken out. I'm going to ask how much I should take out. I have about 100 dollars left in a stock. I have also some money spare. I hope the stock goes up in sha Allah so I can regain my money. But I havent taken out the interest in it. Can I throw the interest out by throwing away my spare money and keeping my stock money? I have trouble understanding it. Maybe you do better understanding it.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou may calculate the interest amount in the investment and dispose of the amount from your spare money.\n\nThe investment will then be free of interest.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
