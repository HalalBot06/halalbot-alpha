  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a hanafi alhamdulillah. I have seen this fatwa of sheikh subayil on this website. I think its regarding accepting hanbali as a madhab of the imams of haramain.\nhttp://www.sunniforum.com/forum/showthread.php?p=20790. Can you please translate the letter to english ? Also,  as mentioned, Dr. Hakim has sent many letters to imams of haramamin on questions about taqleed to sheikh subayil, published in monthly daruloom deoband. Do you have any copies of them? Is there any maariful quran audio cassetes available or CD's? As a suggestion can you sub-categorize the categories -example like in prayers - subdivide in to faraiz, wajib, mustahab, sajdah suhv, sajdah tilawat, nawaqis salah etc.?\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nWe do not posses any of the letters in reference; we suggest you contact Darul-Uloom Deoband for the letters. We do not know if audios of Ma’riful-Quran are available. \n\nYour suggestion about the website is greatly appreciated and will be passed on to our computer department. \n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
