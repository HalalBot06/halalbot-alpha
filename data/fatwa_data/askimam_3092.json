  "question": "A woman covers her head with a white see-through scarf. Is the requirement for Hijaab fulfilled by covering her hair with such a scarf?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta?ala says, ?They (females) should not make apparent their adornment.? (Nur 30).\n\nThe word, ?adornment? refers to ?places of adornment, e.g. hair, ears, neck, etc.? (Ma?riful Qur?aan vol.6 pg.384; Darul Kutub). Allaamah ibn Katheer (RA) has expressly included ?Dhawaaib? (locks of hair) under the word adornment. (Ibn Katheer vol.3 pg.294; Darul Ma?rif). In view of the above, it is imperative that the hair must not be seen at all. Wearing a thin scarf wherein the hair, being an area of adornment, is exposed is contrary to the above mentioned order of Allah Ta?ala.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
