  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI know some one who made his MOHORANA   5 laks RUPI. But they never paid that money. He just aske his wife to forgive him about the money. And wife did so.\n\nSo, is it permissible to do like that.\n\nI heard that a husband can not even touch his wife before paying MOHORANA to his wife. (May Allah forgives me if I heard wrong)\n\nPlease, let me know in detail as to this sensetive issue. What should a man do who is going to marry soon???\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIn principle if the wife willingly forgives her Mahr, it will be permissible for the husband to have fi῾le zujiat (sexual intercourse) with his wife.1 However, it is below one’s dignity to mention large amount of Mahr at the time of ῾aqd-e-nikaah (nikaah ceremony) and then ask one’s wife to forgive her Mahr.\n\n(Bahishti Zewar, Pg.313, Makki Dārul Kutūb)1\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl.
