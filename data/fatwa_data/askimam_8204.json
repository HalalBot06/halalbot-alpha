  "answer": "QUESTION\nI'm 28 years old now. For my knowledge I'm keeping all the fard fasts(roza) during every Ramadan for the past 10 years (i.e. from 18 years old). Previously, I used to fast only 10 or 15 every ramadan. Now I want to make khaza of all thoses missed fasts. I'm planning to keep fast every thursay. Since it is sunnath of Rasullalh (sal) to keep fast on thursday. I hope I'll get that reward also. Is, what I'm doing correct? or what is the correct way to fulfill my missed fasts? How long I have to continue that as I don't know exactly how many fasts I missed?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFasting during the month of Ramadhaan was compulsory upon you from the time you become physically matured (Baaligh). If you did not attain physical maturity before the age of Fifteen, then you will be declared an adult by Shari?ah and you will be responsible to carry out the obligations of Shari?ah by then.\n\nIf you used to keep at least 10 fasts every Ramadhaan till before you were eighteen years old, then you have to make Qadhaa (make up) for twenty missed fasts for every Ramadhaan from the time you were an adult as explained above till before you turned eighteen. Your intention should be to make Qadhaa fast for Ramadhaan and not Sunnah fast.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
