  "question": "Is it halal for a woman to go to an Islamic university in a Muslim country and stay there by herself, if a mahram takes her there and a mahram escorts her back when she wants to come back?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for a woman to go to an Islamic university (all female) to\nstudy as long as she is escourted there by her male Mahram. Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), 'It is not allowed for a woman to travel a\nday and night's journey except with a Mahram.' This is based on conditions\nthat there are no facilities for her to study in her country.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
