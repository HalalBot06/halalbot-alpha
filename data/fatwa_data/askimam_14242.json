  "answer": "QUESTION\n\none certain scholar said from urkey said when someone has missed prayers he must not pray nawafil and the sunnah prayers related to the fard prayers.\n\nSo when praying 4 rakat sunnah before the fard of dhur he must make intention of praying a missed dhur, and when paying the 2 rakat sunnah after dhur he must iintent to pray a missed fajr prayer, and with the other sunnah's of the other fard's excactly the same. is this correct?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is compulsory to perform the relevant Sunnat-e-Muakkadah Salaats before and after Fardh Salaats. Sunnat-e-Muakkadah Salaats are generally referred to as emphasised Sunnat Salaats which are the two Rakaats before the Fardh of Fajr Salaat, 4 Rakaats before Dhuhr Salaats, 2 Rakaats after Dhuhr Salaat, 2 Rakaats after Maghrib and 2 Rakaats and Esha Salaat.\n\nOne cannot leave out these Sunnah Salaats in order to perform missed Fardh Salaats. Yes, one may leave out Nafl Salaats in order to perform missed Fardh Salaats. Nafl Salaats are voluntary Salaats and do not have to be necessarily performed.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
