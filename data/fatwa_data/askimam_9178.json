  "question": "Is the hadith related by Uthman bin Affan about the keys to the heavens and the earth authentic?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaikum mufti saab, I have a question regarding a hadith related by Uthman bin Affan where he asked the Prophet (saw) about the ayah?s in Quran that talk about the?keys to the heavens and the earth? (Surah 2 Ayah 12, and Surah 39 Ayah 63). The hadith goes on to say that the Prophet(saw) answered Uthman with a dua that he told him to recite 100 times a day. And by reciting this dua daily the Prophet (saw) said you will get 10 gifts in return which are enumerated in the hadith. The hadith can be found in Kunzul Amal, Abul Ya?laa, Ibn Abee Aasim. I read the hadith myself in a magazine called ?Virutes of Islamic Life?, the Daar-ul-Ehsaan organization. So the questions I have is (1) is the hadith authentic? (2) Also one of the gifts in the hadith that the Prophet (saw) mentions is that your nikah will be performed with hoor ul ein. Does this mean in this life or the hereafter (3) Also you have said that for one that wants to get married he should recite salam on the Prophet (saw) 500 times daily. Would it be sufficient to say ?salalahoalaihiwasalam? 500 times.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Allamah Suyuti has recorded in his al-la?alil masnoo-ah fi ahadithil maudu-ah that this narration is maudoo? (fabricated).\n\n2. See above.\n\n3. Yes, one may recite the short form of salam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
