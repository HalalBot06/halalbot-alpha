  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy sister says that there is no pint in wearing scarf if you are wearing jewelry Or bright dress but I say that I am wearing bright and attractive dress in ladies\n\n• I Am Muslim By Birth after my marriage I started wearing Abayat (Hijab) but I dint cover my face Hands or Feet when I go to party I don’t wear Abayat but cover my hair with scarf is it ok. Or should I always wear Abayat And if I don’t wish to wear Abayat is it a sin. My sister says that there is no pint in wearing scarf if you are wearing jewelry Or bright dress but I say that I am wearing bright and attractive dress in ladies but by chance men come in so to avoid that I am wearing scarf and more over I am covering my body so I don’t think I am wrong. My sisters say don’t wear scarf also as this is ladies party even if men come in for serving (Waiters) what shell I do ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to the Shari’ah, it is incumbent upon a Muslim female to fully cover herself in front of Ghayr Mahram men besides her hands and feet. If any part of her body, be it even a strand of hair is exposed in front of non-Mahram men, she will be sinful for exposing her Satar / Awrah, and will unfortunately earn the curse and wrath of Allah.\n\nIt is good to know that you have started wearing the Abayah and Hijaab. This should be worn at all times whenever leaving the house. If you cannot wear the Abayah for some reason and resort to wearing a scarf, utmost care should be taken that your head is well covered and you are wearing clothing which does not reveal your figure. You should not pay attention to what your sister says. She is wrong and trying to mislead you to fall under the curse and wrath of Allah Ta’ala.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
