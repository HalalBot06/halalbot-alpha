  "answer": "QUESTION\nJazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMessage and Method%0D%0A%0D%0ASome of the major concerns of the mission and method of the Prophet are%0D%0Aeloquently presented in a speech which one of his companions, Ja'far ibn%0D%0Aabii Taalib, made to the ruler of Abyssinia in Africa. Ja'far was the%0D%0Aspokesman of a group of Muslims who had sailed across the Red Sea and sought%0D%0Arefuge in Abyssinia from the persecution of the pagan Makkans:%0D%0A%0D%0A\"O King,\" he said, \"We were a people of ignorance, worshipping idols, eating%0D%0Athe flesh of dead animals, committing abominations, neglecting our%0D%0Arelations, doing evil to our neighbours, and the strong among us would%0D%0Aoppress the weak.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"We were in this state when God sent to us a messenger from among us, whose%0D%0Adescent and sincerity, trustworthiness and honesty were known to us.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"He summoned us to worship the One True God and to divest ourselves of the%0D%0Astones and idols we and our fathers had been worshipping in addition to God.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"He ordered us to be truthful of speech, to fulfil all that is entrusted to%0D%0Aus, to care for our relatives, to be kind to our neighbours, to refrain from%0D%0Aunlawful food and the consumption of blood.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"He forbade us to engage in shameful acts and false speech. He commanded us%0D%0Ato worship God alone and to assign no partners unto Him, to pray, to pa the%0D%0Apurifying tax and to fast.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"We deemed him truthful and we believed him, and we followed the message he%0D%0Abrought to us from God...\"%0D%0A%0D%0A%3EFrom Ja'far's speech on the mission and method of the Prophet, we see that%0D%0Athe first thing he stressed was the worldview of Tawhiid. To be on the%0D%0Astraight and natural way, man's first duty is to gain or regain a correct%0D%0Aknowledge of and belief in God. From this knowledge he will come to accept%0D%0Athe wisdom and authority of God. From this will spring correct action.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs an indication of this method of the Prophet, peace be on him, his wife%0D%0A'Aa'ishah is reported as saying that the Prophet did not start by telling%0D%0Apeople not to drink wine and not to commit fornication. He started by%0D%0Atelling them about God and the Hereafter until they had firm belief in them.%0D%0AIt is only then he told them not to drink or commit adultery and they obeyed%0D%0Ahim. \"Had he started by telling them not to drink wine or not to commit%0D%0Aadultery, they would have said, 'We will never abandon them'.\"%0D%0A%0D%0A%3EFrom Ja'far's speech, we learn that the Prophet encouraged all the natural%0D%0Ainbuilt moral virtues such as truth, kindness, generosity, and justice. And%0D%0Ahe condemned all the naturally repugnant vices such as false speech,%0D%0Ashamelessness, ignorance, and oppression.%0D%0A%0D%0AThere is also the testimony of Ja'far on the truthfulness of the Prophet.%0D%0ABoth before and after he became a prophet, Muhammad had the unchallenged%0D%0Areputation of a man who was always truthful and trustworthy. For this he was%0D%0Aknown as As-Saadiq and Al-Amiin respectively.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn fact, mission and method fused in the Prophet since we are told by%0D%0A'Aa'ishah, his wife: \"His character was the Qur'an.\" To reject the Prophet%0D%0Ais to reject the Qur'an and to reject the Qur'an is to reject man's only%0D%0Aauthentic source of Divine guidance.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe now have some idea of the importance of the Qur'an and the example of the%0D%0AProphet Muhammad in forming a valid and satisfying worldview for man in%0D%0Awhatever time or place he may live. Since the Qur'an is the final and%0D%0Acomplete message of God to humanity and since there will be no prophet after%0D%0AMuhammad, it is especially important for people, everywhere to discover or%0D%0Arediscover the meaning and relevance of the Qur'an to their lives. Whether%0D%0Ayou live in the north or the south, the east or the west, whether you live%0D%0Ain the so-called developed and advanced world or the underdeveloped and%0D%0Aimpoverished world, whether you are a male or female, young or old, the%0D%0AQur'an has a message for you. In fact, it is the message for you.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe have only had a glimpse of the content of the Qur'an and its purpose for%0D%0Aman. We have seen that it stresses the Oneness of God and man's duty to%0D%0Aacknowledge and worship God alone. We now want to look a little more closely%0D%0Aat what the Qur'an says about the nature of man, the purpose of his life and%0D%0Athe various choices and destinies open to him. In other words: Who are we?%0D%0AWhat are we doing here on earth? And where do we go from here?%0D%0A%0D%0APROPHET MUHAMMAD%0D%0A\"Never has a man set for himself, voluntarily or involuntarily, a more%0D%0Asublime aim, since this aim was superhuman: to subvert superstitions which%0D%0Ahad been interposed between man and his Creator, to render God unto man and%0D%0Aman unto God; to restore the rational and sacred idea of divinity amidst the%0D%0Achaos of the material and disfigured gods of idolatry, then existing.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"Never has a man undertaken a work so far beyond human power with so feeble%0D%0Ameans, for he (Muhammad) had in the conception as well as in the execution%0D%0Aof such a great design no other instrument than himself, and no other aid,%0D%0Aexcept a handful of men living in a corner of the desert. Finally, never has%0D%0Aa man accomplished such a huge and lasting revolution in the world...%0D%0A%0D%0A\"If greatness of purpose, smallness of means, and astounding results are the%0D%0Atrue criteria of human genius, who could dare to compare any great man in%0D%0Amodern history with Muhammad? The most famous men created arms, laws, and%0D%0Aempires only. They founded, if anything at all, no more than material powers%0D%0Awhich often crumbled away before their eyes. This man moved not only armies,%0D%0Alegislations, empires, peoples and dynasties, but millions of men in%0D%0Aone-third of the inhabited world, and more than that, he moved the altars,%0D%0Athe gods, the religions, the ideas, the beliefs, and the souls. On the basis%0D%0Aof a Book, every letter of which has become law, he created a spiritual%0D%0Anationality which blended together peoples of every tongue and of every%0D%0Arace. He has left us - as the indelible characteristic of this Muslim%0D%0Anationality - the hatred of false gods and the passion for the One and%0D%0AImmaterial God... The conquest of one-third of the earth to his dogma was%0D%0Ahis miracle; rather it was not the miracle of a man but that of reason.%0D%0A%0D%0A\"His life, his meditations, his heroic revilings against the superstitions%0D%0Aof his country, and his boldness in defying the furies of idolatry, his%0D%0Afirmness in enduring them for thirteen years at Makkah, his acceptance of%0D%0Athe role of public scorn and almost of being a victim of his fellow%0D%0Acountrymen: all these and finally, his migration, his incessant preaching,%0D%0Ahis wars against odds, his faith in his success and his superhuman security%0D%0Ain misfortune, his forbearance in victory, his ambition, which was entirely%0D%0Adevoted to one idea and in no manner striving for an empire, his endless%0D%0Aprayers, his mystic conversations with God, his death and his triumph after%0D%0Adeath - all these... (served) to affirm conviction which gave him the power%0D%0Ato restore a creed...%0D%0A%0D%0A\"Philosopher, orator, apostle, legislator, warrior, conqueror of ideas,%0D%0Are%ADstorer of rational dogmas, of a cult without images; the founder of%0D%0Atwenty terrestrial empires and of one spiritual empire, that is Muhammad. As%0D%0Aregards all standards by which human greatness may be measured, we may well%0D%0Aask, is there any man greater than he?\"%0D%0A%0D%0A(Lamartine, \"Histoire de la Turquie\", Paris, 1854.)%0D%0A"
