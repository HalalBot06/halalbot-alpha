  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have a question regardingÂ Durood-e-Ibrahim and Durood Shareef. Is there any difference between them? Can you please send me Durood.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Durood-e-Ibraahim is the Durood rited in Salaat. It is called Durood-e-Ibraahim because the Durood mentions Hadhrat Ibraahim (Alayhis salaam) in it.\n\n2. Durood basically means sending salutations upon Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Any form of salutation is referred to as Durood whilst the Durood recited in Salaat is referred to as Durood-e-Ibraahim.\n\n3. No, Nafl prayers means optional prayers. Obligatory prayers is referred to as Fardh prayers. The ommission of Sunnah prayers (especially the stressed upon Sunnah prayers) is not permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
