  "question": "not fiancially being able to support a wife - valid reason to delay Nikkah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Is fear of not financially being able to support a wife a valid reason to delay Nikkah? The individual would like to marry early, but his parents are saying it is not financially feasable for him to support a wife at this age. 2. What are the virtues of marrying relatively early?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If by 'financially able' you mean a luxurious life, then this is not a%0D%0Agood reason to delay Nikah. If a person has the bare means to sustain a%0D%0Asimple marriage, then he should not delay. In the Ahaadith, we are taught%0D%0Athat Nikah creates Barakah (blessings) in one's earnings. If the couple are%0D%0Aunderstanding, they will be able to survive happily on a meager income. If%0D%0Athe husband is so poor that he cannot afford even a simple lifestyle, then%0D%0Awe advise he adopts patience and waits until he can afford to bear the%0D%0Aresponsibilities of marriage. This is because today people are weak, and%0D%0Aprobably, the wife will continuously complain, which will make the married%0D%0Alife a miserly.%0D%0A2. There is no diety greater than abstaining from the forbidden acts. Nikah%0D%0Aat an early age protects from the many evils in our society. In particular,%0D%0Athe western environment we find around us is attractive to the youth and%0D%0Ainvites them towards sin. A young man who makes Nikah will be saved from%0D%0Athese evils. Many people measure piety by the amount of Nafl (optional) acts%0D%0Aof Ibaadat done. In this day and age, more important than optional acts is%0D%0Aabstention from sin.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Imraan Vawda%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
