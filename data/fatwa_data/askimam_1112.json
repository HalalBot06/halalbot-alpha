  "question": "What does Islam say about the eating/cooking with Hindus (sharing utensils)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am living with a Hindu room mate. And I was sharing all of my utensils with him and in the same time i was also using his stuff too. I had little knowledge about this act but I want detail explanation in the light of Quraan and Sunnah. Jazakallah Khair!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf all the food is Halaal, then there is nothing wrong in sharing the\nutensils.\n\nHowever, if the Hindu brings his own food then you should exercise\nprecaution by not using the same utensils before washing them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
