Please Guid me to the right path.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is your husband’s shar’ii obligation to support you and your children. We are not aware of the circumstances surrounding your husband’s joblessness. If he refuses to work and you are unable to approach him on this matter we suggest you refer the matter to someone who may have influence over him. If he is joblessness because he cannot find a job in his specialized field then he should be encourages to seek employment out of his profession as a temporary measure. The seriousness of the situation and the implications of breaking Allah’s commandments should be impressed upon him. You should also turn to Allah in earnestness to show you a way out of your predicament.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
