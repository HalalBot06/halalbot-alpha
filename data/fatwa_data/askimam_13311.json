(Al-Hidayah, Vol. 3, Page 67)\n\nTo risk money or property against another’s on the basis of the outcome of an unpredictable event such as a race or game or in the event where the loser pays the winner a certain sum of money, etc, are two forms of betting which take the ruling of gambling, and is therefore Haraam. Allah mentions: \"O you who believe! Indeed, intoxicants, and gambling, and idols, and divination by arrows are sheer filth, from the handwork of the shaitaan, therefore abstain from it; perchance you prosper.\" (Surah Al-Ma’edah, Verse 90)\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf"
