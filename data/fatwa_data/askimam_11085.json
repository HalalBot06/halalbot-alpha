  "question": "At what age Hajj becomes Fardh...will my children have to do again when they become adults to complete the Fardh (once in life)?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe are planning to go for Hajj next year Insha Allah. We have 3 children. Our elder daughter will be 13 years old (next year at hajj time), son will be 12 and younger daughter will be 10 year old. My question is if Allah gives us Taufiq to perform Hajj next year, will my children have to do again when they become adults to complete the Fardh (once in life) or this will be enough to fulfill the requirements of the Fardh.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOne of the conditions for the Fardh Hajj to be fulfilled is for the Haaji to be Baaligh (mature).\n\nTherefore, whichever of your children is Baaligh whilst they are performing Hajj, their Hajj will be fulfilled. If they are not Baaligh, the Fardh Hajj will not be fulfilled. (Shaami vol.2 pg.458; HM Saeed)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
