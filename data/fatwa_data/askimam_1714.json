  "question": "If you are attracted to someone one who is non-Muslim, is it wrong to make dua to Allah to guide them, such that once they are Muslim you could marry them?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI understand that becoming Muslim should not be done for the sake of marriage in itself, yet what is the position of Muslim men praying for the guidance of non-Muslim women in order to marry them. I understand that one should become Muslim for the sake of Allah, but it would be nice if they were to become Muslim, because then marrying them would be possible. But, please don?t get me wrong. One should always pray to Allah to guide non-muslims, but what is the process when someone you would like to marry is not Muslim, and you would like them to be for two reasons: 1) Islam is the CORRECT religion; 2) As a Muslim you can marry?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlmighty Allah Ta'ala creates means for a persons guidance to Islam and the\nstaight path. Marrying a muslim male serves as a means of a non-muslim\nfemale's guidance to Islam. Therefore it is correct to make dua for a\nnon-muslim female to accept Islam. to be able to marry her as a muslim. We\nadvise that marriage is a major step in life and one must exercise extreme\nprecaution in choosing his marriage partner. Non-compatibility between the\nspouses may lead to grief and agony and in many instances have lead to the\nmarriage breaking down.\n\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
