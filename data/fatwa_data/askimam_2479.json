  "question": "Please could you tell me about Al-Khidr?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome people say he is the living prophet and comes to you in your dreams - especially in Sri Lanka, which they say is the closest place to Heaven on Earth. They also have a mountain in Sri Lanka called Adams peak, they say a footprint there belongs to the prophet Adam but all the religions claim it for themselves.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are differences of opinion amongst the scholars pertaining to Hadhrat\nKhidr (Alayhis salaam) being a prophet and being alive or not. According to\nthe Muhadditheen, he was not a prophet but a Waliy (saint) of Allah who had\npassed away.\n\nAccording to the Sufis, he is still alive. Both views are well\nsubstantiated. The Sufis have the following substantiations: Hadhrat Khidr\n(Alayhis salaam) had come in an assembly of Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) to\npay his respects at the event of the demise of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam). Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) said to the people, 'This is\nKhidr (Alayhis salaam)'. There are also many incidents narrated of him\nassisting people in the difficult conditions.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
