  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI'm having a lot of doubts. 1. Touching an impurity breaks wudhu? I mean if I clean the impurity off, my wudhu will stay intact, right? The impurity was not from my body. 2. If non-halal chicken curry falls on my clothes, will my clothes become impure? Basically what happened is that my friend had long time ago fried non-halal (actually machine slaughtered) chicken patties in the pan. I washed the pan todayt. I have doubts that the oil of the pan directly or indirectly came into contact with my clothing and the area was perhaps more than a 50-cent coin. Will this make my clothes impure? 3. Washing impure clothes in machine makes clothes pure if the machine has two water cycles (that is, the water is changed only two times and not three times), provided that there is no stain of impurity? Please, I will be waiting for your reply impatiently. Jazak'Allah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\n1. Merely touching impurities does not break wudhu.\n\n(Fatāwa Mahmodiyyah, Vol.5,Pg.74)\n\n2. If you are not sure about your clothes being impure, your clothes will remain pure.\n\n(Ahsanul Fatāwa, Vol.2,Pg.83)\n\n3. If impure clothes are washed in a domestic washing machine, the clothes will be paak (pure).\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl.
