  "answer": "QUESTION\n(1) If one has a wetdream and the sheets of the bed are soaked with semen, and one does not wash the sheets and sits on it after it has dried, then does his wudhu break and does his clothes become napaak?? (2) How long before sunrise can I perform Fajr. Sometimes i wake up late and am just able to finish my fard a few minutes before sunrise...is this ok or should I offer Fajr much earlier?? (3) What duaas/practices can i perform to help me achieve my aims in my studies??\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If the sheets had dried completely and there is no semen left on the\nsheets, then by sitting on the sheets, the clothes will not become Napaak,\nand by sitting on such a sheet, the Wudhu will not break. (Hidaaya vol.1\npg.73)\n2. It is permissible to perform Fajr Salaat till just before sunrise. If you\nfinish your Fardh of Fajr a few minutes before sunrise, the Fajr Salaat is\nin order but is advisable to discharge the Fardh of Fajr Salaat together\nwith its Sunnats. (Hidaaya vol.1 pg.80)\n3. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has taught us a very beautiful Du'aa,\n'O Allah, we ask you of such knowledge which would be of benefit to us.' To\nachieve your aim, a person has to be fully dedicated to his studies and at\nthe same time, make a lot of Du'aa to Allah Ta'ala to assist you in your\npursuance of knowledge.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
