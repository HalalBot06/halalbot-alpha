  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) What r the differences between deoband and nadwa?\n\n2) And were some nadwis like maulana abulhasan ali nadwi associated with the deobandi maslik\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nDarul Uloom Deoband was founded in the year 1283A.H. This was during the rule of the English who’s mission was to eradicate Islam from . Hadrat Mawlana Qasim Nanothwi رحمه الله تعالى started Darul Uloom Deoband with the sole mission of keeping the teachings of the Noble Quran and Sunnah alive in accordance with the belief of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah. This is the maslak of the Ulama of Deoband. Anybody who follows this path could be called a “Deobandi” even though he might not have studied in Deoband.\n\nStudents studying in various institutes link themselves to that institute. For example student of Deoband call themselves Qasmi’s, Mazahurul Uloom call themselves Mazahiri, students of Jalalabad call themselves Jalalabadi’s etc. but they are all Deobandi’s in that they all follow the school of thought of Deoband. In the same way students of Nadwatul Ulama call themselves Nadwi’s but they are also Deobandi’s.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\nMl. Ishaq E.
