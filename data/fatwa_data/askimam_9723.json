  "answer": "QUESTION\nI love a Muslim girl & I am Muslim myself. I love her a lot & I want her to know how much I love her & how much I care about her. I came to know that she is not that good (she is not shareef) , she has committed some wrong doings but I don?t know even after knowing still I still love her ?.& I pray to Allah that may Allah make her walk on right path & that make her leave what she had done in past? & I want to tell you that I also had committed some wrong doings (I had not done sex but I had used my penis to spit out the liquid from it when I used to see nude pics or movies).But now I have left this wrong path & So I want to ask you that what should I read (DUA?A) to make myself leave the wrong path completely forever & not to commit the crime I had done in past & that I want that the girl I love to leave the wrong doings so what should I read (DUA?A) that to make her leave the wrong doings. & I want to marry her so what should I read (DUA?A) as I pray for all these things in every prayer & the thing is that I am a student myself & I cant afford to marry her now but I want that my engagement to be arranged with her so that I can continue my studies & that so that I don?t have to worry about her? SO WHAT SHOULD I READ (DUA?A) OR WHAT SHOULD I RECITE (WHICH SURA?H) SO THAT SHE LEAVES THE WRONG PATH & THAT SHE TO BE ENGAGED WITH ME AS I CAME TO KNOW THAT HER PARENTS WANT TO ENGAGE HER SOMEWHERE ELSE & AS I LOVE HER A LOT & I DON?T WANT TO LOSE HER.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for writing to the institute about your present dilemna. You%0D%0Adesire a certain woman to become your prospective wife.%0D%0A%0D%0AAn engagement between a man and a woman in Islam is not acceptable. When you%0D%0Aare ready for marriage and your match is found, your nikah has to be%0D%0Aperformed as soon as possible. The concept of getting engaged and then%0D%0Ameeting with and mingling with a fiancee is not part of the Islamic culture.%0D%0AAs long as a woman is not your wife and therefor not your mahram, you have%0D%0Ano right to be alone with her. Nor should you be gazing at her or desiring%0D%0Aher in your heart. If you have a problem with this, you should fast%0D%0Aconstantly to appease and control your desires.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou say you are still studying. This means you are not in a position to%0D%0Asupport a wife at the moment. You also state that her parents want her to%0D%0Amarry someone else. If this is the case, then you have no right to go and%0D%0Apresent yourself as a prospective husband. This action is against to the%0D%0Ateachings of Nabi (sallallaahu alayhi wassallam) and will displease Allah%0D%0ATa'ala greatly. Allah Ta'ala has set aside a partner for you so do not%0D%0Ainterfere with someone (**** Mufti, is it correct to say this? )else's%0D%0Ataqdir. Only the woman whom Allah Ta'ala has set aside for you will be your%0D%0Awife. Allow me to suggest that whilst you are studying, you set aside a few%0D%0Ahours a week to study more about the commandments of Allah Ta'ala. Study the%0D%0AQuran in depth so that you become more conversant with your Islamic duties,%0D%0Aresponsibilities, obligations, what is halaal%2Fharaam etc.%0D%0AInsha'allah, when you seek knowledge of deen which will take you closer to%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala, His mercy will descend on you. You should rather concentrate%0D%0Aon arming youself with knowledge which will benefit you in this world and%0D%0Athe hereafter. In this way you will be able to cast off whatever bad habits%0D%0Ayou have. This will also help to prepare you towards seeking a pious%0D%0Apartner. Perform your five daily salaah without fail, increase the%0D%0Aperformance of nafl salaah, especially tahadjud salaah, zikr, istigfaar, and%0D%0Arecitation of the Holy Quran and read it with understanding.%0D%0A%0D%0AAll Muslims are guided to seek pious partners who have the fear and love of%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala in their hearts. You will insha'llah be granted a pious wife%0D%0Awho will be a joy to you in this world and the hereafter. Ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best.%0D%0AWassalaam%0D%0A%0D%0A1Social Department%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
