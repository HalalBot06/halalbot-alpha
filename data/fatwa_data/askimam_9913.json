  "question": "Is it permissable for a female to ride a motorbike. I thought there may not be anything wrong as the women in the prophet's(pbuh) time used to ride horses and that would be a similar concept...?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA female is required to conceal the form and shape of her body to the best of her ability. That is not so when riding a horse due to the unique movement of the horse. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Allah?s curse is upon females on saddles (of horses).?\n\nThe Shar?ee prohibition for a female riding a motor-bike may be understood from the analogy of riding a horse. The situation of Dhuroorah (need) may grant a leeway. However, that is not the general situation today as modes of transport concealing the form and shape of females are well available and common.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
