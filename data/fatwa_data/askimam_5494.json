Allah Ta'ala had taken%0D%0Ait upon Himself to preserve the noble Qur'aan. He says, 'Most certainly We%0D%0Ahave revealed the Qur'aan and most certainly we will preserve it.' (Surah%0D%0AHajar 9)%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala first placed the Qur'aan-e-Kareem in the Lawh Mahfoodh. He%0D%0Asays, 'But this is the Qur'aan, which is in the Lahw Mahfoodh.' (Surah Buruj%0D%0A21)%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala revealed the Qur'aan two times from the Lawh Mahfoodh: The%0D%0Afirst time upon the skies of the earth, in the Baytul Izzat which is known%0D%0Aas Baytul Ma'moor. This took place on the night of Laylatul Qadr (night of%0D%0Apower). Allah Ta'ala says in the noble Qur'aan, 'Most certainly we have%0D%0Arevealed the Qur'aan in the night power.' (Itqaan; Surah Qadr 1)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe second time was the gradual revelation upon Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) over a period of 23 years. This revelation commenced when Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was in the cave of Hira in the night of power.%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was 40 years of age at that time.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe commonly asked question as to why the Qur'aan was revealed gradually and%0D%0Anot at once:%0D%0A%0D%0AThe same question was posed to Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), Allah Ta'%0D%0Aala says in the noble Qur'aan, 'The disobelievers say, 'Why has not the Qur'%0D%0Aaan been revealed upon him all at once?' In this way (we reveal it) that we%0D%0Amay strengthen by it your heart and we recite it beautifully.' (Furqaan 32)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the Tafseer of this Aayat, Imaam Jassa Razi (RA) mentions a few reasons%0D%0Afor the gradual revelation of the noble Qur'aan:%0D%0A%0D%0A1) If the entire Qur'aan was revealed at once, it would be necessary to%0D%0Apractice upon all the commands of Allah Ta'ala immediately. That would have%0D%0Abeen difficult.%0D%0A%0D%0A2) Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) underwent and bore many difficulties%0D%0Afrom his people. Jibraaeel (Alayhis salaam) used to come often to console%0D%0Aand strengthen the heart of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). A%0D%0Agradual revelation was necessary to achieve that.%0D%0A%0D%0A3) The Qur'aan contains verses answering the questions of people. Such%0D%0Averses could only be revealed when the questions were posed.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the beginning stages of Islam, the Qur'aan was preserved by memory.%0D%0AMemorising was the most trusted form of preserving any literature as people%0D%0Acould not read and write. If the method of writing was adopted to preserve%0D%0Athe Qur'aan, the Qur'aan would not have spread as it did so by memory.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala had blessed the Arabs with strong memory. A person would be%0D%0Aable to memorise over 1000 verses of poetry. A Bedouin was able to memorise%0D%0Ahis family tree, as well as the family tree of his horses.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, besides memorising the Qur'aan, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Aalso took special care in the writing of the Qur'aan. Hadhrat Zayd ibn%0D%0AThaabit (Radhiallaahu Anhu)says, 'I used to write the Wahy for%0D%0ANabi(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Whenever any revelation used to come,%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to feel very hot, drops of%0D%0Aperspiration like pearls used to fall from the blessed body of Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). Upon that condition, I used to present myself%0D%0Awith a shoulder bone or any means of writing, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) used to dictate the Qur'aan and I used to write. When this used to%0D%0Abe completed, I used to feel the burden of the copying of the Qur'aan as%0D%0Athough my legs would break and I would never be able to walk. Thereafter,%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to tell me to read. I used to read%0D%0Aand if there was any mistake, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) would%0D%0Arectify it and thereafter it used to be presented to the people.' (Itqaan)%0D%0A%0D%0AThere were many other Sahaaba besides Hadhrat Zayd ibn Thaabit (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhu) who used to write down Wahy. From amongst them were the%0D%0AKhulafaa-e-Rashideen, Hadhrat Ubayy ibn Ka'b, Hadhrat Zubayr ibn `Awwaam,%0D%0AHadhrat Mu'aawiya, Hadhrat Mugheera ibn Shu'bah, Hadhrat Khalid ibn Waleed,%0D%0AHadhrat Thaabit ibn Qays, Hadhrat Aboan ibn Sa'eed (Radhiallaahu Anhum)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Uthmaan (Radhiallaahu Anhu) mentions that whenever revelation used%0D%0Ato come upon Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), he used to guide the scribe%0D%0Ato place that Aayat in a particular portion, Surah, etc. of the noble Qur'%0D%0Aaan.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs paper was very scarce in those times, some Aayaat of the noble Qur'aan%0D%0Awere written on stone, some on leather, some on branches of date trees,%0D%0Aleaves of trees and bones of animals. However, sometimes it used to be%0D%0Awritten on paper also.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn this manner, during the time of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), the%0D%0Anoble Qur'aan was written and compiled under the supervision of Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0AQari Ismail Abdul-Aziz%0D%0AHead: Department of Qiraat - Madrasah In'aamiyyah, Camperdown"
