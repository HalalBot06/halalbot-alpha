  "question": "What’s difference between deobandis and the Arab hanafis?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. What’s difference between deobandis and the Arab hanafis? I don’t know which one of the two I fall into! Please clarify. 2 I was looking at he history of wahabism and I came to an understanding that Abdul wahab and Mohammad Wahab were father and son. Abdul Wahab was a pious person and his son went astray and people who follow his sons teaching are the wahabees. Is this true? Please clarify.3 What is special about entering masjid haram from the babu salam gate as some people make out? 4. I went for hajj this year with my wife and she was having difficulty in doing tawaf wida. It was too overcrowded and people were being terribly squashed. We did the first 3 rounds on the ground floor and then we did the remaining 4 upstairs. Was this ok?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. There are no real differences between the Arab Hanafi and Deobandi.\n\n2. Those who follow the ideology of Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhaab are referred to as Salafis. They are also called Wahhabies. However, in the Indian subcontinent, the Deobandis are also branded by some as Wahhabies. This is a mere coincidence, otherwise, there is definitely no link between them and the Wahhabies as Salafis.\n\n3. The Ulama have advised several methods as being preferred when entering the Musjid of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] for the purpose of visiting the blessed grave of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. Firstly, the Ulama generally prefer to approach the blessed grave from the front, i.e. side of the Qiblah, with one’s back facing the Qiblah.\n\n4. The Tawaaf performed in this manner is valid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abasoomar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH SCIENCES\n\nchecked & approved: MUFTI EBRAHM DESAI"
