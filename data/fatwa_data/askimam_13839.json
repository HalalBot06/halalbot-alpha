  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThere r many Ahadees that followers in Nimaz should say sura Fateha ,Â but in Hanafi mazhab v stay silent. Is it Ok.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, it is compulsory for the Imaam and for a person who is performing Salaat by himself to recite Surah al-Faatiha. A person behind the Imaam should not recite Surah al-Faatiha in the standing posture. This is the meaning of the different Ahaadith pertaining to Surah al-Faatiha.\n\nIf you follow the Hanafi Madhab, you should adhere to the Hanafi Madhab.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
