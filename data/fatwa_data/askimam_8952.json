  "question": "I am 14 years old. In New Zealand dawah work is doing well we have approximately 30,000 muslims. I would like to ask if tabligh jamaat people should do dawah to kafir...",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like to ask if tabligh jamaat people should do dawah to kafir. When i ask them they say \"muslims are worse then kafir , who will help them?\". I disagree with this . But I would like to hear some fatwa about this. Secondly in New zealand we have many Milladis, even sometimes some big miladis come from India (who disagree with jihad and only want peace) they hire huge halls and invite muslims and kafir and give wrong information about islam. But no one does any thing about this. I respect our alims and mufti in new zealnd but they don't do anything either. It is like impossible to change their minds. They don't even talk to non miladis. Please give us some way to help them and change their bidat ways.What should we do?Thirdly and finally in New Zealand we don't have much people coming foer salah. About 20 people for isha Maximum in my local masjid . In another masjid in the city it gets about 100-200 and more. Everyone goes there because the masjids big and its warme e.t.c. But every other masjid has an average of 10-30 peple like 1-2 saaf. No one wants to go to the small masjids because there cold and there is less people and no permanent imam. So the people close tothe smaller masjids rather pray home. How should we get more people to the masjid? please make dua for the new zealand muslims to get hidayah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTabligh work is a high and noble work. This word is handed by responsible Ulama. The people in the work of Tabligh are emphasised to remain within their guidance and advice.\n\nIt is our experience that those who remain within the confines of their advices are saved from so many evils and unfortunate situation. Most certainly, there might be a wisdom in not giving Da?awah to new Muslims. May Allah Ta?ala accept your efforts and grant you steadfastness.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
