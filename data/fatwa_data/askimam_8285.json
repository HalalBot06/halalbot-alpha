  "question": "If a person sleeps after hearing isha azan but wakes up before fajar, the salat will be qaza or ada?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamoalaikum Mufti Sahab! Is qaza salat supposed to be performed instead of ada (alone or with jamah), if a person sleeps for a while after hearing the Isha azan but wakes before fajar? 2) I have read in a Hadith that Abdullah ibn Umar divorced his wife, but the Prophet (SAW) asked him to take her back as she was impure. Bukhari 63.179. Your answer to a question conradicts the hadith.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If a person performs Esha Salaat anytime before Subh-e-Saadiq (true dawn), then the Esha Salaat will be considered as being performed timeously (Adaa). To perform Salaat with congregation is an emphasized Sunnah.\n\n2. Hadhrat Abdullah ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) divorced his wife during menses. That was disliked by Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), hence, he was instructed to revoke the divorce and if he still wished to divorce her, he should do so in Tuhr (non-menses period).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
