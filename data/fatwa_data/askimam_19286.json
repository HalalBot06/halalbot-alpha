  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am a practicing muslima, read salat and wear Islamic clothing. I try to remember Allah at all time and pray Almighty forgive me for any sinful deeds that I have done knowingly and without knowledge.I am currently working in a UK bank and despite searching for a job for the last year, I have not been successful.\n\nI am looking for a job that is not related to banking at all. I hate my job as I feel it conflicts my imam. As a banker, I am forced to talk about interest and insurance and I do not enjoy the work culture. I can't leave this job as I have bills to pay but I don't know what to do, so I feel I am stuck there. I have been applying to other jobs but I never hear back from them. I feel incredibly unhappy and I am asking for guidance. Is there anything else I can do in addition to normal Islamic life (reading namaz, giving to charity, reciting astaghfirullah)?\n\nIs the anything dua or wazeefa I can read which will help me find another job asap? Or is there a dua which can make my job bearable? I am not a good seller in the bank because I feel very uncomfortable selling these haraam products and this means I that I get a lot of stress and pressure when I am in branch as I don't hit target ever. Please help me.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\n \n\nWe are pleased to know you are a practicing muslimah; you perform salah and don Islamic attire. It is also pleasing to know of your quest to earn a halaal and wholesome income. We make dua that Allah grants you steadfastness on practicing on Islam and Allah grant you a halaal and wholesome source of income. Aameen.\n\nYou did not specify which department of the bank you work in. The contents of your email indicate that you are actively involved in interest bearing transactions. You also state that you have bills to pay and have no alternate source of income. Accordingly you should continue your employment at the bank and at the same time search for an alternate source of income. Continue making dua to Allah Ta’ala. The following dua is effective:\n\n \n\nاللَّهُمَّ اكْفِنِي بحلالك عَن حرامك وأغنني بِفَضْلِك عَمَّن سواك\n\nTransliteration: “Allahumma ikfini bihalaalika an haraamika wa-aghnini bifadhlika amman siwaak”\n\nTranslation:”Oh Allah, suffice me with that which is Halaal from that which is Haraam and through your virtue make me independent from anyone besides you”.\n\n \n\nMay Allah open all doors of ease and comfort for you. Aameen.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
