  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am married i like to know its necessary to take a janabat bath after sexual contact during ramadan months before subahi azaan or is janabat bath is necessary only if iam performing prayer and is the bath is not important for fasting ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe fast is valid even if one had not taken a compulsory bath before Subah Sadiq. The bath is necessary for the fajr prayer. The ghusl should not be unnecessarily delayed risking one to miss the Fajr prayer.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
