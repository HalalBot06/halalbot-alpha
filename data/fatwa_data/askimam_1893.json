  "question": "Ihraam for Women. Do women have to cover their faces in Ihraam for Hajj or not?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nShould they?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu √Ålayhi Wasallam) said, \"A female's Ihraam is her\nface.\" (Nisbur Raaya Zailee vol.3 pg.27; Dabhel)\n\nJust as it is prohibited for a male to cover his head during Ihraam, so too\nit is prohibited for a female to cover her face in the state of Ihraam.\n(Mishkaat pg.236, Karachi). In order to avoid evil glances of strange males,\na female should wear a veil without it touching the face. Due to unavoidable\ncircumstances, for example, medical reasons, she will be excused for not\nwearing the veil. However, at all times she should avoid being where there\nare strange males.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
