  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy wife is insisting that I buy her a tv just for cartoon and news channel. Can I do that? She has become disobedient and rebellious due to my unwillingness to subdue to her demand. She doesn't listen at all and doesn't want to listen to anything\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nJazakallah for the question which you have submitted to the institute regarding your wife's desire to have a television in the house.\n\nI am wondering if your wife is a very young person who is bored due to not having company or something interesting to do with her time. Have you tried to suggest that she takes up some studies? Either Islamic studies or secular studies via correspondence courses. She could also take up some hobbies which will be interesting and fulfilling for her. Do think about spending more quality time with her and help her to develop more interests. A good idea would be for both of you to decide on a course which both of you can share.\n\nYou say she has become rebellious and that things have become bitter between you two. I urge you to adopt a kind and tolerant attitude in dealing with her. Do not be too hard although you may find it difficult to cope. Remember, if you are harsh, things may just get out of hand. It will be sad if an issue over a television should destroy your relationship. You need to kindly remind her that you will carry the burden of bringing the 'box' into the house and that your love for Allah Ta'ala and His commandments are important to you. You do not wish to incur Allah Ta'ala's wrath by bringing this fitna into your home. We know that it is not possible to have only two channels on television. There are lots more channels which are unacceptable. However, even on the news channel, one is exposed to looking at ghair men and women. There is sports in which one views men and women in swimming costumes with satr exposed etc. She can always read the newspaper, listen to the radio and read news on the internet as most newspapers and news agencies have electronic pages on the net.\n\nThe bargain you want to make with her seems unrealistic to me. You wish to make a \"demand\" that she goes to masjid with you if you get her a tv. I get the impression that you are not sure why you have refused to get the tv thus far. This is a rather purile trade. You need to apply reasoning and the love of Allah Ta'ala as incentives. Afterall, she is your wife, not your child. I suggest that you often perform salaah with her, recite and discuss the Quran and share deeni knowledge with her. There could be so many reasons why she is making this demand. Sit down and discuss this with her as one adult to another.\n\nMay Allah Ta'ala guide both of you, ameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nSister Fadila\nSOCIAL DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
