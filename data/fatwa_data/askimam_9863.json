  "question": "Did the Prophet (SAW) divorce any of his wives? is there a difference between the terms Fiqh and Usul Fiqh? is there a Prophet that gave 60 years of his life to another Prophet?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSomeone told me that the Prophet (SAW) had actually divorced one of his wives, but I am with the understanding that the Prophet (SAW), although coming close, never divorced any of his wives, what is the truth? Also, is there a difference between the terms Fiqh and Usul Fiqh? I was told that they are not the same thing. Also, that there is Fard Sunnah and Sunnah, can you please explain this to me. And, is there a Prophet that gave 60 years of his life to another Prophet?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is correct that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) did divorce some of his wives. Allaamah Muhibbuddeen al-Tabari (RA) has stated that in total, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) had married 23 or 21 women in his life. From then, he (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) had divorced 6, 7 or 9 (according to the varying narrations). (al-Simtu thameen pg.230-231; Khulaasat siyaari sayyidul barhar vol.1 pg.632-636). An incident of one of those women who Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) had divorced is recorded in Sahih Bukhari as well (Haditgh5254-5257). Her name was Umaimah bint Nu?maan ibn Sharaheel (Radhiallaahu Anha)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The word Fiqh refers to the theological verdicts and deductions of the Fuqahaa (jurists). Usoolul Fiqh refers to the principles upon which those deductions are based. These principles have been deduced from the Qur?aan and Hadith. Each of these are regarded as separate subjects.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Your query about ?Fardh Sunnah? and ?Sunnah? is unclear. Kindly elaborate by means of an example.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Imaams Tirmidhi and Haakim have recorded a Hadith on the authority of Sayyiduna Abu Hurayra (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that when Aadam (alayhis salaam) had seen that the lifespan of Daawud (alayhis salaam) was 60 years, he (Adam - alayhis salaam) requested Allah to give Daawud (alayhis salaam) a further 40 years from his own lifespan. (Sunan al-Tirmidhi Hadith3076, Mustadrak al-Haakim vol.2 pg.585-586). Imaams Tirmidhi and al-Haakim have categorised this narration as Sahih (authentic).
