  "question": "Does a husband have the \"right\" to deny his wife to attend her parent's (mother or fathers's) Janaaiz?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is indeed surprising for such a question to be asked. The occasion of\ndeath is definitely a sensitive one, especially, if it is one's close\nrelative. It is, therefore, unthinkable for one to prevent his wife from\nattending her parent's Janaaza (funeral)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
