  "question": "Is ghusl fard only on that semen which comes out with force?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease forgive my lewdness, but sometimes i get an erection, and some clear liquid might come out, so i was wondering if that means i have to do ghusl?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn a male, 2 types of fluid emit due to sexual arousal. One is Mani (sperms) and the second is Mazi.\n\nMani is that liquid which emits with force and passion. This is a white thick liquid which causes the erection to subside after the liquid comes out. Mazi is that clear thin liquid which emits at the time of desire. Mani necessitates Ghusl and Mazi necessitates Wudhu. (Raddul Mukhtaaqi vol.1 pg.145)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
