  "question": "Interpretation of Istikhaara",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI read istikhaara,and after the third night woke before fajr remembering a good dream,i awoke Fajr time and forgot the details of the dream, i later awoke few hours later and felt good fo the rest of the day,but I dont remember my dream,can you interpret my Istikhara please?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is narrated in Sahih Bukhari from Hadhrat Jaabir (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'When you have a doubt%0D%0Aregarding a certain matter (i.e. to accept a proposal or not, etc.) then%0D%0Aperform two Rakaats of Nafl Salaat and recite the following Du'aa .'%0D%0A%0D%0AWe understand from this Hadith that the purpose of Istikhaara is to%0D%0Aeliminate the doubt which one has regarding some matter. Therefore,%0D%0AIstikhaara should be made with a clear mind, and without being inclined to%0D%0Aany side in that matter. Since the purpose of Istikhaara is only to%0D%0Aeliminate the doubt and uncertainty which one has, it is not even necessary%0D%0Afor one to see a dream or remember the dream if one had one. If upon%0D%0Aawakening, one finds his%2Fher heart inclined to one side of the matter for%0D%0Awhich he%2Fshe made Istikhaara, then one should act in accordance to the%0D%0Ainclination of his%2Fher heart. However, if one is still uncertain then one%0D%0Ashould continue making Istikhaara for 7 days. Insha Allah, the uncertainty%0D%0Awhich one has would be removed within this period, and one would (in most%0D%0Acases after receiving some indication in a dream) find his heart inclined to%0D%0Aa certain side in that matter. If one is still uncertain after 7 days, which%0D%0Ais possible, then one should resort to Istishaarah (seeking advice from a%0D%0Alearned person, etc.)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn your case, since you felt good for the rest of that day and remember have%0D%0Aa good dream, it shows that your heart is inclined to the positive side of%0D%0Athe matter for which you made Istikhaara. You should, therefore, make Du'aa%0D%0Aunto Allah Ta'ala to be guided, put your trust in him and go ahead in%0D%0Aaccordance to the inclination of your heart.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
