  "answer": "QUESTION\nq.9276 why not write,\"Insha-Allah, Allah Ta?ala will bless such a marriage which was enacted with OR WITHOUT the guardian?s consent.\" Does it state anywhere that a sayeda cannot marry a non-syed boy? pls give refs, U say its like joining ties between the families, But the couple will be spending their lives together not the 2 families. if the married cuople tell the parents it would lead to very very severe circumstances which could lead to worse things as u can imagine, ru saying they should get a divorce after being together for more than 2 years. How will the Nikah not be enacted? dua 4 1 2 lose anger. can u please give refs:After all we are all born equally. Its not easy for some1 to leave thair husband/wife after 2 years,\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not the conduct of a Muslim to get married without the guardian?s permission. It is the way of the Kuffar to run away and secretly marry someone. Since you have been married for two years, the question arises whether you have any children. If yes then get together with the Ulama of your town, explain your situation to them and ask them for help in convincing your father to keep this marriage intact.
