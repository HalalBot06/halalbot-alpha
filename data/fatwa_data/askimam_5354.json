  "question": "Please tell me if reading durood-e-jamilaa and other durood like that from punj soorah and other durood books is okay? please elaborate with example.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDuaa Jameela, Ganjul Arsh, etc. are Du'as prescribed by pious people. The\nDu'as are not from the Qur'an and Hadith verbatim. It is important that\nDu'as of such nature must be checked before print, i.e. the wordings are\ncorrect - sometimes due to repeated printing by different printers, there\nmay occur a misprint.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
