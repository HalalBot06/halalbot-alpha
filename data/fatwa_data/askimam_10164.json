  "question": "What should be done when the mobile rings during Salaat",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu Alaykum If during Salaat a mobile starts to ring, what should be done? Should Salaat be broken to switch it off? If during Salaat a mobile starts ringing and it is quickly switched off, is this Amale Katheer? Should Salaat be repeated again? Jazakum Allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf one uses one hand and puts it off in one quick movement, this will not break the salah. One should put it off, as it will disturb the other musalli's. It would be best ofcourse to put if off before salah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
