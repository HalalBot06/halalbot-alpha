  "question": "Problems with the mental state of a family member. My father-in-law is living with us. He has terrible habits...talks on the phone when there is nobody on the other side. What can we do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy father-in-law is living with us. He had nobody to care for him, as he divorced my mother-in-law many years ago. My wife cared for him until we married, and her sister thereafter. He was alone for the past four years, and my wife and I agreed to care for him. He has terrible habits. He does not make istinja, does not bath, does not perform salaat or fast. I have spoken to him on numerous accasions about the importance of deeni rites, but nothing's changed. I have two young daughters, and we are expecting another baby in a month, insha-allah. He seems to be mentally disturbed, as he talks on the phone when there is nobody on the other side. He talks to himself, and stays away from people. He was in a mental institution after the divorce, about 18/20 years ago. What can we do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt does seem as as though he has a mental problem. Why don't you have him\nchecked up by a specialist in this field?\n\nThis is a very difficult scenario you find yourself in. Bear it with\npatience and understanding. He is an old man and older people sometimes\nsuffer from such problems in their old age. Be more accommodating to him.\nContinue making Du'aa for him as well.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
