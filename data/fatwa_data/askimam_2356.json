  "question": "What is Tasawwuf? Is it right or wrong?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTasawwuf in simple terms means to adhere to the laws of Allah in every facet%0D%0Aof life. Kindly forward us your postal address for some literature on the%0D%0Asubject matter.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta%E3la Knows Best.%0D%0A%0D%0AWas salaam%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ARespected Brother-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0AIn answer to your questions and in order for you to get a better%0D%0Aunderstanding, we should be sending you a book, 'Shariat and Tasawwuf'.%0D%0AKindly send us with your postal address.%0D%0A1. Regarding Bay'at, see page 9 onwards%0D%0A2. Regarding the saying of thousands of wise ones, we should take advantage%0D%0Aof their experience and wisdom and heed to their advise. The more friends%0D%0Aone has the more he will mingle, and the more he mingles the more he will%0D%0Aspeaks. We don't have to elaborate on how loose our tongues are. Not a%0D%0Ameeting goes by without us speaking of a third person which in most cases is%0D%0Atantamount to backbiting, slandering, etc. which are all detrimental to our%0D%0Aspiritual lives.%0D%0A3. Meaning befriend people who are such that looking at them reminds you of%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala, listening to their talk increases your knowledge of Deen and%0D%0Aassociating with them makes you remember the hereafter and prepare for it.%0D%0A4. If we command someone to do something and he does it, then we befriend%0D%0Aand take a liking to him for listening to us. In the same way, we all agree%0D%0Athat obeying the commands of Allah Ta'ala is Fardh upon us. And if we obey%0D%0Ahim, we will definitely become his friend. If one did not become Allah%0D%0ATa'ala's friend then it means that he didn't obey him which was Fardh upon%0D%0Ahim. thereforem obeying Allah Ta'ala and becoming his friend both go hand in%0D%0Ahand and are Fardh.%0D%0A5. Shaql is a type of 'medication' for the spiritual body which needs to be%0D%0A'taken' with the guidance of a spiritual doctor (Shaykh).%0D%0A6. Yes, recalling their childhood will be of assistance to them in%0D%0Aprotecting them from the evil of pride because they must have also committee%0D%0Asins before reacting the lofty stages that they are upon presently.%0D%0ASecondly, it will allow them to tolerate the mishaps of their Mureeds and%0D%0Aadopt patience in their (i.e. Mureeds) slow progress.%0D%0A7. Saalik - one treading the path of Sulook or Tasawwuf (the path towards%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala).%0D%0A8. A true human being is one who respects and honours the dignity of the%0D%0Anext human being and nor does he cause harm to the next human being in any%0D%0Away (physically, verbally, etc.) How many of us despite our titles of%0D%0AHaafidh, Molvis, etc. have this quality in us?%0D%0A9. A spiritual doctor is called, 'Shaykh' and his surgery is called,%0D%0A'Khanqah'. The Khanqah is normally where the Shaykh resides, delivers his%0D%0Alectures and Mureeds come to stay with him for different periods of time for%0D%0Atheir spiritual upliftment.%0D%0A%0D%0AFinally, we request you to make special Du'a for our Shaykh, Moulana Farouk%0D%0ASaheb (RA) who suddenly passed away in May this year (1999)%0D%0A"
