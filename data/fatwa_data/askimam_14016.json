  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nwhat is the meaning of curse as in when allah curses someone, what is the meaning of  curse and also when allah says in the quran wayl, (woe) what does that mean as in surah humaza. jaza kallah khair\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. La’nah or curse refers to ‘the lack of or removal from the mercy of Allah’. If a person is cursed either in the Qur’aan or Hadith, it means that due to his sin, he is far away from the mercy of Allah and a sort of admonishment for him to rectify himself and revert to the mercy of Allah.\n\n2. Wayl means ‘woe unto him’ or may a curse befall him. It could also refer to the name of a valley in Jahannum.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
