  "answer": "QUESTION\n\npls tell me if i see after going to the mosque that Fajr jamat has started and i'm sure that i'll miss the jamat if i perform Sunnah - then what should i do - join jamat or first perform sunnah? And if i don't (have to) perfom sunnah when should it be performed - after sunrise or before?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are two situations with the Sunnat of Fajr\n\n• If you read the Sunnat you will be able to join the congregation\n\n• If you read the Sunnat Salaah you will not be able to join the congregation\n\nIn the first situation it is necessary to perform the Sunnat Salaah and then join the Jama’ah. However, if you are confident that if you will perform the Sunnat Salaah, you will miss the Jama’ah, then leave the Sunnat and join the congregation.\n\nIf you had joined the congregation without performing the Sunnats, there is no Qadha (make up) for it. Qadha for the sunnats will only be made if the Sunnats was missed with the Fardh of Fajr. (Shaami)\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
