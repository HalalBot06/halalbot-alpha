  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHadhrat ibn Mas'ood (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) narrates that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'I used to stop you from visiting%0D%0Agraves, (now) visit the graves for it creates abstention (in love) for the%0D%0Aworld and reminds of the hereafter. (Mishkaat p. 154 - Qadeemi)%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the above Ahaadith, it is clear that visiting graves was prohibited for%0D%0Aall (men and women), and thereafter the prohibition was abrogated.%0D%0ATherefore, it is Mustahabb for males to visit graves. With regard to%0D%0Afemales, see the following Ahaadith:%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Huryara (Radhiallaahu %C1nhu) narrates that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) cursed women who visit the graveyards.%0D%0A(Mishkaat p. 154 - Qadeemi)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Aaisha (Radhiallaahu %C1nha) said to Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) 'Oh Prophet of Allah what should I say when visiting the graves',%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Assalaamu Alaa ahlud diyaar%0D%0Aminal mu'mineena wal muslimeena wayarhamu Allaahu al-mustaqdimeena minnaa%0D%0Awal must'akhireena, wa innaa inshaa'a Allaahu bikum lalaahiqoona%0D%0A%0D%0AWhile Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) taught Hadhrat Aaisha%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu %C1nha) the Du'a when visiting the graves, he also cursed%0D%0Afemales from doing so.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe reason for prohibiting females from visiting graves is due to our%0D%0Acorrupted environment wherein women who do not adhere to the laws of Hijaab%0D%0Aand hence strange men are attracted towards them. Therefore, it is not%0D%0Apermissible for young females to visit the graveyard.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, if the laws of the Shariah (Hijaab, intermingling, crying, etc.)%0D%0Aare not violated then the prohibition may be set aside. Since generally the%0D%0Awomen visiting the graves are not free from the above aspects, they should%0D%0Arefrain from doing so.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf a female visits the grave to remember death and soften without crying .%0D%0Athere is nothing wrong if they are old. It is Makrooh (not permissible) if%0D%0Athey are young (Shaami vol. 1 p. 665 - Maajidiyya)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
