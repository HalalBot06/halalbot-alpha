  "question": "credit cards usage",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCredits Cards usage\n\nAll my income generated is in the form of 'electronic money' and the majority of expenses is made electronically as well. I make use of credit cards extensively more as a matter of convenience and cost efficiency. The intent of my usage is genuinely not to spend money which I dont own / have and thus purchase on interest. In fact, this is how I use all my cards...\n\n·   I buy almost everything (including food), on my cards, but ALWAYS pay the full outstanding amount (or more) before the due date - thus I avoid paying any interest / finance charges\n\n·    I always ensure that, at ANY one time, I have more current funds available to cover ALL my cards' oustanding amounts ie. I am able to pay ALL outstanding amounts by ONE transaction at any time of the day, without any delay if requested. Basically, I am not spending more money than i actually have.\n\n·    The only charges that I pay is an annual fee for the convenience of usage of the card. This is one off and unrelated to any interest rate / value of transactions / number of transactions.\n\n·    I sometimes attract interest - by no fault of mine - because once in a while, perhaps, once in 2 years or so, I receive statements late. Because I detest the paying of interest, I always justifiably complain and insist on it being reversed. It usually is..\n\n·   On the odd occasion my accounts 'earn' me (literally) a few cents in interest because I may sometimes deposit just a little more money into those credits card accounts when I settle them every month. I periodically calculate this interest, add it up and DISPOSE of it (eg. to an animal welfare organisation - not a human / muslim organisation) no matter how insignificant / negligible / little / much this amount may be, WITHOUT the expectation of sawaab.\n\n·  Bascially, I use my card as a form of payment,  just like others may use eg. a cheque \n\nIs the way I use my cards permissible?? If not, please advise how could I amend my practice to maintain this convenience without paying exorbitant bank charges in the form of cash withdrawals and exposing myself to the unnecessary security risk of having to carry around large sums of cash with me on my person\n\nI was weary of vice of interest but became more educated about its punishments from the shari'ah compliant business campaign supported by your madressah. My ALLAH continue to provide the repected Ulema with ilm, hidaayat and clarity to be able to continue to guide us, the members of this Ummah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAlhamdulillah, it is very encouraging to note that you have benefitted from the Shari’ah Compliant Business campaign of our Madrasah.\n\nYour use of the credit card facility is appropriate. You could also dispose of the interest amount by giving it to a poor and needy person.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
