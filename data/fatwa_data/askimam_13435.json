  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf a lady passes away and leave behind Husband, 3 Sons and 4 Daughters as heirs. What will be the Sharai distribution of inheritence among them.\n\nHighly appreciate if you could explain the method that is used to calculate portion of each heir.\n\nJazakumullahu Khairan\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to the Islamic Law of Succession and Inheritance, distribution of an Estate will only commence after funeral expenses, debts (including legal costs) and bequests (if any) made to non-heirs - which will not exceed one-third (1/3) of the Estate after debts and funeral expenses - have been settled. Thereafter, all assets form part of the Nett Estate and will have to be distributed according to the Islamic Law of Succession and Inheritance.\n\nThe nett Estate will be divided into 40 equal shares and distributed as follows: Husband will inherit Â¼ (10 shares). The residue will go to the children. Each son will inherit 6 shares and each daughter 3 shares.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
