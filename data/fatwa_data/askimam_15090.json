There is a need to safe keep ones money. Cheques and drafts are common modes of payments and exchanges. Many instances they are even requirements. In view of such difficulties, the Ulama have granted a leeway to deposit money in conventional banks and use other facilities of such banks which are not un-Islamic. This leeway is granted as a need and could be used only to the extent of the need. One cannot go beyond the need and use the un-Islamic facilities of the bank for example the un-Islamic investments etc.\nIt is fardh to make jihad against ones nafs and train ones nafs to abide by shariah. Our greatest enemy is the nafs and shaitaan.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
