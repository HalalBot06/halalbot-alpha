  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan you give an example of a person who is alive. Who enters paradise?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nGranting enterance into paradise is the sole right of Allah. It is not for us to think who will enter paradise.\n\nHowever, whilst we are extremely weak, we hope Allah will deal with us just as a mother deals with her newly born child. Insha Allah, we only hope for Allah's Mercy.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
