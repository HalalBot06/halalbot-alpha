  "answer": "QUESTION\nI used to work as a teller for a bank in USA. Currently I am working as a teller supervisor. As a part of my job, at times I am also involved in opening new accounts for customers. I am curious to know what is the ruling in this case? 1- All the money that I have earned, is it considered Haram? Is there anything that I can do about it? (it is a fairly huge amount) 2- Can I use this money at all? 3- Can my husband and I use this money to purchase a house? He is in the IT industry (he doesn?t work in a bank). Him and I had agreed that we both will work until we don?t have children, so we can save up some money for a house and Hajj. Now my husband doesn?t want to use my share money towards the house because he thinks it?s wrong. 4- My bank also gives me money for School tuition. Insha Allaah I will be finishing college by December 2004. Unfortunately, We cannot pay the tuition on our own, because the Tuition Free is very high. So would it be ok, if I work at the bank until I Finish School this year. May Allah Bless You. Allah Hafiz\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe money that the bank gives you for your tuition is obviously considered part of your salary. The reason for them bearing this cost is because you are working for them. This will also be considered as not permissible.\n\nYou may take a loan from a Kaafir for the amount you have, use that and repay him with your own money.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
