  "question": "If there are a group of men who want to make a Jamaat, how do they select who the Imam should be, in other words, is there a checklist as to who qualifies to lead the Salaat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe first item would probably be, one who knows by heart, the most Qur?an, and so on?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe most preferred verdict is that most knowledgeable will lead the Salat.\n\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'The most well versed in recitation\nof the Qur'aan is Ubayy ibn Ka'ab (Radhiallaahu Anhu)' but despite that Nabi\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) appointed Abu Bakr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) who was\nthe most knowledgeable to lead the Salaat. (Tirmidhi pg.55). If there is no\nknowledgeable person, then the most wellversed in recitation, then the most\npious, then the eldest, then the best of them in character.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
