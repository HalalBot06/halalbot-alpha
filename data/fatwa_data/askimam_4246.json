  "question": "Today is Thanksgiving Thursday (4th Thus. in Nov.) in USA, when Americans feast on Turkeys. Can we Muslims participate in it, by wishing and offering a Turkey to our non-Muslim friends? (see details)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMore information on this historic event is available at: http://www.usis.usemb.se/Holidays/celebrate/thanksgi.html ? In order to please my friend or neighbor, can I offer them a Turkey (skinned meat) purchased at the local American store (in it?s original packing, to be on the safe side)? ? If so, is it OK that I am buying something for them that is not Zabiha (like I mentioned, they?ll be worried to accept the kind of meat we buy, and since the meat is in it?s original packing from an American Supermarket, there is no liability for me)? And who knows, this way they will open up with me, and will be more receptive when I talk to them about Islam. ? If we Muslims also eat (zabiha) Turkey (since this is made available in stores for this holiday) in this time, are we sinful of imitating them?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe have studied the background of Thanksgiving day- to express gratitude to\nthe favours of the natives of the 16th century. IN principal to express\ngratefulness and gratitude for favours rendered is encouraged. However,\nThanksgiving being a national holiday express its salient position in the\nAmerican culture, which has many unislamic values and principles.\nCelebrating Thanksgiving purposefully or subordinately is an expression of\naccepting the general American Culture. It is not celebrated independent of\nthe American Culture. In view of the above it is not permissible to\ncelebrate Thanksgiving Day.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
