  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know about the usool which states that \"anything In Ibadah is haraam unless we find authentic evidence to support it\". For example, everything we do in prayer must be based on authentic hadith and we can't just add ourselves what we \"think \" is appropriate. I also heard from scholars that it is one of the requirement of Tawhid-al-Uloohiyah that \"Worship must be in accordance with the commands of Allah and His messenger (pbuh). Based on that, I would like to know if Dhikr is also considered as Ibadah. If it is, then we can't have specific rules that prescribed by \"Peer\" and sufis thatt are not proven by authentic sunnah. What is your opinion on that? Jazakallah khair\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAllah sent for our guidance Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] as the final messenger. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has shown us the way to gain the happiness of Allah. Allah has made certain acts Fardh (compulsory) on mankind. Salaat, Hajj, Zakaat, Sawm have been made compulsory on us together with this Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has shown us how to implement these acts.\n\nAny deviation from what Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has shown to us is not permissible. Dhikr is an ibaadat through which we gain the happiness of Allah. This is an optional prayer. There are numerous Ahaadith mentioning different Dhikrs. What the Sufis prescribe is that which has been found through experience to be beneficial and spiritually uplifting. As long as these Azkaar are not in conflict of any of laws of Allah, it is permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
