  "question": "What rights a husband has or his wifeâ€™s income (Both husband and wife are working)",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat rights a husband has or his wife?s income (Both husband and wife are working)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFirstly, the wife may only work if no rule of the Shari'ah is violated, e.g.\nshe does not mingle with men, and does not leave the home unnecessarily.\n\nWhat each spouse earns is theirs, and the other has no right over such\nearnings. It is the duty of the husband to maintain the wife, even though\nshe may be earning. As long as he maintains her, she has no other right over\nhis wealth. This is from a legal aspect.\n\nMorally, each spouse should be accommodative and spend freely on the other,\nalthough not obliged to.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
