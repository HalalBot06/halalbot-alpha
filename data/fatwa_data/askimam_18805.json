  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question is i have so many hair on whole leg, arm and belly area. somany mean lots of big hair. I can't even wear shorts. i am only 17 year old. someone suggest me to trim it or wax it. But i think trim or wax is haram in Islam. I don't know what to do? Should i wax hair or not?\n\nAnd do you know why do i have so many hair? In my whole family nobody hair hair on leg? Why do i have? I don't really know what to do now? Please help me. It is very important for me. it is summer right now and i can't wear short pant or half pant. and i can't go out with friends. my all friends wear half pant. why i can not?\nIs there any islamic reason? because until last year i really dont pray salat. i was praying only jumma and some of magrib. but i do pray now most of all.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nFirst of all, as Muslims we should acknowledge, rather, be convinced that Allah Ta’ala is our Creator who has fashioned us in the most sublime, magnificent and grand manner. Our hearts should beam with appreciation that Allah Ta’ala has included us from being amongst the human race; He could have made us swines, dogs, cats, fish, etc. and, in this form also, we would have still been His creation. Yet, Allah has purposely selected us to be from amongst the greatest, most superlative and paragon of them all, human beings (insaan), Alhamdulillah.\n\nFurthermore, Allah had created us as humans and till today has maintained us in this form. The Quran explicitly mentions about those nations prior to us who disobeyed Allah Ta’ala and from being Human, Allah transformed them to apes and swines. Reflect for a moment, how much haven’t we disobeyed Allah? How much of His authoritive commands haven’t we trampled and violated? Yet, did at any time, Allah convert us into an ape, or something of that sort? Never, and yet again, Alhamdulillah!\n\nNonetheless, whilst you have taken out valuable time to scrutinize and examine the hair on your leg, why not shift your attention for a while (to scrutinize, examine and appreciate) the skin of the same leg; reflect on the important role it plays in your life. Hasn’t Allah created your skin in a most amazing texture, colour and style? Hasn’t Allah created the pores on your leg, allowing perspiration to emit, something extremely vital in regulating your body temperature? Hasn’t He granted you a pair of firm solid pieces of bone (the legs) upon which you easily gain support, stand, recline, etc.? Hasn’t He created the marrow in the same bone, without which you would not be able to walk? Hasn’t Allah also created the veins and arteries which tranquilly flow like rivers in your leg beneath the “long hairs”?\n\nRespected brother, all which is needed, is just a deeper glance; instead of the hair, concentrate on that beneath the hair. In this, will you find your happiness, appreciation, and answers. You will realize that there are much more things in life to cheer us up with rather than to grieve us. Just shift your attention and you’ll be a happy person again, Inshallah! You may well consider the famous phrase which goes,\n\nChange the way you look at things, and the things around you will also change!\n\nYes, even if we have to assume that your hair is extremely and unbearably long, sincerely ask yourself, “Is it at all fair that I worry about the few strands whereas Allah has blessed me with plentiful of other bounties (as was enumerated previously)?” leave aside pondering over the “pleasures” you seem to be missing, rather think of the treasures Allah has created you with!\n\nFurthermore, your appreciation to Allah Ta’ala should be compounded more so when you mention omitting so many salahs, ultimately disobeying Allah Ta’ala, yet Allah Ta’ala maintained your physical features, Alhamdulillah!\n\nAnother angle to understand the situation is that, even with the slightly longer hair, Allah has actually being protecting you from wearing those clothing where your thighs would have had to be exposed, the exposing of which is totally abhorred and detested (Haram) in Islam equally whether there is hair on it or not.\n\nNonetheless, as a male, it is normal to have hair growing on the leg. Those in your family may not have them but we assure you that this is a common feature with all males. Regard it as a manifestation of your manly and masculine gender. There is no need to feel awkward and embarrassed about having the hair. You are probably experiencing this feeling of uneasiness because it is something new to you. Think positively, consider it a phase of life, the body is undergoing a rapid transformation and sooner or later you will overcome this, Insha Allah.\n\nConclusively, we state that it would be inappropriate for you to intentionally tamper and remove your hair whether via waxing, shaving, etc.\n\nOn the same note, it is extremely joyous to notice your new commitment to Deen by performing your five daily salahs. May Allah Ta’ala keep you steadfast on performing these and may He grant us all the sweetness of Imaan whereby we may understand every situation to be from Allah and where pleasing Him becomes our goal and means of pleasure.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n\nDārul Iftāa"
