  "answer": "QUESTION\nI work in a karge corporate company and constantly in contact with investors and many other types of people.Can I brush my teeth with toothpaste during ramadaan so as to avoid bad breath?I have used a miswaak ,the teeth get clean but the breath is not freshened.Shukran\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNo, you may not use toothpaste to brush your teeth during Ramadhaan. It is Makrooh to do so.\n\nIf toothpaste is swallowed, the fast is nullified. If you feel your breath will be offensive to other people, avoid coming into very close contact with them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
