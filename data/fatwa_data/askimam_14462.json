  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI was wondering if it is haram to refuse medical treatment for an illness.\n\nFor example, if I am diagnosed with an illness that could be controlled with medicine, would it be a sin not to take the medicine? Would this count as being suicidal?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe rulings of the Shari’ah have been pronounced by Allah with the aim of protecting and maintaining certain fundamental aspects. Amongst them are life, wealth, dignity and honour, sanity, etc. If these are compromised, Shari’ah has allowed and advocated drastic measures to be adopted for their protection and restoration. Example: If a person risks losing his wealth (due to theft, etc.), he is permitted to kill. If a chaste woman is falsely accused of indecency, the offender will be lashed, etc.\n\nSimilarly, with regards to life, many laws of the Shari’ah have been continued for its protection. Life and the body which is a vessel transporting the soul, are the soul property of Allah. As the creation of Allah, we act in the capacity of trustees with regard to these trusts. For the protection of this life, Islam has afforded great flexibility. Carrion, pork, blood, etc. which are impure and therefore impermissible under normal circumstances, have not only been made permissible but are compulsory for a person to consume if there remains no other means of survival. (Raddul Muhtar vol.2 pg.134; HM Saeed).\n\nSuch rulings are indicative of the value of life in the light of the Shari’ah. Therefore, if the consumption of items which are frowned upon and shunned has been compulsory for the protection of life, then surely no scope whatsoever remains to abstain from medical treatment, which is a Sunnah of our Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], if the end result is the loss of life.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
