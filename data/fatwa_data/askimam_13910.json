You may assist in fixing the army equipment and defusing explosives. However, it will not be permissible to assist if the army attacks innocent people oppressively and unjustly whether they are Muslims or non Muslims. Shariah prohibits oppression. Allah Taa’la states in Hadith e Qudsi \"I have made Zulm (oppression) unlawful upon myself and you, therefore do not oppress\". (Mishkaat)\n\nAssisting in maintaining peace and stability is permissible and a virtuous and meritorious act.\n\nWe do not know what is Ouija Boards. Kindly inform us what is it.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
