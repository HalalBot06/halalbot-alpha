  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have been in contact with a boy through emails only sometimes for school work. I did Istikhara about whether to be friends with him or not because he is a boy. I prayed two Rakats of Istikhara and read the dua of Istikhara. When I slept I had a dream that he is typing a message to me then everything is becoming green (as grass,and trees growing) and when I am reading his email everywhere there is grass, flowers and trees growing and my mom is also with me and she can also see them. Then the second time i did Istikhara I saw that my dad is telling me to go somewhere but I need someone to go with me and then my dad tells me to go with him and I go with him. Please interpret my dreams of Istikhara.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Haraam (strictly prohibited) for you to have any contact whatsoever.\nAny unnecessary communication with the boy will be regarded as Zina\n(adultery).\n\nThat dream is a whisper of the Shaytaan. It is not appropriate to consider\nhaving a friendship with the boy or even to make Istikhaara for that.\nIstikhaara is not made to perform any Haraam act.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
