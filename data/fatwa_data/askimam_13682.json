  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI want to know the details about \"Names of Hazarat Muhammad (P.B.U.H)\" and their authenticity\n\n2. \"Prawns\" are hallal in hanfi school of thought ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] had many names. Some have enumerated 99. Allaamah Sakhawi [ra] in Qawlul Badee has listed more than 400 names. However, many of them are not actual names, but rather qualities of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. Nevertheless, they are derived from Qur’aan, Hadith, previously revealed books and incidents which took place in the life of Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam].\n\n2. According to the Hanafis, anything which categorized as fish is Halaal. According to some Ulama, prawns do fall under the category of fish whilst others say it doesn’t. It is, therefore, preferable to refrain from consuming prawns.\n\nand  Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
