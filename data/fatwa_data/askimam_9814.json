  "question": "What should a man do if he receives a 9ct gold plated watch as a gift?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu. I'm a male and I received a 9ct gold plated watch worth R800 as a birthday gift from a Hindu friend. In Islam, gold is haraam for men. What should I do with the gift? Jazaakallah Was Salamu Alaykum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuhu\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSince the content of the base metal in 9ct jewellery is dominant, all 9ct jewellery is not regarded as gold. Hence, a man may wear a 9ct gold watch. However, it is not advisable. You may sell it up and use the proceeds for personal use.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
