Why is this not a bidah? b) I heard from a very prominent mufti that Ahmed Deedat is a Mirzai and Munkireen-e-Hadith, is this true? the mufti is famous in whole of karachi c) is 'loud collective zikr' allowed in any circumstances in a Masjid?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. To have programmes on these specific days are not proven through any\nDalaail-e-Shari'ah (proof of Shari'ah) and nor were they found at the time\nof Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). However, to have such programmes on\nthese specific days will only be permissible, if; a) It is not regarded as\nnecessary, b) If anybody decides not to participate, he is not reprimanded\nor looked down upon, and c) The attaining of reward for giving and listening\nto Bayaans is not restricted to these days only.\nIf any of the above conditions are not fulfilled, then it will be regarded\nas Bid'at.
