  "question": "If an elder gives a younger Muslim a ruling, is it permissible to askfor the evidence for such. Or is this a matter of disrespect?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRulings of Shari'ah should be obtained from Allah-fearing and competent\nUlama. If the younger referred to is a student of Deen, he may request for\nShar'ee evidence of the rulings with the intention of increasing his\nknowledge.\n\nIf the younger referred to is not a student of Deen, requesting Shar'ee\nevidence will not serve him any purpose.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
