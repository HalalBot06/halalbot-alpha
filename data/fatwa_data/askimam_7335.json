  "question": "1). If a woman starts her menses after she has prayed fajr salah and she has to wait the full 10 ten days",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1). If a woman starts her menses after she has prayed fajr salah and she has to wait the full 10 ten days and nights until she can resume praying and fasting, will the 10 days and nights be complete AFTER the fajr salah of the 10th day or does she make ghusl BEFORE fajr salah and prays fajr as this is the beginning of the 11th day? 2). If a woman has a miscarriage, after how many weeks of pregnancy will her bleeding be considered post natal bleeding? The bleeding could be considered as Istihadah or menses, so how many weeks pregnant must a woman be for the bleeding from her miscarriage to be considered as any of the above 3 types of bleeding? 3). Muhammad (saw) informed us that the aborted child of a miscarriage will draw it?s mother to Paradise provided she seeks her reward from Allah (swt) (Mishkat). Is this true for a miscarriage that takes place early on, before the soul is placed in child (120th day) and any limbs have formed? Are they also in Paradise being taken care of by the Angels, or is it only those who have a soul that are in Paradise? 4). What is the manner in which one should dispose of the miscarried remains of a fetus that is still like a clump of blood without any distinguishable limbs? When praying lots of short surahs together in one rakah does each surah have to be separated by saying bismillah and what can u recite to lengthen rukuh and sujood? May Allah (swt) grant you jannat ul firdaws for your help. Ameen.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The ten days and nights will be calculated as 240 hours. Hence, if she is still bleeding before the Fajr of the 10th day, she is still in Haydh. Her Haydh only terminates at Fajr time. At Fajr time, she will take a bath and perform Salaat. This day will not be counted as a fast although she is required to abstain from food, etc. for the rest of the day.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. When any part of the miscarried foetus has already formed, the fingers for instance, the bleeding thereafter will be considered as Nifaas (post natal bleeding). If nothing has formed and the foetus looks like a mere piece of flesh, her bleeding will be regarded as Haydh (menses) if 15 days or more have passed since her last period or it will be considered as Istihaadha if less than 15 days have passed.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. The word in the Hadith is ?Siqt? which literally translates as a miscarriage. The word has no indication that the miscarriage is confined to a foetus with a soul.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. If it is like a pice of flesh or blood, it should be buried.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. It is better to recite Bismillah between each Surah.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. You may increase the number of the Tasbeehaat to lengthen the Rukoo?aat Sajdah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Kadwa%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
