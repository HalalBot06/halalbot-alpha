  "question": "Wouldn't it make more sense for Muslims to believe in the Second Coming of Muhammad?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI understand that Muslims believe in the Second Coming.....of Jesus!!! (Quran 19:33)\n\nWouldn't it make more sense for Muslims to believe in the Second Coming of Muhammad?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nIt does not make more sense.\n\nMuslims believe that Muhammad (SAW) passed away whilst Jesus (AS) was physically raised to the heavens and he will return to this world before the advent of the last day.\n\nSo what exactly is the thrust of your question?\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nDarul Iftaa"
