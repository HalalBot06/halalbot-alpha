  "answer": "QUESTION\nI wanted to know if we can talk to gair mahram regarding deen.Whenever I am working on computer.I get some chat messages from guys asking me to chat with them.I often ignore them saying that I don?t talk to strangers as I strictly follow the rules of parda.Then I also explain to them the importance of it.1)Is this haraam too? If so, how can we explain the importance of doing parda in Islam? 2) Is it advisable to explain to our cousins about parda as no one in the family observes it. 3) can we receive the telephone of a gair mehram?Please explain in detail. Jazakallah khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is narrated from Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) that a man and woman do not seclude themselves except Shaytaan interferes with them, i.e. by causing them to do Haraam. So, even though you have noble intention it is possible that Shaytaan can put evil thoughts in your heart. If anyone sends you a chat message, you should reply and say it is not permissible for me to chat with you or you should simply ignore it.\n\n2. Male cousins are also Ghayr-Mahrams. So, it will not permissible to speak to them. Rather, if none in the family is observing Purdah, you could obtain Kitaabs explaining the importance of Purdah and hand it out to them.\n\n3. It will not be permissible to receive calls from Ghayr Mahram except in necessity.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
