He(SAW) preferred to sit with those acquiring knowledge....\n\n2) ...any person who starts a good practice which is NOT Haraam and others follow. Then this person will get a reward for each person following that good practice...\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n1) عن عبد الله بن عمرو : ان رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم مر بمجلسين في مسجده فقال كلاهما على خير وأحدهما أفضل من صاحبه أما هؤلاء فيدعون الله ويرغبون إليه فإن شاء أعطاهم وان شاء منعهم واما هؤلاء فيتعلمون الفقه والعلم ويعلمون الجاهل فهم أفضل وإنما بعثت معلما قال ثم جلس فيهم (سنن الدارمي ج1 ص111, قديمي )\n\nAbdullah ibn Amr (رضي الله عنه ) narrates: once the Prophet ((صلي الله عليه وسلم)) passed by two groups of people in his Musjid. He said “Both of them are upon good, however, one is more virtuous than the other. As for them (the 1st group), they are supplicating to him and are inclined towards him. If he wishes he will give them and if he wishes he can withhold it from them. As for them (the 2nd group), they are learning Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and knowledge and educating the ignorant, they are more virtuous. Verily, I have been sent as a tutor” The narrator said: He then sat amongst them (i.e. the 2nd group).\n(Sunan Ad-Daarimi vol.1 pg 111, Qadeemi)\n\n \n\n2) قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم من سن في الإسلام سنة حسنة فله أجرها وأجر من عمل بها بعده من غير أن ينقص من أجورهم شيء ومن سن في الإسلام سنة سيئة كان عليه وزرها ووزر من عمل بها من بعده من غير أن ينقص من أوزارهم شيء\n(صحيح مسلم ج1 ص327-ج2 ص341,رشيدية)\n\nRasulullah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) has said: “whoever initiates a good practice in Islam, he will receive the reward (of the action) and the reward of those who practise on it after him without their reward decreasing in any way. Whoever initiates an evil practice in Islam, he will receive the burden (of his action) and the burden of those who practise on it after him without their burden decreasing in any way.\n(Sahih Muslim vol.1 pg 327- vol.2 pg 341, Rashidiyyah)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
