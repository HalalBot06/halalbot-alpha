  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it okay to send ZAKAT'ul Ma'al to Pakistani Earthquaqe victims?(Either Through Muslim Organizations and/or through individual Muslims).\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn principle, a recipient of Zakaat is a poor and needy Muslim. He does not have any surplus equivalent to the minimum Zakaat Nisaab. Generally, that is the condition of the earthquake victims and it is permissible to give them Zakaat funds.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
