  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. I am living in Saudi Arabia, i was born in Lahore, Pakistan. Whenever i go on vacation should i have to offer Qasar if my stay at home is less than 15 days, please also specify the distance for Qasr namaz. Should i have to offer Qasr in my in-laws house (it is a different city not Lahore).\n\n2. Which Ayat in Quran shows the method of doing Wuddu (ablution) and method of performing Namaz, please give reference.\n\n3. What is \"Qayas\"  , please explian with some example.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n1)      If you have permanently moved to Saudi Arabia and have made it your home, then you will be a musafir in Pakistan. The distance of safar after which qasr salah can be offered is 78 km. If your stay is less than 15 days in one city, then you will make qasr salah. For example, if you stay less than 15 days in Lahore, then travel to another city which is 78 km or more away and stay less than 15 days there, then qasr will be offered in both places. If you stay 15 days or more in any of the cities, then you will have to offer full salah.\n\n \n\nوأما مدة الإقامة فأقلها خمسة عشر يوما عندنا\n\n(Baddai’ us-Sanaai’, 1/269, Deoband)\n\n \n\n2)      Allah Ta’ala says in the Holy Quran regarding wudu:\n\n \n\nيا أيها الذين آمنوا إذا قمتم إلى الصلاة فاغسلوا وجوهكم وأيديكم إلى المرافق وامسحوا برءوسكم وأرجلكم إلى الكعبين\n\n“O believers! When you rise for prayer wash your faces and your hands up to your elbows, and make mash of your heads and (wash) your feet up to the ankles” (5:6)\n\n \n\nThe Quran has explained the faraaidh of wudu while the details (such as how many times to wash, etc.) are found in various Ahaadith.\n\n \n\nAs for the method of performing salah, the Holy Quran simply orders us to establish salah in many verses. However, the details and methods on how to perform the salah can be found in the many Ahaadith of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) pertaining to salah. It is important for one to remember that the Holy Quran was sent as a general guide to mankind. Allah Ta’ala sent a Messenger in Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) to explain the injunctions of the Holy Quran and to describe the proper methods of performing salah, paying zakah, etc. Had the Quran described everything fully in detail for mankind, then why would there be a need for a messenger?\n\n \n\n3)      The meaning of qiyas is a method of deriving a hukm which is not mentioned in the Quran, Hadith, and ijma’. It is taking an established ruling from Shari’ah and applying it to a new case, in virtue of the fact that the new case shares the same essential reason for which the original ruling was applied.\n\n \n\nA simple example of qiyas is the ruling of all intoxicants being haraam. In the Holy Quran, Allah Ta’ala orders us to abstain from khamar (wine, alcoholic drinks). So it would obviously appear that the reason for the prohibition is because of the intoxicating effect. Therefore, although not particularly mentioned in the Quran and Hadith, all other things which have an intoxicating effect (such as drugs etc.) will be deemed haraam as well due to the verse which prohibits khamar.\n\n \n\n(Tasheel Usul-ul-Shashi, P. 168, Idaratul Quran)  \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
