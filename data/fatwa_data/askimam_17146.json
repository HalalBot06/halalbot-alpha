  "question": "Can i pay his funeral costs with Zakaat money?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ncan i pay for someone's funeral out of zakat money i intended to give them after eid. He passed away during the time i intended to pay him and the date i was going to pay him. He is abroad and his wife/daughter can not pay the large amount. He was entitled to receive zakat when he was alive.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt will not be permissible to give one’s zakāh to a deceased person. Making a living person the owner of the wealth and giving over to his or her possession is a condition of zakāh. A permissible alternative would be to discharge your zakāh to one of the poor and needy family members of the deceased who will then use that money for the funeral expenses.\n\nإذَا أَرَادَ أَنْ يُكَفِّنَ مَيِّتًا عَنْ زَكَاةِ مَالِهِ لَا يَجُوزُ ( وَالْحِيلَةُ فِيهِ أَنْ يَتَصَدَّقَ بِهَا عَلَى فَقِيرٍ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْمَيِّتِ ) ، ثُمَّ هُوَ يُكَفِّنُ بِهِ الْمَيِّتَ فَيَكُونُ لَهُ ثَوَابُ الصَّدَقَةِ وَلِأَهْلِ الْمَيِّتِ ثَوَابُ التَّكْفِينِ (الفتاوى الهندية ج 6 ص 392 ، مكتبة رشيدية)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
