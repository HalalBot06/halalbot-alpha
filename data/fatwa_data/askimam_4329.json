  "question": "My husband told me \"I divorce you\" on three separate occasions, without witnesses,however he denies it. Am I divorced?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have since left him but he wants me back. I don't intend to go back. What should I do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf your husband told you on three separate occasions, \"I divorce you\" then\nthat is a permanently irrevocable divorce. Your marriage to him has\npermanently terminated and you cannot return to him as a wife until\nHalaalah. Halaalah is a process of a divorcee marrying another person after\nIddat and consummation, if the second husband voluntarily divorces her, then\nshe may marry her former husband after her Iddat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
