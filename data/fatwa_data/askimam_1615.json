  "question": "Halal meat in Qur'an and Hadith",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Does Surah 5, Al Maidah verse 5 over ride the Al-Anam, Surah 6, verse 118-121 just because Al Maidah was revealed after Al-Anam? This is the argument used by the people who say eating USDA meat is OK. 2. The example of Aishah (raw) accepting meat from Christians and getting permission to eat it from the Prophet (pbuh) is used. 3. What is the difference between \"Halal\" and \"Zabihah\" meat?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, Ta'aarudhaat (apparent inconsistencies) are dealth within the\nfollowing sequence; a) Tadbeeq (reconciliation); b) Tarjeeh (Preference); c)\nNaskh (abrogation)\n\nFurthermore, the fundamental principle of understanding the Qur'aan is one\nAayat of the Qur'aan explains the other. (AlFawzul Kabir). Therefore,\naccording to the principles of Ta'arudhaat and the fundamental principle of\nTafseer, it is possible to make Tadbeeq of the Aayats of both Surahs,\nal-Maaidah and al-Inaam, as explained in our previous answer. There is no\nneed to resort to Tarjeeh and Naskh.\n\nThe argument presented by the people is unprincipled. In the presence of an\nexpress order from the Qur'aan, the Hadith (even if proven correct) will be\nexpain contextually and circumstantially.\n\nZabah is the Islamic procedure of making the meat Halaal.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n</"
