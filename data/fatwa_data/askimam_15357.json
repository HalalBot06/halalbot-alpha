Is it allowed for me to sit with them , and if it is not how can I still go and visit my family , i love them and i need to spend time with them .\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nShariah encourages one to maintain a good relationship with ones parents even though they are non Muslims. You should visit them and always strive to keep them happy. Furthermore, your good relation towards them will also serve as a Dawah and invitation to Islam. However, in maintaining a good relation with ones parents, one should also take into consideration the teachings of Islam and Deen.\n\nYou may join them for the meal on condition you observe the laws of Hijaab (if there are any strangers), there is no music and the food is Halaal. If you are doubtful with regards to the food being Halaal, you may eat vegetables or seafood.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
