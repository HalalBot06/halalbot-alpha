In principle, Ghayr Mahrams must observe Hijaab from one another. It is Haraam (strictly prohibited) to even see one another, let aside talking, talking and kissing. These are all major sins.\n\nYou should immediately adhere to the law of Shari?ah as expressly mentioned in the Qur?aan and observe Hijaab from your cousin sister. If you love her and only living for her, you should consider marrying her and make your relationship with her lawful in Shari?ah.\n\nWe also advise you consult your seniors before deciding.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
