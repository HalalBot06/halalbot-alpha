  "question": "are men allowed to wear shorts?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a member of a sports club, which plays indoor games in a gymnasium. Only men are members of this club and hence only men play in the gymnasium at any given time. In this circumstance am I allowed to wear shorts during the course of my play?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, the Satar for males (those parts of the body\nwhich must be covered) is from the navel uptil the knees, excluding the\nnavel itself and including the knees. (Bahrur raaiq vol.8 pg.192)\n\nThis means that it is not permissible for a man to expose his knees or\nthighs or to look at the knees or thighs or to look at the knees or thighs\nof another male. In such circumstances, it will be permissible to wear such\nshorts which hang below and comfortably cover the knees.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
