  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) Is there any particular dua to recite to prevent vomitings during pregnancy ?\n2) My friend lives in the US and has the problem of finding good zabiha meat. Basically there are three types of meat available, one  about which it is confirmed that is zabiha, the other which it is confirmed it is non-zabiha and the third one it is not known for sure whether it is zabiha or not. The zabiha meat available is usually not of good quality and he has to thrown it  away more than once. Some scholar there said that although it is better is to eat zabiha meat but non-zabiha meat could also be consumed. What should he do ? Currently he is eating chicken and fish until this confusion is resolved, please help.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1) Surah Yaseen\n\nIt is reported in a Hadith, \"Whoever reads Surah Yaseen, is forgiven; whoever reads it in hunger, is satisfied; whoever reads it having lost his way, finds the way; whoever reads it on losing an animal finds the same. And when one reads it apprehending that his food will run short, the food becomes sufficient. And if one reads it beside a person who is in the throes of death, the same are made easy for him. And if anyone reads it on a woman experiencing difficulty in child-birth, her delivery becomes easy.\"\n\n \n\n2) Non Zabeeha meat may not be consumed. Allah Ta’ala states in the noble Quran:\n\n \n\n- ‘For every nation We have specified a rite (for slaughtering) so that they may take the name of Allah Ta’ala upon (the slaughter of) the animals granted to them as sustenance.’ (Hajj 34)\n\n \n\n- And consume not of that whereupon the name of Allah Ta’ala was omitted (at the time of salughter). Indeed it is a transgression. Verily the Shayaateen inspire their friends to cause division with you. If you obey them, you are indeed Mushriks (ascribing partners to Allah).’ (An’aam 122)\n\n \n\n- Forbidden to you are carrion, flowing blood, the flesh of swine and that slaughtered for other than Allah as well as the (animal) expiring by strangulation, illness or pain, falling (from a height), by a wound (sustained through fighting) and by falling to a predator and (about to be consumed),excepting those (animals) upon which you effect Zaka (Shar’ee slaughter). (Maaidah 3)\n\n \n\nFrom the above Aayaat, we understand:\n\n \n\nThe most important condition is that Tasmiyah (taking the name of Allah) be pronounced at the same time of slaughter. The Aayaats clearly explain the impermissibility of those animals whose slaughter was not preceded by Tasmiya.\n\n \n\n- The ayats clearly explain the impermissibility of those animals whose lives were ended by means other than Zabah (Shar’ee slaughter) of which Tasmiyah is a condition. All such animals are Maytah (carrion) and are expressly forbidden.\n\n \n\n- The Dhabeeha (animal slaughtered) by a Kafir or a Mushrik is Haraam. However, those Ahlul Kitaab (people of the book) who also hold the Aqeedah (belief) of Tasmiya at the time of slaughter have been excluded from the Kuffar majority.\n\n \n\nAlmighty Allah Ta’ala in His infinite mercy has made certain animals Halaal (permissible) for this Ummah. We are required to be thankful to Him by following the dictates of the Quran and Sunnah by ensuring that His name is taken upon slaughtering of the animal.\n\nFind attached 'Zabeeha of Ahlul Kitaab'.\n\n \n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
