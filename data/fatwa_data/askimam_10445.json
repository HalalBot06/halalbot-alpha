  "answer": "QUESTION\n7 years back , i could not tolerate it, i tried to stop him and make him understand, but he still tried his advances on me, for which i had to kick him out of my room, after which i never ever allowed him to come to my room, and i broke friendship with him, so as to save my imaan, was i right in doing so? now i am going for hajj, shall i talk to him for apology, cause i was rude to the maximum when i kicked him out of my room? i cut my friendship with him after that, is it right on my part being a momin?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for writing to the institute regarding your unfortunate experience.\n\nAs you say, you tried to make him understand that his approaches were not welcome and unacceptable. You did right in throwing him out of your room. If one has tried the reasonable and pleasant approach and if it fails, it does become necessary to assert oneself more forcefully, especially when it concerns one's Imaan.\n\nIt was not necessary to cut off your relationship completely. By that I mean that you could have limited yourself to make salaam and ask about his wellbeing. Yes, do go and greet him and ask him to forgive you and to remember you in his duas. Do this sincerely, for the pleasure of Allah Ta'ala. In fact you should also make lots of dua for him so that Allah Ta'ala grants him hidayah and that he is steeered away from his present inclinations.Ameen.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best.\n\n1Social Department\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
