  "question": "How much of the Quran should I read daily to not be of the neglectful?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHadhrat Abdullah ibn Mas?ood [Radhiallaahu anhu] that Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] mentioned, ?He who recites one Harf (letter) of the Qur?aan, he will receive one reward and one will be multiplied ten fold.? He further mentioned, ?I am not saying Alif-laam-meem is one letter, but alif is one letter, laam is one letter and maam is one letter.? (Tirmidhi)%0D%0A%0D%0AThis means that only for the recitation of Alif-laam-meem, one will get thirty rewards, and if one recites ?alhamd? he will get fifty rewards because it consists of five letters.%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the above narration, we learn the more Qur?aan recited by an individual, the more rewards one will attain. It was the practise of the Sahaaba [Radhiallahu anhum] that they used to complete one Qur?aan every week. For this, they have distributed the Qur?aan into seven parts which is known as Manzils or Ahzaab.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the first century, the Qur?aan was distributed in Akhmaas and A?shaar.%0D%0AAkhmaas ? after every five Aayaat on the side of the Qur?aan ?kh? was written.%0D%0AA?shaar ? after every ten Aayaat on the side of the Qur?aan ?ashr? was written.%0D%0A%0D%0AAfter a while, these signs were done away with and the Qur?aan was then distributed according to its subjects, composition and stories, etc. The distribution is called Rukus and on the side of the Qur?aan to signify a Ruku an ?ayn? is written. The idea of this distribution was so that the Qur?aan be distributed in a very moderate amount so that one may recite that amount in one Rakaat of Salaat. It is for this reason it is called Ruku because it is here where a person will go into Ruku. In the entire Qur?aan, there are 540 Rukus.%0D%0A%0D%0AThere is no specific amount for one to recite daily. However, one should remember ? the more he recites, the more reward he will attain.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Imaam Abu Hanifa [ra] has mentioned, ?It is the right of the Qur?aan, then we at least complete it twice every year. Once in the month of Ramadhaan and once in the remaining months of the year.?%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AQari Ismail Abdul-Aziz%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN QUR?AANIC SCIENCES AND RECITATIONS%0D%0A%0D%0Achecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
