  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is the purpose of giving Mahr to the bride? And what is an appropriate amount? Is it better to give what can be afforded, rather than making a promise to give something which you may not be able to fulfill (some people say they will give \"X\" amount of dollars, but take like 7-10 years to give it) What is the sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH)? Also, can you have the nikkah and valima both on the same day? ie: have one gathering? Is it permissible for men to wear Platinum? In regards to prayer, some people say it is permissible to pray sitting in a car on the road, rather than making your salah Kazaa, is this correct? Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Kindly refer attached\n2. Consummation of the marriage is not a pre-requisite for the validity of\nWalima. However, the Sunnah practise is to have the Walimah after\nconsummation. - refer attached\n3. It is not permissible for males to wear platinum.\n4. If a person is in a car and he is unable to come out and perform Salat\n(after exhausting every possible effort to do so), he may perform Salat\nwhile sitting in the motor vehicle and repeat the Salat thereafter.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
