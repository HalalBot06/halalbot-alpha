  "question": "Is it true that a father gets total custody of a son when the boy is seven years if the marriage ends in divorce?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am looking for an answer under Islamic law.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs a general rule, when a divorce takes place the right of custody in the\ncase of minor children is awarded to the mother first if she does not\nremarry. This is effective in the case of a male upto the age of seven and\nin the case of a female upto the age of nine. If she remarries then her\nright of custody is thereafter passed on to her mother, children's maternal\ngrandmother.\n\nAfter the respective ages of seven and nine, the father has the right of\ncustody. However, both parents have visitation rights when the children are\nnot in his/her custody. Visitation rights should be mutually agreed. Apart\nfrom the general rule, the overwhelming advantage of the children also plays\nan integral part in determining the rights of custody. Somewhere on this\nsite, search 'custody' (without quotes)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
