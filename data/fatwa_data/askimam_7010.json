  "question": "could we (Muslims) talk about “luck”, like saying to a person “you are lucky” or do we just have to say “It’s your Maktoub” ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. Can u please tell me if there?s a difference between ?El Kada? wal Kadar? and ?El Maktoub? and what is it ? (the difference) ?.. 2. Also could we (Muslims) talk about ?luck?, like saying to a person ?you are lucky? or do we just have to say ?It?s your Maktoub? ? 3.Is it alright if I say something like ?I don?t believe in luck but I believe in Maktoub?? 4. Could you also please tell me where in the Coran the word ?luck? is cited and does it have the same meaning as the word itself said daily in a Muslim or non Muslim World ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. These are different terminologies representing the same thing ? fate.\n\n2. You may use the word lucky in the context of fortunate.\n\n3. The statement, ?I don?t believe in luck but in Maktoub? is correct in the sense that nothing happens without the will of Allah. Everything is subject to His predestined wish.\n\n4. The Qur?aan uses the word Sa?eed at various junctures. It means a person who is fortunate. Hence, the word lucky and fortunate may be used.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
