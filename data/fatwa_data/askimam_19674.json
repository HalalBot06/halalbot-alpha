  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMalfooz: The benefit of the book: Mahaasine Islam\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nHazrat mentioned that he was once travelling with a friend by train. There was a learned Hindu and his friend in their car. After a while, the Hindu person’s friend departed at a station. There were only three of us left. The Hindu looked at Mahaasine Islam and inquired as to what the book was all about. He then took the book and started reading it. While he was reading, he stopped at one point and said Subhanallah. I don’t know what statement of the article caused him to say Subhanallah. The point being that Haq has an effect on all people whether they are Muslims or not.\n\n \n\nMahaasine Islam was written to deter people from leaving Islam. I personally know of a group of people who intended to leave Islam but Alhamdulillah after reading Mahaasine Islam, they remained steadfast on Islam."
