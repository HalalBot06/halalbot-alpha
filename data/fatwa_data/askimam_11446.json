  "question": "In light of the new movie on the life of Jesus (Hazrath Essa A.S.), could you please clarify what really happend at the crucifiction and who was responsible?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe are unable to answer your question based on the recent movie on the life of Eesa (Jesus) [alayhis salaam] as seeing movies is Haraam.\n\nNevertheless, the Christian version of the crucifiction of Eesa [alayhis salaam] is incorrect as already stated in the Qur'aan. Allah Ta'ala states, 'And they did not kill him (Eesa - alayhis salaam) nor did they hang him, but they were put in doubt.' Anything about the crucifiction of Eesa [alayhis salaam] from the Christians is nothing but an expression of that doubt.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
