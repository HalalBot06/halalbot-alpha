  "question": "Does switching off a cellphone while in Salaat invalidate the Salaat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nCellphones should be switched off before Salaat. If a person forgets to\ndo so and the phone rings while in Salaat then it should be switched off by\nengaging just one hand. The use of two hands will invalidate the Salaat.\n(Raddul Mukhtar vol.1 Pg.625; H.M. Saeed)\n\nFrom Al Mahmood 10"
