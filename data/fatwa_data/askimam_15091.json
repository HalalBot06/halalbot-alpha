  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am working for a company who has a contract with some other company. Normal working hours per day are 8. My job is the database administrator. Most of the time, this is monitoring job. I have to look if all the systems are up and running. If there is some problem fix it and so on. I have question regarding the working time. It sometime happens that you are 10-15 minute late or you leave early 20-30 minutes early. Supervisor does not mind that. Is this allowed as I fill the time sheet stating full working hours and signed by supervisor. What Should I do? Should I compensate that time sitting extra time in office while on one is there.\n\nSecond, Sometimes I go for Umrah. In office saudis have weekly two days off, while contractors only one day. When I have to go for umrah, I need extra 1 full day (thu, where in office only 10% people are on duty) and 2 hrs off on Wed. My superviser allows me to fill the full timesheet (which later goes to my company for invoicing), meaning that I was present in office. Is this allowed? What is way out that I can perform umrah also don't earn haram also. Needless to say, I have to fill the full timesheet otherwise, it is a problem as why I was absent? Why my company did not send replacement and etc...\n\nPlease guide me in both the above situations. Also what is the remedy of the past time which I have been paid full.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf you were not in office for the full duration of your work, it will be incorrect to fill in the sheet to create an impression that you fulfilled your full time. You should discuss this with your supervisor. If the company overlooks such absenteism and leaves that to the discretion of the supervisor, then if the supervisor has the rights to permit you to fill in the attendance chart as full attendance, then there is a leeway as that is an administrative issue.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
