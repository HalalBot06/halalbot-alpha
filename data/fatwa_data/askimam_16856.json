  "question": "I want to know that do I really not allowed to see her face while we meet somewhere in the context of Islam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI fall in love with a girl (Age 17), who also loves me very much. We both are Muslim. She is so much Islamic religious. We respect each other so much, and we do not want to do anything which is not acceptable in the eyes of Islam. We first met in the internet chat room, and our relationship has grown up only 1 month so far. The fact is, we did not meet each other in person yet. But I want to meet and see her face. She also agreed with me to meet But she do not want to show her face due to so much Islamic minded.\n\nShe is telling me that the Islam does not allow showing a women’s face to other person (except some specific person in the family). It is count as a GUNAH in the eyes of Islam, she will never accept me to show her face without marry. I am so much frustrated after hearing that from her.\n\nNow I want to know that do I really not allowed to see her face while we meet somewhere in the context of Islam?\n\nHere I am giving you some points bellow about us for your better understanding for giving me your right answer in the rules and regulation of Islam, Kur’an & Hadis.\n\n\n·       She sent me her face photo through the internet mail. And telling me that the photo is an inactive object, it is not GUNAH to show.\n\n·       She is telling me: Prophet Mohammad (S) advised that women are not allowed to show her a single fur of her skin to the other person.\n\n·       I am not her relative from any blood.\n\n\nCAN I SEE HER FACE WHILE WE MEET???\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAt the outset, we wish to point out that internet chatting with the opposite gender is haram. The reason for the prohibition is it leads to zina. This is also clear from your chatting with the girl. Had you not chatted with her, you would not have known her. The chatting has led your’ll to exchange photos. Now an arrangement is made to meet. What thereafter? Brother, chatting is haram. Exchanging photos is haram and meeting is also haram. All three sins fall in the category of zina. It is not only the showing of the face that is a sin. Both of you should fear Allah and terminate all contact for the pleasure of Allah and experience the sweetness of Ieman that will emanate from hurting the Nafs for the pleasure of Allah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
