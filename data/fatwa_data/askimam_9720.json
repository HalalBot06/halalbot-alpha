  "question": "How does an aalim earn his living? 2. What is the ruling concerning women keeping all their hairs naturally long and not cutting it, but only cutting the forelock",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nINSHALLAH I will be engaged to a haafiz/aalim. I am very pleased about this but worried also. I am worried that how will he earn money because I don't know how aalims earn money especially in Pakistan (I am in the U.S. now). And also is there an overabundance of aalims in Pakistan? Please help me feel not worried INSHALLAH. 2. What is the ruling concerning women keeping all their hairs naturally long and not cutting it, but only cutting the forelock (bangs) a little bit so it is on the face? The rest of the hairs will be long, only a little will be short by the face. I have no intention to imitate Kaafirs, but only to make my hair look nice and not show to non-mehrams.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Those Ulama that are wealthy, for example, coming from affluent families earn their income from their family businesses. They serve the Deen of Allah on a gratis basis to earn the pleasure of Allah. Not all Ulama are privileged with that gift and do not have the financial support of their families. Many such Ulama adopt their own means of income and also serve the Deen of Allah on gratis. They do not take any remuneration for their services. There are also those Ulama who do not have the means and the time to generate their own income as they are engrossed in serving the Deen of Allah. If they have to earn their own income, it would be difficult to serve Deen. Their spare time will not be sufficient to serve the many avenues of Deen. It is in the interest of the Deen of the community to fulfil the needs of such Ulama. They should contribute with the spirit of serving Deen and not in the spirit of paying the Ulama for their services. They should hold the Ulama in high esteem and appreciate their services. They are a means of preserving the Deen of Allah and the Imaan of people which is essential for their eternal salvation.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. It is not permissible for a female to trim her forelock. You may use a clip or pin to avoid the hair coming on your face.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
