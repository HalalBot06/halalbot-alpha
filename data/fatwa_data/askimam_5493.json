Give me your suggestion.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'One person getting guidance%0D%0Athrough you is better than red camels (being expensive and a luxury of that%0D%0Atime).'%0D%0A%0D%0AIn view of the above, if the Christian female gets Hidaayat through you, it%0D%0Ais highly commendable. However, marriage has major implications. It is not%0D%0Ajust being a means of guidance. It is two people staying together and%0D%0Asharing almost everything of theirs. Such a close relationship require%0D%0Acompatibility and understanding. While there are many men who married%0D%0AChristian women have successfully introduced them to Islam and live a%0D%0Acomfortable life, there are also many who experience major marital life%0D%0Aproblems due to non-compatibility. In the beginning, their intentions may%0D%0Ahave been noble but with continuous disputes, they begin resenting one%0D%0Aanother.%0D%0A%0D%0AMany such woman revert to Christianity and the sin of that is worse than not%0D%0Ainitially accepting Islam. It is, therefore, advisable that you exercise%0D%0Acaution and don't hasten in your decision. Mashura (consultation) with your%0D%0Aseniors is important. You should also make Istikhaara and continuously make%0D%0ADu'aa. Insha Allah, Allah will guide you towards whatever is best for you.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
