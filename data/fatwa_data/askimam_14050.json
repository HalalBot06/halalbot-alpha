  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan a Muslim man work under a female boss or take order from a female in a workplace?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are two aspects to the query; a) Females out of home and working, b) Dealing with females.\n\nAccording to the Shari’ah, a female’s place is her home. She could come out from her home only in case of need and necessity which is recognised and accepted in Shari’ah. In that instance, she will have to observe the laws of Hijaab and Purdah in Shari’ah. She cannot intermingle with the opposite gender or take with a Ghayr Mahram male without need and necessity. Ghayr Mahram is he with whom marriage is permissible. If she violates the laws of Hijaab, it will be a major sin.\n\nIt is permissible for a female to have a male employee. If the male is a Ghayr Mahram, then the laws of Hijaab must apply.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
