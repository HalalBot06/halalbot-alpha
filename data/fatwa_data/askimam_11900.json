Please help me in this matter asap, i will be thankful to you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, we wish to inform you that it is prohibited to have a premarital relationship. The concept of fiancé/fiancée is prohibited in Islam. Such a relationship falls in the category of Zina and adultery, which is a major sin. There are also many negative consequences to such an un-Islamic relationship.\n\nWe advise you terminate all contact with the girl. Inform her that you have received a Shar?ee ruling on the relationship and you wish to abide by that. If you are interested in marrying her, then consult your seniors and also make Istikhaara. The girl has been honest to you in inform you about her relationship with another person. You should be careful in making your choice of marriage and follow the guidance of Shari?ah as explained above.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
