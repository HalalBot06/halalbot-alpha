In fact, if he does so he will be rewarded for taking care of his parents and supporting them.\n\nIt is appropriate to marry when the girl reaches the age of puberty. However, it is important that the girl knows how to conduct herself with her husband and fellow members of society. A young girl generally starts learning the art of socialising at this age from her parents. This learning curve in the life of that young girl creates that mental maturity which is important when considering marriage. Many marriages break because one or both of the spouses are not mature enough to handle the challenges and demands of marriage.\n\nTherefore, if you are prepared to wait for two years then you may do so. Otherwise explain the need to marry to your parents and take their guidance on the issue.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
