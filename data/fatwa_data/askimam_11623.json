  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) The shocking pictures of Iraqi prisoners being abused is causing me distress. I keep thinking about them (which makes me feel sick) and have difficulty sleeping. I keep having thoughts of ?how can Allah (s.w.t.) allow this to happen? and thoughts of disbelief. I try to suppress these thoughts and think no, Allah (s.w.t) will surely punish these people, but I feel unhappy as I am not always successful. Sometimes the only way is to forget about it and not listen/watch the news, but this doesn?t feel right. What should I do? 2) I am a British born 24 year old of Bangladeshi origin. I get angry that Arabs in the Middle East appear to have no unity, they fight among themselves, they moan about the USA/Israel, yet do nothing constructive about it. Why don?t they build industry to be self sufficient I think? I feel bad about this, what should I do to stop these ill thoughts? 3) People in the USA (and the here in the UK) have a ?them and us? type attitude which makes them united together in their belief that they are right all the time, better than others and makes them strong, Arabs don?t. What can be done ? should Muslim adopt this attitude?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is only natural that the agony of our Muslim brothers would cause us distress. There is always wisdom in whatever Allah Ta?ala decrees for His creation. We just do not grasp the wisdom. Leave it up to Allah Ta?ala to take the perpetrators to task. Your job is to make Du?aa and to take lesson from the sufferings of the others.\n\n2. This is also a natural perception. You are entitled to feel this way. To some extent, they are at fault but responsibility is not to sit and criticise them. Make du?aa for them.\n\n3. The apparent unity you witness in those countries is not unity really. They perhaps have a common goal that unites them in purpose. Their hearts are disunited. Muslims supposed to be united in their goals and objectives. Yes, their means to attain this objective would obviously differ.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nchecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)\n<"
