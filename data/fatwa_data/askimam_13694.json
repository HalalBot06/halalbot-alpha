  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease provide me guidance as i am in a very tough situation. Some 2 years back i fell in love with one girl and i wanted to marry her but she was a hindu. Initiallly she was not ready because of religion, parents and her being not so beautiful as me. But i told her that i dont want too beautiful girl too, and i love only her. As time passed she too started falling in love with me but as she didnt want to go against her parents wish we thought that our marriage is not possible. In meantime she got engaged and her marriage date too stated approaching. But at the same time we were becoming closer day by day and just 2 days before marriage she broke up and almost pleaded me to get married. I told her that i cant guranttee her, her parents love, which even she understood and got married only for her parents sake. But just two days after her marriage she found that she made a bad choice by going ahead with marriage and then the girl told her husband about our relation and asked for a divource and she found she cant be someones else and cant give love to anyother person other than me. She didnt even allow her husband to come close to her. She asked me if i can marry her. Initially i said No but later on after considering about her life i told her yes. But when she told this thing to her parents they forced her in emotions to stick to her husband and give her 100% commitment. In meantime even i tried to stick to one decision of No as i was adviced by lot of people and even i didnt want to hurt everyone by this. But as time passed both husband and wife found that they are not able to commit themselves in this marriage and Now husband itself has said to the girl that he feels this marriage cant continue like this and he has made his decision of getting a divource as he found girl crying everyday and i everytime reject her offer to get married to her. Girl is now plaaning to stay alone if i dont get married to her. I feel i am responsible for all this as i made the girl to love me and now i am not ready to marry her because she made her decision to get married to someone else. As i am facing pressure from everyone not to give any type of hint to girl for marriage as she will try to get out of marriage but after yesturday her husband's decision i am on cross roads. I feel i can marry that girl as she is ready to do everything for me. She has even shown her interest to learn islam. I often find myself changing my decision. What can i do in this situation mufti saahab please guide me.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf the girl is divorced from her husband and she accepts Islam, you should marry her.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
