  "question": "1) i have a question. you have said on your website about regular zikr for people that one should do everyday:",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n100x durood, 100x astaghfirullah, 100x third kalimah, and if not not mistaken 100x first kalimah also. but i was listening to a bayaan of a shaikh. he said the following zikr any regular person can do (one who does not have bayt, i think he's called mureed), 100x first kalimah, 100x subhanallah, 100x durood sharif everyday. now i am confused as to which zikr to do. i always use to do the zikr on your website. but now after listening to the bayaan i am confused which one to do. please help. can i do anyone and stick to that one? can i continue with the one i have always been doing? 2) you have mentioned on your website that Surah Baqarah removes Shaitaan from the house in which it is read. so my question is should it be read everyday? if, what time of the day? should the whole entire surah be read as it is very long and hard to finish in one day? what dua should be made after reciting it, ex. oh Allah remove shaitain from our house?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. You may do any one of the two Dhikrs. You may also continue with the previous Dhikr.\n\n2. The recitation of Surah Baqarah has a special impact on removing the Shaytaan from the house. There is no specification of reciting Surah Baqarah everyday. One may recite Surah Baqarah as much as he/she can in the house. However, the removal of the Shaytaan from the house is not confined to the recitation of Surah Baqarah. The following acts also serve as deterrents against the Shaytaan.\n\na. To stay in the state of Tahaarah as much as possible\n\nb. To call out the Adhaan\n\nc. To perform Nafl Salaat in the house\n\nd. To say salaam aloud when entering the house\n\ne. To abstain from all sinful acts in the house\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
