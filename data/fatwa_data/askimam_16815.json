  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI just wanted to find out what is the position according to the Ahnaf, on Sea food, specifically, Lobster. I am comfortable with Taqleed, and further to that, the prohibiton by Imam Abu Hanifa Ra for seafood, apart from Fish. However i have read that some of the scholars has rated it as Makhruh, and have cautioned people on eating it because of the doubt, in it, and plus if we are followers of the Ahnaf, we should stick to this and not choose from the other Mazahib at our convenience. My question is, is it correct to say that Lobster is Haram, and is same as Pork, a Mufti from Pakistan is telling people that lobster is HARAM and is just as pork, is this JAIZ? Also we have a strictly halal Chinese Food place downhere, they have been certified halal by the darul Uloom of Trinidad, however they have recently started to sell Lobster, this Mufti has gone to this place and tell them that Lobster is Haram and they should not be selling this, is this correct, since this place is a public place, and hence people of the other Mazahib may eat there, even though they might be in the minority. I await your response.\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is true that according to the Hanafi mazhab, only fish from the sea is permissible. Lobster is not a fish, hence not permissible. A Hanafi should adhere to his mazhab.\n\nAccording to the other schools of thought, lobster is permissible. It is correct for the Chinese food outlet to sell lobsters even if the owners are Hanafi. Adherents of other mazhabs may purchase and consume the lobsters. The proceeds of the sale of lobsters for a Hanafi is permissible. It is incorrect to restrict the food outlet from selling lobsters.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
