  "question": "Should we take health and dental plan made mandatory by my university.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am sunni muslim (hanafi) new in North america. I am here as a student. Should we take health and dental plan made mandatory by my university. Back home in India, we were discouraged from having mediclaims and all. Is it allowed in Islam to take such plans called \"health and denal plans\". Under this the plan providers take one time annual fees and cover health and dental expenditures.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIn principle, conventional health plans do not conform to the rules of Shariah. However, if it is mandatory to take out a conventional health and dental plan, you will be excused.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
