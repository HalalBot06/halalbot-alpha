  "question": "Suffer badly from flatulance. Can namaaz be continued once wudu breaks in namaaz",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssaalamo-alaikum, I would appreciate if you would kindly obtain, from your learned colleagues an answer to my problem. I suffer terribly from flatulance and in Ramdaan it is particularly bad. I cannot keep wudu for 5 minutes. Is there a remedy that I could follow or could I read namaaz with wudu that has been made and repeated with bad flatulance. A response would be appreciated. Salaams\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour question is not clear. Our answer is according to our limited\nunderstanding. If our understanding is incorrect, then the answer will\ndiffer.\n\nZakaat must be given to the poor and needy. It is incorrect to purchase land\nand flats with Zakaat money. However, if it was done and the flat was given\naway to the poor and needy, then the Zakaat will be discharged.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
