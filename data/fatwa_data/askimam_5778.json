  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHistorians differ as to the birthday of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam). Many have preferred the view of it being 12 Rabi-ul-Awwal.%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) passed away on 12 Rabi-ul-Awwal.%0D%0AThis has been recorded in authentic narrations.%0D%0A%0D%0ADetermination of dates is not dependent on printed calendars. The Islamic%0D%0Acalendar is lunar. Thus, by the sighting of the moon all the people know%0D%0Athat it is the first of the month, and based on this can determine which is%0D%0Athe 12 of the lunar month.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Imraan Vawda%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0AQ: What is the correct view on the date of Rasulullah's (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) birth and demise?%0D%0AA: According to the majority opinion, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) was born in the month of Rabi-ul-Awwal, in the year of the%0D%0Aelephant. The day of his birth was Monday.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Qataadah (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was asked regarding the fast of Monday. He%0D%0Areplied, 'It is the day I was born and also the day when the first%0D%0Arevelation was sent upon me.' (Muslim vol1 pg.368; Deoband).%0D%0A%0D%0AThere are differences of opinion on the date of Rasulullah's (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) birth. Allaamah Kawthari (RA) prefers the 9th of%0D%0ARabi-ul-Awwal. (Maqaalaatul Kawthari pg.405 - 207). Allaamah Qastalaani (RA)%0D%0Astates that the majority of the Muhadditheen and historians have also%0D%0Apreferred the 9th of Rabi-ul-Awwal.%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) passed away in Rabiul-Awwal on a%0D%0AMonday. As regards the date of his demise, there are three opinions: 1, 2%0D%0Aand 12 Rabi-ul-Awwal (Bidaaya Wan Nihaaya vol.5 pg.275)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe 9th Dhul-Hijjah (day of Arafah) in the year 10AH (the year which%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) performed Hajj) was a Friday. If%0D%0Athe months Dhul-Hijjah, Muharram and Safar, all were 30 days, or 29 days or%0D%0Asome 29 and others 30 days, the 12th Rabi-ul-Awwal did not fall on a Monday.%0D%0ATherefore, the preferred view of the date of Rasulullah's demise is the 1st%0D%0Aor 2nd Rabi-ul-Awwal. Ibn Jarir (RA) prefers the 1st Rabi-ul-Awwal while Ibn%0D%0AHajar prefers the 2nd Rabi-ul-Awwal. (Al-Mawaahib with Zarqaani vol.1%0D%0Apg.131) - Al-Mahmood 15"
