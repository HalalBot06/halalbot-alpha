  "question": "What is the difference between Judgement day, the day of ressurection and Qayamat? And what EXACTLY will happen on them?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI would like to know the different between those three days and what exactly will happen on them? 2) Do you think this could be sign of Qayamat that Kaffirs are starting to take over, Afghanistan, gone. and still are trying to end Muslims.3) Do you think Arabs especially and other Muslims would try to prove themselves Muslims and try to save Muslims everywhere else? I mean ALLAH does that but it is our duty to prove us Muslims so do you think someone might try now? 4) you said people will be judged on judgement day and sent to wherever ALLAH wants them to go. So what about the people who already died, do they have to wait for Qayamat day?Wasalam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer below our standard reply to a similar query.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\n1. Frequent wars and domination of Kufr is a sign of Qiyaamat. However,\nafter Eesa (Alayhis salaam) kills Dajjaal, the entire world will be Muslims.\nThe mercy of Allah will descend on earth and there will be abundant\nblessings of Allah on earth.\n2. Every human being will be judged on the day of Qiyaamat (judgment day)\nand if a person is successful in the court of Allah, he will be granted\nentrance into Jannah. No human being will enter Jannah before the day of\njudgment.\n3. The day of resurrection refers to the day when every human being will be\ngiven life and raised from his/her grave to be judged in the court of Allah\nTa'ala - the day of judgment."
