  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni have recently started a business which also involves other non-muslims like hindus and christains.\n\nso i wanted to ask u whether it is right or wrong to do a business where other non-muslims are also involved.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is permissible for a Muslim to deal and do business with non-Muslims on condition the business itself is not un-Islamic and the Muslim is not required to do anything un-Islamic. An example of un-Islamic business is buying and selling intoxicants and an example of a Muslim engaged in an un-Islamic act is taking an interest bearing loan although the actual business may be Islamically acceptable.\n\nYou may forward us the details of the business you are engaged in with non-Muslims and we will comment on that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
