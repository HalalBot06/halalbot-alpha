  "question": "What does Islam say regarding medical aid voluntary and compulsary especially in the South African context?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nConventional medical aid schemes have elements of interest and gambling in\nthem, therefore, not permissible.\n\nIf a person is required to take out a medical aid scheme due to employment\nrules and principles, he will be excused to do so. However, he may use the\nbenefits of the medical aid scheme only to the extent of the premiums paid\nby him. It is not permissible to voluntarily take out a conventional medical\naid scheme.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
