  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSOME HEALTH GUIDELINES FOR RAMADHAAN%0D%0A%0D%0AThis article provides useful advice on how to avoid some common problems%0D%0Aencountered in Ramadhan. If followed, it would enable one to fast%0D%0Acomfortably and enjoy fully the spiritual benefits of Ramadhan.%0D%0A%0D%0ADuring the holy month of Ramadhan, our diet should not differ very much from%0D%0Aour normal diet and should be as simple as possible. The diet should be such%0D%0Athat we maintain our normal weight, neither losing nor gaining. However, if%0D%0Aone is over-weight, Ramadhan is an ideal time to normalise one's weight.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn view of the long hours of fasting, we should consume slow digesting foods%0D%0Aincluding fibre containing-foods rather than fast-digesting foods. Slow%0D%0Adigesting foods last up to 8 hours, while fast-digesting foods last for only%0D%0A3 to 4 hours.%0D%0A* Slow-digesting foods are foods that contain grains and seeds like barley,%0D%0Awheat, oats, millet, semolina, beans, lentils, wholemeal flour, unpolished%0D%0Arice, etc. (called complex carbohydrates).%0D%0A* Fast-burning foods are foods that contain sugar, white flour, etc. (called%0D%0Arefined carbohydrates).%0D%0A* Fibre-containing foods are bran-containing foods, whole wheat, grains and%0D%0Aseeds, vegetables like green beans, peas, sem (papry), marrow, mealies,%0D%0Aspinach, and other herbs like methie, the leaves of beetroot (iron-rich),%0D%0Afruit with skin, dried fruit especially dried apricots, figs and prunes,%0D%0Aalmonds, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe foods eaten should be well-balanced, containing foods from each food%0D%0Agroup, i.e. fruits, vegetables, meat%2Fchicken%2Ffish, bread%2Fcereals and dairy%0D%0Aproducts. Fried foods are unhealthy and should be limited. They cause%0D%0Aindigestion, heart-burn, and weight problems.%0D%0A%0D%0AAVOID%0D%0A* Fried and fatty foods.%0D%0A* Foods containing too much sugar.%0D%0A* Over-eating especially at sehri.%0D%0A* Too much tea at sehri. Tea makes you pass more urine taking with it%0D%0Avaluable mineral salts that your body would need during the day.%0D%0A* Smoking cigarettes. If you cannot give up smoking, cut down gradually%0D%0Astarting a few weeks before Ramadhan. Smoking is unhealthy and one should%0D%0Astop completely.%0D%0A%0D%0AEAT%0D%0A* Complex carbohydrates at sehri so that the food lasts longer making you%0D%0Aless hungry.%0D%0A* Haleem is an excellent source of protein and is a slow-burning food.%0D%0A* Dates are excellent source of sugar, fibre, carbohydrates, potassium and%0D%0Amagnesium.%0D%0A* Almonds are rich in protein and fibre with less fat.%0D%0A* Bananas are a good source of potassium, magnesium and carbohydrates.%0D%0A%0D%0ADRINK%0D%0A* As much water or fruit juices as possible between iftar and bedtime so%0D%0Athat your body may adjust fluid levels in time.%0D%0A%0D%0ACONSTIPATION%0D%0AConstipation can cause piles (haemorroids), fissures (painful cracks in anal%0D%0Acanal) and indigestion with a bloated feeling.%0D%0A%0D%0ACauses: Too much refined foods, too little water and not enough fibre in the%0D%0Adiet.%0D%0ARemedy: Avoid excessive refined foods, increase water intake, use bran in%0D%0Abaking, brown flour when making roti.%0D%0A%0D%0AINDIGESTION AND WIND%0D%0ACauses: Over-eating. Too much fried and fatty foods, spicy foods, and foods%0D%0Athat produce wind e.g. eggs, cabbage, lentils, carbonated drinks like Cola%0D%0Aalso produce gas.%0D%0ARemedy: Do not over-eat, drink fruit juices or better still drink water.%0D%0AAvoid fried foods, add ajmor to wind-producing foods.%0D%0A%0D%0ALETHARGY ('low blood pressure')%0D%0AExcessive sweating, weakness, tiredness, lack of energy, dizziness,%0D%0Aespecially on getting up from sitting position, pale appearance and feeling%0D%0Afaint are symptoms associated with \"low blood pressure\". This tends to occur%0D%0Atowards the afternoon.%0D%0ACauses: Too little fluid intake, decreased salt intake.%0D%0ARemedy: Keep cool, increase fluid and salt intake.%0D%0ACaution: Low blood pressure should be confirmed by taking a blood pressure%0D%0Areading when symptoms are present. Persons with high blood pressure may need%0D%0Atheir medication adjusted during Ramadhan. They should consult their doctor.%0D%0A%0D%0AHEADACHE%0D%0ACauses: Caffeine and tobacco-withdrawal, doing too much in one day, lack of%0D%0Asleep, hunger usually occur as the day goes by and worsens at the end of the%0D%0Aday. When associated with \"low blood pressure\", the headache can be quite%0D%0Asevere and can also cause nausea before Iftar.%0D%0A%0D%0ARemedy: Cut down caffeine and tobacco slowly starting a week or two before%0D%0ARamadhan. Herbal and caffeine-free teas may be substituted. Reorganise your%0D%0Aschedule during the Ramadan so as to have adequate sleep.%0D%0A%0D%0ALOW BLOOD SUGAR%0D%0AWeakness, dizziness, tiredness, poor concentration, perspiring easily,%0D%0Afeeling shaky (tremor), unable to perform physical activities, headache,%0D%0Apalpitations are symptoms of low blood sugar.%0D%0A%0D%0ACauses in non-diabetics: Having too much sugar i.e. refined carbohydrates%0D%0Aespecially at suhur (sehri). The body produces too much insulin causing the%0D%0Ablood glucose to drop.%0D%0ARemedy: Eat something at sehri and limit sugar-containing foods and drinks.%0D%0ACaution: Diabetics may need to adjust their medication in Ramadan, consult%0D%0Ayour doctor.%0D%0A%0D%0AMUSCLE CRAMPS%0D%0ACauses: Inadequate intake of calcium, magnesium and potassium foods.%0D%0ARemedy: Eat foods rich in the above minerals e.g. vegetables, fruit, dairy%0D%0Aproducts, meat and dates.%0D%0ACaution: Those on high blood pressure medication and with kidney stone%0D%0Aproblems should consult their doctor.%0D%0A%0D%0APEPTIC ULCERS, HEART BURN, GASTRITIS AND HIATUS HERNIA%0D%0AIncreased acid levels in the empty stomach in Ramadhan aggravate the above%0D%0Aconditions. It presents as a burning feeling in the stomach area under the%0D%0Aribs and can extend upto the throat. Spicy foods, coffee, and Cola drinks%0D%0Aworsen these conditions.%0D%0AMedications are available to control acid levels in the stomach. People with%0D%0Aproven peptic ulcers and hiatus hernia should consult their doctor well%0D%0Abefore Ramadhan.%0D%0A%0D%0AKIDNEY STONES%0D%0AKidney stones may occur in people who have less liquids to drink. Therefore,%0D%0Ait is essential to drink extra liquids so as to prevent stone formation.%0D%0A%0D%0AJOINT PAINS%0D%0ACauses: During Ramadhan, when extra salah are performed the pressure on the%0D%0Aknee joints increases. In the elderly and those with arthritis this may%0D%0Aresult in pain, stiffness, swelling and discomfort.%0D%0ARemedy: Lose weight so that the knees do not have to carry any extra load.%0D%0AExercise the lower limbs before Ramadhan so that they can be prepared for%0D%0Athe additional strain. Being physically fit allows greater fulfilment, thus%0D%0Aenabling one to be able to perform salah with ease.%0D%0A%0D%0ADr. Farouk Haffejee%0D%0AIslamic Medical Association of South Africa - Durban%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A"
