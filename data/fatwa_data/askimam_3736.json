A committee%0D%0Asystem has been established to undertake this, and this practice has been%0D%0Aaround for some time. However, some newly graduated Muslim scholars have%0D%0Astarted to oppose this practice. What is the correct position in this%0D%0Amatter? Please answer in detail quoting the relevant texts so that one may%0D%0Areadily act accordingly and also enjoin upon others to do so.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnswer%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AThe instruction of Shariah is that, following the death of a Muslim male or%0D%0Afemale, the body should be bathed, shrouded and the funeral prayer offered%0D%0Aaccording to the sunnah as soon as possible. It is stated in Maraaqil Falaah%0D%0Aas follows:%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0Ai.e. when death becomes certain the bathing, shrouding and the burial should%0D%0Abe hastened to respect the deceased as the instruction given in the Hadith%0D%0Ais to hasten. It is improper that the body of a Muslim should be delayed.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is Sunnah and preferable to bury the deceased in the burial ground of the%0D%0Aplace where the death occurred. It is Makrooh Tahrimi (severely%0D%0Areprehensible act) to transport the body to another town or country (without%0D%0Avalid excuse). It is stated in Maraaqil Falaah as follows:%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AIf there is no burial ground for Muslims at the place of death or other%0D%0Avalid excuse, then in such circumstances it will be permissible to remove%0D%0Athe body to the nearest burial ground where the body may be buried. It is%0D%0Astated in Maraaqil Falaah as follows:%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AThere is a significant Muslim presence here in the United Kingdom and many%0D%0AMuslim organisations provide a service through which the bathing and%0D%0Ashrouding of the deceased is easily performed. Local councils also provide a%0D%0Aseparate facility where Muslims may be buried in accordance with the%0D%0Arequirements of Shariah, therefore the deceased should be buried in the%0D%0Aburial ground reserved for Muslims in that very same town or city. If there%0D%0Ais a delay in burial due to legal requirements with regards to the release%0D%0Aof papers or there is a need for a post mortem. Then in such compelling%0D%0Acircumstances there will be no sin.%0D%0A%0D%0AThere is a principle in Shariah that if one has to commit a sinful or%0D%0Aseverely reprehensible, act to undertake a permissible action, then even%0D%0Athat permissible action, must also be refrained from. In view of this,%0D%0Awhilst transporting a deceased person to another town or country,%0D%0Aperpetration of the following many forbidden practices is seen to be in%0D%0Aevidence. Consequently, this practice can only be declared to be forbidden%0D%0Aand deserving abstention:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. The burial of the deceased is often delayed for two - three and even more%0D%0Adays, while the Shariah requires that the burial should take place as soon%0D%0Aas is possible. This requirement is not fulfilled.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Delay in burial also results in the deceased developing an unpleasant%0D%0Aodour and physical decay.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. According to the Hanafi Math-hab, the funeral prayer must only be%0D%0Aperformed once; not two or three times. In transportation of the body, gives%0D%0Arise to the funeral prayer being offered several times.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Health regulations of both of the respective countries require the body%0D%0Ato be injected with a certain matter and the dignity and respect deserved by%0D%0Athe deceased when alive must also be upheld after death. This dignity is not%0D%0Aupheld.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. According to some reliable people information, the internal organs of the%0D%0Adeceased are removed, and if this is correct, then this is a great injustice%0D%0Atowards Muslim deceased, that his or her organs are be disposed of in this%0D%0Away.%0D%0A%0D%0A6. The coffin is stored and carried like other luggage, which is a further%0D%0Ashow of disrespect.%0D%0A%0D%0A7. Heavy costs are incurred and a lot of effort is exerted without a valid%0D%0Areason.%0D%0A%0D%0A8. At the death of a husband, the wife is required to observe a period of%0D%0Awaiting. Contrary to this, sometimes the wife also travels with the coffin%0D%0Awhich is not permissible.%0D%0A%0D%0AAll of the above factors are those that are obvious. There are also many%0D%0Aother forbidden practices, which result from the transportation of the%0D%0Adeceased. Therefore, this practice must be corrected. The Muslim scholars%0D%0Awho oppose this practice do so correctly and are only fulfilling their duty.%0D%0ATherefore, one must adhere to what they say. There is also a full discussion%0D%0Aregarding this issue in Ahsanul Fataawaa V4, and the proof presented by%0D%0Athose who hold an opposing view has also been answered. It would be very%0D%0Abeneficial to refer to that discussion.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Knows best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ismail Kaccholvi%0D%0ADarul Ifta Wal Irshaad%0D%0AEngland, UK%0D%0A"
