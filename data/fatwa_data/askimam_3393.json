  "question": "Can one pray both Dhuhr and Asr together if time interval between them is short?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible to jointly perform 2 Salaats in one Salaat time, each Salaat should be performed in its specific time. However, if due to a\nvalid excuse, e.g. on a journey, etc. then it will be permissible to delay\nDhuhr until the end of its time and Asr could be performed in its beginning\ntime. That is apparent joining of two Salaats.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
