  "answer": "QUESTION\nI live in America im wondering if i can become a police officer. Even though I would be helping the U.S. with crime and all. Would it be right for me to become an officer or should I choose another career.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, to assist the oppressed is permissible and an act of virtue.\nTo be party to oppression is Haraam (strictly prohibited).\n\nThe above criterior should be used to determine your decision as a police\nofficer. If your position as an officer will be only to combat crime, and\nassist the troubled, etc. then there is no prohibition in becoming an\nofficer. Surely, as an officer, you will be required to follow rules and\nprinciples. You should measure those rules and principles through the\nabovementioned criteria and decide on that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
