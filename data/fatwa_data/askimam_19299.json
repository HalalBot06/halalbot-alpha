  "question": "Is it permitted and accepted to perform jummah in such a small musalla? it is small but build on the laws of sharia.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a question regarding Jumuah: Our local Maulana in Germany (in this city we have one alhamdulillah) helped us to get a musalla 3x5m (max capacity maybe 10people) in our central building of the university clinic. After he performed 2 jummah with 4-6 people he told us, that it is not allowed to perform jummah in such a small place. we are very sad because we can´t get off for jummah fridays and we struggled and worked hard to get a musalla and we build the musalla 100% to the command of our maulana. He says we can instead perform Dhuhr Salah. Before we performed zuhr salat without musalla anyway. what should we do? Is it permitted and accepted to perform jummah in such a small musalla? it is small but build on the laws of sharia. most of us are hanafis and strictly listen to our maulana. but know we have the problem that we do not have jummah anymore. what should be do? jazakamullahu khairan for your time reading and answering my request.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\n \n\nAs-salāmu `alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\nJumuah Salāhis valid in any room or musallā that lies within a city, a town or its outskirts as long as any Muslim is allowed access to the musallā.\n\nIf, however, there is a genuine reason to have restrictions on public access, such as for security or administrative purposes, then doing so will be permissible as long as there are other venues available in the city or town where Jumuah Salāhis offered without such restrictions.\n\nAlthough it is better to gather in larger groups on this specific day so that the central purpose of the day of Jumuah is realized, the Jumuah Salāhwill be valid with aminimum of 3 sane, mature males in addition to the Imam who are present from the beginning of the khutbah until the sajdah of the first rak'ah.
