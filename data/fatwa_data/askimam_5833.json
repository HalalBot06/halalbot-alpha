  "answer": "QUESTION\nI recently said my Shahada, but there were no witnesses present except my husband. Should I go to the mosque to say my Shahada with witnesses? I do not have a car (and the mosque is far), and my husband does not remember how to pray, so he cannot teach me. How can I learn this? Also, a few years ago I recieved tattoos upon my back, and legs, what should be done about these? Should I adopt an Islamic name? My name is not anti-Islam, but it is a name used by many Christians. If so, would Ghaada be acceptable? My husband also does not approve of Hijab. What should I do? I always wear loose clothing and long sleeved clothes though.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. A person becomes a Muslim when he/she believes in Allah, His Prophet and\nall other beliefs according to Islam and verbally proclaims that. If you\nverbally proclaim being a Muslim and all other Islamic beliefs, you are\nalready a Muslim. You may continue doing so to the people of your community.\n2. You and your husband should seek the advice of the Imaam of your locality\nin educating yourselves in Islam and the manner to pray. If there is an\neducational programme there, you may take part in that. Every possible\neffort and sacrifice should be made to educate yourselves in Islam.\n3. You should adopt a Muslim name.\n4. We advise you study the document on Hijaab and advise your husband on it.\nWhen he understands, he may permit you to observe Hijaab without difficulty.\n5. You will be excused for the tattoos.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
