  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ncan you please tell me the source of this hadith\n\nWhen a man dies and his relatives are busy in funeral rites, there stands an extremely handsome man by his head. When the dead body is shrouded, that man gets in between the shroud and the chest of the deceased. When after the burial, the people return home, 2 angels, Munkar and Nakeer (names of two special Angels), come in the grave and try to separate this handsome man so that they may be able to interrogate the dead man in privacy about his faith. But the handsome man says, \"He is my companion, he is my friend. I will not leave him alone in any case. If you are appointed for interrogation, do your job. I cannot leave him until I get him admitted into Paradise\". Thereafter he turns to his dead companion and says, \"I am the Qura'an, which you used to read, sometimes in a loud voice and sometimes in a low voice. Do not worry. After the interrogation of Munkar and Naker, you will have no grief. When the interrogation is over, the handsome man arranges for him from (the angels in Heaven) a silk bedding filled with musk. May Allah bestow this favour on all of us. AMEEN AMEEN Rasulullah (Sallalloho alaihe wasallam) said, \"On the Day of Judgement, before Allah, no other intercessor will have a greater status than the Qura'an, neither a Prophet nor an angel.\" Please keep forwarding this \"Hadith\" to all ...because the Prophet (PBUH) said : \"Pass on knowledge from me even if it is only one verse\"\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\n This hadith is narrated by Ubada bin As Samit (radiallahu anhu) and has been recorded by Uqaili in his Ad-Duafa, Ibn Abi Ad Dunya in his Tahajjud, Ibn Ad Darees in Fadaa’il of Quran and has been classified as BAATIL by these and other Scholars of hadith.(Tanzeehush Shar’iyyah, vol 1, pg 292) (AL la’aalil Masnoo’ah, vol 1, pg 219)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
