  "question": "What should the niyyat be when getting married so that we will be fulfilling the sunnah and getting thawaab?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI know there is a hadeeth that goes something like that you fulfill half your religion by getting married. I am a girl and recently got engaged and will inshaallah be getting married in a few years. Alhamdolillah the engagement was just an agreement between the two parties and no especial occasion was celabrated and nothing unislamic happened. I know the guy prays namaaz regularly alhamdolillah but I don?t think he strictly follows the shariah and sunnat. But for some reason I feel that he will change after marriage. Also I did istikhara namaaz and use to do a lot of duaa to Allah that He gives me a pious husband. When I think about getting married I think of us obeying the shariah and sunnah, and with having obedient and Allah fearing kids (inshaalah). Is my intention right and will I get the thawaab mentioned in the hadeeth? Or if not what should my intention be? How can I change my intention so that it is right? Please pray for the success and blessings of Allah in our marriage. Also, I sometime start to doubt if I made the right decision by saying yes to the engagement. Although I did do istikhara. Should I pay attention to these doubts or think that they are shaytaani and leave everything to Allah and pray?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour intention for marriage is correct. You will be rewarded for making the correct intention. If you had taken all the necessary precaution before committing to marriage, for example, enquiring about the boy?s character you had also consulted your seniors and made Istikhaara, now you should place your trust in Allah and make Du?aa for a prosperous marriage.\n\nNo one knows the future and we all are trapped in Ilmul Ghayb (knowledge of the unseen). It is, therefore, natural for you to have fear in such a major commitment in life.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
