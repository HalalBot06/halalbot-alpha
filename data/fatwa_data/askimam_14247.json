The difference stems from 48 miles being Shar’ee miles or English miles. A Shar’ee mile is longer than an English mile. 1.67 is equivalent to an English mile. If an English mile is considered, then it will be 77 kms. If a Shar’ee mile is considered, then it will be 88 kms.\n\nThe Jamee’atul Mufteen (Board of Muftis) consisting of eleven Darul Iftas of South Africa is to discuss this on the 27 May 2006. We will make an announcement regarding the verdict of the Jamaee’atul Mufteen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
