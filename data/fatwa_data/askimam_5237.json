  "question": "Smoking Drugs",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have heard that if you consume drugs, you are not allowed to perform any acts of ibadaat(eg. Salaat) for 40 days. Is this true?? If not, then what is the ruling on taking drugs?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhat you heard is not true. You probably misunderstood.\n\nWhen a person consumes intoxicants, his Salaat is not accepted by Allah for\nfourty days - this as a sort of punishment for this evil. This does not mean\nhe is not allowed to perform his Salaat. The Salaat is obligatory on him at\nall times. However, he is not permitted to perform Salaat whilst\nintoxicated. For your information - all intoxicants are prohibited, this\nincludes drugs.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
