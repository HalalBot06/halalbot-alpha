  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to be informed on whether it is permissible for a woman to break her fast during the day should she get her periods.\n\nI pose this question because i heard on the radio that should your periods occur before 12 in the afternoon, one should break her fast by eating. Should the periods occur after 12 then one should wait till iftaar to eat.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf a woman, whilst fasting, gets her period, she has to break her fast and make Qadhaa. It is permissible for her to eat secretly and openly. However, honouring the month of Ramadhaan, she should not eat openly. If a woman becomes cleansed from her periods during the day of Ramadhaan, then she has to abstain from eating and drinking like a fasting person.
