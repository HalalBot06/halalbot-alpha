  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it Halaal to take a loan from Saudi Arabian bank\n\n1. Assalam Alikum, Is it Halaal to take a loan from Saudi Arabian bank as they claim the loan will be provided according to Islamic Sharia, for example, if I obtain a loan of SR. 50,000 after paying my 2 years installments I end up total re-paying 60,000/- the excess SR. 10,000 bank calls as commissions/service charge, my question is, its not called Interest / Ribah?. 2. Asslam Alaikum, If I buy a property from my father in law less than the market value, considering I am his Son in law is it allowable? And is he has to take permission from his sons for this act? Please comment. 3. Is it accepted if I perfom wudu after taking the Janaba Ghusla?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. It is not permissible to take a loan from a Saudi Arabian bank where you end up paying more than the amount you had borrowed from the bank as this is Ribaa.\n\n2. It is permissible for you to purchase a property from your father-in-law below the market value. He does not need the permission of his sons as the property belongs to him and he has full liberty to do whatever he wishes with it.\n\n3. It is not advisable to perform Wudhu after Ghusl. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has mentioned in a Hadith, ‘Whoever performs Wudhu after Ghusl, he is not from amongst us.’ (Tabrani). Therefore, one should abstain from performing Wudhu after Ghusl. Rather, one should do the Wudhu before the Ghusl\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
