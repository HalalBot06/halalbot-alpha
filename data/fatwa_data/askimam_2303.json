  "question": "Istikhara: Respected Sir, I and my friend both did Istikhara a few times. But for some reason we both didnt even have a single dream or vision or any other sign. What should we do now ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am not very religious (extremely ashamed to admit it) but my friend is. So i was hoping that she will get a sign but didn't. I consulted a friend of mine who said that since we both didn't see a positive or a negative sign, we can decide what to do. In other words, we choose our own destiny.... he also suggested to me that maybe Allah wants us to decide. I really dont want to give up on her without a sign from Allah. I dont know anyone else who can do Istikhara for me either. And to make things worse, her parents are totally against marrying her to a stranger so they dont even want to see me. And they are about to get her married to someone else without her will. Please show me a way out of this apparent deadlock. I am desperate for your help in seeking not only my better half, but the only half that matters to me. Thank you in Advance. Allah Hafiz\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is narrated in Sahih Bukhari from Hadhrat Jaabir (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?When you have a doubt regarding a certain matter (i.e. to accept a proposal or not, etc.) then perform two Rakaats of Nafl Salaat and recite the following Du?aa ??%0D%0A%0D%0AWe understand from this Hadith that the purpose of Istikhaara is to eliminate the doubt which one has regarding some matter. Therefore, Istikhaara should be made with a clear mind, and without being inclined to any side in that matter. Since the purpose of Istikhaara is only to eliminate the doubt and uncertainty which one has, it is not even necessary for one to see a dream or remember the dream if one had one. If upon awakening, one finds his%2Fher heart inclined to one side of the matter for which he%2Fshe made Istikhaara, then one should act in accordance to the inclination of his%2Fher heart. However, if one is still uncertain then one should continue making Istikhaara for 7 days. Insha Allah, the uncertainty which one has would be removed within this period, and one would (in most cases after receiving some indication in a dream) find his heart inclined to a certain side in that matter. If one is still uncertain after 7 days, which is possible, then one should resort to Istishaarah (seeking advice from a learned person, etc.)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The guidance through Istikhaara does not depend upon seeing a dream. It is%0D%0Aalso an indication in the heart.%0D%0A%0D%0AFurthermore, the outcome of Istikhaara does not imply that you will be%0D%0Amarrying the person in question. We advise you consult a person having close%0D%0Aties and influence on the girl?s family and request him to mediate %2F%0D%0Aintercede on your behalf. If all efforts are in vain, please your trust in%0D%0AAllah Ta?ala and resign yourself in Taqdeer (divine measure).%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
