  "question": "What is the meaning of “A’meen”, that is said after making a supplication? This is also used by the Christians, as ‘Amen’. Do the Jews also say this? Are there Hadiths that talk about this?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to majority of the Ulema, Aameen is an abbreviation of\n'Allaahummastajib lana\" (Oh Allah! Accept our Duaa (supplication))\n\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) had stated: \"I have been granted Aameen\n(to say) in Salaah and at the time of Du'aa. None was granted such before me\nexcept Moosa (Alayhis salaam). He would make Du'aa and Haroon (Alayhis\nsalaam) would say Aameen. So end your Du'aas with Aameen - Allah will surely\nanswer them for you.\" (Tafseer Ibn Katheer Vol.1 Pg.56; Darus salaam). From\nthis Hadith it is apparent that the Jews also are following the sunnah of\ntheir Nabi in saying 'Amen'. The Christians probably learned this practice\nfrom the Jews.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
