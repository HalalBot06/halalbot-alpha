Excessive wet dreams is abnormal but not a sin. However, masturbation is a sin. You should not resort to masturbation due to excessive wet dreams but consult your physician regarding the wet dreams.\n\n2. If you break your fast by masturbating, you should make up for it by keeping one Qadhaa fast. Also, make Tawbah and Istighfaar for breaking your fast and masturbating.\n\n3. It is Haraam (strictly prohibited) to talk unnecessarily with a Ghayr Mahram female. If there is a need, then one must observe the laws of Hijaab and modesty in doing so. To talk to a female simply because she is a colleague is Haraam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
