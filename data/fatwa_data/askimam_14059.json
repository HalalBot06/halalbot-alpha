  "question": "Ali (ra) considered Abu Bakr (ra) as treacherous, liar and sinful? Please provide me with the correct meaning",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThere is a Hadith in the Sahihayn which has created many doubts in minds about the relationship of Ali (ra) with Abu Bakr (ra) - And i am unable to find an answer. The Hadith is in Sahih Muslim Book 019, Number 4349\n\nWhen the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) passed away, Abu Bakr said:\" I am the successor of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).\" Both of you came to demand your shares from the property (left behind by the Messenger of Allah). (Referring to Hadhrat 'Abbas), he said: You demanded your share from the property of your nephew, and he (referring to 'Ali) demanded a share on behalf of his wife from the property of her father. Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had said:\" We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity.\" So both of you thought him (i.e. Abu Bakr) to be a liar, sinful, treacherous and dishonest. And Allah knows that he was true, virtuous, well-guided and a follower of truth. When Abu Bakr passed away and (I have become) the successor of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him), you thought me to be a liar, sinful, treacherous and dishonest.\n\nDoes this mean that Ali (ra) considered Abu Bakr (ra) as treacherous, liar and sinful? Please provide me with the correct meaning and interpretation of this Hadith. Salaam.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nHadhrat Ali [radhiallaahu anhu] did not consider Hadhrat Abu Bakr [radhiallaahu anhu] to be treacherous, liar nor a sinful person. The words in the Hadith which have been mentioned are the words of Hadhrat Umar [radhiallaahu anhu]. These are not the words of Hadhrat Ali [radhiallaahu anhu]. We have to understand the context of what Umar [radhiallaahu anhu] meant was that they were not pleased with the decree of Hadhrat Abu Bakr [radhiallaahu anhu] or the decree of Umar [radhiallaahu anhu].\n\nIn the first case, it seemed as though he was not happy with the decree of Abu Bakr [radhiallaahu anhu]. In actual fact, that was not the case. Once he came to know the reason of Abu Bakr’s [radhiallaahu anhu] decree he accepted it. In the case of the decree of Umar [radhiallaahu anhu], both Hadhrat Abbaas [radhiallaahu anhu] and Hadhrat Ali [radhiallaahu anhu] were made executors of the estate. They had a dispute with regard to that which was in their care. Both of them had differences of opinion in how to perform their duty. They wanted that land which was in their care to be divided – half entrusted to the care of Ali [radhiallaahu anhu] and half entrusted to the care of Hadhrat Abbaas [radhiallaahu anhu]. Hadhrat Umar [radhiallaahu anhu] rejected this proposal on the grounds that if he had to accept their proposal, with the passage of time, people would get a misconception that this land was the inheritance of Hadhrat Abbaas and Hadhrat Ali [radhiallaahu anhuma]. Hadhrat Ali [radhiallaahu anhu] had the utmost respect for Hadhrat Umar [radhiallaahu anhu] and Hadhrat Abu Bakr. [radhiallaahu anhu] He had taken the pledge of allegiance to both of them. When he was appointed Khalifah, he upheld the decree issued by Hadhrat Abu Bakr [radhiallaahu anhu] and Hadhrat Umar [radhiallaahu anhu].\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
