  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCould you tell me what the prophet said in his last sermon in great detail.i want to know everything he said.I heard he said that he fears for the believers that if they become to wealthy they will forget about allah and islam.i am still looking for this.Could you give me the full detail on what he said in his last sermon.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are many Ahaadith on the Last Sermon of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) but we will give you the most famous Hadith by Jabir (Radhiallaahu Anhu) which is as follows:\n\n \n\nRasoolullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) reached Arafaat on the ninth Thul Hijjah. A tent was pitched for him at a place called Namirah, which is near Arafaat. He stayed there in. At Zawwaal he ordered that the camel Qaswa, be saddled. He then mounted the camel. When he reached the valley of Urna, he addressed the people:\n\n \n\n\"Your blood and your wealth (possessions) are Haraam (sacred) on you just as this day, this month, this city. Listen attentively. Be cautious. All issues of the days of Ignorance are placed under my two feet, and even the blood of the Days of Ignorance. First and foremost I declare as terminated the blood of the son of Rabee’ bin Haarith (Ayyas). (This boy was from the tribe Bani Sa’ad, whom the tribe of Huzail killed while he was drinking milk. There was a battle between these two tribes and this child was struck with a stone which killed him.)\n\n \n\nAnd the interest of the Days of Ignorance is invalid and annihilated. And first and foremost I commence with the interest which is due to our tribe, which is the interest of our uncle Abbas bin Abdul Muttalib which is totally pardoned i.e. it will not be reclaimed from anyone. Fear Allah concerning women. You have taken them from the trust of Allah and have made their private parts permissible by the word of Allah. (by His order.) Your rights over them is that they do not allow any such person on your bed whom you do not desire (i.e. not to allow anyone whom you do not desire, be it a male or female, stranger or relative to enter your home) as says Nawawi. If she does so then beat her (lightly for reformation) and not severely (such that marks are left on the body). And her rights over you are that you provide for her provisions and clothing according to common law and custom. I leave amongst you such a thing\n\n \n\nthat if you hold fast to it then you will never be misled. That is the Kitaab of Allah. And when you are questioned concerning me (whether I have delivered the message to you or not), what will you say?\" The Sahabah (R.A.) said: \"We testify that you have propagated and conveyed the teachings of Allah, and have been affectionate (a well wisher0. Thereafter, Nabi (S.A.W.) raised his index finger to his sky and then lowered it to the people and said: \"Ya Allah, You be witness.\" He said this thrice.\" (Sahih Muslim with commentary of Nawawi, Vol. 1, Page 397)\n\n \n\nNB The additions between brackets are from the commentaries of Nawawi (R.A.A.) and Mullah Ali Qari (R.A.A.)\n\n \n\nThat which you have queried is in another Hadith which follows:\n\n \n\nAmr bin Auf (Radhiallaahu Anhu) said that Rasoolullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said: \"By Allah, I am not fearful regarding poverty upon you but I have a greater fear than that that the World should spread out (i.e. the riches of the world) before you the way it was spread out to the people before you. Then you will compete (in attaining it) the way the people before you did and it will destroy you the way it destroyed the people before you.\" (Bukhari and Muslim) (Extracted from Mishkaatul Masaabeeh, Kitaabur Riqaaq, Vol. 2, Page 440)\n\n \n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Muhammad Ashraf\nDarul Ifta – Jameah Mahmoodiya, Springs\n\n \n\nJOINT PROJECT WITH DARUL IFTA, MADRASAH IN’AAMIYYAH, CAMPERDOWN"
