  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am a new Muslim recently took Shahadah last Ramadan Al Hamdulilah and i was just reading a response you gave to a brother regarding reciting Quran in a graveyard for the decesead and i was wondering if it was permissable for me to do this for my decesead relatives even if they died kafirs? shukran jazakallah khayr\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is indeed heart-warming to know that you have embraced Islam, whilst on the other hand, it is sad that your relatives have passed away without Imaan. Guidance is the prerogative of Allah. He guides whoever he wishes to the straight path and allows others to go astray.\n\nIn the following verse of the Holy Qur’aan, the Prophet (salallahu alaihi wasallam) was prevented from seeking forgiveness for his beloved uncle who unfortunately passed away as a disbeliever.\n\nما كان للنبي والذين آمنوا أن يستغفروا للمشركين ولو كانوا أولي قربى من بعد ما تبين لهم أنهم أصحاب الجحيم    (113 :9) \n\n“It is not (proper)for the Prophet and those who believe, to ask Allah’s forgiveness for the Mushrikeen (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the oneness of Allah) even though they be of kin, after it become clear to them that they are the dwellers of the fire”.\n\nIn the light of the above, it will not be permissible to recite Qur’aan and send the reward to relatives who have passed away as disbelievers.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
