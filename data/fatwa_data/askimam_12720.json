  "answer": "QUESTION\nI just wanted to ask if our destiny has already been written for us and Allah (SWT) knows what we are going to do in our lives. How can we change our destiny. I mean if we are supposed to do something bad or sin then if this has been already written in our destiny we don?t have any power to change it? Please comment as I don?t understand. Also are there any times when you shouldn?t read the Quran? As I heard that the souls of people are allowed to visit the earth and there are certain times that you shouldn?t read\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Our destiny has already been written and Allah Ta?ala knows what we are going to do in our lives. Hadhrat Ubaadah ibn Saamit [Radhiallaahu anhuj] narrates that Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] said, ?The first thing that Allah created was the pen. Then Allah commanded it to write. The pen asked Allah what to write. Allah said, ?Write down Taqdeer (destiny).? Then the pen wrote what took place and what is to take place till the end.? (Tirmidhi). There are two types of destiny, a) That which is fixed and cannot be changed, e.g. death, rizq, etc. and b) That which is suspended by actions, e.g. how to do good %2F bad deeds. It should be noted that despite insaan having this choice to choose his actions, Allah is All-Knowing as to what each person will choose.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. A person is prohibited from reciting the Qur?aan when he is in the state of impurity, whilst in the toilet, whilst he is in the bathroom and whilst he is occupied in conjugal relationship. We are not aware of souls visiting the earth.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
