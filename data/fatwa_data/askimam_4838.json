  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaikum Mufti Brother, Please advice in my matter.I have 3 very good friends among which 2 are boys (X,Y) and one is girl (Z). I had made promise with X that I won?t disclose his identity to anyone. The girl asked me X?s real name and by mistake, I broke the promise and told her X?s real name. I feel very guilty because now X is not chatting to me and neither to his friend Y. Because of me, X and Y had a fight because X talked v.badly with the girl because she came to know X?s real name, so X?s bad behaviour made Y angry and their friendship broke. I just want X & Y to be friends again. Please suggest me a way in which I can explain him and tell him sorry. Is it right if I make a telephone call to him? Please, I need the reply soon.Thanks!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, we wish to point out that it is Haraam (strictly prohibited)\nto have a female friend. That has also been the root course of the problem\nbetween you, X and Y. You should terminate your friendship with the girl\nimmediately.\n\nWe advise you apologise to X and Y for acting inappropriately.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
