  "question": "My question is on repentance and disbelief. Are people who commit disbelief unknowingly considered kuffar? Will they spend an eternity in Hell?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nwhat if a person commits kufr, or shirk, or both, unknowingly? What is the ruling on such a person? Is he/she a disbeliever? I mean, they committed disbelief, unknowingly, and not intentionally. Had they known what they're doing is disbelief, they would never indulge in it, or would at least do tawbah for their sin. Are people who commit disbelief unknowingly considered kuffar? Will they spend an eternity in Hell?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is compulsory for every individual to educate him/herself regarding one?s fundamental beliefs. If a person is educated, he/she will not do anything out of ignorance.\n\nIt is for that reason that being ignorant of the fundamental laws of Islam is a major sin. One should sincerely repent for not educating him/herself and also repent for the act of disbelief.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
