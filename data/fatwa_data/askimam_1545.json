  "question": "I being a muslim baligh female, if do hijab i.e., what majority of the Muslim women do, cover their hair so that only their face is visible: is that ok?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease I want this confirmed, as I also see some other\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nAllah Ta√£la mentions in the Noble Qur'an, '(O Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam), tell the believing males to lower their gazes. tell the believing\nfemales to lower their gazes ...' (Quran 24:29-30). The injunction of\nlowering the gaze is clear that it is not permissible for strange males and\nfemales to look at one another. Due to the immorality of times and weakness\nof resistance, it is compulsory for a female to cover her face which is the\nfocus of her beauty. The covering of the face conveniently facilitates the\naccomplishment of the purpose of lowering the gaze.
