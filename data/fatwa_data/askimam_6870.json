  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)If a women has very thick eyebrows and smaill hairs around it, will it be permissible for her to bleach bits of it? 2) if we were looking for a husband for her, and she is not as beautiful as it is, and with that eyebrow, it makes her look worse, will it be permissible for her to bleach in this case, as we are finding difficulty looking for a husband for her?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMullah Ali Qari (R.A) has commentated that plucking of the facial hair is haraam (prohibited) for a woman with the exception of moustache or beard hairs, if any woman is unfortunate enough to be troubled by these. (Mirqaat Vol.8 Pg.295; Ashrafiyyah).\n\nHowever, if the eyebrows have become so dense that it is unseemly for a woman and incites abhorrence in her husband, it is permissible to trim it to a more appropriate and normal size. (Ahsanul Fataawa Vol.8 pg.76; Zakariyya Book Depot)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
