  "question": "Can men have a vasectomy? What is the ruling on wearing the trousers above the ancles? Jazzakallah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt will not be permissible for men to have vasectomy. A vasectomy is tantamount to permanent birth control which is not permissible. Moreover, it is also tantamount to ?change in the creation? which is prohibited in the Qur?aan. ?And I (Shaytaan) will order them to deface the nature created by Allah.? (Contemporary Medical Issues in Islamic Jurisprudence pgs.185-186)\n\nThe ruling of wearing the trousers above the ankles is Waajib (compulsory). It comes in a Hdith that whatever is below the ankles will be in the fire of hell.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
