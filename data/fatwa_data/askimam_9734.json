  "question": "what if a guy, marries his dad's sister's daughter (his cousin) that was breastfed by his mother once or twice when she was a baby? Should they get a divorce and have they been living in sin?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible to marry one?s foster cousin, if they were breastfed by the same women in infancy, i.e. till the age of two. However, if the foster brother and sister got married unknowingly, the marriage is null and void. The husband should verbally terminate the union.
