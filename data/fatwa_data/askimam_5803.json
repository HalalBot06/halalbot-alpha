  "question": "I was married to a girl whom I did not wanted to be my wife, I have not made intercourse with her, kindly advice, my nikah is still intact or not.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was married to a girl whom I did not wanted to be my wife, it was a forced marriage, now since 1996 I have not made intercourse with her, kindly advice weather my nikah is still intact or not.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person does not have intercourse with his wife, that does not effect\nthe marriage. The marriage is valid.\n\nHowever, it is abnormal for the husband and wife not to be intimate for such\na long period. Both spouses have many obligations to one another. We advise\nthis abnormal relationship be addressed with the intention of amicably\nrestoring a normal relationship.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
