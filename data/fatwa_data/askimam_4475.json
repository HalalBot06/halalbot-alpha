  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamOalaikum! What is the proper way of reading Quran..? Can one read the Quran without having the Zudhu'h ? How shall we sit, and positioning towards the Kaba'h, what kinds of clothes we should wear, should we cover our heads with the Ku'fi..?, and the time of the day/night? Thanks!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is no need to have wudhu to merely recite the\nQuran without touching it. If one whishes to recite\nthe Quran by also holding it, then wudhu in necessary.\nThere is no specific direction to face while reciting\nthe Quran. However it is advisable to face the Qibla\nwhile reciting the Quran. In principal when one\nengages himself in any form of ibaddah (at any time\nday or night)it is advisable to dress respectfully.\nThat includes wearing a topee (head cap).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
