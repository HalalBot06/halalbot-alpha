  "answer": "QUESTION\nThe oldest human remains found are 20000 years old, they are relitively the same size. When find dinosaur bone which are far far older than humans\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said that 'Aadam (Alayhis salaam) was 30 Ziraa tall.'\n\nZiraa is a measurement and one Ziraa is approximately half metre.
