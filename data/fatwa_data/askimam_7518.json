  "question": "If I am an Imam which surahs are better to read? For example in fajr if an Imam reads longer surahs(like surah Jummah) is it better than reading shorter ones",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nFor example in fajr if an Imam reads longer surahs(like surah Jummah) is it better than reading shorter ones(surah Al-Falaq) even though it is a greater chance to make a mistake in a longer surah. If the Imam makes a mistake and the muqtaddis are not able to correct the Imam since they do not know that particular surah will the salat still be valid if a) the meaning changes but the Imam and muqtaddis are unaware of this b) there is only a subtle change such as use \"fa\" instead of \"wa\" or if we say something like \"Azabun Aleem\" instead of \"Azabun Azeem\" The situation is for non-Arabs who are not fully aware of the meaning and not sure if the meaning changed or not.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Sunnat to recite in Fajr and Dhuhr Salaats from Surah Hujuraat upto and including Surah Burooj, and in Asr and Esha Salaats from Surah al-Taariq upto and including Surah al-Qadr and in Maghrib Salaat from Surah Bayyinaat till Surah Naas. (Tahtaawi pg.143; Al-Adhkaar of Imaam Nawawi pg.71)\n\nA, b, Such minor mistakes do not invalidate the Salaat.
