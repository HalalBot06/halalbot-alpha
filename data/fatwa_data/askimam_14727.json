  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSallam\n\nI just started doing hifz. My problem is that now i start going to taraweeh prayers and listening to the hafiz leading i feel like i don't want to do the Hifz anymore, because if I memorize the quran and what if I start forgetting. What kinds of sin will i get? Can you please give me a dua that will increase my memory? And also when is the best time to memorize the quran? Also can you please give me the rewards of becomming a hafiz. I went to a madressa and I didn't like it then i came back home. Do I get any sin for it? Where is the best madressa to study quran in canada?\n\nJazakallah\n\n \nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram Brother in Islam\n\nAssalamu alaukum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh\n\nYou commenced your hifz. That is a great blessing from Allah. Allah wants to grant you great rewards and elevate your status. Thank Allah for that and express your thanks by continuing with your hifz. If you discontinue your hifz, you will be ungrateful to Allah. Do not gauge yourself on other peoples abilities. Everyone is different. You too are different.\n\nVirtues of a Haafiz.\n\n1. Allah Ta’ala has undertaken to preserve the Quran. A Hafiz is an official guard of Alllah for the Quran. Who can be more noble than such a person?\n\n2. Rasulullah Sallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam said, \"The best among you is he who learns the Quran and teaches the Quran.\"\n\n3. Rasulullah Sallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam said, \"A person is rewarded at least 10 times for reciting one alphabet.\" There are 6666 verses in the Quran. If we assume every verse has a minimum of 3 alphabets, that will be approximately 20000 alphabets. That multiplied by 10 is 200 000. If a hafiz has to recite the entire Quran at least ten times while memorising the Quran, he will secure 2 million rewards. What about the rewards for the other alphabets? What about reciting the Quran more than 10 times? What about teaching others the Quran. The reward of all that is beyond ones comprehension. Only Allah knows.\n\n4. A hafiz will be able to intercede for 10 family people on the day of Qiyamah for whom the fire of hell has become compulsory.\n\n5. When a hafiz is engaged in reciting the Quran and he does not make zikr and dua, Allah will grant him more than those who make zikr and dua.\n\n6. It is because of such great virtues Rasulullah Sallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam said, \"A haafiz who recites the Quran often is worth envying.\n\n7. Rasulullah Sallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam said, \"An expert in the Quran is with the Honourable Angels.\"\n\n8. Rasulullah Sallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam said, \"Allah has a household and his household are the bearers of the Quran (Hafiz).\n\n9. In order to attain the above mentioned lofty status, you have to sacrifice, wake up early in the morning, fajr time and memorize. That is the time the mind is fresh and alert. We do not know where you are located in Canada. You are nevertheless welcome to study by us in South Africa.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n1. When the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\n2. The guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\n\n3. Education and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\n\n4. Islam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\n\n5. When one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\n\n6. Muslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\n\n7. We have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\n\n8. If you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\n\n9. If that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\n\n10. Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, \"When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit\".\n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUR INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
