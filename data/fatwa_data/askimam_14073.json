  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am keeping up the missed fasts of ramadan.One day i was doing my wadoo and i was entering water in my nose and i felt that it is dry.I didnot sniff but took a little more water,more than that i took on the first and second time and it entered my throat through the nasal cavity(1 or 1.1/2 drops). I did wadoo2 times for namaz e zuhar and asar and it happened both times. Now i started to have a feeling that my fast is  invalidated.My question is that was my fast broken?\n\nThe second point(and here i am confused alot) is that to ensure that i am not deliberatily letting drops enter my nasal cavity.I tried to put water in my nose 3 times as in wadoo(but it wasnot wadoo). Again one drop entered my throat.At this time i feel to realize that my fast is invalidated because i read in behasti zewa! r that when you vomit and feel that your fast is broken and then eat something knowingly over that then the fast is really broken.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf a person is fasting and whilst making wudhu, some water enters his throat either by gaggling or washing the nose, then if one remembers he is fasting the fast will break and the Qadhaa of one fast will have to be kept. However, if one doesn’t remember he is fasting, then the fast will not break. (Tahtawi pg.672)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
