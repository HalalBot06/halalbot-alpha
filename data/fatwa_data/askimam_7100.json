  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWe have been brought up with the concept, that you should never make any negative comments about any arab muslims. They back this by a saying ?the stage a Arab Muslim might reach by descending, an non arab couldn?t reach that stage by elevating (regarding deeni matters).?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYes, it is true that you should not despise the Arabs nor talk ill of them. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was an Arab. It appears in a Hadith that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Love the Arabs for three reasons; I am an Arab, the Qur?aan is in Arabic, and the language of the people of Jannah is Arabic.? (Mishkaat vol.2 pg.553)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best"
