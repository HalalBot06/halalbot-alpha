The nature of marriage is such that it brings about joy and happiness to the couple and their families. Allah Ta’ala mentions so beautifully in the Qur’an:\n\nIn addition, among His signs is this that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that you may dwell in tranquillity with them, and He has put love and mercy between your hearts. Undoubtedly in these are signs for those who reflect. (Qur’an-30:21)\n\nMarriage is a religious duty, a moral safeguard as well as a social necessity. Through marriage, families are established and are regarded to be an essential component of our society. It is also a form of Ibaadah because it is obeying Allah Ta’ala and his messenger (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam). It is not a matter that can be taken lightly and should be entered into with total commitment and full knowledge of what it involves. Marriage is not like buying a new dress where you can exchange it if you do not like it. One should be mature enough to understand the demands of marriage so that the can be a lasting one.\n\nNevertheless, hereunder is a standard answer prepared by the Darul Ifta on contraception.\n\n \n\nCONTRACEPTION\n\n \n\nAll forms of contraception (e.g. condoms, IUD, etc.) are permissible on condition that it is not used out of fear of poverty and also that it is consentual between husband and wife. Hazrat Abu Saeed Khudri (Radhiyallahu Anhu) reports that one person asked Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) about Azal (Coitus Interruptus). Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) replied, “When Allah Ta’ala intends creating a child, nothing can stop him”.\n\n(Mishkat, Pg.275, Qadeemi)\n\n \n\nReversible\n\n \n\nChemical - the pill which is taken orally or spermicidal jellies used locally.\n\nMechanical - use of condom (intra-uterine device).\n\nPhysical - coitus interruptus.\n\nPermanent - sterilization operation - tubal ligations - vasectomies.\n\n \n\nQuestion 1\n\n \n\nIs the Practice of contraception allowed in Islam? If so, under what circumstances?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnswer\n\n \n\nContraception is permissible on a limited scale for valid reasons considered by the Shariah to be valid. The circumstances which will permit reversible and permanent contraception differ.\n\n \n\nREVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTION\n\n \n\nAmong the reasons accepted by the Shariah as valid for practising reversible contraception are:\n\n(A) Physical weakness.\n(B) Sickness.\n(C) The wife maintaining her beauty or figure for the sake of her husband.\n(D) The couple being on a journey or in a distant land.\n(E) Adverse political conditions, e.g. children are forcibly separated from their parents as is advocated by communism; etc.\n(F) The couple decide to separate in the near future.\n(G) The wife is an immoral person.\n\n \n\nThere are valid grounds for practising reversible contraception. Poverty or the fear of poverty are not valid reasons for contraception. It is not permissible to practice contraception on account of a fear of not being able to provide for a large family. Such a fear is an attribute of non-Muslims. According to the Qur’an Shareef: 'There is not a living creature, but its sustenance is the responsibility of Allah.'\n\nSimilarly desire to curb sexual desire which may stem out of piety is not a lawful ground for contraception. If practised for any reason which is unlawful in Islam, then contraception will likewise be unlawful, e.g. for indulgence in illicit sex\n\n \n\nPERMANENT CONTRACEPTION\n\n \n\nPermanent contraception is permissible only if the woman's life is in danger or her health is seriously threatened.\n\n \n\nThe usage of contraceptives will not affect the walima.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl.
