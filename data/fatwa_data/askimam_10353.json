  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaam alaikum, I know that this question has been asked in many ways but still would like to go ahead with it. Recently I completed my studies and also got a job. I know that the first place for women is in house but due to financila constraints I need to work. As my father is retired now and my elder two married sisters get money from us for their household. I a software professional and go to work in covering my head with a scarf and wearing full sleeves salwaar kameez. Is this attire of mine acceptable? Am i justified in working? I ahve decided that after marriage if my husband is wealthy enough then i would not work but if need arises i shall continue with the job. I don't want to commit a sin or be a part of it. But due to unavoidable conditions i need to go to work and also talk to my team mates who are gents. Will i be questioned regarding this on Qayamat? Hope u enlighten me with the Quran and hadeeth standings w.r.t this.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shari'ah, the place of a woman is at home. If she is unmarried, her father has to support and maintain her. If she is married, her husband has to support and maintain her.\n\nIf her father or husband is unable to support her and there is no other support system for her, then she may seek employment to support herself and her dependants. In doing so, she much adhere to the laws of Hijaab. She must conceal the form and shape of her body and avoid talking to non-Mahram males to the best of her ability. She may only work to fulfil her needs and until there is an alternative support for herself and her dependants. Once there is an alternative support for her needs to be fulfilled, she cannot continue working in a way that she is compelled to violate the laws of the Shari'ah. She will be excused by Shari'ah only due to necessity as that relaxes prohibition only fill the need.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n<"
