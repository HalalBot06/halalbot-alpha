  "question": "Can a woman travel without Mahram",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nEven if her husband is criticaly injured or one of her children? (emergency) give all 4 opinions. Jazak Allah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSayyiduna Abu Hurayra, Sayyiduna Abdullah ibn Umar, Sayyiduna Abdullah ibn Abbaas and Sayyiduna Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri [radhiallaahu anhum] have reported that Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] said, 'It is not permissible for a woman to undertake a journey (of 88 kms or more) without a Mahram (person with whom marriage is permanently prohibited, for example, father, brother, etc.).' (Sahih Bukhari Hadith3006, 1727 %2F Sahih Muslim Hadith3245, 3256, 3257, 3259)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is Makrooh-e-Tahrimi (close to Haraam) for a woman to travel for 88 kms or more without a Mahram. (Shaami vol.2 pg.465; HM Saeed). It is also not permissible for a woman to travel without a Mahram in short distances (lesser than 88 kms) if there is a fear of Fitnah, crime, etc. %0D%0A%0D%0AIt is unfortunate that the number of Muslim women that are travelling long distances alone - without a Mahram - is increasing by the day. It is also incorrect to assume that today's modes of transport to far distances are safe, or a woman is sure of safeguarding her chastity. %0D%0A%0D%0AIn fact, some women even travel alone to the holy places of Makkah Mukarramah and Madinah Munawwarah. How could one expect to achieve any benefit of such a journey when the basic requirement of Shari'ah - travelling with a Mahram - is not fulfilled. There are many incidents of women having been put into difficulty and their chastity been attacked by travelling alone in short and long distances. No mode of transport is error-proof and no woman is chaste-proof, especially in these times of vice and immorality.%0D%0A%0D%0AFurthermore, as believers, we express our submission to the laws of the Shari'ah. Allah Ta'ala is al-Hakeem (the All-Wise) and He and His Prophet [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] know the wisdom of the laws of the Shari'ah. Our responsibility is to express submission to the laws of Allah and His Rasul [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] whether we understand them or not. Know well that every law of the Shari'ah is filled with wisdom. That includes the prohibition of a female travelling long distances without a Mahram. %0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0ADarul Ifta - Madrasah In'aamiyyah, Camperdown%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
