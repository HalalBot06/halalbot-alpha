  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have a problem with controlling my urine. I can loose drops of urine anytime randomly. Most of the times it happens while I am praying and I have no control over it. It's getting very hard for me to keep praying in this condition and I need your advice on what I should do. Here are my questions; 1) Do I come under the category of Ma'zur? 2) Most of the times I am not at home so I can not clean my clothes before every prayer. What Should I do in this case? 3) I read on your website that a perosn can pray without cleaning the cleans if the amount of urine is less than a fill of the palm. Does that apply to me? 4) What if I made Wudu 10 minutes before the time of a prayer, can I still pray that prayer with my wudu or do I have to make wudu again after the time for that prayer starts? (5) Do I have to do istinja before every prayer?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, if the drops of urine come out within a period of making Wudhu and performing Salaat, and that problem lasts for any entire Salaat time, even if it is a short period, for example, in winter - the time between Dhuhr and Asr, then you will be a Ma?zoor.\n\nIn such a situation, the drops of urine will not invalidate your Wudhu and if the soiled portion of your undergarment is lesser than a palm?s fill, you will be excused to perform Salaat in that clothing.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
