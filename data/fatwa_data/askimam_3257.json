  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n%0D%0AWithout being bias or allowing your emotions to control you, you will accept%0D%0Athat you have certain rights over your husband and he has certain rights%0D%0Aover you. If he does not fulfil your rights, he will be answerable to Allah%0D%0ATa'ala on the day of Qiyaamat and if you don't fulfil his rights, the same%0D%0Awill apply to you. Therefore, womanising doesn't give you the certificate to%0D%0Adisobey him and stop fulfilling his rights.%0D%0A%0D%0ABeing his wife, you still have to obey him as long as his request is not in%0D%0Aconflict with the Shari'ah. As for his womanising, it is a sin like any%0D%0Aother sin. Therefore, you should treat him just as you would have if he was%0D%0Ainvolved in another sin. Never confront him regarding his sin, if you feel%0D%0Athat it may lead to the destruction of the marriage. Rather, make Du'aafor%0D%0Ahis guidance and reformation. Make life more interesting and exciting for%0D%0Ahim at home and adopt Sabr. It will be difficult for you, but you will have%0D%0Ato do it for the sake of your marriage and children. His womanising will,%0D%0AInsha Allah, stop. It is just a phase that he is going through. He can't%0D%0Acontinue womanising for his entire life. If you deem it appropriate, you may%0D%0Aaccompany him when he goes outdoors. May Allah Ta'ala grant you Sabr and%0D%0Agrant your husband the Tawfeeq to mend his ways and repent from his sin as%0D%0Aquick as possible.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
