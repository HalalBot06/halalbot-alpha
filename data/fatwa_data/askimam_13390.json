  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan you please advise me how to best deal with a hypocrite?  I know someone who is blaten hypocritical Muslim, who belittles all around him while he himself does far worse.  I don't want to excuse my wrong doings either, but I find it very hard to stomach at times.  Can you please advise me the best way to deal with this?\n\nThank you.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe appearance of a hypocritical nature does not necessarily render a person a hypocrite. From what you describe, the person is arrogant and vain.\n\nI suggest you advise him politely to better his ways and to refrain from the sins he is guilty of.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
