  "question": "What is Muslim view on Christ and crucifiction. Please provide full detail.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Muslim view of Eesa [Alayhis salaam] is indeed simple. Eesa [Alayhis salaam] is a prophet (Messenger) of Allah who was born without a father. Allah Ta'ala explains his birth in great detail in Surah Maryam aayaats 16 to 40.\n\nIt is our belief that Eesa [Alayhis salaam] is alive and was lifted to the heavens. Towards the close of this world, Allah will send him as a guide. It is important to note that he will be sent as a Nabi, but rather he will be an Ummati (follower) of Muhammad [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nWe do not believe that Eesa [Alayhis salaam] is god, neither do we believe him being a son to god. He is the messenger and slave of Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
