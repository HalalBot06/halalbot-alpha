  "question": "I get bored at home and wish to work or study...",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI've just been married a year ago and moved to UK from Pakistan. Before my marriage I led a busy life outside home teaching and studying. After marriage I have left job and studies. My husband is indeed a busy man. Though I am love working at home all the domestic chores. But I get bored. My father in law is also in Pakistan - he will come here soon. And my mother in law is also in Pak - she will stay with my brother in law. I feel strong urge to work or study outside the home. I want to meet and interact with people. When I came here I've been offered jobs and I worked at school. I still have offers to teaching courses. But that doesnt make my husband feel easy so I didnt persue with any. Please help me, I want to stay at home and dont want to get bored and depressed. There are few relatives here and they prefer keeping themselves to themselves.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakumullah Khair for your confidence in us.\n\nYour profession can be used successfully in many ways from home. Have you consulted perhaps writing children's books or educational guides for \"Home Schooling\", which is becoming a popular alternative throughout the world including our country. Bringing in an Islaamic Perspective to the secular curriculum is an approach many educators are employing in their teaching. Story books and nursery rhymes are also in demand. Alternatively offer tuition from home.\n\nFurthermore look towards studying deen. Try to acquire Maaariful Quraan tafseer available in English and Urdu, Riyaadus Saaliheen, Uswaai Rasool and Behisti Zewer. Study them cover to cover. May Allah Ta'ala grant you beneficail knowledge and use you for the khidmat (service) of deen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n2SOCIAL DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
