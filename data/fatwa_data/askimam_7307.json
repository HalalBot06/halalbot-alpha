  "question": "My son wishes to be Haafiz inshallah. Iâ€˜m pleased with his intention but concerned later in life, his Quran may be forgotten due to economic pressure, getting married, etc. I have seen many examples.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlhamdulillah, your son has a noble intention to put the Quraan in his heart. Concerns are many as pressures could be many. But we do not know the future, it is only Allah who is the Knower of everything. How many parents have children with such noble intentions.\n\nAlso remember that a Dua of a parent for a child is so very important, instead of worrying about the future make Dua for the present and the future that Allah makes a Haafiz and keeps the Quraan in his heart and makes him make Amaal upon it. Remember if proper love for the Quraan is cultivated into the child at a young age he would never leave the Quraan under any circumstance.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nShaykh Irshaad Amod / Moulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
