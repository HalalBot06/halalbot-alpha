  "question": "Can a 25 year old son-in-law hug his 58 year old mother-in-law?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan a 25 year old son-in-law hug his 58 year old mother-in-law? Can they handshake each other?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nA son-in-law is a Mahram to his mother-in-law and there is no observance of Hijaab between them. It is also important to point out that if the son-in-law or mother-in-law experiences passion while hugging one another, that will fall in the category of incest which will result in her daughterâ€™s marriage being invalidated. It is, therefore, important for the mother-in-law and son-in-law to conduct themselves in a modest way.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
