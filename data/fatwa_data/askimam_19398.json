  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi wabarakatahu\n\nRegarding Zakat,\n\nI have a second car which I do not use, which I am keeping to use at a later date or sell, is Zakat due on that car?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nIf you bought the car with the intention of selling it, Zakat is due on it. If you bought the car with the intention of using it and later you decided to sell it, Zakat is not due on it.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Faizal Riza,\nAustralia.\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
