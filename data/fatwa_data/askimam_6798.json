  "question": "(1) Is there a hadith where Rasulullah(saw) mentioned about the 4 imams to come(abu Hanifa etc.)? 2.I woke up once and wasn't sure if it was sunrise yet but quickly made wudu and prayed Fajr",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n(2) Later when I checked the time for sunrise, I realized that I prayed exactly at the time of sunrise. Do I have to perform Qada?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We are unaware of any such explicit Hadith.\n\n2. The time of expiry of Fajr Salaat is when any part of the sun becomes exposed from the horizon. Hence, if this happens after you have completed your Salaat, there would not be a need for Qadhaa, but if it takes place while you are still in Salaat, then the Salaat will be invalid for which you have to make Qadhaa.
