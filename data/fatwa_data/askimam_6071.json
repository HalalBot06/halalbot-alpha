  "question": "Is it right to start fights with non-muslims purely because they are non-muslims and have done nothing wrong???",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer below our standard reply to a similar query.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nThe statement, 'promoted killing of non-Muslims' is vague and sweeping and\nis very much open to misinterpretation. Yes, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) promoted the killing of these non-Muslims who are actively engaged\nin destroying Islam and the Muslims. This is the command of Allah Ta'ala\nHimself in the Qur'aan. This type of killing is not simply permissible, but\ncommendable and worthy of reward. This does not mean that Islam teaches to\nkill all non-Muslims.\n\nIf, for example, a Muslim intentionally kills a non-Muslim citizen of the\nIslamic state, then in retribution the Muslim's life will be taken. This\nindicates that even the life of a non-Muslim is sanctified, if he does not\noppose Islam and the Muslims.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nF"
