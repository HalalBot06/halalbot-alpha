  "question": "travel with father-in-law for hajj ??",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nif a woman wants to  go for hujj will her father-in-law be her mehrum, if her husband is not going with her or should she go with her husband only?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn principle, a father-in-law is a Mahram. It is prohibited for him to marry his daughter-in-law just as it is prohibited to marry one’s daughter or sister.\n\nA woman can travel with her Mahram. That also includes the father-in-law. However, there is no doubt that there is a difference between a daughter and daughter-in-law. A man could be attracted to his daughter-in-law. That is not so much in the case of a daughter. It is, therefore, advisable that precaution be taken and the daughter-in-law do not travel alone with the father-in-law.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
