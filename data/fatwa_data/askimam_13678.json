  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI want to do aqiqa of my 2yr daughter.I want to know shaving of head is compulsory in Aqiqa.as i have shave her head many times.Can i do it in the 3rd year as she is in the 3rd year now.One more thing She was born on monday so i should do the aqiqa on sunday or i can do on any day like wednesday,friday etc pls let me know.\n\nJazakallahkhyrn\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf you did not do the Aqeeqah for your daughter at the time of her birth, you may do it now. It is advisable to maintain the seven day order in doing the Aqeeqah. Your daughter was born on a Monday, the seventh day will also be Monday. If it is difficult to perform the Aqeeqah on Monday, it may be done on any day of the week.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
