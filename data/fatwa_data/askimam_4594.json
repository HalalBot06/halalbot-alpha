  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a Punjabi Sikh based in India of age 19 years. I wanted to ask you the deeper meaning behind a dream of mine which I had around 3:30 a.m. in the morning. The dream was that I visualized a rectangular structure which was like a tent black in colour and had frills resembling the Mecca, it was bright sunlight all around and I saw the sky up above which was totally bright with a bright streak of light coming into my eyes. The next thing I saw was that I was in a telling my parents that I want to convert to islam , it was a big hall and I had a thick book in my hand. Thank You. ANUJ MADAN P.S.: As I do not frequent your website being a non-muslim could you please reply on my personal e-mail madan@uwindsor.ca\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHope you are well. The dream is indeed a blessed and true dream.\n\nThe rectangular structure seen by you was the Ka'bah, the holy house in\nMakkah built by the Prophet Ebrahim (Abraham). That is the direction of\nprayers for a Muslim. The dream is an indication for you to change your\ndirection of life to the truth - Allah and Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
