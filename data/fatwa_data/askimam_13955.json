  "answer": "QUESTION\nI wanted to know that is it allowed in Islam to help non-Muslims? For example we send sadqas and money to help Muslims around the world like the earth quake victims or the African Muslims. So is it allowed to help non-Muslims if they are dying? For example there are many African non-Muslims who are dying due to hunger, kids are without clothes and water. They don’t have shelter and heating facilities. So can we send them aid as a human? Because watching a child die in hunger is very painful. Can we help them not as Muslims but as humans?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIslam is a perfect and complete religion that has taught us every minute detail, even what to do when we relieve ourselves. Once some Mushrikeen mocked Salmaan [radhiallaahu anhu] that your Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has even taught you what to do in the toilet. Salmaan [radhiallaahu anhu] said, ‘Yes, our Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] has taught us how to use the toilet…’ (Mishkaat pg.44; Qadeemi)\n\nIslam is perfect and complete and has taught us how to deal in every situation, whether it relates to social, economic, political or domestic life. Islam has even taught us how to interact with non-Muslims and how to show kindness to humans and animals. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Allah does not show mercy on that person that does not show mercy on the people.’ (Mishkaat pg.421)\n\nIslam has taught us to show mercy to Muslims and non-Muslims as well. In the Hadith, Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Have mercy on those on earth, the One in the sky will have mercy on you.’ (Mishkaat pg.423). The entire creation are the family of Allah, and the best of Allah’s creation are those who show mercy on the creation of Allah. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said that once there was a person who felt very thirsty while travelling. He found a well so he climbed down and drank some water, when he came out he saw a dog panting and sucking the sand because of severe thirst.\n\nIslam has even taught us to show kindness to animals. This traveller took pity on a thirsty dog and gave it water to drink, Allah showed his mercy on this person and appreciated his action although it was a small action. Therefore, we as Muslims, should show kindness not only to Muslims, but even to non-Muslims. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] was kind to all creation of Allah. He visited the sick, helped the poor and distressed and was kind even to his enemies.\n\nNabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘The best of people are those who are most beneficial to people.’ This Hadith implies that one who is most beneficial to all kinds of people (Muslim or non-Muslim) is the best person. Even if a Muslim plants a tree and a human or an animal eats from that tree, he will be rewarded. (Bukhari6012)\n\nAs human, we should help and assist one another (Muslim or non-Muslim) when they are distressed or in need, and Insha Allah, we will be rewarded abundantly.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
