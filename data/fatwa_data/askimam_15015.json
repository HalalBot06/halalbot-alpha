  "question": "Can one pray part of a long Surah in Salaah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni would like to know - that when leading a prayer with a group of people, in the first two rakats you recite out aloud (for fajr, maghrib and isha) al-fatiha and another surah after that, am i allowed to just recite a small part of a long surah such as al-baqara rather than reciting the whole surah after al-fatiha. The reason i am asking is because it is difficult to memorise the longer surahs but the verses within them are so good to read.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is permissible to recite a part of a long Surah instead of a full short surah after Surah Al Fatiha.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
