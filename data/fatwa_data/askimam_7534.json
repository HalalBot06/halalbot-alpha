  "question": "can you please explain the difference between saying “Islam says be moderate” and “Islam says follow the middle way?”",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) can you please explain the difference between saying ?Islam says be moderate? and ?Islam says follow the middle way?? 2) Also, I have a hard time controlling my desires. Can you tell me how I can learn to control them? 3) On the highway we see dead animals in the middle of the road. What should we do, should we move them to the side or bury them or something? 4) Are girls allowed to wear toe rings?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The ?middle? way is in reality ?moderation?. In all affairs and aspects, we are encouraged to adopt the middle path and not to be too lax nor to exceed the bounds. Allah Ta?ala says in the noble Qur?aan, ?And we have made you a moderate nation.? When we say that Islam is a religion of moderation, it means moderate according to the way we have been shown by our Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and not what the present times dictates to be moderation. This moderation in Islam is actually the ?middle way? which is desired by Allah. The Christians exceed the bounds and Jesus to be God and the Jews proclaimed Uzayr as the son of God. We are ordered to adopt the middle path and believe Allah to be One and Alone and Nabi Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) to be the final messenger.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. In order to gain control over one?s desires and Nafs, one has to inculcate within oneself the fear of Allah. This fear will be cultivated when a person makes an effort on one?s Imaan. As Imaan increases in the heart, fear of Allah will also increase. In order to increase one?s Imaan, a person will have to strive in the path of Allah and invite others towards Allah. The more a person will speak about Allah, the more his Imaan will increase. Another effective method is to keep close contact with a pious, Allah-fearing person through his companionship and company, all evil habits will vanish. An instant method to avoid sin is for one to remind oneself at all times that Allah is looking at me, He is listening to me and He is fully aware of the condition of my heart. This will be a deterrent for one from following one?s desires. Whenever you have an inclination to follow your desires, this Du?aa can be recited: Allaahumma-j-al wasaawisa qalbiy khash-yataka wa dhikraka%0D%0A%0D%0A3. The ideal thing will be to bury them and if one is unable to do so then at least move it to one side.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. Yes, they are allowed to wear toe rings as long as it is within the confines of their homes and not to attract the opposite sex.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
