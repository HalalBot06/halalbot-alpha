  "question": "I built mosques, madrasah & orphanage from money received by me from bribery. Will I get any soab (good from Allah) out of it ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIncome from bribery is Haraam (strictly prohibited). Haraam money must be\ndisposed off by giving it in charity to the poor and needy without the\nintention of gaining any reward.\n\nFrom the three avenues explained by you, only the orphanage may be\nclassified as the appropriate avenue for dispensing such money. It is not\npermissible to use Haraam money to build a Mosque or Madrasah. In order to\nundo the wrong, we advise you give Sadaqah (charity) to the poor and needy,\nat least, equivalent to the expended amount on the Mosque and Madrasah. That\nmay be done over a period of time. If you adopt the above outlet, it is\nhoped you will be forgiven and tremendously rewarded by Allah Ta'ala for the\nbuilding of the Mosque and Madrasah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
