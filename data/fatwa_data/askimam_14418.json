  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDoes the other musallee(who was also part of this jamat) and I have to repeat our salah? (Please refer to details below)\n\nI have led the asr jama'at in salah as imam. The iqamah for the salah was made by a shia. In the iqamah he had mentioned something twice between the words \"Hayya ala salah\" and \" Qad Qa'mati salah\". I dont remember what he had said but the words are normally used by the shias in their iqamah. Is it necessary to repeat the salah?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe Iqaamat of the Shi’as with the additional words of Hadhrat Ali [radhiallaahu anhu] being a friend of Allah is incorrect. We, the Ahlus sunnah Wal Jamaa, have the greatest amount of respect for Hadhrat Ali [radhiallaahu anhu] as well as all the Ahlul bayt and all the Sahaaba. The issue of Adhaan and Iqaamat is different and should be called out as taught to us by Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam].\n\nIt is incorrect to make any addition in the Adhaan or in the Iqaamat. If by error, a Shi’a called out the Iqaamat, it should be repeated in order to correct the wrong method of Iqaamat. Adhaan and Iqaamat both are Sunnat-e-Muakkadah and must be corresctly recited before the Fardh Salaat. If the Adhaan and Iqaamat are not recited or incorrectly recited, that is a sin. However, the Fardh Salaat is a separate and an independent act and its validity does not hinge on the Adhaan and Iqaamat. If the Adhaan and Iqaamat were not called out or incorrectly called out, that will be a separate shortfall but the Salaat will be valid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
