  "question": "As-Salaam-u-Alaikum. My question concerns the manner in which you should correct someone that makes a mistake in Salaat. Please read the details. Jazakallahu-khair.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI read a hadith that said that males should say \"Subhaanallah\" and that females should clap. I have 2 questions: 1) Does saying Subhaanallah apply to all corrections for a male? (e.g. if Imam forgets to sit in 2nd rakaat, you should say Subhaanallah?) 2) Should females only clap if in Jamaat? (i.e. what if one sister was to notice that another sister had made a mistake - should she clap?)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. A male muqtadee (follower) should correct any error\nmade by the Imaam by reciting Subhanallah. This\nincludes error in not sitting after the second rakaah.\n\n2. A female muqtadee (follower) may correct the Imam\nonly by hitting the back of her palm.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
