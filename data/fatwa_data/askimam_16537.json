  "question": "Performing Salaah behind a Muqeem Imam",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nif a person is more than 100 kms away from his house.. as in hadis it say musafir  should pray 2  rakat  in zuha\nbut while traveling we say masjid can we pray 4 rakat namaz at that time\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIf a musafir performs Zuhr, Asr and Esha behind an Imam of a musjid who is a muqeen (not a musafir) then one will have to follow the Imam and perform four rakats salah. If a musafir performs salah by himself in a musjid, he will have to perform two rakats salah in Zuhr, Asr and Esha salah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
