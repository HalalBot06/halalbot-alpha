  "question": "What is the Sunnah way of Dua after Imam finishes leading fard prayers?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf have seen different practices in different mosques. In some mosques Imam does not make Dua after Fard prayers. In others it is almost compulsory for Imam to make Dua after every Fard prayers. Further, in some other mosques Imam makes Dua two times, one is immediately after Fard prayers and other after finishing the complete prayers? I am confused as to what is the Sunnah way and what did Prophet pbuh did at the end of Fard prayers?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nThe best method of making dua after the fard salah is that each person should make his own dua silently. This dua should be short, thus not creating a long gap between the fard and the sunnats.If the need arises to teach the people how to make dua, then the Imam can make dua loudly, for a while, however he should ensure that he doesn’t disturb those completing missed rakaats.\n\nIt is sunnah to raise the hands in dua and to pass the hands over the face after dua.\n\nThe second dua ie. the one after the sunnah salah, is bidah and is against the practice of Nabi (sallallahu Alaihi wa sallam) the Sahaba and Tabi’een (Radhiallahu Anhum).\n\nSee Fatawa Rahimiyyah Vol. 6 Pg.58-81-Darul Ishaat,Noorul Eidaah Pg. 80, Maraaqi and Tahtaawi alal maraaqi Pg.310-316 ?
