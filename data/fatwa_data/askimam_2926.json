  "question": "Is State divorce the same as Talaq?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMe and my wife have been divorced by a state judge in USA, but my ex wife wants to keep bodily relations with me. In Islam are we divorced or do I need to utter the word Talaq three times to her?, also have we been comitting sin since we had relations after the court divorce?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf the husband instituted divorce through court and it was granted, it will\nbe regarded as only one Talaaq-e-Raj'ee (revocable divorce). The husband can\nrevoke the divorce within the Iddat period.\n\nIf he did not revoke it, the Talaaq will be changed to Talaaq-e-Baain\n(irrevocable divorce). In such a situation, a reperformance of Nikah will be\nnecessary. If the wife instituted the divorce through Court, it will not\nconstitute Talaaq.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
