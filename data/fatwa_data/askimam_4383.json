  "question": "I’m 25 but have only practiced for 3 years. Do I need to make up 14 years of fasting & salah? I’m finding it hard to pray 5 daily prayers. What am I to do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt all depends on when you reached puberty. From the time of puberty upto 3\nyears ago, you are liable for all the missed Salaat and fasts.\n\nA simple method of covering up is to offer a Qadhaa Salaat after every Fardh\nSalaat. For instance, after every Fajr Salaat, perform the last missed Fajr\nSalaat, after every Dhuhr Salaat, perform the last missed Dhuhr Salaat and\nso on.\n\nContinue with this for the number of years you feel you need to cover up.\nThere is practically no excuse to omit the missed Salaats and fasts. We have\nmentioned a simple method of covering up the missed Salaats.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nfor: FATWA DEPT."
