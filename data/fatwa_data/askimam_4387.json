  "question": "Is it acceptable to give preference to higher education over marriage?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen I was in my last year of high school my cousin has asked me to marry him. However, he let me know that if I marry him I should not go to university and continue my studies. I understand that any kind of pre-marital relationship is prohibited in Islam. I was not in any such relationship with this cousin and infact I have not spoken to him alot. When he said this to me, I let him know that I want to continue my education and go to university and he told me he would not want to marry any woman who gets a high education and has a job after marriage. I did not find it necessary to follow his orders since he was not my husband, and I joined university. Now my relatives think that it was an act of pride to reject a marriage offer and choose education and they also tell me that I will not find a better husband than him since I might have hurt his feelings. Is my decision to choose education over marriage an act of pride and have I made a right decision? Please advice me. I only want to follow what is acceptable in islam. Jazakallah Khair\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen your cousin proposed to you, you should have made Mashura (consulted)\nwith your seniors as well as made Istikhara. If you did that, and decided\nthereafter, then that is not an act of pride. The future is best known by\nAllah. It is incorrect for any person to make any imperative statement\nregarding the future.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
