  "question": "How will be judged on the last day?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI read that we will be judged when the Angels tell us in front of Allah(swt) our sins and good things by showing us a photograph of these deeds. Another source which is supported by science says that time will reverse,on judgemnet day,time will go backwards, the clocks are now rotating clockwise,but on judgemnet day that will stop and they will start to rotate anti-clockwise. so everything we are doing, all our deeds which are being recorded will be played back like u would watch a video tape being rewinded. So our deeds will be repeated again,we will have no control over that and will not be able to change what we r doing while time is reversing cos its already been filmed (recorded)for example and cannot be changed\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs Muslims, we believe in the day of Qiyaamat when we will have to give an\naccount of our deeds and actions in the world. The details of how it is\nrecorded is best known to Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
