  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI would like to know if there is any substantiation or support form the quran or hadis, why a young person has\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n1-      In a Medical facet, each hair on our heads is made up of two parts:\n\n·         a shaft - the colored part we see growing out of our heads\n\n·         a root - the bottom part, which keeps the hair anchored under the scalp\n\nThe root of every strand of hair is surrounded by a tube of tissue under the skin that is called the hair follicle.  Each hair follicle contains a certain number of pigment cells. These pigment cells continuously produce a chemical called melanin that gives the growing shaft of hair its color of brown, blonde, red, and anything in between.\n\nMelanin is the same stuff that makes our skin's color fair or darker. It also helps determine whether a person will burn or tan in the sun. The dark or light color of someone's hair depends on how much melanin each hair contains.\n\nAs we get older, the pigment cells in our hair follicles gradually die. When there are fewer pigment cells in a hair follicle, that strand of hair will no longer contain as much melanin and will become a more transparent color - like gray, silver, or white - as it grows. As people continue to get older, fewer pigment cells will be around to produce melanin. Eventually, the hair will look completely gray.\n\nPeople can get gray hair at any age. Some people go gray at a young age - as early as when they are in high school or college - whereas others may be in their 30s or 40s before they see that first gray hair. How early we get gray hair may be determined by our genes.\n\n \n\n2-      We find no sole reason why a young person gets white hair in the Hadeeth. Conversely we have found an indication from the Qur’aan and Hadeeth that this may occur because of extreme trepidation and agony.\n\n \n\nAllah Ta’ala says:\n\n \n\n“Then how if ye disbelieve will ye protect yourselves upon the day which will turn children gray-headed.”  (Surah Muzzammil: Ayat 17)\n\n \n\nAbu Bakr Radhiyallahu ‘anhu said, \"O Messenger of Allah, verily your hair has turned gray.'' The Prophet replied,\n\n«شَيَّبَتْنِي هُودٌ وَالْوَاقِعَةُ وَالْمُرْسَلَاتُ وَعَمَّ يَتَسَاءَلُونَ وَإِذَا الشَّمْسُ كُوِّرَت»\n\n(Surahs Hud, Al-Waqi`ah, Al-Mursalat, `Amma Yatasa'lun [An-Naba'] and Idhash-Shamsu Kuwwirat [At-Takwir] have turned my hair gray.) In another narration he said,\n\n«هُودٌ وَأَخَوَاتُهَا»\n\nSurah Hud and its sisters... (Hadeeth in Bukhari, Muslim Shareef- Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi recorded from Ibn `Abbas Radhiyallahu ‘anhu )\n\nHowever Rasulullah (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam) said: Do not pluck out gray hair. If any believer grows a gray hair in Islam, he will have light on the Day of Resurrection. (Sufyan Rahmatullahi ‘alayhi). Yahya's Rahmatullahi ‘alayhi says: Allah will record on his behalf a good deed for it, and will blot out a sin for it. (Hadith - Abu Dawud, Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As Radhiyallahu ‘anhu)\n\nFurthermore there is a narration in Muatta of Imâm Malik (Rahmatullahi alayhi) where Sa’eed ibnul Musayyib Rahmatullahi alayhi says that Ibraheem (‘Alayhis Salaam) is the first person who saw a gray hair and he asked Allah Ta’ala about it and HE replied that it is “dignity”.\n\nIn addition the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam) advice that:  The best things with which gray hair are changed are henna and katam. ( Hadith - Abu Dawud, Narrated Abu Dharr Radhiyallahu ‘anhu)\n\nFor more Queries don’t hesitate to write back. May Allah Increase all of us in Knowledge and piety.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMl.
