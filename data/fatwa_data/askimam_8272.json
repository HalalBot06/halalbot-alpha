  "answer": "QUESTION\nOur Muslim Student Association at the University is having a lecture and dinner like every year. This year, the brothers are also showing a video that they made in which a brother is faced with his nafs and an angel. The moral of the movie is to fight your Nafs. Are such videos permissible in any of the four madhabs? please explain in detail\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPhotography is not permissible at all in Islam. This is irrespective of the motive behind it. Movies contain many un-Islamic factors, one of which is photography.\n\nThe objective, which is to fight the Nafs, cannot be achieved by merely watching a video. The Nafs has to be trained in various other ways to achieve spirituality. Some of the methods are to be always in good company, constantly listening to talks on Deen, being regular with Salaat, recitation of the Qur?aan and Dhikr of Allah together with going out in the path of Allah are all acts of worship which strengthen the Nafs and direct it towards the obedience of Allah. The Association should identify Allah-fearing Ulama to address the Association from time to time.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
