This is the first step in getting closer to Allah Ta’ala. Repent sincerely to Allah Ta’ala with a firm intention not to return to any evil. If you happen to fall in sin again don’t despair; turn again to Allah Ta’ala. Allah Ta’ala’s mercy is all encompassing. After every salah ask Allah Ta’ala to help you to leave all sins and get closer to Him. Try to always keep good company. Keep yourself engaged with the remembrance of Allah Ta’ala as the devil flees from a hearth engaged in zikr of Allah Ta’ala. Try to study the live of Nabi صلى الله عليه وسلم, his noble companion’s رضي الله تعالى عنهم and our pious predecessors.\n\n \n\nSpend your free time constructively. Once you have completed your work, try not to pass time on the net. You could also consider installing an internet content filtering programme to avoid unwanted content. Also block pop-ups etc. Avoid anything which will lead to sin.\n\n \n\nReplace whatever music files you have with the recitation of the Noble Quran and Islamic lectures.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
