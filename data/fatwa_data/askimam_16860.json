  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf a married man commit  Zina and later he realizes the mistake and honestly ask Tawba from Allah, Will he get Hur-Ul-Iyne in Janna  ?\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nInshallah, such a person will get whatever he designs for in Jannah. However, while one should look forward for Allah’s bounties in Jannah, he should also make dua to Allah to save him from the fire of Hell. He should make every possible endeavour to stay away from all such sins that lead one to the fire of Hell. Islam is like a bird with two wings. One wing represents hope and the other represents fear. Both hope and fear are important to maintain a balance in ones life. Only hope without fear leads to complacence and only fear without hope leads to despondency and despair. When a person is young, he should have more fear than hope to keep him away from sins. When he is old, he should have more hope than fear. In your casem while you hope for the hoors of Jannah, fear Jahannam and the azaab of Allah in Jahannam.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
