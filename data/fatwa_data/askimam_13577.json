  "question": "Muslims have been permitted to mary a noble woman of \"people of the book\", in the same sura, Muslims are prohibited from making friends with \"ansaar and yahood",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIn Sura al M'aida, Muslims have been permitted to mary a noble woman of \"people of the book\"\n\n \n\nBut in the same sura, Muslims are prohibited from making friends with \"ansaar and yahood\" i.e. \"people of the book\" and a wife will be a friend as well as a confidant.....Is there a contradiction in holy Koran...??? I believe there could not be but I have no explanation of this matter...Please advise...\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe wisdom behind the permissibility of marriage to specifically the Jews and Christians from amongst the Kuffar is that despite the numerous changes and innovations that are found in their religion, in 2 issues they conform totally with the Muslims; a) In the issue of the Zabeeha (slaughtered animal) of Ahlul-Kitaab, i.e. it is also their belief that an animal has to be slaughtered in the name of Allah and if the name of Allah is not taken, it is carrion, impure and Haraam, and b) The issue of marriage, i.e. to whom one is not allowed to marry in Islam the same people are prohibited in their religion as well. Also, just as witnesses and announcing is found in Islam the same way can be found in their religion. (Ma’ariful Qur’aan vol.3 pg.51)\n\nHowever, we should bear in mind that it was still the view of many Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) that Nikah to even Ahlul-Kitaab is not Jaaiz. When anybody enquired from Abdullah ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) about the validity of such a marriage, he used to say, ‘Allah Ta’ala clearly states in the Qur’aa, ‘do not marry female Mushriks until they believe’ and I do not know which is greater Shirk, ascribing partners to Allah or making Eesa (Alayhis salaam) or anybody else your Lord. Nevertheless, according to majority of the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) and Taabi’een, Nikah is permissible but due to other factors still regard it as Makrooh.\n\nWhen Hadhrat Huzayfa ibn Yamaan went to Madain, he married a Jewish lady. Hadhrat Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) received the information, he wrote a letter informing him to divorce her. Hadhrat Huzayfa wrote back enquiring whether it was Haraam for him to do so. Then Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) wrote back saying, ‘I do not say it is Haraam, however, generally such women are not pure and chaste, it is for this reason I fear that perhaps through these type of marriages, evil and immorality will enter into your families.’\n\nAnother factor to consider is that many people nowadays claim to be Christian and Jewish just by name whereas in reality they are atheists and don’t follow any religion at all. Marriage to such people is totally impermissible. In essence, nowadays, one should refrain totally from such marriages. (Ma’ariful Qur’aan vol.3 pg.62)\n\nComing back to the aspect of befriending non-Muslims, Allah Ta’ala has spoken about it in numerous Aayaats:\n\n‘O believer1 do not take my enemies and your enemies (i.e. Kuffaar) as friends that you will meet them with love… whoever has befriended them has been misguided.’ (Mumtahinah)\n\n‘O you who believe, do not take the Jews and Christians as friends, some of them are friends unto some, whoever befriends them is from amongst them.’\n\n‘Let it not be found that a nation who believe in Allah and the final days befriend those who oppose Allah and his messenger even though they be your fathers or children or brothers or relatives.’ (Mujaadalah)\n\nThe relationship between the Kuffaar and Muslims have been explained in numerous Aayaats of the noble Qur’aa, some of it in detail whilst other being concise. This has created a lot of confusion amongst the ignorant masses in that some have gone to the extreme of saying that any type of relationship with a Kaafir is impermissible even though it be to be extent of displaying good character, where as from many other Aayaat of the Qur’aan and Ahaadith and the life of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and his honourable Khulafaa display the total opposite in that they emphasised kindness and good character even to non-Muslims.\n\nHence, there seemed to be an apparent contradiction, however, this is due to a lack of understanding and research. Therefore, an explanation will be given below.\n\nThe attachment and relationship between two groups or persons has different categories or stages. The first stage is Muwaalat or love from one’s heart. This is restricted for believers only. This is in no way permissible for a non-believer.\n\nThe second stage is Muwaasaat which means kindness, well-being or care. This type of relationship is permissible even for Kuffaar with the except of Kuffaar of Darul-Harb (non-Muslim land) who have hatred for Muslims. The eighth Aayaat of Surah Mumtahina have explained it as follows:\n\n‘Allah does not prevent you from those who did not fight with you with regards to Deen and those who did not remove you from your homes that you be kind to them and be just to them.’\n\nThe third state of Mudaaraat which means an outward display of good character and friendship. This is allowed with all non-believers when the intention is to benefit them, as when they are your guests or you want to save yourself from their harm coming to you.\n\nThe fourth Aayaat is Mu’aamalaat which is to trade with, hire, etc. This too is also allowed with all non-Muslims unless by dealing with them will lead to greater harm to Muslims. It is for this reason the Fuqahaa have prohibited the selling of weapons to Kuffaar. However, all other deals are correct. To keep them as labourers or to be their employee, etc. are all permissible.
