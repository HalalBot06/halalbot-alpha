  "question": "Please explain to me that,whether time of death and birth is fix (particular) or it can be change?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease explain to me that,whether time of death and birth is fix (particular) or it can be change?If it is fix so why our Prophet Mohammad (Sallalaho alaihe wassalam) said that \"Nothing can change destiny but only pray(duaa) can change it\" so death/birth is also part of destiny.Also if birth is fix so why Hazrart Zakria (Alay salam) prophet of Allah prayed for child,as \"oh my lord give me good and kind child.certainly you hear pray\".If death time is fix so according to a quote of Hazrat Ali in which he says that \"Get up early in the morning is good for health and long life\",as it is means that life can be made longer through these world resources.\n\nAlso I want to know that if some one pray for his death,it is wrong or wright.And if one pray for shahadat so is it possible that Allah may certainly fulfill his wish,is it possible?And a man who do suicide,so if death time is particular so what is his crime than.Also little want explanation about Hazrat Khalid Bin Waleed.One of my friend said that Allah did not fulfill his pray for his shahadat,beacause he was Saif Ullah\"Sword of Allah\" and Sword of Allah dont break.But other friend said that death/type of death is fix?Certain,and it cannot cahnge with dua,whatever the condition is,so therefor he did not get shahadat.I AM SO CONFUSED PLEASE EXPLAIN IT TO ME CLEARLY.Thanks\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt seems your confusion stems from the issue of Taqdeer (destiny).\n\nTaqdeer simply refers to the perfect and absolute knowledge of Allah Ta'ala. Allah Ta'ala is perfect in His being and Attributes. He knows everything of the past and the future. This is also understood from the hadith wherein Rasulullah (S.A.W.) says that the pen (of taqdeer) has dried up upon the knowledge of Allah. Allah knowing the future of every individual is different from an individual conducting his affairs out of his own will. A human being has a free will and conducts himself according to his free will. Allah does not impose anything against the will of an individual. It is just that whatever an individual does out of his free will will be according to taqdeer as Allah's knowledge is perfect. It cannot be that the actions of an individual is against taqdeer.  \n\nThe life span of an individual is based on taqdeer. Only Allah Taala knows what is the life span of an individual and when will he die.  \n\nThe time of death is specific and does not change. Allah Taala says, when their time comes it will not be delayed or brought forward. \n\nHadhrat Ali (R.A.) advice of waking up early is merely a means of long life. Generally when a person is healthy he lives longer. But that is not the criteria. Even people with good health die young. All that is within the knowledge of Allah.\n\nSuicide is a crime and a big sin. Allah Taala knew ahead of time when the person will die and that he will die through his own action of committing suicide. To desire shahadat is virtuous and an expression of servitude Allah in. His infinite knowledge knows whether the person will get shahadat or not. Hadhrat Khalid ibn Waleed (R.A.) desired shahadat but it was not meant for him according to the knowledge of Allah. The hadith that only Duaa can change destiny is an expression of the power of duaa. Allah knows that we will make duaa for our needs and Allah will grant us our needs because of our duaa.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
