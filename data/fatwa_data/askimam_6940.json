  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaam Aleikum wa rahmatullah wa barakat. Please, answer my questions: 1. Does erection break wudu? 2. Does bleeding of small amount of blood or contents of an injury with diameter of 1-2 mm break wudu?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Erecting alone does not invalidate Wudhu.\n\n2. In principle, if blood flows to any part of the body which is compulsory to wash in Wudhu or Ghusl, then that invalidates Wudhu.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
