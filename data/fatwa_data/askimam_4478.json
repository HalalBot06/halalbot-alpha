  "question": "is anal sex out of marriage zina?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSomeone told me that one of the pre-conditions for an adultery punsiment is that there should be full intercourse and two mature male persons witnessing this.Does that imply that having an anal sex with a woman whom one is not married to is not zina?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nEvery form of pre-marital sex is haraam (strictly\nprohibited) in the Shariah.\n\nIf an unmarried person is convicted of commiting\nadultery by confession or by four witnesses against\nhim or her then he/she will be given one hundred\nlashes.\n\nIf the person is married then the punishment will\nbe Rajam (stoning to death).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
