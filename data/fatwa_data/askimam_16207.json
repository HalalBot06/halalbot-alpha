  "question": "Is it permissible to use this medical benefit facility?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. As a benefit to employees, the company I work for provides Health Insurance coverage. The company pays 66% and employees have to pay 33% annual premium to the insurance company and employees can use health benefits when they need them. Is it permissible to use this medical benifit facility?\n\n2. Same is the case for life insurance where both pays 50% annual premium to the insurance company?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf the health insurance coverage is based on a conventional scheme, it is not permissible, irrespective of the percentage of contribution from the employer and employee. It would not be permissible to subscribe to such a facility and benefit from it.\nLife insurance is also prohibited.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
