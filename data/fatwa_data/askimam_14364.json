  "question": "a thin layer sits on top. Does this wound constitute flowing and therefore break my wudu?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have an open wound that covers an area about the size of a thumb. This wound is “wet”, clear liquid is coming out of the wound but it does not flow beyond the boundaries of the wound, so a thin layer sits on top. Does this wound constitute flowing and therefore break my wudu? 2) I have put a waterproof bandage on top of it, is this fine since water cannot penetrate the bandage? 3) Am I considered an excused person (where I have to renew my wudu for every salat time) or not. 4) This is unrelated, my mother uses a glass cleaner around the house that I suspect has haram ingredients. She sprays it on the glass and then wipes it off with a paper towel. Is it enough that she wipes the substance off the glass? I find myself avoiding that glass and compelled to wash my hands if I touched that glass. She also cleans the toilet seats in this manner so I put a layer of tissue paper on top of the toilet seat. The toilet seat has light scratches on it so it is not completely smooth,  is it permissible for me to wipe it clean or must I use water, and if so what is the procedure? 5) Please make dua for me.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. According to Shariah, if a wound will be harmed by water, one may apply a bandage and Masah (passing a wet hand) will be made over the bandage. There is no need to open the bandage every time you make Wudhu. The Wudhu will only break if the liquid flows unto the skin out of the wound area. If the liquid flows and stops at the mouth of the wound, the Wudhu will not break.\n\n2. Since the cleaner is not edible, it is permissible to use.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
