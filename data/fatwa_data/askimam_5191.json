  "question": "Dream and Iman and Yakeen",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)Is there a specific time in Day/Night when dreams seen have significance? I heard that dream seen just before Tahajut time are important, is it true? 2) can Sayitan Misguide us with dreams 3) 'Fadhaail-e-Aamaal': why do many people complain about this book? Complain is that this is a ?Doeif? (weak) narrated hadith book. But, for virtues of Ammal, even weak narrated is acceptable isn?t? Does the book really contain ?Doeif? hadith? How is that so many uncountable people benefited from this book? 4) Is the time of Immam Mehdi near? 5) Who is \"Mansor\"? How is this person related to the coming of Immam Mehdi? 6)Does a born Muslim (from Muslim parents) come to duniya with Iman? or Does he has to gian it? How about Yakeen? It is born with or comes with effort? JazakAllahu Khyrun\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. While there is significance for the time of Tahajjud, it makes no%0D%0Adifference to the actual dream itself whether it was seen during the day or%0D%0Anight.%0D%0A2. It is possible. That may be determined by an expert of interpretation of%0D%0Adreams.%0D%0A3. When somebody does not like a certain work or action, then he will find%0D%0Afault with every other thing connected to it. Although this book may%0D%0Acertainly contain weak narration, however, these weak narrations can be%0D%0Aacceptable for virtues. Any person who reads the book with proper attention%0D%0Aand understanding and with a clean and open heart will attain maximum%0D%0Abenefit.%0D%0A4. Whilst various people will make various claims with regards to the%0D%0Aappearance or the birth of Mahdi, none of these can be said with absolute%0D%0Acertainty. Our work is to understand the shortness of this life.%0D%0A5. According to the understood meaning of one Hadith, Nabi (Sallallaahu%0D%0AAlayhi Wasallam) has said that, 'When Qiyaamat is close, a man will appear%0D%0Afrom someone near the cities of Bukhara and Samarqand. His name will be%0D%0AHaarith and he will be a farmer. The leader of his army will be a man by the%0D%0Aname of Mansoor. He will reinforce the affairs of the Khilaafat for the%0D%0Afamily of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) (i.e. for Mahdi) like how the%0D%0AQuraysh helped Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). It is compulsory upon%0D%0Aevery believer to assist him. The scholars have stated here with slight%0D%0Avariations that Mansoor will be the leader of the army of a man by the name%0D%0Aof Haarith who will come to assist Mahdi. (Mirqaat vol.10 pg.180)%0D%0A6. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said that every%0D%0Achild is born with Imaan. Later on, it is his parents that make him follow%0D%0Athe religion upon which they are practicing. Yaqeen is something different.%0D%0AYaqeen means to have total conviction on Allah Ta'ala and all his qualities.%0D%0ATo have firm conviction from the inner recesses of the heart that Allah Ta'%0D%0Aala Alone is the sole controller and doer of every action. This Yaqeen comes%0D%0Aafter a great amount of effort.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
