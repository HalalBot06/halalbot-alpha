  "question": "Sheikhs and my fellow students in my school think that having worldy knowledge is Jehad. In the light of Quran and hadith what do you say?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJihaad literally means to sacrifice. Therefore, the Shaykhs opinion only in\nthe literal sense is correct. The reward of that sacrifice depends on the\ngood intention of the seeker of worldly knowledge, for example, contributing\nto the propagation of Islam. However, Jihaad includes physical and monetary\nsacrifice against the Kuffaar even to the extent of placing one's life at\nrisk.\n\nGenerally, the Qur'aan and Ahaadith refers to the latter understanding of\nJihaad.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
