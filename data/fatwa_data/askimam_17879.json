  "question": "Is accepting gifts during aqiqa allowed?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs accepting gifts during aqiqa allowed?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nÂ \n\nIn principle giving and accepting gifts is recommended in Shariah. Gifting is an act which creates love and harmony. However gifting specifically at the time of Aqeeqah should not be regarded to be compulsory,such that if one does not give a gift, he is looked down upon.\n\n\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
