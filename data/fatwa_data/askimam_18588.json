  "question": "Does saying; 'Istikhara Hadith is fabricated', makes one Kafir?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDoes saying; 'Istikhara Hadith is fabricated', makes one Kafir? I said this to one person: There is no need to make istikhara but use your common sense, make dua to Allah. And do not believe that what ever you do after making dua to Allah, even after using your common sense, will always be profitable in this world. It may be or may not be. But remember that you will insha Allah get the 'Ajr' in hereafter. Allah Hafiz\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nThe procedure of making Istikhara has been proven in Hadith. However, it is not appropriate for a layman to pass judgment on the academic status of any Hadith. You should refer such issues to the Ulama who have been qualified to respond to such them. Although, your statement will not constitute Kufr, you should be careful when making utterances of this nature in the future.\n\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftāa"
