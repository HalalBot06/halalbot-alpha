  "question": "What should I do with a flat which I bought with an interest-carrying home loan? Is it permissible to pay it off as quickly as possible or should I sell it immediately to rid myself of riba?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy wife and I bought the flat that we stay in using a bond from a bank. I have since learnt the great evil that riba is. What should I do now? Some people have told me that in South Africa a bond is an evil necessity and that I should try and pay the bond off as quickly as I can. My feeling is that I should sell the flat as soon as possible and settle the bond now. What advice do you have for me?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSince this flat is your primary residence, I suggest you pay off the bond as\nquickly as possible instead of selling it.\n\nIf this is not your primary residence, sell it up and pay off the bond.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
