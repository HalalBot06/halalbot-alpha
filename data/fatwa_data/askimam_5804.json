  "question": "If a person is on life-support, and is practically dead, is his Ruh (Soul) still in his body, or has already left?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nOtherwise by deciding the time of stopping the life support, are we controlling the time of a person?s death?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If a person still has life in his body, his Rooh (soul) is still present.\n2. Death is in the hands of Allah. Withdrawal of any form of life support\nsystem is tantamount to control of life and death. It is merely regarded as\nabstinence from medical treatment.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
