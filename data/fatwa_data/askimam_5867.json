  "answer": "QUESTION\na) can women recite anything they know from the Quran (from memory) during menses? b) should women say their zuhr prayers (on friday) after the Khutba or there is no restriction? c) is it haraam to eat on a dining table with spoon/fork?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is prohibited for women to read any portion of the Qur'aan while in%0D%0Amenses, be it from memory or from Qur'aan. (Hidaaya part1 pg.64)%0D%0A2. Jumu'ah Salaat is not Fardh on a woman. Women should read Dhuhr Salat%0D%0Aduring Jumu'ah time. (Ibid pg.169)%0D%0A3. There is no Hadith prohibiting eating on a table except that it is said%0D%0Athat Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) never ate on a table. In Tirmidhi,%0D%0Ait is narrated that Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said that he never%0D%0Aeats reclining. At the table and chair, one reclines on the backrest of the%0D%0Achair. The other aspect is that one must humble oneself at the time of%0D%0Aeating and this is best expressed when sitting on the floor. Sitting on the%0D%0Afloor is, after all, the Sunnat practice of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam). Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has shown us the humility we%0D%0Ashould display when eating. Eating with the fingers shows humbleness. We%0D%0Ahumble ourselves at the time of eating showing gratitude to Allah for the%0D%0Arizq he has provided for us.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
