  "question": "Will it be permissible for me (a male) to pursue a courier in medicine?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. In Mufti Taqi Usmani?s fatwa about living in a non-Muslim country, he gave three reasons about why it would be permissible: i. oppression in Muslim country, ii. financial reasons and 3. dawah. Nowadays there are 54 Muslim countries as alterniatives to one?s native country, so do rules 1 and 2 apply, nowadays? Also can?t education be a reason to live in a non-Muslim country? 2. When becoming a medical doctor (in the UK) the following must be done: i. dissecting a dead human body (that may be of the opposite gender and unclothed) ii. pictures of the human body are examined. The previous 2 are necessities when becoming a doctor. Will it be permissible for me (a male) to pursue a courier in medicine? Can you please give evidence. Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. For educational purposes, it is permissible to reside in a non-Muslim country provided one is allowed to practise his Deen freely.\n\n2. A human body deserves utmost respect. Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] is reported to have said, ?Breaking a bone of a dead person is the same as breaking it whilst he is alive.? Hence, dissection of a human body is not permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
