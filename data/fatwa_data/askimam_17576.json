  "question": "Do i have make Ghusl after seeing urine drops",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question is regarding urine drops, after urinating a few drops comes out, do i have to make ghusal again or istinja? i was told that after wudhu i must sprinkle that area 3 times, is this correct?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nIf after making Wudhu, a few drops of urine come out, it will be necessary to wash the soiled portion and to repeat the Wudhu. There is no need to make a Gusul.\n\nSprinkling water around the private part assists in repelling the evil whispers of Shaytaan that come to a person.\n\nحدثنا مجاهد عن الحكم بن سفيان الثقفي أنه رأى رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم توضأ ثم أخذ كفا من ماء فنضح به فرجه \n\nHakam bin Sufyaan As-Saqafi (radiyallahu anhu) reports that he saw Rasulullah (salallahu alaihi wasallam) make wudhu then he took some water in his palm and sprinkled it around his private parts.\n\n \n\n(Sunan ibn Majah vol.1 pg157, Maktaba Ilmiya)\n\n(Sunan ibi Dawood pg22, HM Saeed)\n\n(I’la us Sunan vol.1 pg132, Idaratul Quraan)\n\n \n\nIf one perceives any wetness around the private parts, he could attribute that to the water. The Shaytaan will not create whispers (waswasa) in his mind.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
