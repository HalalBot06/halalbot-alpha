  "answer": "QUESTION\n \nI just wanted to know if doing LAW degree and going into LAW career allowed in Islam? Can you please provide me a detailed answer to my question as i have heard lot of people say LAW is haram career.\n \nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh.\n\n \n\nA law degree or a law career in itself is not prohibited. Yes where the law is abused to usurp others rights or to wrongfully trample on the rights of others- this is not permissible.\n\n \n\nThe law degree may be pursued to defend the rights of the innocent or to assist others in gaining what is due to them.\n\n \n\nYes, lying, deception and other such ills are prohibited regardless of the career.\n\n\n\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
