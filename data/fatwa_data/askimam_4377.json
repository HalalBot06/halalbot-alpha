  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalmualaikum, Respected Mufti Sahab, I wanted to know whether it is permissible for a wife to rub her private part to her husbands anus and reach orgasm from it? also i know that reaching orgasm in periods is not permissible but I have been reaching orgasm by doing what i mentioned before during my periods as it gets very hard to control myself, Is it a very big Gunah? and what can i do to completely stop my self from doing it? My husband does not penetrate me but i get fully satisfied by doing that, this has been bothering me very much as i have heard that one can not have sex while in periods. Please reply me as soon as you can and please do not publish this question. Also i want to know what duas to read or what zikhr to do while in periods as well as without periods in these last 10 nights of Ramadhan. What is the best way to repent in front of Allah for doing what i did? May Allah reward you and Include you among the dwellers of Jannatul Firdaus. Ameen. Jazakallah khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is sufficient that she covers herself, and thereafter be intimate. It is\nnot prohibited to reach orgasm during menses.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
