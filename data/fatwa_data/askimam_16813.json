  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni am a muslim woman from india living at afghanistan with my father and family on a charity mission where my father works. 2 month ago he told us that the local imam said to prevent woman from tempting man their mouth should be tied or stuffed with cloth or rag or rubber ball to make them silence when they went outside of home. after that my father make us..the woman folk at home to wear gag's when we went outside home. often he stuffed our mouth with rag and tape it shut tightely/ or stuff it with cloth and then tie a scarf arounmd our face , lately he using rubber ball to stuff mouth. its very painful to be under burka and then mouth tied for 7/8 hour . is there any fatwa like this is permitted?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThe ruling of the local Imam to tie the mouth of a woman is baseless. There is no such requirement in shariah. Your father has conducted himself in an irresponsible way by stuffing your mouth. The imam should be dismissed from his position as he is a jaahil misleading people.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
