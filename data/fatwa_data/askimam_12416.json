  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs my (mamoo) mother's brother considered a mehrem for my wife, and is there and source of kissing the hands of the elderly people in Islam?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. A man?s Mamoo (mother?s brother) is not a Mahram of the wife unless he is also a Mahram of the wife e.g. Mamoo, paternal uncle, grandfather, father, etc.\n\n2. The Fuqahaa (Jurist) have mentioned that it is permissible for a male to kiss a male and a female to kiss a female on the hands and the forehead at the time of reunion or bidding farewell on the basis of respect and honour. The Fuqahaa have not mentioned any distinction of elderly or young people. However this will only be permissible if there is no fear of Fitnah.
