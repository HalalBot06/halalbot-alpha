  "question": "Sir,I would like to know that does our clothes become dirty/is there a necessity to change underwear if madhi falls or sticks to them.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf clothes are soiled with Madhi which is equal or less than a Dirham coin\n(diameter of 2.75 cm), then to read Salaat with such clothes will be\nMakrooh-e-Tanzihi (undesirable). If it is more than a Dirham coin (diameter\nof 2.75 cm), then to read Salaat with such clothes will be\nMakrooh-e-Tahreemi (reprehensible). (Tahtaawi pg.125; Qazi Khan)\n\nThe soiled portion with Madhi on the body or clothes should be washed before\nperforming Salaat to avoid making the Salaat Makrooh.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
