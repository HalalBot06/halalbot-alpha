  "answer": "QUESTION\n1) Can I pray in gesture while traveling? Like the cases a) I am traveling more than 100 kilometers by bus and in the mean time the prayer time arrives. Can I just pray in gesture on sitting just to show Allah that I remembered in whatever condition I am in? Do I need to repeat the prayer? Actually what am I supposed to do in such case? b) What should I do if I am traveling for around 30 km and I am afraid that I might miss the salaat by the time I get down. Should I pray in gesture in the train?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, it is not permissible to perform Fardh Salaat while traveling on a conveyance. (Hidaaya vol.1 pg.130; Rashidiyyah). However, if a person fears that the time of this Salaat will pass out, he should perform it while on the conveyance and thereafter repeat the Salaat.\n\nIn conclusion, traveling by train, there is a possibility of standing and performing Salat. Therefore, Salaat should be performed standing. However, if due to place constraints the abovementioned procedure should be adopted.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
