  "answer": "QUESTION\nFist of all i would like to thank you for reading this mail and for your precious time which you will be spending over my question. I have heard that when the angel Gibraeel took Rasool Allah(SAWL) with him during the Shab of Meraaj, at one point he asked Rasool Allah(SAWL) to proceed on his own as he cannot accompany him further and that he will be burned down if he proceeds further and that no prophet has crossed that point at which he will be leaving Rasool Allah(SAWL). I also came to know that the place at which the angel Gibraeel left Rasool Allah(SAWL) was near a mosque. My question is how far I am right and if I am right, then could you clarify me as to why the angel said that he would be burned and he cannot go further?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe place where Jibraaeel (Alayhis salaam) left Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi\nWasallam) is called the Sidratul Muntahaa which has been interrupted to be\nsome type of a huge tree with gold leaves of a very large nature. This is\nthe place where the knowledge of every creation terminates. Only Allah Alone\nknows what's after that. The 'mosque' that you are referring to is probably\nthe Baytul Ma'moor. This is situated directly above the Ka'abah on the\nseventh heaven. It is around this that thousands of angels worship Allah Ta'\nala daily.\n\nWith regards to Jibraaeel (Alayhis salaam) saying that 'he will get burnt',\netc. this does not appear in any authentic narration. In fact, this is a lie\nand a fabrication, hence, we should also abstain from believing in this.\n(Sharh zarqaani vol.8 pg.200)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
