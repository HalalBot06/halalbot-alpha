  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was wondering two things. 1) Has any scholar in the past or present gone through Ihya 'Uloom al-Deen and verified they hadith? so we know which is Sahih or Da'eef? 2) Who exactly was Jalaluddin ar-Rumi? would u suggest ppl to read his writings? 3)What is the ruling in joining Tareeqas? Is this not classified as bid'a?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Yes, this has been done by various Muhadditheen of the past. The most renowned is the work of Hafiz Zaynud-deen al-Iraqi (RA), Ustaadh of Hafiz ibn Hajar al-Asqalaaniy (RA). This work is known as ?Almughni an hamlil asfaar fil asfaar?. It is published in Arabic and quite freely available. Another is the work of Allaamah Murtadaa Zabidi (RA) knows as ?Ittihaaf saadatil muttaqeen? also published in Arabic.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Shaykh Jalaaluddin Rumi (RA) was a very respected spiritual mentor of his time and is still respected upto this day. It is believed that he had reached very high spiritual levels. His mentor, Shamsuddin Tabrizi, was also the mentor of ibn Aabideen al-Shaami (the famous Hanafi theologian). Shaykh Jalaaluddin Rumi?s (RA) works may be read with a condition that the reader must understand the contect that the Shaykh speaks in.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. There is no harm in joining those Tareeqas that are according to Sunnah.

Irrespective of the name attributed to them, they are still members of the Ahlus sunnah Wal Jamaa. The Tareeqahs we follow are basically pathways en-route to our spiritual enhancement. They may be termed as a good Bid?at just like a number of other newly construed mediums of Deen. The Madaaris for instance."
