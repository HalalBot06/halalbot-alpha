  "question": "What are the books/works of the 4 imams, and other books about the madhahib...I'm interested in learning about the 4 different madhahib, and learn the views of the imams' on fiqh issues",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI'm interested in learning about the 4 different madhahib, and learn the views of the imams' on fiqh issues so that, inshaAllah, I can eventually decide which madhab to adopt. I have absolutely no knowledge of them. I asked my mom if she or my dad followed a madhab, but they don't, and she said \"I think Egyptians are mostly Hanafi.\" Unlike Islam, I don't think you get born into a madhab... perhaps you are raised with certain practices that relate to a specific madhab, but if you don't consciously know, then you are free to choose one, correct? If possible, could you provide me with the name of the books/works that each of the 4 imams are known for, that contain their views so I can compare them? Please list their names in Arabic, and also, if possible, if there are any that have been translated into English. Also, if you could name any English books that provide a comparison of the madhahib I'd appreciate it. Lastly, should one wait for a certain period of time until they reach a \"level\" of religiousness before bothering with following a madhab? Some people I know tell me they don't want to bother themselves with madhahib until they've read the Qur'an, understood it's tafsir, read fiqh-us-sunnah, and the Bukhari ahadeeth... please advise.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOne of the wisdom of following one particular Madhab is convenience. It is difficult for every person to study all the different opinions on every issue. Consider just one example, in Salaat, there are differences of opinions on, %0D%0Aa) What can one recite when commencing Salaat besides saying Allaah Akbar. In this these are approximately three opinions and each opinion is well substantiated, %0D%0Ab) Where should the hands be raised? Till the earlobes or till the shoulders (differences of opinions)%0D%0Ac) What should one recite after tying the hands ? Thanaa or Qiraat (differences of opinions)%0D%0Ad) When going into Ruku and coming up from Ruku, raising the hands (differences of opinion)%0D%0Ae) Pausing in Qawma, it is compulsory or not?%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the above mentioned differences, there are approximately 15 different opinions and each opinion is well-substantiated from an academic point of view. It is generally difficult for you to examine all the Madhabs without sacrificing a few years of your life to study Arabic, Usoolul Fiqh, Fiqh, Ahaadith, Tafseer, etc. Each one of these subjects are necessary to understand the substantiations offered by the jurists in their academic discussion. We have cited only a few differences in one Rakaat of Salaat not the entire Salaat. Obviously, Salaat is preceded by Wudhu, there are also differences of opinions in Wudhu, Ghusl and almost every other issue which may run to hundreds if not thousands. The substantiations are certainly to run into thousands.%0D%0A%0D%0AWould you have time to study all the substantiations and if you do, what criteria will you adopt in deducing who is right and who is wrong. You may even end up with a mixture of rulings of different Madhabs, thus complicating the matter for yourself. Instead of all that, why not choose only one Madhab, place your confidence in the knowledge of the Imaam of that Madhab and strictly adhere by that. Insha Allah, you will still be following the Shari?ah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
