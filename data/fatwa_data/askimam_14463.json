  "question": "isal-e-sawab can also be made to the alive along with the dead. Is this view correct?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI read in a book written by mufti abdur rauf that isal-e-sawab can also be made to the alive along with the dead. Is this view correct?\n\nI know that isal-e-sawab is proven through ahadith. Can you please explain me the logic of allowing dead people to continue getting rewards although their time in this world is over. Doesn't this concept go against 'what you sow is what you ripe'? For eg a person may send the rewards of reciting the whole quran every day to his whole family or to all the Muslims passed away.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is permissible to send Isal-e-Sawaab (passing of reward) for the alive and the dead. Almighty Allah has favoured us through accepting Isaal-e-Sawaab. In principle, a person should be rewarded only for his own deeds and actions. However, as human beings, Allah has put in us the feelings for one another. We feel for our deceased parents, family and friends. Allah has thus permitted us to do good deeds and pass the reward to them.\n\nFurthermore, the deceased must have done something good to the living person for him/her to be remembered. When the living person does a good deed and passes the reward to the deceased, the deceased is indirectly drawing from his own actions.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
