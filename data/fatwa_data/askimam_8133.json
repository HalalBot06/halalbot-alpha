  "answer": "QUESTION\nI had a dream where someone had come and told me that my fiancé had donated money to a good cause and I was very pleased with him and happy.is this a good dream?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAt the outset, we wish to state that it is not permissible to have any relationship with a Ghayr Mahram (not prohibited in marriage) male outside of marriage.\n\nIt is possible that Shaytaan wishes to advance this illegitimate bond through such convincing dreams. Do not be deceived.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
