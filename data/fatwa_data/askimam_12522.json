  "answer": "QUESTION\n1.First will be Nikka 2.Joint Mendhi will be done from both sides after a week 3.The following day, Joint Wedding Ceremony will be done. This is where the Ruxatee (when the bride goes to her husband home for the first time) will take place too We will not have walima. Is the above scheduled events Islamic justified? Do we still need to have a Walima. A lot of my relatives are saying that we should still have a walima done. I reply back by saying that since we will be doing a joint reception, there is no need for a walima Thank -you\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe ceremonies of Mehndi and Rukhsati as described by you are purely customs of the Indian Hindus that have seeped into us Muslims due to our prolonged interaction with them. In Islam, a wedding is a simple affair. The elaborate frills accompanying today?s Muslim weddings are based on sheer ostentation or in emulation of the disbelievers. Such weddings are a waste of hard earned money. Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] is reported to have said, ?The Nikah that incurs the least expenditure draws the most blessings.?%0D%0A%0D%0AOur advice to you would be as follows:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Have the in the Musjid.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Have a Waleemah after the couple has met in complete privacy. This could be on the same day or the day after. Waleemah is Sunnah.%0D%0A%0D%0ABear in mind that you would be on the receiving end of a lot of criticism from members of your family for opting for a simple ceremony. Rather bear their criticism stoically for a few days and draw the blessing of Allah instead of drawing His wrath for the rest of the marriage.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Muhammad Kadwa%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0Achecked & approved by: mUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)%0D%0A"
