  "question": "The sunnah of wearing long kurta and its proof.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDear Mufi Sahib, I am imam of a masjid in Australia and someone asked me that what is the proof of wearing the long kurta that the Arabs wear and the other kurta that the indians wear in the Shafii point of view. If you mention any kitaabs please state the bab (chapter) wherer that hadith is mentioned. Allah reward you for your efforts.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nDue to every country having different climates and the Shariat of Islaam is\nuniversal in Nature. Then to state that this or that particular dress in\nonly the Sunnat, how will a Muslim in winter in Russia dress and how will\nthe Muslim in summer dress in Saudi Arabia. So one form of dress will be\ncondusive for one area in ine season but not good for another area in\nanother season. Whereas our claim is Islaam is for all time, for ever place,\nfor all people, for all conditions, for every nook and cranny of the world.\nIn the light of the Hadith, Nabi (S.A.W) wore a Kurta, a shawl, a hat, a\nturban, alungi and even a trouser when it was presented to him. For a very\nhealthy discussion see Shaamil Tirmidhi which has the commentary of Sheikh\nMuhammad Zakariyya (A.R) and the booklet “Kurta, Topee, Turban”\nby Moulana Fazlur Rahmaan Aazimi . Thus the Ulema has after studying the\nShariat (i.e. the various Ahadith etc. formulated by some principles :\n1.) Should be loose fiting, no attractive part of the body should be made\nout ;\n2.) The basic are (aura) must be covered, area between the Naval to below\nthe knee ;\n3.) The garment, especially the trouser must be above the ankles ;\n4.) The garment should be preferably white ;\n5.) The garment has horizontal and verticalthread to make up the fabric,\nboth these threads must not be red or yellow ;\n6.) The garment must not be made of silk for men, it can only be used under\nspecial circumstances ;\n7.) The garment must be purchased from Halaal earnings ;\n8.) It should be a mean of decorating the body, within the limits of\nShariah.\n9.) It should not resemble the dress of non- muslimsd ;\n10.) It should not create pride and arrogance in a person.\n\nOne should know that Nabi (S.A.W) wore a garment worth 2000 dinars. Whilst\nImaam Maalik (A.R) used to wear new clothing daily.\n\n11.) The muslim must avoid following the fashion of the day. Know also that\nthe Nabi also wore green. Pride can also be caused by wearing simple, coarse\nclothing. The person in his heart wil lfeel, ‘look how pious I am’.\n12.) Men should not don the specialised dress of women, at times non-muslims\nwore dresses/garments which have no religious significance in their\nreligion, then without detestment Muslims may wear such clothing.\nSome times non- muslims wear a particular garment in one area as a religious\nfeature or mark, but that very same dress in another area is not worn with\nthat connotation, then to wear that garment in one area will be permissable\nand in the other area not – permissable.\n\nHowever, while it is possible to wear the Kurta then one should do so.\n\nAs a rule , the Ulema have found that in any area, the layman should abserve\nthe dress of the reliable, pious, righteous, practical Ulema – e- Rabbani\nHaqqani of that area, then imitate these Ulema. This is closest to the\nSunnat. One will not expect any Aalim, to have no beard, wearing a tie,\nhaving trousers below the ankles, with no hat let alone a turban on the head\nprojecting piety.\n\nThe Ulema who have understood the Deen will dress in such a method which\nwill be nearesst to the Sunnat.\n\nThus to say the Kurta is not the Sunnat dress is not valid and also to state\nthat the Kurta is only the Sunnat dress is also not correct."
