  "question": "Q : If a wife agrees to stay with her inlaws at the time of marriage, does that mean she never gets the right to run her house. What if the inlaws stay with them even after the couple",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf a wife agrees to stay with her inlaws at the time of marriage, does that mean she never gets the right to run her house. What if the inlaws stay with them even after the couple get their own house. What if the mother in law is the one who is makes all the decisions, when does the wife get her right then?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIndeed, the rights of one’s parents are greater than one’s wife. However, that does not mean that one should neglect his wife and give preference to his parents over the wife in every aspect of life. Nabi karīm sallallāhu ῾alayhi wasallam  has taught us to be just and treat ones parents according to their status. In the same way, one should fulfill the rights right of a wife. Nevertheless, the wife should also understand that her success lies in the happiness of her husband. If the husband is fulfilling her needs and not violating her rights in any way, then there is no harm in keeping the parents with them. The parents should also look after their daughter-in-law as their own child and not interfere with her life unnecessarily. However in our times, the preferred and emphasized view of our esteemed scholars is for one to arrange a separate accommodation for their children once they are married. If this method is adopted much more love and affection amongst the family will be created.\n\nForgive each other and abstain from reminding each other of their rights. We make du῾ā to Allāh jalla jalāluhu that He grants us the true understanding  of dīn and grant us taufeeq to practice upon it. Āmīn\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\nMl.
