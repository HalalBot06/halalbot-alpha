  "question": "can I take a Home Loan? Will Shariah allow to take a Loan on interest in this kind of circumstances?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am a Computer Engineer from India. I pay around Rs. 3000 per month to Govt. as an Income Tax on my salary. I have not taken any LIC policy or loan. The best way to save the Tax is by taking the Home Loan, as I can save the tax on both interest as well as Principal amount that I pay every month.\n\nEverybody, including my parents suggesting me to take a Home Loan, so that I can save the Tax and also invest my money on building a house for us. I know that taking money on interest is not allowed in Islam.\n\nIf I do not take a Loan, I need to pay the Income Tax (Rs. 3000 per month) and also, I cannot afford to construct a house, as I do not have that much amount with me.\n\nKeeping the above mentioned things in consideration, can I take a Home Loan? Will Shariah allow to take a Loan on interest in this kind of circumstances?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIrrespective of what you can save by indulging in a Haraam transaction, payment of interest, etc. you will subject yourself to is Haraam. A homeloan for purposes of tax benefits is a lame excuse to indulge in something as serious as interest.\n\nOur suggestion is that you search for an Islamic bank or any bank that is prepared to structure a deal for you according to Islamic principles. Such a deal will protect you from interest whilst offering you tax advantages at the same time.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
