  "question": "Must I keep 60 penalty fasts for each saum of Ramadan that I violated, or Do I make qadah of each one?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen I was a teenager I use to have lustful thoughts during Ramadan which caused excitement therefore nullifying my fasts. How do I make up for these? I know the punishement for breaking even one fast is fasting for two months continuously. What do I do in my case? I probably violated most of the fasts for every Ramadan over a period of many years. I am so ashamed of myself and I DESPERATELY NEED TO FIND OUT HOW TO MAKE UP FOR THESE FASTS OF RAMADAN. #2) Also, if after marriage I violated a fast by passionate kissing or touching of private parts but not intercourse, how do I do the penalty for that kind of violation of my fast?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKaffaarah (fasting for two months continuously) has to be given only if you have sexual relations interntionally in one of the private parts.\n\nIf you had an ejaculation through kissing, thoughts, touching, etc. then Qadhaa has to be made of that fast only and no Kaffaarah has to be kept. Therefore you should try and recall how many fasts you had broken and in whuich way and accordingly compensate.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
