  "answer": "QUESTION\n\none of my near frelatives had no issue after marriage. Therefore, they adopted a girl from a hospital, whose parents names were not known. So far due to necessity of life, they have given their own names as father and mother.\n\nShe has been brought up by them as their real daughter. Now she has grown up and they are worried as the Quranic orders are quite clear. What should they do at the time of her marriage\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to Shariah, your relatives will be the guardian of the adopted girl. A guardian may also arrange for the child’s marriage and such a Nikah is valid.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
