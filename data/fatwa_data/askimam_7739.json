  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)I am 17,I have been in the work of Dawah & Tabligh for the past year.Since then my parents and relatives see me as extreme as I practice on many Sunnah and Ahadith.If parents tell me not to practice on these Sunnah should I stop?For example,give up eating on floor and eat on table?What if they tell me to do haraam?2)Is there a remedy where I can be the one to listen to my parents and do what they say,anything to pray?3)I read an answer on the website ?brother in law is death? what is meant by this?I think it is a Hadith could you explain please?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Allah Ta?ala has forbidden us to obey our parents in those acts that contradict the Qur?aan and Sunnah teachings. Hence, we should advise them with Hikmah (wisdom) in this regard and abstain from obeying them in those acts that contradict the Qur?aan and Sunnah.\n\n2. You should make constant Du?aa for them, make their Khidmat (service) and continue advising them with Hikmat (wisdom).\n\n3. The Hadith, ?Brother-in-law is death?. Due to the brother-in-law being allowed always excess, entrance to the home freely, the sister-in-law (who is not his Mahram) should be very cautious in regard to him. How a person is on his guard and wary about death, similarly, should she be about her brother-in-law.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
