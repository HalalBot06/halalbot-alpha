  "question": "I recently learnt that i have been praying fard wrongly. after the first two rakah I did not know that you do not read a surah after surah fatiha. does this invalidate all my fard salaat.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\ni was very upset to learn that i have been praying fard incorrectly. i have been praying regularly for several years now and kazah salaat also after each prayer. please advice me if i should read kazah for all my fard salaats.thank you\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is no Surah to be recited after Surah Faatiha in the third and fourth Rakaats of Fardh Salaat.\n\nHowever, if one is recited a Surah, that does not invalidate the Salaat. Therefore, your previous Fardh Salaats are valid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
