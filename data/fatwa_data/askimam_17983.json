  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan a non muslim girl convert to Islam on the day of her Nikaah?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIslam is a perfect religion; a religion for all people and for all times. It is divinely protected by Allah Ta’ala Himself. Islam is a means for a person’s eternal salvation. We pray to Allah Ta’ala to guide and assist you. Ameen.\n\nA person should not delay in accepting Islam. One should embrace Islam at the first available opportunity.\n\nAccepting Islam wholeheartedly makes it easier for a person to learn and practice the teaching of shariah. It will also aid in a person remaining steadfast on his religion.\n\nActions are based on intentions. By being true to yourself and accepting with full conviction that Islam is the only true religion, one will not only gain his objective of marriage but will also reap its benefits in both worlds.\n\nRegarding your query, it is permissible for a person to embrace Islam on his/her marriage day. However, one should not embrace Islam for marriage only. One should be sincere and accept Islam sincerely.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl. Ishaq E.
