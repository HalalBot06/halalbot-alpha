(In the name of Allah, I place my trust on Allah. O Allah! Indeed, I seek refuge in you for that I misguide anyone or that I become misguided or that I force others to err or that I be forced to do so, or that I oppress or become oppressed or I act ignorantly or any act of ignoranc be carried out on me).

(Sunan ibn Majah Hadith778; Musnad Ahmad vol.3 pg.21)%0D%0A%0D%0AThis Hadith has been classified as Hasan (soundly authentic) by several Muhadditheen, viz.
