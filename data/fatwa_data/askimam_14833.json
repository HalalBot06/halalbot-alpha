  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nHello Imam, I have a habit of talking too much. Its bad, I hurt people's feelings and also say bad stuff about other people like ghibat. I really need a dua or Surah to read. How can I prevent this bad habit because of this talkative habit people are not friends with me and say stuff about me. Please tell me some dua or surah to prevent this from happening . I make niyat not to repeat and it still happens thank you.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\n\nAllah subhânahu wa ta'âla says, “O you who believe, Fear Allah and say that which is straight.”\n\nTaqwa and fear for Allah is a force to control ones tongue. A person who does not has fear for Allah subhânahu wa ta'âla is lose with his tongue.\n\nRasulullah sallallahu `alayhi wassalam said that many inmates of Jahannam (fire of hell) will be due to abusing their tongues.\n\nGheebat (backbiting), lies etc are sins of the tongue and expressly prohibited in the Quran.They are sins that incur the anger and wrath of Allah subhânahu wa ta'âla. How can an honest and dedicated believer indulge in such sins knowing that he is engaged in the anger of Allah subhânahu wa ta'âla.\n\nAn intelligent person’s mind is before his tongue. He thinks and ponders before he speaks. It is a sign of stupidity to talk before thinking and pondering. The harms of the tongue are so many to mention.\n\nIt is upon you to control your tongue. You should exercise restraint. Talk when there is need. If you have to talk, don’t engage in any sinful talk. Apart from making an effort to control your tongue, make this dua’.\n\nAllahumma Saddid Qalbiee Wa Saddid Lisaani\n\nOh Allah (subhânahu wa ta'âla) straighten my heart and straighten my tongue.\n\nBear in mind that only dua’ is not sufficient. An effort with the dua’ will show the efforts of the dua’\n\n\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
