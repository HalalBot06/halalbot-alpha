  "answer": "QUESTION\nI know that for a woman to apply henna to her palms and nails is recommended by the Prophet (saw), so as to differentiate between a male and a female hand. But my question is, is it also ok to apply the henna in the form of (non-animate) patterns and shapes, which is a common and popular practice nowadays, or should there be no design at all? Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for a woman to decorate her hands with henna. To decorate her hands and expose it in front of strange men will not be permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
