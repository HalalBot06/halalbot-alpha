  "question": "I have lost one child during birth and another due to a miscarriage. Wasthere supposed to be Janaaza Salaat in these situations and will the children intercede for me on the day of Qiyaamat?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the Shariah, when a child passes away in the womb of the\nmother or dies before the head and the chest comes out in a normal birth, or\nbefore the abdomen (navel) comes out in a breach birth, it is regarded as\nstill born. (Tahtawi Page 327 Qadeemi)\nThe still born child should be washed, given a name, placed in a cloth and\nbe buried in the graveyard. The same rule applies in a miscarriage and some\nlimbs of the child are visible. (Ibid) It is hoped that such a child will\nintercede for the parents on the day of judgement. There is no Janaaza\nSalaat for a still born child. (Ibid)\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best.\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
