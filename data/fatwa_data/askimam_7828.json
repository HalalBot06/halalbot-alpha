  "question": "Getting kicked from Islam equals fast invalidation? I read that a look with passion while fasting destroys the fast. You said it doesn't...",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI recently asked a question about looking at girls while fasting and would first like to thank you for that. Jazakum Allahu khayran. But I read that a look with passion while fasting destroys the fast. You said it doesn't. Does the narraration I read talk about only it's(the fast's) value in reward and it doesn't make it(the fast) invalid? Lastly, another question I asked may have been written badly. I meant to ask that If I'm fasting and get kicked from Islam then make shahada, does my fast become invalid? I'm sorry for the mistake. Jazakum Allah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Yes, the narration refers to the reward being destroyed, not the validity of the fast.\n\n2. Kindly elaborate.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
