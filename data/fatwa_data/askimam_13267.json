  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n\"Obtaining ILM is Compulsory to every muslim man and women\"plz explain,what ilm?(2)Is to cover hair and face includes in Parda(HIJAB)for women?(3)Can women cut her hairs like man,what is the limit?\n\nAsslam o alaikum respected Mufti Sahib...please give me the answers according to Quran and Hadis Jazakallah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘Obtaining Ilm is compulsory on every Muslim.’ (Mishkaat pg.34). Ilm refers to Ilm Shari’ah (knowledge of the laws of Deen). Therefore, it is incumbent on every Muslim to acquire that knowledge that he is related to, e.g. a person has to know the laws of Salaat before performing Salaat. Similarly, when a person has wealth, then it becomes incumbent on him to learn the laws of Zakaat, etc. Likewise, when he wants to do business, get married, etc. then it is compulsory on him to learn the laws of Shari’ah related to the subject. (Mirqah vol.1 pg.434)\n\n2. Q: Is it permissible for strange males and females to look at each other? Also what is the basis of the veil?\n\nA: Allah Taãla mentions in the Noble Qur’an, ‘(O Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), tell the believing males to lower their gazes… tell the believing females to lower their gazes ...’ (Quran 24:29-30). The injunction of lowering the gaze is clear that it is not permissible for strange males and females to look at one another. Due to the immorality of times and weakness of resistance, it is compulsory for a female to cover her face which is the focus of her beauty. The covering of the face conveniently facilitates the accomplishment of the purpose of lowering the gaze.\n\n3. The ruling of our Darul Ifta has always been that generally it is prohibited for females to trim their hair. (Al-Mahmood pg.173)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
