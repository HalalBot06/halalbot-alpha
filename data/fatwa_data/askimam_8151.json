  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am in canada, I don't want to have sex that against Islam, Can Marry I girl just to not commit a sin. While every thing has explained to the girl and she is agree upon. And also we want to keep the Nikah secret.2.) is it not better than Zina Also please let me know if I can read my Nikah by myself while the witness are on Internet. Please give the Short reply as soon as possible\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo commit Zina is Haraam (strictly prohibited) and a major sin. It incurs the wrath of Allah upon the adulterer. It is also important to understand that Nikah should not be performed to merely fulfil one?s sexual desires. There are many other responsibilities that come along with Nikah.\n\nIt is, therefore, very important to exercise precaution before commiting to Nikah. In the meanwhile, you should control your desires by fasting. Also abstain from anything that may increase your desires. In brief, it is not appropriate to offer a straight forward answer to your question ?performing secret Nikah better than Zinah?. The answer to your question should be understood in light of the above explanation.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
