  "question": "Can I use that money to buy Halal gifts for relatives and close family?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nQ.1 Every month I take out some from my salary as \"Lillah\". When I take out , I don't have any particular niyat. Can I use that money to buy Halal gifts for relatives and close family. In particular, my brothers, sisters and their spouses and their children and my parents and my in-laws.\n\n \nQ.2 My kids go to Saudi Local schools. Almost all of the books contain verses from Quran and Hadith of Nabi (saw). Now we have so many school books from last four years for every kid. What we should do with these books. There is no system here to be taken care for books like these. I have seen here the local people just throw these book outside or close to charity boxes. But even charity groups also throw them away.  Let me know what we should do with these books. Some mufti told me put them in sea (beach). But I fear, if I do this they might come back to ground by waves or when water goes away during last days of moon, they might re-surface. Can these be shredded ? I saw some local people doing that. I think the logic in cutting/shredding they have is that: when the haroof will be separated, they will be just like \"alaff, baa, jeem\" and no more like \"Allah, Raab\" etc. What Should I do with these books?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1. Yes, it will be permissible to use the money taken out as “lillah” to buy gifts for ones family and relatives.\n\n2. School books containing Quranic verses or Ahadith could be given away to students of the lower grades, friends, poor or donated to the school. As far as possible, Islamic literature should not be destroyed. However if after exhausting efforts, one is compelled to do so, then these literatures could be buried or placed in flowing water. The Fuqahaa prefer that it be buried.
