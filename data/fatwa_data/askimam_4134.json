  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamualaikum wa Rahmatullah, a while back i had a dream, first you have to understand that this dream was a very serious dream to me. I was sitting on a rough floor, it seemed like desert land but it was not all sand it was partly rocks/stones. I was sitting with other muslim brothers and I was old, I had a long beard and a turban on, all the brothers looked like that. We were sitting waiting for the Prophet (saw) to come. It felt as though we had just come back from a jihad or an expedition. After some time I was thinking and waiting at what an opportunity I am having in being able to mee the Beloved (saw). An announcement was made that He was coming, when I heard it, I began to weep profusely. I heard footsteps, then all of a sudden I began to think, and I realised that it was not the Prophet because he had already passed away. When I realised this I woke up and didnt get to see who it was. I woke up and my pillow was wet and my face still had tears streaming down. What does this mean ? Who was that man we were waiting for ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'The prophets of Allah are\nalive in their graves.'\n\nIn view of the above quoted Hadith, it is the belief of the Ahlus Sunnah Wal\nJamaa` that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) passed away from this\nearthly life only. We advise you increase your Durood and salaams (blessings\nand salutations) upon Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and make Du'\naa to Allah Ta'ala to bless you as well as me with the love and vision of\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
