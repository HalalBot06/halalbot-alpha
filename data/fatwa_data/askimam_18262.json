  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nRE : FATWA # 18138\n\nJazzakallah for your reply and inshallah should Allah bless us with children we will try our level best to make them Hafiz and Alim.\n\n1. My question is still unanswered as I am unsure if there is more virtue to have my Nikkah in such a blessed place. I read that praying 1 Namaz in Makkah Haram Sharif you get reward of 100,000 and praying in Madina, in Masjid Nabawi you get 50,000. Is there any virtue in having your Nikkah performed in such a blessed place. I did not go there with the intention of getting married, so that rules out the fact that I did not waste money to go all the way there to simply do my Nikah, in fact I had no intention of doin my Nikah what so ever, everything just happend and it felt right.\n\n2. Also another question I have is in reagards to Wudhu. Does one's wudhu break should he/she accidently look at a male or females legs, above the knee. As sometimes where walking to the mosque people wear clothes that do not cover what muslims would deem unlawful. Would this require a fresh wudhu. Or Say for example you are in the mosque, and a fellow brothe ris wearing a very short tshirt or top, and while sitting there lower back is revelave which is part of the satar, will this require a fresh wudhu by the person who has accidently seen this?\n \nJazakallah in advance\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n1. We are not aware of any special reward of having ones nikah done in the Masjid Nabawi.\n\n \n\n2. Looking at someone’s awrah does not necessitates a fresh wudu. However, if one looked at someone’s awrah intentionally or committed some other sin, then it will be preferable to make fresh wudu, as it is a means of cleansing sins.\n\n \n\nقال في نور الإيضاح: الوضوء على ثلاثة أقسام ... والثالث: مندوب، للنوم على طهارة واذا استيقظ منه وللمداومة عليه وللوضوء على الوضوء وبعد غيبة وكذب ونميمة وكل خطيئة الخ ؛ وقال في إمداد الفتاح: لأن الوضوء يكفر الذنوب ( إمداد الفتاح ص 81-82 ط الغوثاني )\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl.
