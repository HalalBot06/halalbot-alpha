  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am going to marry a woman to get a citizenship of the country. Her interest in marriage is, I reward her with money and plus I have to sleep with her. My question is am I allowed to sleep with her as I am not going to marry her for real?\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh  \n\n \n\nIt is incorrect for you to marry a woman with the sole intention to receive citizenship of a country. Islam does not advocate such marriages, as they are generally temporary and provisional. These marriages are engineered to advance other agendas and are not performed with the intent to be permanent. You cannot simply ‘marry’ a woman, reward her with money and get to sleep with her. This is not the true spirit of marriage and Islam does not advocate this type of marriage.\n\nYes, if your marriage with a woman of another country is genuine and you intend a permanent marriage, then it will be permissible for you to marry her. The citizenship you will receive will be a bonus.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
