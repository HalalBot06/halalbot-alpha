  "question": "what is the difference in asking Ambiya (AS) or a pious saint directly or indirectly, please give an example of each? Why adopt this method instead of beseeching Allah SWT directly?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI understand that it is haraam to pray salat in a place were their is a tomb or a grave of a pious saint or not, a tomb is a tomb this in my understanding with the exception of Ambiya (AS), I also understand that salat is fasid in these places. I am not worried as much about myself committing shirk or kufr, I am worried about praying in these places and having my salat be fasid. Would it be better for me to offer salat outside of masjids were there are graves or tombs? In the light of Quran and Hadith can you explain why it is okay to pray at tombs? Also can you elaborate on question 6880, what is the difference in asking a Ambiya (AS) or a pious saint (RA) directly or indirectly, please give an example of each in light of the Quran and Hadith? Why adopt this method instead of beseeching Allah SWT directly? Also I have heard that the burial places of Musa and Nuh (AS) are in Jordan or Syria, is this true?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Salaat in a Musjid that has the grave of a pious person in it is valid. However, it is Makrooh (reprehensible) to face towards the grave and perform the Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Allah Ta?ala is the sole giver and provider. Hence, we cannot ask of any of our needs from any of his creation. We are only allowed to ask from Allah Ta?ala. This could be done directly by asking Allah Ta?ala to fulfil such and such a need of mine or indirectly by using the means of some good action or person to ask from Allah Ta?ala. This type of Du?aa is proven through Ahaadith of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), e.g. Hadhrat Uthmaan ibn Hunayf (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that a blind person came to Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and requested to make Du?aa that he cures me. Then he is said if you wish I would delay and that is good but if you wish I will pray (now). The the blind said make the Du?aa: Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) commanded commanded him to make Wudhu properly and then to perform 2 Rajaats and make this Du?aa: O Allah! I ask of you and turn towards you through Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), the Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) of mercy. O Muhammad, I have turned through you to my Lord with regards to my needs so that it may be fulfilled. O Allah accept his intercession on my behalf. (ibn Majah 99)%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Mulla Ali Qari (RA) has mentioned in his Kitaab al-Masnoo (pg.229) that it is not correct to specify the Qabr (grave) of any Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) besides the Qarb of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). However, the grave of Hadhrat Ibraahim (Alayhis salaam) is in the vicinity of area known as Khalil with no exact location.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
