  "question": "U had stated (q5244) that Ibn Abdul Wahhab didnâ€™t start a new sect. How can he and his followers be regarded as Ahl Sunnah after everything above, and when many scholars have said they are Ahl Bida?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHowever, Imam Ibn Abidin (d.1252AH) says in his book, Hashiya radd al-muhtar ?ala al-Durr al-mukhtar sharh Tanwir al-absar, that the Wahhabis were considered as Khwarij. This is because they rebelled against the Caliph and started killing Sunnis, just because they thought that by practising tawassul, the people were actually worshipping the Prophet (aleyhi salam). Even today, their now dead propagandists were spreading Wahhabism, such as Albani and Uthaymin. They regard the Asharis as the same as the Jahmiyya. They say that Allahu Ta?ala is sitting ?in person? on the throne (Muslim?s Belief, by Uthaymin), even though Ibn Jawzi (d.597AH) rejected such statements as ?sitting on the throne in person? as heresy in his book, Daf? shubah al-tashbih bi akaff al-tanzih. Uthaymin also states in his book that Allah has 2 eyes! Also is it not true that Ibn Hajar Haytami (d.974AH) stated in his Fatawa al-hadithiyya that the Sunnis are the Ashari/Maturidis, whereas the Wahhabis condemn Ashari/Maturidi beliefs because we do not ascribe direction to Allah. What about the Ahadith of the dissension from the Najd by a group of muslims who shave their heads (Khwarij never did this, Wahhabis were the first to practise this) and regard other muslims as mushrikeen.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhile+the+present+day+Salafis+are+corrupt,+it+would+not+be+just+to+attribute%0D%0Atheir+views+to+ibn+Abdul-Wahhaab."
