  "answer": "QUESTION\n1.) What is the reward for praying at masjid instead of preying at home? 2.) Is there any reward for preying at masjid when you are late and what about missed preyers? 3.) I heard yoor preyer is 70 times more valued if you brush your teeth during wudu..is this true and if yes how should this be done in order not to invalidate ur wudu. 4.) is it allowed for a non married young man (under 30) whose hair is going grey to color it in dark-brown (i know black color is forbiden).5.) are we allowed to hang out with muslims who do not practise islam and are we allowed to have such friends over internet\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. The reward of Salaat with Jamaat in the Musjid is 27 times more than Salaat at home. (Bukhari). It is Waajib for one who stays in close proximity to a Musjid, to perform Salaat in the Musjid. (Shaami vol.1 pg.554)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. If you know that Salaat in the Musjid is already over, then you should perform Salaat at home with your family, thus, at least getting reward for performing Salaat in Jamaat.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Salaat performed after using Miswaak during Wudhu is 70 times better. (Maqaasidul Hasanah). One should use the Miswaak before beginning the Wudhu, thus, there will be no fear of invalidating the Wudhu. If you fear your gums bleeding, then use a soft Miswaak and only brush the teeth and the tongue ? not the gums.%0D%0A%0D%0A4. It is permissible to use any colour except black. However, it should be borne in mind that deceiving people into believing that this is your original hair colour is not permissible. Thus, the best option would be to use a Mehndi (which is dark red) or a dye which makes it apparent that this is not your normal hair colour. Another point when using dye is to ensure that it does not contain Haraam ingredients neither does it prevent water from reaching the hair.%0D%0A%0D%0A5. Nabi [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam] has mentioned, ?A person will inevitably follow the religious inclinations of his close friends, so be careful about whom you befriend.? (Tirmidhi). This noble Hadith clearly shows the importance of keeping good company and staying away from evil company. Mixing with those who don?t practise on Deen should only be to invite them towards good and to advise them to stay away from evil. The same would apply to friends over the net.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
