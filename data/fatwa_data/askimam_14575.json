  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamu Aliakum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu,\n\n \n\nJazak Allah khair for answering our questions, and helping us to follow the right method of ibadah.  I have to questions Mufti Saheb, I would appreciate that if you could answer both of them.\n\n \n\nI heard that according to one of the students of Imam Abu Hanifa (RA); Imam Abu Yousuf (RA), reciting the Qur’an (holding the Qur’an in hand) in namaaz is acceptable. I am a bit shocked by this statement, please help in clarifying it.\nI heard from an alim saying that, reciting the Qur’an (holding the Qur’an in hand) in namaaz is not acceptable in any Mazahib.  Is the alim right.\nHow is Traweeh prayer Sunnat-e-Muakkadah, if Prophet (PBUH) prayed it once or twice in his life?\n\n \n\nJazak Allah Khair\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab, it is not permissible to hold the Quran and recite in Taraweeh. This is according to some other reliable Madhabs. Every individual should follow the teachings of his/her Imam and others should be tolerant to that.\n\n \n\nA Sunnat-e-Muakkadah act could be established through the consensus of he Sahabah and their consistent practice as is the case in Taraweeh\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
