  "question": "Does washing impure clothes in a washing machine render them pure?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nA washing machine for clothes washes clothing very thoroughly, and does so twice. I have observed upon actual use of the washing machine that when a child's dirty clothes with urine on them, the impurity does get completely washed off.\n\nDoes this mean that washing such clothes in a washing machine renders them pure in the Shar'i sense as well?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nYes, washing machines do purify clothing of najasah (impurity), as the water is drained out and refilled until the detergent and impurities are washed away.[i]\n\nDry cleaning on the other hand, often utilizes one chemical to clean multiple loads of clothing in which pure and impure mix, and does not purify the najasah (impurity). If clothing is given to a dry cleaning service  you should wash it again to make it pure.[ii]\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMl.
