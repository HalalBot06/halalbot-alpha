  "question": "When we make duaa, are all of our requests granted, whether they be something Islamic (forgiveness of sins etc.), or something material?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) states, 'Whenever a Muslim asks from\nAllah Ta'ala, He grants him his request so long as he does not ask for\nanything Haraam or it is not to break family ties. There are three ways in\nwhich Allah Ta'ala accepts Du'aas. They are as follows:\na) Allah Ta'ala grants him exactly what is asked for.\nb) Allah Ta'ala rewards him in the Hereafter in lieu of his Du'aa.\nc) Allah Ta'ala saves him from a calamity that was to befall him in exchange\nof his supplication.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
