  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have read that the hijab we use should extend to cover our bosom. If we are wearing salwar which has a long piece of extra cloth which perfectly covers the bosom, should we still wear the head scarf in a way that covers the bosom. Wouldnt the long piece of clothe draped over the bosom serve the purpose ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nAs Muslims, we are very fortunate to be the followers of such a deen which is complete and comprehensive. In our daily lives we ought to be vigilant of falling into the traps of shaitaan. A person at every given moment should be aware of obeying every single commandment of Allah Ta’āla more so in today’s times keeping in mind the amount of fitnah that has befallen us.\n\nThe aspect of hijāb is considered to be something of the past. It is such a delicate and renowned issue at this present moment throughout the world.  There are so many people for it and at the same time so many against it. Nevertheless, it is the duty of every Muslimah individual to uphold and revere this outstsanding practice of Islam. Furthemore, the aspect of hijāb all boils down to modesty and shame. The most important thing is to conceal ones body from those who have been prohibited to glance at any woman no matter what type of garb is adorned.\n\nModesty is a noble characteristic which should be adopted into every aspect of life. Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said:\n\nإن مما أدرك الناس من كلام النبوة ، إذا لم تستحى فافعل ما شئت\n\n\"Indeed, surely people will come to know the words of prophethood. If you do not have shame, then do as you wish.”\n\n (Sahīh Al-Bukhari, Vol. 4, Pg. 183, Dār Al-Fikr)\n\nالحياء من الإيمان والإيمان فى الجنة والبذاء من الجفاء والجفاء فى النار\n\n\"Modesty is from Iman, and Iman leads you to Paradise. Shamelessness is from futile things, and futile things lead you to the fire of Hell.”\n\n \n\n (Sunan Al-Tirmidhi, Vol. 2, Pg. 21, HM Saeed)\n\n \n\nAllah Ta’ala says in the Quran “Oh Nabi, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers that they should draw down their jilbābs (outer covering) over them’’ (33:59)\n\nThis command is addressed to the women of the ummat until the day of judgment. Ibn Masūd and Ibn Abbās (Radhi yallāhu anhum) states that this verse refers to covering the entire body including the face.                                                               \n\n(Sahīh mukhatasr ibn kathīr, Vol. 3, Pg. 1458-1459 Dār as Salām)\n\nUmme Salama (Radhi yallāhu anha) was asked regarding the interpretation of this verse, she replied, This verse was revealed regarding the Ansāri women who were seen wearing long black garments”\n\nHijāb essentially requires that women not appear infront of strange males without proper covering (hijāb). This has been an established practice amongst all the Ambiyā (Alayhimus salātu wa salām) , Sahāba (Radhi yallāhu anhum) and all righteous people.\n\nThe essence of hijāb is that the body is concealed with such a covering that does not expose the figure or shape of the body and it should not be done with such clothing that clings to the body. If the shalwār khamees fulfills these criterias, then it will be perfectly normal to wear it considering ones self to be in a state of hijāb.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl.
