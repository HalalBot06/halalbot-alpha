  "question": "Is it permissible to watch cartoons on the computer? As it is the ruling of most Ulema that pictures on the computer screen are not prohibited.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe factor which prohibits cartoons, movies and games on computer is not pictures in this case. Instead it falls under the category of Lahw and La?ib (useless forms of amusement).\n\nThere is no doubt that these cartoons and games is an absolute waste of time and energy and there is no benefit. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?It is from the excellence of a man?s Islam that he leaves what does not concern him.? (Tirmidhi). In another Hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) says, ?The involvement of a person in useless and futile issues and talks is a sign of Allah?s anger on him.? (Rabbaani)\n\nMay Allah Ta?ala save us from all Fitnahs, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
