However, it is permissible for a Mujaahid (warrior) to apply black\ndye in order to give the impression of being young. (Jawahirul Fiqh vol2\npg421)\nTo dye the hair any other colour besides black e.g. Mehndi or Katm (type of\ngrass) is permissible. This was the practice of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu\nÁlayhi Wasallam) and the Sahaaba (Radhiyallaahu Ánhum). (Jawahirul Fiqh vol2\npg421)\n2. It is permissible to listen to the Qur'aan audio tape.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
