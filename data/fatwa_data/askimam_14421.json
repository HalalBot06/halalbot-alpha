  "question": "My question is can we as Hanafi's perform Witr behind a Shafee Imam and vice versa",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDuring Ramadaan, the huffaaz take turns to perform Esha and Witr Salaat - At the time of Witr, the Shafee Imam and a few of the Shafee musallees go to the back to perform the witr. We find this against the spirit of brotherhood, as all of us prayed the Esha and Taraweeh together, so why can we not pray the witr together.\n\nMy question is can we as Hanafi's perform Witr behind a Shafee Imam and vice versa\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is permissible for a Hanafi to follow a Shaafi’ee Imaam in Witr provided the Shaafi’ee Imaam does not make salaam at the end of 2 Rakaats and at the time of commencing Witr he makes a general intention of performing Witr, i.e. does not specify Sunnah / Nafl, etc. (Imdaadul Ahkaam vol.1 pg.597)\n\nHe should also abide by the laws of Tahaara according to the Hanafi Madhab. (Tabyeenul Haqaaiq vol.1 pg.427; Beirut)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
