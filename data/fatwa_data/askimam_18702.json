  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am government service holder working in department of fisheries as Biochemist. In my office we take Shrimp, Prawn (Chingri) for laboratory test from different companies. After testing the Sample, we give those companies certificate for export those Shrimp, Prawn. Companies give us 3/4/5 kg Prawn/Shrimp for per test, but per test we need only 100/200gm. So the residue shrimp and prawn are distributed among Officers. But the government rule is to dump the residue of the sample. On the other hand we never offer the companies to take back the residue shrimp and prawn. Now my question is the residue shrimp, prawn we have taken is Halal or Haram?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh  \n\n \n\nGenerally the prawns, shrimps etc that are given as samples are merely given for test purposes and not for their consumption.\n\nIf this is the case, it will not be permissible to take or to consume these prawns, shrimps etc. It was not given to the government as a gift, hence, ownership of these prawns, shrimps etc was not taken. Furthermore, by taking / consuming these prawns, you will also be going directly against the law of the government (i.e. to dump the residue).\n\nYou may request your superiors to seek a leeway from the government not to dump the surplus prawns and to acquire permission from the company to consume the surplus.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā"
