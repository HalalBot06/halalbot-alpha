  "question": "Saying Aameen when the Imam completes Surah Faatiha",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. Is saying \"aameen\" when the imaam completes Surah Al-Fatiha proof for \"making dua collectively\"? Is it \"Sunnah\" in this case but \"permissible\" otherwise?\n\n\n2. Is there a difference of opinion among the noble Ulema about the permissibility of ijtima (mass congregation) of tableeghi jamaat on some publicly announced days every year? Is the ruling same for local ijtima (congregation of the city only)?\n\n\n3. If I have haraam money (earned through haraam means or by wronging someone that cannot be given back to its rightful owner), I understand that I am required to give it away in charity without the intention of reward. My question is that must the person receiving this \"charity\" be eligible for receiving Zakaat (i.e., must he be a mustehaq-e-zakaat)?\n\nMay Allah give you the best of rewards for your efforts.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n1.         Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said, “When the Imam says Aameen, then you (the followers) say Aameen. That person whose Aameen coincides with the Aameen of the Imam, his previous sin will be forgiven.\n\nIt is understood from the above hadith that to say Aameen is encouraged and rewarding. To make collective duaa after fardh salaah is mubaah (permissible). The general principal of a mubaah act is one may do it without regarding it as compulsory. One should not impose this act on others or one should not condemn others for not practicing on the mubaah act.\n\n2.         The practice of Ijtima is mubaah. Nobody regards the Ijtima to be fardh or wajib or sunnah. The Ijtima is scheduled according to convenience, for example during public holidays etc. to facilitate for as many people as possible to attend.\n\n3.         The recipient must be eligible to accept zakat. \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
