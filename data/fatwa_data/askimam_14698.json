  "question": "\"Ya Allah, give my son the 'Akhlaq' of Hazrat Muhammed (peace be upon him). The Sabr of Ibraheem (alayhu salaam), the beauty of Yousuf (alayhu Salaam)\" etc.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalam-o-Alaikum,\n\nIs it okay to pray for your child like, since we cannot become like prophets.\n\n\"Ya Allah, give my son the 'Akhlaq' of Hazrat Muhammed (peace be upon him). The Sabr of Ibraheem (alayhu salaam), the beauty of Yousuf (alayhu Salaam)\" etc.\nAnd is it okay to ask a prayer like the following when our primary role model is Hazrat Muhammed (SAW).\n\nYa Allah, give my son the habit of truth like that of Hazrat Abu Bakr (ra).\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram\n\n \n\n \n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\n \n\n \n\nThere are two issues, Ikhtiyaari- that is an issue within ones reach and ability. For example Akhlaaq (character) and Sabr (patience). These are within our reach and possible to achieve. It is permissible to make such a Dua.\n\n \n\n \n\nThe other issue is Ghair Ikhtiyaari. That is not within our reach. For example, beauty. We do not have any choice in our creation, colour and beauty. That is the sole right of Allah. There is no point in making Dua of the beauty of Yusuf Alayhi Salaam for ones child.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
