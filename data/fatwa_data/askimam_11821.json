  "question": "I have a question regarding a Hadith reported in Muslim. The Hadith says: Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (saw) having said: â€œBy Him in Whose Hand",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nis my life, if you were not to commit sin, Allah would sweep you out of existence and He would replace (you by) those people who would commit sin and seek forgiveness from Allah, and He would have pardoned them.? I fail to understand the Hadith as it seems to encourage people to sin and then repent when at present our ummah has become the worse and doesn?t require further encouragement for sin. I request you as a learnt scholar to do something abt such Hadith which confuse the Muslim Ummah. Wht does sweep out of existence of those who r free from sin mean? And doesn?t the Hadith contradict with other Hadith of sever admonition 4 committing sins? Please Explain.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe religion of Islam is complete and comprehensive. It also takes into consideration the different nature of mankind.%0D%0A%0D%0AAt times, a human being is hopeful and at times he is despondent. If both these attitudes are controlled and moderated, then the consequences will be positive. If any one of these attitudes go to the extreme, then that is very dangerous. A person who is hopeful to the extreme, may not fear Allah and violate the laws of Allah. Similarly, if a person is completely despondent, he will also not turn to Allah. %0D%0A%0D%0AA Muslim is advised to be like a bird with two wings ? hope and fear. In favourable conditions, he also fears Allah so that he does not become unmindful of the punishment of Allah. In adverse conditions, he should also be hopeful of the mercy of Allah. To be despondent of the mercy of Allah is Kufr as Allah states, ?Do not be despondent of the mercy of Allah?. The Ahadith of hope and forgiveness is not to encourage sin but to motivate one to repent to Allah and get closer to Him. Those that commit sin should be reminded of the verses of punishment of Allah and the fire of hell.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
