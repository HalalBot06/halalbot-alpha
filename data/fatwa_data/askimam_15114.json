  "question": "Is having a beard or wearing a topi dawwah, even if I do not verbally speak?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs having a beard or wearing a topi dawwah, even if I do not verbally speak?\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe beard and topi are blessed Sunnah of our Nabi (Salalahu Alayhi Wasallam). Every Sunnah of our Nabi (Salalahu Alayhi Wasallam) is full of attraction and Barakah. Certainly wearing a beard and topi itself is a Dawah, however, together with that you must verbally encourage others to follow the Sunnah. Allah states “Remind each other for a reminder is beneficial for the believers”.\n\nAnd Allah knows best \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
