  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy mum uses a herbal medicine which has some oyster shell. Is it permissible to use this?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n It is impermissible to consume any type of animal that lives in the water except the fish. Oysters are not classified as fish according to the Jurists; therefore, if medications containing oyster are for consumption, it will not be permissible. [Ref: Raddul-Mukhtaar vol. 6 pg. 306. H.M. Saeed].\n\n However, if there is no alternative medication and an experienced Muslim doctor or the Muslim herbalist advises that your mother is in need of this medication; such medication will then be permissible to use.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalamu Alaykum\n\n\n\nMl. Mohammad Ashhad bin Said\n\nCorrespondence Iftaa Student, Mauritius\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
