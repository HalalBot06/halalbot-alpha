  "question": "1. 2.Advise me how, in present traumatic condition, we couple can lead a peaceful Islamic lif here & a gifted life hereafter along with our late son .",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am an ordinary Muslim working in a good organization/post by the sheer grace of Allah . I do follow ?Islamic tenets? as much as possible. I used to teach my late son (only child) for same also. Nowadays I am under severe distress due to mysterious death (killed & then hanged or suicide ) of my son (only child) of 23 years, was studying in Engineering (2nd yr.). All my well wisher Alims console me with the followings, Quote 1. U have nothing to do with his death as hayat(span of life) was destined by ?Allah? 2. U need not go/think in the cause of death. He will get level of sahid 3. U will get niamul-badl(better return) Unquote In Quran I have read (Theme - Life and death is from Allah) -3.156 ?It is Allah that gives life and death? 3.154 Say:\"Even if you had remained in your homes those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death\" 2.155 (Theme-Allah will test the Believer's belief) ? ?We shall surely test your steadfastness with fear and famine, with loss of property, life and produce. Give good news to those who endure with patience? ButI am very much pained as very often my mind boggles on the cause of death fearing if it was suicide, as it is prohibited in Islam and emanates very wrong signal to the society (Hindu & Muslim). I also fell pained/guilty of not done proper tarbiyyat(upbringing) of my son.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazaakumullah for writing to the institute.\n\nWe are slaves of Allah and we have full belief that Allah does as He wills. You did the best to bring your child up according to the Shari?ah. You are not responsible for anything more than that. You are advised to continuously make Istighfaar and also to do good deeds such as giving charity and intend the reward for your son.\n\nIt is hoped that through this Allah will relieve him of any punishment he was to suffer.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
