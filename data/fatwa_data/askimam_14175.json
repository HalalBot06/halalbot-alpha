  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. What are the different ways wudhu is broken? I will really appreciate if you can please explain in detail.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThings that break Wudhu:\n\n1. When anything comes out from the former and hind private parts. However, according to correct opinion, air that comes out of the penis or vagina does not break Wudhu.\n\n2. After childbirth even though blood does not come out;\n\n3. Any flowing impurity, e.g. blood, pus, even if it does not come out of the two exits;\n\n4. Vomit of food, water, clot of blood or yellow water which is a mouthful;\n\n5. To vomit at short intervals but the total quantity of vomited matter equals a mouthful;\n\n6. When blood is more than or equal to the spittle (this refers to the blood of the month);\n\n7. While sleeping with the buttocks off the ground, e.g. on the side;\n\n8. If while sitting in sleep, the buttocks happen to lift off the ground, then the Wudhu will break irrespective of whether a person fell or not;\n\n9. Unconsciousness, fainting;\n\n10. Madness, becoming insane;\n\n11. Consuming any form of intoxication;\n\n12. To laugh aloud in such a Salaat that has Ruku and Sajdah (not Janaaza Salaat)\n\n13. Contact of genitals of two persons in a lustful state;\n\n14. Emission of semen due to shock, fall, etc.\n\n15. Emission of dirty fluid from sore eyes;\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
