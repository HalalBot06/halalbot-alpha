  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have read a rebuttal of their position that Imam Ashari, after having left the Mutazilites, created a new creed that was a mix of Mutazili and Sunni doctrine. The Salafis say he refuted this new creed by writing the Ibana, but this rebuttal says the Ibana was one of his earlier books, not his last. I was wondering if you could read this rebuttal by Sheikh Nuh Keller and confirm or add to it. It is at the following site: http://66.34.131.5/ISLAM/nuh/masudq2.htm\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe concur with the article.\n\nUnfortunately, time does not allow us to go into further detail and add to\nthe article.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
