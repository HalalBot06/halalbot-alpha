  "question": "What should I do if I unintentionally break the fast?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI did not know that there is a difference between mazi and mani. I thought that they are the same. Because of this, when some mazi was excreted, during my fast, I thought that the fast has been invalidated. As a consequence I masturbated, thinking that since the fast has already been invalidated. What should I do? I have however, stopped the evil act of masturbation. As for the Sawn, Would it be correct to make Tawba and make a Qada Sawm? Or do I have to go fulfil the requirements of fasting for 60 consecutive days and so on.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFirstly, it should be clarified that even if mani(sperm) was emitted without masturbation or intercourse, then this doesn't break the fast. (Imdaadul Fattah Pg.674)\n\nAs for breaking the fast by masturbating, this is a sin and you should make taubah, however all you will have to do is make qadha of that day. Kaffara is not necessary.(Imdaadul Fattah Pg.691)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
