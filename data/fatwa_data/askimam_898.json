  "question": "Can you tell me about heaven?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is our belief as Muslims that Almighty Allah Ta'ala sent us to this world%0D%0Ato test our obedience to Him. We also believe in resurrection from the grave%0D%0Aand accountability in the court of Allah Ta'ala. If we are successful in the%0D%0Acourt of Allah, we will be favoured with the Mercy of Allah through His%0D%0Abounties in Jannah (paradise, heaven). If we are unsuccessful, then if Allah%0D%0Awishes He may forgive us and grant us Jannah or punish us through Jahannum%0D%0A(hell).%0D%0A%0D%0AThe realities of Jannah are beyond our understanding, therefore, Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'The bounties of Jannah have not been%0D%0Aseen by any eye, heard by any ear or have not passed the imagination of any%0D%0Aheart. (Mishkaat).%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) described some bounties of%0D%0AJannah according to our level of understanding. The ground in Jannah will be%0D%0Aof strong musk, thereby giving out the most beautiful scent. (Ibid). The%0D%0Apebbles of Jannah will be of precious pearls and rubies. (Ibid). The bricks%0D%0Aof the palaces in Jannah will be of gold and silver. The cement attaching%0D%0Athe bricks will also be of musk. (Ibid)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe carpets in the palaces will be as think as the distance between the%0D%0Askies and the earth. (Ibid) There will be four streams of milk, honey, wine%0D%0Aand crystal clear water. The Jannah of the lowest person will be ten times%0D%0Athis world. (Bukhari).%0D%0A%0D%0ANo person in Jannah will be regarded low, irrespective of his position.%0D%0A(Mishkaat). After having witnessed and enjoyed all the bounties of Jannah,%0D%0AAllah will grant the opportunity to witness His magnificent countenance.%0D%0AEvery dweller of Jannah will be dumb stricken by that view and will%0D%0Acontinuously stare at Allah. (Ibid). According to Imaam Ghazzaaly, a person%0D%0Awill continuously stare at Allah for at least 80 million years. Thereafter,%0D%0Athat opportunity will be afforded to individuals according to their%0D%0Acloseness and sacrifices they made in this world. Lastly, but not least,%0D%0AAllah will announce to His successful servants that He has favoured them%0D%0Awith His eternal pleasure and that He will never be displeased with them.%0D%0A(Ibid). There would not be any great pleasure in Jannah that being conferred%0D%0Awith the pleasure of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe make Du'aa to Allah to forgive us, our parents, our Asaatidha, our wives%0D%0Aand all our children and the entire Ummah of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) and to favour us with His Jannah, Aameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
