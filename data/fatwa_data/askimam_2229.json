  "question": "My cousins have a wine shop in USA and their most of the earnings are from that shop.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSo being a cousin is it permissible for us to live and eat with them as we have very close relations. As it is not good to break relations with our relatives as told by PROPHET MOHAMMED(SAW).Please help me in this situation. WASALAM\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, if your relatives' major source of income is from Haraam\n(sales of wine, etc.) then you cannot accept their invitation unless you are\ncertain that only Halaal income has been used to prepare the food.\n\nDue to the close family relationship, we advise you apply wisdom and\ndiplomacy in communicating with them your objection and advise them to\nrefrain from sales of wine. If they express difficulty in doing so, they\nshould be referred to a Mufti to assist them in addressing their\npredicament.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
