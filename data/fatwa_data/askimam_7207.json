  "question": "Is Sufism essential to Muslim life or is the practice of Islam merely a matter of observing the law?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTrue and authentic Tasawwuf is in fact the law. Some laws deal with the external actions such as Salaat, Hajj, etc. these are discussed by the Fuqahaa.\n\nSome laws apply to the inner self, e.g. to free oneself from pride, jealousy, etc. This dimension is discussed with the Soofiya. However, it is the injunction of the Qur?aan and Ahaadith to free oneself from pride, etc. Thus Tasawwuf deals with the laws associated with the innerself. It is, therefore, essential to adopt Tasawwuf so that one may act on those laws which deal with the inner self.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
