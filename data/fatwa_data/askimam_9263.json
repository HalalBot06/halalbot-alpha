  "question": "Tell me some Dua so that i get barkatin the money iam earning, iam earning the money in a halal way but there is no barkat in it.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two issues to your request. First and foremost, it is important to assess why there is no Barakah. If we prescribe some Du?aa for Barakah but the causes of no Barakah are not identified, then no amount of Du?aa will bring Barakah.%0D%0A%0D%0ASome of the things that take away Barakah in one?s earnings is:%0D%0A%0D%0A1. Committing sins.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. Not performing the five daily Salaats. In the case of males, not performing Salaat in the Musjid.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. Not spending within one?s means and confining one?s expenses to the needs.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf one adheres to the above three advices, then there is no reason for one not having Barakah in one?s earnings. One great scholar advised, ?When you have a need, then only go to the Bazaar. Don?t go to the Bazaar and look for your needs.? There is a big difference between the two approaches. In the first approach, you exercise restraint and save your income. In the second one, you are bound to spend more than the need. How is it then expected to have Barakah? %0D%0A%0D%0AApart from adhering to the above three advices, also recite ?Allaahumma ikfiniy bi halaalika an haraamika, wa aghniniy bi fadhlika amman siwaaka?.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
