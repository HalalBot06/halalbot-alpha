  "question": "1. My wife is wearing purdah, as the consequence I think I have to do all the shopping and other family needs outside the house. But sometimes, I feel, she became very much independent.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nShe doesn?t know where to pay the bills etc. I allow here to go out from the house by herself, if she wants to, but she herself is reluctant to go out. Is this OK? 2. If we are going hajj to become a badal for our father who has passed away, does the expenses has to be shared among all his children?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Your wife should be commended for her intentions, indeed the safest place for women is her home. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has cursed women who emerge from their homes unnecessarily. We advise encourage your wife with kind words to remain indoors in this era is rare.\n\n2. If your deceased father has made a bequest to perform Hajj-e-Badal, the money may be drawn from the inheritance with the consent of all the heirs. However, if you perform the Hajj voluntarily, the other heirs are not bound to pay towards the expenses. If they do so, it will be out of their kind offering.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
