  "question": "She said to her husband 'you are not my husband'",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan you please help me  whether the marriage contract  is effected, if a wife tell's  her husband in anger  that ''you are not  my husband anymore''.If the marriage is effected then what should she do about it as she regrets all what she said.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAcording to Shariah, the right of divorce is vested in the husband. A wife cannot independently issue divorce. Therefore, the wife’s statement does not constitute divorce. However, it is irresponsible of the wife to make such a statement. She should make tawba and exercise restraint in the future.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
