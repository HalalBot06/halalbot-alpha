  "question": "Isn't marriage better than ignoring? I want to refer to questions 4164 and 4220!",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI want to refer to questions 4164 and 4220! Don't you think that it is best to get married to a person you have committed adultery rather than ignore what you have done and let the girl suffer after being married to another person who finds that out and then makes the life of the girl miserable? The consequences are bad, if parents do not allow such marriages, based on their differences.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMarriage is a major step in a person's life. He is tying himself to a person\nfor the rest of his/her life.\n\nHence, there are a number of factors taken into account before marriage. You\nhave indicated just one factor. If it is in the best interests of both\nparties to get married to the girl he made Zina with, then we would also\nagree with your view.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda"
