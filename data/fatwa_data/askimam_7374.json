  "question": "I am suffering from extreme amounts of waswaas. I know He Exists, and i know He is One, and i believe in Him. Yet, still, i keep getting waswaas, and that too in Ramadhan.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI believe in Allah and His Messengers, and i seek refuge in Allah. I am suffering from alot of waswaas. I keep getting doubts about Allah's Existence. I know He Exists, and i know He is One, and i believe in Him. Yet, still, i keep getting waswaas, and that too in Ramadhan. This is making me feel miserable and terrible. I feel so depressed because of this. I want someone to teach me rational arguments to prove Allah's Existence, but at present, i can't find anyone. Anyway, could you plz help me out. Could you recommend some du'as from the Qur'an and Sunnah? Could you tell me what could help me recover, from this illness, which is ruining my life?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is absolutely nothing to doubt Allah's existence. You dont need any one to explain you this just look at your own body. %0D%0A%0D%0AIt is accepted that to manufacture any thing two things are essential, a)Space b) Light %0D%0A%0D%0ALook at the human body how Allah creates it in the womb of the mother without any space, light? Infact Allah says in the holy quraan that he created you in three layers of darkness.Who fed us in the womb of our mothers?Who manufactered the bones?Who placed those beautiful eyes in the front of our head not at the back?Who gave us ears to hear ? %0D%0A%0D%0AApproxcimately 300 000 babies are born daily.Did you ever hear a shortage of eyes or any one born without any ears? %0D%0A%0D%0ALike this there are a multitudes of examples.Recite the quraan daily and ponder over the meaning this shall answer all our questions. %0D%0A%0D%0ALastly,these are just shaytaani taughts which come in diffrent ways,just ignore them and carry on completing our obligations to Almighty Allah. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
