  "question": "You have stated on your website that shares are permissible. But don't shares involve gambling and chance?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have asked this question because you have said insurance is haram. A person may lose money or he may get back some money. It is basically the same thing with shares.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nBy shares, one is investing as a partner in a business venture. This is not the case in gambling and insurance.\n\nIn gambling you are merely paying for a right to receive a certain fixed amount, depending on the occurrence of an uncertain event. The two are completely different and shares cannot be compared with gambling.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
