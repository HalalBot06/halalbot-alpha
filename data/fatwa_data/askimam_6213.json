  "question": "Can you please code a hadith which explains the masah (of the head, ears, and especially back of the neck). 2; how we can distinguish between thick and spares beard",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Hadhrat Mugheera ibn Shu'ba (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) once passed by some people, relieved himself and thereafter performed Wudhu, making Masah upon his forehead.' %0D%0AIbn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrates that Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) when performing Wudhu gargled his mouth, rinsed his nostrils and%0D%0Aafter washing his face and hands uptil his elbows, he made Masah upon his%0D%0Ahead and ears using both index fingers for the inner portion and the thumbs%0D%0Afor the outside part.' There are lots of Ahaadith indicating to Masah of the%0D%0Aneck, however, all of them are weak. From this, the Fuqahaa state that it is%0D%0AMustahabb to make Masah of the neck.%0D%0A2. If the skin is visible and the water can reach the skin, then this is%0D%0Asparse and it will be compulsory for one to make sure that the water reaches%0D%0Athe skin. If it is not visible, but instead, the hair covers up the skin%0D%0Aproperly, then this will be thick, hence, it will not be compulsory.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
