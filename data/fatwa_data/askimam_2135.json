  "question": "Is using lotion that contains alcohol permissable?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible to use lotions and cosmetics that contain alcohol from\ngrapes or date extracts. However, if the alcohol is synthetic, it is pure\nand permissible.\n\nSometimes, it becomes difficult to differentiate between genuine and\nsynthetic alcohol. Thus, to be the safe side, one should rather prefer using\nnon-alcohol lotions especially when such lotions are easily available.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
