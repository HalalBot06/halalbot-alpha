  "question": "I was planning to buy capsules which in them they have a mixture of Royal Jelly, Propolis and Bee Pollen all of which are halal.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalam Alaykum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu.\n\n1- I was planning to buy capsules which in them they have a mixture of Royal Jelly, Propolis and Bee Pollen all of which are halal. But I had to ask the supplier of this immune boosting combination this question:- \"Is the capsule made of animal or plant gelatin??\" This was their answer :- \"Our capsules are bovine only from USA supplies.  They are kosher\".\n\nSo here we see that the contents inside the capsules are halaal products but the encapsulating material is made from gelatin which is kosher (I read from dictionary that kosher is what has been done according to jewish traditions) This is the link of the product http://www.durhamsbeefarm.com/queensdelight.htm\n\nSo am I allowed to eat this product?\n\n2- There is another bee product whose capsule is made from cow gelatin but the manufacturers are in South Korea and they sent me a certificate proving that it is halaal gelatin with a stamp and signature from Saudi Arabia Consulate in their country who wrote there in arabic that it's permissible with stamp and signature. The manufacturers are SAMMI INDUSTRIAL CO., LTD (in South Korea)\n\nJazakumullahu Khayran brothers\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMuhtaram\n\n \n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\n \n\nThe terms Halaal (edible according to Islamic Law) or Kosher (edibile according to Jewish Law) are broadly used and may not necessarily reflect their intended reality. For example, Halaal means an animal slaughtered according to the Islamic Laws of slaughtering, that is, a Muslim slaughters the animal, he recites the name of Allah upon slaughtering the animal, and he severs at least two or more veins. In spite of this certain parts of the slaughtered animal remains haraam (opposite of Halaal). It is not for anyone to pronounce an item being Halaal or haraam. The same may be true regarding Kosher. Many people are aware of the terms Halaal and Kosher but do not understand the terms and conditions before an item is pronounced Halaal. The literal understanding of the item being permissible for consumption is taken.\n\n \n\nThe suppliers statement that their capsules are from bovine and and are Kosher could be correct only if it is proven that only jews in the slaughter cattle. This seems to be far fetched and the term Kosher could be understood in the literal sense. In such an instance, the capsule will not be permissible.\n\n \n\nYou should also enquire from the manufacturers directly the procedure of the slaughtering of the cattle from which the gelatine is manufactured. If the cattle are slaughtered according to Shariah Laws of Zabah (Slaughter), then only the capsule will be Halaal. It should also be pointed out that if the medication in the capsule is necessary for the patient and there is no adequate (Halaal) alternate for that medicine, then one would be excused for taking such capsules.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
