  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaams.\nWhen growing up I was a competitive swimmer, waterpolo-player, surfer and lifeguard. When the fast came around I would not discontinue these activities even though alot of my friends regarded swimming as being garaam while fasting. I always thought i am not going to swim with the intention of drinking the water and thus swimming was not garaam. Many of them often asked what about the water entering yourt nose and ears? i would like to know ss it permissible to swim, surf , play waterpolo while fasting?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nSwimming does not invalidate the fast on condition you don swallow the water. Water entering the nose and ears do not invalidate the fast.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease Note: Listen to live discourses and advices given by Mufti Ebrahim Desai throughout this Ramadhan streaming on WWW.RADIORAMADHANCROYDON.COM Every alternate day after Fajr. 5:30am and after Taraweeh at 10:15pm.
