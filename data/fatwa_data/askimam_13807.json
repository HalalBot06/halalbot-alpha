  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nwhat is the fatwa of when a husband penetrates his wife from on top of the knickers in such a way that he does not move the knickers to the side and the husand does not ejuculate this is done in ramadan whilst the husband and wife are fasting and what is the fatwa if he does ejuculate inform me what the fatwa is for the hasband and the wife\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIf the husband penetrated his wife without removing the knickers, during the fast of Ramadhaan, that has invalidated the fast.\n\nThe husband and wife will have to offer Kaffaarah of 60 consecutive fasts and one Qadhaa. The ruling will be the same whether the husband ejaculated or not.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
