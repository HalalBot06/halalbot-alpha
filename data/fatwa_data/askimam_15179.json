  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy husband left me when i was 8 month pregnant, due to his parents.he through me out my home. after the birth of my child he sent me talaq 3 weeks later in writing, it was written 3 times. then he came to visit my child and told me had alot of pressure to give me talaq and it was not what he wanted. then he came another time to vist one month from then. this time he stayed with me and we had intercourse. can u tell me is this talaq valid?. is there anyway he can take this talaq back?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf your husband issued you three divorces, that constitutes a valid talaq and it is a talaq-e-mughallazah (a permanently irrevocable divorce). Your iddat had terminated upon finishing three mentural cycles after birth. You cannot be together with your ex-husband. The only way you can reconcile with him is after halala, that is, you marry another person and consummate the marriage. If that husband divorces you, then after the iddat of divorce, you could remarry your ex-husband.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
