  "question": "Is playing chess/checkers haram? If yes, why?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have heard that it is haram because of lut (addiction). If that is so, then wouldn't other addictive things be haram also (i.e. internet, video games, stocks, etc.). And what if one doesn't find it addictive? Is it still haram then?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA: Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Whosoever plays chess, it is as though he soiled his hands in the blood of swine.' (Nasbur-Raayah Vol.4 Pg.274).\n\nThe prohibition is general. However, chess and games of its like are generally addictive and in addition to it are a complete waste of valuable time.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
