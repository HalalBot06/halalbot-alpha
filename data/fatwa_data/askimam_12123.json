  "question": "why is carnauba wax haraam?what is it? and are woman allowed to wear trainers?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Encyclopaedia Britannica has the following on Carnauba wax%0D%0A%0D%0A?Carnauba wax, also called Brazil wax or ceara wax a vegetable wax obtained from the fronds of the carnauba tree (Copernicia cerifera) of Brazil. Valued among the natural waxes for its hardness and high melting temperature, carnauba wax is employed as a food-grade polish and as a hardening or gelling agent in a number of products.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe carnauba tree is a fan palm of the northeastern Brazilian savannas, where it is called the ?tree of life? for its many useful products. After 50 years, the tree can attain a height of over 14 metres (45 feet). It has a dense, large crown of round, light greenleaves.%0D%0A%0D%0AAlthough it has been planted in Sri Lanka and Africa, as well as other parts of South America, only in northern Brazil does the tree produce wax. During the regular dry seasons in Brazil, the carnauba palm protects its metre-long (three-foot) fronds fromloss of moisture by secreting a coat of carnauba wax on the upper and lower leaf surfaces. The leaves are cut from September to March and left in the sun to dry. The powdery waxis removed (by beating the shriveled leaves), then melted, strained, and cooled. The final product is yellow or brownish green, depending on the age of the leaves and the quality of processing.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe wax consists primarily of esters of long-chain alcohols and acids. It has a melting point of about 85%B0 C (185%B0 F). Although it has been replaced in many applications by cheaper synthetics, it is still used as a polish for candies and medicinal pills, as a thickener for solvents and oils, and even as a hardener for printing inks.?%0D%0A%0D%0AThe question of why it is haraam should be posed to those who said it is haraam.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf women are doing some exercise in privacy, then they may wear trainers. It is not the habit of dignified, chaste and bashful women to wear such shoes in public, or when there is no need. It should therefore be avoided in such circumstances. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMl. Imraan Vawda%0D%0AFATWA DEPT."
