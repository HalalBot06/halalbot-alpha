  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCan you please let me know what is the proper way to take out nazr from a baby?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWhilst in the state of Wudhu, one should recite 3 times Durood (Salaat al-Nabiy), 5 times Surah al-Falaq, 5 times Surah al-Naas and 3 times Durood Shareef. Blow in water and use the water to bath the baby for 3 days.\n\nAlso, take 7 dry red chillies, recite Aayaatul Kursi, Surah al-Falaq, Surah al-Naas and Surah al-Faatiha. Blow on the chillies. Take each chille individually and pass it over the child from head to toe and burn them after doing so. Insha Allah, Allah will remove the Nazr from the baby.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
