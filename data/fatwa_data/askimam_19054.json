  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a small beard but, for the past few months, I have a feeling that I should shave it for a while and then regrow it later when I feel so.  I pray five times a day and have no issues in faith or following the obligations of Islām.  However, when I kept the beard, I was frustrated and surrounded by many problems five years ago.  I feel that if I shave it for a while and then keep the beard again, it would be with a new and pure spirit.  Please guide.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n \n\nAlhamdulillāh, Allāh Ta`ālā has given you the tawfīq to grow a beard and follow the injunctions of the Sharī`ah.  It would be highly reprehensible and utterly ungrateful of you to now break the laws of the Sharī`ah and depart from the sunnah of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم by shaving off the beard. \n\n \n\nYou have connected the frustrations and problems you faced a few years ago to your beard.  Not only is it unclear how you have made this association, but it does not hold true rationally either.  Allāh Ta`ālā has made acting upon the sunnah of His beloved Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم a source of thawāb (rewards) and barakah (blessings), not frustration and problems.  As a part of our trials and test of this world, we all face difficulties.  Thankfully, Allāh Ta`ālā has taught us how to deal with such situations, as well.\n\n \n\nوَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُمْ بِشَيْءٍ مِنَ الْخَوْفِ وَالْجُوعِ وَنَقْصٍ مِنَ الْأَمْوَالِ وَالْأَنْفُسِ وَالثَّمَرَاتِ وَبَشِّرِ الصَّابِرِينَ (155) الَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُمْ مُصِيبَةٌ قَالُوا إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ (156) أُولَئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ صَلَوَاتٌ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ وَأُولَئِكَ هُمُ الْمُهْتَدُونَ (البقرة: 155-157)\n\nAnd, certainly, We shall test you with some fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives, and fruits, but give glad tidings to those who are patient.  [They are those] who, when afflicted with calamity, say, “Truly, to Allāh we belong and, truly, to Him shall we return.”  They are those on whom are the blessings from their Lord and [His] mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones (Qur’ān 2:155-157)\n\n \n\nTherefore, when you are faced with difficulties, which we all inevitably face, you should be patient and cling on the sunnah of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم even more in order to receive the blessings from Allāh Ta`ālā.  Shaytān will try to exploit the situation and try to convince you to depart from the sunnah with the kind of reasoning mentioned in the question, i.e. shave off the beard in order to regrow it later with a new and pure spirit.  Recognizing that these are the attempts of our sworn enemy to deprive us of our rewards and blessings, you should pay no heed such thoughts and remain steadfast on the sunnah of our beloved Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم.  InshāAllāh, you will get through your difficulties and find ease in your matters.\n\n \n\nفَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا (5) إِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا (الشرح: 5-6)\n\nVerily, along with every hardship is relief.  Surely, along with hardship is relief (Qur’ān 94:5-6)\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\n \n\nMuftī Abrar Mirza\n\nChicago, IL (USA)\n\n \n\n \n\nUnder the Supervision of:\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nSouth Africa\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n________________________________________________________________________\nVisit us at:\nhttp://www.askimam.org\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/shariahcompliant  [Shari῾ah Compliant Business Campaign] |http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shifaa [As-Shifā` Islamic Forum] | http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ulama_sa [Ulamā-SA Islamic Forum]\n\n \n\nDISCLAIMER – AskImam.org questions\n\nAskImam.org answers issues pertaining to Sharī’ah.
