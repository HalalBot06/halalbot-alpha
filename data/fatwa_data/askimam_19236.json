  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nCould you please give me some dua's for anxiety and depression.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\nWhat is the cause of the anxiety and depression?\n\nIt is important to treat the cause. Duas alone are not sufficient to overcome anxiety and depression. We are living in a world of cause and effect and in the world of means. To diagnose a problem and adopt means for cure is the teaching of Shariah. Rasulullah salallahu alayhi wasallam and the Sahaba radi allahu anhum faced various challenges in their lives.\n\nThey attempted to identify the cause of the problems and adopted means to remedy the problems. Yes, they took strength and courage through Salah and Duas.\n\nAt times our own actions lead us to anxiety and depression. The remedy is then simple. Self reformation. In such a situation ones can make any amount of dua and Dhikr, his wrong deeds will still drown him in grief and depression.\n\nThis life is filled with challenges and adversities. It is natural to feel anxious and experience grief. The best solution for such feelings is to remind ourselves that we are muslims and we are sent in this world to be tested.\n\n \n\nA feeling of anxiety is actually a test from Allah. Allah want to see our reaction. We are caught between the order of Allah and our Nafs.\n\nTo control ones Nafs at this time and remind ourself of Allahs test is what Allah wants from us. It is then Allah’s help will come.\n\nIt is the barakaat of such submission, duas and Dhikr that Allah will guide one to the road of relief and comfort.\n\nAllah Ta’ala tells us\n\nيَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اسْتَعِينُوا بِالصَّبْرِ وَالصَّلَاةِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ مَعَ الصَّابِرِينَ\n\nO you who believe! Seek assistance through patience and Salah.\nIndeed Allah with those who are the patient ones.\n\n(Qur’an 2:153)\n\nRasulullah salallahu alayhi wasallam advised us the following dua for grief and depression.\n\n \n\nاَلَّلهُمَّ إِنِّيْ أَعُوْذُ بِكَ مِنَ الْهَمِّ وَالْحُزْنِ\nوَأَعُوْذُ بِكَ    مِنَ الْعَجْزِ وَ الْكَسَلِ\nوَأَعُوْذُ بِكَ مِنَ الْبُخْلِ وَالْجُبْنِ  \nوَأَعُوْذُ بِكَ مِن غَلَبَةِ الدَّيْنِ وَقَهْرِ الرِّجَالِ\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\n \n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai"
