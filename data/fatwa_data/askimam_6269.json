  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am really confused with your answer regarding Question#5949, I feel you still emphasizing the concept by saying ?So, it would be safe to say, 'If it were not for Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), the world would have not been in existence.' The heavens and earth were not created for the sake of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). They were created for the reason mentioned by Allaah in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ?It is Allaah Who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof (i.e., seven). His Command descends between them (heavens and earth), that you may know that Allaah has power over all things, and that Allaah surrounds (comprehends) all things in (His) Knowledge.?[al-Talaaq 65:12] If you read the Christian Bible- the book of John, chapter 1, verses 1 - 10. You'll see that in essence, Christains are claiming the same for Jesus. If you read the \"Kabala\", which is the Jewish Mysticism, you'll see it is almost 100% same as the Muslim Sufism. There is nothing new Bidah, in Islam, but was done by Yahood and Nusara of the old. Allah sent Muhammad saw, precisely, to crsush these ideas, but alas, we cherish them and think that these are the \"Asaas\" of our deen. Please give us clear vision of this issue according to Quran and Sunnah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThis Aayaat of Surah al-Talaaq does not testify to your claim in any way. A%0D%0Aclose study of the words in this verse will prove that this Aayat does not%0D%0Amention the purpose of creation at all. In fact, it explains the outcome of%0D%0Athat command of Allah which descends from the sky, i.e. after Allah Ta'ala%0D%0Adescends His commands - (al-Qur'aan) the revelation - you come to know that%0D%0AAllah has power over everything and that he has comprehended everything in%0D%0AHis knowledge.%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, if it were as you claimed, it could be said that since Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has been the means of us receiving this%0D%0Acommand%2Frevelation of Allah Ta'ala, and if it was not for him, we would not%0D%0Ahave been able to fulfil the purpose. So, then again, 'if it were not for%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), the world would not have been in%0D%0Aexistence.'%0D%0A%0D%0AFurthermore, the question of Sufism being an innovation or not was never%0D%0Adiscussed by us. And neither was it said to be the 'Asaas' of our Deen.%0D%0AHence, we prefer it to be left out of this correspondence. Lastly, we humbly%0D%0Arequest you to provide us with those verses from the bible, Chapter1 verses%0D%0A1 - 10 for future reference.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
