  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan you please tell me what is a man's and woman's satr in front of :\n\n1. spouse\n2. Ghayr Mahram\n3. Mahram\n4. Granchildren (meaning the satr of old people)\n5. Non-Muslims\n\nIs it okay to play with our baby cousins or other family members who might be about 5 - 8 years old, but are allowed in nikah (I have one cousin who is 3 years old i think and i always play with her and kiss her, etc.  Am I allowed to do that?)\n\nJazak-Allah for all your efforts.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is permissible for a man to look at the entire body of his wife (and vice versa). (Fataawa Mahmoodiya vol.12 pg.360). However, it is advisable not to look directly at the private parts.\n\nA man’s Satr is from below the navel to below the knees (in front of Ghayr Mahram, Mahrams and non-Muslims. (Shaami vol.1 pg.406; HM Saeed)\n\nA woman’s Satr is from head to toe in front of Ghayr Mahrams. (Shaami vol.1 pg.407; HM Saeed)\n\nA woman’s Satr in front of her Mahram is her entire body except her face, head, chest, arm and calf. However, if the woman feels that she is not safe from the desires of her Mahrams, it will not be permissible to expose even these parts. A woman’s Satr in front of other Muslim women is from her navel to below her knees, and in front of non-Muslim woman, her atr is her entire body except her face, hands, feet. And the Satr of old people in front of her grandchildren is same as the Satr for Mahrams. It is permissible to play with one’s baby cousins or other family members who are allowed in Nikah until they reach the age of sexual consciousness. (al-Fiqhul Islaam vol.4 pg.2650; Mahmoodiyah vol.17 pg.342)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
