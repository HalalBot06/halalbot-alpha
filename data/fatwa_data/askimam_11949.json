  "answer": "QUESTION\nI really would like to know who Wahabies are and what they believe in. I'am hanafi and was wondering what is the difference between us and them. Jazzakallahairun selam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Wahabis, who call themselves Salafis, are a group who had appeared in the last few centuries and hold beliefs contrary to the Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaa'ah. %0D%0A%0D%0AThey try to pull the wool over our eyes by affiliating themselves with the Salaf (Sahabah and Tabi'en) but in effect their beliefs and practices are completely in contradictory with those of the Salaf.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Wahabis are in essence Mujassimah (anthropomorphists-Those who attribute%0D%0Aa body to Allah Ta'ala). %0D%0A%0D%0AThey attribute a hand, leg, face etc to Allah Ta'ala, while the illustrious Ulama of the Ahlus sunnah wal Jama'ah hold fast to the belief that Allah knows best the meaning of these words. %0D%0A%0D%0ASimilar is the case with all the sifat (qualities) etc in the Quran ie. the Wahabis take them on there apparent meaning , claiming that interpreting the Quran is not permissible, while we say that Allah knows best what it means or at times we interpret it in a suitable manner.%0D%0A-The Wahabis reject the permissibility of using a deceased person as a intermediary in dua, while we hold that it is permissible.%0D%0A-The Wahabis reject the Ambiyaa being alive in their graves %0D%0A- The Wahabis hold that Allah is really resting on His throne in the sky, while we hold that this is from the Mutashabihaat.(Those unclear statements hose meaning is only known to Allah).%0D%0A- The Ulama of the Ahlus sunnah wal Jamaa'ah disagree with the destruction of numerous blessed historical landmarks by the Wahabis.%0D%0A-The Ulama of the Ahlus sunnah wal Jamaa'ah hold that taqleed of one mazhab is necessary, while the Wahabis generally do not adhere to a mazhab and claim that following one imam blindly is Bidah and shirk.%0D%0A-There are dozens of other differences.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Wahabis are vehement opponents of the Asharis and Maaturidis, who constitute the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama'ah and are two groups whose beliefs are correct. They also vehemently oppose tawassuf.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is necessary for us to be on our guard against them as they are very active propagators of their Baatil and false beliefs.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
