  "question": "Only to the general public, the finality of Prophethood (Khatamun Nabiyeen) means the last Prophet, this is not the correct meaning of the term",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI came across the following on some Qadiani website.\n\nOnly to the general public, the finality of Prophethood (Khatamun Nabiyeen) means the last Prophet, this is not the correct meaning of the term, for the knowledgeable people. Even if a Prophet comes after the Era of Muhammad, it will make no difference to the end of prophethood that is associated with Muhammad. (Tahzeerun Naas by  Maulana Qasim Nanotwi, page 3, 25).\n\nThere was no mention of what was before this statemnet and what was after it on the website. Maulana Qasim Nanotwi might have explained it  in the said book. WIll you please explain it.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAt the moment, I am traveling abroad and cannot easily refer to Tahzeerun Naas and the context of the statement by Ml. Qasim Nanotwi (RA).\n\nHowever, the issue of the finality of the prophethood of Rasulullah (Salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam) is absolute. He is the last prophet and there is no prophet to come after Rasulullah (Salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam). Hazrat Easa’s (AS) return to earth will be as a follower of Rasulullah (Salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
