  "question": "this hadith should not be recited in every Friday Khutbah as saying of Prophet",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n‘My companions are like starts...' in your article on this hadith, I would like you to add that this hadith should not be recited in every Friday Khutbah as saying of Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is customary in Pakistan, since its authenticity is doubtful. In case this is hadith is not correct, the scholar who recommended this despite knowing its weakness might held accountable. Please, have mercy on our scholars by issuing a new Khutbah so every hanafi Imam can recite for Friday. I know this hadith is read to develop love of sahaba, but does not necessarily have to be attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAfter reading our article on the above Hadith, one would understand that the Hadith, ‘… my companions are like starts …’ is soundly authentic. Therefore, there is absolutely nothing wrong in using this Hadith in our Jumu’ah khutbahs.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
