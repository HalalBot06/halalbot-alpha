Jazakalla Khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nWe advise you consider the feelings of your wife and not remarry. Adopting a\nchild may be a good alternative. However, you should make Istikhaara (seek\nDivine Guidance) of Allah Ta'ala before making any decision.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
