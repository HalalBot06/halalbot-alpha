  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nInvitation to Study\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nInvitation to Study\n\nan institute of higher Islamic learning based in Durban, South Africa. We also have students from United States, Canada, Belgium, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Malaysia, Phillipines, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia. The institute offers the following courses:\n• Hifzul Qur’aan (memorizing the Qur’aan): generally over 3 years depending on the ability of the student\n• I’daadiyah (introductory phase for Aalim course)\n• Imaam / Khatib Training: between 1 and 3 years. This is to equip a person to be an Imaam and fulfil basic Islamic requirements of the community, for example, perform Salaat, Jumu’ah, Nikah, etc.\n• Qiraat Hafs (normal reading) and Qiraat Sab’a (7 dialects) and Asharah (10 dialects)\n• Aalim Course 6 years\n• Mufti course: minimum 2 years\n• Specialty in Hadith: 1 year\n• Qadhaa (Islamic judiciary): 1 year after the Mufti course\n\nApart from the above mentioned courses, we also welcome anyone who wish to spend a little time from their busy schedule to experience Deeni (religious) life. We tailor the course according to time availability of the prospective student and the desired field of study. In this field, we invite school-going students (during their holidays), working class individuals (to take some time), new Muslims (to learn more about Islam) and almost anyone who wish to learn anything about Islam.\n\nThere are great virtues for a student of Deen. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘That person who treads the path in search of knowledge, Allah makes his path to Jannah easy.’ To seek a little knowledge at night is better than staying awake whole night in the worship of Allah. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘The Ulama are the heirs of the Anbiyaa (prophets).’ The prophets have left knowledge as their inheritance.\n\nRemember, Rizq and sustenance is from Allah. It is not any knowledge that provides. At most, the knowledge and skills are means. It is Allah that puts effects in these means. The west is filled with many professional and skilful people without employment. Indeed, it is Allah who is the sole provider.\n\nThe following is a summary of the syllabus of the Aalim course:\nFirst Year: Learning Arabic, mainly Sarf and Nahw.\nSecond Year: Continue with learning Arabic, Fiqh, Usool-e-Fiqh and Tarjuma-e-Qur’aan\nThird Year: Usool-e-Fiqh, Tarjuma-e-Qur’aan, History\nFourth Year: Fiqh, Usool-e-Fiqh, Tafseer\nFifth Year: Hadith, Usool-e-Hadith, Fiqh\nSixth Year: Sihaah-e-Sitta\n\nThe Aalim course is for 6 years (equivalent to BA). Our medium of instruction is English, Arabic and Urdu.\n\nThere are two levels of seeking knowledge – Fardh (compulsory) and Nafl (voluntary). It is compulsory upon a believer to seek the basic knowledge of Shari’ah – Wudhu, Ghusl, Salaat, etc. To seek intense knowledge of the Shari’ah is voluntary and act of great virtue and reward. However, being a Nafl act, Fardh will supercede it.\n\nWe urge all our readers to take heed of the above mentioned virtues of seeking knowledge of Deen and encourage youngsters to sacrifice their time and youth to become Ulama and serve the course of Deen. This is a means of enriching the Ummah and to become dynamic. Insha Allah, parents will be greatly rewarded in this life and the hereafter. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, ‘When a person passes away, all his deeds terminate with the exception of three (the reward will continue even after death), a pious child, knowledge through which people benefit, a Sadaqah jaariyah (recurring charity).’\n\nYour contribution is:\n• Educate yourself;\n• Send your Son;\n• Encourage others to come and assist them to come financially, etc."
