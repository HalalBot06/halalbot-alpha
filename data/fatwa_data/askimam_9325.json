  "question": "I have been having repeatable dreams on the same thing. Being lost, trapped in a maze of some sort, unable to escape.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nCan you help me solve my dream?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream is a Shaytaani one. The Shaytaan wishes to instil fear in you and divert your attention from fulfilling your daily chores and obedience to Allah. You should ignore the dream.\n\nWhenever you see such a dream, recite Laa hawla walaa quwwata, spit lightly in that direction and change direction of sleep. Also make Wudhu and recite the four Quls before sleeping.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
