  "question": "Taweez making",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalaams, in some books of doaas, it mentions that if you write down on paper and keep with you(as taweez) one of the names of Allah(eg. Al-Mumin) then there are certain benefits(protection from enemy etc). It it ok if we practice this for personal purposes and are there any consequences? Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta%E3la says in the Noble Qur%E3n, 'In the Qur%E3n is (spiritual, physical)%0D%0Acure for people.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThe opening chapter of the Noble Qur%E3n, Surah Faatiha is also called the%0D%0Achapter of Shifaa. It is recorded in the Bukhari Shareef vol. 1 p. , 'A%0D%0Aruler of a certain clan was stung by a creature, the people of the area%0D%0Arequested the Sahaaba to cure him, one Sahaabi read Surah Faatiha and blew%0D%0Aon the affected area and cured the ruler. The Prophet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam) even praised the Sahaabi for doing so.%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom the above quotations, it is clear that the verses of the Noble Qur%E3n is%0D%0Aa means of cure. Treating oneself with Taweez containing verses of the Qur%E3n%0D%0Ais similar to treating oneself with medication. By using medication, one%0D%0Amerely places his trust in Allah Ta%E3la and use the medication as a means of%0D%0Acure. The effect in the means is with the Will of Allah Ta%E3la so, too is the%0D%0Ausage of the Taweez.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe art of making Taweez is a science independent to other known sciences.%0D%0APeople who have studied this science are most knowledgeable to explain its%0D%0Avast understanding. One thing must be outlined at the outset is that anyone%0D%0Apractising the making of Taweez cannot ascribe (in his method and%0D%0Aapplication) partners with Allah Ta%E3la. Any act of Kufr is unacceptable in%0D%0AIslam.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe people during the time of Jaahiliyya had an incorrect belief that the%0D%0Astars and planets cause rainfall, but the Prophet (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam) dismissed that. The drawings and illustrations used in Taweez are%0D%0Alike the concepts used in geometry, etc. to arrive at a solution.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn conclusion, consider the following Hadith: Abu Khuzaymah (Radhiallaahu%0D%0A%C1nhu) narrates from his father that he asked Rasulullah (Sallallaahu %C1layhi%0D%0AWasallam), 'Inform me about Rukan (blowing in water and Taweez), medication,%0D%0Aand means of security, does it change Taqdeer (predestination)? He replied,%0D%0A'They (all the above) are within Taqdeer. (Mishk%E3t pg. 22)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
