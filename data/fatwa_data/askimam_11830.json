  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for your mail to the institute. I cannot understand why you would want to get married without your parents blessings. If your intended spouse's parents are aware of your plans, why can't your parents be part of the occasion which is supposed to bring two families together according to Islam? Marriage in Islam is not just the coming together of two individuals. Two families, clans and many individuals come together to increase the bonds of brotherhood in Islam.%0D%0A%0D%0ADo consider consulting your parents. You have to remember that when your parents shower their duas and blessings upon you, you are indeed a very fortunate man. When they look at you with love and pleasure, Allah Ta'ala is most pleased with you too. We, the offspring are expected to be the coolness of our parents eyes.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala guide you to serve your parents and to also seek their blessings and guidance, ameen.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A1SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
