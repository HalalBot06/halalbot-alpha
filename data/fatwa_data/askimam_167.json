  "question": "Is one able to make a Dua in the toilet?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSheikh Aburagheim Sallie, a resident Sheikh in South Africa Cape Town, states in one of his kitaabs, that a dua is made after one cleans his private parts. Sheikh Abduragheim learnt in Cairo and studied under Sheikh Shakie Najaar, also in Cape Town. An Arab brother told me that a Hadeeth mentioned that one cannot talk at ALL in the toilet, unless by necessity though. Is this Sheikh wrong? or is the Arab wrong? The Arab's view came from a Hadith.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Arab is correct.\n\nIt is not permissible to recite anything whilst being uncovered, for\nexample, in the\ntoilet. Probably, Shaykh Abdur-Raheem referred to a Du'aa after coming out\nof toilet.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
