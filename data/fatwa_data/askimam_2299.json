  "question": "Should I propose to a him or not?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am 18 yrs of age and consider my self at an appropiate age to marry.There is a guy in my weekend Islamic Studies class,whom I like and would like to put forward a conditinal proposal of marriage to him(i.e first ask questions about his past ,present and future plans and vice versa; to see whether we are compatiable or not). I have proformed istakarah with regards as whether or not to ask him to marry me or not.They say that after doing the istakarah, then you should follow the path your heart is inclined to most.My heart is more inclined to the idea of proposing to him.I do not know any thing about his character other than what I see in the class. There is no way of finding out more about his character since I do not know any of his friends or family. I am not sure whether or not he is interested in me, but I would like to know one way or another;if he isn`t than I can look else where for a marriage partner. What should I do, propose or not?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMarriage is a major step in life and you should exercise precaution before\ntaking any positive steps in that direction. We advise that you also discuss\nthe matter with your parents and seek their advice. Probably, they will\nassist you in finding.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
