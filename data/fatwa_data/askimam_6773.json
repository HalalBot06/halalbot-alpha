  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti, if a girl starts her period for the first time in Ramadan, what should she do? I am asking u this question because I cant seem to reconcile two contradictory rulings found in the classical fiqh manuals. Firstly they say that it is haraam for a woman on her period to fast and also it is haram for her to act like a fasting person but then they also sat that if a child attains puberty he/she should refrain from all those things which invalidate the fast (i.e act like a fasting person). Please kindly explain.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Fuqaha have cited the following explanation for the above masala.\n\nA girl who attains puberty (during the day of the days of Ramadaan) now becomes eligible for fasting. Since her condition of menses will not permit her to keep her fast, she should at least act like a fasting person. Similarly would be the case of a mature woman who experiences her menses whilst fasting. i.e. she would act like a fasting person.\n\nWhilst a woman who has her menses prior to the fasting day commencing is not eligible in Shariah to fast. Therefore, Shariah does not instruct her to act like a fasting person. (Hidaya Vol.1 Pg.225)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
