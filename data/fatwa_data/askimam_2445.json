  "question": "Is it permissable to use hair remover creams, if yes which is better shaving or hair removers.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe following is an extract from Bahisti Zewar, which answers your question.%0D%0A%0D%0ARules concerning hair%0D%0A%0D%0A1. It is sunnah to grow one's hair on the entire head till the ear lobes or%0D%0Aslightly below them. If a person wishes to shave his head, it is sunnah to%0D%0Ashave the entire head. It is also permissible to merely clip the hair.%0D%0AHowever, it is not permissible to clip all the hair and leave the front%0D%0Aportion long, as is the fashion today. Similarly, it is also not permissible%0D%0Ato shave a portion and leave another portion long. From this we deduce that%0D%0Ait is not permissible to sport the babri hairstyle (or to cut the hair in%0D%0Athe shape of a cap or to shape the front part of the hair).%0D%0A2. If the hair has been lengthened considerably, it is not permissible to%0D%0Atie it into a tail like women.%0D%0A3. It is har%E2m for women to shave the head or clip the hair on the head. The%0D%0AHadith has cursed such women.%0D%0A4. It is sunnah to clip the moustache to such an extent that it is clipped%0D%0Ato the skin. There is a difference of opinion with regard to shaving the%0D%0Amoustache. According to some it is a bid'ah, while others have permitted it.%0D%0ACaution demands that one does not shave it.%0D%0A5. It is permissible to lengthen the moustache on the sides on the condition%0D%0Athat the area above the lips is not lengthened.%0D%0A6. It is har%E2m to shave or clip the beard. However, it is permissible to%0D%0Aclip it if it is longer than the length of one fist. Similarly, it is%0D%0Apermissible to clip it on all the sides in such a way that it becomes neat%0D%0Aand straight (provided it is beyond one fist).%0D%0A7. It is permissible to clip the hair and straighten the hair line that%0D%0Agrows on the cheeks. Similarly, it is also permissible to straighten and cut%0D%0Athe eyebrows a wee bit.%0D%0A8. The hair on the throat should not be shaven. However, it has been related%0D%0Afrom Ab%FB Y%FBsuf rahmatull%E2hi 'alayh that there is no harm in this.%0D%0A9. Shaving the hair of the lower lip is regarded as a bid'ah by the jurists.%0D%0ATherefore this should not be done. Similarly, they have said that it is%0D%0Amakruh to remove the hair that is on the nape of the neck.%0D%0A%0D%0A10. It is not permissible to pluck out grey hairs merely for the purposes of%0D%0Abeautification. However, it is better for the muj%E2hid%EEn to do so in order to%0D%0Ainstil fear and awe in the hearts of the enemy.%0D%0A11. The hair of the nose should not be tweezed out. Instead, it can be%0D%0Aclipped.%0D%0A12. It is permissible to remove the hair that is on the chest and back.%0D%0AHowever, it is not good to do so.%0D%0A13. It is preferable for men to remove the hair of the pubic region from%0D%0Ajust below the navel onwards. When shaving, they should commence from below%0D%0Athe navel. It is also permissible to use sulphurate of arsenic and other%0D%0Apreparations (such as hair-removing creams, etc.) to remove the hair of the%0D%0Apubic region. As for women, the sunnah method is that they should remove the%0D%0Ahair of the pubic region by pinching it out or tweezing it out and that they%0D%0Ashould not use a shaving machine.%0D%0A14. It is preferable to remove the hair of the arm pits by tweezing them.%0D%0AHowever, it is permissible to shave them.%0D%0A15. As for the hair of the balance of the body, it is permissible to shave%0D%0Ait or retain it.%0D%0A16. It is also sunnah to clip the nails of the feet. However, it is mustahab%0D%0Afor the person who is engaged in jihad not to clip his moustache and nails.%0D%0A17. It is preferable to clip the finger nails in the following order:%0D%0Acommence with the index finger of the right hand until you reach the little%0D%0Afinger. Thereafter, commence with the little finger of the left hand until%0D%0Ayou reach the thumb of the left hand. Thereafter, complete by clipping the%0D%0Athumb of the right hand. As for the toe nails, commence with the little toe%0D%0Aof the right foot and end with the little toe of the left foot. This is the%0D%0Apreferable method. However, it is permissible to clip in any way that may be%0D%0Acontrary to this method.%0D%0A18. Clipped nails and hair should be buried. If they are not buried, they%0D%0Ashould at least be kept in a safe place. However, they should not be kept in%0D%0Aany impure, dirty place as there is the fear of falling ill.%0D%0A19. It is not good to bite the finger nails as this is a cause of leprosy.%0D%0A20. It is makruh to trim the hair, clip the nails and remove pubic hair%0D%0Awhile one is in a state of impurity.%0D%0A%0D%0A21. It is preferable to remove the pubic hair, hair of the arm-pits, nails,%0D%0Ato have a bath and cleanse oneself at least once a weak. It is best to do%0D%0Aall this on a Friday before going for the jumu'ah sal%E2t. If one cannot do%0D%0Athis on a weekly basis, he should carry it out every fortnight. If not, at%0D%0Aleast every forty days. There is no concession beyond forty days. If forty%0D%0Adays expire and the person does not carry out the above, he will be%0D%0Acommitting a sin.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A"
