  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nRecently I received a mail from a friend which adviced to receite following duas and some more good Islamic material and hadith.\n\nThe mail adviced us to send to atleast 7 people so that minimum 7 people would gain from the email and also they would have receited a Dua for the sender. The mail further stated we should try sending to all our muslim contacts and lets try to reach atleast 5 million musllims overall in 7 days. At the end the mail clearly stated that if we dont send the email to anyone nothing will happen, so theres no superstition or curse involved.\n\nMy question was is such kind of setting target to send atleast to 7 people or setting target to reach 5 million muslims in 7 days allowed as per Islamic Shariah ? Since the mail clearly mentioned nothing will happen even if we dont sent it, does inspite of that due to that fact that the mail said lets send atleast to 7 people contribute to any kind of superstition or any other sin ?\n\nFollowing are the duas mentioned in the mail :\n\n* SUBHANA'LLAH\n\n* ALHAMDULI'LLAH\n\n* LA I LAHA ILLA'LLAH\n\n* ALLAHU AKBAR\n\n* ASTAGHFIRU'LLAH\n\n* LA ILAH ILLA'LLAH, MUHAMMADUN RASULU'LLAH\n\n* ALLAHUMMA SALLY WA SALLEM WABAREK ALA SAYYEDINA MUHAMMAD WA AALIHE WA SAHBIH AJMA'EEN\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is permissible to circulate the du’aas to an unlimited number of people.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
