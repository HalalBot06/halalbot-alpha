  "question": "how many times can a person have sex with wife per day? What if she doesnt like it a lot?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShari?ah has commanded us to be moderate in all affairs and not to exceed the bounds. This is also logical.\n\nAnything in exaggeration can lead to harm. The amount of times a person can cohabit with his wife in a day is a mutual affair between the spouses. Most definitely, intercourse should generate love and compassion between the couple and not rejection. If the wife is not too inclined, then the spouses should be open and communication should be free between the two. They should sit down and discuss the matter. The husband should be more accommodating and not too direct in his approach thereby giving the impression that intercourse was the only reason of marriage.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
