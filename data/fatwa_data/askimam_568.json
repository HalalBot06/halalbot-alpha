  "question": "If the wife is refusing to put Hijaab, is it wrong to divorce her?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are two aspects here:\nOne is I?elaam (to inform) and the other is I?emaal (to make others practice). Informing is merely a means of making others practice. The purpose (to make others practice) should be placed first and then wisdom should be applied in trying to achieve the purpose.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
