  "question": "Can we charge a fee for late rental payments?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWe have given apartments for rent. Some times the tenant dose not pay the rent according to the agreed date. Is it ok to take fine? Beacuse if are taking a fine then they will be forced to pay the rent before due date. Will taking fine be riba?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nIt is not permissible to charge a fine on late rental payments.\n\nAn alternative is to inflate the rent by 10% and if anyone pays timeously, they will be offered a 10% discount.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
