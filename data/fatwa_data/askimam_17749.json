No surviving parens and no surving children.\nWho inherits and what would be their legitimate shares.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nWhen a person passed away firstly, the burial expenses would be paid for. This should not be too extravagant neither should it be thrifty. Thereafter, all debts, if any, will be paid off. This will be paid for from the entire estate. Thereafter, all bequests, if any will be fulfilled. This will be paid from one third of what ever remains after paying all debts. Thereafter, the remainder will be distributed to their respective inheritors.\n\nThe sister will inherit half the estate of the deceased.\n\nNone of the nieces will inherit.\n\nNephews (sisters sons) also will not inherit.\n\nThe remainder will be equally divided among the nephews (brothers sons).\n\n \n\n \n\nالعصبات النسبية ثلاثة عصبة بنفسه...\n\nالسراجي 14\n\n \n\n(المال كله للعم دون العمة) وكذا الحال في ابن العم مع بنت العم لاب وام او لاب وفي ابن الاخ مع بنت الاخ لاب [وام او لاب]\n\nشرح الجرجاني 84\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
