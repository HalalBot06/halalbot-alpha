If the delay is from the husband’s side, his excuse of not completely married for not fulfilling his marital obligations is not correct.\n\nOnce the Nikah is performed, the married is complete. The husband must fulfill his marital obligations to his wife. If he fails to do so, he will be sinful.\n\nNevertheless, you should exercise restraint until you are with your husband to fulfill your base desires, physical and emotional.\n\nYou cannot fulfill your base desires through anyone else.\n\nIf you do so, you will be sinful for committing such an immorality. Yes, if your husband is negligent in staying with you after marriage and not fulfilling your base desires, he too will be sinful for his negligence as well as being a cause for you to commit sin.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
