Whats the best way to learn Arabic? I'm live in a small town so there are not many Arabs here that I can talk to and also absolutely no Mosques Thank you for your reply. I can't wait to learn more about this religion. All praise due to Allah!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe wish to advise that there is no difficulty in Islam. You should try your level best to perform your Salaat. However, if you are unable to do so for reasons beyond your control, you will be excused and can make Qadhaa (make-up) at a later stage for the missed Salaats.\n\nWe suggest you befriend a dedicated Muslim and request him to teach you to recite the Qur'aan.\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
