  "question": "Is it true that even if a hair's breadth of space on any part of skin on any part of the body (e.g. roots of hair) remains dry while performing ghusl, the ghusl would not be done?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n(2) Is it permissible during ghusl to wash the hands and private parts seperately from the rest of the ghusl procedure? (3) This last question may be a bit lengthy for you: can you tell me the procedure for performing Ghusl from water flowing from a (3i) movable and flexible pipe (3ii) falling from a fixed shower. The last problem has brought to me the most troubles.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is true that even if a hair's breadth of space remains dry, the Wudhu\nor Ghusl will be invalid. However, if one takes precaution in washing by\nrubbing the limbs and body after pouring the water, it is certain that the\nwater will cover every portion of the body.\n2. In Ghusl, the hands are washed first and thereafter the private parts. If\none wishes to wash the hands and private parts separately thereafter, he/she\nmay do so.\n3. The Mustahabb procedure is to pour the right and thereafter on the left.\nThat is possible by using a flexible pipe. In a fixed shower, the right side\nof the body should be directed to the shower and thereafter the left side of\nthe body so that the right side gets washed before the left side.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
