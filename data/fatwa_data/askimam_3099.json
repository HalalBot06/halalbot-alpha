  "answer": "QUESTION\n1.Please explain the correct belief that we should have in Rasullah SAW. Is he alive in his grave? Did he pass away like regular humans. 2. Please explain the concept of tasawul in islam. That is invoking Allah help through the means of some pious people. People say that this was done at the time of Rasullah and Sahabah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Haazir (Omnipresent) and Naazir (Omniseeing) are the sole attributes of\nAllah.\nNo human being including our Nabiy (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) can be\nHaazir and Naazir. Our beloved Rasul (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is\nresting in Madinah Munawwarah. He informed us that when anyone sends Salaams\nto him, the angels convey the Salaam to him there.\n\n2. Hadhrat Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) used to make Du'aa for rain through the\nWaseela of Hadhrat Abbas (Radhiallaahu Anhu), the uncle of Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). However, in view of the misconception in\nWaseela, it is important to note that it is not permissible to make Du'aa to\nanybody besides Allah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
