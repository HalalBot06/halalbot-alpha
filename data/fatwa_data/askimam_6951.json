  "answer": "QUESTION\ni am completely frustrated. I am 28 yr old female and i have done everything for nikaah. prayed surah dhar, 500 durood, frequent duas. nothing seems to work. i dont know why allah is testing me so much , i would rather die. i am at a point where i have trouble believing that Allah will even do good for me, everyone around me is getting married and that too with great people. Does he hate me for some reason? i have asked for forgiveness, for h elp, for m ercy...nothing works.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNo, Allah Ta?ala does not hate his servants. He loves them more than a mother loves her infant.\n\nOur marriage partners are determined by Allah Ta?ala before we were born. Allah is well aware of who is most suitable for you. Perhaps your partner has been decreed to join you a little later than you anticipate. Perhaps there was Khayr (goodness) in you not getting married all these years. Take solace from the fact that Allah Ta?ala wants the best for His servants. Continue making Du?aa. Also, perform Salaatul Haajat and make Du?aa.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
