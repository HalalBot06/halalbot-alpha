  "question": "Can a product containing “Gelatine” be applied externally onto the body?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have purchased a product that is to be applied externally onto the body. The product helps strengthen the bones and in particular promotes growth. However, this product contains ?Gelatine?. Although I am not consuming this but applying it externally, is this alright according to shariah? Also, can I pray salat with Gelatine on my body?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe cannot comment on the source of gelatine used in this product. Many\nproducts nowadays have adequate alternatives. Therefore, if there is an\nadequate alternative, you should use that. If there is no alternative for a\nmedication, it is permissible to use medicine that contains gelatine.\n\nThe medication should be preferably applied during the night so that no\nSalaat may be performed with the product on your body. However, if it is\nnecessary to apply it during the day, you will be excused from performing\nSalaat with it.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
