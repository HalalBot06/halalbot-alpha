  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs Worshiping Sai Baba, Saint / Fakir called in India is Allowed or Dissallowed , Jayaz Or najayaz for  a muslim....\nIn India Some Muslim People Believe that he was a fakir and was muslim.& they do not hesitate to worship Saibaba..\nAre they Doing Shirk, is Believing in SaiBaba Shirk in Islam...Please Tell me..\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIslam teaches us that there is no one worthy of worship, but Allah. Worshipping anyone else besides Allah is shirk, and takes the person out of the fold of Islam. Anyone involved in shirk will not be regarded as a Muslim. If anyone involves himself in shirk unknowingly, then he has to read the Kalimah again, remarry his wife if married and repent to Allah Ta’ala for his sins.\n\nSai Baba had beliefs that were contrary to the beliefs of Islam. If, per say, he was a saint, then too it will not be permissible to worship him, as Allah Ta’ala alone has right to be worshipped.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
