  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf I arrived in the mosque and could not catch up with the imam in the last ruku, does this mean that I missed the jamat? If there is another person with me should I wait till the first jamat has finished so that we can perform a second jamat, or shall I join the first jamat even if in last tashahud?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf you missed the ruku of the last rakaat of Salaat, then too you should join the Jamaat. You should not make another Jamaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
