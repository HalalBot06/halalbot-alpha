  "question": "If a non-Muslim were to convert to Islam, would he need to get circumsized to be a full Muslim???",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nBesides circumcision, does this person have to tell his family members?? They are strict Sikh's and would never approve. He is learning about Islam now and is wanting to convert but without telling his parents. Obviously they will find out later, but for now they won't know. Is a female allowed to marry such a person who has converted to Islam without the approval of his parents?? Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nIt is advisable for a revert to Islam to circumcise. However, it is not a\nprerequisite for the validity of accepting Islam.\n\nDue to the circumstances explained, the person in question does not have to\ninform his family members immediately. It is permissible for a female to\nmarry a person who has recently reverted to Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
