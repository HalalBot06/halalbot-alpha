  "question": "Could you please provide for me a definition of what is a \"Bida'\" in terms of the Islamic Sharia?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe word ?Bid?ah? literally means innovations. In Shari?ah, it means to introduce something new in Deen which was never done before and not part of Deen.%0D%0A%0D%0AThere are two types of innovations, a) Regarded as Deen ? this is absolutely Haraam, and b) Not regarded as Deen, e.g. computers, technology, plans, etc. ? this is not Haraam.%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom this, the majority Ulama agreed upon this that there is Bid?at Hasanah and Bid?ah Sayyi-a%0D%0A%0D%0Aa) Bid?at Hasanah ? everything that is beneficial and does not contradict nor go against the Qur?aan and Sunnah. It is acceptable and falls under Bid?ah Hasanah, e.g. construction of Madaaris, hospitals, library, compilation of books. In a Hadeeth Shareef, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) encourages us towards those works that will benefit us without going against the Qur?aan and Sunnah.%0D%0A%0D%0Ab) Bid?ah Sayyi-ah is that which goes agains the Qur?aan and Sunnat. This is absolutely Haraam, e.g. forming another way of worship, etc. (Maqaalat Kawthari pg.111)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
