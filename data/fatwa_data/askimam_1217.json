  "question": "Umrah: Where is the miqaat, and what length should I shorten my hair?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nInshAllah, I plan to go to Umrah next month for the first time. Would you please help me with these two questions. 1. I have heard two different answers as to where the Miqaat is and when I put on the Ihram. One view tells me I can wear the Ihram in Jeddah the day I go to Mecca. The other tells me I must put on Ihram on the plane flying from American to Jeddah within 20-30 minutes before arriving and that it will be announced. Which one is the correct halal answer for Miqaat and Ihram? 2. Also I'm hearing two viewpoints regarding the shaving of the hair after Umrah. One view is that I should shave the entire head or cut all the hair very short and the other is that I need only to cut a small size of hair as a symbol. Please tell me the answer to this. Jazakum Allah Khairan. If you could please answer me quickly I would appreciate it.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If you intend going to Makkah Mukarramah first, you should put on your\nIhraam before crossing the Meeqaat in the plane.\n2. After performing Umrah, it is advisable to shave the entire head. It is\nalso permissible to shorten all the hair. It is incorrect to cut as a\nsymbol.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
