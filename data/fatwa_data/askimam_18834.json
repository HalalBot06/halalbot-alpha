Get married to someone else like my sister??\n\n2-      Or get married to the person I want??\n\nPlzzzz help me in my problem\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nAt the outset, we understand that you are currently engaged in a relationship with a strange man. This is Haraam and prohibited in Islam. You should desist from further engaging with any stranger as the curse of Allah will always remain upon you until your relationship with a stranger seizes. You may only interact with a stranger once you have made Nikah and you become legal husband and wife.\n\n \n\nNevertheless, after studying the contents of your mail, we suggest that you motivate some influential friends or associates of your parents to make them agree to allow you to marry someone of your choice. It is important that you also hear your parents view on the matter as they may have some genuine concerns regarding the boy which you do not know. It is wise to listen to them as well so that you may not have any future regrets. Your parents will never wish evil and wrong for you. You are their blood and flesh and their love for you is never ending. Consult them, take their blessings and Duas and thereafter experience the unseen help and assistance from Allah.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n\n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftāa"
