  "question": "How to make up missed prayers?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamu alaikym, I used to masturbate for a long time [years].  I only recently found out that it is Haram and that you must make ghusl before you pray.  Does the mean that I have to pray all of those salahs from before again?  [I can’t remember how many I would have to.]  Is there something else I should do or make up for?  May Allah bless you all for answering our questions. Ameen\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nMasturbation is prohibited and necessitates ghusl.[i][ii]\n\nYou have mentioned that you usedto involve yourself in the filthy and detested act of masturbation.  Hence, we are delighted to know that you are no longer engaged in that evil act.  We make dua that Allah Ta’ala grant you strength and steadfastness.Ameen.\n\nAs a general principle, after reaching puberty, any FardhSalaator Witrprayed without performing Ghusl after committing the vile act in reference would have to be repeated.Since you cannot remember exactly how many years of Salaat you have to repeat, estimate the number of Salaats performed in that condition and make up accordingly.  An easy method would be to repeat one missed prayer after every Farz and WaajibSalaat you perform.[iii]  Hence if three years of Salaat was missed then after three years all the Salaats would be made up.\n\nAlong with making up these Salaats, repent for the sin of masturbation and make a firm resolution never to return to the sinful act again.  Allah Taala states in the Glorious Quran:\n\nان الله يغفر الذنوب جميعا (سورة الزمر اية 53\n\nTranslation: Surely Allah will forgive all sins (Surah Az-Zumar, Ayat #53)\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMawlana Abdul Azeem bin Abdur Rahman,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\nUS\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMufti Ebrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net\n\n\n\n\n[i]وَلَا يَحِلُّ الِاسْتِمْنَاءُ بِالْكَفِّ ذَكَرَ الْمَشَايِخُ فِيهِ أَنَّهُ عَلَيْهِ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ قَالَ:  نَاكِحُ الْيَدِ مَلْعُونٌ(فتح القدير, ج2 ,ص256)\n\n[ii]فصل :ما يوجب الاغتسال: يفترض الغسل بواحد من سبعة أشياء خروج المني الى ظاهر الجسد إذا انفصل عن مقره بشهوة من غير جماع(نور الايضاح, ص 27, المكتبة العصرية)\n\n[iii]AapKeMasaailAur Un Ka Hal, Vol. 2, pages 412-414"
