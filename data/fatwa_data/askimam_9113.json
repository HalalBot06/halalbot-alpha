  "question": "Is it right to see sexy pics and movies. if no, what is its punishment",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Haraam (prohibited) to look at pictures or movies of such a nature.%0D%0A%0D%0ABy looking at such filthy literature, a person's modesty and shame is lost. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said, 'When the quality of Hayaa (modesty) is lost, then man can do whatever he wishes.'%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AQ: Is it permissible to sell magazines that have un-Islamic contents, for example, gossip, etc. and also expose pictures of naked or semi-naked women such as ?You?, ?Femina?, ?Fair Lady?, ?People?, etc? In some cases, this is an integral part and the ?main line? of the business, whilst in other cases, such magazines are displayed for pasttime at waiting rooms in hospitals, receptions, surgeries, etc. What is the ruling regarding these magazines?%0D%0A%0D%0AA: It is with absolute regret and remorse that Muslim businesses have lost their shame and modesty at the price of petty gain. The income received from such dirt can never be Halaal. Furthermore, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, ?Angels do not enter a house which portrays pictures.? (Bukhari). Indeed, the mercy and blessings of Allah is far, nay, extremely far from such businesses. Such businessmen have sunken into depths of darkness and ignorance selling and displaying magazines of filth, immorality, shamelessness and nudity. Some of these women posing for such obscene pictures are hijacked and forced to do so whilst others do so voluntarily. In any case, the consequences of businesses displaying such filth is absolutely frightening. Teenage boys and girls look at such filth, thereby arousing their sexual desires, only to lead to masturbation, homosexuality, adultery and a corrupt society. %0D%0AThus, it is compulsory on every businessman and any other person displaying such evil and filth in his reception or anywhere else, to get rid of such magazines completely by burning them for example. The income derived from such magazines is Haraam. We urge everyone to promote Shari?ah compliance in their business and all walks of life and to get rid of these magazines. This will definitely be ?the sure way towards attaining Barakah?."
