Your experience is another example of the consequences of such Haraam and evil relationships.\n\nWe hope our readers will take heed to our warnings and abstain from having any contact whatsoever with a girl or vice versa before marriage. The marriage may not even materialise as in your case. The girl is simply used and dumped. There is no point in you accusing her by having affairs with others. You cannot prove your innocence with this form of defense. We advise you discuss the matter once again with your family and make a proper decision.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
