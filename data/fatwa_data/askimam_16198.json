  "question": "Do we have to do Nikah again after getting 1 divorce?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have got the first divorce and we decided to get back together Allhamdollelah..... but its been few days passed my third preiod... I need to know if we need to remarry by the Imam ... as its only been few days passed my thirds cycle... please let me know as soon as possible\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIf your husband issued you a talaq-e-baain (an irrevocable divorce), and your’ll wish to reconcile, then it is necessary to have a re-performance of the Nikah.\n\nIf your husband issued you a talaq-e-raji (a revocable divorce) and your’ll wish to reconcile with the iddat period of three menses, then there is no need to renew the Nikah. If the iddat terminated, then the Nikah has to be renewed even if the iddat elapsed only by three days.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
