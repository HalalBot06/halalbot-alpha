  "answer": "QUESTION\nI'm trying to make a habit of practicing the sunnah by reading the relevant duaa before doing anything, e.g. reading the duaa before I enter the toilet, when I leave the toilet, before sleeping, etc. 1. If I'm in a state where I need to make ghusl, e.g. after I have intercourse with my wife, can I still read these duaa's? 2. What can a person do when he/she is in this state and what can't they do? 3. Can we even say these things in our mind?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. You can read these duas in the state of Janabah.\n\n2. You can make zikr, read dua's even read parts of the quran which are read as a dua not as tilawah (recitation) eg. Ayatul Kursi ,the end of surah Baqarah and the 3 quls before sleeping etc.\n\n3. You should say it with your tongue.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
