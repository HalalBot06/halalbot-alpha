  "question": "Dealing with an obsession with cleansing ones hands and body, accompanied with bad thoughts.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nFor the last three months or so a friend of mine who is a 19 year old male muslim has been experiencing an extremely difficult problem that is having a terrible effect on his life and state of mind. He has been experiencing an obsessive compulsion with washing his hands and his body because he fears that there may be traces of urine or secretion on his hands, and he feels dirty. The process can be so time-consuming that sometimes he will spend 3 hours in the shower washing various parts of his body again and again,and when he is finally done, he feels frustrated and confused because he does not understand why he does this. He says that when he is washing himself, evil thoughts enter his mind (he will not elaborate on what sort of evil thoughts they are) and this distracts him from washing, so he ends up doing the entire process again and again. He usually feels the need to perform this washing process after going to the bathroom, or when he experiences tension in his groin area. This problem is having a serious effect on my friend. Just the other day he called me crying, wondering if maybe he is 'cursed' because he does not know what to do or how to deal with this problem. I know that this behavior is not normal...please give me advice on what he should do...\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour friend seems to be experiencing a problem by being doubtful about\nthings he just did. This is in reality whispters from Shaytaan.\n\nShaytaan can never see a person value time. Therefore, he looks for\ndifferent ways to distract a person and to make him waste time. This is one\nsuch way and attempt by Shaytaan. The solution to this problem is that your\nfriend needs to build up confidence in himself and gain conviction, reality\nand awareness of what he is doing. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)\nadvised with regards to similar situation that one should make the following\nDu'aa, 'O Allah! I seek protection in you from Walahaan'. Walahan is the\nagent of Shaytaan, one who creates doubt in the minds of people. Together\nwith your friend constantly reading this Du'aa, you should speak to him\nabout ways to build up confidence and awareness in himself.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
