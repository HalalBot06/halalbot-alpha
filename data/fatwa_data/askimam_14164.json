  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1) i want to ask that can i bleach my face specially my eye brows just make them equal becoz i have never done plucking nor i want to do it 2)can a female wear baggy jeans with a big long shirt which i sort of pakistani kameez not like a men's shirt with it,and which covers her back,and which does not show her body figure..i do wear these in means of covering n not exposing my body shape...is clothing means of that it should be cover all part of the body and also for not exposing teh body .. can u plz help me\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt will be permissible to bleach the eyebrows as it is permissible to dye the hair.\n\nIt is not permissible to wear such clothes that expose the shape of the body. Muslim females are instructed to wear Jilbaab, i.e. such a garment which totally covers body and also conceals the shape of the body. In our opinion, no long shirt can fulfil these 2 requirements. The shirt would probably reveal the shape of some part of the body.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
