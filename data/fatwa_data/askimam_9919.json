  "question": "plz tell me any duaa for my father...health of my father (memory loss) is still persisting",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have written so many times abt my father?s health and problem we are facing, it?s 9 months now, but health of my father (memory loss) is still persisting. My mother, my sisters we all are praying for his speedy recovery, since he cannot read namaz right now. Life is very difficult. I know Allah will listen one day, but when. We all are praying, day and night, doing Sadaqah but still the wait is never ending, plz tell me any duaa for his speedy recovery and happiness in my family\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nJazakallah for writing to the institute regarding your father's health and your family's concerns about him.%0D%0A%0D%0APlease tell me exactly what illness your father has been diagnosed with and what his age is. Health is a gift from Allah Ta'ala and illness too is a mercy from Allah Ta'ala. Remember that Allah Ta'ala tested his beloved prophet, Ayub (alayhis salaam) with grave and severe tests throughout his life. If you recall, he lost his whole family, all his servants, cattle, his house and all that he owned in a calamity. What did he do when this awesome disaster hit him? He made sabr, performed salaah and gave thanks to his Creator. When he developed the most terribly ugly and putrid skin disease where maggots were feeding off his skin, he made sabr. Each time a maggot fell off his skin, he picked it up and placed it back onto his skin so that it could go on feeding on him. He noted that Allah Ta'ala had placed the risq for those creatures on his skin and he could not deprive them their meals. In time Allah Ta'ala granted him perfect health and restored his worldly possessions to him. He still remained devoted to Allah Ta'ala. Loss and wealth were not as important to him as the love and pleasure of Allah Ta'ala. %0D%0A%0D%0AThe lesson we learn from this patient Prophet of Allah Ta'ala is that we should accept the good and bad which comes our way and trust in Allah Ta'ala with patience and perseverance. Only Allah Tamale knows why he places certain tests before us. We should not question nor doubt Him. Instead we should accept His will and try our best to earn His pleasure by coping with our difficulties by sincerely asking His assistance. We cannot achieve anything on our own. Allah Ta'ala is \"As-Samad\", the Independent. We are the one's who are dependent on him in every way. So when you say that you and your family have been making lots of dua and you have been giving sadqa for Allah Ta'ala's pleasure, rest assured that these good deeds are being written down for your father and for all of you. You want to know \"when will Allah Ta'ala listen\". Brother, Allah Ta'ala is omnipresent, omnipotent and He hears all, sees all and knows all. Our task is not to question Allah Ta'ala why. We are to say, \"Inna lillaahi wa inna ilayhi%0D%0Ara'jioon\" whenever a calamity hits us.%0D%0A%0D%0AAt that very moment when we remember Him in our difficulty, He remembers us in a greater gathering of angels and He sends them to prepare treasure for us in Jannah which we cannot even fathom the worth of in this dunya. %0D%0A%0D%0APlease do not despair if your father cannot perform his salaah. If he has lost his memory, he is not accountable for missing his salaah. He is fortunate because he is excused as he is not mentally capable to do so. He will not have to make up these salaah if, as you say he has lost his memory. Depending on what is wrong with him, try and stimulate him in encouraging ways to help him with his memory. Try not to overtire him nor expect too much of him. Take your guidelines from his doctor and leave the rest to Allah Ta'ala. Recite the Quran and make zikr next to him as often as you can, read books on Hadith etc by sitting next to him and keep him comfortable. Yours and your family's concern, care and love for your father is recognized by your Creator and insha'allah all of you will be rewarded greatly in this world and the aagirah for your efforts. May Allah Ta'ala restore your father to sound health and may He grant all of you greater faith and trust in His plans. Ameen. %0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0ASister Fadila%0D%0ASOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
