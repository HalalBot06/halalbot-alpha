  "question": "The Holy Quran read in English Verses the Quran read in Arabic. Why is it better to read the Quran in Arabic, please substantiate your reply",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhy is it better to read the Quran in Arabic, please substantiate your reply. Surely if you read the Quran in a language foreign to your own it will mean nothing to you? I have experienced this with my husband who can read the Arabic and when I tell him about the stories and things I've read in the Quran in english he doesn't know what I'm talking about! Surely that is not right and no reward will come from reading something with your head and not with your whole heart and with understanding?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe words of the Qur?aan as well as the meanings are both important.\n\nThere is great virtue in reading only the words of the Qur?aan. However a person should endeavour to study the Qur?aan and also understand the message of Allah. It is also incorrect to concentrate only on the message and understanding the Qur?aan while not making tilawaat (recitation) of the Qur?aan.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
