  "question": "Where is Allah SWT?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome people say Allah is everywhere. Some say Allah is above the heavens on his throne. Please explain using references to Quraan and Hadith.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSaadu-deen Taftazani has explained the aspect of 'Where is Allah' in the following words, 'And he is not at any place'. (Sharh Aqaaid)\n\nImaam Maalik was asked about the Aayat in Surah Taaha, 'Allah is above His Ársh', he answered 'Being above (Istawaa) is known but the reality is unknown and - questioning that - is innovation.' Jaaluddin Suyyuti also comments on the Aayat saying, 'Istawaa (being above) according to whatever is appropriate for Allah. (Jalaalayn vol. 2 p. 260).\n\nHowever, the verse does not speak about the Zaat of Allah Taãla being on the Ársh but it is to indicate the establishment and control of the Kingdom of Allah by Himself.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
