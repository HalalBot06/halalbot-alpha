  "question": "Pls could u fully explain marriage and taqdeer? If it is in your taqdeer to get married to a girl,will u get married to this girl no matter what",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI know that Allah SWT has already put out our marriage partner. If it is in your taqdeer to get married to a girl,will u get married to this girl no matter what,even if u dont make an effort and only thru duah.Will Allah create the situation for this to take place and will he control the emotions in your heart to love this girl he has chosen for u. 2.Is there a duah for Allah SWT to send your partner sooner. 3.Can a non muslim girl become muslim without changing her name?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. This world is a place of adopting means. Together with Du?aa, one still has to make an effort. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to make Du?aa throughout the night and still make an effort during the day so that the people may accept his noble message. However, it is possible that Almighty Allah creates the means even without any effort.\n\n2. Some Ulama prescribe the following Aayat to be recited after every Fardh Salaat, ?Rabbi inniy limaa anzalta ilayya min khayrin faqeer.? (Surah Qasas 24)\n\n3. Changing of the name is not a prerequisite for the validity of her Islam. However, it is better to do so for identifying oneself with Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
