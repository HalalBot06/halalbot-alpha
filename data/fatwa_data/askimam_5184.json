  "question": "What is the difference between “Al-A’laa” and “Al-Azeem”? How does this compare with the definition of “Taa’la”, like in “Allah Subhana-wa-Taala”?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease help me understand this.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAl-A'alaa means 'most high' and 'lofty' and Al-Azeem means 'the greatest'.\n\nThe meaning of Ta'ala is similar to that of al-A'alaa referring to the\nloftiness of Allah and him being most exalted. Al-Azeem refers to the\ngreatness of Allah Ta'ala in that He is the owner of all Power, might and\nstrength and everything besides Allah Ta'ala is small and insignificant.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
