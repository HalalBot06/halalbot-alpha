  "question": "a musafir joins the salaat of ASR in fourth rakaat and prays one rakaat with the Imaam. After the imaam finishes salaat, Is the musafir required to pray three more rakaats ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf a musafir joins the salaat of (say) ASR in the fourth rakaat and prays one rakaat with the Imaam. So after the imaam finishes his salaat, Is this musafir required to pray the three more rakaats or he will just pray one more rakaat? 2. if the Imaam of the jamat is musafir and he says salam after two rakaats then what will be the procedure to complete the salat for the local people.? Will they complete the remaining two rakaats individually. Do they have to say salaam with with the imaam or will they stand up to complete their two rakaats as imam says salam? 3. Similarly if a musafir joins the jamat of say (ASR), which is being lead by a ?musafir Imaam?, in the second rakaat, and does not know about whether Imaam is musafir or local and does not know about the number of rakaats completed. What niyat he will make? And how many rakaats he will pary after the Imaam completes his salaat.?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. He is required to offer 3 more Rakaats.\n2. They should stand up and complete the remaining two Rakaats. They will\nnot recite any Qiraat or Surah Faatiha in these two Rakaats. Rather, they\nwill remain silent for this duration. The Tasbeehs of Ruku, Sajdah,\nTashahhud, etc. would be recited as normal.\n3. In principle, if a Musaafir (traveler) does not know the condition of the\nImaam (if he Musaafir or not), he should complete his Salaat with the Imaam.\nThereafter, enquire whether the Imaam is a Musaafir or not. In the event of\nhim being a Musaafir, his Salat will be valid and complete. However, if he\nwas not a Musaafir, it is necessary for him to repeat the entire Salaat. The\nNiyyat (intention) should be general that I'm performing Asr Salaat. (Ahkame\nSafr pg.167; Deoband)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
