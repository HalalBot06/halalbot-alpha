  "question": "Do you have any contacts where we could purchace Alim books.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDo you have any contacts where we could purchace Alim books.  My friend is studying with a shaikh-ul-hadith, and has found a hard time locating books, specifically for the last year of his sudies.  He likes the large indian-style kitaabs,  with the hashia on the sides of the page.  Do you have any such places in S. africa (or anywhere esle), where we can order the kitaabs.  The madressas in the US sometimes sell the books at a high cost, and also take a long time to order.\n\nIs medical insurance halal.  My company offers medical/dental/vision coverage free of charge.  Medical costs are very high in the US-  Is it halal to use this insurance.\n\nIs home or car insurance halal?  In the US it is illegal to have no car insurance -  I have the minimum insurance.\n\nIs 401K investment halal.  My company matches up to 2% of my salary (of what I contribute)\n\nDid you ever recieve an answer from guidance financial - Is their product still questionable.\n\nMy wife serious car accident a few years ago and she was severely injured.  She has a lawsuit pending in which she\n\nstands to make a substantial amount of money.  The money would be payed by the insurance company and not by the individual.  Is that money halaal.\n\n She also had a seperate incident in which whe was given some bad blood at a hospital and this resulted in some problems.....Is it halal to sue the company and also collect that money?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1.
