  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy husband seems to think that its ok to go to a mixed gym. His excuse is that theres girls at work, shops etc, so going to a free mixed gym is fine. I told him at work he has no choice but to see women around but as for the gym, he has a choice to go to an all male gym. Who is in the wrong? Me or him? He goes to jamat regularly and even has a beard but thinks its ok to intentionally go to a place where there are women half clothed.\n\nHe made a promise to me and said that he wouldnt go inside the gym if there were any females inside so I trusted him...but recently I had a feeling that he went there at a peak time where no doubt there would be women there too. I ended up going to the gym and looked inside, he was there while there were females working out. Now he's accused me of spying, the blame got turned onto me. Am I in the wrong or is he? He doesnt seem to admit breaking a promise, in fact he tried to justify that going to a mixed gym is ok.  Now he is angry with me and is telling me that Im getting cursed, but how have I displeased him when he's the one doing wrong? Am I getting cursed? Please reply.\n\n \n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is Haraam (completely prohibited) for a male to go to a free mixed gym. That is a major sin. Your husband claims he will not enter the gym if there are no woman. That is extremely difficult. It is human nature to be attracted to the form, shape and colour of woman. It is a well known fact that a woman working out in a gym wears tight fitting garments. The inside is clearly revealed which is more attractive with the special tight fitting garments. Furthermore, the movement during a workout has its own attractive features. How could a man resist seeing a nude or semi nude woman in an attractive mode and resist?\n\nThe presence of your husband is mixed in the gym is death to his Roohaniyyat. He can never claim that he is not looking at the woman and not enjoying them. He is. Your husband should be thankful to you for coming to his rescue. He has a beard and has Deeni conscious. For sure, his act must be worrying him but his Nafs is overpowering him. Shaytaan is there to assist him in defending his act and condemning your intruits. Your husband is trapped and you need to continue assisting him before he loses all his Roohaniyyat. Don’t bother about his threats of you being cursed. He is cursed and Allah wants to remove him from His La’nat through you. You are blessed and a means for his goodness. Be firm and strong. You are doing the right thing. You have a Shar’ee obligation to save your husband from the fire of hell. That is exactly what his actions will lead him to. He will appreciate you once you succeed and he is liberated.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
