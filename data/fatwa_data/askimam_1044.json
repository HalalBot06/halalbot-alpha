  "question": "Can a Muslim wife adorn herself with lipstick, if it is worn only in front of the husband? Can other mahrams see her with Lipstick? Is the use of lipstick considered as imitating the Kufaar?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for a female to adorn herself with lipstick only for her\nhusband. The lipstick should have no impure ingredients in it and should not\nserve as a paste which prevents water from penetrating through it as that\nwill render the Wudhu invalid.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
