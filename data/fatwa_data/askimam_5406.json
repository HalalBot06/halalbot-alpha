  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease interpret the following dreams: 1) I had a dream last night in which I had a newborn child and I was carrying the baby in a baby wash basin.The baby was immersed in water, only its face exposed. However, if I walked the water began to drown the baby. I loved the child (I'm currently married without children though trying to conceive) 2) I had another dream regarding 2 teeth falling out. One was the canine and the other a molar. I recall thinking \"I promise ya Allah I promise I'll quit smoking!\" One tooth got longer as I stuck the tooth back in but my gum felt itchy. 3)My sister inshaAllah will be getting married soon. I had a dream about her future husband; He was not who we thought he would be, he treated her wrongly and they ended up apart, with her coming to live with me and my husband. Everything about it was wrong! 4) I have been having dreams with jinns going in everyone around me. I keep reciting \"aoozi billah\" and darud and the jinns never go in me-alhamdulilah, but they continue posessing my relatives. My father was the only other one uneffected (he was asleep). 5) Please prescribe for me dhikr or other such Ibaadah that will increase my Iman inshaAllah! jazakallah khair-may Allah bless you and your family.
