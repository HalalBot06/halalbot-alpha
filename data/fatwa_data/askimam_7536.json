  "answer": "QUESTION\nRecently a friend of mine had a dream after which she has become extremely worried that she may be destined to Hell. Can you please give some much needed advice. In the dream she was walking with her sister-in-law when she saw a relative who had already passed away some time ago. She decided with her sister-in-law to ask this relative about what would happen to both of them in the Akhirah, whether they would go to Hell or Heaven. The relative replied that both of them were destined for Hell. Shocked by this answer, she repeated her question on which she got the same reply. Please give some advice, as both sisters are practising and both are extremely worried and do not want to lose hope.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe information of the future given by the deceased relative has no basis whatsoever. The future is known only by Allah.\n\nYour friend should ignore the dream and strive to earn Allah?s pleasure and be successful in the hereafter. There is nothing to worry about. That is Shaytaan?s way of distracting people and making them lose hope.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
