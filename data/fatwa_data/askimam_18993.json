  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamualaikum\n\nI have asked a question about 2 weeks ago about whether it is acceptable that anyone who has minor or major decisions to make to open the Quran randomly and read the page and then see the answer in it. A lot of people do it  - I also know that if anyone starts doing it, it will soon becomes a habit and it will be hard to stop. My question is whether it is acceptable to do that whenever faced with a problem or will it be considered as shrik/innovation as the Quran was not sent for this purpose. Your answer is important as if this is Shrik then many people are sinning without knowing they are. JazakAllah\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nRandomly opening the Quran for an Ayat to make a decision in any matter is not a practice of Islam.\n\nThis has no basis in the Shari̒a and it was never practiced by Rasulullah Sallallahu ̒alayhi Wasallam, the Sahābah Radhiyallāhu ̒anhum, the Tabi ̒in, Mujathideen, Muhaditheen, Mufasireen or the Fuqahā Rahmatullāhi ̒alayhi ̒ajma̒een.\n\nIf anyone is faced with a minor or major decision in life; such as applying for a job, deciding to get married to a certain individual or migrate, then he should make Istikhārah Salāh.\n\nHazrat Jābir radhiyallāhu ̒anhu reports that Nabi Sallallāhu ̒alayhi Wasallam taught us Istikhārah in all matters like a Surah of the Quran. When one of you are faced with a matter, he should perform two Rakaats, then he should say:\n\nاللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْتَخِيرُكَ بِعِلْمِكَ وَأَسْتَقْدِرُكَ بِقُدْرَتِكَ وَأَسْأَلُكَ مِنْ فَضْلِكَ الْعَظِيمِ فَإِنَّكَ تَقْدِرُ وَلَا أَقْدِرُ وَتَعْلَمُ وَلَا أَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتَ عَلَّامُ الْغُيُوبِ اللَّهُمَّ إِنْ كُنْتَ تَعْلَمُ أَنَّ هَذَا الْأَمْرَ خَيْرٌ لِي فِي دِينِي وَمَعَاشِي وَعَاقِبَةِ أَمْرِي أَوْ قَالَ عَاجِلِ أَمْرِي وَآجِلِهِ فَاقْدُرْهُ لِي وَيَسِّرْهُ لِي ثُمَّ بَارِكْ لِي فِيهِ وَإِنْ كُنْتَ تَعْلَمُ أَنَّ هَذَا الْأَمْرَ شَرٌّ لِي فِي دِينِي وَمَعَاشِي وَعَاقِبَةِ أَمْرِي أَوْ قَالَ فِي عَاجِلِ أَمْرِي وَآجِلِهِ فَاصْرِفْهُ عَنِّي وَاصْرِفْنِي عَنْهُ وَاقْدُرْ لِي الْخَيْرَ حَيْثُ كَانَ ثُمَّ أَرْضِنِي قَالَ وَيُسَمِّي حَاجَتَهُ\n\n \n\n[1]Translation in footnote.                                                                (Sahih Bukhari pg.207 vol. 7 Dārul Fikr)\n\n \n\nInshā Allah, if this method is adopted when faced with a decision, one will be successful in that matter.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n \n\nMl. Zakariyya bin Ahmed,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDārul Iftā\n\n[1] \"Oh Allah! I seek good through your knowledge and I seek ability through your ability and I ask you for your great virtue. Verily, you are able and I am not. You know and I know not and You are the knower of the unseen. Oh Allah! If You know this matter is good for me, in my Deen, my life and in conclusion of my matter, (in bringing it quickly or delaying it) then decree it for me, make it easy and place Barakah therein for me. And if You know this matter is bad for me, in my Deen, my life and in conclusion of my matter, (in bringing it quickly or delaying it) then turn it away from me, turn me away from it and decree good for me where ever  it may be, then make me happy with it.\n\n \n\n(N.B. At the point of mentioning \"this matter\" (as underlined), think of the matter that one seeks clarity on.)"
