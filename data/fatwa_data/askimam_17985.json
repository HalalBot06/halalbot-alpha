It could refer to the Banū Hāshim, Banū Muttalib, household members of Rasulullāh (Sallallāhu alayhi wa sallam) i.e. his wives and children, pious servants of Allāh Ta’āla or the Muslims in general. The interpretation of “aal” would differ depending on the context it is used in.\n\n(Sharh Al-Zarqāni, vol 1, pg 26, Ilmiyya / Faidul Ilāhi, vol 1, pg 7, Maktaba Irshād / Sirājul Qāri, pg 4, Dar Al-Fikr)\n\n \n\n2.      Umm Al-Kulthūm, the daughter of ‘Ali (Radiyallāhu anhu) married Khalīfa ‘Umar (Radiyallāhu anhu). We do not know of any other daughter of Ali (Radiyallāhu anhu) that was married to a Khalīfa.\n\n \n\n       Ramlah, the other daughter of Ali (Radiyallahu Anh), was married to Mu'awiyah (Rahimahu Allah), who was          the son of Marwan bin Hakam.\n\n \n\nThe marriage of Umm Al-Kulthūm to ‘Umar (Radiyallāhu anhu) is a proof against Shias, who discredit Umar (Radiyallāhu anhu). They belief he was a Kāfir (wana ‘ūzubillāh). The fact ‘Ali (Radiyallāhu anhu), who they regard as their Imām, married his daughter to Umar (Radiyallāhu anhu), proves the credibility of ‘Umar (Radiyallāhu anhu).\n\n \n\n3.      Hereunder is the Hadīth:\n\nسمعت بن الزبير يقول سمعت عمر بن الخطاب يخطب يقول : سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم يخطب فقال أكرموا أصحابي ثم الذين يلونهم ثم الذين يلونهم ثم يظهر الكذب حتى يشهد الرجل ولا يستشهد ويخلف الرجل ولا يستحلف فمن أحب منكم بحبحة الجنة فليلزم الجماعة فإن الشيطان مع الواحد وهو من الإثنين أبعد ولا يخلون رجل بامرأة فإن ثالثهما الشيطان ومن سرته حسنته وسائته سيئته فهو مؤمن  (رواه النسائ) \n\n \n\n4.      To our knowledge, ‘Ali (Radiyallāhu anhu) had sons named Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. Abu Bakr was born from his wife Layla bintu Mas’ūd and ‘Umar from Ummu Habība bintu Zam’ah. (Al-Bidāya Wa al-Nihāya, vol 7, pg 314)\n\n \n\n5.      Her name was Fatima bintu Hizām, commonly referred to as ‘Ummul Banīn’. (Al-Bidāya Wa al-Nihāya, vol 7, pg 314)\n\n \n\n6.        It refers to Abu Bakr (Radiyallāhu anhu).\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
