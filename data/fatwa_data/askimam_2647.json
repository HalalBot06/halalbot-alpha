  "question": "Recently we held a lecture at our University in a hall, both brothers and sisters were invited.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nUnifortunately we had a dispute over the seating arrangement and tempers flared. The MSA wanted the sisters to be seated in a section of chairs behind the brothers since this would better prevent mixing of brothers and sisters. However another group strongly disagreed with this and even some of them said this was unislamic. The wanted the sisters to be seated in a section of chairs to the right side of the room, and the brothers in a section to the left side of the room. The MSA did not agree since this would make it to easy for the brothers to glance over at the sisters. Initially I told the brothers to sit in the front and they did so and I told the sisters to sit at the back and they also did so. But then some sisters complained and this other group told the sisters to get up and sit towards the right side and the brothers to sit towards the left side. Anyhow this resulted in big arguments anyhow the MSA president finaly said to just leave it since it was already done. Could you please tell me how the seating should have been arranged and provide proof from the Quran and sunnah and the view of the madhahib. JAzakAllah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam\n\nAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu\n\nIt is not permissible for a Ghayr Mahram (not prohibited in marriage) males\nand females to look at one another. That is clearly understood from the Qur'\naan wherein Allah Ta'ala orders males and females to lower their gazes.\n\nTherefore, the ideal situation is to have a separate programme only for the\nfemales. If that is not possible, then a female should be behind the males\nas that is understood from the incident of Hadhrat Musa (Alayhis salaam)\nwhen he was being directed to the house of Hadhrat Shu'ayb (Radhiallaahu\nAnhu) in Madyan by his daughters. Musa (Alayhis salaam) was in front and\nthe daughter of Shu'ayb was behind him.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
