  "question": "Is it permissible to use medication that contains ingredients that may be haraam?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf there is no adequate alternative for the product that contains Haraam\ningredients, and the product is prescribed by a reliable physician, it will\nbe permissible to use the product.\n\nIt is not permissible for a physician to prescribe medication having Haraam\ningredients if there is an adequate alternative. In the case of a non-Muslim\nphysician, the Muslim patient should inform the physician of the ruling of\nthe Shari'ah and request him to take cognisance of that.\n\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
