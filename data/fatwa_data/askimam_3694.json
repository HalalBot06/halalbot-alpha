  "question": "Can a man urinate while standing up, when he is not sure how clean the seat in a public toilet is?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn the western toilets, you are not sure if there may be drops of impurity sticking on the toilet seat, and even if one puts a paper cover over the seat, there is a good chance of the pants, etc, touching areas of the toilet. In a case like this is it ok to urinate standing up in public toilets?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Makrooh (disliked) in Shari'ah for a person to stand and urinate without any valid excuse. In the situation mentioned herein, it is a question of doubt that you are not sure whether the seat is clean or not. To eradicate the doubt, you may clean the toilet seat with toilet paper.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
