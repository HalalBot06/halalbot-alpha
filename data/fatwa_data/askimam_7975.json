  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf a woman wears tight pants in the privacy of her home ONLY FOR THE HUSBAND (otherwise when out in Purdah) is it allowed to pray salah wearing those pants (if they are not see through) with a burkha that covers the seat but not long enough to cover the legs. Once again this is only in the presence of the husband at home, Othewise ALLWAYS IN PURDAH-VEIL. May Allah reward you all. Thanks.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWhen a person reads Salaat, he is standing in front of Allah and is communicating directly to Allah. The main purpose of Salaat is not to merely absolve one from the obligation of Salaat, but also to gain the pleasure of Allah Ta?ala.\n\nIn order to achieve this, Salaat should be read with utmost respect and humility, i.e. by also dressing up correctly in respectable garb and staying away from tight fitting, figure showing clothes for verily, Allah Ta?ala loves shame and modesty.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
