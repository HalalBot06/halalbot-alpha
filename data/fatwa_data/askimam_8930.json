  "question": "Want to repent all sins but even wasting time is sin right? if i study and i watch tv for 15 mins and don't do study well enough isnt that also sin? Repenting is hard for me. please advice",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?The remorse in the heart (over a sin) is Tawbah.?\n\nIf you feel remorseful for your sins, that is a stepping stone for Tawbah. Nevertheless, you should continue making Tawbah as much as possible. Together with that, make a firm determination not to repeat the sin. You should never be fooled by the ploy of Shaytaan to commit any wrong and later make Tawbah. Certainly, that is not a sign of sincerity in repentance. To watch tv is a sin and not permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
