  "question": "Is it okay to accept credit card rewards?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam alaikum, Brother I was wondering if it is okay to accept rewards from Credit cards or not? e.g. some credit card companies offer point reward system e.g. air miles, which you can redeem to get free air tickets and other credit cards give similar awards to attract customers. is it permissible? plus I was also wondering if it is halal to work in a telemarketing company which is offering people credit cards. Jazak-Allah khairun\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe rewards offered by credit card companies fall in the category of Hiba\n(gifts) and serves as an incentive to credit card owners. If there are no\nimpermissible elements, e.g. gambling, etc., then to accept these rewards\nwill be permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
