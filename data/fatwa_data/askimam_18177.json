  "question": "Dua to win a match",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1.  My dad has a van he wants to sell but its not getting sold and could you please tell me dua to help it sell faster.\n\n2. My second question is that I wrestled for my school and I had lost most of my matches and I want to do it next year to so could you please tell me dua so I can win some matches.\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n1. There is no specific du’ā in sharī’ah to fulfil this need. We recommend you however to supplicate sincerely to Allāh Ta’āla and seek his assistance for the sale of the vehicle. It is with sincere supplication, trust and hope that Allāh Ta’āla fulfils the needs of his servants. The following du’ās may assist you in this regard:\n\n \n\nاللهم صل على محمد عبدك و رسولك و على المؤمنين و المؤمنات و المسلمين و المسلمات\n\n \n\nاللهم اكفني بحلالك عن حرامك وأغنني بفضلك عمن سواك\n\n \n\n2. It is interesting to observe your passion towards wrestling. Wrestling was practised by Sahaba and advocated by Rasulullāh (sallallāhu alayhi wa sallam). At the time of the battle of Uhud, Rasulullāh (sallallāhu alayhi wa sallam) requested two young Sahaba to wrestle. It is therefore commendable to wrestle. However, it is important that you do so with the correct intention (i.e. to maintain fitness and the skill of wrestling) and not to seek prominence and reputation amongst people.  If your intention is correct, Allāh Ta’āla will surely assist you in your endeavour and you could probably win your matches. However, if there are un-Islāmic activities at these matches like music, intermingling etc, it will not be permissible to participate in such competitions. \n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
