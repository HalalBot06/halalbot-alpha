  "question": "What happens with a muslim who`s soul has passed away to meet Azrain(Death Angel)? What happens then?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe angel of death extracts the soul of a person with the order of Allah Ta'\nala. If the person was a Muslim and obedient, his soul is extracted with\nease and if he was a non-Muslim or a sinful Muslim, his soul is extracted\nwith extreme pain.\n\nThe soul of an obedient Muslim is wrapped with honour by the angels\naccompanying the angel of death and his soul is taken to the heaven through\neach sky. The angels of every sky praise and welcome the soul and upon\nreaching the seventh sky, Allah Ta'ala orders the angels to place the soul\nto rest in Illiyyeen (a sacred place above). The soul of a disbelieving or\nsinful person is thrown into a sack and upon reaching the first sky, the\nangels reject him and it is ordered that his soul be dumped into the Sijjeen\n(a prison underground). May Allah Ta'ala grant our souls peace and honour\nupon our death, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT. <"
