  "question": "can i use lips stick which product will be halal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHere my freinds make fun if i not apply lips stick i am not applying lip stick b-cos i am can't find halal so i want to know the halal product\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA female may apply make up, etc. on condition; a) The ingredients are not\nHaraam, b) A female does not expose her beauty to non-Mahrams.\n\nThe ruling of using lipsticks will be the same. One must also take\ncognisance that if the lipstick becomes a base on the lips to the extent\nthat water does not penetrate through that to the actual lips, then the\nWudhu will be invalid.\n\nWe do not know where Halaal lipsticks are available in Australia.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
