  "question": "What is the translation (+ translit) for the foll. 2 Du?aas that are recited at the start of Salaat?1. Inni-Wajihatu???2. Sana Subhanak Allahumma?? questions regarding these du?aas.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nQ1. Do these have to be recited in every Rakaat when praying multiple rakaat like Taraweeh or Tahajjud? Q2. How are these supposed to be recited when one joins the Salaat when the Qiraat is already in progress or misses the first rakaat?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. (Inniy Wajjahtu Wajhiya lilladhiy fataras samaawaati wal ardh haneefan%0D%0Amuslimaa. Wamaa anaa minal mushrikeen.) I have turned my face to that being%0D%0AWho has created the heavens and earth, turning towards Him and discarding%0D%0Aall others. And I am not from the idolators.%0D%0A2. (Subhaanaka Allaahumma Wa bihamdika Watabaaraka ismuka wa ta'aalaa%0D%0Ajadduka wa laa ilaaha ghayruka). Glory be to you, O Allah, together with%0D%0AYour praise. Blessed is Your name. High is Your majesty. And there is no God%0D%0Abesides you.%0D%0A3. These Du'aas should only be recited in the first Rakaat of every set of%0D%0ARakaats. If it is a 2 Rakaat Salaat, then only in the first.%0D%0ASimilarly, if it is a 4 Rakaat Salaat, in the first. Since Taraweeh is read%0D%0Ais sets of 2, it will be read ten times in Taraweeh.%0D%0A4. If the Qiraat has commenced, then do not read these Du'aas. If one or%0D%0Amore Rakaats are missed, do not recite these Du'aas when joining. Read these%0D%0ADu'aas when standing up to complete the missed Rakaats.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Imraan Vawda%0D%0Afor: FATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
