  "question": "Meaning of Siratul Mustaqin is straight or right path. Tafsir by Imam Ibn Kathir clearly states that Sirat is a bridge over hell that everyone must pass over on the Day of Judgment. Which is right?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have understood the meaning ?Siratul Mustaqin? as straight path, right path until now. But the Tafsir by Imam Ibn Kathir clearly states that, the actual Sirat (bridge over hell that everyone must pass over) on the Day of Judgment. Is it true that every Muslim after death has to cross over the REAL BRIDGE named Siratul Mustaqin, actually in order to reach heaven? Please explain in detail.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSiraatul Mustaqeem literally means the straight path. The straight path refers to the path of obedience to Allah as shown to us by Rasulullah [Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam].\n\nIf a person follows the straight path in this world, he will cross the bridge over Jahannam easily. The bridge is described as thinner than hair and sharper than a blade with huge grippers on another side. Allah Ta?ala states, ?Verily, everyone of your will have to pass the bridge.? (Maryam 71)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
