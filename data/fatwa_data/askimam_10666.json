  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou state your daughter previously ran away. She is visiting you and you enquire if you could keep her back. What guarantee do you have that she will not run away again?\n\nYour daughter is an adult. She ran away and chose her husband by herself. Leave her to continue with her life. Offer her advice to obey Allah and follow Deen. If she follows that advise, it will help her wherever she is.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
