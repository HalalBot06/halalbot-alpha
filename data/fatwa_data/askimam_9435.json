  "question": "How I perform salat during travelling through bus, train or aeroplane from one city to another city at a distance more than 100 km.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHow I perform salat during travelling through train or aeroplane as there is difficult to find out proper direction of qibla. Also, it is difficult for one to stand for salat and manage his balance due to continuous to and fro movement one feels in the train and some times in the aeroplanes. Does one delayed his salat during travelling in train / aeroplane and wait for nearby station / airport. Is there any rule that one will return his salat which he prayed in the train / aeroplane whenever he reaches his destination? If yes, then how he will offer that salat again? Should he re-offer his already offered salat in train / aeroplane in normal way or as qaza salat?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nShari?ah has emphasised on performing Fardh Slaat on time. When you undertake a journey, you should first consider your Salaat and schedule your travelling in a way that enables you to perform Salaat out of the mode of transport. If that is not possible, then you should make arrangements to perform Salaat in the mode of transport. That is easily possible when travelling by plane or train. In doing so, ensure that you do not cause any inconvenience to the flight or programme in an aeroplane. Request the flight attendants service for performing Salaat in the plane. %0D%0A%0D%0AThe Salaat in the plane and train must be performed with the Qiyaam (standing posture) and facing the Qibla direction. In a plane, generally, there is no sudden change in direction. If that happens in the train while performing Salaat, then you should change direction accordingly. The Salaat performed in the plane or train in the standing posture while facing and maintaining the Qibla direction will be valid. The Salaat does not have to be repeated. If you are unable to perform Salaat in the bus with those two conditions, standing and Qiblah, then perform Salaat on the seat and thereafter repeat the Salaat.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
