  "question": "Selling Customer Receivables to a Bank",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nSuppose I have 1 million in Receivables which are outstanding  from various customers. The customers have agreed to pay in Installments in 2-3 yrs. Unfortunately 2-3 yrs is a long time and I need the cash immediately. I approach a Bank and the Bank agrees that it is willing to “buy” the Customer Receivables .The Bank says that it will deduct  8% on the Customer Receivables i.e  80,000$ and pay me the rest 9,20,000 $ in cash immediately. In turn I will collect 1 million which is outstanding from customers and pay it back in installments as the customer pay’s in 1-2 yrs time. Is is Halal?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalāmu `alaikum Warahmatullāhi Wabrakatuh,\n\n \n\nThe issue in reference has two different dealings\n\na)     Debtor owing you $1,000,000.\n\nb)    Loan from the Bank\n\nEffectively, The Bank is advancing you a loan of $9,200,000 at 8% interest rate. You will have to repay the Bank $1,000,000. This is a loan with interest.\n\nIt does not make a difference if The Bank terms this deal as buying the receivables outstanding. The end result is the same – A loan based on interest.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'āla Knows Best,\n\nMuftī Ebrahim Desai\n\nDaruliftaa\n35 Candella Rd, Durban, South Africa\n\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
