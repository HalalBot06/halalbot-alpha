  "question": "Hating and leaving native land.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-o-alikum, I'm here to ask ruling about migrating from a Muslim country. I live in a so-called muslim country Pakistan, where right from government to a simple man not only breaks all personal/collective laws, but also public uses religion as a stunt to perform massive killings, extreme discrimination and haterade with others on castism and materialism, monopolize mentally & psychologically, leg pulling, open dishonesty. And they do admit this proudly. No one is given full chance to prosper, no matter how much that person is honest and choses straight path of religion, in order to perform his duties, thus leaving him a psychic patient. Influence of Hindu culturalism and its deep penetration in day to day life and traditions are so powerful,it simply don't permit to practice true spirit of Islam. From the very 1st day of my maturity i've seen total lawlessness, insecurity of one's property and respect. People here are bunch of selfishness from head to toe. I know to fight against all odds but i fear this counrty won't let me lead a praised life by Allah. I've decided to leave this land. Is it permissible to hate and leave native land like this, forever?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAssalamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakatuhu\n\nThe negative factors of Pakistan are also found elsewhere albeit to a\ndifferent degree. Your criteria of staying in Pakistan or migrating should\nbe based on being able to protect and preserve your Islamic values and\nprinciples, which may be difficult in some other Muslim and Western\ncountries.\n\nAnd Allah Ta`ala Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
