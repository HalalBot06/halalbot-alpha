  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nyesterday my teacher made some mistake while checkingmy work in school. So i wrote a letter to her and pointed her mistakes.Am i justified?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThe Shariah emphasises and encourages us to acquire knowledge. To show the vast difference between those who know and those who know not, Allah Ta’ala poses the question:\n\nقل هل يستوي الذين يعلمون والذين لا يعلمون إنما يتذكر أولوا الألباب\n\n“Say: are those who know equal to those who know not? Only those of intelligence take lesson”\n\nDue to the fact that Shariah has attached so much of virtue and importance to acquiring knowledge, everything linked to knowledge will also demand a level of respect. Those deserving the most amount of respect are the teachers who have disseminated this valuable knowledge and passed to in on to us.\n\nMany a times we may have reservations for various things said or done by the teachers. If we cannot fully comprehend some action or statement of the teacher, we should not feel he or she is incorrect, rather we should take it in a good spirit. We should understand that the teacher has our best interest at heart and is trying to assist us.\n\nIf the teacher has committed an in exactitude, then there is nothing wrong in notifying the teacher of it. However it should be done in the most respectable and dignified manner. The teacher should never be disrespected or belittled in any way, shape or form.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
