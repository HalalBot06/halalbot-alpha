  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamualaikum... am ashamed of what am going to say about myself. i committed one of the biggest sin 4 years back..adultery. i repented and ask for sincere forgiveness. some time back about 6 months, i started again...My little brother came from mosque yesterday and was narrating the signification of surat nur. this touched my heart a lot and makes me want to repent again but this time for good. i won't allow shaitan to mislead me now. Please tell me what to do. how can i repent. will ALLAH forgive me now even if i asked for forgiveness before? especially during this month of ramadam? is there a special dua or salaat that I should perform? Thanks.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is very encouraging to note that you regret the wrong you have done. That itself is a stepping stone for reformation. If you are sincere about not repeating the sin, InshaAllah, you will be forgiven.\n\nIt is also important for you to stay away from all those things that will lead you to commit adultery. That includes intermingling, free talk with the opposite gender, immoral magazines and pictures. Recite the Quran excessively and be punctual with your five daily salaah. Read some Islamic literature in the beginning and end of the day.\n\nAnd Allah Ta?ala Knows Best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
