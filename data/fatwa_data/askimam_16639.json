  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n i want to ask that Can anyone else can be born with the same appearance which our nabi saw had.\n\nsecondly.pls can u give me a list of all haram actions and deeds not allowed in islam,all.?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1) It is narrated in part of a Hadith of Shamaail Tirmidhi that Ali (RadiyAllahu Anhu) said regarding Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam):\n\nلم أر قبله ولا بعده مثله\n\n\"I did not see anyone like him neither before him, nor after him\". (Shamaail Tirmidhi, P. 2, New Era Publishers)\n\nThe complete beauty of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) cannot be fully described since it was far more superior to that of all other creation. Allahmah Munaawi (Rahmatullah Alayhi) wrote that every person is required to believe that with whatever beautiful qualities and attributes the body of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) is described, no other person can be compared with similar qualities and attributes. Allah Ta'ala fully bestowed inner kamaalat (perfection) and zaahiri (apparent) beauty in Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). A'ishah (RadiyAllahu Anha) said describing the beauty of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam):\n\n\"If the friends of Zulaykha (the woman who tried to seduce Yusuf (Alayhi Salaam)) could see the blessed face of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam), they would have cut their hearts instead of their hands\".\n\nIn another Hadith it says:\n\nحدثنا هناد بن السري قال : حدثنا عبثر بن القاسم ، عن أشعث ، يعني ابن سوار ، عن أبي إسحاق ، عن جابر بن سمرة قال : « رأيت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم في ليلة إضحيان ، وعليه حلة حمراء ، فجعلت أنظر إليه وإلى القمر ، فلهو عندي أحسن من القمر »\n\n\"Jaabir (RadiyAllahu Anhu) relates: I once saw Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) on the night of a full moon. On that night he wore red clothing. At times I looked at the full moon, and at times at Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). Ultimately I came to the conclusion that Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) was more handsome, beautiful, and radiant than the full moon\". (Shamaail Tirmidhi, P. 5, New Era Publishers)\n\nBesides the abovementioned Hadiths, there are others which mention the complete beauty and elegance of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). One must remember that Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) was the best of all creation, so none other can match Him equally in both inner and outwardly appearance.\n\nRasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) has described others such as Ja'fer (RadiyAllahu Anhu) and Imam Mehdi (Alayhi Salaam) with similar qualities to those in himself, but obviously none can be equal to Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam).\n\nأشبهت خلقي و خلقي\n\nRasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) once said to Ja'fer (RadiyAllahu Anhu), \"You resemble me in both looks and personality\". (Mishkat al-Masabeeh, P. 293, Qadimi Kutub Khana)\n\nImam Mehdi (Alayhi Salaam) will also have similar features of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) will also be from the family of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam).\n\n   عن أبى سعيد الخدرى قال قال رسول الله -صلى الله عليه وسلم- « المهدى منى أجلى الجبهة أقنى الأنف يملأ الأرض قسطا وعدلا كما ملئت جورا وظلما يملك سبع سنين ».\n\n\"Abu Saeed Khudri (RadiyAllahu Anhu) says that Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said: The Mehdi will be of my family and will have a broad forehead and a prominent nose. He will fill the earth with equity and justice as it was previously filled with oppression and tyranny, and he will rule for seven years\". (Abu Dawud)\n\nThe qualities of a broad forehead and prominent nose are also used in several Hadith of Shamaail Tirmidhi to describe Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam).\n\nAnother Hadith narrated by Abdullah ibn Mas'ud (RadiyAllahu Anhu) says:\n\nيخرج رجل من أهل بيتي يواطيء اسمه اسمي وخلقه خلقي فيملؤها عدلا وقسطا كما ملئت ظلما وجورا\n\n\"A man of my household will emerge; his name will be the same as my name and his character will be like my character. He will fill the earth with justice and equity as it was previously filled with oppression and tyranny\". (Kanz al-Ummal, Vol. 14, P. 273)\n\n2) If one adheres to the commandments of Allah Ta'ala and the Sunnah of Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) while making taqleed to one of the four madhaahib of fiqh, then InshaAllah one will remain on the straight path and be successful. One should abstain from going against all of this. If you are confused or unsure about certain issues, kindly get back to us with questions regarding specific rulings and issues, as it is nearly impossible to list each and every impermissible action according to Shari'ah.\n\n And Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
