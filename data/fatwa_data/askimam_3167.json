  "question": "Does the term 'Halaka' ('Halqa', 'Halaqa') have any background?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have started going to Halaka for a month now, we sit and a shiekh talks about a verse in the quran and then explains it, but someone told me that the word Halaka is comes from a jewish background?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe word 'Halqa' means a circle, ring, also a group of students under a\nteacher.\n\nThis practice should take place from the time of the Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) right up to this date. This was always an Islamic practice and not from a Jewish practice.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
