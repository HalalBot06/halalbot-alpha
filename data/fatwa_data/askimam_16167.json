  "question": "Why do we refer to Allah as 'HE'?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nQ1. why do we refer Allah as HE, his etc since allah is uncomparable to humans.?\n\nQ2. Jannat is indeed beautiful place to live and will have infinite bounties. jannat is described in quran and hadith, all the desires and luxuries of  jannat are common like woman, food, clothes, palaces, gold and silver, stream etc but i dont see any descrition of janant to do with any modern gadgets of today such as computer games, eelctronic devices?\n\nQ3. Please give me some information about taqdeer.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful  \n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh  \n\n1. We refer to Allah Ta’ala with pronouns such as ‘He’, ‘Him’ etc because Allah Ta’ala refers to himself in the Quran with these pronouns. \n\nAllah Ta’ala mentions: “He is Allah, besides whom, none has the right to be worshipped but He”. (Sura Hashr 22)\n\n2. The bounties of Jannat are so vast that the limited minds of humans cannot fathom and comprehend. Jannat is a place consisting of every bounty, luxury and blessing a person can imagine.\n\nIf a hundred years ago, you spoke to people about technology such as motor vehicles, computers etc, they would have experienced difficulty in understanding and comprehending such items. Similarly, if you speak to people about technology to come in the next century, they will experience difficulty in understanding and comprehending that as well. The Quran and Ahadith address us according to our level of understanding. If the Ayaat and Ahadith pertaining to Jannat describe to us bounties which we have no understanding of, then we will have no idea of what to look forward for in Jannat. But, the Quran and Ahadith describe to us bounties which we have an understanding of, for example women, gold, clothing, food etc in order that we look forward to these bounties in Jannat.\n\nIn the light of the above, since during the era of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) computers etc did not exist, therefore it could not be understood by the people.   Therefore the Quran and Ahadith do not mention these items.   \n\nAllah Ta’ala mentions: “(in Jannat) there will be all that the soul’s desire”. (Zukhruf 71)\n\nTherefore, if a person desires to have anything in Jannat, it will be granted to him.\n\n3. To believe in Taqdeer is part of Imaan(faith). Taqdeer is a special knowledge known exclusively to Allah Ta’ala.Whatever took place, is taking place and will take place, was already planned and known to Allah Ta’ala, to the extent that before a child is born, Allah Ta’ala is already aware whether the child will be blessed or wretched. All good and bad that afflicts a person was already in the knowledge of Allah Ta’ala.In brief, whatever takes place in this universe was already in the plan and knowledge of Allah. (Aap Ke Masaail, vol 1,pg 174/ Mirqaat Al-Mafaateeh, vol 1, pg 145,Imdaadiyya)\n\n \n\nوالقدر بالفتح ويسكن ما يقدره الله تعالى من القضايا(مرقاة المفاتيح)\n\nوالقدر سر من أسرار الله تعالى لم يطلع عليه ملكا مقربا ولا نبيا مرسلا( مرقاة المفاتيح)\n\nقال في شرح السنة الإيمان بالقدر فرض لازم(مرقاة المفاتيح)    \n\nثم يرسل إليه الملك فينفخ فيه الروح ويؤمر بأربع كلمات : بكتب رزقه وأجله وعمله وشقي أو سعي ( رواه البخاري ومسلم)\n\n فأخبرني عن الإيمان قال أن تؤمن بالله وملائكته وكتبه ورسله واليوم الآخر وتؤمن بالقدر خيره وشره(رواه مسلم\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
