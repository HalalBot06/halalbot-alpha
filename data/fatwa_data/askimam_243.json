  "question": "According to the Hanafi Madhhab, is it allowed for an Alim to charge a fee to teach the Holy Qur'an or for giving an Islamic lecture. The same applies to the Huffaz in Ramadan.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDuring the time of our pious predecessors, the Baytul Maal (Islamic\ntreasury) used to fulfil the needs of those engaged in imparting Deeni\nknowledge. In the absence of the Baytul Maal, the needs of such people would\nnot be fulfilled, the learned people will be compelled to earn their living\nby other means, working, business, etc. resulting in Deeni knowledge being\nneglected.\n\nTherefore, circumstantially, the latter jurists in view of the importance of\npropagating Deen have permitted taking Ujrah governed by the principle of\n'necessity relaxes prohibition'.\n\nIf the Haafidh is not employed by any organization, he cannot receive\nremuneration only for reciting the Qur'aan in Taraweeh.\n\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
