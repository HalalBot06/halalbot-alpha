  "question": "You're saying beard is waajeeb.But in shaafee madhhab there is no huqum as waajeeb.? So it must either be fardh or sunnah. What can you say about this?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nNobody can say beard is fardh. So if it is sunnah in shaafee madhhab, since it is also haq madhhab a shaafee person can be imaam in salah.Secondly; In the Holly Qur;an Allah cc. declers \" la yukalellifullahu nefsen illa wus'aha.\" but black people cant grow beard.So what about haneefi blacks? Are they sinful or hasha (Allah forbid)a thousand times Allah is wrong in the above ayet? For Allah ordered human being to grow beird but didnt give the ability to grow it? l definitly demand answer for this question\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn the case where a Hanafi wishes to perform Salaat behind a Shaafi?ee, Maaliki or Hanbali Imaam, Allaamah Shaami [ra] states that it is a condition that the Salaat of the Imaam must not be considered invalid or improper according to the Hanafi Madhab. If the Hanafi follower is aware of an act that the Imaam has done which effectively renders the Salaat incorrect in the Hanafi Madhab, then the Salaat of that Hanafi behind that Imaam will not be proper. (Shaami)%0D%0A%0D%0ANote: This is the ruling of the Hanafi Madhab which is directed to that follower of the Hanafi Madhab. Obviously, the Shaafi?ee, Maaliki, Hanbali Imaam will not be affected by this as he would follow the ruling of his Madhab.%0D%0A%0D%0AAlso take note that we have stated time and again that we are unable to pass any verdict on the Shaafi?ee, Maaliki or Hanbali Madhab. Competent Ulama should be consulted for the preferred view of each Madhab.%0D%0A%0D%0AAs for the flimsy objection concerning that person whose beard naturally does not grow, I?m sure you accept that to wash the arms upto and including the elbows is Fardh in Wudhu. What would be your response to that person who doesn?t have a hand or even both hands? Would you make the same blasphemous statement regarding such a situation, i.e. that Allah ordered him to wash his arms, but didn?t give him the ability to do so? Your response to this would answer your original concern.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abassommar%0D%0AFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH SCIENCES%0D%0A%0D%0Achecked & approved by: MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI (FATWA DEPT.)"
