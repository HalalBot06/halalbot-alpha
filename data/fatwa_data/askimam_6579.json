  "question": "I got married to an American Muslim (new) in an American court by an official without any witnesses. Is this marriage islamically legal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe Nikah is not valid.\n\nA Nikah is performed with a proposal (Iejaab) by the male or female and\nacceptance (Qubool) by the male or female in the past tense and in the\npresence of two male Muslim witnesses (Hidaaya vol. 2).\n\nIt is Sunnat that the marriage be announced and performed in the Masjid and\nthe bride be represented by her Mahram (father, brother, etc.). The bride\ngives consent to her representative (Wakeel) in the presence of two\nwitnesses to perform her marriage at the Masjid. At the Masjid, the Wakeel\nrepresents the bride in the presence of the two witnesses and the stipulated\ndowry. The witnesses must be two trustworthy and pious male Muslims who are\nnot her ascendants e.g. father, grandfather or decendants e.g. son,\ngrandson, etc.\n\nThe Mahr (dowry) is the woman's right and should be stipulated prior to the\nmarriage.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
