  "question": "Can women use the coil for medical reasons?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni understand that women are not allowed to use a coil as a form of contraceptive. My question is that are women allowed to use the coil for medical reasons, such as heavy bleeding. I was recently diagnosed as being aneamic and for this reason my gynaecologist has suggested a new type of coil, for the heavy bleeding. Am i allowed to use the coil for this reason.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n If this is the only adequate treatment as suggested by your gynaecologist then you may use the coil.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n  \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
