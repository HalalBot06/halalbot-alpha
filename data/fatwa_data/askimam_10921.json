May Allah grant you and your%0D%0Afamily afiyah. Ameen%0D%0A%0D%0AAt the outset, you should understand that this world is a world of cause%0D%0Aand effect. Allah has created us and wishes good for everyone. For the%0D%0Avery reason He has granted us the gift of Imaan. %0D%0A%0D%0AWe belive that Allah has written our Taqdeer (faith) and what He has%0D%0Adestined for us is in fact best for us. Allah says in the Quraan%0D%0A\"perhaps you may like something but that in fact is bad for you, and%0D%0Aperhaps you dislike something but that is better for you. %0D%0A%0D%0AWe understand the difficulty you are undergoing. We as Muslims believe%0D%0Ain Allah and His power and might. Exercise patience for Allah is with%0D%0Athe patient ones. Continue making dua and a suitable partner will come%0D%0Aat the correct time. Recite Ayah Number 29 of Surah 23 after every%0D%0ASalaah.%0D%0A%0D%0ASecondly, Allah is our Sole Provider. He created different avenues in%0D%0Aorder for us to get our sustenance. If one avenue is closed, certainly%0D%0Aanother is opened. The vice chancellor is also the creation of Allah and%0D%0Aalso depends on the sustenance provided by him. Rather turn your gaze to%0D%0Athe source of every ones sustenance that is Allah. Turn to Allah and%0D%0Asupplicate your difficulty to him. Surely Allah answers the prayer of%0D%0Athose who are in difficulty. It is essential to note that you should%0D%0Aadvise your family to become more Deeni conscience. That is they should%0D%0Aincrease in their Salaah, Zikr and recitation of the Quraan. These are%0D%0Athe means to invoke the mercy and pleasure of Allah whereby He shall%0D%0Ashower you with his blessings and bounties.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn conclusion, you should not consider the bad to be effects of black%0D%0Amagic. We suggest you put that ideology aside and concentrate on the way%0D%0Aforward to improve your life. Become focussed on your future rather than%0D%0Abeing bogged down in issues of the past. Allah has given you great%0D%0Astrength and courage, use it to go forward and progress. Approach life%0D%0Apositively as this will assist you in reviving your sprits. Make it a%0D%0Amust to wake up for Tahajud Salaah and cry to Allah your needs.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
