  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy question is regarding the method of Ba-jamaat namaz:\n\nIf someone is offering the ba-jamaat namaz should he be required to recite the \"Surah-fatiha\" and \"surah after that\" ; if imam of masjid is reciting it ?\nNow in case of Zuhr and Asr prayers (when imam is not reciting loudly the Surah fatiha and Surah) should people have to recite it or they simply should stand quiet ?\nIn the last 02 rakats of farz namaaz i know that surahs are not recited after surah fatiha, just want to confirm this from you ?\nif i join the namaz ba jamaat in the rukooh of first rakaat, i don't need to repeat the 1st rakaat (this is what i understand); now when will i recite the SANA \"subhanakaALLAH ....\" ?\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n \n\n1.       According to the Hanafi mazhab, when performing salah with jamaat, the followers (muqtadi) will not recite sura Fatiha or a sura in any rakat in the standing posture (Qiyam). If he joins the Imam in the beginning of the salah, then the muqtadi will say the takbir-e-tahrima (Allahu Akbar) and recite the Thana only. The same ruling will apply for those salah in which the Imam makes audible qiraat (Qiraat Jehri) like Fajr Salah. Maghrib and Esha or in those salah in which soft qiraat in made like Zohar and Asr salah.\n\n2.       In the last two rakats behind the Imam, the muqtadi will not recite anything, not sura Fatiha or any other sura.\n\n3.       If the muqtadi joined the Imam in ruku, then the muqtadi got the rakat. He does not have to repeat that rakaat.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\n\nWassalam\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
