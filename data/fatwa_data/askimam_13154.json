  "question": "1: Is it allowed for a male to get his hair thinned in order to reduce the thickness of the hair?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n2: Is giving the Kafara to a person who is eligible for zakaat allowed? 3: Will the Salaah be accepted if one has to pray it at work in a room where there are photos of people, and they cannot be covered? 4: What is the difference between Lillah and Sadqa? 5: Is there a time period within which the sajda e sahwa has to be done? Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. For what reason is this done.\n2. Kaffaarah may be given to those eligible to receive Zakaat.\n3. The Salaat will be valid. However, all attempts should be made to perform the Salaat where there are no uncovered pictures.\n4. ?Lillah? refers to any optional form of charity. ?Sadaqah? generally refers to Waajib (compulsory) forms of charity.\n5. Sajda Sahw should be made after reciting Tashahhud. If it is delayed, it will still be valid. It will be valid any time before one does anything that breaks Salaat, e.g. before talking or turning away from the Qiblah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMl. Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT."
