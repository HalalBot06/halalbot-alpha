Jazakallahu Khairun\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nA man and woman (husband and wife or Mahrams) may recite their Salaat\nindividually in one room.\n\nThere is no restriction with regards to the distance between them as long as\nthey are not reciting the same Salaat, i.e. they are reading their own\nSalaat and not following each other.
