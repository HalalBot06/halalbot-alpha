  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have heard that it is right to where leather socks and then its no need to wash the legs .Is this right.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is permissible to make Masah (wipe) on leather socks as a substitute of\nwashing the feet on condition one makes complete Wudhu before putting on the\nleather socks.\n\nA non-traveller may make Masah for one day and night and a Musaafir may make\nMasah for three days and nights. The time will be calculated upon the Wudhu\nbreaking after having put on the leather socks.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
