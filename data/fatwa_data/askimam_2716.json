  "question": "Could America be Dajjal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI actually personally wonder about Dajjal. Considering the events that are taking place in the world such as the absolute power of the US, support of and for the Jews, the droughts and sanctions against those who do not submit, like in Afghanistan, makes me wonder whether perhaps America can be the Dajjal? I realize that Dajjal is supposed to have one eye and be a man supported by the Jews, yet the similarities strike me. Plz comment.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDajjaal will be a physical person. Hence, America cannot be the Dajjaal\nforetold in the Ahaadith.\n\nDajjaal will have many followers, who would have prepared the ground for\nhim. It appears that America is one of the forerunners of Dajjaal.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
