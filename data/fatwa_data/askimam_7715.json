  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIslam is indeed the true religion. It was and is the only religion accepted by Allah. There are two aspects of Islam, a) Fundamental beliefs, b) Practices.\n\nThe fundamental beliefs of Islam, belief in the Oneness of Allah, His Greatness, life after death, etc. were always the same. However, the practices (Shari?ah) differed from time to time. Hence, the Shari?ah of Musa (Moses) was different from Eesa (Jesus) and Mohammed.\n\nThe final Prophet of Islam is Muhammed and now the Shari?ah is stipulated forever. In order for us to assist you, kindly advise what is your confusion and we shall try to alleviate that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
