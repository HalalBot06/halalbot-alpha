  "answer": "QUESTION\n87.48 gms Gold and 612.36 gms Silver, converts to about 2.8125 Oz Gold and 19.6875 Oz Silver. The Gold converts to about $775 USD and the Silver $91 USD. There is a huge disparity between the Gold and Silver Nisaab, so which should be used for calculating our own Zakaat and which should be used for calculating whether a person is a worthy recipient.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person has gold, the value of the gold will be taken into\nconsideration. If he has silver, the value of silver will be taken into\nconsideration. If he has cash, then the calculation should be inthe\nobligation and dispensation according to the interest of the poor and needy.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
