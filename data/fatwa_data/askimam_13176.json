  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am making up my qada salat. i have already made up many of my qada salat already. But i wanted to know whether the intention that i had was correct for the qada salar made up.  For instance if i was making up qada of fajar i would intend that this is the \"first\" fajar salat qada and i would make the exact same niyyat for the following qadas of fajar. i have done this so far for all the qada salats i have made up so far. also somethimes i would just intend that this is qada of salah \"x\" and thats it. is this correct?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nYour intention of ‘first Salat’ in fulfilling your Qadhaa Salaats is correct.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
