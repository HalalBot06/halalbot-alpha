  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy wife who al hamidullah is a convert from hinduism has a question. Her mother who is still hindu has a life insurance policy for a big amount. Now she never asked my wife to pay or take part in this life insurance payments etc. She herself  ( the hindu mother)has put my wife on this life insurance policy to recieve money of the certain amount when she dies. Is my wife able to take this share from the life insurance .. or does she have to forfiet the money or give it away because it is haraam money. Jazak allah for your time May Allah reward for all you efforts .. Amin.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe money received from the life insurance policy of your non Muslim mother in law will be regarded as hiba (gift). Therefore, it is permissible for your wife to accept the money from her mother’s life insurance payout after her death.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMuhammed Zakariyya Desai"
