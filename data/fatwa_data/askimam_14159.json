  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have problem of maintaining my Wuddu (Purity). When ever I establish wuddu for a prayer I have fear of loosing it and most of the time I do loose it. I re-establish my wuddu for the prayer and some times I have to do it two three times. Even during performing prayer I do loose or I have doubts that I have loose my Wuddu. It gives me very bad feelings and espiacally when I am praying with Jamaat. what should I do to overcome this problem. (I loose my wuddu due to discharge of gass). Please help me. Also kindly tell me what is condition, when one loose his wuddu while performing prayer with the Jamaat, shall he immediate leave the prayer and go to re-establish his wuddu, But in case if he is standing in the 1st or 2nd row then how should he cross the other rows to go out and re-establish his Wuddu.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. A person has a problem maintaining his Wudhu and the problem is so severe that he cannot read his Fardh Salaat without his Wudhu breaking, such a person will be regarded as a Ma’zoor in the Shari’ah. A person in this situation is only obliged to make Wudhu once for the Salaat after the time of that particular Salaat sets in. He will read his Salaat during that time regardless of the fact whether he passes gas or not his Wudhu will remain intact. The only time his Wudhu will break is when the time for that Salaat expires and the time of the next Salaat sets in or some other factor besides passing wind occurs which breaks the Wudhu. For example, he passes urine or stool or he bleeds from a cut or wound. The person will remain a Ma’zoor as long as the problem of him suffering from uncontrollable gas persists. If he does not experience this problem at all during the entire time of one Salaat, for example, from the time Asr sets in till sunset, he did not experience the problem of uncontrollable gas at all, he will come out from the law of a Ma’zoor and the general rules of Wudhu will apply to him once again. That is if he passes wind or any other factor occurs which invalidates the Wudhu, he will have to renew his Wudhu. (Raddul Muhtaar vol.1 pg.305)\n\n2. If a person’s Wudhu breaks during Salaat, he should leave the congregation in the following manner: a) If he finds a gap to pass through easily, he should pass through, b) If he cannot find a way to pass through easily, he should walk across the row and leave the congregation. He will not be sinful for passing in front of those engaged in Salaat. (Ahsanul Fataawa vol.3)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
