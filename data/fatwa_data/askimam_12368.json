  "answer": "QUESTION\nI recently got proposed, and 2 days after,my parents found out that my fiance has done many wrong things in the past. He denies all of it but i have spoken to a friend of his and he advised me not marry him. What do i do? My istikarah was positive and my parents were very happy when they first met him, but now they want me to break off the proposal. Is there any dua/namaaz that i can read to be sure of whether he is telling me the truth or are people just jealous of us, that they are making up stories!Should i listen to my parents, or still go on with the wedding?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is difficult for us to advise you as you did not state the types of wrong attributed to him. Nevertheless, no human being is free of wrongs. If things you heard about the person are serious and could impact on your marriage, then you should exercise precaution.\n\nInstead of breaking the proposal, request your parents to get clarity on the issues before deciding.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
