  "question": "I missed Jumuah Salaah because of a meeting",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI had a meeting setup with a staff member to discuss performance over the last year. This meeting was scheduled to end at 12:00pm but as there were problems that came out during the discussion, the meeting ended at 13:30. I thus missed my Jummah salaah because of this. I have an empty feeling inside of me as this is the first time in my life something like this happened. Pls let me know the severity of my haraam action here and what effect it will have on me being a Muslim. I have heard and learnt at madressa that missing Jummah can take you out of the fold of Islam. Does this apply to me?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nJumu’ah Salaah is an obligation of Deen. It is not permissible for any Muslim to leave out Jumu’ah intentionally. There are severe warnings mentioned against those who leave out Jumu’ah Salaah intentionally.\n\nعن جابر بن عبد الله قال خطبنا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال «... أن الله قد افترض عليكم الجمعة فى مقامى هذا فى يومى هذا فى شهرى هذا من عامى هذا إلى يوم القيامة فمن تركها فى حياتى أو بعدى وله إمام عادل أو جائر استخفافا بها أو جحودا بها فلا جمع الله له شمله ولا بارك له فى أمره ألا ولا صلاة له ولا زكاة له ولا حج له ولا صوم له ولا بر له حتى يتوب فمن تاب تاب الله عليه... ».\n\nIt has been mentioned on the authority of Jaabir (Radhiyallahu Anhu) that Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) said, “…Verily Allah Ta’ala has made Jumu’ah obligatory upon you on this very day, in this month of this year, till the day of Qiyamah. The one who leaves out this Salaah during my lifetime or after I have left this world, whether he has a just or unjust ruler, taking this commandment lightly or not accepting the commandment, Allah will create disunity in him, he will have misfortune in all his doings. No Salaah of his will be accepted, no Zakaat of his will be accepted, no Haj of his will be accepted, no fasting of his will be accepted and no good deed of his will be accepted until he repents. Allah Ta’ala forgives the one who seeks for forgiveness…”.\n\n(Sunan Ibn Majah Pg.75 – Qadeemi Kutub Khana)\n\nعن أبى الجعد الضمرى وكانت له صحبة عن النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم قال « من ترك ثلاث جمع تهاونا بها طبع الله على قلبه ».\n\nIt has been reported on the authority of Abul Ja’ad Al Dhumari (Radhiyallahu Anhu) that Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) said, “Allah Ta’ala seals the heart of that person who misses out three Jumu’ahs due to negligence.\n\n(Sunan Al Nasai Vol.1 Pg.202 - Qadeemi Kutub Khana)\n\nThere is no doubt that it is a grave sin to leave out Jumu’ah intentionally and you should have great remorse for what has happened. However, you should seek forgiveness from Allah Ta’ala and make a firm intention to not let it happen again. Even if you are engaged in a meeting with non-Muslims, you could ask them to excuse you. This will increase the respect in their heart for Muslims, as they will understand the importance Muslims give to their Deeni obligations.\n\nYou should make this a reason to increase your good deeds, repent to Allah Ta’ala sincerely for whatever wrong that has been done and gain closeness to Allah Ta’ala. Allah is All Forgiving and All Merciful, and there is no doubt that Allah Ta’ala will forgive all your sins when you ask for forgiveness with sincerity and remorse. Allah Ta’ala mentions in the Holy Quran:  \n\nقل يا عبادي الذين أسرفوا على أنفسهم لا تقنطوا من رحمة الله إن الله يغفر الذنوب جميعا إنه هو الغفور الرحيم\n\nSay (on My behalf), ―O servants of Mine who have acted recklessly against their own selves, do not despair of Allah‘s mercy. Surely, Allah will forgive all sins. Surely, He is the One who is the Most-Forgiving, the Very-Merciful.\n\n(Verse: 39:53)\n\nMoreover, you should not make it a reason for you to become despondent, as being despondent is from the habit of the non-believers. Allah Ta’ala says in the Holy Quran:\n\nولا تيئسوا من روح الله إنه لا ييئس من روح الله إلا القوم الكافرون\n\nAnd do not lose hope in the mercy of Allah. In fact, only the infidels lose hope in Allah‘s mercy.\n\n(Verse: 12:87)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
