  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. I know it is not permissible to go to haram parties like weddings, birthdays and anniversary parties and halal parties like valimas (where there are cameras). But is it O.K. to go to the haram parties and halal parties (avoiding cameras) if your parents or husband make you go and also if you?re afraid that not going would result in breaking ties with relatives? 2. In these parties the men and women are separate but sometimes a few men come in or pass through to take food, etc, so is it O.K. to go if you?re going to be wearing niqab all the time, because if you don?t go then relatives will be insulted. 3. If you can?t go to these parties, should you tell the real reason for not coming? 4. What can a woman show to her marriage suitor? I mean can she show only her hair too? 5. Can you leave a recording on answering machines saying assalamualaikum we are not available? Because the person calling your house can be a non-Muslim too and this way he will receive the salam. Is it ok? 6. Should women cover their head when azaan is going on? And also keep quiet? 7. Is it makruh to call your husband by his name? Because right now this is common and is not considered disrespect? 8. I know playing cards is wrong but what about board games in which dice is used? Please answer by the numbers.
