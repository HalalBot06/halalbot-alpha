  "question": "Out of anger I pronounced the 3xtalaaqs to her without any witnesses being present,and no papers were signed.Is this Talaaq legal and binding? A day or later I had intercourse with my wife.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaam u Alaikum Mufti,Kaifa-anta. I had marital problems 2 yrs ago whereby I issued my wife with the first talaaq.We got back together during her Iddah and everything went well for 1 year.Then things turned sour where my wife threw me out of the house because of me speaking to female colleagues.She kept harrassing and pressurizing me to give the talaaq.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe three Talaaqs annonced by you are legal and binding. She is no longer\nyour wife. It is Haraam to live with her.\n\nFear Allah Ta'ala and face up to this reality. Know very well that no matter\nwhat we do, life in this world is very short. We will have to stand\ntomorrow before Allah Ta'ala. There is no escape from the Aakhirat.\nTherefore, be brave and accept the consequences of your own actions.\n\nMay Allah Ta'ala grant you courage.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
