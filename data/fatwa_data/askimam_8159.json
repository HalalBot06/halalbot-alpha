  "answer": "QUESTION\ndoes watching tv break ur wudu? if a piece of skin peels off ur body does this break ur wudu as well?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is not permissible to watch TV, however, that does not invalidate the Wudhu. It is Mustahabb to re-perform Wudhu after committing a sin.\n\n2. No, skin peeling off does not break your Wudhu so long as no blood, etc. flows out. (Bahishti Zewar vol.1)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
