  "question": "Can Muslims answer the telephone with \"Asalamualaikum\"?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nBearing in mind that we dont know if a non Muslim is on the other end? If Muslims cant answer the telephone with \"Asalamualaikum\", than how should a Muslim answer a telephone? a telephone at ones home for example\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSalaam is invoking peace on another person.\n\nSaying Assalaamu Alaykum to a non-Muslim is incorrect. Therefore, if one is unsure who the caller is, he/she should not answer the telephone with these words, but rather some other method should be adopted.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
