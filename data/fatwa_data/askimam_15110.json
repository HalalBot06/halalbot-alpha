It is always wise to engage them in the process and make them part of the decision. The wisdom behind this is that they will not point a finger to you in the future should anything to the marriage (Allah forbid). Your parents may then talk to the girls parents and arrange for marriage.\n\nIf your parents are not in favour of the girl, you should give due consideration to their opinion. They have experience and wisdom and only wish good for you. Perhaps they perceive that this partner is not suited for your lifestyle. Therefore, you should also make Istikhara and seek Allah’s guidance on the matter. Do not rush with the matter as you would only regret in the future. You rather play safe and delay the marriage for a few weeks than rush and bear the burden for the rest of your life.\n\nAnd Allah knows best \n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
