  "answer": "QUESTION\nWell basically I have been having dreams for the past couple of years with spiders constantly being present in my house. Sometimes they are flying and come straight at me and subsequently I wake up, sometimes they are present and crawling around in different corners of my house and recently I have had a dream where I one came out of my mouth. I do have a general phobia of spiders and the dreams are really making me uneasy. Please can you advise me as to whether they have a significance. Jazakallah khair.

Ameen\n\nWe are responsible for those things which are within our control. You should request your old friends to discard or give you the old photos. You should explain to them that you are now in Hijaab and it is not appropriate for them to have the photographs.\n\nIt is permissible to use Nivea cr√®me.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
