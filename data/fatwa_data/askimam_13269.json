  "question": "Husband having an affair",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy husband is having an affair, I have only been married 1 yr & I dont want to end in divorce. He spends all his time & money on her. I have a baby too. Can you please tell me what I can read to make him intersted in me & my daughter.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThere are two aspects to this query\n\nA) Your husband B) Dua\n\nIt is important to analyse the reason why your husband has taken a second wife so soon after your marriage. It is natural every person loves to be where he/she is loved. Generally, the first year of marriage is the foundation of this bond. If the bond is cemented with love, understanding, tolerance and trust, this marriage bond will be solid and unbreakable even in stormy weather. Therefore, you should first try and open up the communication link between you and your husband. You should conduct yourself in a manner that he regains confidence in you and his love and want for you is rekindled. Afford him all the respect he deserves and he in turn will honour you and respect you. Once you win his confidance then the sky will be limit for his love for you and your child.\n\nApart from Duas and wazifas, it is more important that you handle this issue practically. If you make loads of dua and not show him any love and respect, the dua may not prove that effective. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] said \"You will be treated by people as you treat them\".\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMl.
