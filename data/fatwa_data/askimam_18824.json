  "answer": "QUESTION\nI had an argument with my wife and next day while I was taking bath, the previous day’s argument scene came into my mind. I got extremely angry and was highly upset too. While the scene of yesterday’s incident was running in my mind, I told my self that this is what i should have done yesterday or I should do in future if similar things happen again. Then I am imagining my wife and me getting up, hitting her on face and saying talak 3 times. Now, this is all happening in thoughts but I did utter the words talak 3 times. When I say I uttered, I mean my lips moved. It was more like murmering and I myself did not heard it clearly. I was in the bath with running tap and my voice (if there was any) was so low that I am sure that someone standing next to me would not have heard it or in extreme case, could have heard some voice but won’t understand what I actually spoke. Again, this was all me imagining the previous incident and with thoughts that this is what i should have done yesterday or i should do. I did not had any intention of ‘actually giving’ talak. Now, could you please clarify me if the talak has actually happened? Please help me get out of this misery.
