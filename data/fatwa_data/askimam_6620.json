To develop concentration in Salaat, one should keep one's gaze at the%0D%0Aplace of Sajdah whilst in the standing position, between the feet whilst in%0D%0ARuku, on one's nose whilst in Sajdah and on the thighs while in the%0D%0ATashahhud position.%0D%0A2. The key is protection of one's gaze. Firstly, keep in mind the rewards of%0D%0Alowering one's gaze especially when you have the desire to look, remember at%0D%0Athat specific time if you lower your gaze, Allah Ta'ala will grant you the%0D%0Asweetness of Imaan. Secondly, never ever leave your mind idle. Always occupy%0D%0Ayourself with something constructive.%0D%0A3. Yes, it is true that we should not befriend non-Muslims but this is%0D%0Abecause of the fear of their plots and influence. If, however, our%0D%0Aintentions are pure and we befriend them with the intention of getting them%0D%0Acloser to Islam, then it will be permissible.%0D%0A4. Most definitely, to wear the Imaamah is a great Sunnah of our beloved%0D%0ANabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A5. You can recite the three Quls before sleeping and constantly recite Ta'%0D%0Aawwuz (Ao'odhu billaahi minas shaytaanir rajeem)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
