  "answer": "QUESTION\nI reverted to Islam in April this year. Prior to this I had been married to a non muslim but this marriage broke down several months before my reversion. I am currently getting a legal divorce through the UK courts. My question is do I observe Iddah for this unislamic marriage and if so when from? The date of speration (before reversion), the date I reverted or from when I get my legal divorce? May Allah reward you for your good work.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, it is not necessary for revert to Islam to observe the Iddah\nperiod.
