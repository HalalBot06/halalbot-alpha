  "question": "Is there a dua or something I can read so Allah will make it easy for me, please read details.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am not very good looking person. When sitting in bayaans or even going to masjid people always stare at me which is not very nice. This puts me off and I don?t tend to sit in bayaans or taleem anymore which really is my loss. So is there anything I can read or dua that Allah will make it easy for me to participate in ijtamaiy amaals.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nFirst and foremost, try and repel the idea that people are staring at you.\nThis could also be psychological. Even if you are sure people are staring at\nyou, ignore them and continue with your life. It is not your external beauty\nthat counts, it is what is within you and what you make of yourself.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
