  "question": "Nephew makes me angry when reading Quran and Salaah",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a nephew who is about 4 years old. Whenever I read the Holy Quran or pray my Salah he likes to disturb me by jumping or putting his feet up or standing in front of me when I pray. I try to explain to him that this is not respect for the Quran and to stand infront of me in prayer is also not correct. but he is very naughty. This makes me angry. But more importantly, does this or will this affect his iman when he grows older? How should I correct him? Should I punish him or rebuke him angrily or should I have patience and speak to him gently?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is natural for children to behave in that manner. Therefore there is no harm if they conduct themselves in that way. As they grow up they would realize the status of Quraan and accordingly show respect. Their current actions do not harm their Imaan. You should continue advising them with regards to the status of the Quraan and the importance of showing respect to it. Speaking politely is a more effective way of advice than beating. Furthermore, if you beat them it might create hatred in their hearts for the Quraan as they would recall that they were beaten because of the Quraan.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Emraan Vawda\nDarul Iftaa"
