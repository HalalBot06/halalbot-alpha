  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Mufti Sahab, As-Salaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullahui Wa Barakatuhu. Salaam to all respected Mufti Sahab?s in Darul Ifta and especially to Hadh?rat Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Hafidh Allah). Hadh?rat my marriage has been arranged this year in May, Insha Allah. Please pray for it success and supplicate to Allah (Subhanahu Ta?ala) to give me and my family members courage to adhere to Sunnah of our beloved Prophet Muhammad (SallalLahu`alayhi wasallam) and may He prevent us from any un-Islamic rituals and innovations. Hadh?rat I would humbly request you to draft me an invitation which might be Dawa?h of Deen as well as for Nikah. Jazak Allah. Was Salaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAlhamdulillah, it is indeed a very joyous and happy occasion for you. We%0D%0Amake Du'aa that Allah Ta'ala grant love, understanding and Barkaat in your%0D%0Amarriage.%0D%0A%0D%0AMarriage is a great Sunnat of our beloved Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam). In a Hadith, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'Nikah is%0D%0Afrom my Sunnah.' And in another Hadith, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam)%0D%0Ahas said, 'Verily the best of Nikahs in blessings is the Nikah that has the%0D%0Aleast expenses.' (Mishkaat pg.268)%0D%0A%0D%0AWe advise that you make an earnest effort to make your Nikah as closest as%0D%0Apossible in accordance to the Sunnah and free it from all types of rituals%0D%0Aand customs. This will, in turn, create countless blessings in your%0D%0Amarriage. The aspect of making up special wedding cards and invitations has%0D%0Ano basis in Shari'ah. Da'wat could be given in a more informal and simple%0D%0Amanner, either verbally, telephonically or by means of a simple letter.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
