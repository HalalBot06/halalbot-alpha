  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs there any basis from the Quran & Sunnah to recite the last verse of Surah Nuun to protect oneself from the evil eye? Also is there any basis for one who intends to marry to recite Surah Dahr daily?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh  \n\nThe recitation of the last verses of sura Nun as a means of protection from evil eye and the recitation of sura Dahr for marriage is based on people’s experience. It is possible someone has found the recitation of these verses and suras effective for a particular need and passed over their experiences to others. There is nothing wrong in following the experiences of others as long as one does not regard those experiences as compulsory in Shariah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai \n\nDarul Iftaa"
