  "question": "Can I marry for a second time without my father's consent?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI met a man on the internet and I want to marry him before he comes out here to meet me. This will be my 2nd marriage and I have had very strong signs from Allah about this guy. Would my marriage be valid if I married him over the phone without my parents knowledge and then when he comes out here, we will then get my parents blessings?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe strong signs in reference could very well be motivated by your feelings\nand emotions. Marriage is a major step in life. You should exercise extreme\nprecaution in choosing your partner by making Istikhaara (seek divine\nguidance) and Mashwarah (consult) with your senior elders.\n\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'To hasten is an act of the\nShaytaan.' In the speed and spirit of the moment, you may commit a gave\nerror only to realise later.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
