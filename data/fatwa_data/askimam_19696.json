  "answer": "QUESTION\nMalfooz 26: The request of bay’ah from woman and Malfooz 27: It is difficult to be a Pīr\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nMalfooz 26: The request of bay’ah from woman\n\n \n\nHazrat mentioned that he received a letter from a woman saying that she wishes to get bay’ah and she attached the consent of her husband. So I told her that if she wants to become bay’ah, she must read and implement the masāil of Bahishti Zewar and Qasdus Sabeel.\n\n \n\nMalfooz 27: It is difficult to be a Pīr\n\n \n\nJust as it is difficult to rule a kingdom, it is difficult to be a Pīr; some people are happy with you, others are angry so to what extent can one keep everyone happy?\n\n              \n\nComments by Mufti Ebrahim Desai sahib:\n\n People in this day and age take bay’ah at the hands of a pious person for all the wrong reasons. The reason for bay’ah is to make Islah.\n\n \n\nHazrat Mufti Mahmūdul Hasan Gangohi sahib rahmatullahi alaihi mentions in his malfoozaat that in his era, there were great, influential Akābirīn such as Moulana Husain Ahmad Madni Sahib rahmatullahi alaihi, but he decided to get bay’ah to the youngest; Hazrat SheikhMaulana Zakariyyah sahib rahmatullahi alaihi. He gave two reasons for this.\n\n \n\n1) He mentions that when he would sit in the majaalis of the other pious Ulama, he could feel the effect, but when he would sit in the majaalis of Hazrat Sheikh rahmatullahi alaihi, he was directed towards his weaknesses.\n\n \n\n2) Because Hazrat Sheikh was the youngest, he would be able to make his Islah for the longest period of time."
