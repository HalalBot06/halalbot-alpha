  "answer": "QUESTION\nthe Prophet Sallalahu Alaihi Wassalaam used to do it 10 times in the morning and night. What does this mean and what is the best way to do Astaghfar/Istighfaar. Jazakallah Khairan\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIstighfaar means seeking forgiveness of one's sins. The best way to do this\nis that together with abundant recitation of Istighfaar (according to one's\nability), we should bring obedience of Allah and the way of Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) into our lives as these bring tremendous\nforgiveness for sins as explained in many Ahaadith.\n\nThe easiest and most common form for Istighfaar is 'Astaghfirullah' (I seek\nAllah's forgiveness). One should, at the time of reciting Istighfaar bring\nto mind the presence of Allah and seek forgiveness from one's heart.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
