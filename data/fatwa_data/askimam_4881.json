  "question": "As salamu alaikum dear Mufti, a question on Shia.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is the truth of the 12 Imams that Shias believe. They give this Hadith: Narrated Jabir ibn Samura: I heard the Prophet peace be upon him saying: ?There will be 12 commanders.? He then said a sentence that I did not hear. My father said, the Prophet peace be upon him added: ?All will be from Quriash?. A Bukhari, (Arabic) 4:165, Kitabul Ahkam. What is the truth about this? Also, what is the proof that Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him, and and the other 3 first Caluiphs should be Caliph before Ali may Allah be pleased with him? In my opinion, it isn?t significant, but Shia think otherwise. Jazakallah. P.s. could you please answer my old question 4506. Jazakallah!!!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere is absolutely no truth in the claims and beliefs of the Shi'ash.\nKindly refer Shiaism - attached.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
