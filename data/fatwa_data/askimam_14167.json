  "question": "is it permisssible to invest in this business since it involves bank loan?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nThe bank is going to provide a loan that has to be repaid in about 5 years. What I mean by my friend being short of 50% is that for example, if the cost of the project/business is 2 million, the bank is providing a loan of 1 million. My friend has to use his own resources to come up with the remaining amount of 1 million. Now my question is that in this case is it permisssible to invest in this business since it involves bank loan?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to our understanding of your query, the bank is not entering into a partnership with your friend. It will simply be offering an interest bearing loan.\n\nIf our understanding of your query is correct, then we advise that there are two different issues; a) The Loan, and b) Partnership/profits.\n\nIn principle, it is not permissible to take an interest bearing loan. If one does not have sufficient money to start a big business venture, he should not do so. He should consider a smaller venture within his financial means. However, if your friend commenced a business with the loaned amount and you invested in such a business, the profits will be permissible. However, your friend will be sinful for being involved in interest. Furthermore, such a business is void of barakah and blessings.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
