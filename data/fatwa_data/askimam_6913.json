  "answer": "QUESTION\ncould you answer the following, 1.Is there a Hadith telling us to pray at the nearest mosque to our house? 2.What is the Challenge of the Quran,some believe it regarding to 1 Surah and others believe this to be regarding 1 Ayat? 3.In Salaat when going down to perform Sajda should hands be placed on the knees? 4.How and when should itr(perfume) be applied(ie after Wudhu,and on the right hand) 5.I suffer from doubt(during and after Wudhu) how can this be fought? 6.If you dont recite Bismillah before Wudhu is Wudhu valid?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is the right of the Musjid nearest to that you perform Salaat therein. (Aap ke Masaail vol.2 pg.138)\n\n2. Initially, the challenge of the Qur?aan was for the disbelievers to bring forth 10 Surahs of the Qur?aan, but later to prove their helplessness, Allah challenged them to bring 1 Surah. (Ma?ariful Qur?aan vol.4 pg.601)\n\n3. No, the hands must not be placed on the knees. (Ahsanul Fataawa vol.4 pg.50)\n\n4. It is reported in a Hadith that in any good action Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to begin from the right. Therefore, you should apply Itr on the right hand. It is not necessary to apply Itr after Wudhu. It may be applied at any time.\n\n5. In order to overcome doubt you should continue making the Wudhu.\n\n6. It is Mustahabb (preferable) to recite Bismillah in Wudhu. Therefore, if Bismillah is not read, it is not necessary to repeat the Wudhu.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
