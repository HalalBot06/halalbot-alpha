  "question": "Can i use interest to pay my childrens fees?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease advise if I am able to use interest monies to pay for my childrens' education? I was previously advised that the interest monies may be used to build toilets, pay traffic fines or be given to a non muslim however I have heard that the monies may be used to pay for childrens' education. Please advise\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nInterest money should be disposed off by giving it away to the poor and needy. If you are poor and needy and you are a legitimate recipient of zakat, then you also qualify as a recipient of interest monies. You may use the monies to fulfill your needs.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
