  "question": "I need to know the meanings of some names and a question regarding women. 2. After a woman delivers, is she allowed to read namaz within the 40 day time period if she stops bleeding?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. I asked you a question a month ago (#9313) about the meanings of the name Elsa and Manahil. I am aware that the name Manahil is mostly used in Saudi Arabia (restaurants and clothing stores). So far I have found out different meanings of this name, please give me anything that you know about this name and if its a good name to keep. 2. After a woman delivers, is she allowed to read namaz within the 40 day time period if she stops bleeding? and if she doesnt stop bleeding even after the 40 day period, can she make salaat then?? When does salaat become farz for her regarding this time period? Please answer these questions as soon as possible.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We are unaware of such names. The closest meaning we could attain for Manaahil is beehive.\n\n2. Forty days is the maximum amount of days for Nifaas, i.e. bleeding after childbirth. Hence, if a woman stops bleeding within the forty days, then she has to make Ghusl (take a bath) and continue with Salaat as normal. If she continues bleeding even after the forty days, then she will follow the laws of Istihaadha, i.e. she will have to renew her Wudhu for the beginning of every Salaat time and perform Salaat in this way.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
