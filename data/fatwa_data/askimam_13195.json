  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI need to know what are therights of an unmarried pregnant woman. Can she go to the mosque and give salaat. Ca she fast or is she obligated to pay for a missed fast.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to the Shariâ€™ah, if a person committed fornication or adultery, that is a major sin. Such a person will be punished in an Islamic state under the laws of Hudood. If the person is not in an Islamic state or the person was not convicted, then he/she should repent to Allah for committing the sin. This is a matter between the individual and Allah. The community does not have any independent right to take any action against the person.\n\nA child born out of wedlock is not attributed to the biological father. It is the mother that bears all the responsibilities of such a child.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
