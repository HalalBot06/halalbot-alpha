  "question": "He wants to keep one wife and divorce the other",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf a man has two wives, in different countries, and whatever he does he cant keep equality between the two in time spending, intimacy etc.   he is scared of Allah, so he is thinking of staying with the wife he has 3 children with, and divorcing the one he has no children with. (she is in another country and has children from a previous marriage). What would the Prophet PBUH say to this?\n\nThe Prophet PBUH said if you cant keep equality between wives, then marry only one. does this also apply after a man has already married two wives, and he cant maintan them or cant fulfil a wifes rights? can he go back to having just one wife and divorce the other.\n\nThe man is Allah fearing and is scared to come on the Day of Judgement with one side paralysed because he couldn't keep equality. What would Allah say? Is the mans thinking correctly that he should divorce one wife to save himself on the Day of Judgement?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1.      Why can’t he bring her to his country of residence? If this is not possible at the moment, he may ask her (the one in the foreign country) to forego her rights in favour of the other one.\n\n2.      It refers to maintenance and spending equal amount of time with each of them it does not refer to equality in cohabitation or love.\n\nAnd Allah knows best"
