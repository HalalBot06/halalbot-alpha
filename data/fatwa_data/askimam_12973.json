  "question": "How can we stop spreading Shirk in the society?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nRespected Brother-in-Islam. We have a very disturbing situation in our community. There is a person who claims that he has Jinnat in his control. As a matter of fact he has shown some unusual activities and juggling to the people. Now many people have accepted him as a spiritual leader and go to him for their needs. Some believe Nauz-o-Billah he can do anything he wishes. He is getting money from them and if they stop going to him he creates wearisome and trouble for them. I believe this is causing a huge Shirk in the society. They are on the wrong track. Please advise how can we stop this baneful disease.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe control of a Jinn does not indicate the religiousness of a person. It is possible for a person to control a Jinn. His unusual activities or miraculous feats does not make him a pious man. Yes, if he is a staunch adherent of the Sunnah, he is a pious man and the miraculous feats he performs are from Allah, otherwise they are from Shaytaan.\n\nThe people need to correct their beliefs. Benefit and harm does not lie in his hands. If the people think that he is deceiving them, they should abstain from him and turn to Allah for assistance against the mischief of such miscreants.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT."
