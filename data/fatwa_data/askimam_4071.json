  "question": "Moon Sighting",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn different parts of the world moon is sighted on different days. Should we follow the local shahadat or the moon sighted any where in the world. Please give the answer in detail with references. I heard a Hadith that a Sahabi Radi Allahu came to Rasoolullah and told that In a perticular place the moon has been sighted He replied that they should follow that. Also, A sahabi came and greeted eid to Rasoolullah while they were fasting. He told that I have travelled from some place where last evening I did saw the moon. The prophet broke his fast and the Eid prayers were offered the next day.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer below our standard reply to similar query.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Jurists (Fuqahaa) have differences of opinion on whether%0D%0AIkhtilaaf-e-Mataalih is considered (Mu'tabar) or not. According to the%0D%0AZaahir-e-Riwaayat (view considered for Fatwa), it is not considered which%0D%0Ameans that one reliable sighting anywhere (not only Saudia Arabia) in the%0D%0Aworld is valid. However, the problem in the sighting of the moon, is that%0D%0Athere are many errors in the sighting of the moon in Saudi Arabia. If the%0D%0Aerrors are rectified and after Shahaadah of an individual%2Fs sighting the%0D%0Amoon, decision is taken in consultation with the officials of the Hilaal%0D%0ASighting Committee, then it will be valid for the entire Muslim Ummah.%0D%0ASimilar procedures must be put in place in other countries as well, as the%0D%0Amoon may be sighted elsewhere and not necessarily Saudia Arabia.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn view of the present discrepancies in moon sighting, the view that%0D%0AIkhtilaaf-e-Mataalih is considered should be adopted and each country should%0D%0Amake their own independent decisions. It is incorrect for the Muslims in%0D%0ANorth America (especially the Arab brethren) to follow Saudia Arabia's%0D%0Aruling on Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha due to the moonsighting being%0D%0Ainconsistent with Shari'ah laws of sighting the moon.%0D%0A"
