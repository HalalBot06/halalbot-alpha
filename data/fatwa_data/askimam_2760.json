  "question": "Is a Muslim allowed to be married in more than one ritual?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf I am to marry a male who is newly converting to Islam without his parents knowing, is it permissable for me to do their marriage ritual (for a Sikh religion) for his parents sake along with my Nikah? He does not want to upset his parents, and since they don't know about his conversion yet, it will be awkward not to perform their ritual. Please guide me on what to do. Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, it is not permissible to follow the customs and rituals of\nother religions merely to avoid an awkward situation.\n\nThe male should apply wisdom and diplomacy in informing his parents and\nfamily of his reversion to Islam. If he is unable to do so due to the fear\nof being severely punished, etc. then only will he be excused.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
