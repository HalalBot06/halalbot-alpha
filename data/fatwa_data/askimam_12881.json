  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalaamualaikum Dear Mufti Sahab. I hope you?re doing well inshallah. Listerine® is a leading non-prescription anitseptic mouthwash. Howver I noticed it said on its ingredients 21.6% Alcohol. Therefore, I e-mailed their manufacturer and asked if the Alcohol is derived from Grapes or dates, if the Alcohol can intoxicate, and if any other ingredients used in it are animal derived. Alhumdulillah they responded and Listerine® mouthwash contains No animal derived ingredients, its alcohol is synthetically made from petroleum, but he said it may intoxicate only if swallowed (which its not to be swallowed, only gargled). Therefore I am not sure now if its permissible yet. Can you please give me the fatwah if its permissible? Here is the exact e-mail he sent me >>> ?Dear Mohammed, Thank you for your inquiry concerning our Listerine® Antiseptic mouthrinses. None of the ingredients in Listerine are derived from animals. The alcohol in Listerine may cause intoxication if swallowed, however the product is not intented for ingestion. Listerine is expectorated not ingested. The source of the alcohol is synthetic, it is special denatured alcohol from petroleum sources. Listerine Antiseptic mouthrinse has been extensively used for over 115 years. It is the only leading non-prescription antimicrobial mouthrinse to have been granted the prestigious American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs' Seal of Acceptance for both safety and effectiveness.?
