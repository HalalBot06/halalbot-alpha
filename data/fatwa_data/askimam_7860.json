  "answer": "QUESTION\nWe live in uk.Here the floor of the houses are covered with the carpets. We are living in a house since 2 years. there were some little damages(on carpets) caused by us.Those are not that much observable.Even though the house agent observe I think they will not mind. No we are going to vacate the house very soon.Now my question is whether I have to tell the house agent about the damages done on the carpet.Or Do we have to leave for their observation.Generally while vacating the house our agent see whether there are any damages in the house. If found they will fine us.(The probelm is that if I tell him about the damages done by me on my own,He may fine us. In other scenario,if he finds on his own,he may overlook thinking that the damages are not that big.Ofcousrse If the damages are taht big he will easily observe them I think.)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is necessary for you to inform the agent of your damages to the house before vacating it.\n\nWe suggest before vacating the premises, you repair the damages privately, thus, saving yourself from the fine imposed by the agent.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
