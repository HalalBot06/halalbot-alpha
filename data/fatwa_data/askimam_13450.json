  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs a girl's fiancee allowed to see her without scarf(or just her hair) before they are married?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to Shariah, the laws of Hijaab will apply between the boy and the girl until the Nikah is performed. It is not permissible for the boy and girl to have any communication whatsoever before marriage. The fiancé/fiancée concept has no basis in Shari’ah and to a great extent un-Islamic.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
