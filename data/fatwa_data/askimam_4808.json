  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease provide any related Hadith.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQ: Is it permissible to sacrifice an animal and pass the reward to a\ndeceased relative?\nA: There are two aspects: 1) to make a voluntary sacrifice on behalf of any\nperson e.g. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), a relative, etc. This\nis permissible, the person will get the reward of the sacrifice. However,\none must discharge his obligation of sacrifice separately. The sacrifice on\nbehalf of any other person will not suffice for one's own obligatory\nsacrifice.\n2) To make one's compulsory sacrifice and thereafter make an intention of\ngiving the reward to the deceased. In such a case, the compulsory sacrifice\nof the person will be discharged.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
