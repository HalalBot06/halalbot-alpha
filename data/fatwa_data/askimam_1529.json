  "question": "Is it permissable for a hanafi female to marry a muslim without her parents consent?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am a Hanafi female who wishes to marry a muslim guy,but the thing is my parents dont want me to marry him because they want me to have an arranged marriage.I have done istikhaara and I feel I should go ahead and get married insha allah my parents will change there mind.Is it right to marry without parents consent?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nWhen a female becomes an adult by attaining puberty, she has an independant\nright to choose her marriage partner. Therefore, in principle, she does not\nrequire the consent of her parents. However, since marriage is a big and\nimportant step in a females life, she should be careful in choosing her\npartner by making istikhaara (seeking Divine Guidance). See Istikhaarah at:\nwww.jamiat.org.za/isinfo/istikhaara.html as well as consult (make mashwara)\nwith her near and dear ones, for example parents. There love and concern for\nher will be of meaningful assistance to her.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti E Desai\nFatwa Dept."
