  "question": "I want to check if my name, Muhammed Qayyum, is OK.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSome people object on this name and they told me that It should be Abdul Qayyum Anwer. Please help me to know what is OK and let me know also how the name effects on the life.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nQayyum is an arabic word in the intensive sense meaning absolute self\nsubsisting. That is the sole quality of Allah Ta'ala. It is incorrect to\nname a person Qayyum without a prefix of Abdul, meaning the slave of Qayyum.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best.\n\nMufti E. Desai"
