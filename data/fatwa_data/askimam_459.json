  "question": "Can a man divorce his wife during pregnancy?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDuring pregnancy the husband should be extremely tolerant to his wife and\nexpress more care and affection to her as she bears all the difficulties of\ncarrying his child. Divorce by itself is disliked; imagine giving it in the\nstate of pregnancy. However, despite the husband's uncalled behaviour,\ndivorce given in the state of pregnancy is valid.\n\nFrom Al Mahmood 10"
