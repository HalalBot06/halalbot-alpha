  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMashaAllah, your concern and query 'about marriage on Islam before engaging in customary weddings is very encouraging. Often large customary weddings have led to disastrous marriages.%0D%0A%0D%0AWhen looking for a partner, first look or someone pious and Allah-fearing, for if he fears Allah, he most certainly will fear Allah in his rights to his wife. Beauty, wealth, occupation is a bonus. However importance of compatibility is essential. Another requirement of seeing the person is essential. This establishes agreeability in the need of developing love and affection. However courtship and continuous meeting is not permissible before marriage.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe marriage ceremony must be as simple as possible which will result with blessings and not burdans. A womn has a right to dowry to her wish determined by his social and financial situation. A public declaration with the Nikah contracted in the presence of at least two withnesses. As far as a women preparing herself for her husband, besides a women's natural instinct to beautify herself for her partner, this is a necessity from day one of marriage life long with her partner. The first night is discovering each other with patience every individual, depending on their own natural instinct.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe walima meal is a great honour for the wife and an outward expression of gratitude to Allah for His Ta'alas favours.(The walima is dependant on affortability and must include the poor)%0D%0A%0D%0AHence the Nikah is very simple, however if there are queries related to any specific areas, the topic is quite vast therefore the need to specify whether from the emotional, social, needs or mas'alas is essential. You are most welcome to query further.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0A2SOCIAL DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A"
