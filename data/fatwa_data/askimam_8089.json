  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have recently returned from my Haj,when we went on Ziyaarat I noticed that the Saudis have destroyed and covered up much of the islamic history and sights which were kerp from Nabi(SAW) time till about 20 years ago.In Medina and Mecca many places like the house of BIbi Fatima has been closed off,why are they destroying the history 2) Is the Wahabi govt the correct government ,they rule Saudi?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nHistorical events and places are of great importance and significance. However, there is no separate reward or any special blessings attached to such places. The object is to take heed.\n\nTherefore, if the need arises to add, subtract or strengthen or extend, this is permissible. Even the Baytullah was strengthened and renovated many times. Therefore especially in times like today, when millions of people are coming from Hajj, there was a serious need to accommodate these guests of Allah, hence, the necessary hotels and apartments had to be built around and near the Haram.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
