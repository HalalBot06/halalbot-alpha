  "question": "I have read that it is forbidden to take photographs. So my question is: Is it also then forbidden to have a mirror at home as both the camera and mirror capture images?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nBy photographs I mean of family and friends with or without hijab. Kept in albums or displayed ina living room.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n%0D%0APicture frames and photographs of animate objects are not permissible to%0D%0Adisplay. Frames having pictures of inanimate objects e.g. trees, mountains,%0D%0Aetc. are permissible.%0D%0A- Hadhrat Abu Talha (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) narrates that Nabi (Sallallaahu%0D%0A%C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'Angels do not enter a house wherein there is a dog%0D%0Aor picture.' (Mishk%E3t vol. 2 p. 385)%0D%0A? %C1bdullah ibn Mas%F3od (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) narrates that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'The people with the most severe%0D%0Apunishment by Allah will be the picture makers.' (Ibid).%0D%0A? Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (RA) narrates, 'I heard the messenger of Allah saying,%0D%0A\"Every picture-maker will be in the fire.
