  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it halal for muslims to fabricate evidence and assume refugee status and seek asylum in the west i.e. USA,UK,Germany,France etc. and live on the government dole?\n\nPlease give me an elaborate fatwa on this soon as many muslims in my country are doing so.\n\nÂ \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nSharih has emphasized on speaking truth. To speak lies is a major sin and incurs the anger and wrath of Allah. It is a sin to fabricate evidence and distort facts to qualify for refugee status anywhere in the world.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
