  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have commited a shirk , When I was 17 or 18 years old I had been to a small temple with one of my Hindu friends and I threw some flowers on it.\n\nI have fallen in love with a hindu girl that time.\n\nI do not remember If I had asked for something during that time.\n\nI am 27 years old now.. I feel ashamed when I remeber what I have done.. I follow my prayers and I am have deep regrets for what I have done.\n\nWhat shall I do so that I get forgiven for what I have done ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\nIf a person commits any form of sin, including Kufr and Shirk and he sincerely repents, he will be forgiven by Allah Ta’ala.The forgiveness of Allah Ta’ala is never-ending as long as one is pure and sincere in his/her Tawbah from the sin. When one commits a sin and repents with sincerity to Allah Ta’ala he must have full conviction that his forgiveness is accepted.\n\n \n\nAllah Ta’ala says in the Quran:\n\nقُلْ يَا عِبَادِيَ الَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُوا عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ لا تَقْنَطُوا مِن رَّحْمَةِ اللَّهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ جَمِيعًا إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ.(الزمر، 53)\n\nSay: “O My slaves who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah: verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”(Quran 39: 53)\n\n \n\nIf a person enters a temple, it will not constitute shirk, however it is a major sin. You have mentioned that you are unaware of what you asked for. This also will not constitute shirk. In both situations sincere repentance ought to be made with a firm determination never to repeat the mistake.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
