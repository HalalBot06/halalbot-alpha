  "question": "Is it obligatory for her to marry him and only him coz they had physical relationship?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAs-Salaam-U-Alaikum...\n\n \n\nMy friend(a girl) liked and started to love someone and they indulged in physical relationship(only once), she repents it and knows that she has committed a sin.Now she saw the real, worst face of him, which is not good. She doesnt want to get married to him. Is it obligatory for her to marry him and only him coz they had physical relationship?\n{She doesnt want to marry him coz he showed the real 'him' once he thought that she is in her control.He is of a much doubting nature and she has to listen to him and seek permission for everything.he even hurts her mentally and is black mailing her with dire consequences on her family if she refuses to marry.}\n\n \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nYour friend does not have to marry that person. She should not give in to his pressure. All power and conditions lie in Allah. This experience should serve as an eye opener to your friend. Islam prohibits courting and dating before marriage. This is also to safeguard women. They are vulnerable to sweet talking men. When they are used and caught in the web, they are abused. Had they followed the guidelines of shariah and resisted, they would not become victims of abusive men. Young girls and women should be alive to this reality and guard themselves.\n\nNevertheless, all is not lost. Advise your friend to turn to Allah and obey Allah to the best of her ability. Follow the rules and guidelines set down by shariah in searching for a marriage partner and getting married. If a woman looks after her honor, she will be treated with honor.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
