  "question": "Is tasawwur of a non-mahram woman is also haram? Is lobster haram for the Shafiis as well?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. To fantasise and make Tasawwur of a non-Mahram woman is Haraam, and\ntantamount to committing Zina with the heart and mind, as mentioned in the\nHadith. It is recorded in Shaami that, 'just as it is Haraam to look at that\nwhich is not permissible, it is Haraam to even think and ponder over that\nwhich is not permissible.' (Raddul Mukhtaar vol.5 pg.263; Rashidiyya)\n2. Consuming lobsters for Shaaf'ees is permissible. (Sharhul Muhadhab vol.9\npg.30)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
