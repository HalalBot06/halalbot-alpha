  "question": "Do I have to always make dua formally like with wudhu, starting and ending with durood, sitting and raising hands etc.?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. Regarding the last question on dua. Do I have to always make dua formally like with wudhu, starting and ending with durood, sitting and raising hands etc.? or I can just say in my mind anything good and not anything prohibited while in sitting, walking, eating without starting with durood and masnun dua' etc. and in my mind (without uttering)? Like I'm sitting before the computer looking for jobs in the web. If I find any good one, can I just say without uttering a word \"O Allaah, please grant me this job for me.\"  Will this be considered as dua'?\n\n2. I like to know little bit on sabahah named Fairuz (RA).\n\nJazakallaah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIt is from the teachings of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and the etiquettes of du’aa that one should be in the state of Wudhu, be seated, face the Qiblah, raising one’s hands, etc. Therefore, for the acceptance of one’s du’aa, one should try to observe the various etiquettes.\n\nI would like to inform you that the correct method of making du’aa is to begin praising Allah, thereafter send salutations upon Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam], then one should ask for his needs (pertaining to the world and the hereafter), then once again send salutations upon Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] and end off by praising Allah. It is commonly believed that one should start and end one’s du’aa with Durood. This is contrary to the teachings of Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam].\n\nIt will be permissible to make du’aa sitting in front of the computer. However, the principle of du’aa is that one should be attentive. Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] is reported to have said, ‘Verily, Allah does not accept the du’aa of an unattentive heart.’ (al-Azkar pg.399)\n\nFayruz al-Daylami [radhiallaahu anhu] was a Sahaabi who narrated Ahaadith from Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]. He was a Yemeni and the one to assassinate Aswad Anasi (one who claimed Prophethood after Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam]). Some historians view that he passed away in the era of Uthmaan [radhiallaahu anhu] while others view that he passed away in the time of Mu’aawiyah [radhiallaahu anhu]. (Tadreeb wal Tahzeeb pg.522; Tahzibul Kamaal vol.23 pg.322)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
