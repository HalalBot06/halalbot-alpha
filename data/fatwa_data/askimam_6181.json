  "question": "Should I read hizmet books. Are they authentic and correct teachings?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have been reading books off of the website hizmetbooks.org (hakikat bookstore, instanbul). I am wondering if these books are authentic and whether I should be reading them. For example, there is a book called \"Confessions of a British Spy\" that says muhammed bin abdul wahhab was influenced by a british spy. The other books are very pro-taqleed and very anti- la maddhabi. Please let me know whether I should pursue reading some of these books and PLEASE STATE WHY OR WHY NOT.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe are unaware of the exact contents of these books and are therefore unable\nto offer any comment.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Muhammad ibn Moulana Haroon Abbassommar\nFACULTY OF SPECIALTY IN HADITH\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
