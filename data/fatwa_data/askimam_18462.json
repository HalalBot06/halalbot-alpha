  "question": "Regarding watching of porn movies before getting married. Regarding Saying salam how should one reply ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nRegarding watching of porn movies before getting married. Regarding Saying salam how should one reply ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\n1.   Marriage is the beginning of a life-long undertaking. It requires from both spouses a promising and positive input. For this reason, preparations are set in motion long before the date of nikāh. Similarly, it is crucial that both spouses spiritually develop themselves before nikāh whereby it is a means of barakah (blessings). Watching of movies, especially porn, will definitely result in a decrease of spirituality. Therefore, it is utterly repulsive and harām (forbidden) in Islām to watch any type of pornography.                  (See Fatwa #18396, Moulana Mohammed Moola)\n\nPlease refer to the following link for better input.\nhttp://www.askimam.org/fatwa/fatwa.php?askid=2c81b91510434d4d11db5e2d71b862b7\n\n \n\n2.   The best words that a person may use when intending to greet another are “As-salāmu `alaykum wa rahmatullāhi wabarakātuh” and the reply should be “Wa-`alaykum us-salām wa rahmatullāhi wabarakātuh”.\n\n \n\n(Fatāwa Mahmūdiyyah, Jamia Farooqia, Vol 19, Pg 60)\n\n\n\nHakimul Ummat Hadhrat Moulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi Rahmatullahi Allai in his book Aadabul Muaasharaat has mentioned the following etiquettes of Salaam.\n\nIn a gathering where a talk or discussion is taking place, the person entering should not draw attention to himself by making Salaam. He should not interfere in the talk. He should lower his gaze and silently sit down. When later the opportunity arises, he should make Salaam.\nAdopt the practice of mutual Salaam. Whenever meeting a Muslim, say: Assalamualaikum. In reply say Walaikumus Salaam.\nAll other ways are baseless.\nWhen a person conveys the Salaams of another to you, reply: Alayhim Wa Alaikumus Salaam. This is best. If someone replies: Walaikumus Salaam, It will also suffice.\nOne person of the group making Salaam will be representative of the whole group. His Salaam will be adequate on behalf of the group. Similarly, if from the gathering one person replied, it will suffice on behalf of the whole gathering.\nThe one initiates the Salaam obtains greater thawaab (reward).\nWhen replying to the Salaam of a person, the Salaam should be made verbally, not by a sign of the hand or a nod of the head.\nBetter repayment for a favour will be when the repayment is somewhat more than the act of favour rendered. Thus, the reply should be more than the Salaam (greeting). If Assalamualaikum was said, the better reply will be Walaikumus Salaam Warahmatullah. If Wa Barakaatuhu is also added it will be an added merit.\nIt is Wajib (obligatory) to reply to the Salaam which is written in a letter. This reply may be in writing or verbally.\nThe Fuqaha have said that in a reply to the Salaam which is written in a letter, one may say Alaikumus Salaam or even Assalamu Alaikum.\n In a letter in which a dua is written, the Salaam should be written first since this is the Sunnah method.\n Instead of writing or saying the Salaam, to say any other term or to adopt the greeting of any other community is bidah. Such an alien greeting is in fact alteration of the Shariah.\n A person who is engrossed in a conversation or in some work should not be greeted. The new-comer should not intrude with his hand-shaking. Such an act is uncultured and causes distress to others.\n It is Makrooh (Abominable  - disliked) to greet a person involved in deeni or natural activity. Thus, to make Salaam to a person eating is Makrooh while it is not Makrooh (Abominable  - disliked) to engage in conversation while eating.\n It is not permissible to bow and make Salaam.\n Before entering a house or any place of privacy it is necessary to seek permission. Do not enter without permission.\n Stand outside and proclaim the Salaam, then ask permission in any language. Use such terms which convey the full meaning. However, as far as the Salaam itself is concerned only the terms of Shariah should be used.\n When answering the call of nature neither reply to anyone’s Salaam nor offer Salaam.\n On promising to convey a person’s Salaam it becomes Wajib to do so, otherwise not.\n When making Salaam to elders adopt a low voice. Do not express your self in such terms which convey arrogance or disrespect.\n\n(Aadabul Muaasharat -etiquettes of social life-, publisher YMMA, Pg 12)\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\n\n\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n\n\n\nMl.
