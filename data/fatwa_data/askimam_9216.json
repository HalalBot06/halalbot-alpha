  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have been having a relationship with a married man for a year now. The wife is not living with him yet, she is living in her country. He asked me to marry him last year before he married her but I was hesitant, and for one reason or another he married her. However, we have been seeing each other this past year and I have recently become pregnant. What should we do? We are both muslim, I am 20 and he is 29.
