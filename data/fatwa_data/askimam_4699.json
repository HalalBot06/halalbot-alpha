  "answer": "QUESTION\nIs there any indication in Quran and hadith that there could be only four imam. Why after four imams no imam comes. Also what is the difference between four imams and the muftees of present days. Khuda Hafiz\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) There is no indication in the Qur'an and Hadith that there can be only%0D%0Afour Imams. However, the four well known Imams were authorities in their%0D%0Afield. They had dedicated their lives in gaining an indepth understanding of%0D%0Athe Shariah of Islam. More importantly, they successfully managed to%0D%0Adocument and codify the Shariah : thus enabling the ordinary person to%0D%0Aeasily practise upon the Shariah.%0D%0AThere were many other capable scholars, however, with the passage of time%0D%0Aonly these 4 schools of jurispudence gained prominence. One should%0D%0Aunderstand well, that becoming a mujtahid or an Imaam is no simple task.%0D%0AThere are certain basic requirements before one is conferred with the title%0D%0Aof a mujtahid or an imam.%0D%0AA scholar who :-%0D%0Aa. has gained full expertise in all branches of Islamic knowledge such as%0D%0ATafsir, Hadith, Fiqh, Arabic and their related sciences;%0D%0Ab. has deep-rooted insight & understanding of the goals and objectives of%0D%0AShariah;%0D%0Ac. has the keen ability of extracting principles from the Quraan & Sunnah%0D%0Aand then being able to infer verdicts from them; and%0D%0Ad. is extremely pious and sincere in his teachings.%0D%0A%0D%0ASince these 4 Imams possessed these requirements they more than adequately%0D%0Aanalysed and synthesised the Shariah. Consequently, the need for a 5th or%0D%0Aany other Imam does not exist.%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The Muftis of current times are merely transmitters of the views of the%0D%0AMujtahids of the past. They themselves are not mujtahids. Their task is to%0D%0Amerely study the works of the 4 Imams & provide appropriate solutions to%0D%0Acontemporary problems based on the deductions of the Mujtahiddeen of the%0D%0Apast.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
