  "question": "Am i allowed to work as a Doctor whilst donning the Niqab?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\ni,am a doctor from india,presently in us.alhamdulilah i practise hijab,pray namaz etc.\nmy question is if i'am allowed to work as a doctor with hijab and niqab,to help the sick  in the community. or just leave the profession and stay at home with kids.\nwhich one is better as a muslim .\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nAlhamdulillah, it is pleasing to note that you are practicing on the sunnah and the commands of Allah Ta'ala. May Allah Ta'ala in His infinite Mercy and Rahmah reward you abundantly in this world and the aagirah and may He guide all of us to take our deen seriously. Ameen.  I was listening to a nasheed last night and the words went something to the effect that, 'Ask the lady who is covered up from head to toe why she is dressed up like that and she will tell you, \"I am a Muslim.\"\n\nAllahu Akbar, what greater honour can Allah Ta'ala bestow upon one, other than the great deen of Islam!\n\nSeeing that you ask about continuing to work, I need to ask  you how many children you have, what their ages are and if they need you to be home all day?\n\nAre they all at school and do they need you to be with them once they are home? Also, are you self supporting and in need of a steady income?\n\nIf you are in need of an income, it may be a good idea to serve your community with your niqab on. Is there a possibility that you have your own practice and you serve women and children only?  If the children need you, how about a part time practice in the mornings or at a convenient time?\n\nWe have lots of female doctors here in who are allowed to serve with their niqabs in public hospitals. Insha'allah it will be possible for you to do so too.\n\nYou may find it difficult at first but with Allah Ta'ala's guidance you will find that you will command a great deal of respect and it will also serve as a means of making dawaah as many other women will ask you about your attire and this is an excellent moment to speak about the virtues of Islam and the position of women in Islam.  \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nSister Fadila\nSocial Dept.\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
