  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI am doing development of a mobile device, where I need to put Aazan and Duaa in the mobile. I want to know, if there is a copyright for this sound? And is there any department where i need to seek permission for.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nWe are unaware of the secular legal copyrights set on various Adhans and Duās; neither are we aware of the relative departments to contact for such information. In regards to the Shar‘ī perspective, it will be permissible for you to load the Adhān and Du‘ās on the mobile. In regards to the secular legal aspect, you should enquire from the legal experts of your locality.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam u Alaikum\n\nMl.
