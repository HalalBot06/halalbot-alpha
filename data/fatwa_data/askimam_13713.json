  "question": "when a husband calls his wife to bed, she must answer his call. Does she exercise the same right over her husband?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI know that when a husband calls his wife to bed, she must answer his call. Does she exercise the same right over her husband?\n\nI know that if a woman refuses her husband to bed, the angels curse her till dawn. What if the husband refuses his wife? She has rights over him too.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nOne of the primary purposes of Nikah is to protect the chastity of the spouses from Haraam. This is a common factor shared by both the husband and wife.\n\nThe reason why it is necessary for the wife to answer his call is that the husband should not resort to Haraam. Since the wife also needs her desires to be fulfilled in a Halaal way in order to save herself from Haraam, she will have similar rights over the husband.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
