  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI have a dentist appoinment tomorrow and they are most probably taking my braces off. This will make me bleed from my mouth and they will add water and this may cause blood/water to go down my throat. Also, they might add some other substances that have taste/flavour in my mouth. This is a problem because this is the month of ramadan and i am fasting. Would that break my fast? And if it does, should I fast tomorrow or miss the fast and make up for it after? Please advise me the best solution to this problem.\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIn principle, fast remains intact as long as water, blood and any other substance does not pass beyond the throat. If possible, try and get appointment after Maghrib or after Ramadhan to avoid this situation.\n\n(Aap Kay Masail, Vol.3, Pg.290, Matabah Bayyinaat)\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl.
