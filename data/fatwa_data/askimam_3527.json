  "question": "Assalamu Alaykum, I would like to know how gheebah is forgiven. Can it be forgiven by Allah(SWT) alone. Does gheebah apply to kafirs and munafiks. I appreciate your help!",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is narrated on the authority of Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed and Jaabir%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhuma) that Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) mentioned,%0D%0A'Gheebat (backbiting) is worse than committing Zina.' The Sahaaba%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhum) enquired the reason for that. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) replied, 'When a person commits Zina and thereafter repents to%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala, he is forgiven by Allah but a person who made Gheebat is not%0D%0Aforgiven by Allah until he is forgiven by the person whose Gheebat he made.'%0D%0A%0D%0AIt becomes apparent from the above Hadith that Gheebat is such a sin that%0D%0Afalls within the ambit of Huqooqul Ibaad (where the rights of a fellow being%0D%0Ais usuerped). Hence, it will be necessary to obtain forgiveness from the%0D%0Apersons whose Gheebat was made first and then only will one be forgiven by%0D%0AAllah Ta'ala. However, according to some Ulama, if the Gheebat does not%0D%0Areach the ears of the person, it will not come under Huqooqul Ibaad.%0D%0ATherefore, it will not be necessary to ask him for forgiveness but together%0D%0Awith that, he will have to falsify what he had said about that particular%0D%0Aperson (one whose Gheebat was made) to the person he said it to.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf that person has passed away or his whereabouts are not known, then we%0D%0Ahave been taught in a Hadith reported by Hadhrat Anas (Radhiallaahu Anhu)%0D%0Athat Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, 'The recompense of Gheebat is%0D%0Ato supplicate to Allah Ta'ala for one's own forgiveness and for that of the%0D%0Aperson whose Gheebat was made.' The Du'aa taught to us is, 'Allaahumma%0D%0Aighfir lanaa.'%0D%0A%0D%0AThere is no sin attached to making Gheebat of Munaafiqs and Kaafirs, but why%0D%0Ashould one engage himself in such a frivolous act? Rather, one should make%0D%0ADhikr, Tilaawat, etc. (Ma'ariful Qur'aan vol.8 pg.122)%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0Afor: Mufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0ACHECKED AND APPROVED: Moulana Imraan Vawda %2F Mufti Muhammad Kadwa"
