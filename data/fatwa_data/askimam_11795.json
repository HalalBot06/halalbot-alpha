  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have a problem. I look like a famous person here in England called David Baddiel (he is a comedian). At first I thought this was a good thing as it made me popular, but now it has turned into a curse. People call me Dave all the time aand it has come to define my whole life. It is really annoying and depressing. Please help me. I don't understand why Allah would give me this curse. Why can't he make me an individual? Please help!\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAll praise due to Almighty Allah who has created us from a drop of sperm and thereafter shaped us and moulded us. This is proof for us that we cannot control our outward appearance, but it is controlled by the All-Wise Allah Ta?ala. Allah in His infinite wisdom is most knowledgeable as to why some of us are created tall and others short, some fair skinned and others dark. Allah is also aware that He has created some people who resemble others.\n\nAlhamdulillah, you have found someone who resembles you in your life. Du?aa should be made for your look alike that Allah grants him Hidaayah. It is a pity that he has become a great influence on the community in his kufr. You have not let his influence beguile you to mate him as your role model. Allah has kept the spirit of Imaam burning in your heart. Remind the people around you that you are not a kafir and you are a Muslim faithful to your Deen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
