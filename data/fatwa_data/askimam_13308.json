  "answer": "QUESTION\na Non Muslim who hates muslim has asked me the following questions and due to my ignorance i am unable to answer them in a appropriate way.\n\n1. Given that Hagar was Egyptian, and Ishmael her son - would that not make Ishmael (father of the Arabs) half Egyptian?\n2. Why do fundamentalists take the Koran so literally where as others apply a more modern thought to the writings?\n3. Accepting the Koran is the most important literature in Islamic faith, do you also follow the Hadiths?\n4. Why is it so important to setup a Muslim community in Australia?\n5. Is an infidel simply one who doesn't submit to Allah/Islam?\n6. Considering the Koran openly states to use violence on infidels - do you agree or is there another interpation?\n7. Mohammad consumated his marriage with his nine year old bride. Is this not child molestation? And if not, how can one justify this action by a said prophet of Allah.\n8. Granted other monothesic religions have engaged in wars; can you explain why Islamic Faith has the most known terrorists in the world?\n9. Why doesn't the Muslim actively seek out fundamentalists agmonst their community and report them to the hosting Western Authorities?\n10. How can Muslim faith be called a peaceful faith, when it's whole history almost since inception has been nothing but wars and violent actions?\n\nJasakallah for answering everyone, including my questions.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nBefore we answer the specific queries, take note of the following:\n\nAs Muslims, it is our duty to conduct ourselves with non-Muslims with kindness. It was the noble habit of Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasalaam) that he treated non-Muslims with kindness. It is through his kindness and noble character many non-Muslims accepted Islam. In the early days of Islam, Nabi saw an old woman carrying a load. He approached her and requested to assist her in her burden. He carried the load and en route the old woman remarked \" I am migrating from Mecca because I have been informed that a person called Muhammed has emerged and he is renouncing the religion of our forefathers and bad mouthing our idol gods\". She continued talking ill about Nabi (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasalaam), not knowing that the very person carrying her burden is indeed that very same Muhammed.\n\nWhen they reached a certain point, the woman requested Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] to leave her. Before they departed, the woman enquired as to who he was. Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] out of modesty did not disclose his identity. The old woman insisted and then Rasulullah [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] replied, \"I am that very same Muhammed that the people are talking ill about\". Wonderstruck, this old woman fell to the feet of Nabi (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasalaam) and exclaimed, \"If you are that same Muhammed then certainly whatever the Qurayesh are saying is nothing but lies\". She returned with Nabi (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasalaam) to Mecca and accepted Islam.\n\nThere are many such incidents where people accepted Islam and Deen through the character of Nabi and the Sahaabah. Hereunder are the answers to your specific queries.\n\n1. Islam is a religion of equality. Islam does not advocate tribalism or culturalism. Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasalaam) on the farewell sermon on Hajj stated there is no virtue of an Arab over a non-Arab. Virtue is determined on Taqwa and Piety. Therefore there is no point disputing over the point whether Ismail (Alayhi Salaam) is a full Arab or half. Nevertheless, a child is attributed to the father even though he/she may be born in a foreign country.\n\n2. At the outset, it is important to clarify the term fundamentalists. In Islam, there is no such term. Does it mean one who follows Islam in totality? As Muslims, the Laws of Allah and the Sunnah of Rasulullah subjugate us. Islam provides a complete and comprehensive way of life. In numerous verses of the Quraan, we are encouraged to follow Deen in totality. As Muslims, we cannot practice those Laws that suit us and discard the others. Nevertheless, the Quraan is absolute and infallible. One cannot interpret the Quraan as he/she desires. There have been grave warnings for those who interpret the Quraan without having the necessary knowledge to do so. There is no modern taught to the Quraan. Those who claim a modern taught to the Quraan do so to suit their own whims and fancies.\n\n3. There are two types of revelation. A) Wahy Matloo ( Quraan) B) Wahy ghair Matloo (Hadith). It is our belief that whatever Nabi said is the truth. Allah states in the Quraan \"He (Nabi) does not talk out of his own accord, whatever he says is revelation that is revealed to him\". However, based on authenticity, there are different categories of Hadith the highest in authenticity being Tawatur. According to Shariah, whoever denies a Mutawatir Hadith leaves the fold of Islam.\n\n4. We are unable to comment on this until we do not have the clarify on the issue from the Muslims in Australia. Nevertheless, the world is filled with Muslim minority groups and communities. What would be so peculiar about Australia?\n\n5. One who does not testify in the Oneness of Allah and do not accept Muhammed as His final messenger is considered as a non-Muslim.\n\n6. Shariah does not encourage violence and wars against the non-Muslims. There are Laws and that rules govern engaging in war. War is the last option. According to Shariah, the Muslim army cannot simply go and attack the non-Muslims. Shariah emphasises that the army should first invite the non-Muslim to the Oneness of Allah and to accept Islam. If they refuse, then negotiate with them to pay tax to the Muslim Government and then if they refuse then only engage in war. Therefore, Shariah never encourages war. Those who have created the impression that Islam is a religion of violence and war has not displayed the true Islam. They have painted a fake picture of Islam that suits their needs and agenda.\n\n7. Refer attached\n\n8. The negative actions of certain individuals cannot have a negative impact of Islam. Islam does not breed terrorism nor does Islam encourage it. If a citizen of a country does some thing irresponsible, will the entire country be condemned because of his/her crime? Terrorists that operate do so in their individual capacity and not that of Islam encouraging them.\n\n9. As Muslims, we are bound to follow the laws and regulations in a non-Muslim country as long as it is not against Shariah. If a Muslim does anything against the laws of the country and Shariah, he should be reported to the relevant authorities.\n\n10. We have stated above that Islam in way promotes violence and war. Islam spread with kindness and character.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
