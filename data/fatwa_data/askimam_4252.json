  "question": "Do these acts break my salah and Q's on fasting?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nQ1) When I am praying salah, sometimes I have a bad habit of peeling the dry skin on my lip and then chewing it and sometimes eating it. Does this break my salah and what if I peel the skin and then chew it and spit it out. Does this still break my salah? Q2) When praying salah I need to scratch my self several times, does salah break if you move more then three times, and am I only allowed to use one hand for this purpose, if I use the other hand sometimes in the same prayer, does this break salah? What if I use both hands at the same time, will this break salah? Q3) Is it true that one can make intention to fast and still eat afterwards until the time of fajar or sehri ends (most assume that ones the intention is made, one can not eat)? And that one can make the intention upto midday if one did not eat after sehri ended? Q4) Is it true that one must make intention for qadah fast before sehri ends (start of fajar) and not afterwards?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. We assume that the piece of skin if very small, less than a sesame seed.\nHence, the Salaat will not break. But one should avoid it as far as humanly\npossible.\n2. The Salaat will break if, a) You use 2 hands at once, or, b) Use only one\nhand but more than 3 times in one posture, e.g. in the standing posture you\nstretched more than 3 times using one hand only.\n3. After making intention one can still eat until Subh Saadiq.\n4. Niyyah for Qadhaa fast must be made before Subh Saadiq.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
