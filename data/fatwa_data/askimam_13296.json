  "question": "What is a Mozu^o Hadith. What is the criteria of taking Mozu^o Ahadith",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is a Mozu^o Hadith. What is the criteria of taking Mozu^o Ahadith while narating the virtues. According to a Hadith, Allah recited Surah Yasin and Surah Taha one thousand years before He created the Heavens and the Earth, and on hearing this the angels said \"Blessing is for that Ummah unto whom the Qur'an will be sent, blessing is for the hearts\nwhich will bear it and blessing is for the tongues which will recite it\". This Hadith is considered a Mozu^o Hadith but it is written in various books of our pious Ullamah. I heard that Zaif Hadith can be taken for virtues but Mozu^o can't. Please correct me and enhance our knowledge about this issue.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to the principles of Hadith, a Hadith will be measured according to its Sanad (chain of narrators). The Muhadditheen have written extensively on the various narrators and their authenticity. If in the Sanad of the Hadith, there is a narrator who is accused of fabrication, the Hadith will be classified as Mawdhoo. It is not permissible to quote a Mawdhoo Hadith even for Fadaail (virtues). It is permissible to quote a Daeef Hadith (weak) for Fadaail on condition the Hadith is not very weak.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
