  "question": "What is the Islamic ruling on the recitation of the Maulud-an-Nabi?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nMany people repeatedly ask what is the Shar%E9e status of \"%C9id-e-Meelad-un-Nabee'. Moreover, What is the ruling of the Shari%E1h with regard to standing up in reverence and reciting Salaat and salaam during the customary Meelad proceedings?%0D%0A%0D%0AAnswer: The establishment of ceremonial gatherings under the banner of \"%C9id-un-Nabee\" is prohibited according to the Shari%E1h. Attaching importance and significance to such functions is purely Bid%E1h and an innovation in Deen, because neither did Rasulullah himself indulge in it, nor did the illustrious Khulafaa-e-Raashideen (Radhiyallaahu-%C1nhum) organise such functions. Similarly, neither did any of the other Sahaaba-e-Kiraam (Radhiyallaahu-%C1nhum) participate in such gatherings, nor is there any incident on record during the blessed era of the taabi'een or tab'e taabi'een (Rahmatullaahi %C1layhim) that can, in any way, substantiate this innovation. No proof whatsoever can be found, in spite of the fact that these were people who were best acquainted with the Sunnah of Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) and had total love for him. They were staunch followers of the Shari%E1h.%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) has in no unclear terms, said: - \"whoever introduces anything that is not part of Deen, into this Deen of ours, it shall be rejected.\" (Bukhari%2FMuslim)%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another Hadith he says: -%0D%0A\"Hold steadfast onto my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly-guided Khulafaa, after me. Hold steadfast onto it firmly, and beware of newly-introduced practices, for every new practice is an innovation and every innovation leads one astray.\" (Abu Dawood%2FTirmizi)%0D%0A%0D%0ASevere warnings have been sounded in the above-mentioned Ahaadith with regard to introducing and implementing innovations in Deen.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe holy Qur'an enjoins: -%0D%0A\"And whatsoever the messenger giveth you, take it. And whatsoever he forbiddeth, abstain (from it). And keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is stern in reprisal.\" (59:7)%0D%0A%0D%0A\"Verily in the messenger of Allah, ye have a good example for him who looketh unto Allah and the last day, and remembereth Allah much.\" (33:21)%0D%0A%0D%0A\"This day have I perfected your religion for you and completed my favour unto you, and have chosen for you a religion, al-Islam.\" (5:3)%0D%0A%0D%0AThere are numerous other Aayaat and Ahaadith that can be quoted. But from no Aayat or Ahaadith can the current form of \"Eid-e-Meelad-un-Nabee (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)', be proved. In spite of this, the people that revel in establishing and participating in such functions, and regard the same as a form of reward, insist on forging ahead with their carnal ideals. This attitude of theirs causes some serious questions to be posed: -%0D%0A%0D%0ADid Allah Ta'ala not perfect Deen-e-Islam for this Ummah?%0D%0ADid Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) not disclose to us all the facets and aspects of Islam that required being put into practice?%0D%0A%0D%0AThe bitter truth for the exponents of Bid'a is that it was only many centuries after the righteous and golden era of Islam that people began t0 fabricate innovations under the h00d of \"%C9id-e-Meelad-un-Nabee (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)\" and \"Mahfeel-e-Meelad\", which were, practices not ordained by Allah Ta%E3la to any of His Ambiyaa %C1layhimus salaam.%0D%0A%0D%0AWill such innovations grant proximity to Allah Ta%E3la? Never! On the contrary, these innovations should be a cause of great concern and alarm for the Ummat-e-Muslimah! Na-oothu-billahi-min-thalika! We seek Allah Ta%E3la's refuge from innovations that tantamount to levelling mind-boggling accusations against the pure and venerable personality of Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) by innovating such practices, one is indirectly suggesting that Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) concealed from the Ummah, aspects of Deen that were of immense benefit t0 it. How can this be possible when Allah Ta'ala himself categorically declares that he perfected this religion for us and completed his favour upon us, which means that Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) conveyed every single aspect of Deen to the Ummah and that he left no stone unturned in showing us every road leads t0 Jannah and every road that takes one to Jahannam so that we may adopt the former and avoid the latter.%0D%0A%0D%0AHence, it is mentioned in one Hadith: -%0D%0A\"It was the incumbent duty of every Nabee %C1layhis-salaam to guide his Ummah towards that which was beneficial for it and warn it against that which was detrimental for it.\" (Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is a known fact that Rasulullah is the most superior of all the Ambiyaa %C1laihimus-salaam and also that he is the seal of all the prophets %C1layhimus-salaam. He left no stone unturned in conveying Deen to us and rendering precious advice to us. If the \"%C9id-e-Meelad-un-Nabee (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)\" was a divinely inspired act, then surely Rasulullah would have commanded the Muslimeen to it, or at least, either he or his beloved Sahaaba (Radhiyallahu-%C1nhum) would have practised it. When it cannot be substantiated by any of their actions, then it is a crystal clear fact \"%C9id-e-Meelad-un-Nabee (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)\" or \"Mahfeel-e-Meelad\" (call it what you may), has absolutely no relationship with Islam instead, it is Bid%E1h (innovation) against which we have been soundly warned by Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) as was noted from the tw0 Ahaadith mentioned at the beginning of this discussion and, apart from them, many more can be quoted to prove the fallacy of innovation in Islam. That is why, in the light of these unambiguous proofs, the %DAlama-e-Haqq have always refuted and rejected the customary form of \"%C9id-e-Meelad-un-Nabee%B7(Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)\" and Mahfeel-e-Meelad and have also always discouraged people from participating in such gatherings.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf a careful and proper dissection of this \"%C9id-e-Meelad-un-Nabee (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)\" is made, it will be found that, apart from it being a manifestation of Bid'at, it also encompasses 0ther evils such as the intermingling of sexes, usage of musical instruments and many other such evils which wildly flaunted under the banner of \"%C9id-e-Meelad-un-Nabee (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)\" and under the deception that reward is being accrued. The most abhorring and shocking evils in these functions are the acts of shirk that take place. With hollow claims of \"Hubbe-Rasul (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)\" (love for Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)), entreaties and supplications are made to beings other than Allah, namely to Ambiyaa %C1laihimus-salaam and Auliaa-e-Kiraam Rahmatullaahi-%C1laaihum. The exponents of \"%C9id-e-Meelad-un-Nabee (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)\" also blindly acknowledge and believe that Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) comes to this function and due to this belief, they stand up in respect and veneration to welcome him. This belief is a blatant fabrication and a sign of compound ignorance. The true and down t0 earth fact is that Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) does not arrive at any \"%C9id-e-Meelad-un Nabee (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)\" function and that he is in his Rawdha-e-Mubarak (grave) at Madinah Munawwarah and will emerge from it at the onset of Yawmul-Qiyaamah. The following Aayaat and Hadith testify to this fact: -%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Qur'an, addressing Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam), announces explicitly: -%0D%0A\"Lo! Thou wilt die, and Lo! They will die. Then Lo! On the day of resurrecti0n, before your sustainer, you will dispute.\" (39:30,31)%0D%0A%0D%0AAt another juncture, Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) is addressed together with the rest of mankind: -%0D%0A\"Then Lo! After that ye surely die, then Lo! On the day of resurrection ye are raised (again)\" (23:16)%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) himself has said in a Hadith: -%0D%0A%0D%0A\"My grave will be the first to be opened on the day of Qiyaamah and I shall be the first person to intercede and the first person whose intercession shall be accepted.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above mentioned Aayaat and Hadith as well as other similar Aayaat and Ahaadith prove that all of mankind will be raised from their graves on the day of Qiyaamah, with Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) being no excepti0n. This is a belief that revolves around the consensus of opinion of the entire Ummat-e-Muslimah, hence the need for all Muslims to believe that Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) is in his Rawdha-e-Mubarak and does not frequent any \"%C9id-e-Meelad-un-Nabee (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)\" programme. All Muslims must be made aware of this so that unsuspecting ones do not fall prey to the Bid'at and innovations introduced into Deen by ignoramuses of this Ummah.%0D%0A%0D%0AWe make Du%E1a to Allah Ta'ala that he keeps us on the correct Deen-ul-Islam and that he gives guidance to those that goes astray.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta'ala's Durood and salaam descend upon Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Importance of Durood and Salaam%0D%0AInstead of squandering our money and time on futile acts 0f Bid%E1h let us rather utilise our precious time, as much as possible on the recitation of Durood and salaam upon our beloved Rasulullah, which is indeed, a highly meritorious and virtuous act. The Qur'an enjoins: -%0D%0A\"Lo! Allah and his Malaaikah shower blessings on the Nabee 0 ye who believe ask for the descent of blessings on him and salute him with a worthy salutation.\" (34:56)%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) has said: -%0D%0A\"Whosoever sends one Durood upon me, Allah Ta'ala will shower ten mercies upon him.\" (Muslim)%0D%0A%0D%0AParticularly on the day of Jumu%E1h one should increase the recitation of Durood and salaam.%0D%0A%0D%0AMay Allah Ta%E3la give us the guidance to recite Durood abundantly and grant us 'Hubbe-Rasul (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam)\" in the true sense of the word.%0D%0A%0D%0AWarning to %DAlama%0D%0AHadhrat Mu%E1dh bin Jabal (Radhiyallaahu %C1nhu) narrates the following Hadith, 'Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu %C1layhi Wasallam) said, 'whenever a Bid%E1h originates in my Ummah and the %DAlama do not prevent it, the la%E1nat of Allah, of his angels and of mankind descend upon them (the %DAlama who refrain from prohibiting the innovation).'
