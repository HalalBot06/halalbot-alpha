  "question": "Is Bait of any shariah Prson(Peer) is allowed?If allowed in which cirumstances?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nHazrat Sb! I have a every thing in my life but have shortage of sakoon-e-qalb and my soul is totally disturbed.Even then I try to offer five times prayers, my condition still same. Now I try to search shelter under the roof of Taswaf. For that purpose some shariah Person ask me to Bait Him. I will like to know is Bait is allowed in Islam and under which circumstances. I am really afraid off that God will keep me safe from Shirk.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe concept of Bai'at is expressly mentioned in the Quran and Hadith. There%0D%0Aare different categories of Bai'at. One is to express submission to the%0D%0Aleader of the Muslims, Ameerul Mo'mineen. This category of Bai'at is%0D%0Acompulsory. The other category of Bai'at is for Islaah (reformation). This%0D%0Acategory of Bai'at is not compulsory. If a person is able to reform himself%0D%0Aindependently without the assistance of a spiritual guide, then he may do%0D%0Aso. In such an instance, there is no need for Bai'at. However, generally, a%0D%0Aperson experiences difficulties in reforming himself and he requires the%0D%0Aassistance of an expert to assist him in the reformation process. In order%0D%0Ato achieve that, he takes Bai'at as an expression of determination and%0D%0Asubmission to obey. His spiritual guide then takes it upon himself to guide%0D%0Ahis Mureed and the Mureed undertakes to obey. Therefore the purpose of Bai'%0D%0Aat is at most an administrative matter to achieve maximum benefit and%0D%0Aresults. It is not Shirk. However, we advise, you should exercise caution in%0D%0Achoosing your Peer. Apart from him excelling in Taqwa, piety and having the%0D%0Aexpertise to reform, you too must be comfortable with him and his procedure.%0D%0AYou must be able to relate to him and be able to benefit. For that we%0D%0Apropose you first keep Islaahi relationship and qualify that with Bai'at%0D%0Alater only after you are satisfied. You may inform us who the person in%0D%0Areference is and we may be able to guide you in that.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
