He also has many properties. These properties are earning a rental income. The rental from one of his properties is used to run madressas which is part of his charitable fund.\n\nIn business A he uses an overdraft facility and loans from commercial banks for his cash flow, to run his bussiness, which he is paying intrest on. It has been suggested to him to sell bussiness b and some properties so that he will have enough money to run business a without paying intrest.he has had good offers for business b and his properties,however he is not interested. The problem of paying intrest has been explained to him but he does not want to listen.\n\nHe is also living in a home where he as a bond. He does have another apartment which is vacant, which he can sell to pay off his bond. He also refuses to do this. \n\nI and my sisters all live in homes provide by my father, which were purchsed on bonds. These homes have now been paid for.we also have a second property each purchased in the same manner. We also receive a monthly income from our father.\n\nAlhumdulilahallah (s.w.t) has given some understanding of deen and we are now concerned about our situation. Please could you answer the following qustions? \n\nQ1) can we live in these homes knowing intrest was paid on them.\n\nQ2) is the money that we receive every month halaal for un knowing that the business is being run on intrest.\n\nQ3) should he be going for haj and umrah every year and running madressas when he is paying intrest in his bussiness and living in a bonded property.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykumwa-rahmatullāhiwa-barakātuh.\n\nAlhamdolillah, Allah granted you understanding of Deen that interest is haram. Continue advising your father with respect and wisdom.\n\nThere are two issues here:\n\na.      To buy a house on bond or to run a business with interest and loan.\n\nb.     Ownership of the house.\n\nIt is haraam (strictly prohibited) to take an interest loan to purchase a house or to run a business.\n\nيَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَذَرُوا مَا بَقِيَ مِنَ الرِّبَا إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ (278) فَإِنْ لَمْ تَفْعَلُوا فَأْذَنُوا بِحَرْبٍ مِنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَإِنْ تُبْتُمْ فَلَكُمْ رُءُوسُ أَمْوَالِكُمْ لَا تَظْلِمُونَ وَلَا تُظْلَمُونَ (279) \n\n[2:279] O ye who believe! fear Allah and relinquish what remains of interest, if you are believers.\n\n[2:280] But if you do it not, then beware of war from Allah and His Messenger; and if you repent, then you shall have your original sums; thus you shall not wrong, nor shall you be wronged. \n\nعنابن مسعود ، قال : لعن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم آكل الرباوموكله وشاهديه وكاتبه\n\nRasulullahsalallahualayhi wasallam cursed the one who consumes Riba’ a,\nor gives it, or stands witness for it ormakes out the contractfor it.\n\nHowever, your father will be the owner of the house. If he gave you the house or any moneys as a gift, it will be valid as your father’s major source of income is from halaal.\n\nأهدى إلى رجل  شيا او اضافه إن كان غلب ماله من الحلال ، فلا باس به... (العالمكيرية ٥/٣٤٢)\n\nAlhamdolillah, your father can afford to gofor Hajj or Umrah every year. You shouldcontinue to making him understand that the noorhe will attain from his Hajj or Umrah (or any other Ibaadat) may get spoiled by dealing in interest. Therefore you have to advise your father to abstain from interest bearing loans.\n\nAnd Allah Ta’āla Knows Best\n\nMufti Mouhammad Yassine Ibn Ibrahim Ibn Ismael Panchbhaya,\nStudent Darul Iftaa,\nRe\n\nChecked and Approved by,\nMuftiEbrahim Desai.\nwww.daruliftaa.net"
