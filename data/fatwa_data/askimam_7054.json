  "question": "I know a woman who has become a muslim and I have been trying to teach her how to do salah. She has not learnt all of it yet but wanted to do her salah in English until she knows it in Arabic",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. I know a woman who has become a muslim and I have been trying to teach her how to do salah. She has not learnt all of it yet but wanted to do her salah in English until she knows it in Arabic. Is this allowed for her to do, or is there a different shorter salah that she can do until she has learnt all the essentials/wajib of salah at least. 2. What is the ruling on a woman who is pregnant but wants to seek a divorce from her husband who is not providing for her. Must she wait till she has had the child to do this? What are the rulings regarding iddah period in such a situation? 3. Is it permitted to give presents to kufaar as Eid presents or just generally as leaving presents (leaving work, university etc?).? Or does one have to have a particular intention for giving presents to kufaar? 4. Can we name a baby Saif Allah, and if not can you please explain why?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Until she learns the complete Salaat, she may say ?Allaahu Akbar? when starting the Salaat and say Subhaanallah thrice in every posture. She should also make an effort to learn the complete Salaat with Qiraat, etc. as quickly as possible.\n\n2. She is entitled to seek a divorce from her husband on grounds of failure to pay maintenance. If he issued a divorce whilst you was pregnant, her Iddah terminates when she gives birth.\n\n3. It is permissible to give presents to Kuffaar if the intentions is to win them over towards Islam.\n\n4. Yes, it is permissible. The spelling would be Saifullah ? one word.
