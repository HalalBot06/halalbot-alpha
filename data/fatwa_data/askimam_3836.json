  "question": "If a person dies but he has been paying his debts.But he still owes some, does he still go to jinnah or does he remain out intill there payed.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) emphasised the rights of a\ncreditor. He said, 'If a person has the means to pay but does not do so,\nthat is oppression.'\n\nRasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) also refused to perform Salaatul\nJanaaza on one Sahaabi (Radhiallaahu Anhu) who was in debt until another\nSahaabi took the responsibility upon himself to pay the debt.\n\nIn view of the aforegoing, one should avoid being involved in a debt.\nHowever, if he is involved in a debt, he should record that in his Wasiyyat\n(Will) and make provisions for the debt to be paid from his estate. In his\nlifetime, he should endervour to pay the debt out by making adjustments in\nhis comforts. If he did all the above and passes away without the debt being\nfulfilled, then Insha Allah, Allah will judge the person according to his\nintention.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
