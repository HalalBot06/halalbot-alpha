  "question": "I will be on the plane during Iftar time of Ramdan on 21st November. To break the fast by iftar, should I follow the local time of departing station or time of next station?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, the time for Iftaar (breaking fast) is sunset. You should make\nIftaar wherever you witness sunset, whether at the departing station or even\nwhile on the plane. The departing or arriving station is not a criteria for\nIftaar. The criteria is sunset.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
