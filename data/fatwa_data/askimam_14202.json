  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1)   when sumone is aroused due to any reason, but in his senses i mean while not being in sleep,then a white liquid comes out from the private part.......called mazi ..... now my question is .......at this situation .......offering the prayer is valid or not and what to do otherwise?\n\n2) while one is busy in washroom, some drops of water down from the flush fall onto the foot ...which is actually felt ......what to do in that case ......... droping some pure water on the feet would resolve the matter ...and prayer will b valid after that or what .?\n\n3) to find out whether the mazi is out or not , by touching the part private, is right or not ? \n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. When Mazi comes out from the private parts, the Wudhu will break, hence, Salaat will be invalid. One should wash one’s private parts and the area of Najaasat, i.e. the Mazi and make a new Wudhu. (Fataawa Hindiyyah vol.1 pg.12; Ilmiyah)\n\n2. The water in which Najaasat falls also becomes impure. Therefore, the drops of water that fall on one’s foot from the flush is impure and has to be washed until the impurity is removed. However, it is preferable to wash a minimum of three times.
