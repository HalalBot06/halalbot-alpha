  "question": "How to make a person who blashphemies, repent. Is his repentance acceptable?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf a relative has issued sentences such as he hates the tablighi jamaat or they are wrong. Or has made fun of the beard of some other Sunnah of Rasool Sal Allahu Wa alaihi wasallam, how to make him/her repent? Will their repentance become acceptable to Allah Jalle Jalaa luhu? What book can they read to help them understand. Should we break off relations with such relatives who even after explaining, continue to act against Islaam or even speak against certain commandments not of their liking? Please help guide with proper Islamic Mashwara and fatwa. What if I myself have spoken harshly with such relatives, how can I applogize. This harshness was due to their contiuous mocking of Sunnah or due to their hatred of Jamaat. I have appologized once for this harshness but what beyond that do I have to do? Salaam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Their action is despicable. Once they repent, Allah Ta'ala will accept\ntheir repentance as He is most forgiving.\n2. If you feel that severing relationship will remedy the situation, you may\ndo so. If on the other hand, you are confident that maintaining this\nrelationship with them would enable you to rectify their behaviour and\nbeliefs, continue a cordial relationship with this intention.\n3. Your harshness to them was justified since they had mocked the hallmarks\nof Islam. However, it is better if you apologize and maintain an amicable\nrelationship with them.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
