  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have got married 4 months before but after getting married I came to know that my husband does not believe in the authentication of Hadith, he says that the Hadith had got some change because of changing hands and authors and due to certain inqilabs, but he believes in Quran. And he also says his prayers in a different way (only TWO RAQAT OF FARAZ WITH ONE SAJDA AND HAVING DIFFERENT DUAS ONLY FROM QURAN). He also believes in some group called \" PERVAIZIAT\". So my question is that what should I do, should I continue marriage with him, or try to convince him, as I am pregnant of three months also, and I also dont know the future of my child, what way he/ she will follow in the context of Islam/religion?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf a person rejects the Ahaadith of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), especially Ahaadiths that are Mutawaatir (100% authentic), the Fuqahaa have termed him as a Kaafir. His Nikah is void. It is necessary for him to correct his beliefs and enter the fold of Islam again. If he lives with his ex-wife, it would be Zina. The children would follow the Muslim parent.
