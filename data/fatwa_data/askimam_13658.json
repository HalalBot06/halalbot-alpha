  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nMy father in- law passed away and left his estate without a will to his 4 daughters, one son and his wife. How will his total estate (cash and a house) be distributed. Also, due to my mother-in law living in the house, it was decided that one of the heirs, who is in a good finacial position would buy out the house and then distribute the cash to the other heirs. Would this be o.k?\n\nJazzakhAllah Ghair\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe estate will be divided into 48 equal shares and distributed as follows: Wife receives 6 shares, Each daughter receives 7 shares and Each son receives 14 shares.\n\nIf all the heirs agree for the one heir to purchase the house and pay the heirs their amounts according to their shares, then it will be permissible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
