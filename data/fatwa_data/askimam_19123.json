  "question": "Is vegetarian pork Halaal?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs vegetarian pork halāl?  It is 100% animal free and made from soya.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu ‘alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\n\nThe permissibility of a food product is based upon its content, not its name.  Hence, even though the name of the product is repugnant due to its containing the word “pork,” vegetarian pork is still permissible if it is completely free from any non-dhabīhah animal derived product. \n\n \n\nAnd Allāh knows best.\n\nMuftī Abrar Mirza\nChicago, IL (USA)\n\nUnder the Supervision of Muftī Ebrahim Desai (South Africa)\n\n \n\n_"
