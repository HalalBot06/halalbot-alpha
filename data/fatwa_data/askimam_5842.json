  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-u-alaikum Mufti Sahib Recently there has been a ridiculous e-mail going around. ---------------------------- Now days, there is a hot issue of \"WAR ON TERRORISM\" going around the world. It really started from the 11th September 2001, when the huge twins of WTC Towers crashed down. One real fact lies behind all this. As if you all know. The day was 11. The month was 9. The building contains 110 floors. Now, remember the figure. (11 - 9 - 110) Open the Holy Quran. In Paarah # 11, Surah # 9, Aayat # 110. It says clearly. \"THE BUILDING, WHICH THEY BUILT, WILL NEVER CEASE TO BE A MISGIVING IN THEIR HEARTS UNLESS THEIR HEARTS BE TORN TO PIECES. ALLAH IS KNOWER & WISE\". (Which means that no one must be accused for all ! that happened. ONLY ALLAH KNOWS) The Holy Quran briefs about all that going to happen more than 1400 years ago. Dear Brothers & Sisters, THIS MESSAGE IS FOR ALL HUMAN ON THIS EARTH. So, spread this message through but the world to let everybody know about the truth. The truth that Muslims are not Terrorists. The truth that Muslims does not like Terrorism. The truth that ISLAM does not teach us Terrorism. The truth that our religion ISLAM is a peaceful religion. Come let's pray for all Human on this Earth either alive or dead. May Almighty Allah forgive us all. AAMEEN. -------------- Please comment on this in depth\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to the books of Tafseer (commentaries) of the holy Qur'aan, the%0D%0AAayaat mentioned 11, 9, 110 refers to a specific incident which occurred%0D%0Aduring the time of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0AA person by the name of Abu Aamir Raahib had great animosity for Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and Muslims and had always fought in all the%0D%0Abattles against Islam. In the battle of Hunayn, when the tribe of Hawazin%0D%0Awas defeated, he lost hope and fled to the kingdom of Shaam. He continued in%0D%0Ahis effort against Islam until his death. He went to the king of Rome to%0D%0Aspur him to fight against the Muslims. In the meanwhile, he had written to%0D%0Athe hypocrites of Madinah that he is coming with Khaysar (king of Rome) to%0D%0Aattack Madinah, so you (hypocrites) must build a headquarter for them.%0D%0AThereafter, they had planned to build a house in the form of a Musjid - in%0D%0Aorder to deceive Muslims. The hypocrites planned to gather their weapons in%0D%0Athis so-called Musjid which will be used against the Muslims. Twelve%0D%0AMunaafiqeen then went to Quba which already had a Musjid to build another%0D%0A'Musjid'. They, then plotted to invite Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) to%0D%0Acome and pray in that Musjid in order to further deceive the Muslims. Nabi%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) was preparing for the battle of Tabuk and told%0D%0Athem he would come there on his return.%0D%0A%0D%0AUpon his return to Madinah, Allah Ta'ala revealed the plot of the%0D%0Ahypocrites. Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) commanded the Sahaaba%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhum) amongst whom were Aamir ibn Sakan and Wahshy to destroy%0D%0Athat 'Musjid'. (Ma'ariful Qur'aan vol.4 pg.465).%0D%0A%0D%0ATherefore, these Aayaats of the noble Qur'aan referred to an incident that%0D%0Aoccurred 1400 years ago during the time of Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam). The occurrence of September 11 are mere coincidences and have no%0D%0Asignificance and relation to the noble Qur'aan whatsoever. It is also%0D%0Apossible that these numerical order s be interpreted in other ways than the%0D%0Away explained above, then in that case what will be the response? E.g. one%0D%0Amay say instead of 11-9-110, 9-11-110.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
