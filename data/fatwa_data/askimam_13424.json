  "question": "after Maghrib salaat with Jamaat that they will read the Esha Salaat in Jamaat immediately - due to Rainy weather conditions. Is that right",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nRecently some salafi brothers Came up with a sahih hadith  - and informed us after Maghrib salaat with Jamaat that they will read the Esha Salaat  in Jamaat immediately - due to Rainy weather conditions. Is that right\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAccording to the Hanafi Madhab it is incorrect to combine two Farz Salaah in one time except on the occasion of Haj. Therefore, one cannot combine the Maghrib and Esha Salaah in Maghrib time even though there is a valid excuse.\n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
