Jazakallah khairun\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Salaat on behalf of another is not permitted. Yes, the reward from the Salaat may be conveyed to the deceased.\n\n2. Women are allowed to wear bangles.\n\n3. Nafl Salaat is an optional Salaat. There is tremendous reward in performing Nafl Salaat. Also, the shortfall or deficiency of the nature of one?s Fardh Salaat will be compensated for by Nafl Salaat.\n\n4. You may give your food to them. However, do not accept any cooked food from them due to the fear of Haraam contamination.\n\n5. Do not bother about such dreams. Focus on the reality of life instead.\n\n6. I am unaware of a website. However, there are a number of books available on this subject.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
