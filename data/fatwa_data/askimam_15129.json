He has to provide her shelter, food and clothing. The husband must have the financial means to fulfill his responsibility. If you are nineteen and you don’t have the financial means to support the woman you marry, how will you fulfill this obligation? Your parents are not obligated to support you and the woman you marry. In principal, if you cannot marry and you will be violating the rights of the woman you marry, then you should exercise restraint and control your desires by fasting.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
