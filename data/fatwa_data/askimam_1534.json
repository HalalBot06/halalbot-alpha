  "answer": "QUESTION\n.How do you pray salaatul Tasbeeh? most people pray this salat at the night of 15 sabaan. Thanx\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSALAAT AL-TASBEEH%0D%0A%0D%0AAmong the optional prayers, this prayer is given great eminence.%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that the Messenger of%0D%0AAllah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said to his uncle Abbas ibn Abdul%0D%0AMuttalib (Radhiallaahu Anhu), \"Shall I not give you a gift? Shall I grant%0D%0Ayou a blessing? Shall I inform you of a great benefit? Shall I give you%0D%0Asomething, which if you do, Allah will forgive you all your sins, old and%0D%0Apast and new, committed by mistake or knowingly, small and big, committed in%0D%0Asecret or openly? What you have to do is offer four rak'ah of optional%0D%0Aprayers in this way: in every rak'ah after the Al-Hamd and Surah and while%0D%0Ayet standing, recite the third kalimah fifteen times, then in the bowing,%0D%0Aruku, ten times, then standing up after the bow, qoma, ten times, then in%0D%0Aeach prostration ten times and in between the two prostrations ten times,%0D%0Aand sitting up after the second prostration, ten times; seventy-five times%0D%0Aper rak'ah, three-hundred times in all.%0D%0A%0D%0AThen, He said, \"If possible, offer this prayer once every day; if you%0D%0Acannot, offer it once on Fridays, if this is not possible, offer it once a%0D%0Amonth, if this too is not possible, offer it once a year, and if even this%0D%0Ais not possible, offer it once in your lifetime.\" (Ibn Maja, Tirmizi, Abu%0D%0ADaud)%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Abbas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) used to offer this prayer every Friday and%0D%0AAbu Jauzan Ta-i used to come to the mosque every day as soon as the azan for%0D%0Athe noon prayers was called and would offer it by the time the Jamaat stood%0D%0Aup for the obligatory prayers. Hazrat Abdul Aziz bin abi Radad held that he%0D%0Awho wanted paradise should hold on firmly to Salaa-al-Tasbeeh. According to%0D%0AAbu Usman Teri, \"There is nothing better than Salaat-al-Tasbeeh to keep away%0D%0Atroubles and sorrow.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Niyyah: 'My Niyyah is four rak'aat of Salaat-al-Tasbeeh for Allaah%0D%0ATa'ala, facing the Qiblah'.%0D%0A%0D%0APropositions regarding Salaat-al-tasbih -%0D%0A%0D%0A1. No specific Surah is prescribed; according to some Ahadees, there should%0D%0Abe at least twenty Verses.%0D%0A2. The counting should not be done orally (because this would disturb the%0D%0Aprayer) but by pressing one of the fingers, wherever it may be.%0D%0A3. If the recital is forgotten, the count should be made up in the next%0D%0Apart, but never in between prostrations or during the qoma, not after the%0D%0Afirst and third rak'ah, but after the second or fourth rak'ah.%0D%0A%0D%0ABenefit -%0D%0A* This prayer may be offered any time except when a prayer is Makrooh.%0D%0A* It is better to offer it after the sun begins to decline.%0D%0A* After the word, 'Subhaanallah Wal hamdulillah Wa laa ilaaha illallaahu%0D%0AAllaahu Akbar,' the words, 'Walaa hawla walaa quwwata illaa billaahil%0D%0Aaliyyil adheem' should be added. This is according to some tradition. It%0D%0Awill be better to add these words also, 'Subhaanallah wal hamdulillah walaa%0D%0Ailaaha illallaahu wallaahu akbar walaa hawla walaa quwwata illaa billaahil%0D%0Aaliyyil adheem.'%0D%0A* The words should be recited in the second and fourth rak'ah before%0D%0Aal-Tahiyaat, and during the bow (Ruku) and prostration (Sajda), the words%0D%0A'Subhaana Rabbiyal azim' and 'Subhaana Rabbiyal A'ala' respectively should%0D%0Abe recited first and then the kalimaat.%0D%0A* Another way is to recite the words fifteen times after Subhan but before%0D%0AAl-Hamd. The ten times after Al-Hamd and a Surah. The rest as stated above.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf the latter procedure is followed, there will be no need to recite the%0D%0Akalimat after the first and third rak'ah nor before al Tahiyyaat in the%0D%0Afourth, (because the seventy-five times will have been completed at the end%0D%0Aof the second prostrations of every rak'ah).%0D%0A%0D%0AProposition -%0D%0AIf, for any reason, the need arises for a sahw prostration (an extra%0D%0Aprostration required after concluding the prayers because of forgetting),%0D%0Athe kalimaat should not be recited in it, but if the count is missed......%0D%0Athe kalimaat may be recited in it.%0D%0A%0D%0AMufeedul Muslimeen%0D%0AMufti Ismail Kachholvi Saheb, UK"
