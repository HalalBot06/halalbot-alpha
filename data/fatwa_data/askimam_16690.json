It is not permissible for men to wear any type of ornaments or jewelry besides a silver ring. The weight of the ring must not exceed 4.373 g.  It will be sunna for a ruler, judge, or an official to use a ring as a seal.  For others, it will be merely mubah (permissible).\n\nAl-Fatawa al-Hindiyya (5:335) Maktaba Rashidiyya\n\nRad al-Muhtar (6/358) Sa’eed\n\n\n.... <Not a Complete Fatwa.
