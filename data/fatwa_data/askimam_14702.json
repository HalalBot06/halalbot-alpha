Is it allowed\n\nfor us to do this? Because our Ruksati is not performed yet so we are planning to do it secretly\n\nwith proper precautions. Is it Haram in Islam to do sex before Ruksati if we both are agree on this?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu\n\n \n\nAt the outset, it is important that you and your wife talk to the seniors of the family and request them to settle you down as quickly as possible. It is possible the seniors do not know your condition and are delaying in the rukhsati.\n\n \n\nIt is important to maintain Adab (etiquette) and Haya (modesty) even with ones wife. Hayaa is part of Imaan and must be observed at all times. Although it is permissible to talk to your wife in that way, you should always remember that Allah is watching and listening to you.\nAccording to Shariah, once the Nikah is performed, you are considered to be husband and wife. You may conduct yourself with your wife as a normal husband with do. However, in some communities, until rukhsat not is taken, it is common understanding that the husband will not have physical relation with the girl. If the girl is prepared to wave this right, it is permissible.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\nA SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MUFTI EBRAHIM DESAI\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the world was in darkness of inhumanity, Allah Taala gave knowledge and guidance to Rasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).\nThe guidance through that Divine knowledge had changed the mindset of people and transformed the evil practices of people to the highest morals.\nEducation and knowledge of Divine guidance is the backbone and foundation of reformation, prosperity and peace.\nIslam provides guidance and solution for every aspect of life. Ignorance of such knowledge leads one to look down upon Islam and suffer an inferiority complex.\nWhen one studies Islam, the Quran and Hadith, then only one will value the in-depth wisdom in such knowledge.\nMuslims are generally ignorant about Islam and that is the fundamental cause of our decline and retrogression.\nWe have to educate ourselves on Islam and rise to the challenges of the times and once again prove ourselves as a dynamic Ummah. For that sacrifice, take out time to study Islam from reliable Ulama and scholars.\nIf you cannot make your son an Aalim of Deen then encourage others to become Huffaz and Ulama. You will get the reward of the person studying and guiding people through his knowledge.\nIf that too is difficult, at least help and assist a person who wishes to study Deen.\nRasulullah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “When a person passes away all his deeds terminate except three, Sadaqah e Jaariyya (perpetual reward), pious child that makes Dua for the parents and knowledge through which others benefit”.\n\n \n\nSEE OUR ALINAAM WEBSITE FOR HOW TO ENROLL AT OUT INSTITUTE- www.alinaam.org.za"
