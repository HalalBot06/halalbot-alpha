However, this Hadeeth refers to that person who has written an agreement or prepared the document to evidence the actual transaction.\n\nعن جابر قال لعن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم آكل الربا وموكله وكاتبه وشاهديه وقال هم سواء. (رواه مسلم)\n\nHazrath Jabir (Radhiyallahu Anhu) narrates that Nabi (Sallahu ‘Alaihi Wasallam) cursed those who are involved in usury; whether it is the person who is giving usury, receiving it, writing the transaction or witnessing it.\n\n \n\n(Sahih Muslim Vol.11 Pg.28 – Dar al-Ma’rifah)\n\n\nThe commentators of Hadith explain that whilst the abovementioned narration explicitly forbids one from writing the transactions of interest, it does not include those people or accountants who record these transactions later and were not involved in the transaction itself.\n\nوهذا إنما يقع على من واطأ صاحب الربا عليه فأما من كتبه أو شهد القصة ليشهد بها على ما هي عليه ليعمل فيها بالحق فهذا جميل القصد لا يدخل في الوعيد المذكور وإنما يدخل فيه من أعان صاحب الربا بكتابته وشهادته\n\n(Fath al-Bari (Ibn Hajr) Vol.4 Pg.394 – Qadeemi Kutub Khana)\n\n(Contemporary Fatawa (Mufti Taqi Usmani) Pg.160 – Idara-e-Islamiyat)\n\n \n\nHowever, an accountant or auditor who records these interest bearing transactions as an event that has already happened, and is not directly involved in these transactions, does not directly fall within the ambit of the warning of the abovementioned Hadith.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalamu Alaikum\n\nMl.
