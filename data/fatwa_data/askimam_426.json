  "question": "Sufism - Kindly elaborate on the issue of 'Feelings' and what negativeaspects they can have on Sufism.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn Sulook (walking the path of Sufism), a Saalik (person walking the path%0D%0Aof Sufism) experiences two feelings: a) Bast, b) Qabz%0D%0A%0D%0ABast is an Arabic word literally meaning 'expansion'. In the terminology of%0D%0ASufism, it refers to the positive feeling in the heart to perform abundant%0D%0AIbaadat, Tilaawaat, Dhikr, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0AQabz is also an Arabic word literally meaning 'contraction'. In the%0D%0Aterminology of Sufism, it refers to the negative feeling in the heart to%0D%0Aperform any or abundant Ibaadat, Tilaawat, Dhikr, etc.%0D%0A%0D%0ABast is desired as it assists in attaining the purpose of Ibaadat. However,%0D%0Ait is not purposeful itself as the positive feeling is not the object of%0D%0Aworship. Regarding the desired feeling as purposeful can be detrimental%0D%0Aespecially when one loses or decreases the condition of Bast. Regarding the%0D%0ABast as only a means of abundant worship, upon the feeling being decreased%0D%0Aor even suppressed, one will place the purpose ahead of his%2Fherself and%0D%0Acontinue with the Ibaadat, Tilaawat, etc. albeit without positive feelings.%0D%0A%0D%0AQabz is not desired as one feels negative and empty within the heart.%0D%0AHowever, it is not Mazmoom (bad) either. Since we do not worship feelings,%0D%0Awe should concentrate on accomplishing what is purposeful, Ibaadat,%0D%0ATilaawaat, etc. According to the Mutasawwifeen (Sufis), since the condition%0D%0Aof Qabz requires one to make more sacrifice in accomplishing his%2Fher%0D%0Aresponsibility, the rewards are greater. Furthermore, in Bast there is a%0D%0Apossibility of Iejaab (ostentatiousness) which is condemned. In Qabz, due to%0D%0Athe humility and humbleness one attains close proximity to Allah which is%0D%0Athe ultimate aim and objective.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe above is a very brief explanation of an extremely extensive subject%0D%0Awhich can be understood easily by undertaking the journey of Sulook.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta%E3la Knows Best.%0D%0A%0D%0AWas salaam%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0A%0D%0A"
