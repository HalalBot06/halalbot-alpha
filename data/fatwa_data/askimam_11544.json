  "question": "My mother died and i want her grave make marble/bricks.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n1. I am asking this question because there is a stream passing beside the graveyard. I have a fear that this stream may be flooded. My mother grave is near to that stream and it can damage the grave. So that is why I want to make my mother grave with marble or bricks. Is it allowed or not. 2. If we cook something say Fatiha on it and then eat ourselves or give it to some poor people. Is it allowed?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. It is not permissible to build over graves. However, if you really fear that the stream will be flooded, you may build walls around it. It is not permissible to make the grave from marble/bricks.\n\n2. To distribute food for Isaal-e-Sawaab of your late mother is an act of virtue. However, to say Faatiha on the food is an act of Bid?at (innovation).\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
