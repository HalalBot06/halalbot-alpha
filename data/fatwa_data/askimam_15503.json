  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs it permissible to give charity or dig a well with the intention of reward for all those that one has wronged whether alive or deceased?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIsaal-e-Thawaab (to perform a virtuous act and grant the reward to any person, alive or deceased) is permissible and in fact (Mustahabb) meritorious.\n\nأن الإنسان له أن يجعل ثواب عمله لغيره صلاة أو صوما أو صدقة أو غيرها عند أهل السنة والجماعة\n\n( قوله أو غيرها ) كتلاوة القرآن والأذكار\n\n(Fathul Qadeer Vol.3 Pg.65 – Maktabah Rasheediyah)\n\nHowever, this will not compensate for the wrong done to that person. The wrong done to that person can be forgiven only if that person forgives you, or if the money is returned, in case of monitory loss. As far as the deceased are concerned, one could make dua and istighfar for them, and hope for forgiveness from Allah Ta’ala.\n\nAapke Masail aur Unka Hal Vol.8 Pg.168 – Maktabah Ludhyanwi\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. M. Jawed Iqbal,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
