  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI want so badly to convert t Islam, but I am not sure where to start. I thought that mabey the best way to make sure that this is what I really wanted would be to follow Rammadan in October. Would I be doing wrong, since I am not yet Muslim. Is ther anything that I could go for guidance where I can go for guidance? Thank you...\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIslam is about correct beliefs and practice. If you already believe in the Oneness of Allah, the greatness of all Prophets and that Prophet Muhammad is the final prophet, you are already a Muslim.\n\nHowever, the month of Ramadhaan is close by and that should give you an ideal opportunity to start practicing on Islam. You should contact the local Muslim organization in your area and request to officially pronounce your Islam. If you have any difficulty, feel free to contact me and I will assist you. It is important to know where you are from.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
