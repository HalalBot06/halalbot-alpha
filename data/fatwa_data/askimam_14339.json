  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. What is your opinion of the books Milestones and in the shade of the quran by shaheed Sayid Qutb.\n\n2. According to you what could be the reasons that Imam Ghazali had written about everything but not Jihad.\n\n3. Whenever one of our relatives dies, we go to there house and we do dua, is this a sunnah or a biddah.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. I have not read the above books. Sayyid Qutb belonged to the Ikhwaanul Muslimeen.\n\n2. Imaam al-Ghazali [ra] has written on Jihaad also in his book al-Waseet fil Madhab (vol.6)\n\n3. It is preferable to offer one’s condolences to the deceased family. The religion of Islam is very easy to follow. One can make du’aa or send Isaal-e-Thawaab to the deceased from wherever he is. It is not necessary to go to the funeral house for du’aa, as an integral part of Deen and the one who does not do so is a transgressor, then this action (going to the deceased house for du’aa) will be categorised as a Bid’ah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
