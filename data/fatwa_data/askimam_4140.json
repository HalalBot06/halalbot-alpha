  "question": "Salam, Muslims and I need advice...",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam, What should I do if a Muslim boy he is 16, he knows how to say the Kalima but he does not want to say the Kalima because he feels ashamed of our Muslim way of praying and the Kalimas? And I need some advice because I am Muslim and religious but sometimes when i see kaffirs then i get angry and i want to kill them because they are immature and all and some of them in other city(Boston) they hit a Muslim girl and Muslims and Blacks had a fight twice and Muslims won but it is not fair how they treat us Muslims, so what should I do i can't calm myself of hating the kaffirs... Thank you\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1)We do not understand the details of your first question. Kindly Rephrase.\n2) Allah Taala describes some qualities of his pious servants. Among them,\none is when the ignorant speak to them they say salaam (avoid them with\nwisdom and diplomacy). We advise you apply wisdom and do not re-act to any\nstatement made by non-muslims. We should rather display good character and\nhumility.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
