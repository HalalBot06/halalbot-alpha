  "question": "I am a bit confused as to why Muslims cannot use (give/get) interest.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nLiving in a non-muslim country, it is almost impossible not to deal with interest. Such banks are non-existent. Also how can one buy a house or a car without the issue of interest? Not everyone has that much money to pay things off and no friend or relative assists with that much cash. What are you supposed to do in this case? Islamic foundations such as ISNA say that they will help pay your house, but they take money from people too, it's under a different title, but it's the same thing as interest. So what are we to do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTHE REALITY OF INTEREST AND ITS MODERN INTERPRETATIONS%0D%0A%0D%0AThe history of the prohibition of Interest%0D%0AIn the Torah (Old Testament) where intoxicants, fornication and the%0D%0Aconsumption of pork are declared unlawful interest is also prohibited. This%0D%0Abears testimony to the fact that Interest was unlawful and prohibited during%0D%0Athe time of the Banu Israaeel (Children of Israel). But the Jews in their%0D%0Aegoism and transgression revolted against this divine law with such%0D%0Aintensity that they became proverbial USURERS and INTEREST EATERS. During%0D%0Athe time of the Zaboor, a group condemned for their transgression.%0D%0A%0D%0A'Those of the children of Israel who went astray were cursed by the tongue%0D%0Aof Dawood and of Eesa, son of Maryam. That was because they rebelled and%0D%0Aused to transgress.' (Sura 7 v. 78)%0D%0A%0D%0AThis accursed nation was continuously afflicted with punishments and%0D%0Acalamities even upto the present day. Their empires and kingdoms were%0D%0Arepeatedly overthrown and they wandered from door-to-door. This was in%0D%0Areality the consequences of their insatiable evil deed to consume interest%0D%0Aand their insanity, through which they had murdered their own messengers and%0D%0Aprophets (Alayhimus salaam), falsely accused them and rejected their%0D%0Amiracles. When the Christian empire was established, one Jew deluded%0D%0AChristians by proclaiming that Jesus was the son of God, thereby distorting%0D%0Athe reality of Christianity.%0D%0A%0D%0ADuring the era of the Christian invasion of Europe, practically every lawful%0D%0Athing was declared unlawful. Interest devouring has reached its peak, such a%0D%0Alevel especially after the two world wars. That practically the entire%0D%0Aworld's economy evolves around this most destructive system.%0D%0A%0D%0ARIBA OR INTEREST%0D%0AInterest in the Holy Qur'an is referred to as 'Riba'. Riba is derived from%0D%0Athe word, 'Ribwun' which literally means 'increase'. This outward increase,%0D%0Ain reality, is a loss. Allah most High sanctions in the Noble Qur'an:%0D%0A%0D%0A'Allah has blighted Usury and made almsgiving fruitful'%0D%0A%0D%0AThis verse explicitly explains the reality of Interest and its result.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn the above verse, the word 'Yurbi' is used in its literal meaning which%0D%0Ameans increase and the word 'Riba' is used in its figurative meaning: that%0D%0Aexcess in a transaction, against which there is no value.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf the above meanings are not observed, the correct translation of this%0D%0Averse will not be possible. This verse informs us that the apparent (outer)%0D%0Aincrease in Interest is in reality decrease and loss and the apparent%0D%0A(outer) decrease in charity is in reality expansion and increase.%0D%0A%0D%0AINTEREST IS HARAAM (IN ITS NATURE AND SUBSTANCE)%0D%0AAllah most High has made unlawful for the believers all types and forms of%0D%0Ainterest because interest in its nature and essence is Haraam and the%0D%0Aprohibiting factor is also found in it i.e. decreasing and abolishing. These%0D%0Atwo realities i.e. prohibition and decreasing are original qualities of the%0D%0Avery nature of interest and because the original properties can never be%0D%0Aabandoned. From it, no portion of interest can be free from these two%0D%0Aqualities. Consequently, each and every part of interest is forbidden and%0D%0AHaraam.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe conclusion that little interest and single interest is lawful proves%0D%0Atotal ignorance of the reality of interest or is based upon false%0D%0Aimputations.%0D%0A%0D%0AMR SABSWARI'S MISCONCEPTION%0D%0AMr Sabswari has termed the Alif laam on the word Al riba in the verse 'Allah%0D%0Apermitted trading and forbiddeth usury' as an indication to a particular%0D%0Atype of interest, not all types of interest. He terms that particular type%0D%0Aof interest, as compound interest. He claims that this verse forbids only%0D%0Acompound interest and not all interests. He further tries to substantiate%0D%0Athis by using Imaam Razi's statement that the Alif laam on the word Riba is%0D%0Asimilar to the Alif laam on the word 'bay' which really means that the%0D%0Apermission granted to trading in the said verse refers to a particular type%0D%0Aof trade. What particular trade is meant in this verse? It is evident that%0D%0Athis view of Mr Sabswari is incorrect. In reality, the word alif laam in%0D%0Aboth the words Riba and Bay' (Trade) are general and refer to all types of%0D%0Atrade and interest. Unfortunately, Mr Sabswari who is not a theologian,%0D%0Awrongly substantiated his view with the words of Imaam Razi (and could not%0D%0Aunderstand these words from Imaam Razi RA).%0D%0A%0D%0AThe verse prohibiting Interest is not Muskil (an Aayat which does not give a%0D%0Adefinite meaning and requires some interpretation to understand it) nor it%0D%0Ais Mushtabeeh (an Aayat bearing more than one meaning and requires something%0D%0Ato determine which meaning is meant) nor is it obliterated (Mahsooq) by the%0D%0AAhaadith that it can be refuted or rejected.'%0D%0A%0D%0AQaadhi Thanaullah mentions in his commentary of the Noble Qur'an, Tafseer%0D%0AMazhari that trade in this verse means all types of trade that are not%0D%0AMakrooh (disliked) Baatil (incorrect) and Faasid (corrupt). He also accepts%0D%0Athat trade is opposite to interest. That proves that the alif laam on the%0D%0Awords Trade and Interest are general and include all forms and types. Then%0D%0Aonly will trade and interest be termed as opposites i.e. all types of trade%0D%0Aare permissible and all types of interest are prohibited.%0D%0A%0D%0ADR FAZLUR RAHMAAN'S MISCONCEPTION%0D%0ADr Fazlur Rahmaan has also failed to understand the verse, 'O Ye Who believe%0D%0Adevour not usury doubling and quadripling'. He mentions that the words%0D%0A'quadripling' are linked with the command 'Devour not'. He has stated that%0D%0Aonly compound Interest is prohibited not simple interest. Interest is of two%0D%0Atypes - one permissible the other unlawful.%0D%0A%0D%0AThis division is totally against the terminology of the Noble Qur'an. The%0D%0Aclarifications of the the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the%0D%0Aviews of the learned Ulama of Fiqh.%0D%0A%0D%0AAll the commentators of the Noble Qur'an, the narrators of Hadith and the%0D%0AJurists have unanimously declared interest as Haraam, and have based their%0D%0Aclaims on relevant facts. They say that the words 'doubling and quadripling'%0D%0Aare merely emphasising this system of interest. The prohibition is alredy%0D%0Aderived from the words 'devour not'.%0D%0A%0D%0AQaadhi Thanaullah (RA) mentions that the words 'doubling and quadripling'%0D%0Aare mentioned as a rebuke and reproach not for abstinence from this%0D%0Aparticular form of interest because all forms are prohibited.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Noble Qur'an explicitly prohibits all forms and types of interest in the%0D%0Afollowing verse, 'O You who believe! Observe your duty to Allah, and give up%0D%0Awhat remaineth (due to you) from usury. If you are (in truth) believers'%0D%0A(Baqarah 278).%0D%0A%0D%0AThis verse prohibits the remains of interest. The word Maa is general and%0D%0Aincludes all forms and types of interest thus resulting in the total%0D%0Aprohibition of all interest. However, it is permissible to collect the%0D%0Aprinciple amount invested but whatever is over and above that, will be%0D%0Ainterest and is totally prohibited even if it is equal to a gram of silver%0D%0Aor merely one Dirham. It will all be in 'what remained from usury'.%0D%0ASimilarly simple interest, interest that has been doubled or any other form%0D%0Awill be included in the verse 'what remained from usury' which has been%0D%0Aprohibited. The classification of interest as simple interest and compound%0D%0Ainterest is incorrect. All forms are prohibited, therefore, the commentators%0D%0Aof the Noble Qur'an like Imaam Razi (RA), Imaam Abu Mas'ood (RA) have termed%0D%0Ainterest as absolutely unlawful and Haraam and they totally reject such%0D%0Amisconceptions as compound interest is Haraam and simple interest is lawful.%0D%0A%0D%0ABesides these clear verses of the Noble Qur'an, the Ahaadith also very%0D%0Aexplicitly state that interest is entirely forbidden. Hadhrat Abdullah bin%0D%0AHanzala (RA) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said,%0D%0A'One Dirhma of interest, whosoever devours intentionally is worse than%0D%0Athirty six fornications.' (Abur-Razzack, Tibri)%0D%0A%0D%0AThe modern interpreters who have classified Interest into simple and%0D%0Acompound interest are asked, 'One Dirham is interest or not?' If they termed%0D%0Ait as interest, all their interpretations are invalidated. If they do not%0D%0Aterm it interest, they have openly rejected the Hadith and falsified the%0D%0AHoly Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).%0D%0A%0D%0AHowever, this Hadith makes apparent that though fornication is a major sin%0D%0Aand completely against the conduct of Islam, interest eating is much worse,%0D%0Aimmaterial how little it is, even if it is equals to just one Dirham.%0D%0A%0D%0AFurthermore, the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) mentioned in his%0D%0Asermon at the farewell pilgrimage (the last sermon). 'EVERY BLOOD OF%0D%0AIGNORANCE IS TRAMPLED UNDER MY FEET AND EVERY INTEREST IS TRAMPLED UNDER MY%0D%0AFEET'.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE WORD 'Riba' is an indefinite noun which has a general meaning i.e. every%0D%0Akind of interest is abolished. This is exactly what is meant by the verse%0D%0A'Allah permiteth trading and forbiddeth usury'.%0D%0AThe effort to legalise interest today is not a new one. The Noble Qur'an%0D%0Abears testimony that this was present even in the time of our Holy Prophet%0D%0A(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). The Noble Qur'an states: 'That is because%0D%0Athey say trade is like usury'. (Baqarah 275)%0D%0A%0D%0ATheir initial claim was 'usury is like trade' but they deliberately reversed%0D%0Athe sentence to strengthen their claim. Their object was as follows: trading%0D%0Ais generally accepted to be lawful. Loss and gain (profit) is permitted in%0D%0Atrade. Interest is similar to trade. Therefore, why is profit and gain not%0D%0Apermitted in interest?%0D%0A%0D%0AAllah, most High exposes these distorts of this truth by quoting their own%0D%0Awords and replying to them that they are destined for punishment for their%0D%0Adistorted claims.%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE PROPAGATION OF INTEREST OR THE LEGISLATION OF INTEREST%0D%0AThe legalisation of interest will have detrimental results and effects on%0D%0Athe entire society. Basically, the poor sink deeper into poverty and the%0D%0Awealthy hold a monopoly over the wealth. Divine power does not allow this%0D%0Amonopoly for long, and eventually the poor will take revenge on the rich by%0D%0Ameans of what is termed today as a revolution. Therefore, Islam has totally%0D%0Aand strictly forbidden interest and the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi%0D%0AWasallam) preached its evil consequences in detail and practically%0D%0Aeradicated it from his society. After him the Khalifas and Imaams of Islamic%0D%0Alaws termed it absolutely Haraam without an atom of doubt.%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhu) says, 'Eradicate all doubt the matter%0D%0A(Aayat) is conclusive and decisive.'%0D%0A%0D%0ATHE WARNING TO THOSE WHO EARN AND DEVOUR INTEREST%0D%0AHow severe is this warning in the Noble Qur'an against interest!%0D%0A'Those who swallow usury cannot rise up save as he ariseth whom the Devil%0D%0Ahas portrayed by (his) touch' (Baqarah 275)%0D%0A%0D%0AHadhrat Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiallaahu Anhu) while reporting the incident%0D%0Aof Me'raaj has quoted many narrators who report that Hadhrat Ibn Abbaas%0D%0A(Radhiallaahu Anhuma) used to mention in the commentary of the%0D%0Aabovementioned Aayat that their getting up from the graves in this state and%0D%0Abeing unable to stand will be a sign of the interest-eaters. They will be%0D%0Arecognised by these very signs.%0D%0A%0D%0ATabraani reports on the authority of Hadhrat Auf bin Maalik (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhu) that they will be crazy, insane and mad. Imaam Muslim (Radhiallaahu%0D%0AAnhu) reports on the authority of Hadhrath ibn Mas'ood (Radhiallaahu Anhu)%0D%0Aand Imaam Bukhari (RA) reports on the authority of Hadhrat Abu Juhayfa (RA)%0D%0Athat the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) has cursed both the%0D%0Agiver and taker of interest.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe following verse is more threatening:%0D%0A'As for him who returned (to usury) such are rightful owners of the fire.%0D%0AThey will abide therein.' (Baqarah 275)%0D%0A%0D%0AFinally, the most severest punishment, declared in the Qur'an, is mentioned%0D%0Afor those who do not abstain from interest.%0D%0A%0D%0AAND IF YOU DO NOT, THEN BE WARNED OF WAR (AGAINST YOU) FROM ALLAH AND HIS%0D%0AMESSENGER (Baqarah 279)%0D%0A%0D%0AThis announcement will remain in force till the day of Judgement for those%0D%0Awho engage in interest bearing deals.%0D%0A%0D%0ABy Moulana Haroon Abbaasomar%0D%0A"
