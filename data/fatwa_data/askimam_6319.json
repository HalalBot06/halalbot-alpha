  "question": "I want my friend who is Shia to convert to Ahl al Sunnah.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI have a friend who strongly believes in her shia beliefs. After reading your article that shia's are not Muslims, I want her to convert to sunnah. But HOW? I don't want to force her but instead tell her things politely with evidences. I need your help. What can I say to her that will make her think that being sunnah is the right chose/faith for her. What questions can I ask her about her faith & beliefs that will make her speechless? Please advice what else can I do to make her believe! Can you recommend any strong evidences for me to prove to her and does anywhere in the Quran say that Shia's have chosen the wrong path. And are there any sources i can turn to for for knowledge?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not advisable for you to engage in any type of 'polite debate' with\nyour friend as this might create confusion due to a lack of knowledge. It is\nbest that you ask your friend to read some book.\n\nThere is an excellent journal published from Cape Town known as al-Istiqama.\nThis will Insha Allah prove to your friend the truth of the way of the Ahl\nal-Sunna. They may be contacted at c/o www.ansar.org email:\nmt_k@hotmail.com\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
