  "question": "Is it compulsory for kids (boys) under 5YR to don the ihraam for Umrah ?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy feeling is that it is NOT compulsory since the kids will not be 'performing Umrah' as such. They will merely be walking with us. They do not understand the rites of Umrah. They will be accompanying us for Umrah since there is no-one to care for them at home. One is aged 14 months and the other 5 years.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not necessary for the young boys to don the Ihraam.\n\nIt is, however, Mustahabb to do so.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
