  "question": "some one told me that to make niyyah before Salaat is wrong",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nsome one told me that to make niyyah beforeÂ Salaat is wrong. Can you please give me that hadith in where the prophet did it\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nNiyyah (intention) is actually from the heart. It is not necessary to make a verbal intention before performing Salaat. However, if a person is in doubt and the verbal intention helps one to strengthen the intention in the heart, then one may make verbal intention before Salaat.\n\nOne should not regard verbal intention as necessary and a precondition for the validity of Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
