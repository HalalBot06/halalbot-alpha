  "question": "Does one need to change their name upon conversion?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI a chose to marry a male who is a convert, does he need to change his first and last name or can he keep his original names? His last name will be taken by me, so does it have to be an Islamic name, if yes, can it be any Islamic name? Another molvi told me that his name could be anything as long as it doesn't mean an animal, is this correct? Jazakallah\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nRespected Brother-in-Islam%0D%0A%0D%0AAssalaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakaatuhu%0D%0A%0D%0AKindly refer below our standard reply to similar questions.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0A1.

There is no prohibition for a female to maintain her maiden name or adopt%0D%0Aher husband's surname after marriage. She may comply with the law of the%0D%0Aland in order to save herself from legal problems.%0D%0A4. The Urf and meaning of the word will be taken into consideration in%0D%0Adetermining the permissibility of keeping names for males and females.%0D%0A5.
