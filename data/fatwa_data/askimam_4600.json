  "question": "My wife made a mannat (Vow) without asking me (her husband) about naming a newborn.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nShe made a mannat that if boy born she will name him \"Mohammed Abdullah\". However fathers Parents wanted to name newborn (son ) something else. What should she do now?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nConsidering that she has already taken a vow, you should not be too hard. We\nare sure that she had good intentions in doing so. Try to explain to your\nparents that she has already taken a vow, and it is not good to break one's\nvow.\n\nHowever, in future, the wife should be careful. She should not make such a\nvow without first consulting with her husband. By not consulting, she has\ncaused her husband undue distress. The name, 'Muhammad Abdullah' is a very\ngood name, which will, Insha Allah, have a good effect on both the child and\nthe parents. Therefore, do not be too hard by insisting on another name.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMoulana Imraan Vawda\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
