  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nwhat is rule of wife,s motherÂ  can you come out front of her?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe son-in-law is a mahram to his mother-in-law. There is no purdah (hijab) to be observed between them\n\nThe mother-in-law can come in front of the son-in-law without observing the laws of hijab. However, both, mother-in-law and son-in-law should observe modesty and shame between themselves.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n\nWassalam\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
