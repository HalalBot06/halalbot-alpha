  "question": "(a) What's the difference between \"The Noble Qu'ran\" and \"The Holy Qu'ran\"?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n(a) What's the difference between \"The Noble Qu'ran\" and \"The Holy Qu'ran\"?\n\n(b) I am having a situation where as I want to get married but there is one thing stopping me. It is my cousin but, that's not the problem. Allah (swt) has only rewarded three people from my family with Al-Islam and I'm afraid of what the outcome may be if we do decide to get married. I keep telling myself and my cousin that we should fear Allah (swt) and not our family but that is hard to do. Don't get me wrong I fear Allah (swt) more than anything but we live in America were that type of action is considered to be looked apon as taboo, even among the muslims because is is rarely done. What are we suppose to do about this situation? May Allah reward you in the Hereafter!\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n1. Allah refers to the Qur’aan as ‘Karim’. Therefore, out of respect, the Qur’aan is known as ‘al-Qur’aanul Kareem’. Some have translated he word ‘Karim’ as ‘Holy’ and some as ‘noble’. However, the word ‘noble’ is a more accurate translation of the word ‘Karim’.\n\n2. We, unfortunately, do not understand what is your query in the second question. Kindly furnish more details.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
