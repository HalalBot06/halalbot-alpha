  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nDear Imam Alhamdolillah, I currently support my family (9 members) for their day to day expenditures. My father has debts which unfortunately he cannot pay. Can I pay my zakat to pay his debts if the money is not directly handled by him and goes to creditors.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nZakah can only be given to the recipients of zakah. Thus, if the creditors are eligible of zakah and you give them the money with the intention of zakah, zakah will be discharged although they may consider it to be the payment of your father’s account.\n\n \n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum\n\n \n\nMl. Abduz Zaman,\nStudent Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nConcurred by: Ml. Abdur Rahman Shareef, Student Dārul Iftā\n\n \n\nUnder the guidance of:\n\n\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai Saheb\nDārul Iftā"
