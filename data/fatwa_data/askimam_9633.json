  "question": "Does Islam encourage logical thinking? to open a website that logically explains the teachings of Islam so that people who dont have faith in Allah may be able to accept the practices of Islam",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI was just wondering whether Islam encourages logical thinking or not. I mean i want to open a website that logically explains the teachings of Islam so that people who dont have faith in Allah may be able to accept the practices of Islam.Also tell me whether a not-so-learned person like me can venture to explain these teachings in terms of pure logic. I dont mean the complexities but just the fat facts like not drinking, good manners, no illegal sexual intercourse, etc. Thank you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYes, Islam does encourage logical reason but within the boundaries defined by the Shari?ah. May we remind you that the intellect of man is limited and as such, he will not always be able to comprehend the wisdom of divine law. Sometimes, man is unable to understand the logics of Shari?ah law.\n\nHe is obliged to accept it whether it appeals to his intellect or not. We suggest you stick to the basic teachings of Islam without delving into the intricate subjects.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
