  "question": "JAAHILS OPPOSE ULAMA",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nJAAHILS OPPOSE ULAMA\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nJAAHILS OPPOSE ULAMA\n\n \n\nIf the article below is correct, then it is unfortunate and a bad reflection on the elders of Dewsbury Markaz. All the Ulama and respected people  should condemn such an attitude of non-Ulama who purport to represent Shariah through mere association of the Markaz. Non-Ulama should never interfere with the rulings and guidance of Ulama. The unanimous ruling of the Ulama in Batley and well supported by the general Ulama of UK, should be seen as a positive breakthrough for the Muslims of UK, and an opportunity for unity and adhering to Shariah. The interference of Jaahils should be condemned and stopped. The Markaz should distance itself from such Jaahils and protect the integrity of the noble work of Da’wah and Tabligh. The muslim public should express their concern to the elders of the Markaz.\n\n \n\n-Mufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\nRu'yat e Hilal and Tablighi Jam'aat\n\n \n\nAfter the good news coming out from Batley, where the Ulama Ruled on and truth after much effort, to follow the correct Sunnah method, it is with great regret and disappointment that I have to write that those who previously advocated following the Sunnah and the way of the Sahaabah, and who also advocated that the \"Ulama are the inheritors of the Ambiya\", and the laymen must follow them, namely the Tablighi JAMAA'AAT, ARE TODAY coming out openly in condemning the decision of the respected Ulama, and are trying their best to over turn the Batley decision.\n\nThese ELDERS meaning the members of their shuraa, which does not consist of even one AALIM, are behind the opposition of this revived SUNNAH. This is the same Jamaat that has as its Usool laid down by the founder, the Great Aalim Hadhrat Moulana Ilyas RA , that this Jama'aat of laymen will not interfere in the Masaail, that is the work and responsibility of the Ulama e Kiram. today the condition is such that the  whole Shuraa goes to the influential people in the Masjid trust telling them to disregard the ruling of the Ulamaa, if this happens this would be a sad day for the Ummah. As we should be aware that if one wants to destroy the Deen and the Imaan of the Ummah, History has showed us that this will be done by creating a veil between the laymen and the Ulama. It is a pity that this role of creating a veil is being carried out by a group who claim to be propagating the truth and forbidding wrong and sin. A great pity that they have reversed their role and now forbidding acts of Sunnah (may Allah protect us) Aameen. This is the same Tablighi Jamaat that used to say that this is a Mas'alah for the Ulama, not for the public, it seems that now this Shuraa has relegated the Ulama to position of laymen and promoted themselves to the position of the Ulama.\n\nI personally think that to go against the likes of Hadhrat Moulana Abdur Rauf Saheb DB, Hadhrat Moulana Sulaiman Bodiyat Saheb, Mufti Musa Badat Saheb, Mufti Yusuf Sacha Saheb and Moulana Yusuf Mama Saheb is indeed a grave mistake, and if these people (Shuraa of Dewsbury Markaz) who want to Abandon the correct Sunnah, prevail, it would be calling on the wrath and anger of Allah Almighty to hit the community. A fatwa of Mufti Ebrahim Desai which is on the askimam website, comes to my mind, it states: \"It is Fardh upon the Ulama and senior people to correct the open wrong of following Saudi announcement of the lunar month. It is disturbing to note that responsible people of the Tablighi Jamaat are thwarting the efforts of Ulama e Haq on Nahi Anil Munkar (stopping the wrong). This attitude has been one of the two biggest concerns of Hazrat Maulana Ilyas Saheb (R.A) before his death. He expressed his concerns to Hazrat Mufti Shafi Saheb (R.A) that when non Ulema lead this effort and non-Ulama are given prominent positions in Tabligh, they will lead the people astray. (Taqrir Tirmidhi Vol 5).\n\nIn the discussion of the imbalances of Tabligh Jamaat, in the above quoted reference, Hazrat Mufti Taqi Uthmani Saheb Madda Zillohu states that:\n\nThe ignorant people engaged in this effort become Muftis and also issue Fatwas. If responsible people of Tabligh Jamaat conduct themselves in a irresponsible manner as explained by yourself, then that is a complete disservice to Deen. The elders of the Markaz who are non-Ulama are engaged in “Fatawa” which is beyond their jurisdiction and ability. That is extremely dangerous for the ummat. One can understand the consequence of following the Fatwas of ignorant people and becoming an obstacle in propagating Haqq and stop wrong. They cannot claim being characterized by Amr bil Maroof and Nahi anil Munkar which is the salient feature of the noble work of da’wah and tableegh\".\n\n\"Hazrath Moulana Inamul-Hasan Saheb (RA), the former Ameer of Tabligh has categorically emphasized that an effort should be made to follow the correct criteria of moon-sighting. His letters have been widely circulated and could be seen on the website. It is the responsibility of every Muslim of UK, Ulama, Trustees of the Masaajid Organizations and masses to be firm on Haq and not to compromise on this. Following Saudi is a Munkar and an open wrong\".\n\nFurther this all seems to be politics played at the highest level, as this opposition from Markaz is only due to their open Enmity with Moulana Yaqub Saheb Qasmi DB. They are ready to forsake the haq and truth for their own worldly gains, there is not an element of Shariah behind the thinking of these Shuraa members. Do they really want us to follow the Jamiat? Whose Aqaaid are opposite the Aqaaid of the Akaabir Ulama of Deoband as they do not believe that our great Prophet PBUH is alive in his grave? The Holy Qur'aan mentioning the qualities of the Believers States\" The believers men and women, they are 'Auliyaa' of one another, they enjoin good and forbid evil..\" Al Towbah V 71\n\nRegarding the Munafiqoon, the Qur'aan states in the same surah verse no 67: \"The hypocrites, men and women, they enjoin Al Munkar, (sins Disobedience) and forbid from doing good\"\n\nWhat road are these supposedly Daa'ees taking? The path of the Al mu'minoon or the path Al Munafiqoon?  By encouraging people to forsake the opinion of Deobandi Ulama of great calibre, and follow a group of Misguided Mamaatees (elders of Jamiat ul Ulama Britain). By encouraging the people to forsake the Fardh Alal kifaayah of local sighting, and telling the people to follow a precalculated calendar, these people I am afraid are going astray and leading other people astray. It would be devastating to see those who were at the fore front of the Tablighi Jama'at from the early days to fall in the trap of Shaitaan the accursed, may Allah protect us and them. Aameen.\n\nMy message to my fellow Ulama is very simple, it is now time to stay firm, our Deen does not allow us to follow the Shariat of any other individual other than the Shariat of Muhammad Rasoolullah PBUH, hence we must come out and openly condemn those who are preaching wrong, remembering the fact that respect and humiliation is in the hands of Allah alone, hence there is no need to fear no one. As for the laymen, I strongly advise that you remain steadfast and follow the Ulama e Haq, who have an Aqeedah conforming to Akaabir Ulame Deoband.\n\nMay Allah guide us and give Hidayah to anyone who strays away from the truth Aameen."
