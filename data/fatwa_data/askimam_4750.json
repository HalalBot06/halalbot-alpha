  "question": "Is this true?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen tears come out from your eyes during namaz or reciting quran, where ever the tear touches, does that part become unlawful to the flame of hellfire? Example, if i cry during worship and rub my tears all over my face, will my face be unlawful to the flame?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe have not come across any express Hadith that the fire of hell becomes\nunlawful on those parts of the body touched by tears. However, in one\nHadith, Nabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said, 'The\nfire of Jahannum is unlawful on that person who cries out of the fear of\nAllah Ta'ala.' (Tirmidhi vol.2 pg.57)\n\nFrom such Ahaadith we understand that the tears that flow out due to the\nfear of Allah Ta'ala has a great effect in extinguishing the flames of\nJahannum.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
