  "question": "Can my bad dreams be a warning from allah, or are they just tricks from saitan",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWell for about one year and six months I have been getting these dreams were I?m getting attacked in a violent manner, at random times of the months. And at times I get saved and sometimes I don't. And the odd thing is whenever I get these dreams something bad would happen to my fianc√© who lives in a different country from me. This has happened so many times that I lost count. I read allot of surahs and duas to prevent these dreams, but that doesn't really work. Last week I had 3 dreams again and than 4 days later his mother past away. I know u shouldn't get bad meanings out of dreams and u should always be positive about it, but I have a really bad feeling in me, do my dreams mean something or is this all by chance? Are they a warning for something for me? plz give me some Islamic explanation for all this and plz give me advice how to deal with this.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAll your dreams have no significance.\n\nThey are Shaytaani dreams. You should ignore them. When you see such dreams\nand wake up, spit lightly in that direction and recite, 'Laa hawla walaa\nquwwata illaa billaah .'\n\nChange your direction and sleep. This advice was given by Rasulullah\n(Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) to a Sahaabi (Radhiallaahu Anhu) who used to\nget evil dreams.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
