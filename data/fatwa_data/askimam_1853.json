  "question": "In regards to question number 188 - 'Can a Sunni man can marry a Shia girl?' The answer was no.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nCould you please state the area in the quraan or hadith clarifying this? Thank you.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is not permissible for a Muslim male to marry a non-Muslim female. The\nruling excludes marrying a female from the Ahle-kitaab (Christians and\nJews). Kindly refer to marriage to the Ahle-kitaab on this site.\nThe beliefs of the shias are inconsistent with the fundamental beliefs of\nthe Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaa'ah, therefore they are not Muslims. Kindly refer\nto the beliefs of the shias on this site .\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best.\n\nMufti E. Desai"
