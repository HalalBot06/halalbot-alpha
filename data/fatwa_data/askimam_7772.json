  "question": "What is the punishment for a person who causes a husband and wife to argue and fight?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhat is the punishment for a person who causes a husband and wife to argue and fight? My sisters in law always tell my husband bad things about me that are not true and he believes them. What does Allah say about this?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe case put before us is of a very serious nature. Other people getting involved in other peoples affairs for the sake of causing problems is seen by Allah as worst than one committing murder. But for this to happen one needs to realise if the other party is giving information to safeguard and inform one party then it cannot be viewed in the same light. If what you say is the reality of the situation then Allah states in the Quraan \" fithnah is worst than murder...\"\n\nMay Allah guide us all. Ameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nShaykh Irshad Amod\nAL-FALAAH COLLEGE\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
