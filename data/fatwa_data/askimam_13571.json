  "answer": "QUESTION\nPlease explain the hadith where Prophet (saw) says that he has been ordered to fight against those who disbelieve in Allah and his prophet and the Last Day. I am not sure how the hadith goes but it is something like this and there is also a quran ayat like this I think so please kindly explain it(Jazakallah)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThe Aayaat of the Qur’aan and Ahaadith explaining the command of fighting the disbelievers are many. Allah Ta’ala states, ‘Fight against those who, a) Believe not in Allah, b) Nor in the last day, c) Nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), d) And those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the scripture (Jews and Christians) until they pay Jizyah with willing submission and feel themselves subdued.’ (Surah 9 Aayat)\n\nIn another Aayat, ‘And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism, i.e. worshipping others besides Allah) and the religion (worship) will all be for Allah Alone (in the whole of the world). But if they cease (worshipping others besides Allah), then certainly Allah is All-Seer of what they do.’ (Surah Anfal Aayat 39)\n\nThe command of fighting the Kuffar is until Kufr diminishes and Islam becomes dominant. However, this is only applicable to the people of Makkah and the Arabs. This is due to the fact that Jazeeratul Arab (Arab peninsula) is the house of Islam. And no other religion should remain there except Islam. (Ma’ariful Qur’aan vol.4 pg.232)\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
