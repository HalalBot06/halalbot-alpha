  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nWhat is the majority opinion of Ulama about this du'a :\"Allahumma inni 'abduk ibn 'abdik ibnu amatik nasiyati bi yadik madin fiya hukmuk 'adlun fiya qada'uk as'aluka bikulli ismin huwa lak...\"\n\nIt's the du'a for sadness and anxiety we can find in the book \"hisnul muslim\".\n\n1). Is this du'a authentic ?\n\n2). And if it is not can we still use it ?\n\nSomeone said there's a doubt about it's authenticity. But personnally I heard this du'a so many times by several scholars. I've tried to search the topic and found out there's a problem with one narrotor in the chain but Al albani for example said it was authentic. And also i know that in some cases a da'if hadith can be used. But i don't have the ability and 'ilm to decide so i would like the opinion of majority of ulama.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nThe Dua in reference is a Hadith and is reported by Muhadditheen such as; Ibnu Hibban, Hakim, Ahmad, Abu Ya’la, Bazzar,Tabrani and Ibnu Abi Shaybah رحمهم الله تعالى. Hafiz Ibn Hajar has stated that this Hadith is Hasan. He further says that according to some scholars this hadith is Sahih. Hakim has also affirm to it being Sahih and Ibn Hibban has reported it in Sahih Ibnu Hibban.\n\nThere is no problem in practicing upon the mentioned Hadith as Imam Nawawi also mentions it in his famous kitab “Al-Azkar”.\n\n(Al-Futuhat Al-Rabbaniyyah. Vol.2.Pg.13. Dar Al-Fikr)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl. Safraz Mohammed,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
