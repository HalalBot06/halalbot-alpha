  "question": "1.If one is sitting for Itikaf is he allowed to attend a Janaza (Fard) in the musjid, if not why and specify ref. 2. In Itikaf is one allowed to bath if he feels uncomfortable?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIf one is sitting in Nafl (voluntary) I?etikaaf, he may leave the Musjid specifically to attend a Janaaza or take a bath. If he is sitting in Sunnat I?etikaaf, for example, in the last ten days of Ramadhaan, he cannot leave the Musjid to specifically attend a Janaaza or take a bath.\n\nHe may do so subordinately, for example, when going to relieve himself, on the way, he may attend a Janaaza if the Janaaza is about to be performed or take a shower if the bathroom is empty.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
