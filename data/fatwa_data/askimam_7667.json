  "answer": "QUESTION\n.The appearance of Allah written in arabic in fruits /fishes /clouds ./stars a sign from Allah for people of weak faith to strengthen their Iman ...does it bear any message for the people of the house in which such a miracle has occured ? 3.By sinning in this life will people have to account in this life too by the sins been compensated by failure at workplace or in life ?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. Sayyiduna Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-Aas (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ?Whoever passes away on Friday will be saved from the punishment of the grave.? (Musnad Ahmad vol.2 pg.220; Hadith7050, 6646). Similar narrations have been reported by Sayyiduna Jaabir ibn Abdullah (Radhiallaahu Anhu) (refer Hilyatul Awliyaa vol.3 pg.181), Sayyiduna Anas ibn Maalik (refer Abu Ya?alaa, Majmauz-zawaaid vol.2 pg.319) and others. This Hadith has been classified as authentic by some Ulama. However, the exact meaning of this Hadith is unclear. It could mean that only for that day of Friday is the punishment uplifted and it could mean that he would be saved totally. (Fataawa Mahmoodiyah vol.6 pg.62) As for one passing away in Ramadhan, it could be possible because Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) mentioned in a Hadith that in Ramadhaan, the doors of Jahannum are closed and the door of Jannat are opened. (Sahih Bukhari Hadith3277; also refer Fataawa Mahmoodiyah vol.6 pg.63)%0D%0A%0D%0A2. The appearance of the name of Allah in these objects is a lesson for one and all. Even those who are strong in faith, increase in strength by this. so, it depends on the condition of the Imaan of that household.%0D%0A%0D%0A3. This could happen so as to remind man of the fact that Almighty Allah knows his deeds and is able to punish him. Hence, man shall take lesson for this and stop sinning. Allah Ta?ala says, ?Mischief has appeared on land and sea because of that which the hands of men have earned so that Allah may give them a taste of some of their deeds in order that they may turn back.?
