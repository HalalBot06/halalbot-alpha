  "question": "Can a women wear her pyjames and perform salaah?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nOn radio Islam the moulana said you are not allowed to wear pyjames anf perform salaah cause you are standing before allah and because a women would never leave the house wearing a pyjama.I readmy fajr salaah with my pyjama as well as esha because i feel comfortable in it. Please advise me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is Makrooh to perform Salaat in casual clothes that are worn around the home and in which one would feel ashamed to venture outdoors.\n\nSince Pyjamas fall under this category, it is Makrooh to perform Salaat in Pyjamas. We suggest you put on a cloak over your pyjamas and then perform your Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
