  "question": "I m working in a Newspaper called Gulfnews in Dubai which involves printing/publishing of newspapers & magazines. 2ndly I want to know abt HSBC AMANAH. They r offering Shariah Financial Solutions.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI m frm Pakistan, working in Dubai 2 support my father,mother(both patients) & a younger brother(studying).I m working in a newspaper dat involves printing of pictures. Mostly these pictures r unethical, immoral & vulgar (of actresses, models etc). My primary responsibilities include providing of paper 2 the press for printing thru material requests & maintaining the consumptions per publication per day electronically. Now under these circumstances where I m the supporting pillar of my family & that family does not hv inclination towards Deen and its vast aspects & conditions, pls. explain is it permissible to work for the same company as I believe I am involved somehow in a sin of printing photographs. But please do remember that whatever you state will be understood by me but will be very difficult to let my family understand the same. Secondly HSBC AMANAH is providing Shariah Financial Solutions; Personal Finance being a part of it. I want to complete my Postgraduate Degree from University of Wollongong in Dubai. Now can I take study loan from HSBC AMANAH and pay back the amount on monthly basis from my company?s paid salary (as I think this income is not JAIZ because of printing of photographs)? Website: www.hsbcamanah.com. Its Shariah Supervisory Committee includes Justice (Retd) Muhammed Taqi Usmani, Shaykh Nizam Yaquby, Dr. Mohamed Ali Elgari & Dr. Muhammad Imran Ashraf Usmani as mentioned on the website. Please explain and guide me vis a vis my issues in detail.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYour income from the Newspaper company will be permissible for you.\n\nWhile working for the company, try to keep yourself away from the direct involvement on the printing of immoral pictures. You could also use the income to repay your loan to HSBC Amanah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
