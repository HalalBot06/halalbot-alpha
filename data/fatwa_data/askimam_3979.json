  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy brother has been chatting to a woman over the internet on a pure Islamic wish to find a suitable woman to marry.I wish to know if this is permittable and if it is, what is the extent that they can go to.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nKindly refer below our standard reply to similar queries.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A%0D%0AThere are two fundamental aspects in choosing a marriage partner, a) The%0D%0Aoutward appearance, b) The ideology and character of the person.%0D%0A%0D%0AGenerally, as well as naturally, the outward appearance of a person is given%0D%0Aprominence before considering the ideology and character of the person.%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) also encouraged the boy and girl to%0D%0Asee one another for the purpose of marriage. (Mishkaat). It is, therefore,%0D%0Aadvisable to first choose one's prospective marriage partner and thereafter%0D%0Aenquire about his%2Fher ideology and character through avenues permissible in%0D%0AShari'ah, for example, friends, associates and family members. Shari'ah also%0D%0Aemphasizes one making Mashwara (consult) and make Istikhaara (seek Divine%0D%0AGuidance) before deciding. How much can one achieve by talking to the boy or%0D%0Agirl directly to determine his%2Fher character and ideology?%0D%0A%0D%0ASurely, the boy and girl will be as impressive as possible to pass the test.%0D%0AThat is not the normal conduct of the person which will be expressed in his%0D%0Aday to day life. There are many negative factors, if the procedure is%0D%0Areversed, and prominence is given to communicating with the person, to%0D%0Adetermine his character and ideology.%0D%0Aa) Can the person you are chatting with be trusted? There are many incidents%0D%0Aof chatting in the context of marriage but have led to illicit and immoral%0D%0Arelationships. Many people, especially, women have been misled and abused.%0D%0Ab) If the boy and girl consider themselves compatible in ideology and%0D%0Acharacter but disapprove one another's outward appearance, that will lead to%0D%0Agrief and agony as the communication was in the context of marriage. The%0D%0Amomentum has been built and now it's against the expectations of one or both%0D%0Aparties.%0D%0A%0D%0ALife is too dear to tread on unwarranted risk and thin ice. One should%0D%0Aexercise precaution in every aspect of life."
