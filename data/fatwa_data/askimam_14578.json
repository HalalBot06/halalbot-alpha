  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAssalamwalaikum,\n\nI am great need of advise. For the last twelve months I have been suffering in one form or another. For the first time in my life I started masturbating at the age of 25. At the time I was engaged but living in a western country where, for all the years I have lived here, have been able to protect my self from the gravest of sins. After finally pushing my parents I was able to get engaged but I knew that my tolerance was at its limit. I started masturbated in the holy month of Ramadan last year and I feel greatly repentant for that. It was then that I lost a very good job then when Allah (SWT) granted me another in a couple of days, I forgot his favour and started doing it again. In two weeks I tried hard to resist and be as best a muslim as possible but I was diagnosed with an illness in my ears which forced me to lose my job and really suffer since I couldn't sleep at all because of this. I still have this problem and kept praying to Allah (SWT) for months I prayed and prayed but not much changed and I resorted to masturbating again in disappointment and dispair. Due to some circumstances which are not in my control I cannot get married right now. But now a new problem has afflicted me I have constant headaches along with the problem in my ears, believe me, when I say that I am in great suffering and since I live alone it is even more difficult. I know that my afflictions are owing to my own sins but I keep asking Allah (SWT) for forgiveness and help I keep praying and now again in this holy month I am suffering I had hoped that this month would change everything for me but if anything I am in even more pain. I used to miss Salaats before but now try my utmost to offer five time prayer daily and pray profusely to Allah (SWT) but no salvation seems to be coming. I know HE (SWT) is listening but I dont know what else to do for him to respond I feel like HE (SWT) is so angry with me that Allah (SWT) will not respond.\n\nAny Dua or help will be appreciated\n\n \n\nJazakAllah for your help\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\n Brother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\n As the outset, it is of paramount importance that you understand that Allah created us and sent us to this world to test us. For that we will face many conditions. Our reactions should be one of patience and perseverance. In that condition do what Allah wills us to do. If you are facing another difficulty within an existing difficulty don’t despair and resort to anything un- Islamic. That will not help you. You will feel guilty and uncomfortable and attribute the test to your wrong doings. If you exercise patience, and still experience more problems then you could safely attribute that as a test from Allah. That is a means for your status to be raised by Allah. The adversities are a blessing in disguise. Don’t despair yourself by reacting in the wrong way. Be patient, perform your five daily Salah, recite some Quran daily and take out time and go in isolation, make the Zikr of Allah and make Dua to Allah. Be strong and focus on Allah. Be happy with whatever Allah decrees for you\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
