  "question": "What is a Sufi? Is Sufism right?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nSufism is a process of spiritual upliftment. It is a way of reforming\noneself and attaining closeness to Allah Ta'ala. Spiritual upliftment,\nreformation and attaining closeness to Allah are orders replete in the Qur'\naan.\n\nIf it is possible for any individual to reform himself, he should do so. However, it is generally noticed that individuals experience difficulties in\nreforming themselves and seek assistance of a spiritual guide who is pious and adhere to Shari'ah in reforming themselves. The practise of taking\nallegiance (Bay'at) and following the guidance of one's spiritual mentor is called Sufism.\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
