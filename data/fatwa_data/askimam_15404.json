  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIs this allowed to have some \"general chat\"(no love talks) between engaged couple on SMS only?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\n \n\nIt is Haraam (prohibited) to have any general chat with a stranger even though the communication is not of an intimate nature. Couples which are engaged are not considered as husband and wife until the Nikah is performed. Therefore they too cannot have any communication until after the Nikah. Any communication with a stranger will be Zina of the tongue, ears, mind and heart.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\n \n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
