  "answer": "QUESTION\n1)Recently I heard that it is permissable to wear a 100% silk tie because the tie is not worn like a shirt is worn? Since it is not part of the shirt it is okay to wear a 100% silk tie. What is the reasoning behind prohibition of wearing a silk tie?\n2) Are we allowed to wear a tie which has less than 50% silk? For example if its 30% silk and 70% polyster?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nI am unaware of such a ruling issued by anyone.\n\nNonetheless, a tie is not the dress of the Muslims and we should abstain from wearing ties â€“ silk or otherwise.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED & APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Fatwa Dept.)"
