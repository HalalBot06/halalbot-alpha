  "answer": "QUESTION\nSir, I am in a deep spiritual relationship with my cousin and we talk over the phone, being so far from each other(I am in Australia and she is in Pakistan. My parents don't permit me to do so. Can I still marry her on my own according to Islam.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAccording to Shari'ah, an adult (boy and girl) reserve the right to marry a\npartner of his/her choice. However, due to marriage being a major step in\none's life, it is advisable to make Mashwara (consult) with your seniors as\nwell as make Istikhaara (seek divine guidance). Somewhere on this site,\nsearch 'Istikhaara' (without quotes).\n\nYou should also consider the advise of your parents as it is motivated by their love and concern for you.\n\nAnd Allah Ta√£la Knows Best.\n\nWas salaam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
