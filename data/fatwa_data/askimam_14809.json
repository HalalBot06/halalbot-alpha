The sacrificing of an animal on Eidul-Adha is compulsory upon every adult Muslim who possesses an excess of at least the minimum Nisaab on the Subah Saadiq (break of dawn) of the 10th of Zil-Haj (Eid day).\n\n\n2. If you have a debt on your head and no surplus money equivalent to the minimum Zakaatable amount, then it is not compulsory upon you to sacrifice an animal.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
