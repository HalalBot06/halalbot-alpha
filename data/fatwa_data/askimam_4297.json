  "question": "Will any Jews go to Jannah, as they believe that there is one God?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAccording to Imaam Abu Hanifa, people must at least believe in the oneness of Allah Ta'ala. Insha Allah, that will be sufficient for their salvation.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Taala says in the Quran, 'Verily (the accepted) religion in the sight\nof Allah is Islam'. In another verse, He says, 'And whosoever follows (and\nreligion) besides Islam, it will not be accepted'. The Shariah that was\ngiven to the Jews through Musa (Alayhis Salaam) was confined to that time.\nIt was abrogated when Easa (Alayhis Salaam) was appointed as the prophet of\nAllah. The Jews were required to submit to the Shariah (way) given to Easa\n(Alayhis Salaam) which was finally abrogated by the Shariah given to\nRasulullah.\n\nThe salvation of every person depends upon submitting to the religion of\nIslam according to the Shariah of Rasulullah. Merely believing in the\nOneness of Allah is not sufficient. The opinion of Imam Abu Hanifa is for\npeople who did not get the message of Islam.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
