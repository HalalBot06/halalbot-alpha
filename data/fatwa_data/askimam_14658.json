  "answer": "QUESTION\nAslam-u-Alyqum\n\nI would like to thank you for providing such a worhtwhile service to the world Muslim community.\n\nI am to be married soon, my wife will move to my location after Nikkah and she has indicated that in when death comes, she would like to be buried where she was born near a grandparent's final resting place. Is this allowable in islam?\n\nI would have liked her to be buried next to me (or visa versa). I would have liked to be buried anywhere near our new home.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah\n\n \n\nBrother/Sister in Islam\n\n \n\nYou are going to get married soon. It is a happy occasion. You have not got together yet and you’ll are talking about death. Whilst every individual should be conscious of death at all times, this is not the occasion to discuss and talk about it. First get married and get used to one another.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nThe ask imam site will not process questions from October 23 till October 27.
