  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe details of your question are not clear. Our response is based on our understanding of the question. If our understanding is incorrect, you may rephrase your question and resend it to us.%0D%0A%0D%0AAccording to our understanding, the question is whether a member of the medical aid scheme can present his prescription to a pharmacist and get any item from the pharmacist, who in turn will claim a full prescription value from the medical aid company. This is done merely for the pharmacy?s claim to be legitimate, even though that is not the true reflection of the reality of the matter.%0D%0A%0D%0AAt the outset, we wish to point out that it is not permissible for a Muslim to voluntarily take out a conventional medical aid. If he is compelled by law, then only he will be excused. In such a situation, the member must adhere to those rules of the company that are not against the Shari?ah. It is prohibited to violate the rules of the company and create leeways by speaking lies, etc. to legitimise onelself being a recipient of the medical aid scheme.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai"
