  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf someone dies, he has in his will to be buried in the coffin, what must be done, either listen and burry him in the coffin as they wish, or say no that is not Islamic.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nAs-salāmu 'alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.\n\nNabi (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, I leave with you two matters, you will not be misguided as long as you hold steadfast to them. One is the book of Allah and the second is the Sunnat of his messenger (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). (Mishkaat pg.31) \n\nWith regards to burial, the closest method to Sunnat is to bury a person without a coffin. However, the Fuqahaa have ruled that in cases of necessity, e.g. ground being extremely soft, a coffin may be used. (Shaami). Hence, if there is a necessity for burial in a coffin in the enquired case, then only the persons bequest may be executed.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
