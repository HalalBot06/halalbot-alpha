  "question": "If something about Islam bothers you what are you supposed to do?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nIf something about Islam bothers you what are you supposed to do? A few months ago I was waking up for tahajjud, not watching any TV, and not listening to any music. Now, I have a hard time getting up for fajr and praying my salaahs on time! The thing is, I found out something about Islam and it upset me very much. But I always knew in my heart Islam is the true religion, I just don't know how to go back to where I was before. I try to make dua, but to be honest I feel very disconnected to Allah(swt). I don't really feel like he cares about me, and even though it shouldn't matter because I know I don't deserve it, it does matter to me and I don't know what to do. Please help me because I really don't want to die in this state.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nWhen something bothers you, you should seek assistance. Alhamdulillah, you emailed us to seek our assistance. This is actually tawfeeq from Allah. Allah wished to grant you His favour and mercy and put it in your heart to seek our assistance. If Allah didn’t care about you, you wouldn’t have bothered and you wouldn’t have the urge to correspond with us. He created the means for your change and reformation. Now it is up to you to follow the advice.\n\nBrother, Allah Taala created us for a purpose, which is to worship Him. That purpose must be kept before us at all times and upheld at any costs. If one has to perform hajj and undertake a journey he has to concentrate in reaching Makkah Mukarramah. Then only will he be able to perform hajj. If he is lazy, he might not leave home. He has to sacrifice and undertake the difficulties of the journey to reach Makkah Mukarramah. Then only he will fulfill his purpose of travel and perform hajj. This life is a journey to the hereafter. Success in the hereafter also depends on sacrifice. One cannot be lazy and expect to be eternally successful. That does not happen even in this world.\n\nFocus on the purpose of life and adjust yourself accordingly. Do not follow feelings and emotions. That is not consistent and varies.\n\nWe know Allah is our Creator and All Powerful. We have to worship Him and do all the things He wants us to do. In that lies our peace and eternal salvation. When you sacrifice and follow the injunctions of Shariah, you will feel the connection on condition you abstain from sins. Music and TV are sins and deprive one of the Nur of Allah in ones heart. That is why one feels disconnected. Don’t think evil and don’t see evil. It is more important to abstain from sins than doing acts of virtue. Furthermore, fulfill your fardh acts to the best of your ability. Perform the five daily salahs. Thereafter, perform acts of virtue to the best of your ability. Adopt a sustainable pattern and be punctual on that. You will then not be frustrated and you will make steady progress. Remember, no one progresses without effort and sacrifice. That is the key to success.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
