  "question": "I'm the only Muslim in my school and am forced to take the kafr as friends, how should my relationship be towards them, is it permisible to be their friend?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThere are three categories of associating with people:%0D%0A%0D%0A1) Mu'aamalaat (dealings)%0D%0A2) Muwaasaat (kindness)%0D%0A3) Muwaalaat (bosom friendship)%0D%0A%0D%0AAssociation of the first and second categories (dealings and kindness) with%0D%0Athe kuffaar is permissible. Rasulullah Sallallahu alayhi wa Sallam was very%0D%0Akind and polite with the kuffaar. He also contracted business dealings with%0D%0Athem. However, Muwaalaat (bosom friendship) with the kuffaar is strictly%0D%0Aprohibited as that may be detrimental to one's Islamic values and%0D%0Aprinciples.%0D%0ADetest very strongly the evils of the kuffaar but do not hate them%0D%0Apersonally. Strive to influence them towards Islam, but never be invited by%0D%0Atheir way of life. Always adorn your heart with the consciousness of Islam%0D%0Abeing the most superior way of life , and that there is no reason at all to%0D%0Afeel inferior. Win over the kuffaar with good character, yet never%0D%0Acompromise the principles of Deen. May Allah Ta'ala make us all true%0D%0Ainviters towards Islam.%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best,%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti E. Desai%0D%0A"
