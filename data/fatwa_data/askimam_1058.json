Now after you releave yourself and you want to clean yourself with water the water splashes over you from the bowl. Do you become impure after this water is on you becaues it is dirty. what I have been doing is that I wet toliet tissue and clean it that way but it is very difficult. What can I do?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nWe suggest you wash yourself after flushing the toilet and thereafter place\nsufficient toilet paper in the bowl before washing yourself in order to\navoid the splashes.\n\nA water container with a long and thin nossel may assist in controlling the\nwater from splashing as the water will come out slowly.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
