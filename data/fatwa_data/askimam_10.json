  "question": "What are, broadly, the main differences between the Malikis and the Hanbalis?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe differences between the four famous Jurists Imaam Abu Hanifa, Shaaf'ee, Maaliki and Hanbaliy stem from their differences on principles. The basic\nprinciple according to Imaam Maaliki is to prefer Amal-e-Madinah, that is the practices of the people of Madina Munawwarah.\n\nHowever, that principle is not adopted by Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
