  "question": "What duas should I make to find solutions to various problems I am curently facing n my life?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nSalam Mufti Sahab: I am facing problems with my parents as they are developing very negative approach towards every issue in life. They criticize on people alot and find faults in every person. They think there way is always the best. I have tried convinsing them and also tried to show them the other side of the picture but they never listen and start arguing. I am so scared cuz I donno where this is going to lead all of us please tell me any duas to make during this month of ramadan and any help or suggestions or tips u can offer me to make things better? also please note I don't misbehave with them nor do I yell or scream to make my point through but their constant negativeness annoys me.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nTo convince one's parents is not always an easy task, but always remember\nthat you must always respect you parents ans follow them as long as their\nrequest s are within the Shariah. If this is not possible and you have tried\nto talk to them with wisdom and they are still not changing then you need to\ndicuss this problem with an elder that they show some respect to and ask of\nhim to talk to the parents, this would help, Inshallah.\n\nYou must also make a lot of Dua for Allah to guide them and us all to attain\nunderstanding. You can make the following Dua, \"All praise is due to Allah\nWho saved me from which He tested you with and Who most certainly favoured\nme over much of His creation.\" Also \"Allah is sufficient for me and how fine\na trustee (Allah is).\"\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nShaykh Irshaadh Amod\nfor: FATWA DEPT."
