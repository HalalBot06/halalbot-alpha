  "question": "Should I correct their mistakes or return their belongings?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nI drive a taxi in a society of kuffar.They have no respect whatsoever for a person doing this job and I experience disrespect from the passengers very often . Not to mention that the kuffar authorities are passing unrealistic laws and rules to make this job even tougher for the drivers, for they see them only as a bunch of immigrants that they despise and take advantage of their unfortunate situation. 2 questions: 1. There are times when the kuffar passengers forget their belongings (wallets, bags, documents,...) in my taxi . As a muslim, should I return their belongings? 2. There are times when the kuffar passengers (sometimes half-drunk) hand me a large denomination bill (for example: $100) while thinking that it's a smaller denomination bill (for example: $1.) . As a Muslim, should I correct their mistake and let them know that they might have confused the different bills?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. In principle, you are not obliged to personally return the belongings of\nyour passengers. They should come forward and claim for them. Should they do\nso, you are obliged to return their belongings to them.\n2. You should correct them and not take more than what you are entitled to.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
