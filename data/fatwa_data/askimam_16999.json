  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nPlease advise my husband and i had a fight and he said i Talaaq u and said so 3 times. No one else was at home besides the 2 of us, does this mean that i am now divorced. Please do advise soonest\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\nThere is no need to have a witness for talaq to take place.Â  If a wife is given three talaqs, then it is not permissible to re-marry her until halala takes place. The procedure of halala is that after the wife completes her iddat of talaq, she will have to marry another man and consummate the marriage. Thereafter, the 2nd husband will give her talaq and she will complete the iddat of this talaq. After the expiry of her iddat, she may re-marry the first husband if they desire to do so.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai (F2)\nDarul Iftaa"
