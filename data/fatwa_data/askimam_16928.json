  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nTwo years ago, my wife is diagnosed that her two fallopian tubes are blocked & that fibroids have started growing in her uterus. Our fertility experts & gyneacologists all say 'the only option for conception' is IVF even though my fertility is OK [i.e. positive semem analysis result]. We tried IVF once last year, but it failed [by Allah's Will]. Due to the high cost of IVF in our middle east city [UAE], my question is, should I spend whatever I'm able to save from my salary on hajj, umrah-in-ramadan, or more IVF trials in order to have pious children inshaAllah? I can only afford one of the three desires except as Allah wills or miraculously provides. Which should Imake a priority & which option[s] is more virtuous according to sharia [as we desire pious children & hajj/umrah]? shukria.\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n1) IVF, or In Vitro Fertilization, is permissible according to Shari'ah when a woman experiences great difficulty in conceiving a child. However, the following conditions must be observed:\n\na) Only the sperm of the husband may be used\n\nb) A surrogate mother may not be used (The sperm of the husband must be inseminated into his wife only and no other woman)\n\n(Jami'ul Fatawa, 1/469, Rabbani Book Depot)\n\n2) The performance of Umrah in Ramadan is extremely virtuous, but is not necessary. Hajj is one of the fundamental pillars of Islam and is fardh for those who can afford to perform Hajj. Having children is not a necessity in Shari'ah. Therefore, you should perform your Hajj if you have the means to do so.\n\nIt must be remembered that everything is subject to the will of Allah Ta'ala. As Muslims, we should appreciate and accept that granting of children is the sole prerogative of Allah Ta'ala. At times, Allah may not grant a couple children, whilst this is also a blessing unto them. One should be patient and constantly make dua to Allah Ta'ala.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMl.
