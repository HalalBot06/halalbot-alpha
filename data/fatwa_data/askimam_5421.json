  "question": "Please kindly interpret my dream about Dajjal.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nIn my dream I was looking out the window from my apartment and I saw a group of people sitting on the lawn in front of the building next to mine. In the group a man was lecturing. He was a young man with beard, long hair till the ear with glasses. The man was wearing sunnah clothes. I don't remember if I thought the man was Dajjal or not but I started yelling that the Dajjal is here. A mehdi pathan family lives in the apartment above us. In the dream they sent us food and I see myself telling my family not to eat it, that it's poison and that it?s the dajjal's trap. After that I hear a knock, I open the door and it is my neighbor, who lives in front of us. She asks me if we have almonds. Near the doorway I'm giving her the almonds in a bowl, but suddenly I feel as the Dajjal is coming down the building stairs, but I don't see anything. So I just throw the almonds at her and they fall. I yell at my neighbor to run and start reading the Quran. Then I slammed the door. After I woke up I felt that the man lecturing was Zakir Naik.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe dream is an indication of your Imaan being strong and sensitivity to the\ntricks and traps of Dajjaal. May Allah Ta'ala protect us all from the\nDajjaal, Aameen.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
