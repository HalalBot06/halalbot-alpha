  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nAnyways, I am a Buddhist and the woman I am in love with is Muslim. We've  been in this relationship for more than 3 years and we believe our  relationship is something real special, we love each other heaps. However,  our parents do not know about our relationship. We know we are doing  something wrong to them but we have always respected them and listened to  them in every aspect of life.\n\nAnyways, we've always overcome every single problem we've faced together and  i believe that we are really strong together. However, her parents are going  on Hajj this year and we were wondering whether continung on the  relationship during it and also afterwards would effect their pilgrimmage??  Would it negatively effect their Hajj?? Any proof from hadiths would be helpful as well.\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nAt the outset, we wish to inform you that it is not lawful for you to have any relation with a Muslim girl. According to the Shariah Laws, it is not permissible for a Muslim female to marry a non Muslim male. However, we understand from the email that you are well acquainted with Islam and its rules. We therefore urge you to accept Islam and then marry the girl. Until then you should abstain from having any contact with her.\n\nIf the girl has reached a marriageable age, the parents should ensure that a suitable match is found and get her married. Otherwise, the evils that flow from the delay in marriage are self evident.\n\nYour illegitimate relationship with the girl will not affect the validity of her parent’s Hajj. However, that should not be taken as a licence to continue with your relationship. You should inform your parents that you intend marrying the girl, accept Islam and marry her and live a life free of sin.\n\nAnd Allah knows best"
