Will you keep quiet because she will get upset with you? Surely you wont listen to her and inform her seniors in order to save her live, adopt the same approach here. Don’t be concerned of losing your friendship with her if you love her, help her. She does not want to help herself. Get her seniors and family members to help her. If you keep quiet and your friends life will be ruined, you will be sinful. Your friend will also hold you responsible for her pain as she would think that you should have taken her out of the mess. She couldn’t come out of it by herself as she was emotionally trapped. If you inform her parents and she is liberated then she will appreciate you. Go ahead and inform her parents. You are bound to do so by Shariah, also present their fatwa to them.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\n\n \n\n \n\nThe ask imam site will not process questions from October 23 till October 27.
