  "answer": "QUESTION\ni suffer from urine drops falling all the time..for that purpose i use a cloth to clear the drops before wudhu...have been doing this since long....the question is...will my clothes be clean? as in i use the same cloth for 10 days...its has many drops of urine on it (obviously it has dried up from previous wipe every time i use it again) ..will i have to repeat all prayers? i think this cloth is napaak (even tough it is dry)\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nYou should ascertain whether you fall in the category of a Ma?zoor or not. For that, kindly refer ?Rules Pertaining to the Ma?zur? ? attached.\n\nIf you are a Ma?zoor, then there is no need for you to wipe the urine drops. If you are not a Ma?zoor, then you should not have the cloth on while performing Salaat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
