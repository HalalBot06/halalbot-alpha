Therefore, in calculating zakāh you will not count your wife’s jewellery and other belongings. She will pay her zakāh individually from you.\n\n \n\nYou stated in your query that “my wife brought gold jewellery with her on which her mother used to pay zakat every ramadan...” if your wife’s mother owns the jewellery and is merely borrowing the jewellery to your wife then your mother in law would have to discharge the zakāh of the jewellery. If your wife owns the jewellery then it is her responsibility to discharge the zakāh. As niyyah (intention) is a prerequisite for the fulfilment of zakāh, if you wish to discharge your wife’s zakāh you would have to first ask her consent.\n\n \n\nالبحر الرائق - (ج 2 / ص 210)\n\nولو أدى زكاة غيره بغير أمره فبلغه فأجاز لم يجز ؛ لأنها وجدت نفاذا على المتصدق ؛ لأنها ملكه ، ولم يصر نائبا عن غيره فنفذت عليه ولو تصدق عنه بأمره جاز ويرجع بما دفع عند أبي يوسف ، وإن لم يشترط الرجوع كالأمر بقضاء الدين وعند محمد لا رجوع له إلا بالشرط ، وتمامه في الخانية\n\n \n\nAt the end of your zakātable year you need to calculate all your wealth, even though a complete year might have not passed on the total amount. For example, a person calculates his zakāh on the 1st of Ramadhān. On the 1st of Ramadhān he owns R20 000 worth of jewellery. On the 20th of Safar he bought more jewellery to the value of R10 000. The next year on the 1st of Ramadhān he would pay zakāh on the total value of R30 000.\n\n \n\nThe answers to your queries are as follows:\n\n \n\nZakāh has become wājib (obligatory) in Ramadhān. You could pay it whenever possible. However, you should not delay unnecessarily.\n\n \n\nZakāh would be calculated from the date a person became sahib nisāb (a person owned the minimum amount required for zakāh). If your wife owned the nisāb amount before receiving the jewellery etc then she would add the jewellery to her previous nisāb. If she did not own the nisāb then she would calculate her year from the time she owns the nisāb. Zakāh would be calculated according to the lunar calendar.\n\n \n\nWhen calculating the amount of zakāh a person will add the amount of cash at hand, stock of trade (in any), debt receivable and amount of gold and silver. Thereafter, you minus any debts payable. 2.5% of the total will be your zakāh payable. Below is a table to illustrate the calculation of zakāh:\n\n \n\nExample of Calculating zakāh\n\n\n\n\nCash\n\n\t\n\nR10 000\n\n\n\n\nStock\n\n\t\n\nR10 000\n\n\n\n\nDebts Receivable\n\n\t\n\nR10 000\n\n\n\n\nJewellery (Gold, Silver)\n\n\t\n\nR10 000\n\n\n\n\nOther zakātable Items\n\n\t\n\nR10 000\n\n\n\n\nDebts Payable\n\n\t\n\nR10 000\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\t\n\nR40 000\n\n\n\n\nX 2.5%\n\n\t\n\nR1000\n\n \n\n \n\nThe amount of nisāb is 87.48 grams of gold or 612.36 grams of silver. (Ahsanul Fatāwā 4/264) If a person owns gold, silver or cash to the value of the nisāb he will have to give zakāh. You should find out the price of gold/silver in Australia and calculate it to the above given nisāb.\n\n \n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl. Ishaq E.
