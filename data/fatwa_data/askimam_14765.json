  "question": "hope you will help me to live a happy life with peaceful mind........",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nI hope you will help me to live a happy life with peaceful mind.\nIts in quran and hadiths, one should worship, none other than Almighty Allah or should not include any other god with Almighty Allah. its a big sin........ on other hand it has ordered that one should obey & respect their parents at any cost until and unless they are not shirk.\nWhat should a child do, if the parents themselves are including idols with Allah and his Vali's and auliyas.\nI want to be very clear with the question, and in short i'll tell whats happening with my parents\n\nSir. My father and his sister Raziya says that allah has sent an angel specially for them who they call Hakim Saheb & Baba Huzur, and they offer niyaz on some sweets and keep them in a closed room for some time, where only raziya stays for 10 minutes and then she also comes to other room. and after some time when all the peoples goes to that room, it seems like some one has tasted from that sweets, and raziya says that the angel and my grandfather (my fathers father spirit) has come and tasted that sweets.\nAnd they say that the angel which is coming to them is none other than krishna (hindus god), and according to my father and raziya krishna is part of our islam, when i asked them about this angel (Krishna) they told that the angel is (naa' uzubillah) Hazrat Ali. they say that krishna is Hazrat Ali, whome god has sent for them.\nI have seen the idol of krishna in my house, and also in raziyas house and photos of krishna in fathers bag and vallet.\n\nNow the most surprising thing is this, that raziya and my father offer namaz regularly, adhere to the orders of islam properly, and offer niaz of Gous-e-azam (Hazrat Abdul kadar jilani) and Kunde ki Niyaz(Imam Jafar-e-Sadiq). but along with these things they say that krishna is part of islam.\n\nI know that this things are of KAAFIRS, and no way krishna is related to islam. and when i started doubting all these things, one day that Angel(baba huzur) left a letter in the niyaz musalla that, Mansoor(my name) is no more in islam, bcos he didnt believe in what Amanullah(my father) and raziya(fathers sister) is telling him, so allah has set him out of his beloved worshippers and allah hates mansoor.\n\nOne more thing my father and raziya and other peoples of my family who believed in these things used to keep a letter of their problem in the niyaz they offer, and after 10 or 15 minutes when we all goes to that niaz room, they get answers for their problems written on the same paper in urdu, after having a doubt when i investigated all these things with a proper aalims, those aalims told that nothing is like that, these all r false things, main culprit is Raziya, she has done some amaliyat on my father for his money and wealth. and raziya is writing those letter and telling us that angel has written the answers with order of allah.\n\nalso aalims told that water of these peoples house is haram on momin, they r kaafiro mooshrik\n\nafter that i advised my father several times that these things r wrong. but he became completely against me and now i am out of my house since 6 yrs, i left my house 6 yrs back and came to my Mamu's house in another city.\n\nnow, sir please tell me, am i a sinner, i tried a lot to bring my father on right path but, he believes only and only his sister, no one else not even my mummy.\n\nnow i m married to my mamu's daughter since 5 yrs and has a son of 2 yrs, when my wife called my father on phone, he told that mansoor has hurted me and my wife (my mom n dad) thats y god will punish you, all your life. Mansoor is a big sinner.\n\nmy father is telling me to apologise in front of each and every person of family that whatever i told about raziya is wrong, and raziya is doing all right things.\n\ntell me what should i do, its a serious problem as it is about parents.\n\ni dnt wanna be a sinner in front of allah at the time of judgement day (Qayamat).\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nThank Allah and make Shukr to Him for guiding you on the straight path.  Also thank Allah for saving you from following what your father and sister does.  You should remain firm on Islam and never be led on the path of your father and sister.  With that, you should also maintain family ties and be respectful to your parents.  Your difference in Deen with them should not lead you to breaking family ties and being disrespectful to your parents. Your family will feel hurt as you did not follow their path and moved away from them.  You will not be sinful for that as you did it to preserve your Deen.  Infact, that is a great sacrifice and you will be greatly rewarded for it.  Ebrahim (Alayhis-Salam) first advised his father against idol worship and then left his family.  Be firm on Islam and maintain your contact with your family. Be loving and kind towards them with the intention of Dawah and guiding them on the right path.  Probably, they will be hard in you initially but with your continuous good character and love for them, they will soften up.  Be strong and courageous.  Allah will reward you for the pain you experience as all that is for Deen and Islam.  The example of Ebrahim (Alayhis-Salam) is in front of you.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
