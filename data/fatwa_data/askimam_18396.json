  "question": "Watching Porn before getting Married",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n1. I am posting regarding watching of porn movies before getting married. 2. Regarding Saying salam how should one reply ?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\n\n \n\n1.       Marriage is the beginning of a life-long undertaking. It requires from both spouses a promising and positive input. For this reason, preparations are set in motion long before the date of nikāh. Similarly, it is crucial that both spouses spiritually develop themselves before nikāh whereby it is a means of barakah (blessings). Watching of movies, especially porn, will definitely result in a decrease of spirituality. Therefore, it is utterly repulsive and harām (forbidden) in Islām to watch any type of pornography.\n\n \n\n2.       The best words that a person may use when intending to greet another are “As-salāmu ῾alaykum wa rahmatullāhi wabarakātuh” and the reply should be “Wa-῾alaykum us-salām wa rahmatullāhi wabarakātuh”.\n\n \n\n(Fatāwa Mahmūdiyyah v19 pg60)\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalaamu `alaykum\n\nMl. Mohammed Moola,\nStudent Darul Iftaa\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
