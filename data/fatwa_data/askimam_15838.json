  "question": "I was recently told that plucking your eyebrows is allowed as long as you do not remove a single line of hair. Does this mean one can remove stray and untidy hairs to neaten the eyebrows?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\n\nGrowing up as a young girl I was raised to know that it is haram to shape or pluck your eyebrows.  However,plucking eyebrows seems to be a common practice amongst many muslim ladies and I was recently told that plucking your eyebrows is allowed as long as you do not remove a single line of hair.  Does this mean one can remove stray and untidy hairs to neaten the eyebrows?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nIt is prohibited to shape eyebrows by plucking them or shaving them. At most, one may only remove the stray strands of the eyebrows.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
