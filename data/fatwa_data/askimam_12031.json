  "question": "When praying Zuhr in Qasr, in the 2nd rakaat after Atahayyaat, I started saying AllahuAkbar and getting up, then realized I was in Qasr, and and continued Durood-e-Ibraheem. Is Sajda-Sauw required?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDuring my Zuhr Qasr, when I joined late, in the 4th rakaat behind an Imam, after standing up after Salaam, do I pray remaining 3 rakaats or just 1 rakaat? How about when Imam is also doing Qasr? What if I don't know if Imam is doing Qasr or not?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1. If you got up so much that you were closer to standing then sitting i.e. you had straightened your legs, then it would be necessary to make sajda as-Sahw. If you were closer to sitting, then returned, Sajda us-Sahw would not be neccessary. (Imdaad al-Fataah Pg.516)\n\n2. If you are a musafir who is performing salah behind an Imam, then you would adopt the salah of the Imam ie. if he is a Musafir as well, you would perform Qasr and if not then you would perform complete salah. Thus in this case, you should have read 3 Rakaat after salaam not one.\n\nIf the Imam is a musafir, then he should make an announcement straight after the salam, informing the congregation that he is a musafir, thus if any of them is not one, he should complete his salah.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
