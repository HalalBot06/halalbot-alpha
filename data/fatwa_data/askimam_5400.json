  "answer": "QUESTION\n1.My Aunt told me not to wear black shoes as black is the colour of sadness and un-happiness. Someone in my family also said that his friend saw Hazrat Ali (RA) in his dream and he told him to stop wearing black shoes. Please tell me if wearing certain colours has any effect whatsoever in one's life? 2.I have heard that pictures made on the carpets are allowed. Are pictures on carpets permissible, i.e. pictures which are walked on (such as pictures on carpets).Can we Perform Prayer in that room? Please clarify this issue.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n1) All colors are permissible for males with the exception of saffron dyed\nred or yellow attire. We have not come across any indication that black is\nobjectionable.(Fataawa Mahmoodiyyah Vol. 12 Pg. 331 & Vol. 8 Pg. 294). In\nfact, on many occasions, Nabi (S.A.W) himself wore a black turban.\n2) Pictures of animate objects are allowed on carpets or cushions only if\nthe heads have been effaced. (Mirqaat Vol. 8 Pg. 329 Ashrafiyyah) It is\nMakrooh (detestable) to choose for Salaah a place offering distractions e.g.\nin front of a mirror or picture. It is obvious that animate and inanimate\npictures are equal in this regard.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Bilaal Cassim\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED CORRECT: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
