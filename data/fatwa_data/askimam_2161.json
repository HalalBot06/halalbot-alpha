  "question": "Is it permissible to stun an animal before slaughtering?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nDue to many negative factors, for example, blood clotting, stunning\nwithout any reason is Makrooh (reprehensible). (Shaami vol.6 pg.296; HM\nSaeed)\n\nIf the animal is wild and uncontrollable, then only will one be excused for\nstunning the animal. The sacrifice will be valid only if the animal was\nalive at the time of slaughtering after the stunning.\n\nFrom: Al Mahmood 13 Q & A from the Darul Ifta\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
