  "question": "Blood tests while fasting.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalamulaikum Mufti Saheb. I am in my fourth month of pregnancy & part of my gynae (a female) visits mean having a blood test or internal check. Does this nullify one's roza. Also, what happens if I don't feel too well and cannot manage to keep all my roza's. Can I fulfil it later? Wassalam\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIn principle, a pregnant person is excused from the Fardh fasting of\nRamadhaan. She may make up for the missed fasts later.\n\nIt is permissible for a fasting person to have a blood test. That does not\ninvalidate the fast. Similarly, if there is a dire need for an internal\ncheck, that too does not invalidate the fast. You should advise your\ngynaecologist on that.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
