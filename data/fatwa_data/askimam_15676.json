  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n\n\nRegarding Fatwa 13974 ( for all the situations) How would a woman know if she became pregnant because sometimes pregnant women discharge yellow, brown, red etc?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh\n\nYour question is not clear. We assume you mean, what would a pregnant woman do if she is discharging and is as yet unaware she is pregnant?\n\nIn that case, she should initially follow the ruling which applies to her in the above mentioned answer. When she eventually realises she is pregnant, she must make Qadha of the Salaah she missed during the period she assumed was her menses, as this was not menses but was rather Istihaadha.\n\nAlternatively, if you mean, medically how would a woman know if she is pregnant? Then,Â she should consult her physician.\n\nAnd Allah knows best\n\nWassalam\n\nMufti Musa Kajee\n\nChecked and Approved by:\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
