  "question": "My husband and I have no children yet. I am capable of having them but need fertility drugs. Should I take the drugs?",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMy fear is that by not taking them I am preventing Allah SWT from performing a miracle. Is it haraam not to want children?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible to take the fertility drugs. The medication will work only\nif Allah Wills.\n\nHaving a child after taking the drug will not be inconsistent with the\nmiracle of Allah Ta'ala.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
