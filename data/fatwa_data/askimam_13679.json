  "answer": "QUESTION\nis it permissible for a girl of 13 yrs to colour her hair?if yes will the wudhu be ok\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nIn principle, it is permissible for a female to dye her hair in any colour besides black. However, it has become a trend and fashion, especially among immoral women and those who do not adhere to the Shariâ€™ah laws of Hijaab to dye their hair in colours matching their outfits. Certain hair dye colours like red, orange, etc. have also become prominent fashion colours.\n\nIt is not permissible for Muslim woman to follow the trend and fashion of non-Muslim woman and immoral woman. It is also the responsibility of parents to guide and nurture their young daughters to stay away from un-Islamic codes and practices.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
