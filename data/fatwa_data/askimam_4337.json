  "question": "A few questions on prophet Isa (p.b.u.h) and some other questions im having trouble answering, when asked by Christians.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nWhen it calls Isa (p.b.u.h) in the Quran messiah, is that (messiah) just another word for prophet or messenger? In the Christian belief , they believe that jesus died and came back to life after 3 days, what makes the Christians believe that ? Because muslims believe that Allah took prophet Isa (p.b.u.h) to heaven, so what imposter said that he was jesus and returned from the dead ? Also a Christian asked me a few questions that I had trouble answering .1) How does Allah help a person improve their moral character? 2) And does Allah of Islam provide a person any supernatural help to fight their internal Jihad? 3) How can Allah help an alchoholic overcome their addiction? Thank you and my Allah bless you all\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe equivalent if Messiah in the Quraan is Maseeh which means to touch, a%0D%0Amiracle given to him by Allah to cure terminally ill people with his touch,%0D%0Asuch as the permanently blind, leper, deaf and dumb. As a Muslim, it is an%0D%0Aintegral part of our faith to believe in Easa (AS). It is our belief he was%0D%0Araised to the skies and is alive. He never died. He will return to earth and%0D%0Alead a normal life, marry, have children and die a natural death.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe subsequent three questions relate to internal reformation of the soul.%0D%0AThat was one of the basic missions of Rasulullah (S.A.W.), in which he was%0D%0Asuccessful. He reformed people who were murderers, alcoholics, and had no%0D%0Avalue for life. He granted woman dignity and respect. All that he achieved%0D%0Awithin a very short space of time by conscientising them of the Oneness of%0D%0AAllah, His love and mercy, and the concept of accountability after death in%0D%0Athe court of Allah.%0D%0A%0D%0Aand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best%0D%0A%0D%0AMufti Ebrahim Desai%0D%0AFATWA DEPT.%0D%0A"
