  "question": "Problems with Memory...Dua Requested.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nAssalam-wa-alikum I'm currently doing hifz in a madrasa in India. But i have having trouble memorizing. I memorize about 7 ayats in 2 hours (which is very slow to me). I once read of a hadith/dua where you get up for Tahajud and recite the four suras: Mulk Sajda Yaaseen and Dukkan and recite a dua afterwards, but i dont know any of the suras, and looking at my current speed, it will take a very long time to memorize these. I saw a dua on your site that said to read, \"Rabbi shali sadri, wa yasirle amri, wah-lal ugtami, was yaf ka who kawli,\" or something like that after fajt 25 times, but it doesnt seem to work. Can you please direct me to some duas for, if possible, phtographic memory? Also when i memorize, alot of times when i take a break for 1/2 hr, i forget much that i memorized. Can you give me a dua to keep that which i memorize in my mind.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAllah Ta'ala created every individual with certain qualities. Some have very\ngood memories and others don't. That is natural and nothing to be worried\nabout.\n\nYou should continue your memorising of the Qur'aan according to your natural\nability. You should not exert yourself beyond that and neither should you\nbe worried. The Du'aas and Wazeefas are to enhance your memory. If you made\nthose Du'aas, leave the effect of your Du'aa to Allah Ta'ala. The Du'aa will\nhave effect in some area of your life. That is beyond our\ncomprehension.\n\nWe also advise that you place your right hand on your forehead after every\nFardh Salaat and recite, 'Yaa Qawiyyu' 11 times.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
