  "answer": "QUESTION\nIf you are in love with a Muslim brother/sister, and he/she does not in turn love you back, and does not understand how painful the whole experience is for you, would it be alright to make du'a to Allah (SWT) to make this person go through the same experience you're going through (i.e. of falling in love with someone who does not in turn love you back), so that this person can better appreciate what it feels like to go through the ordeal of unrequited love, and would hence (hopefully) be more understanding of your misery and pain? \nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nDesiring to see a Muslim in pain and grief is a quality of a disbeliever. Allah Ta’ala states, ‘They (Kuffaar) only desire your ruin.’ (Surah3 Aayat118). To the contrary, Nabi [sallallaahu alayhi wasallam] mentioned that none of you shall attain perfect Imaan until He desires for his brother that which he loves for himself. (Jaamius saghir Hadith9939; Ilmiyah)\n\nIn view of the above, we advise that if you want to marry this woman, then propose for her hand in marriage and sincerely make du’aa to Allah for a favourable reply as he is the ultimate controller of the hearts. If you are refused, then accept and be content with the decree of Allah, have firm belief that Allah in His infinite and complete knowledge has decreed that which is best for you and be hopeful that Allah has decreed someone that is better for you.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
