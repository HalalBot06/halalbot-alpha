  "question": "Shafi madhab and correspondence course in islam",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nDear Muhtaram Mufti Assalamu alaikum I would like to know if there are any dar ul ulooms which teach Shafi madhab in UK, South Africa etc. I would also like to know if learning islam via correspondence through the American open university (http://www.open-university.edu/) which is apparently recognised by the prestigious Al Azhar university in cairo, would be a good way of learning Islamic aqeeda and concepts. Jazkallahumal khair.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nOur institute, Dar al-`Ulum al-`Arabiyyah al-Islamiyyah (mt_k@hotmail.com),\nin the Western Cape, South Africa, teaches the Shafi'i madhhab. I will\ncomment upon the American Open University to persons more equipped and\ninformed than myself.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nShaykh Taha Karaan\nDARUL ULOOM AL-ARABIYYA AL-ISLAAMIYYAH"
