What rights my islamic rights? How can I solved this problem? Can you please e-mail me with the answer? Jazakallah.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nAs salaamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu\n\nDear respected Brother in Islam,\n\nWe deeply regret the contents of your letter and may Allah Ta'ala assist you in resolving the dispute.\n\nAs a point we wish to inform you that it is not permissible to charge the 15% increase on the debt, as that is interest.\n\nIn order to resolve the dispute, we suggest you inform them that you will not take the 15% increase for the past two years as well as in the future since that will be a considerable decrease of approximately R35,000 over the approximately 114 months (nine and half years), therefore they should also consider and expedite previous & timeous payments. We hope this offer will serve as an incentive and amicably resolve the dispute.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
