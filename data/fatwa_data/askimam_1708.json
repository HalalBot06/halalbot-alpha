  "question": "Recently, I did Istikhara regarding an issue, and had a dream. How do I know whether or not this dream is from Allah, or it is just a reflection of my mind.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nThe answer to an Istikhara is not necessarily in the form of a dream. It may\nalso be in the form of a feeling in the heart . Upon making Istikhara if one\nis content, then it is a positive sign. If you have seen a dream and did not\nunderstand its meaning, then you should refer to a person who is able to\ninterpret the drean for you. We furhter advise that in making decisions you\nshould also make mashwara(consultation) with reliable people.\n\nAnd Allah Ta'ala knows best\n\nMufti E. Desai"
