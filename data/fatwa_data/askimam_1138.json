  "question": "I live in Saudi Arabia. Is is permissible to eat without checking the source.",
  "answer": "QUESTION\nMost of the food items and even ingredients for local food factories are imported in saudi Arabia. 95 % of resturants use meet that comes from Newzeland and Brazil with halah label. Many scholars here eat normally and give fatwas that it is halal to eat as long as the government is Muslim. Please clarify.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nEvery individual is duty bound by the Shari?ah to exercise precaution in eating Halaal and Tayyib foods.\n\nTayyib foods refers to food that is Halaal beyond doubt. Since Saudia Arabia imports meat, you do not know whether the Halaal label is authentic or not. Therefore, it is incorrect to rely on the Halaal labels and consume the meat.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
