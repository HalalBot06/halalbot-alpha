  "answer": "QUESTION\n\n \n\nIs it permissible to urinate in shadow(especially trees) as i have heard that it is the resting place of jinns so, we should avoid urinating in shadows?\n\nIf a person makes wudhu in clothes having dried semens on it (after wet dream) but changes the dress before making salah, will his salah will be validate?\n\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\nIn the name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\n\nAssalāmu ῾alaykum wa Rahmatullāhi Wabarakātuh\n\n \n\nIt is considered reprehensible (makrūh) to urinate in a shaded area, namely that of a tree, due to being an area that people normally take rest in.  This principle is commonly mentioned in books of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and is based on a hadith narrated by Imam Muslim (r.a.) and Imam Abū Dāwūd (r.a.) that the Prophet (s.a.w.) said:\n\n \n\n  \"اتَّقُوا اللَّعَّانَيْنِ. قَالُوا: وَمَا اللَّعَّانَانِ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ قَالَ: الَّذِى يَتَخَلَّى فِى طَرِيقِ النَّاسِ أَوْ فِى ظِلِّهِمْ\"\n\n \n\n“Beware of those two acts which cause others to curse.”  They asked, “What are those two acts?”  He replied, “Relieving one’s self in the people’s walkways or in their shades.” –Muslim and Abu Dāwūd\n\n           \n\nIf a person makes wudhū’ in clothes having dried semen, this will have no implications on the validity of his wudhū’.  However, in accordance with general principles of cleanliness, one should refrain from wearing impure clothing.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, if a person had an emission of seminal fluid, be it through a wet dream or any other manner, a ritual bath (ghusl) is required in order to purify his self and wudhū’ alone will not suffice.\n\nAnd Allāh Ta῾āla Knows Best\n\nWassalāmu ῾alaykum \n\n\n\n\nMl.
