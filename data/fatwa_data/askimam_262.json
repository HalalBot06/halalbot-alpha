  "answer": "QUESTION\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPrincipally, if the alcohol is extracted from grapes or dates it is not\npermissible. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, 'Khamr (wine) is\nfrom these two trees, dates and grapes.' (Mishkãt p. 317).\n\nFurthermore, Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, 'Alcohol itself\nis prohibited and intoxication in every other beverage.' (Hidaaya vol. 4 p.\n497).\n\nIn view of the abovementioned Hadith, since the alcohol in coke is from\nethanol which is fermented from sugar cane mollasses and does not\nintoxicate, it is permissible.\n\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai"
