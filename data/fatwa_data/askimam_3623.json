  "answer": "QUESTION\nI am student of M.Sc Computer Science in USA. Origionally I am from Pakistan. I am in need of money to pay my tuition fees and other expenses. I have been looking for a clean job (where I don't have to deal with haram things) for past two months but I haven't found any yet. So is it permissible for me to work at a place (like gas-statio + convenience store) where I have to deal with haram things, like lottery tickets, cigarettes etc, until I find any other clean job where there are no haram things. If its not permissible than can I apply for an interest based loan. Even if this is not permissible than should I go back to Pakistan(my home country)if I am not able to pay tuition fee. If I go back without completing studies than I will have to sacrifice all the time and money I spent in studying pervious semesters.\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nIt is permissible for you to seek employment at the gas station and\nconvenience store. Your income will be Halaal.\n\nHowever, you should abstain from dealing with the Haraam items, lottery\ntickets, etc. if possible.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nFATWA DEPT."
