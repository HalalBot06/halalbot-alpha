  "answer": "QUESTION\nmy cousin married a shiah man,now she is coming to visit us this summer,may you guide me the way i should act with her? is it permissible for me to receive her and her husband and children in my home?is nikah correct according to the shari'ah? should i keep relation with her or not\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\n\nAll Shi’as are not declared non-Muslims. If you are unaware of his true beliefs, give her the benefit of the doubt and regard her Nikah as valid.\n\nHowever, if you do become aware of his Kufr beliefs, you should advise your cousin about the invalidity of her Nikah. You should utilize this opportunity to advise her to the best of your ability. If you feel that maintaining a good relationship with her will bring her onto the straight path, you may receive them in your home and maintain a favourable relationship with her and her family.\n\nHowever, if you are confident that she will not mend her ways, you may sever relationship with her – as a form of showing your dislike towards her actions.\n\nand Allah Ta'ala Knows Best\n\n \n\nMufti Muhammad Kadwa\nFATWA DEPT.\n\nCHECKED AND APPROVED: Mufti Ebrahim Desai"
