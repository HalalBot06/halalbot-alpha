  "answer": "QUESTION\nwhat R s right things 2 do in pregnancy? Names? its fashionable 2 follow Americans in having 2 or 3 names. is this ok? who names baby?\nANSWER\n\n\nShare:\nPREGNANCY%0D%0AAfter some time has elapsed, the couple desire that Allah Taa'la bless them%0D%0Awith a child and thus through marital consummation Allah Taa'la grants their%0D%0Awish. The first stage that follows is that of pregnancy. A person should not%0D%0Abe ashamed of being pregnant or treat it as a big burden, as there are many%0D%0Abeautiful virtues and rewards for being pregnant.%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said: \"The woman that dies in her%0D%0Avirginity or during her pregnancy or at the time of birth or thereafter (in%0D%0Anifaas) will attain the rank of a martyr\".%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is mentioned in another Hadith that Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi%0D%0Awasallam) said: \"Does it not please you (O Women!) that when you conceive%0D%0Afrom your husbands while he is pleased with you then that woman will receive%0D%0Asuch reward equal to that of a fasting person in the path of Allah and%0D%0Aspending the night in ibaadat. When her labour pains commence the%0D%0Ainhabitants of the earth and the sky are unaware of the stores of comfort%0D%0Athat are prepared for her. When she delivers and breast feeds her child then%0D%0Ashe will be granted a reward for every gulp of milk, and if she had to%0D%0Aremain awake during the night for the sake of her child, she will receive%0D%0Athe reward of emancipating seventy slaves in the path of Allah. O Salaamat!%0D%0ADo you know who these women are? They are pious, upright, delicately natured%0D%0Abut yet are obedient to their husbands and not ungrateful to them\".%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said: \"A woman from her pregnancy%0D%0Atill the time of weaning her child is like one protecting the boundaries of%0D%0Athe Islamic state. If she passes away during this period she attains the%0D%0Areward of martyrdom.\"%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another Hadith it is mentioned that \"The woman who dies of labour pains%0D%0Ais regarded as a martyr (shaheedah).\"%0D%0A%0D%0AA woman should therefore gladly bear these difficulties patiently and calmly%0D%0Aas she will be highly rewarded.%0D%0A%0D%0AHazrat Mail bin Yasaar (radiyallahu anhu) narrates that Rasulullah%0D%0A(Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said: \"Marry such women who are loving and%0D%0Aproduce children (in abundance) because (on the day of Qiyaamah) I will vie%0D%0Awith other Ummats and be proud of your numbers\".%0D%0A%0D%0AIn another Hadith Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said: \"Even the%0D%0Amiscarried foetus will drag its mother towards Jannat if she exercised%0D%0Apatience with the hope of acquiring reward\".%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said: \"When the woman breast feeds%0D%0Athen on every gulp of milk the child receives the reward is as though she%0D%0Ahas granted life to a being and when she weans her child then the angels pat%0D%0Aher on her back saying: CONGRATULATIONS! all your past sins have been%0D%0Aforgiven, now start all over again\".%0D%0A%0D%0A(By sins is intended the minor sins, this is also a great reward.)%0D%0A%0D%0ADAYS OF PREGNANCY%0D%0ADuring this time great care and precautions should be adopted. During this%0D%0Astage, any physical weaknesses affect the growth of the child. In the early%0D%0Adays of pregnancy, constipation should be avoided as there is a fear of%0D%0Amiscarriage. Constipation is a fairly common complaint during pregnancy.%0D%0AStimulant laxatives should be avoided in pregnancy and while breast-feeding.%0D%0ASimilarly diarrhoea should be avoided as this can make her weak and at times%0D%0Acan result in a miscarriage.%0D%0A%0D%0ADuring this period nausea, vomiting and discomposure is experienced. This%0D%0Ainduces a desire for sour and salty foods. Some women have a sudden craving%0D%0Afor black soil and soap etc. Caution should be taken that no such items are%0D%0Aconsumed which are detrimental to the health. Also extremely bitter and%0D%0Aspicy foods should be avoided. During pregnancy simple foods should be eaten%0D%0Athat assist in digestion.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf during the days of pregnancy any sickness befalls you, then immediate%0D%0Atreatment should be given and the doctor should be told of your pregnancy.%0D%0AOne should not feel ashamed of being pregnant. Those women who have their%0D%0Afirst pregnancy are ashamed to tell their in-laws and relatives and as a%0D%0Aresult they suffer.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe pregnant woman should remember that giving birth to a normal child does%0D%0Anot lead to so much of weakness as in the case of a miscarriage. Therefore%0D%0Aif one has a miscarriage, full precautions should be taken or else this%0D%0Aweakness will affect her for the rest of her life.%0D%0A%0D%0ADuring the early days of pregnancy, very heavy things should not be carried%0D%0Aor lifted. Likewise jumping from a high place, hopping, running or any form%0D%0Aof physical (pain) strain should be prevented as this may cause excessive%0D%0Ableeding or even a miscarriage.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe Islamic education of the child starts when the child is still in the%0D%0Awomb of the mother. This is through the thoughts that she carries in those%0D%0Adays, by the feelings that she has, by the kind of books that she reads, by%0D%0Athe kind of company that she keeps and by the kind of things that she hears.%0D%0A%0D%0ADuring pregnancy frightening pictures of deformed children or animals should%0D%0Anot be seen. One should look at beautiful children, flowers and should smell%0D%0Abeautiful fragrances.%0D%0A%0D%0AAlso during pregnancy reading evil books, having evil thoughts, bad%0D%0Aintentions, practising of bad habits and doing sinful works should be%0D%0Aavoided or else there is a fear that these evils may effect the unborn child%0D%0Alater on. All these have an effect on the unborn child because the mother's%0D%0Anervous system is affecting all the systems of the baby. Although the baby%0D%0Ahas its own independent systems, remember it is the mother's womb that is%0D%0Acarrying the baby and that the baby is being affected by whatever she is%0D%0Athinking, feeling, reading and listening to. It is better and advisable for%0D%0Athe mother to keep good company, to read good books (the Quraan Shareef%0D%0Ashould be read in abundance) and to be at such places where she hears the%0D%0Awords of Allah and about our DEEN. It is important to have good feelings,%0D%0Agood thoughts and not to carry grudges, have fear of something or be unduly%0D%0Aworried about something. One should always remain calm and happy and should%0D%0Anot be allowed to be over concerned and allow oneself to be overtaken by%0D%0Agrief. The thoughts that you generate within yourself will influence the%0D%0Akind of disposition the child will have. If you are sad and miserable the%0D%0Achild will be equally affected. So remember the environment prior to the%0D%0Achild's birth is as important as the environment he is born into.%0D%0A%0D%0AWHAT TO READ DURING PREGNANCY%0D%0ADuring the days of pregnancy, duas for the protection from calamities should%0D%0Abe read in abundance. Also the performance of Salaat regularly is a%0D%0Aprotection from calamities. The following duas and surahs should be read in%0D%0Aabundance during pregnancy:%0D%0A%0D%0AA'oodhu bikalimmatillaahit taammmaati min sharri maa khalaqa%0D%0AI seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of that which He%0D%0Ahas created.%0D%0A%0D%0AHasbunallaahu wa ni'imal wakeel%0D%0AAllah suffices us and He is the best guardian%0D%0A%0D%0AInniy u'eedhuhaa bika wa dhurriyyatahaa minas shaytaanir rajeem%0D%0AAnd I command her and her offspring to Thy protection, from the evil one,%0D%0Athe rejected.%0D%0A%0D%0AAayatul Kursi, surah Yaseen, surah Maryam, surah Yusuf and surah Muhammad%0D%0A%0D%0AAlso it is mentioned that Hazrat Fatima (radiyallahu anha) reports that when%0D%0Ait was time for her to deliver her child, Rasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi%0D%0Awasallam) sent Umme Salma (radiyallahu anha) and Hazrat Zainab (radiyallahu%0D%0Aanha) to me with the instruction that they read Aayatul Kursi, surah%0D%0AAl-Falaq and An-naas and the following verse for easy delivery:%0D%0A%0D%0AInna rabbakumullaahul ladhiy khalaqas samaawaati wal ardha fiy sittati%0D%0Aayyaamin thumma-stawaa alal arsh, yughshiyl llaylan nahaara wa yatlubuhoo%0D%0Ahatheethan was shamsa wal qamara wan nujooma musakh-kharaatim bi amrihi.%0D%0AAlaa lahul khalqu wal amru, tabaaraka llaahu rabbul aalameen. Ud'oo rabbakum%0D%0Atadharru'an wa khufyatan, innahoo laa yuhibbul mu'tadeen%0D%0ASurah Al-A'raf (7:54,55)%0D%0A%0D%0AIf a woman has difficulty during childbirth, the following should be written%0D%0Aon paper, wrapped in a piece of white cloth and tied around her left thigh.%0D%0AInsha-Allah it will ease the birth.%0D%0A%0D%0AAlso Aayatul -Kursi and the two Ayats from surah Al-A'raf (7: 54,55) are to%0D%0Abe recited near the woman in throes of birth. Surah Al-Falaq and An-Naas are%0D%0Aalso to be read and thereafter blown on her%0D%0A%0D%0ACERTAIN BEAUTIFUL NAMES OF ALLAH TO BE READ BEFORE AND DURING PREGNANCY%0D%0A%0D%0AYaa waahidul ahad%0D%0AThe ONE Un-Equalled%0D%0AAnyone desiring good and pious children should inscribe this ism on paper,%0D%0Aor cloth and keep it with him at all times.%0D%0A%0D%0AYaa awwalu%0D%0AThe First.%0D%0AAnyone desirous of male children should say this ism 40 times daily for 40%0D%0Adays. His needs will soon be fulfilled.(Insha-Allah)%0D%0A%0D%0AYaa mubdi-u%0D%0AThe Originator%0D%0AAnyone who, while placing his hand on the stomach of his pregnant wife,%0D%0Arepeats this ism 99 times at the time of sehri, neither will she have a%0D%0Amiscarriage nor will she give birth prematurely, Insha-Allah)%0D%0A%0D%0AYaa barru%0D%0AThe Good.%0D%0Aanyone who reads this ism 7 times and blows on his child soon after birth,%0D%0AAllah will grant the child protection from calamities until puberty.%0D%0A(Insha-Allah)%0D%0A%0D%0AYaa baari-u%0D%0AOne Who Gives Life.%0D%0AIf a barren woman fasts for 7days and each day, after making Iftaar with%0D%0Awater, reads this ism 21 times Allah will grant her male children.%0D%0A(Insha-Allah)%0D%0A%0D%0AYaa musawwiru%0D%0AFashioner of Shapes.%0D%0AIf a barren woman fasts and each day, after making Iftaar with water read%0D%0Athis ism 21 times Allah will grant her male children. (Insha-Allah%0D%0A%0D%0AYaa naafi-u%0D%0AOne Who Confers Benefits.%0D%0AIf this ism is said prior to having intercourse, Allah will grant him good%0D%0Aand pious children. (Insha-Allah)%0D%0A%0D%0AFASTING DURING PREGNANCY%0D%0AIf the pregnant woman is certain or almost certain that if she fasts the%0D%0Afoetus will be harmed or she herself will be harmed, she is then permitted%0D%0Anot to observe the fasts.%0D%0A%0D%0AIf a woman comes to know after having had the intention of the fast that she%0D%0Ais pregnant and she is almost certain that fasting would be harmful for her,%0D%0Ashe is then permitted to break the fast and observe it on another day%0D%0Awithout expiation.%0D%0A%0D%0AWHAT TO EAT DURING PREGNANCY%0D%0ADuring the days of pregnancy good and pure foods are essential for the%0D%0Ahealth of the child. But excess of healthy foods and fruits and too much of%0D%0Aresting causes the weight of the child to increase due to which delivery%0D%0Abecomes difficult. Therefore excess of healthy foods should not be consumed,%0D%0Anor should there be too much of resting. A little bit of work should be%0D%0Adone.%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said: \"If a woman eats sweet melon,%0D%0Ashe will give birth to a handsome and pretty child\".%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is interesting to note that an intelligent child is born when a pregnant%0D%0Awoman eats beans. Also it increases the mother's milk.%0D%0A%0D%0ADuring the days of pregnancy by eating coconut and sugar candy, it lessens%0D%0Athe amount of vomiting. There is easiness at the time of the birth of the%0D%0Achild. Also on the body of the child there would be no heat rashes and the%0D%0Achild will be fair and pure (skin) and the child will be born healthy.%0D%0A(Insha-Allah)%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) has emphasised the importance of%0D%0Adates and their effectiveness in the growth of the foetus. He (Sallallahu%0D%0Aalayhi wasallam) recommended that they be given to women. Sayyidah Maryam%0D%0A(alayhas salaam) had dates as her food during her confinement and labour.%0D%0AExperiments have shown that dates contain stimulants which strengthen the%0D%0Amuscles of the uterus in the last months of pregnancy. This helps the%0D%0Adilation of the uterus at the time of delivery on one hand and reduces the%0D%0Ableeding after delivery on the other. Dates enrich the breast milk with all%0D%0Athe elements needed to make the child healthy and resistant to disease.%0D%0AModern Science has proved that dates are a part of a healthy diet. They%0D%0Acontain sugar, fat and proteins as well as important vitamins. They are also%0D%0Arich in natural fibres. Medical research has proven that they are effective%0D%0Ain preventing stomach cancer. Dates also surpass other fruit in sheer%0D%0Avariety of their constituents. They contain oil, Calcium, Sulphur, Iron,%0D%0APotassium, Phosphorous, Manganese, Copper and Megnesium. In other words, one%0D%0Adate is a mini-mine of a balanced and healthy diet.%0D%0A%0D%0ARasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said that%0D%0Abitter orange (grapefruit) is a cure for all illnesses. Also, it increases%0D%0Athe milk in the mother's breast.%0D%0A%0D%0A[ extract - Upbringing of Children, Moulana Moosa ibn Ahmad Olgar ]"
