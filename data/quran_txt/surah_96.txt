96:6107 READ in the name of thy Sustainer, who has-
96:6108 created man out of a germ-cell
96:6109 Read - for thy Sustainer is the Most Bountiful One
96:6110 who has taught [man] the use of the pen –
96:6111 taught man what he did not know!
96:6112 Nay, verily, man becomes grossly overweening
96:6113 whenever he believes himself to be self-sufficient:
96:6114 for, behold, unto thy Sustainer all must return.
96:6115 HAST THOU ever considered him who tries to prevent
96:6116 a servant [of God] from praying?
96:6117 Hast thou considered whether he is on the right way,
96:6118 or is concerned with God-consciousness?
96:6119 Hast thou considered whether he may [not] be giving the lie to the truth and turning his back [upon it]?
96:6120 Does he, then, not know that God sees [all]?
96:6121 Nay, if he desist not, We shall most surely drag him down upon his forehead
96:6122 the lying, rebellious forehead! –
96:6123 and then let him summon [to his aid] the counsels of his own [spurious] wisdom,
96:6124 [the while] We shall summon the forces of heavenly chastisement!
96:6125 Nay, pay thou no heed to him, but prostrate thyself [before God] and draw close [unto Him]!
