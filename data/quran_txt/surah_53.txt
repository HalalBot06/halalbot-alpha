53:4785 CONSIDER this unfolding [of God’s message], as it comes down from on high!
53:4786 This fellow-man of yours has not gone astray, nor is he deluded,
53:4787 and neither does he speak out of his own desire:
53:4788 that [which he conveys to you] is but [a divine] inspiration with which he is being inspired –
53:4789 something that a very mighty one has imparted to him:
53:4790 [an angel] endowed with sur­passing power, who in time manifested himself in his true shape and nature,
53:4791 appearing in the horizon’s loftiest part,
53:4792 and then drew near, and came close,
53:4793 until he was but two bow-lengths away, or even nearer.
53:4794 And thus did [God] reveal unto His servant whatever He deemed right to reveal.
53:4795 The [servant’s] heart did not give the lie to what he saw:
53:4796 will you, then, contend with him as to what he saw?
53:4797 And, indeed, he saw him a second time
53:4798 by the lote-tree of the farthest limit,
53:4799 near unto the garden of promise.
53:4800 with the lote-tree veiled in a veil of nameless splendour….
53:4801 [And withal,] the eye did not waver, nor yet did it stray:
53:4802 truly did he see some of the most profound of his Sustainer’s symbols.
53:4803 HAVE YOU, then, ever considered [what you are worshipping in] Al-Lat and Al-Uzza,
53:4804 as well as [in] Manat, the third and last [of this triad]?
53:4805 Why - for yourselves [you would choose only] male offspring, whereas to Him [you assign] female:
53:4806 that, lo and behold, is an unfair division!
53:4807 These [allegedly divine beings] are nothing but empty names which you have invented - you and your forefathers - [and] for which God has bestowed no warrant from on high. They [who worship them] follow nothing but surmise and their own wishful thinking - although right guidance has now indeed come unto them from their Sustainer.
53:4808 Does man imagine that it is his due to have all that he might wish for,
53:4809 despite the fact that [both] the life to come and this present [one] belong to God [alone]?
53:4810 For, however many angels there be in the heavens, their intercession can be of no least avail [to anyone] - except after God has given leave [to inter­cede] for whomever He wills and with whom He is well-pleased.
53:4811 Behold, it is [only] such as do not [really] believe in the life to come that regard the angels as female beings;
53:4812 and [since] they have no knowledge whatever thereof, they follow nothing but surmise: yet, behold, never can surmise take the place of truth.
53:4813 Avoid thou, therefore, those who turn away from all remembrance of Us and care for no more than the life of this world,
53:4814 which, to them, is the only thing worth knowing. Behold, thy Sustainer is fully aware as to who has strayed from His path, and fully aware is He as to who follows His guidance.
53:4815 Indeed, unto God belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth: and so He will reward those who do evil in accordance with what they did, and will reward those who do good with ultimate good.
53:4816 As for those who avoid the [truly] grave sins and shameful deeds - even though they may some­times stumble behold, thy Sustainer is abounding in forgiveness. He is fully aware of you when He brings you into being out of dust, and when you are still hidden in your mothers’ wombs: do not, then, consider your­selves pure - [for] He knows best as to who is conscious of Him.
53:4817 HAST THOU, then, ever considered him who turns away [from remembering Us, and cares for no more than the life of this world],
53:4818 and gives so little [of himself for the good of his soul], and so grudgingly?
53:4819 Does he [claim to] have knowledge of some­thing that is beyond the reach of human perception, so that he can see [it clearly]?
53:4820 Or has he never yet been told of what was [said] in the revelations of Moses,
53:4821 and of Abra­ham, who to his trust was true:
53:4822 that no bearer of burdens shall be made to bear another’s burden;
53:4823 and that nought shall be accounted unto man but what he is striving for;
53:4824 and that in time [the nature of] all his striving will be shown [to him in its true light],
53:4825 where­upon he shall be requited for it with the fullest requital;
53:4826 and that with thy Sustainer is the beginning and the end [of all that exists];
53:4827 and that it is He alone who causes [you] to laugh and to weep;
53:4828 and that it is He alone who deals death and grants life;
53:4829 and that it is He who creates the two kinds - the male and the female –
53:4830 out of a [mere] drop of sperm as it is poured forth,
53:4831 and that [therefore] it is within His power to bring about a second life;
53:4832 and that it is He alone who frees from want and causes to possess;
53:4833 and that it is He alone who sustains the bright­est star;
53:4834 and that it is He who destroyed the ancient [tribes of] Ad
53:4835 and Thamud, leaving no trace [of them],
53:4836 as well as the people of Noah before them - [since,] verily, they all had been most willful in their evildoing and most overweening –
53:4837 just as He thrust into perdition those cities that were overthrown
53:4838 and then covered them from sight forever.
53:4839 About which, then, of thy Sustainer’s powers canst thou [still] remain in doubt?
53:4840 THIS IS a warning like those warnings of old:
53:4841 that [Last Hour] which is so near draws ever nearer,
53:4842 [although] none but God can unveil it....
53:4843 Do you, perchance, find this tiding strange?
53:4844 And do you laugh instead of weeping,
53:4845 and divert yourselves all the while?
53:4846 [Nay,] but prostrate yourselves before God, and worship [Him alone]!
