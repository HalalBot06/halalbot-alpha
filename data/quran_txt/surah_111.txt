111:6217 DOOMED are the hands of him of the glowing countence: and doomed is he!
111:6218 What will his wealth avail him, and all that he has gained?
111:6219 [In the life to come] he shall have to endure a fire fiercely glowing;
111:6220 together with his wife, that carrier of evil tales,
111:6221 [who bears] around her neck a rope of twisted strands!
