91:6044 CONSIDER the sun and its radiant brightness,
91:6045 and the moon as it reflects the sun!
91:6046 Consider the day as it reveals the world,
91:6047 and the night as it veils it darkly!
91:6048 Consider the sky and its wondrous make,
91:6049 and the earth and all its expanse!
91:6050 Consider the human self, and how it is formed in accordance with what it is meant to be,
91:6051 and how it is imbued with moral failings as well as with consciousness of God!
91:6052 To a happy state shall indeed attain he who causes this [self] to grow in purity,
91:6053 and truly lost is he who buries it [in darkness].
91:6054 TO [THIS] TRUTH gave the lie, in their overweening arrogance, [the tribe of] Thamud,
91:6055 when that most hapless wretch from among them rushed forward [to commit his evil deed],
91:6056 although God's apostle had told them, "It is a she-camel belonging to God, so let her drink [and do her no harm]!"
91:6057 But they gave him the lie, and cruelly slaughtered her - whereupon their Sustainer visited them with utter destruction for this their sin, destroying them all alike:
91:6058 for none [of them] had any fear of what might befall them.
