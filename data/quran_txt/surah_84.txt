84:5885 WHEN THE SKY is split asunder,
84:5886 obeying its Sustainer, as in truth it must;
84:5887 and when the earth is leveled,
84:5888 and casts forth whatever is in it, and becomes utterly void,
84:5889 obeying its Sustainer, as in truth it must -:
84:5890 [then,] O man - thou [that] hast, verily, been toiling towards thy Sustainer in painful toil - then shalt thou meet Him!
84:5891 And as for him whose record shall be placed in his right hand,
84:5892 he will in time be called to account with an easy accounting,
84:5893 and will [be able to] turn joyfully to those of his own kind.
84:5894 But as for him whose record shall be given to him behind his back;
84:5895 he will in time pray for utter destruction:
84:5896 but he will enter the blazing flame.
84:5897 Behold, [in his earthly life] he lived joyfully among people of his own kind
84:5898 for, behold, he never thought that he would have to return [to God].
84:5899 Yea indeed! His Sustainer did see all that was in him!
84:5900 BUT NAY! I call to witness the sunset's [fleeting] afterglow,
84:5901 and the night, and what it [step by step] unfolds,
84:5902 and the moon, as it grows to its fullness:
84:5903 [even thus, O men,] are you bound to move; onward from stage to stage.
84:5904 What, then, is amiss with them that they will not believe [in a life to come]?
84:5905 and [that], when the Qur’an is read unto them, they do not fall down in prostration?
84:5906 Nay, but they who are bent on denying the truth give the lie [to this divine writ]!
84:5907 Yet God has full knowledge of what they conceal [in their hearts].
84:5908 Hence, give them the tiding of grievous suffering [in the life to come] –
84:5909 unless it be such [of them] as [repent, and] attain to faith, and do good works: for theirs shall be a reward unending!.
