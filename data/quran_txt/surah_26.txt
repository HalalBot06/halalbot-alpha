26:2933 Ta. Sin, Mim.
26:2934 THESE ARE MESSAGES of the divine writ, clear in itself and clearly showing the truth!
26:2935 Wouldst thou, perhaps, torment thyself to death [with grief] because they [who live around thee] refuse to believe [in it]?
26:2936 Had We so willed, We could have sent down unto them a message from the skies, so that their necks would [be forced to] bow down before it in humility.
26:2937 [But We have not willed it:] and so, whenever there comes unto them any fresh reminder from the Most Gracious, they [who are blind of heart] always - turn their backs upon it:
26:2938 thus, indeed, have they given the lie (to this message as well). But [in time] they will come to understand what it was that they were wont to deride!
26:2939 Have they, then, never considered the earth - how much of every noble kind [of life] We have caused to grow thereon?
26:2940 In this, behold, there is a message [unto men], even though most of them will not believe [in it].
26:2941 But, verily, thy Sustainer - He alone - is almighty, a dispenser of grace!
26:2942 HENCE, [remember how it was] when thy Sustainer summoned Moses: “Go unto those evil doing people.
26:2943 the people of Pharaoh, who refuse to be con­scious of Me!”
26:2944 He answered: “O my Sustainer! Behold, I fear that they will give me the lie,
26:2945 and then my breast will be straitened and my tongue will not be free: send, then, [this Thy command] to Aaron.
26:2946 Moreover, they keep a grave charge [pending] against me, and I fear that they will slay me.”
26:2947 Said He: “Not so, indeed! Go forth, then, both of you, with Our messages: verify, We shall be with you, listening [to your call]!
26:2948 And go, both of you, unto Pharaoh and say, ‘Behold, we bear a message from the Sustainer of all the worlds:
26:2949 Let the children of Israel go with us!’”
26:2950 [But when Moses had delivered his message, Pharaoh] said: “Did we not bring thee up among us when thou wert a child? And didst thou not spend among us years of thy [later] life?
26:2951 And yet thou didst commit that [heinous] deed of thine, and [hast thus shown that] thou art one of the ingrate!”
26:2952 Replied [Moses]: “I committed it while I was still going astray;
26:2953 and I fled from you because I feared you. But [since] then my Sustainer has endowed me with the ability to judge [between right and wrong], and has made me one of [His] message-­bearers.
26:2954 And [as for] that favour of which thou so tauntingly remindest me - [was it not] due to thy having enslaved the children of Israel?”
26:2955 Said Pharaoh: “And what [and who] is that ‘Sustainer of all the worlds’?”
26:2956 [Moses] answered: “[He is] the Sustainer of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them: if you would but [allow yourselves to] be convinced!”
26:2957 Said [Pharaoh] unto those around him: “Did you hear [what he said]?”
26:2958 [And Moses] continued: “[He is] your Sus­tainer, [too,] as well as the Sustainer of your fore­fathers of old!”
26:2959 [Pharaoh] exclaimed: “Behold, [this] your ‘apostle’ who [claims that he] has been sent unto you is mad indeed!
26:2960 [But Moses] went on: “[He of whom I speak is] the Sustainer of the east and the west and of all that is between the two”- as you would know] if you would but use your reason!”
26:2961 Said [Pharaoh]: “Indeed, if thou choose to worship any deity other than me, I shall most cer­tainly throw thee into prison!
26:2962 Said he: “Even if I should bring about before thee something that clearly shows the truth?”
26:2963 [Pharaoh] answered: “Produce it, then, if thou art a man of truth!”
26:2964 Thereupon [Moses] threw down his staff - and lo! it was a serpent, plainly visible;
26:2965 and he drew forth his hand - and lo! it appeared [shining] white to the beholders.
26:2966 Said [pharaoh] unto the great ones around him: “Verily, this is indeed a sorcerer of great knowledge
26:2967 who wants to drive you out of your land by his sorcery. What, then, do you advise?”
26:2968 They answered: “Let him and his brother wait a while, and send unto all cities heralds
26:2969 who shall assemble before thee all sorcerers of great knowl­edge”
26:2970 And so the sorcerers were assembled at a set time on a certain day,
26:2971 and the people were asked: Are you all present,
26:2972 so that we might follow [in the footsteps of] the sorcerers if it is they who prevail?”
26:2973 Now when the sorcerers came, they said unto Pharaoh: “Verily, we ought to have a great reward if it is we who prevail.
26:2974 Answered he: “Yea - and, verily, in that case you shall be among those who are near unto me.
26:2975 [And] Moses said unto them: “Throw whatever you are going to throw!”
26:2976 Thereupon they threw their [magic ropes and their staffs, and said: “By Pharaoh’s might, behold, it is we indeed who have prevailed!”
26:2977 [But] then Moses threw his staff - and lo! it swallowed up all their deceptions.
26:2978 And down fell the sorcerers, prostrating them­selves in adoration,
26:2979 [and] exclaimed: “We have come to believe in the Sustainer of all the worlds,
26:2980 the Sustainer of Moses and Aaron!”
26:2981 Said [Pharaoh]: “Have you come to believe in him ere I have given you permission? Verily, he must be your master who has taught you magic! But in time you shall come to know [my revenge]: most certainly shall I cut off your hands and your feet in great numbers, because of [your] perverseness, and shall most certainly crucify you in great numbers, all together!”
26:2982 They answered: “No harm [canst thou do to us]: verily, unto our Sustainer do we turn!
26:2983 Behold, we [but] ardently desire that our Sustainer forgive us our faults in return for our having been foremost among the believers!”
26:2984 AND [there came a time when] We inspired Moses thus: “Go forth with My servants by night: for, behold, you will he pursued!”
26:2985 And Pharaoh sent heralds unto all cities,
26:2986 [bidding them to call out his troops and to proclaim:] “Behold, these [children of Israel] are but a contemptible band;
26:2987 but they are indeed filled with hatred of us
26:2988 seeing that we are, verily, a nation united, fully prepared against danger –
26:2989 and so we have [rightly] driven them out of [their] gardens and springs,
26:2990 and [deprived them of their erstwhile] station of honour!”
26:2991 Thus it was: but [in the course of time] We were to bestow all these [things] as a heritage on the children of Israel.
26:2992 And so [the Egyptians] caught up with them at sunrise;
26:2993 and as soon as the two hosts came in sight of one another, the followers of Moses exclaimed: “Behold, we shall certainly be overtaken [and defeated]!”
26:2994 He replied: Nay indeed! My Sustainer is with me, [and] He will guide me!”
26:2995 Thereupon We inspired Moses thus: Strike the sea with thy staff!”- whereupon it parted, and each part appeared like a mountain vast.
26:2996 And We caused the pursuers to draw near unto that place:
26:2997 and We saved Moses and all who were with him,
26:2998 and then We caused the others to drown.
26:2999 In this [story] behold, there is a message [unto all men], even though most of them will not believe [in it].
26:3000 And yet, verily, thy Sustainer - He alone - is almighty, a dispenser of grace!
26:3001 And convey unto them the story of Abraham –
26:3002 [how it was] when he asked his father and his people, “What is it that you worship?”
26:3003 They answered: We worship idols, and we remain ever devoted to them.”
26:3004 Said he: “Do [you really think that] they hear you when you invoke them,
26:3005 or benefit you or do you harm?”
26:3006 They exclaimed: But we found our fore­fathers doing the same!”
26:3007 Said [Abraham]: “Have you, then, ever con­sidered what it is that you have been worshipping
26:3008 you and those ancient forebears of yours?
26:3009 “Now [as for me, I know that,] verily, these [false deities] are my enemies, [and that none is my helper] save the Sustainer of all the worlds,
26:3010 who has created me and is the One who guides me,
26:3011 and is the One who gives me to eat and to drink,
26:3012 and when I fall ill, is the One who restores me to health,
26:3013 and who will cause me to die and then will bring me back to life –
26:3014 and who, [hope, will forgive me my faults on Judgment Day!
26:3015 “O my Sustainer! Endow me with the ability to judge [between right and wrong], and make me one with the righteous,
26:3016 and grant me the power to convey the truth unto those who will come after me,
26:3017 and place me among those who shall inherit the garden of bliss!
26:3018 “And forgive my father - for, verily, he is among those who have gone astray –
26:3019 and do not put me to shame on the Day when all shall be raised from the dead:
26:3020 the Day on which neither wealth will be of any use, nor children,
26:3021 [and when] only he [will be happy] who comes before God with a heart free of evil!”
26:3022 For, [on that Day,] paradise will be brought within sight of the God-conscious,
26:3023 whereas the blazing fire will be laid open before those who had been lost in grievous error;
26:3024 and they will be asked: “Where now is all that you were wont to worship
26:3025 instead of God? Can these [things and beings] be of any help to you or to themselves?”
26:3026 Thereupon they will be hurled into hell – they, as well as all [others] who had been lost in grievous error,
26:3027 and the hosts of Iblis - all together.
26:3028 And there and then, blaming one another, they [who had grievously sinned in life] will exclaim:
26:3029 “By God, we were most obviously astray
26:3030 when we deemed you [false deities] equal to the Sustainer of all the worlds –
26:3031 yet they who have seduced us [into believing in you] are the truly guilty ones!
26:3032 And now we have none to intercede for us,
26:3033 nor any loving friend.
26:3034 Would that we had a second chance [in life], so that we could be among the believers!”
26:3035 In all this, behold, there is a message [unto men], even though most of them will not believe [in it].
26:3036 But, verily, thy Sustainer - He alone - is almighty, a dispenser of grace!
26:3037 The people of Noah [too] gave the lie to [one of God’s] message-bearers
26:3038 when their brother Noah said unto them: “Will you not be conscious of God?
26:3039 Behold, I am an apostle [sent by Him] to you, [and therefore] worthy of your trust:
26:3040 be, then, conscious of God, and pay heed unto me!
26:3041 “And no reward whatever do I ask of you for it: my reward rests with none but the Sustainer of all the worlds.
26:3042 Hence, remain conscious of God, and pay heed unto me!”
26:3043 They answered: “Shall we place our faith in thee, even though [only] the most abject [of people] follow thee?”
26:3044 Said he: “And what knowledge could I have as to what they were doing [before they came to me]?
26:3045 Their reckoning rests with none but my Sus­tainer: if you could but understand [this]!
26:3046 Hence, I shall not drive away [any of] those [who profess to be] believers;
26:3047 I am nothing but a plain warner.”
26:3048 Said they: “Indeed, if thou desist not, O Noah, thou wilt surely be stoned to death!”
26:3049 [Whereupon] he prayed: “O my Sustainer! Behold, my people have given me the lie:
26:3050 hence, lay Thou wide open the truth between me and them, and save me and those of the believers who are with me!”
26:3051 And so We saved him and those [who were] with him in the fully-laden ark,
26:3052 and then We caused those who stayed behind to drown.
26:3053 In this [story], behold, there is a message [unto men], even though most of them will not believe [in it].
26:3054 But, verily, thy Sustainer - He alone - is almighty, a dispenser of grace
26:3055 [AND the tribe of] Ad gave the lie to [one of God’s] message-bearers
26:3056 when their brother Hud said unto them: “Will you not be conscious of God?
26:3057 Behold, I am an apostle [sent by Him] to you, [and therefore] worthy of your trust:
26:3058 be, then, con­scious of God, and pay heed unto me!
26:3059 “And no reward whatever do I ask of you for it: my reward rests with none but the Sustainer of all the worlds.
26:3060 “Will you, in your wanton folly, build [idola­trous] altars on every height,
26:3061 and make for yourselves mighty castles, [hoping] that you might become immortal?
26:3062 And will you [always], whenever you lay hand [on others], lay hand [on them] cruelly, without any restraint?
26:3063 “Be, then, conscious of God and pay heed unto me:
26:3064 and [thus] be conscious of Him who has [so] amply provided you with all [the good] that you might think of
26:3065 amply provided you with flocks, and children,
26:3066 and gardens, and springs -:
26:3067 for, verily, I fear lest suffering befall you on an awesome day!”
26:3068 [But] they answered. “It is all one to us whether thou preachest [something new] or art not of those who [like to] preach.
26:3069 This [religion of ours] is none other than that to which our forebears clung,
26:3070 and we are not going to be chastised [for adhering to it]!”
26:3071 And so they gave him the lie: and thereupon We destroyed them. In this [story], behold, there is a message [unto men], even though most of them will not believe [in it].
26:3072 But, verily, thy Sustainer - He alone - is almighty, a dispenser of grace!
26:3073 [AND the tribe of] Thamud gave the lie to [one of God’s] message-hearers
26:3074 when their brother Salih said unto them: “Will you not be conscious of God?
26:3075 Behold, I am an apostle [sent by Him] to you, [and therefore] worthy of your trust:
26:3076 be, then, conscious of God, and pay heed unto me!
26:3077 “And no reward whatever do I ask of you for it: my reward rests with none but the Sustainer of all the worlds.
26:3078 “Do you think that you will be left secure [forever] in the midst of what you have here and now?
26:3079 amidst [these] gardens and springs
26:3080 and fields, and [these] palm-trees with slender spathes? –
26:3081 and that you will [always be able to] hew dwellings out of the mountains with [the same] great skill?”
26:3082 “Be, then, conscious of God, and pay heed unto me,
26:3083 and pay no heed to the counsel of those who are given to excesses –
26:3084 those who spread corruption on earth instead of setting things to rights!”
26:3085 Said they: “Thou art but one of the be­witched!
26:3086 Thou art nothing but a mortal like our­selves! Come, then, forward with a token [of thy mission] if thou art a man of truth!”
26:3087 Replied he: “This she-camel shall have a share of water, and you shall have a share of water, on the days appointed [therefor];
26:3088 and do her no harm, lest suffering befall you on an awesome day!”
26:3089 But they cruelly slaughtered her - and then they had cause to regret it:
26:3090 for the suffering [predicted by Salih,] befell them [then and there]. In this [story], behold, there is a message [unto men], even though most of them will not believe [in it].
26:3091 But, verily, thy Sustainer - He alone – is almighty, a dispenser of grace!
26:3092 [AND] the people of Lot gave the lie to [one of God’s] message-bearers
26:3093 when their brother Lot said unto them: “Will you not be conscious of God?
26:3094 Behold, I am an apostle [sent by Him] to you, [and therefore] worthy of your trust:
26:3095 be, then, conscious of God, and pay heed unto me!
26:3096 “And no reward whatever do I ask of you for it: my reward rests with none but the Sustainer of all the worlds.
26:3097 “Must you, of all people, [lustfully] approach men,
26:3098 keeping yourselves aloof from all the [lawful] spouses whom your Sustainer has created for you? Nay, but you are people who transgress all bounds of what is right!”
26:3099 Said they: “Indeed, If thou desist not, O Lot, thou wilt most certainly be expelled [from this town­ship]!”
26:3100 [Lot] exclaimed: “Behold, I am one of those who utterly abhor your doings!”
26:3101 [And then he prayed:] “O my Sustainer! Save me and my household from all that they are doing!”
26:3102 Thereupon We saved him and all his household –
26:3103 all but an old woman, who was among those that stayed behind;
26:3104 and then We utterly destroyed the others,
26:3105 and rained down upon them a rain [of destruction]: and dire is such rain upon all who let themselves be warned [to no avail]!
26:3106 In this [story], behold, there is a message [unto men], even though most of them will not be­lieve [in it].
26:3107 But, verily, thy Sustainer - He alone - is almighty, a dispenser of grace!
26:3108 [AND] the dwellers of the wooded dales [of Madyan] gave the lie to [one of God’s] message-bearers
26:3109 when their brother Shu’ayb said unto them: “Will you not be conscious of God?
26:3110 Behold, I am an apostle [sent by Him] to you, [and therefore] worthy of your trust:
26:3111 be, then, conscious of God, and pay heed unto me!
26:3112 “And no reward whatever do I ask of you for it: my reward rests with none but the Sustainer of all the worlds.
26:3113 “[Always] give full measure, and be not among those who [unjustly] cause loss [to others];
26:3114 and [in all your dealings] weigh with a true balance,
26:3115 and do not deprive people of what is rightfully theirs; and do not act wickedly on earth by spreading corruption,
26:3116 but be conscious of Him who has created you, just as [He created] those countless generations of old!”
26:3117 Said they: “Thou art but one of the be­witched,
26:3118 for thou art nothing but a mortal like ourselves! And, behold, we think that thou art a consummate liar!
26:3119 Cause, then, fragments of the sky to fall down upon us, if thou art a man of truth!”
26:3120 Answered [Shu’ayb]: “My Sustainer knows fully well what you are doing.”
26:3121 But they gave him the lie. And thereupon suffering overtook them on a day dark with shadows: and, verily, it was the suffering of an awesome day!
26:3122 In this [story], behold, there is a message [unto men], even though most of them will not believe [in it].
26:3123 But, verily, thy Sustainer - He alone - is almighty, a dispenser of grace!
26:3124 Now, behold, this [divine writ] has indeed been bestowed from on high by the Sustainer of all the worlds:
26:3125 trustworthy divine inspiration has alighted with it from on high
26:3126 upon thy heart, [O Muhammad] so that thou mayest be among those who preach
26:3127 in the clear Arabic tongue.
26:3128 And, verily, [the essence of] this [revelation] is indeed found in the ancient books of divine wisdom [as well].
26:3129 Is it not evidence enough for them that [so many] learned men from among the children of Israel have recognized this [as true]?
26:3130 But [even] had We bestowed it from on high upon any of the non-Arabs,
26:3131 and had he recited it unto them [in his own tongue], they would not have believed in it.
26:3132 Thus have We caused this [message] to pass [unheeded] through the hearts of those who are lost in sin:
26:3133 they will not believe in it till they behold the grievous suffering
26:3134 that will come upon them [on resurrection,] all of a sudden, without their being aware [of its approach];
26:3135 and then they will exclaim, “Could we have a respite?”
26:3136 Do they, then, [really] wish that Our chas­tisement be hastened on?
26:3137 But hast thou ever considered [this]: If We do allow them to enjoy [this life] for some years,
26:3138 and thereupon that [chastisement] which they were promised befalls them –
26:3139 of what avail to them will be all their past enjoyments?
26:3140 And withal, never have We destroyed any community unless it had been warned
26:3141 and reminded: for, never do We wrong [anyone].
26:3142 And [this divine writ is such a reminder:] no evil spirits have brought it down:
26:3143 for, neither does it suit their ends, nor is it in their power [to impart it to man]:
26:3144 verily, [even] from hearing it are they utterly debarred!
26:3145 Hence, [O man,] do not invoke any other deity side by side with God, lest thou find thyself among those who are made to suffer [on Judgment Day].
26:3146 And warn [whomever thou canst reach, beginning with] thy kinsfolk,
26:3147 and spread the wings of thy tenderness over all of the believers who may follow thee;
26:3148 but if they disobey thee, say, “I am free of responsibility for aught that you may do!” –
26:3149 and place thy trust in the Almighty, the Dispenser of Grace,
26:3150 who sees thee when thou standest [alone],
26:3151 and [sees] thy behaviour among those who prostrate themselves [before Him]:
26:3152 for, verily, He alone is all-hearing, all-knowing!
26:3153 [And] shall I tell you upon whom it is that those evil spirits descend?
26:3154 They descend upon all sinful self-deceivers
26:3155 who readily lend ear [to every falsehood], and most of whom lie to others as well.
26:3156 And as for the poets [they, too, are prone to deceive themselves: and so, only] those who are lost in grievous error would follow them.
26:3157 Art thou not aware that they roam confusedly through all the valleys [of words and thoughts],
26:3158 and that they [so often] say what they do not do [or feel]?
26:3159 [Most of them are of this kind] save those who have attained to faith, and do righteous deeds, and remember God unceasingly, and defend them­selves [only] after having been wronged, and [trust in God’s promise that] those who are bent on wrong­doing will in time come to know how evil a turn their destinies are bound to take!
