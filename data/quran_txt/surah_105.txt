105:6189 ART THOU NOT aware of how thy Sustainer dealt with the Army of the Elephant?
105:6190 Did He not utterly confound their artful planning?
105:6191 Thus, He let loose upon them great swarms of flying creatures
105:6192 which smote them with stone-hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained,
105:6193 and caused them to become like a field of grain that has been eaten down to stubble
