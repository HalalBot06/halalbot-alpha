100:6147 Oh, the chargers that run panting,
100:6148 sparks of fire striking,
100:6149 rushing to assault at morn,
100:6150 thereby raising clouds of dust,
100:6151 thereby storming [blindly] into any host!
100:6152 VERILY, towards his Sustainer man is most ungrateful
100:6153 and to this, behold, he [himself] bears witness indeed:
100:6154 for, verily, to the love of wealth is he most ardently devoted.
100:6155 But does he not know that [on the Last Day,] when all that is in the graves is raised and brought out,
100:6156 and all that is [hidden] in men's hearts is bared
100:6157 that on that Day their Sustainer [will show that He] has always been fully aware of them?
