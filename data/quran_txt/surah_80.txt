80:5759 HE FROWNED and turned away
80:5760 because the blind man approached him!
80:5761 Yet for all thou didst know, [O Muhammad,] he might perhaps have grown in purity,
80:5762 or have been reminded [of the truth], and helped by this reminder.
80:5763 Now as for him who believes himself to be self-sufficient
80:5764 to him didst thou give thy whole attention,
80:5765 although thou art not accountable for his failure to attain to purity;
80:5766 but as for him who came unto thee full of eagerness
80:5767 and in awe [of God]
80:5768 him didst thou disregard!
80:5769 NAY, VERILY, these [messages] are but a reminder:
80:5770 and so, whoever is willing may remember Him
80:5771 in [the light of His] revelations blest with dignity,
80:5772 lofty and pure,
80:5773 [borne] by the hands of messengers
80:5774 noble and most virtuous.
80:5775 [But only too often] man destroys himself: how stubbornly does he deny the truth!
80:5776 [Does man ever consider] out of what substance [God] creates him?
80:5777 Out of a drop of sperm He creates him, and thereupon determines his nature,
80:5778 and then makes it easy for him to go through life;
80:5779 and in the end He causes him to die and brings him to the grave;
80:5780 and then, if it be His will, He shall raise him again to life,
80:5781 Nay, but [man] has never yet fulfilled what He has enjoined upon him!
80:5782 Let man, then, consider [the sources of] his food:
80:5783 [how it is] that We pour down water, pouring it down abundantly;
80:5784 and then We cleave the earth [with new growth], cleaving it asunder,
80:5785 and thereupon We cause grain to grow out of it,
80:5786 and vines and edible plants,
80:5787 and olive trees and date-palms,
80:5788 and gardens dense with foliage,
80:5789 and fruits and herbage,
80:5790 for you and for your animals to enjoy.
80:5791 AND SO, when the piercing call [of resurrection] is heard
80:5792 on a Day when everyone will [want to] flee from his brother,
80:5793 and from his mother and father,
80:5794 and from his spouse and his children:
80:5795 on that Day, to every one of them will his own state be of sufficient concern.
80:5796 Some faces will on that Day be bright with happiness,
80:5797 laughing, rejoicing at glad tidings.
80:5798 And some faces will on that Day with dust be covered,
80:5799 with darkness overspread:
80:5800 these, these will be the ones who denied the truth and were immersed in iniquity!
