99:6139 WHEN THE EARTH quakes with her [last] mighty quaking,
99:6140 and [when] the earth yields up her burdens,
99:6141 and man cries out, "What has happened to her?" -
99:6142 on that Day will she recount all her tidings,
99:6143 as thy Sustainer will have inspired her to do!
99:6144 On that Day will all men come forward, cut off from one another, to be shown their [past] deeds.
99:6145 And so, he who shall have done an atom's weight of good, shall behold it;
99:6146 and he who shall have done an atom's weight of evil, shall behold it.
