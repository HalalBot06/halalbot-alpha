102:6169 YOU ARE OBSESSED by greed for more and more
102:6170 until you go down to your graves.
102:6171 Nay, in time you will come to understand!
102:6172 And once again: Nay, in time you will come to understand!
102:6173 Nay, if you could but understand [it] with an understanding [born] of certainty,
102:6174 you would indeed, most surely, behold the blazing fire [of hell]!
102:6175 In the end you will indeed, most surely, behold it with the eye of certainty:
102:6176 and on that Day you will most surely be called to account for [what you did with] the boon of life!
