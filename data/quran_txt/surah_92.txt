92:6059 CONSIDER the night as it veils [the earth] in darkness,
92:6060 and the day as it rises bright!
92:6061 Consider the creation of the male and the female!
92:6062 Verily, [O men,] you aim at most divergent ends!
92:6063 Thus, as for him who gives [to others] and is conscious of God,
92:6064 and believes in the truth of the ultimate good
92:6065 for him shall We make easy the path towards [ultimate] ease.
92:6066 But as for him who is niggardly, and thinks that he is self-sufficient,
92:6067 and calls the ultimate good a lie –
92:6068 for him shall We make easy the path towards hardship:
92:6069 and what will his wealth avail him when he goes down [to his grave]?
92:6070 BEHOLD, it is indeed for Us to grace [you] with guidance;
92:6071 and, behold, Ours is [the dominion over] the life to come as well as [over] this earlier part [of your life]:
92:6072 and so I warn you of the raging fire -
92:6073 [the fire] which none shall have to endure but that most hapless wretch
92:6074 who gives the lie to the truth and turns away [from it].
92:6075 For, distant from it shall remain he who is truly conscious of God:
92:6076 he that spends his possessions [on others] so that he might grow in purity –
92:6077 not as payment for favours received,
92:6078 but only out of a longing for the countenance of his Sustainer, the All-Highest:
92:6079 and such, indeed, shall in time be well-pleased.
