83:5849 WOE UNTO THOSE who give short measure:
83:5850 those who, when they are to receive their due from [other] people, demand that it be given in full –
83:5851 but when they have to measure or weigh whatever they owe to others, give less than what is due!
83:5852 Do they not know that they are bound to be raised from the dead
83:5853 [and called to account] on an awesome Day –
83:5854 the Day when all men shall stand before the Sustainer of all the worlds?
83:5855 NAY, VERILY, the record of the wicked is indeed [set down] in a mode inescapable!
83:5856 And what could make thee conceive what that that mode inescapable will be?
83:5857 A record [indelibly] inscribed!
83:5858 Woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth –
83:5859 those who give the lie to the [coming of] Judgment Day:
83:5860 for, none gives the lie to it but such as are wont to transgress against all that is [and are] immersed in sin:
83:5861 [and so,] whenever Our messages are conveyed to them, they but say, "Fables of ancient times!"
83:5862 Nay, but their hearts are corroded by all [the evil] that they were wont to do!
83:5863 Nay, verily, from [the grace of] their Sustainer shall they on that Day be debarred;
83:5864 and then, behold, they shall enter the blazing fire
83:5865 and be told: "This is the [very thing] to which you were wont to give the lie!"
83:5866 NAY, VERILY - the record of the truly virtuous is [set down] in a mode most lofty!
83:5867 And what could make thee conceive what that mode most lofty will be?
83:5868 A record [indelibly] inscribed,
83:5869 witnessed~ by all who have [ever] been drawn close unto God.
83:5870 Behold, [in the life to come] the truly virtuous will indeed be in bliss:
83:5871 [resting on couches, they will look up [to God]:
83:5872 upon their faces thou wilt see the brightness of bliss.
83:5873 They will be given a drink of pure wine whereon the seal [of God] will have been set,
83:5874 pouring forth with a fragrance of musk. To that [wine of paradise], then, let all such aspire as [are willing to] aspire to things of high account:
83:5875 for it is composed of all that is most exalting
83:5876 a source [of bliss] whereof those who are drawn close unto God shall drink.
83:5877 BEHOLD, those who have abandoned themselves to sin are wont to laugh at such as have attained to faith
83:5878 and whenever they pass by them, they wink at one another [derisively];
83:5879 and whenever they return to people of their own kind, they return full of jests;
83:5880 and whenever they see those [who believe,] they say, "Behold, these [people] have indeed gone astray!"
83:5881 And, withal, they have no call to watch over [the beliefs of] others...
83:5882 But on the Day [of Judgment], they who had attained to faith will [be able to] laugh at the [erstwhile] deniers of the truth:
83:5883 [for, resting in paradise] on couches, they will look on [and say to themselves]:
83:5884 "Are these deniers of the truth being [thus] requited for [aught but] what they were wont to do?"
