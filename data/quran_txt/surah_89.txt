89:5994 CONSIDER the daybreak
89:5995 and the ten nights!
89:5996 Consider the multiple and the One!
89:5997 Consider the night as it runs its course!
89:5998 Considering all this - could there be, to anyone endowed with reason, a [more] solemn evidence of the truth?
89:5999 ART THOU NOT aware of how thy Sustainer has dealt with [the tribe of] ‘Ad,
89:6000 [the people of] Iram the many-pillared,
89:6001 the like of whom has never been reared in all the land? –
89:6002 and with [the tribe of] Thamud, who hollowed out rocks in the valley? –
89:6003 and with Pharaoh of the [many] tent-poles?
89:6004 [It was they] who transgressed all bounds of equity all over their lands,
89:6005 and brought about great corruption therein:
89:6006 and therefore thy Sustainer let loose upon them a scourge of suffering:
89:6007 for, verily, thy Sustainer is ever on the watch!
89:6008 BUT AS FOR man, whenever his Sustainer tries him by His generosity and by letting him enjoy a life of ease, he says, "My Sustainer has been [justly] generous towards me";
89:6009 whereas, whenever He tries him by straitening his means of livelihood, he says, "My Sustainer has disgraced me!"
89:6010 But nay, nay, [O men, consider all that you do and fail to do:] you are not generous towards the orphan,
89:6011 and you do not urge one another to feed the needy,
89:6012 and you devour the inheritance [of others] with devouring greed,
89:6013 and you love wealth with boundless love!
89:6014 Nay, but [how will you fare on Judgment Day,] when the earth is crushed with crushing upon crushing,
89:6015 and [the majesty of] thy Sustainer stands revealed, as well as [the true nature of] the angels; rank upon rank?
89:6016 And on that Day hell will be brought [within sight]; on that Day man will remember [all that he did and failed to do]: but what will that remembrance avail him?
89:6017 He will say, "Oh, would that I had. provided beforehand for my life [to come]!"
89:6018 For, none can make suffer as He will make suffer [the sinners] on that Day,
89:6019 and none can bind with bonds like His.
89:6020 [But unto the righteous God will say,] "O thou human being that hast attained to inner peace!
89:6021 Return thou unto thy Sustainer, well-pleased [and] pleasing [Him]:
89:6022 enter, then, together with My [other true] servants –
89:6023 yea, enter thou My paradise!"
