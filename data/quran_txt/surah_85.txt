85:5910 CONSIDER the sky full of great constellations,
85:5911 and [then bethink thyself of] the promised Day,
85:5912 and [of] Him who witnesses [all], and [of] that unto which witness is borne [by Him]!
85:5913 THEY DESTROY [but] themselves, they who would ready a pit
85:5914 of fire fiercely burning [for all who have attained to faith]!
85:5915 Lo! [With glee do] they contemplate that [fire],
85:5916 fully conscious of what they are doing to the believers,
85:5917 whom they hate for no other reason than that they believe in God, the Almighty, the One to whom all praise is due,
85:5918 [and] to whom the dominion of the heavens and the earth belongs. But God is witness unto everything!
85:5919 Verily, as for those who persecute believing men and believing women, and thereafter do not repent, hell's suffering awaits them: yea, suffering through fire awaits them!
85:5920 [But,] verily, they who attain to faith and do righteous deeds shall [in the life to come] have gardens through which running waters flow - that triumph most great!
85:5921 VERILY, thy Sustainer's grip is exceedingly strong!
85:5922 Behold, it is He who creates [man] in the first instance, and He [it is who] will bring him forth anew.
85:5923 And He alone is truly-forgiving, all-embracing in His love,
85:5924 in sublime almightiness enthroned,
85:5925 a sovereign doer of whatever He wills.
85:5926 HAS IT ever come within thy ken, the story of the [sinful] hosts
85:5927 of Pharaoh, and of [the tribe of] Thamud?
85:5928 And yet, they who are bent on denying the truth persist in giving it the lie:
85:5929 but all the while God encompasses them [with His knowledge and might] without their being aware of it.
85:5930 Nay, but this [divine writ which they reject] is a discourse sublime,
85:5931 upon an imperishable tablet [inscribed].
