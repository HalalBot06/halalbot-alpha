95:6099 CONSIDER the fig and the olive,
95:6100 and Mount Sinai,
95:6101 and this land secure!
95:6102 Verily, We create man in the best conformation;
95:6103 and thereafter We reduce him to the lowest of low
95:6104 excepting only such as attain to faith and do good works: and theirs shall be a reward unending!
95:6105 What, then, [O man,] could henceforth cause thee to give the lie to this moral law?
95:6106 Is not God the most just of judges?
