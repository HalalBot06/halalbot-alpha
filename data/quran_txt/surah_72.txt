72:5448 SAY: "It has been revealed to me that some of the unseen beings gave ear [to this divine writ], and thereupon said [unto their fellow-beings]: "'Verily, we have heard a wondrous discourse,
72:5449 guiding towards consciousness of what is right; and so We have come to believe in it. And we shall never ascribe divinity to anyone beside our Sustainer,
72:5450 for [we know] that sublimely exalted is our Sustainer's majesty: no consort has He ever taken unto Himself, nor a son!
72:5451 "'And [now we know] that the foolish among us were wont to say outrageous things about God,
72:5452 and that [we were mistaken when] we thought that neither man nor [any of] the invisible forces would ever tell a lie about God.
72:5453 Yet [it has always happened] that certain kinds of humans would seek refuge with certain kinds of [such] invisible forces: but these only increased their confusion –
72:5454 so much so that they came to think, as you [once] thought, that God would never [again] send forth anyone [as His apostle].
72:5455 "'And [so it happened] that we reached out towards heaven: but we found it filled with mighty guards and flames,
72:5456 notwithstanding that we were established in positions [which we had thought well-suited] to listening to [whatever secrets might be in] it: and anyone who now [or ever] tries to listen will [likewise] find a flame lying in wait for him!
72:5457 "'And [now we have become aware] that we [created beings] may not know whether evil fortune is intended for [any of] those who live on earth, or whether it is their Sustainer’s will to endow them with consciousness of what is right:
72:5458 Just as [we do not know how it happens] that some from among us are righteous, while some of us are [far] below that: we have always followed widely divergent paths.
72:5459 "'And, withal, we have come to know that we can never elude God [while we live] on earth, and that we can never elude Him by escaping [from life].
72:5460 Hence, as soon as we heard this [call to His] guidance, we came to believe in it: and he who believes in his Sustainer need never have fear of loss or injustice.
72:5461 "'Yet [it is true] that among us are such as have surrendered themselves to God - just as there are among us such as have abandoned themselves to wrongdoing. Now as for those who surrender themselves to Him - it is they that have attained to consciousness of what is right;
72:5462 but as for those who abandon themselves to wrongdoing - they are indeed but fuel for [the fires of] hell!’"
72:5463 [KNOW,] THEN, that if they [who have heard Our call] keep firmly to the [right] path, We shall certainly shower them with blessings abundant,
72:5464 so as to test them by this means: for he who shall turn away from the remembrance of his Sustainer, him will He cause to undergo suffering most grievous.
72:5465 And [know] that all worship is due to God [alone]: hence, do not invoke anyone side by side with God!
72:5466 Yet [thus it is] that whenever a servant of God stands up in prayer to Him, they [who are bent on denying the truth] would gladly overwhelm him with their crowds.
72:5467 Say: "I invoke my Sustainer alone, for I do not ascribe divinity to anyone beside Him."
72:5468 Say: "Verily, it is not in my power to cause you harm or to endow you with consciousness of what is right."
72:5469 Say: "Verily, no one could ever protect me from God, nor could I ever find a place to hide from Him
72:5470 if I should fail to convey [to the world whatever illumination comes to me] from God and His messages." Now as for him who rebels against God and His Apostle - verily, the fire of hell awaits him, therein to abide beyond the count of time.
72:5471 [Let them, then, wait] until the time when they behold that [doom] of which they were forewarned: for then they will come to understand which [kind of man] is more helpless and counts for less!
72:5472 Say: "I do not know whether that [doom] of which you were forewarned is near, or whether my Sustainer has set for it a distant term."
72:5473 He [alone] knows that which is beyond the reach of a created being's perception, and to none does He disclose aught of the mysteries of His Own unfathomable knowledge,
72:5474 unless it be to an apostle whom He has been pleased to elect [there for]: and then He sends forth [the forces of heaven] to watch over him in whatever lies open before him and in what is beyond his ken –
72:5475 so as to make manifest that it is indeed [but] their Sustainer's messages that these [apostles] deliver: for it is He who encompasses [with His knowledge] all that they have [to say], just as He takes count, one by one, of everything [that exists].
