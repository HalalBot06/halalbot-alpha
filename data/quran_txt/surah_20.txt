20:2349 O MAN!
20:2350 We did not bestow the Qur'an on thee from on high to make thee unhappy,
20:2351 but only as an exhortation to all who stand in awe [of God]:
20:2352 a revelation from Him who has created the earth and the high heavens
20:2353 the Most Gracious, established on the throne of His almightiness?
20:2354 Unto Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, as well as all that is between them and all that is beneath the sod.
20:2355 And if thou say anything aloud, [He hears it] since, behold, He knows [even] the secret [thoughts of man] as well as all that is yet more hidden [within him].
20:2356 God-there is no deity save Him; His [alone] are the attributes of perfection!
20:2357 AND HAS the story of Moses ever come within thy ken?
20:2358 Lo! he saw a fire [in the desert]; and so he said to his family: "Wait here! Behold, I perceive a fire [far away]: perhaps I can bring you a brand there from, or find at the fire some guidance."
20:2359 But when he came close to it, a voice called out: "O Moses!
20:2360 Verily, I am thy Sustainer! Take off, then, thy sandals! Behold, thou art in the twice hallowed valley,
20:2361 and I have chosen thee [to be My apostle]: listen, then, to what is being revealed [unto thee].
20:2362 "Verily, I - I alone - am God; there is no deity save Me. Hence, worship Me alone, and be constant in prayer, so as to remember Me!
20:2363 "Behold, [although] I have willed to keep it hidden, the Last Hour is bound to come, so that every human being may be recompensed in accordance with what he strove for [in life].
20:2364 Hence, let not anyone who does not believe in its coming and follows [but] his own desires divert thee from [belief in] it, lest thou perish!
20:2365 "Now, what is this in thy right hand, O Moses?"
20:2366 He answered: "It is my staff; I lean on it; and with it I beat down leaves for my sheep; and [many] other uses have I for it."
20:2367 Said He: "Throw it down, O Moses!"
20:2368 So he threw it - and lo! it was a snake, moving rapidly.
20:2369 Said He: "Take hold of it, and fear not: We shall restore it to its former state.
20:2370 "Now place thy hand within thy armpit: it will come forth [shining] white, without blemish, as another sign [of Our grace],
20:2371 so that We might make thee aware of some of Our greatest wonders.
20:2372 "[And now] go thou unto Pharaoh: for, verily, he has transgressed all bounds of equity.
20:2373 Said [Moses]: "O my Sustainer! Open up my heart [to Thy light],
20:2374 and make my task easy for me,
20:2375 and loosen the knot from my tongue
20:2376 so that they might fully understand my speech,
20:2377 and appoint for me, out of my kinsfolk, one who will help me to bear my burden:
20:2378 Aaron, my brother.
20:2379 Add Thou through him to my strength,
20:2380 and let him share my task,
20:2381 so that [together] we might abundantly extol Thy limitless glory
20:2382 and remember Thee without cease!
20:2383 Verily, Thou seest all that is within us!"
20:2384 Said He: "Thou art granted all that thou hast asked for, O Moses!
20:2385 "And, indeed, We bestowed Our favour upon thee at a time long since past,
20:2386 when We inspired thy mother with this inspiration:
20:2387 Place him in a chest and throw it into the river, and thereupon the river will cast him ashore, [and] one who is an enemy unto Me and an enemy unto him will adopt him. "And [thus early] I spread Mine Own love over thee -and [this] in order that thou might be formed under Mine eye.
20:2388 "[And thou wert under Mine eye] when thy sister went forth and said [to Pharaoh's people], 'Shall I guide you unto [a woman] who might take charge of him?'' And so We returned thee unto thy mother, so that her eye be gladdened, and that she might not sorrow [any longer]. "And [when thou camest of age, thou didst slay a man: but We did save thee from all grief, although We tried thee with various trials. "And then thou didst sojourn for years among the people of Madyan; and now thou hast come [here] as ordained [by Me], O Moses:
20:2389 for I have chosen thee for Mine Own service.
20:2390 "Go forth, [then,] thou and thy brother, with My messages, and never tire of remembering Me:
20:2391 go forth, both of you, unto Pharaoh: for, verily, he has transgressed all bounds of equity!
20:2392 But speak unto him in a mild manner, so that he might bethink himself or [at least] be filled with apprehension.
20:2393 The two [brothers] said: "O our Sustainer! Verily, we fear lest he act hastily with regard to us, or lest he [continue to] transgress all bounds of equity."
20:2394 Answered He: "Fear not! Verily, I shall be with you two, hearing and seeing [all].
20:2395 Go, then; you two unto him and say, `Behold, we are apostles sent by thy Sustainer: let, then, the children of Israel go with us, and cause them not to suffer [any longer]. We have now come unto thee with a message from thy Sustainer; and [know that His] peace shall be [only] on those who follow [His] guidance:
20:2396 for, behold, it has been revealed to us that [in the life to come] suffering shall befall all who give the lie to the truth and turn away [from it]!"'
20:2397 [But when God's message was conveyed unto Pharaoh,] he said: "Who, now, is this Sustainer of you two, O Moses?"
20:2398 He replied: "Our Sustainer is He who gives unto every thing [that exists] its true nature and form. and thereupon guides it [towards its fulfilment].
20:2399 Said [Pharaoh]: "And what of all the past generations?"
20:2400 [Moses] answered: "Knowledge thereof rests with my Sustainer [alone, and is laid down] in His decree; my Sustainer does not err, and neither does He forget."
20:2401 HE IT IS who has made the earth a cradle for you, and has traced out for you ways [of livelihood] thereon, and [who] sends down waters from the sky: and by this means We bring forth various kinds of plants.
20:2402 Eat, [then, of this produce of the soil,] and pasture your cattle [thereon]. In all this, behold, there are messages indeed for those who are endowed with reason:
20:2403 out of this [earth] have We created you, and into it shall We return you, and out of it shall We bring you forth once again.
20:2404 AND, INDEED, We made Pharaoh aware of all Our messages-but he gave them the lie and refused [to heed them].
20:2405 He said: "Hash thou come to drive us out of our land by thy sorcery, O Moses?
20:2406 In that case, we shall most certainly produce before thee the like thereof! Appoint, then, a tryst between us and thee - which we shall not fail to keep, nor [mayest] thou -at a suitable place!"
20:2407 Answered [Moses]: "Your tryst shall be the day of the Festival; and let the people assemble when the sun is risen high."
20:2408 Thereupon Pharaoh withdrew [with his counsellors] and decided upon the scheme which he would pursue; and then he came [to the tryst].
20:2409 Said Moses to them: "Woe unto you! Do not invent lies against God, lest He afflict you with most grievous suffering: for He who contrives [such] a lie is already undone!"
20:2410 So they debated among themselves as to what to do; but they kept their counsel secret,
20:2411 saying [to one another]: "These two are surely sorcerers intent on driving you from your land by their sorcery, and on doing away with your time-honoured way of life.
20:2412 Hence, [O sorcerers of Egypt,] decide upon the scheme which you will pursue, and then come forward in one single body: for, indeed, he who prevails today shall prosper indeed!"
20:2413 Said [the sorcerers]: "O Moses! Either thou throw (thy staff first], or we shall be the first to throw."
20:2414 He answered: "Nay, you throw [first]." And lo! by virtue of their sorcery, their [magic] ropes and staffs seemed to him to be moving rapidly:
20:2415 and in his heart Moses became apprehensive.
20:2416 [But] We said: "Fear not! Verily, it is thou who shalt prevail!
20:2417 And [now] throw that [staff] which is in thy right hand -it shall swallow up all that they have wrought: [for] they have wrought only a sorcerer's artifice, and the sorcerer can never come to any good, whatever he may aim at!"
20:2418 [And so it happened and down fell the sorcerers, prostrating themselves in adoration, [and] exclaimed: "We have come to believe in the Sustainer of Moses and Aaron!"
20:2419 Said [Pharaoh]: "Have you come to believe in him ere I have given you permission? Verily, he must be your master who has taught you magic! But I shall most certainly cut off your hands and feet in great numbers, because of [your] perverseness, and I shall most certainly crucify you in great numbers on trunks of palm-trees: and [I shall do this] so that you might come to know for certain as to which of us [two] can inflict a more severe chastisement, and [which] is the more abiding!"
20:2420 They answered: "Never shall we prefer thee to all the evidence of the truth that has come unto us, nor to Him who has brought us into being! Decree, then, whatever thou art going to decree: thou canst decree only [something that pertains to] this worldly life!
20:2421 As for us, behold, we have come to believe in our Sustainer, [hoping] that He may forgive us our faults and all that magic unto which thou hast forced us: for God is the best [to look forward to], and the One who is truly abiding."
20:2422 VERILY, as for him who shall appear before his Sustainer [on Judgment Day] lost in sin - his [portion], behold, shall be hell: he will neither die therein nor live;
20:2423 whereas he who shall appear before Him as a believer who has done righteous deeds - it is such that shall have lofty stations [in the life to come]:
20:2424 gardens of perpetual bliss, through which running waters flow, therein to abide: for that shall be the recompense of all who attain to purity.
20:2425 AND, INDEED, [a time came when] We thus inspired Moses: "Go forth with My servants by night, and strike out for them a dry path through the sea; [and] fear not of being overtaken, and dread not [the sea]."
20:2426 And Pharaoh pursued them with his hosts: and they were overwhelmed by the sea which was destined to overwhelm them.
20:2427 because Pharaoh had led his people astray and had not guided [them] aright.
20:2428 O children of Israel! [Thus] We saved you from your enemy, and [then] We made a covenant with you on the right-hand slope of Mount Sinai, and repeatedly sent down manna and quails unto you, [saying,]
20:2429 "Partake of the good things which We have provided for you as sustenance, but do not transgress therein the bounds of equity lest My condemnation fall upon you: for, he upon whom My condemnation falls has indeed thrown himself into utter ruin!"
20:2430 Yet withal, behold, I forgive all sins unto any who repents and attains to faith and does righteous deeds, and thereafter keeps to the right path.
20:2431 [AND GOD SAID:] "Now what has caused thee, O Moses, to leave thy people behind in so great a haste?"
20:2432 He answered: "They are treading in my footsteps while I have hastened unto Thee, O my Sustainer, so that Thou might be well-pleased [with me]."
20:2433 Said He: "Then [know that], verily, in thy absence We have put thy people to a test, and the Samaritan has led them astray."
20:2434 Thereupon Moses returned to his people full of wrath and sorrow, [and] exclaimed: "O my people! Did not your Sustainer hold out [many] a goodly promise to you? bid, then, [the fulfilment of] this promise seem to you too long in coming? Or are you, perchance, determined to see your Sustainer's condemnation fall upon you, and so you broke your promise to me?"
20:2435 They answered: "We did not break our promise to thee of our own free will, but [this is what happened:] we were loaded with the [sinful] burdens of the [Egyptian] people's ornaments, and so we threw them [into the fire], and likewise did this Samaritan cast [his into it]."
20:2436 But then, [so they told Moses, the Samaritan] had produced for them [out of the molten gold] the effigy of a calf, which made a lowing sound; and thereupon they said [to one another], "This is your deity, and the deity of Moses-but he has forgotten [his past]
20:2437 Why-did they not see that [the thing] could not give them any response, and had no power to harm or to benefit them?
20:2438 And, indeed, even before [the return of Moses] had Aaron said unto them: "O my people! You are but being tempted to evil by this [idol] -for, behold, your [only] Sustainer is the Most Gracious! Follow me, then, and obey my bidding!"
20:2439 [But] they answered: "By no means shall we cease to worship it until Moses comes back to us!"
20:2440 [And now that he had come back, Moses] said: "O Aaron! What has prevented thee, when thou didst see that they had gone astray,
20:2441 from [abandoning them and] following me? Hast thou, then, [deliberately] disobeyed my commandment?"
20:2442 Answered [Aaron]: "O my mother's son! Seize me not by my beard, nor by my head! Behold, I was afraid lest [on thy return] thou say, 'Thou hast caused a split among the children of Israel, and hast paid no heed to my bidding!"
20:2443 Said [Moses]: "What, then, didst thou have in view, O Samaritan?"
20:2444 He answered: "I have gained insight into something which they were unable to see: and so I took hold of a handful of the Apostle's teachings and cast it away: for thus has my mind prompted me [to act]."
20:2445 Said [Moses]; "Begone, then! And, behold, it shall be thy lot to say throughout [thy] life, `Touch me not! But, verily, [in the life to come] thou shalt be faced with a destiny from which there will be no escape! And [now] look at this deity of thine to whose worship thou hast become so devoted: we shall most certainly burn it, and then scatter [whatever remains of] it far and wide over the sea!
20:2446 Your only deity is God - He save whom there is no deity, [and whho] embraces all things within His knowledge!"
20:2447 THUS DO WE relate unto thee some of the stories of what happened in the past; and [thus] have We vouchsafed unto thee, out of Our grace, a reminder.
20:2448 All who shall turn away from it will, verily, bear a [heavy] burden on the Day of Resurrection:
20:2449 they will abide in this [state], and grievous for them will be the weight [of that burden] on the Day of Resurrection -
20:2450 on the Day when the trumpet is blown: for on that Day We will assemble all such as had been lost in sin, their eyes dimmed [by terror],
20:2451 whispering unto one another, "You have spent but ten [days on earth]
20:2452 [But] We know best what they will be saying when the most perceptive of them shall say, "You have spent [there] but one day!"
20:2453 AND THEY WILL ask thee about [what will happen to] the mountains [when this world comes to an end]. Say, then: "My Sustainer will scatter them far and wide,
20:2454 and leave the earths level and bare,
20:2455 [so that] thou wilt see no curve thereon, and no ruggedness.
20:2456 On that Day, all will. follow the summoning Voice from which there will be no escape; and all sounds will be hushed before the Most Gracious, and thou wilt hear nothing but a faint sough in the air.
20:2457 On that Day, intercession shall be of no avail [to any] save him in whose case the Most Gracious will have granted leave therefor, and whose word [of faith) He will have accepted:
20:2458 [for] He knows all that lies open before men and all that is hidden from them, whereas they cannot encompass Him with their knowledge.
20:2459 And [on that Day] all faces will be humbled before the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsistent Fount of All Being; and undone shall be he who bears [a burden of] evildoing
20:2460 whereas anyone who will have done [whatever he could] of righteous deeds, and was a believer withal, need have no fear of being wronged or deprived [of aught of his merit].
20:2461 AND THUS have We bestowed from on high this [divine writ] as a discourse in the Arabic tongue, and have given therein many facets to all manner of warnings, so that men might remain conscious of Us, or that it give rise to a new awareness in them
20:2462 [Know,] then, [that) God is sublimely exalted. the Ultimate Sovereign, the Ultimate Truth and [knowing this,] do not approach the Qur'an in haste, ere it has been revealed unto thee in full, but [always) say: "O my Sustainer, cause me to grow in knowledge!
20:2463 AND, INDEED, long ago did We impose Our commandment on Adam; but he forgot it, and We found no firmness of purpose in him.
20:2464 For [thus it was:] when We told the angels, "Prostrate yourselves before Adam!"- they all prostrated themselves, save Ibis, who refused [to do it];
20:2465 and thereupon We said: "O Adam! Verily, this is a foe unto thee and thy wife: so let him not drive the two of you out of this garden and render thee unhappy.
20:2466 Behold, it is provided for thee that thou shalt not hunger here or feel naked,
20:2467 and that thou shalt not thirst here or suffer from the heat of the sun."
20:2468 But Satan whispered unto him, saying: "O Adam! Shall I lead thee to the tree of life eternal; and [thus] to a kingdom that will never decay?"
20:2469 And so the two ate [of the fruit] thereof: and thereupon they became conscious of their nakedness and began to cover themselves with pieced-together leaves from the garden. And [thus] did Adam disobey his Sustainer, and thus did he fall into grievous error.
20:2470 Thereafter, [however,) his Sustainer elected him [for His grace], and accepted his repentance, and bestowed His guidance upon him,
20:2471 saying: "Down with you all from this [state of innocence, and be henceforth] enemies unto one another! None the less, there shall most certainly come unto you guidance from Me: and he who follows My guidance will not go astray, and neither will he be unhappy.
20:2472 But as for him who shall turn away from remembering Me - his shall be a life of narrow scope and on the Day of Resurrection We shall raise him up blind."
20:2473 [And so, on Resurrection Day, the sinner] will ask: "O my Sustainer! Why hast Thou raised me up blind, whereas [on earth] I was endowed with sight?"
20:2474 [God] will reply: "Thus it is: there came unto thee Our messages, but thou wert oblivious of them; and thus shalt thou be today consigned to oblivion!"
20:2475 For, thus shall We recompense him who wastes his own self and does not believe in his Sustainer's messages: and, indeed, the suffering [of such sinners] in the life to come shall be most severe and most enduring!
20:2476 CAN, THEN, they [who reject the truth] learn no lesson by recalling how many a generation We have destroyed before their time? - [people] in whose dwelling-places they [themselves now] walk about? In this, behold, there are messages indeed for those who are endowed with reason!
20:2477 Now were it not for a decree that has already gone forth from thy Sustainer, setting a term [for each sinner's repentance], it would inescapably follow [that all who sin must be doomed at once].
20:2478 Hence, bear with patience whatever they [who deny the truth] may say, and extol thy Sustainer's limitless glory and praise Him before the rising of the sun and before its setting; and extol His glory, too, during some of the hours of the night as well as during the hours of the day, so that thou might attain to happiness.
20:2479 And never turn thine, eyes [with longing] towards whatever splendour of this world's life We may have allowed so many others to enjoy in order that We might test them thereby: for the sustenance which thy Sustainer provides [for thee] is better and more enduring.
20:2480 And bid thy people to pray, and persevere therein. [But remember:] We do not ask thee to provide sustenance [for Us]: it is We who provide sustenance for thee. And the future belongs to the God-conscious.
20:2481 NOW THEY [who are blind to the truth] are wont to say, "If [Muhammad] would but produce for us a miracle from his Sustainer! [But] has there not come unto them a clear evidence [of the truth of this divine writ] in what is [to be found] in the earlier scriptures?
20:2482 For [thus it is:] had We destroyed them by means of a chastisement ere this [divine writ was revealed], they would indeed [be justified to] say [on Judgment Day]: "O our Sustainer! If only Thou hadst sent an apostle unto us, we would have followed Thy messages rather than be humiliated and disgraced [in the hereafter]!"
20:2483 Say: "Everyone is hopefully waiting [for what the future may bring]: wait, then, [for the Day of Judgment] for then you will come to know as to who has followed the even path, and who has found guidance!"
