88:5968 HAS THERE COME unto thee the tiding of the Overshadowing Event?'
88:5969 Some faces will on that Day be downcast,
88:5970 toiling [under burdens of sin], worn out [by fear],
88:5971 about to enter a glowing fire,
88:5972 given to drink from a boiling spring.
88:5973 No food for them save the bitterness of dry thorns,
88:5974 which gives no strength and neither stills hunger.
88:5975 [And] some faces will on that Day shine with bliss,
88:5976 well-pleased with [the fruit of] their striving,
88:5977 in a garden sublime,
88:5978 wherein thou wilt hear no empty talk.
88:5979 Countless springs will flow therein,
88:5980 [and] there will be thrones [of happiness] raised high,
88:5981 and goblets placed ready,
88:5982 and cushions ranged,
88:5983 and carpets spread outâ€¦
88:5984 DO, THEN, they [who deny resurrection] never gaze at the clouds pregnant with water, [and observe] how they are created?
88:5985 And at the sky, how it is raised aloft?
88:5986 And at the mountains, how firmly they are reared?
88:5987 And at the earth, how it is spread out?
88:5988 And so, [O Prophet,] exhort them; thy task is only to exhort:
88:5989 thou canst not compel them [to believe].
88:5990 However, as for him who turns away, being bent on denying the truth,
88:5991 him will God cause to suffer the greatest suffering [in the life to come]:
88:5992 for behold, unto Us will be their return,
88:5993 and verily, It is for Us to call them to account.
