15:1803 Alif. Lam. Ra. THESE ARE MESSAGES of revelation -of a discourse clear in itself and clearly showing the truth.
15:1804 And it will come to pass that those who are [now] bent on denying this truth will wish that they had surrendered themselves to God [in their life time].
15:1805 Leave them alone; let them eat and enjoy themselves the while the hope [of vain delights] be guiles them: for in time they will come to know [the truth].
15:1806 And never have We destroyed any community [for its wrongdoing] unless a divine writ had (previously] been made known to it;
15:1807 [but remember that] no community can ever forestall [the end of] its term - and neither can they delay [it].
15:1808 And yet, they [who deny the truth] say: "O thou unto whom this reminder has [allegedly] been bestowed from on high: verily, thou art mad!
15:1809 Why dost thou not bring before us angels, if thou art a man of truth?
15:1810 [Yet] We never send down angels otherwise than in accordance with the [demands of] truth; and [were the angels to appear now,] lo! they [who reject this divine writ] would have no further respite!
15:1811 Behold, it is We Ourselves who have bestowed from on high, step by step, this reminder? and, behold, it is We who shall truly guard it [from all corruption].
15:1812 AND, INDEED, [O Prophet,] even before thy time did We send [Our apostles] unto communities of old -
15:1813 and never yet came an apostle to them without their deriding him.
15:1814 Even so do We [now] cause this [scorn of Our message] to pervade the hearts of those who are lost in sin,
15:1815 who do not believe in it, although the way which those [evildoers] of olden times had to go has long been within their ken.
15:1816 Yet even had We opened to them a gateway to heaven and they had ascended, on and on, up to it,
15:1817 they would surely have said, "It is only our eyes that are spellbound! Nay, we have been bewitched!,
15:1818 AND, INDEED, We have set up in the heavens great constellations, and endowed them with beauty for all to behold;
15:1819 and We have made them secure against every satanic force accursed -
15:1820 so that anyone who seeks to learn [the unknowable] by stealth is pursued by a flame clear to see.
15:1821 And the earth -We have spread it out wide, and placed on it mountains firm, and caused [life] of every kind to grow on it in a balanced manner,
15:1822 and provided thereon means of livelihood for you [O men] as well as for all [living beings] whose sustenance does not depend on you.
15:1823 For, no single thing exists that does not have its source with Us; and nought do We bestow from on high unless it be in accordance with a measure well-defined.
15:1824 And We let loose the winds to fertilize [plants] and We send down water from the skies and let you drink thereof: and it is not you who dispose of its source-
15:1825 for, behold, it is We-We alone -who grant life and deal death, and it is We alone who shall remain after all else will have passed away!
15:1826 And well do We know [the hearts and deeds of all human beings - both] those who lived before you and those who will come after you;
15:1827 and, behold, it is thy Sustainer who will gather them all together [on Judgment Day]: verily, He is wise, all-knowing!
15:1828 AND, INDEED, We have created man out of sounding clay, out of dark-slime transmuted
15:1829 whereas the invisible beings We had created, [long] before that, out of the fire of scorching winds.
15:1830 And lo! Thy Sustainer said unto the angels: "Behold, I am about to create mortal man out of sounding clay, out of dark slime transmuted;
15:1831 and when I have formed him fully and breathed into him of My spirit, fall down before him in prostration!
15:1832 Thereupon the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together,
15:1833 save Iblis: he refused to be among those who prostrated themselves.
15:1834 Said He: "O Iblis! What is thy reason for not being among those who have prostrated themselves?"
15:1835 [Iblis] replied: "It is not for me to prostrate myself before mortal man whom Thou hast created out of sounding clay, out of dark slime transmuted!"
15:1836 Said He: "Go forth, then, from this [angelic state]: for, behold, thou art [henceforth] accursed,
15:1837 and [My] rejection shall be thy due until the Day of Judgment!"
15:1838 Said [Iblis]: "Then, O my Sustainer, grant me a respite till the Day when all shall be raised from the dead!"
15:1839 Answered He: "Verily, so be it: thou shalt be among those who are granted respite
15:1840 till the Day the time whereof is known [to Me alone]."
15:1841 [Whereupon Iblis] said: "O my Sustainer! Since Thou hast thwarted me, I shall indeed make [all that is evil] on earth seem goodly to them, and shall most certainly beguile them-into grievous error -
15:1842 [all] save such of them as are truly Thy servants!"
15:1843 Said He: "This is, with Me. a straight way:
15:1844 verily, thou shalt have no power over My creatures- unless it be such as are [already] lost in grievous error and follow thee [of their own will]:
15:1845 and for all such, behold, hell is the promised goal.
15:1846 with seven gates leading into it, each gate receiving its allotted share of sinners. -
15:1847 VERILY, those who are conscious of God [shall find themselves in the hereafter] amidst gardens and springs,
15:1848 [having been received with the greeting,] "Enter here in peace, secure!"
15:1849 And [by then] We shall have removed whatever unworthy thoughts or feelings may have been [lingering] in their breasts, [and they shall rest] as brethren, facing one another [in love] upon thrones of happiness.
15:1850 No weariness shall ever touch them in this [state of bliss], and never shall they have to forgo it.
15:1851 Tell My servants that I - I alone - am truly forgiving, a true dispenser of grace;
15:1852 and [also,] that the suffering which I shall impose [on sinners] will indeed be a suffering most grievous.
15:1853 AND TELL THEM [once again] about Abraham's guests -
15:1854 [how,] when they presented themselves before him and bade him peace, he answered: "Behold, we are afraid of you!"
15:1855 Said they: "Fear not! Behold, we bring thee the glad tiding of [the birth of] a son who will be endowed with deep knowledge."
15:1856 Said he: "Do you give me this glad tiding despite the fact that old age has overtaken me? Of what [strange thing], then, are you giving me a tiding!"
15:1857 They answered: "We have given thee the glad tiding of something that is bound to come true. - so be not of those who abandon hope!"
15:1858 [Abraham] exclaimed: "And who-other than those who have utterly lost their way-could ever abandon the hope of his Sustainer's grace?"
15:1859 He added: "And what [else] may you have in view, O you [heavenly] messengers?"
15:1860 They answered: "We are sent to people lost in sin [who are to be destroyed],
15:1861 barring Lot's household, all of whom, behold, we shall save -
15:1862 excepting only his wife, [of whom God says,] `We have ordained [that], behold, she should be among those who stay behind!'
15:1863 AND WHEN the messengers [of God] came to the house of Lot,
15:1864 he said: "Behold, you are people unknown [here]!"
15:1865 They answered: "Nay, but we have come unto thee with [the announcement of] something that they [who are given to evil] have always been wont to call in question,
15:1866 and we are bringing thee the certainty [of its fulfilment]: for, behold, we are speaking the truth indeed.
15:1867 Go, then., with thy household while it is yet night, with thyself following them in the rear; and let none of you look back, but proceed whither you are bidden."
15:1868 And [through Our messengers] We revealed unto him this decree: "The last remnant of those [sinners] shall be wiped out" in the morn."
15:1869 And the people of the city came [unto Lot], rejoicing at the glad tiding.
15:1870 Exclaimed [Lot]: "Behold, these are my guests: so put me not to shame,
15:1871 but be conscious of God and disgrace me not!"
15:1872 They answered: "Have we not forbidden thee [to offer protection] to any kind of people?"
15:1873 [Lot] said: "[Take instead] these daughters of mine, if you must do [whatever you intend to do]!"
15:1874 [But the angels spoke thus:] "As thou livest, [O Lot, they will not listen to thee:] behold, in their delirium [of lust] they are but blindly stumbling to and fro!"
15:1875 And thereupon the blast [of Our punishment] overtook them at the time of sunrise,
15:1876 and We turned those [sinful towns} upside down, and rained down upon them stone-hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained.
15:1877 Verily, in all this there are messages indeed for those who can read the signs:
15:1878 for, behold, those [towns] stood by a road that still exists.
15:1879 Verily, herein lies a message indeed for all who believe [in God].
15:1880 AND THE DWELLERS of the wooded dales [of Madyan, too,] were inveterate evildoers,
15:1881 and so We inflicted Our retribution on them. And, behold, both these [sinful communities] lived by a highway, [to this day] plain to see
15:1882 AND, [likewise,] indeed, the people of Al-Hijr gave the lie to [Our] message-bearers:
15:1883 for We did vouchsafe them Our messages, but they obstinately turned their backs upon them-
15:1884 notwithstanding that they had been wont [to enjoy Our blessings and] to hew out dwellings from the mountains, [wherein they could live] in security
15:1885 and so the blast [of Our punishment] overtook them at early morn,
15:1886 and of no avail to them was all [the power] that they had acquired.
15:1887 AND [remember:] We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them without [an inner] truth; but, behold, the Hour [when this will become clear to all] is indeed yet to come. Hence, forgive [men's failings] with fair forbearance:
15:1888 verily, thy Sustainer is the all-knowing Creator of all things!
15:1889 AND, INDEED, We have bestowed upon thee seven of the oft repeated [verses], and [have, thus, laid open before thee] this sublime Qur'an:
15:1890 [so] turn, not thine eyes [longingly] towards the worldly benefits which We have granted unto some of those [that deny the truth]. And neither grieve over those [who refuse to heed thee], but spread the wings of thy tenderness over the believers,
15:1891 and say: "Behold, I am indeed the plain warner [promised by God]!
15:1892 [For, thou art the bearer of a divine writ] such as We have bestowed from on high upon those who [afterwards] broke it up into parts,
15:1893 [and] who [now] declare this Qur'an to be [a tissue of] falsehoods!
15:1894 But, by thy Sustainer! [On the Day of Judgment] We shall indeed call them to account, one and all,
15:1895 for whatever they have done!
15:1896 Hence, proclaim openly all that thou hast been bidden [to say], and leave alone all those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God:
15:1897 verily, We shall suffice thee against all who [now] deride [this message - all]
15:1898 who assert that there are, side by side with God, other divine powers as well: for in time they will come to know [the truth].
15:1899 And well do We know that thy bosom is constricted by the [blasphemous] things that they say:
15:1900 but extol thou thy Sustainer's limitless glory and praise Him, and be of those who prostrate themselves [before Him] in adoration,
15:1901 and worship thy Sustainer till death comes to thee.
