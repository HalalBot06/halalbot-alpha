86:5932 CONSIDER the heavens and that which comes in the night!
86:5933 And what could make thee conceive what it is that comes in the night?
86:5934 It is the star that pierces through [life's] darkness:
86:5935 [for] no human being has ever been left unguarded.
86:5936 LET MAN, then, observe out of what he has been created:
86:5937 he has been created out of a seminal fluid
86:5938 issuing from between the loins [of man] and the pelvic arch [of woman].
86:5939 Now, verily, He [who thus creates man in the first instance] is well able to bring him back [to life]
86:5940 on the Day when all secrets will be laid bare,
86:5941 and [man] will have neither strength nor helper!
86:5942 Consider the heavens, ever-revolving,
86:5943 and the earth, bursting forth with plants!
86:5944 BEHOLD, this [divine writ] is indeed a word that between truth and falsehood,
86:5945 and is no idle tale.
86:5946 Behold, they [who refuse to accept it] devise many a false argument [to disprove its truth];
86:5947 but I shall bring all their scheming to nought.
86:5948 Let, then, the deniers of the truth have their will: let them have their will for a little while.
