79:5713 CONSIDER those [stars] that rise only to set,
79:5714 and move [in their orbits] with steady motion,
79:5715 and float [through space] with floating serene,
79:5716 and yet overtake [one another] with swift overtaking:
79:5717 and thus they fulfil the [Creator's] behest!
79:5718 [HENCE, think of] the Day when a violent convulsion will convulse [the world],
79:5719 to be followed by further [convulsions]!
79:5720 On that Day will [men's] hearts be throbbing,
79:5721 [and] their eyes downcast...
79:5722 [And yet,] some say, "What! Are we indeed to be restored to our former state –
79:5723 even though we may have become [a heap of] crumbling bones?"
79:5724 [And] they add, "That, then, would be a return with loss!"
79:5725 [But,] then, that [Last Hour] will be [upon them of a sudden, as if it were] but a single accusing cry -
79:5726 and then, lo, they will be fully awakened [to the truth]!
79:5727 HAS THE STORY of Moses ever come within thy ken.
79:5728 Lo! His Sustainer called out to him in the twice-hallowed valley:
79:5729 "Go unto Pharaoh - for, verily, he has transgressed all bounds of what is right -
79:5730 and say [unto him], 'Art thou desirous of attaining to purity?
79:5731 [If so,] then I shall guide thee towards [a cognition of] thy Sustainer, so that [henceforth] thou wilt stand in awe [of Him].’"
79:5732 And thereupon he [went to Pharaoh and] made him aware of the great wonder [of God's grace].
79:5733 But [Pharaoh] gave him the lie and rebelliously rejected [all guidance],
79:5734 and brusquely turned his back [on Moses];
79:5735 and then he gathered [his great ones], and called [unto his people],
79:5736 and said, "I am your Lord All-Highest!"
79:5737 And thereupon God took him to task, [and made him] a warning example in the life to come as well as in this world.
79:5738 In this, behold, there is a lesson indeed for all who stand in awe [of God].
79:5739 [O MEN!] Are you more difficult to create than the heaven which He has built?
79:5740 High has He reared its vault and formed it in accordance with what it was meant to be;
79:5741 and He has made dark its night and brought forth its light of day.
79:5742 And after that, the earth: wide has He spread its expanse,
79:5743 and has caused its waters to come out of it, and its pastures,
79:5744 and has made the mountains firm:
79:5745 [all this] as a means of livelihood for you and your animals.
79:5746 AND SO, when the great overwhelming event [of, resurrection] comes to pass –
79:5747 on that Day man will [clearly] remember all that he has ever wrought;
79:5748 and the blazing fire [of hell] will be lad open before all who [are destined to] see it.
79:5749 For, unto him who shall have transgressed the bounds of what is right,
79:5750 and preferred the life of this world [to the good of his soul],
79:5751 that blazing fire will truly be the goal!
79:5752 But unto him who shall have stood in fear of his Sustainer's Presence, and held back his inner self from base desires,
79:5753 paradise will truly be the goal!
79:5754 THEY WILL ASK thee [O Prophet] about the Last Hour: "When will it come to pass?"
79:5755 [But] how couldst thou tell anything about it,
79:5756 [seeing that] with thy Sustainer alone rests the beginning and the end [of all knowledge] thereof?
79:5757 Thou art but [sent] to warn those who stand in awe of it.
79:5758 On the Day when they behold it, [it will seem to them] as if they had tarried [in this world] no longer than one evening or [one night, ending with] its morn!
