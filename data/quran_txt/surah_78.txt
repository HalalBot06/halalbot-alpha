78:5673 ABOUT WHAT do they [most often] ask one another?
78:5674 About the awesome tiding [of resurrection],
78:5675 on which they [so utterly] disagree.
78:5676 Nay, but in time they will come to understand [it]!
78:5677 And once again: Nay, but in time they will come to understand!
78:5678 HAVE WE NOT made the earth a resting-place [for you],
78:5679 and the mountains [its] pegs?
78:5680 And We have created you in pairs;
78:5681 and We have made your sleep [a symbol of] death
78:5682 and made the night [its] cloak
78:5683 and made the day [a symbol of] life.
78:5684 And We have built above you seven firmaments,
78:5685 and have placed [therein the sun,] a lamp full of blazing splendour.
78:5686 And from the wind-driven clouds We send down waters pouring in abundance,
78:5687 so that We might bring forth thereby grain, and herbs,
78:5688 and gardens dense with follage.
78:5689 VERILY, the Day of Distinction [between the true and the false] has indeed its appointed time:
78:5690 the Day when the trumpet [of resurrection] is sounded and you all come forward in multitudes;
78:5691 and when the skies are opened and become [as wide-flung] gates;
78:5692 and when the mountains are made to vanish as if they had been a mirage.
78:5693 [On that Day,] verily, hell will lie in wait [for those who deny the truth] –
78:5694 a goal for all who are wont to transgress the bounds of what is right!
78:5695 In it shall they remain for a long time.
78:5696 Neither coolness shall they taste therein nor any [thirst-quenching] drink –
78:5697 only burning despair and ice-cold darkness:
78:5698 a meet requital [for their sins]!
78:5699 Behold, they were not expecting to be called to account,
78:5700 having given the lie to Our messages one and all:
78:5701 but We have placed on record every single thing [of what they did].
78:5702 [And so We shall say:] "Taste, then, [the fruit of your evil doings,] for now We shall bestow on you nothing but more and more suffering!"
78:5703 [But,] verily for the God-conscious there is supreme fulfilment in store:
78:5704 luxuriant gardens and vinyards,
78:5705 and splendid companions well matched,
78:5706 and a cup [of happiness] overflowing.
78:5707 No empty talk will they hear in that [paradise], nor any lie.
78:5708 [All this will be] a reward from thy Sustainer, a gift in accordance with [His Own] reckoning –
78:5709 [a reward from] the Sustainer of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, the Most Gracious! [And] none shall have it in their power to raise their voices unto Him
78:5710 on the Day when all [human] souls and all the angels will stand up in ranks: none will speak but he to whom the Most Gracious will have given leave; and [everyone] will say [only] what is right.
78:5711 That will be the Day of Ultimate Truth: whoever wills, then, let him take the path that leads towards his Sustainer!
78:5712 Verily, We have warned you of suffering near at hand - [suffering] on the Day when man shall [clearly] see what his hands have sent ahead, and when he who has denied the truth shall say, "Oh, would that I were mere dust...!"
