81:5801 WHEN THE SUN is shrouded in darkness,
81:5802 and when the stars lose their light,
81:5803 and when the mountains are made to vanish,
81:5804 and when she-camels big with young, about to give birth, are left untended,
81:5805 and when all beasts are gathered together,
81:5806 and when the seas boil over,
81:5807 and when all human beings are coupled [with their deeds],
81:5808 and when the girl-child that was buried alive is made to ask
81:5809 for what crime she had been slain,
81:5810 and when the scrolls [of men's deeds] are unfolded,
81:5811 and when heaven is laid bare,
81:5812 and when the blazing fire [of hell] is kindled bright,
81:5813 and when paradise is brought into view:
81:5814 [on that Day] every human being will come to know what he has prepared [for himself].
81:5815 BUT NAY! I call to witness the revolving stars,
81:5816 the planets that run their course and set,
81:5817 and the night as it darkly falls,
81:5818 and the morn as it softly breathes:
81:5819 behold, this [divine writ] is indeed the [inspired] word of a noble apostle,
81:5820 with strength endowed, secure with Him who in almightiness is enthroned
81:5821 [the word] of one to be heeded, and worthy of trust!
81:5822 For, this fellow-man of yours is not a madman:
81:5823 he truly beheld [the angel - beheld] him on the clear horizon;
81:5824 and he is not one to begrudge others the knowledge [of whatever has been revealed to him] out of that which is beyond the reach of human Perception.
81:5825 Nor is this [message] the word of any satanic force accursed.
81:5826 Whither, then, will you go?
81:5827 This [message] is no less than a reminder to all mankind â€“
81:5828 to everyone of you who wills to walk a straight way.
81:5829 But you cannot will it unless God, the Sustainer of all the worlds, wills [to show you that way].
