70:5376 ONE who is minded to ask might ask about the suffering which [in the hereafter] is bound to befall
70:5377 those who deny the truth. [Know, then, that] nothing can ward it off,
70:5378 [since it will come] from God, unto whom there are many ways of ascent:
70:5379 all the angels and all the inspiration [ever granted to man] ascend unto Him [daily,] in a day the length whereof is [like] fifty thousand years…
70:5380 Therefore, [O believer,] endure all adversity with goodly patience:
70:5381 behold, men look upon that [reckoning] as something far away –
70:5382 but, We see it as near!
70:5383 [It will take place] on a Day when the sky will be like molten lead,
70:5384 and the mountains will be like tufts of wool,
70:5385 and [when] no friend will ask about his friend,
70:5386 though they may be in one another's sight: [for,] everyone who was lost in sin will on that Day but desire to ransom himself from suffering at the price of his own children,
70:5387 and of his spouse, and of his brother,
70:5388 and of all the kinsfolk who ever sheltered him,
70:5389 and of whoever [else] lives on earth, all of them - so that he could but save himself.
70:5390 But nay! Verily, all [that awaits him] is a raging flame,
70:5391 tearing away his skin!
70:5392 It will claim all such as turn their backs [on what is right], and turn away [from the truth],
70:5393 and amass [wealth] and thereupon withhold [it from their fellow-men].
70:5394 VERILY, man is born with a restless disposition.
70:5395 [As a rule,] whenever misfortune touches him, he is filled with self-pity;
70:5396 and whenever good fortune comes to him, he selfishly withholds it [from others].
70:5397 Not so, however, those who consciously turn towards God in prayer.
70:5398 [and] who incessantly persevere in their prayer
70:5399 and in whose possessions there is a due share, acknowledged [by them],
70:5400 for such as ask [for help] and such as are deprived [of what is good in life];
70:5401 and who accept as true the [coming of the] Day of Judgment;
70:5402 and who stand in dread of their Sustainer's chastisement –
70:5403 for, behold, of their Sustainer's chastisement none may ever feel [wholly] secure;
70:5404 and who are mindful of their chastity,
70:5405 [not giving way to their desires] with any but their spouses - that is, those whom they rightfully possess [through wedlock] -: for then, behold, they are free of all blame,
70:5406 whereas such as seek to go beyond that [limit] are truly transgressors;
70:5407 and who are faithful to their trusts and to their pledges:
70:5408 and who stand firm whenever they bear witness;
70:5409 and who guard their prayers [from all worldly intent].
70:5410 These it is who in the gardens [of paradise] shall be honoured!
70:5411 WHAT, THEN, is amiss with such as are bent on denying the truth, that they run about confusedly to and fro before thee,
70:5412 [coming upon thee] from the right and from the left, in crowds?
70:5413 Does every one of them hope to enter [by this means] a garden of bliss?
70:5414 Never! For, behold, We have created them out of something that they know [only too well]!
70:5415 But nay! I call to witness [Our being] the Sustainer of all the points of sunrise and sunset: verily, well able are We
70:5416 to replace them with [people] better than they are; for there is nothing to prevent Us [from doing what We will].
70:5417 Hence, leave them to indulge in idle talk and play [with words] until they face that [Judgment] Day of theirs which they have been promised –
70:5418 the Day when they shall come forth in haste from their graves, as if racing towards a goal-post,
70:5419 with downcast eyes, with ignominy overwhelming them: that Day which they were promised again and…
