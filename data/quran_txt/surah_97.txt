97:6126 BEHOLD, from on high have We bestowed this [divine writ] on Night of Destiny.
97:6127 And what could make thee conceive what it is, that Night of Destiny?
97:6128 The Night of Destiny is better than a thousand months:
97:6129 in hosts descend in it the angels, bearing divine inspiration by their Sustainer's leave; from all [evil] that may happen
97:6130 does it make secure, until the rise of dawn.
