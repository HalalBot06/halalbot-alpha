54:4847 THE LAST HOUR draws near, and the moon is split asunder!
54:4848 But if they [who reject all thought of the Last Hour] were to see a sign [of its approach], they would turn aside and say, “An ever-recurring delusion!” –
54:4849 for they are bent on giving it the lie, being always wont to follow their own desires. Yet everything reveals its truth in the end.
54:4850 And withal, there has come unto them many a tiding that should have restrained [their arrogance]:
54:4851 far-reaching wisdom [was held out to them]: but [since] all warnings have been of no avail,
54:4852 turn thou away from them. On the Day when the Summoning Voice will sum­mon [man] unto something that the mind cannot conceive,
54:4853 they will come forth from their graves, with their eyes downcast, [swarming about] like locusts scattered [by the wind],
54:4854 running in con­fusion towards the Summoning Voice; [and] those who [now] deny the truth will exclaim, “Calamitous is this Day!”
54:4855 [LONG] BEFORE those [who now deny resurrec­tion] did Noah’s people call it a lie; and they gave the lie to Our servant and said, “Mad is he!” - and he was repulsed.
54:4856 Thereupon he called out to his Sustainer, “Verily, I am defeated; come Thou, then, to my succour!”
54:4857 And so We caused the gates of heaven to open with water pouring down in torrents,
54:4858 and caused the earth to burst forth with springs, so that the waters met for a purpose pre-ordained:
54:4859 but him We bore on that [vessel] made of [mere] planks and nails,
54:4860 and it floated under Our eyes: a recom­pense for him who had been rejected with ingratitude.
54:4861 And, indeed, We have caused such [floating vessels] to remain forever a sign [of Our grace unto man]: who, then, is willing to take it to heart?
54:4862 And how severe is the suffering which I inflict when My warnings are disregarded!
54:4863 Hence, indeed, We made this Qur’an easy to bear in mind: who, then, is willing to take it to heart?
54:4864 TO THE TRUTH gave the lie [the tribe of] Ad: and how severe was the suffering which I inflicted when My warnings were disregarded!
54:4865 Behold, We let loose upon them a raging storm wind on a day of bitter misfortune:
54:4866 it swept the people away as though they were palm-trunks uprooted:
54:4867 for, how severe is the suffering which I inflict when My warnings are disregarded!
54:4868 Hence, indeed, We made this Qur’an easy to bear in mind: who, then, is willing to take it to heart?
54:4869 [AND the tribe of] Thamud gave the lie to all [Our] warnings;
54:4870 and they said: “Are we to follow one single mortal, one from among ourselves? In that case, behold, we would certainly sink into error and folly!
54:4871 Why - on him alone from among all of us should a [divine] reminder have been bestowed? Nay, but he is a boastful liar!”
54:4872 [And God said:] “On the morrow they will come to know who the boastful liar is!
54:4873 Behold, [O Salih] We are letting loose this she-camel as a test for them; and thou but watch them, and contain thyself in patience.
54:4874 And let them know that the water [of their wells] is to be divided between them, with each share of water equitably apportioned.”
54:4875 But they summoned their [boldest] companion, and he ventured [upon the evil deed], and cruelly slaughtered [the animal]:
54:4876 and how severe was the suffering which I inflicted when My warnings were disregarded!
54:4877 Behold, We let loose upon them one single blast [of Our punishment], and they became like the dried-up, crumbling twigs of a sheepfold.
54:4878 Hence, indeed, We made this Qur’an easy to bear in mind: who, then, is willing to take it to heart?
54:4879 LOT ’S PEOPLE [too] gave the lie to all [Our] warn­ings:
54:4880 [and so,] behold, We let loose upon them a deadly tempest; and only Lot ’s kinsfolk did We save at the break of dawn,
54:4881 as a blessing from Us: thus do We reward all who are grateful.
54:4882 For he had truly warned them of Our punishing might; but they stubbornly cast doubt on these warn­ings,
54:4883 and even demanded that he give up his guests [to them]: whereupon We deprived them of their sight [and thus told them, as it were]: “Taste, then, the suffering which I inflict when My warnings are disregarded!”
54:4884 And, indeed, abiding suffering did befall them early on the morrow:
54:4885 “Taste, then, the suffering which I inflict when My warnings are disregarded!”
54:4886 Hence, indeed, We made this Qur’an easy to bear in mind: who, then, is willing to take it to heart?
54:4887 Now surely, unto Pharaoh’s folk [too] came such warnings;
54:4888 they, too, gave the lie to all Our messages: and thereupon We took them to task as only the Almighty, who determines all things, can take to task.
54:4889 ARE, THEN, those of you who [now] deny the truth better than those others - or have you, per­chance, [been promised] immunity in the [ancient] books of [divine] wisdom?
54:4890 Or do they say, “We are a group united, [and therefore] bound to prevail”?
54:4891 [Yet] the hosts [of those who deny the truth] shall be routed, and they shall turn their backs [in flight]!
54:4892 But nay - the Last Hour is the time when they shall truly meet their fate; and that Last Hour will be most calamitous, and most bitter:
54:4893 for, behold, those who are lost in sin [will at that time come to know that it is they who] were sunk in error and folly!
54:4894 On the Day when they shall be dragged into the fire on their faces, [they will be told:] “Taste now the touch of hell-fire!”
54:4895 BEHOLD, everything have We created in due measure and proportion;
54:4896 and Our ordaining [a thing and its coming into being] is but one [act], like the twinkling of an eye.
54:4897 Thus, indeed, did We destroy people like you [in the past]: who, then, is willing to take it to heart?
54:4898 [They were truly guilty] because all [the evil] that they ever did had been [revealed to them as such] in the [ancient] books of [divine] wisdom;
54:4899 and everything [that man does], be it small or great, is recorded [with God].
54:4900 [Hence, too,] behold, the God-conscious will find themselves in [a paradise of] gardens and running waters,
54:4901 in a seat of truth, in the presence of a Sovereign who determines all things.
