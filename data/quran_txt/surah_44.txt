44:4415 Ha. Mim.
44:4416 CONSIDER this divine writ, clear in itself and clearly showing the truth!
44:4417 Behold, from on high have We bestowed it on a blessed night: for, verily, We have always been warning [man].
44:4418 On that [night] was made clear, in wisdom, the distinction between all things [good and evil]
44:4419 at a behest from Ourselves: for, verily, We have always been sending [Our messages of guidance]
44:4420 in pur­suance of thy Sustainer’s grace [unto man]. Verily, He alone is all-hearing, all-knowing,
44:4421 the Sustainer of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them - if you could but grasp it with inner certainty!
44:4422 There is no deity save Him: He grants life and deals death: He is your Sustainer as well as the Sustainer of your forebears of old.
44:4423 Nay, but they [who lack inner certainty] are but Dying with their doubts.
44:4424 WAIT, THEN, for the Day when the skies shall bring forth a pall of smoke which will make obvious [the approach of the Last Hour],
44:4425 enveloping all mankind, [and causing the sinners to exclaim:] “Grievous is this suffering!
44:4426 O our Sustainer, relieve us of suffering, for, verily, we [now] believe [in Thee]!”
44:4427 [But] how shall this remembrance avail them [at the Last Hour], seeing that an apostle had pre­viously come unto them, clearly expounding the truth,
44:4428 whereupon they turned their backs on him and said, “Taught [by others] is he, a madman”?
44:4429 [Still,] behold, We shall postpone this suffer­ing for a little while, although you are bound to revert [to your evil ways: but]
44:4430 on the Day when We shall seize [all sinners] with a most mighty onslaught, We shall, verily, inflict Our retribution [on you as well]!
44:4431 AND, INDEED, [long] before their time did We try Pharaoh’s people [in the same way]: for there came unto them a noble apostle, [who said:]
44:4432 “Give in unto me, O God’s bondmen! Verily, I am an apostle [sent] unto you, worthy of trust!
44:4433 “And exalt not yourselves against God: for, verily, I come unto you with a manifest authority [from Him];
44:4434 and, behold, it is with my Sustainer - and your Sustainer - that I seek refuge against all your endeavours to revile me.
44:4435 And if you do not believe me, [at least] stand away from me!”
44:4436 But then, [when they beset him with their enmity,] he called out to his Sustainer, “These are [indeed] people lost in sin!”
44:4437 And [God said]: “Go thou forth with My servants by night, for you will surely be pursued;
44:4438 and leave the sea becalmed [between thee and Pharaoh’s men]: for, verily, they are a host destined to be drowned!”
44:4439 [And so they perished: and] how many gardens did they leave behind, and water-runnels,
44:4440 and fields of grain, and noble dwellings,
44:4441 and [all that] life of ease in which they used to delight!
44:4442 Thus it was. And [then] We made another people heirs [to what they had left],
44:4443 and neither sky nor earth shed tears over them, nor were they allowed a respite.
44:4444 And, indeed, We delivered the children of Israel from the shameful suffering
44:4445 [inflicted on them] by Pharaoh, seeing that he was truly outstand­ing among those who waste their own selves;
44:4446 and indeed, We chose them knowingly above all other people,
44:4447 and gave them such signs [of Our grace] as would clearly presage a test.
44:4448 [Now,] behold, these [people] say indeed:
44:4449 “That [which is ahead of us] is but our first [and only] death, and we shall not be raised to life again.
44:4450 So then, bring forth our forefathers [as witnesses], if what you claim is true!”
44:4451 Are they, then, better than the people of Tubba and those before them, whom We destroyed because they were truly lost in [the same] sin?
44:4452 For [thus it is:] We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in mere idle play:
44:4453 none of this have We created without [an inner] truth: but most of them under­stand it not.
44:4454 VERILY, the Day of Distinction [between the true and the false] is the term appointed for all of them:
44:4455 the Day when no friend shall be of the least avail to his friend, and when none shall be succoured
44:4456 save those upon whom God will have bestowed His grace and mercy: for, verily, He alone is almighty, a dispenser of grace.
44:4457 Verily, [in the life to come] the tree of deadly fruit
44:4458 will be the food of the sinful:
44:4459 like molten lead will it boil in the belly,
44:4460 like the boiling of burning despair.
44:4461 [And the word will be spoken:] “Seize him, [O you forces of hell,] and drag him into the midst of the blazing fire:
44:4462 then pour over his head the anguish of burning despair!
44:4463 Taste it - thou who [on earth] hast considered thyself so mighty, so noble!
44:4464 This is the very thing which you [deniers of the truth] were wont to call in question!”
44:4465 [As against this -] verily, the God-conscious will find themselves in a state secure,
44:4466 amid gardens and springs,
44:4467 wearing [garments] of silk and brocade, facing one another [in love].
44:4468 Thus shall it be. And We shall pair them with companions pure, most beautiful of eye.
44:4469 In that [paradise] they shall [rightfully] claim all the fruits [of their past deeds], resting in security;
44:4470 and neither shall they taste death there after having passed through their erstwhile death. Thus will He have preserved them from all suffer­ing through the blazing fire-
44:4471 an act of thy Sustainer’s favour: and that, that will be the triumph supreme!
44:4472 THUS, THEN, [O Prophet,] have We made this [divine writ] easy to understand, in thine own [human] tongue, so that men might take it to heart.
44:4473 So wait thou [for what the future will bring]: behold, they, too, are waiting.
