94:6091 HAVE WE NOT opened up thy heart,
94:6092 and lifted from thee the burden
94:6093 that had weighed so heavily on thy back?
94:6094 And [have We not] raised thee high in dignity?
94:6095 And, behold, with every hardship comes ease:
94:6096 verily, with every hardship comes ease!
94:6097 Hence, when thou art freed [from distress], remain steadfast,
94:6098 and unto thy Sustainer turn with love.
