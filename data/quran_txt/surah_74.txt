74:5496 O THOU [in thy solitude] enfolded!
74:5497 Arise and warn!
74:5498 And thy Sustainer's greatness glorify!
74:5499 And thine inner self purify!
74:5500 And all defilement shun!
74:5501 And do not through giving seek thyself to gain,
74:5502 but unto thy Sustainer turn in patience.
74:5503 And [warn all men that] when the trumpet-call [of resurrection] is sounded,
74:5504 that very Day shall be a day of anguish,
74:5505 not of ease, for all who [now] deny the truth!
74:5506 LEAVE Me alone [to deal] with him whom I have created alone,
74:5507 and to whom I have granted resources vast,
74:5508 and children as [love's] witnesses,
74:5509 and to whose life I gave so wide a scope:
74:5510 and yet, he greedily desires that I give yet more!
74:5511 Nay, verily, it is against Our messages that he knowingly, stubbornly sets himself
74:5512 [and so] I shall constrain him to endure a painful uphill climb!
74:5513 Behold, [when Our messages are conveyed to one who is bent on denying the truth,] he reflects and meditates [as to how to disprove them] –
74:5514 and thus he destroys himself, the way he meditates:
74:5515 yea, he destroys himself, the way he meditates!
74:5516 and then he looks [around for new arguments],
74:5517 and then he frowns and glares,
74:5518 and in the end he turns his back [on Our message], and glories in his arrogance,
74:5519 and says, "All this is mere spellbinding eloquence handed down [from olden times]!
74:5520 This is nothing but the word of mortal man!"
74:5521 [Hence,] I shall cause him to endure hell-fire [in the life to come]!
74:5522 And what could make thee conceive what hell-fire is?
74:5523 It does not allow to live, and neither leaves [to die],
74:5524 making [all truth] visible to mortal man.
74:5525 Over it are nineteen [powers].
74:5526 For We have caused none but angelic powers to lord over the fire [of hell]; and We have not caused their number to be aught but a trial for those who are bent on denying the truth - to the end that they who have been granted revelation aforetime might be convinced [of the truth of this divine writ]; and that they who have attained to faith [in it] might grow yet more firm in their faith; and that [both] they who have been granted the earlier revelation and they who believe [in this one] might be freed of all doubt; and that they in whose hearts is disease and the who deny the truth outright might ask, "What does [your] God mean by this parable?" In this way God lets go astray him that wills [to go astray], and guides aright him that wills [to be guided]. And none can comprehend thy Sustainers forces save Him alone: and all this is but a reminder to mortal man.
74:5527 NAY, but consider the moon!
74:5528 Consider the night when it departs,
74:5529 and the morn when it dawns!
74:5530 Verily, that [hell-fire) is Indeed one of the great [forewarnings] –
74:5531 a warning to mortal man –
74:5532 to everyone of you, whether he chooses to come forward or to hang back!
74:5533 [On the Day of Judgment,] every human being will be held in pledge for whatever [evil] he has wrought –
74:5534 save those who shall have attained to righteousness:
74:5535 [dwelling] In gardens [of paradise], they will inquire
74:5536 of those who were lost in sin:
74:5537 "What has brought you into hell-fire?"
74:5538 They will answer: "We were not among those who prayed;
74:5539 and neither did we feed the needy;
74:5540 and we were wont to indulge in sinning together with all [the others] who indulged in it;
74:5541 and the Day of Judgment we were wont to call a lie –
74:5542 until certainty came upon us [in death]."
74:5543 And so, of no benefit to them could be the intercession of any that would intercede for them.
74:5544 WHAT, THEN, is amiss with them that they turn away from all admonition
74:5545 as though they were terrified asses
74:5546 fleeing from a lion?
74:5547 Yea, everyone of them claims that he [himself] ought to have been given revelations unfolded!
74:5548 Nay, but they do not [believe in and, hence, do not] fear the life to come.
74:5549 Nay, verily, this is an admonition –
74:5550 and whoever wills may take it to heart.
74:5551 But they [who do not believe in the life to come] will not take it to heart unless God so wills: [for] He is the Fount of all God-consciousness, and the Fount of all forgiveness.
