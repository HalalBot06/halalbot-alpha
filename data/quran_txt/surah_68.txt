68:5272 Nun. CONSIDER the pen, and all that they write [therewith]!
68:5273 Thou art not, by thy Sustainer's grace, a madman!
68:5274 And, verily, thine shall be a reward neverending –
68:5275 for, behold, thou keepest indeed to a sublime way of life;
68:5276 and [one day] thou shalt see, and they [who now deride thee] shall see,
68:5277 which of you was bereft of reason.
68:5278 Verily, thy Sustainer alone is fully aware as to who has strayed from His path, Just as He alone is fully aware of those who have found the right way.
68:5279 Hence, defer not to [the likes and dislikes of] those who give the lie to the truth:
68:5280 they would like thee to be soft [with them], so that they might be soft [with thee].
68:5281 Furthermore, defer not to the contemptible swearer of oaths,
68:5282 [or to] the slanderer that goes about with defaming tales,
68:5283 [or] the withholder of good, [or] the sinful aggressor,
68:5284 [or] one who is cruel, by greed possessed, and, in addition to all this, utterly useless [to his fellow-men].
68:5285 Is it because he is possessed of worldly goods and children
68:5286 that, whenever Our messages are conveyed to him, such a one says, "Fables of ancient times"?
68:5287 [For this] We shall brand him with indelible disgrace!
68:5288 [As for such sinners,] behold, We [but] try them as We tried the owners of a certain garden who vowed that they would surely harvest its fruit on the morrow,
68:5289 and made no allowance [for the will of God]:
68:5290 whereupon a visitation for thy Sustainer came upon that [garden] while they were asleep,
68:5291 so that by the morrow it became barren and bleak.
68:5292 Now when they rose at early morn, they called unto one another,
68:5293 "Go early to your tilth if you want to harvest the fruit!"
68:5294 Thus they launched forth, whispering unto one another,
68:5295 "Indeed, no needy person shall enter it today [and come] upon you [unawares],"
68:5296 – and early they went, strongly bent upon their purpose.
68:5297 But as soon as they beheld [the garden and could not recognize] it, they exclaimed, "Surely we have lost our way!"
68:5298 - [and then,] "Nay, but we have been rendered destitute!"
68:5299 Said the most right-minded among them: "Did I not tell you, 'Will you not extol God's limitless glory?’"
68:5300 They answered: "Limitless in His glory is our Sustainer! Verily, we were doing wrong!"
68:5301 - and then they turned upon one another with mutual reproaches.
68:5302 [In the end] they said: "Oh, woe unto us! Verily, we did behave outrageously!
68:5303 [But] it may be that our Sustainer will grant us something better instead: for, verily, unto our Sustainer do we turn with hope!"
68:5304 SUCH is the suffering [with which We try some people in this world]; but greater by far will be the suffering [which sinners shall have to bear] in the life to come - if they but knew it!
68:5305 For, behold, it is the God-conscious [alone] whom gardens of bliss await with their Sustainer:
68:5306 or should We, perchance, treat those who surrender themselves unto Us as [We would treat] those who remain lost in sin?
68:5307 What is amiss with you? On what do you base your judgment [of right and wrong]?
68:5308 Or have you, perchance, a [special] divine writ which you study,
68:5309 and in which you find all that you may wish to find?
68:5310 Or have you received a solemn promise, binding on Us till Resurrection Day, that yours will assuredly be whatever you judge [to be your rightful due]?
68:5311 Ask them which of them is able to vouch for this!
68:5312 Or have they, perchance, any sages to support their views? Well, then, if they are sincere in this their claim, let them produce those supporters of theirs
68:5313 on the Day when man's very being shall be bared to the bone, and when they [who now deny the truth] shall be called upon to prostrate themselves [before God], and shall be unable to do so:
68:5314 downcast will be their eyes, with ignominy overwhelming them - seeing that they had been called upon [in vain] to prostrate themselves [before Him] while they were yet sound [and alive].
68:5315 Hence, leave Me alone with such as give the lie to this tiding. We shall bring them low, step by step, without their perceiving how it has come about:
68:5316 for, behold, though I may give them rein for a while, My subtle scheme is exceedingly firm!
68:5317 Or is it that [they fear lest] thou ask them for a reward, [O Prophet,] so that they would be burdened with debt [if they listened to thee]?
68:5318 Or [do they think] that the hidden reality [of all that exists] is within their grasp, so that [in time] they can write it down?
68:5319 BEAR THEN with patience thy Sustainer's will and be not like him of the great fish, who cried out [in distress] after having given in to anger.
68:5320 [And remember:] had not grace from his Sustainer reached him, he would indeed have been cast forth upon that barren shore in a state of disgrace:
68:5321 but [as it was,] his Sustainer had elected him and placed him among the righteous.
68:5322 Hence, [be patient,] even though they who are bent on denying the truth would all but kill thee with their eyes whenever they hear this reminder, and [though] they say, "[As for Muhammad,] behold, most surely he is a madman!"
68:5323 [Be patient:] for this is nought else but a reminder [from God] to all mankind.
