107:6198 HAST THOU ever considered [the kind of man] who gives the lie to all moral law?
107:6199 Behold, it is this [kind of man] that thrusts the orphan away,
107:6200 and feels no urge to feed the needy.
107:6201 Woe, then, unto those praying ones
107:6202 whose hearts from their prayer are remote
107:6203 those who want only to be seen and praised,
107:6204 and, withal, deny all assistance [to their fellow-men]!
