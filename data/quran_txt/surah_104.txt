104:6180 WOE unto every slanderer, fault-finder!
104:6181 [Woe unto him who amasses wealth and counts it a safeguard,
104:6182 thinking that his wealth will make him live forever!
104:6183 Nay, but [in the life to come such as] he shall indeed be abandoned to crushing torment!
104:6184 And what could make thee conceive what that crushing torment will be?
104:6185 A fire kindled by God,
104:6186 which will rise over the [guilty] hearts:
104:6187 verily, it will close in upon them
104:6188 in endless columns!
