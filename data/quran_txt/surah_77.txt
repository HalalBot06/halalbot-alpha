77:5623 CONSIDER these [messages,] sent forth in waves
77:5624 and then storming on with a tempest's force!
77:5625 Consider these [messages] that spread [the truth] far and wide,
77:5626 thus separating [right and wrong] with all clarity,
77:5627 and then giving forth a reminder,
77:5628 [promising] freedom from blame or [offering] a warning!
77:5629 BEHOLD, all that you are told to expect will surely come to pass.
77:5630 Thus, [it will come to pass] when the stars are effaced,
77:5631 and when the sky is rent asunder,
77:5632 and when the mountains are scattered like dust,
77:5633 and when all the apostles are called together at a time appointed...
77:5634 For what day has the term [of all this] been set?
77:5635 For the Day of Distinction [between the true and the false]!
77:5636 And what could make thee conceive what that Day of Distinction will be?
77:5637 Woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth!
77:5638 Did We not destroy [so many of] those [sinners] of olden days?
77:5639 And We shall let them be followed by those of later times:
77:5640 [for] thus do We deal with such as are lost in sin.
77:5641 Woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth!
77:5642 Did We not create you out of a humble fluid
77:5643 which We then let remain in [the womb's] firm keeping
77:5644 for a term pre-ordained?
77:5645 Thus have We determined [the nature of man's creation]: and excellent indeed is Our power to determine [what is to be]!
77:5646 Woe, on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth!
77:5647 Have We not caused the earth to hold within itself
77:5648 the living and the dead?
77:5649 and have We not set on it proud, firm mountains, and given you sweet water to drink?
77:5650 Woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth!
77:5651 GO ON towards that [resurrection] which you were wont to call a lie!
77:5652 Go on towards the threefold shadow
77:5653 that will offer no [cooling] shade and will be of no avail against the flame
77:5654 which – behold!- will throw up sparks like [burning] logs,
77:5655 like giant fiery ropes!
77:5656 Woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth –
77:5657 that Day on which they will not [be able to] utter a word,
77:5658 nor be allowed to proffer excuses!
77:5659 Woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth –
77:5660 that Day of Distinction [between the true and the false, when they will be told]: "We have brought you together with those [sinners] of olden times;
77:5661 and if you [think that you] have a subterfuge left, try to outwit Me!"
77:5662 Woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth!
77:5663 [AS AGAINST this,] behold, the God-conscious shall dwell amidst [cooling] shades and springs,
77:5664 and [partake of] whatever fruit they may desire;
77:5665 [and they will be told:] "Eat and drink in good cheer in return for what you did [in life]!"
77:5666 Thus, behold, do We reward the doers of good;
77:5667 [but] woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth!
77:5668 EAT [your fill] and enjoy your life for a little while, O you who are lost in sin!
77:5669 [But] woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth,
77:5670 and when they are told, "Bow down [before God]", do not bow down:
77:5671 woe on that Day unto those who give the to the truth!
77:5672 In what other tiding, then, will they, after this, believe?
