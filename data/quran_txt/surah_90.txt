90:6024 NAY! I call to witness this land –
90:6025 this land in which thou art free to dwell -
90:6026 and [I call to witness] parent and offspring:
90:6027 Verily, We have created man into [a life of] pain, toil and trial.
90:6028 Does he, then, think that no one has power over him?
90:6029 He boasts, "I have spent wealth abundant!"
90:6030 Does he, then, think that no one sees him?
90:6031 Have We not given him two eyes,
90:6032 and a tongue, and a pair of lips,
90:6033 and shown him the two highways [of good and evil]?
90:6034 But he would not try to ascend the steep uphill road...
90:6035 And what could make thee conceive what it is, that steep uphill road?
90:6036 [It is] the freeing of one's neck [from the burden of sin],
90:6037 or the feeding, upon a day of [one's own] hunger,
90:6038 of an orphan near of kin,
90:6039 or of a needy [stranger] lying in the dust –
90:6040 and being, withal, of those who have attained to faith, and who enjoin upon one another patience in adversity, and enjoin upon one another compassion.
90:6041 Such are they that have attained to righteousness;
90:6042 whereas those who are bent on denying the truth of Our messages – they are such as have lost themselves in evil,
90:6043 [with] fire closing in upon them.
