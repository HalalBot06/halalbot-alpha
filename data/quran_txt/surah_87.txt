87:5949 EXTOL the limitless glory of thy Sustainer's name: [the glory of] the Al-Highest,
87:5950 who creates [every thing], and thereupon forms it in accordance with what it is meant to be,
87:5951 and who determines the nature [of all that exists], and thereupon guides it [towards its fulfilment],
87:5952 and who brings forth herbage,
87:5953 and thereupon causes it to decay into rust-brown stubble!
87:5954 WE SHALL teach thee, and thou wilt not forget [aught of what thou art taught],
87:5955 save what God may will [thee to forget] - for, verily, He [alone] knows all that is open to [man's] perception as well as all that is hidden [from it]
87:5956 and [thus] shall We make easy for thee the path towards [ultimate] ease.
87:5957 REMIND, THEN, [others of the truth, regardless of] whether this reminding [would seem to] be of use [or not]:
87:5958 in mind will keep it he who stands in awe [of God],
87:5959 but aloof from it will remain that most hapless wretch –
87:5960 he who [in the life to come] shall have to endure the great fire
87:5961 wherein he will neither die nor remain alive.
87:5962 To happiness [in the life to come] will indeed attain he who attains to purity [in this world],
87:5963 and remembers his Sustainer's name, and prays [unto Him].
87:5964 But nay, [O men,] you prefer the life of this world,
87:5965 although the life to come is better and more enduring.
87:5966 Verily, [all] this has indeed been [said] in the earlier revelations –
87:5967 the revelations of Abraham and Moses.
