55:4904 He has created man:
55:4905 He has imparted unto him articulate thought and speech.
55:4906 [At His behest] the sun and the moon run their appointed courses;

55:4908 And the skies has He raised high, and has devised [for all things] a measure,
55:4909 so that you [too, O men,] might never transgress the measure [of what is right]:
55:4910 weigh, therefore, [your deeds] with equity, and cut not the measure short!
55:4911 And the earth has He spread out for all living beings,
55:4912 with fruit thereon, and palm trees with sheathed clusters [of dates],
55:4913 and grain growing tall on its stalks, and sweet-smelling plants.
55:4914 Which, then, of your Sustainer’s powers can you disavow?
