93:6080 CONSIDER the bright morning hours,
93:6081 and the night when it grows still and dark.
93:6082 Thy Sustainer has not forsaken thee, nor does He scorn thee:
93:6083 for, indeed, the life to come will be better for thee than this earlier part [of thy life]!
93:6084 And, indeed, in time will thy Sustainer grant thee [what thy heart desires], and thou shalt be well-pleased.
93:6085 Has He not found thee an orphan, and given thee shelter?
93:6086 And found thee lost on thy way, and guided thee?
93:6087 And found thee in want, and given thee sufficiency?
93:6088 Therefore, the orphan shalt thou never wrong,
93:6089 and him that seeks [thy] help shalt thou never chide,
93:6090 and of thy Sustainer's blessings shalt thou [ever] speak.
