82:5830 WHEN THE SKY is cleft asunder,
82:5831 and when the stars are scattered,
82:5832 and when the seas burst beyond their bounds,
82:5833 and when the graves are overturned –
82:5834 every human being will [at last] comprehend, what he has sent ahead and what he has held back [in this world].
82:5835 O MAN! What is it that lures thee away from thy bountiful Sustainer,
82:5836 who has created thee, and formed thee in accordance with what thou art meant' to be, and shaped thy nature in just proportions,
82:5837 having put thee together in whatever form He willed [thee to have]?
82:5838 Nay, [O men,] but you [are lured away from God whenever you are tempted to] give the lie to [God’s] Judgment!
82:5839 And yet, verily, there are ever-watchful forces over you,
82:5840 noble, recording,
82:5841 aware of whatever you do!
82:5842 Behold, [in the life to come] the truly virtuous: will indeed be in bliss,
82:5843 whereas, behold, the wicked will indeed be in a blazing fire –
82:5844 [a fire] which they shall enter on Judgment Day,
82:5845 and which they shall not [be able to] evade.
82:5846 And what could make thee conceive what that Judgment Day will be?
82:5847 And once again: What could make thee conceive what that Judgment Day will be?
82:5848 [It will be] a Day when no human being shall be of the least avail to another human being: for on that Day [it will become manifest that] all sovereignty is God's alone.
