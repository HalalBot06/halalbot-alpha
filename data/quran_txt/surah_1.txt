1:1 In the name of God, The Most Gracious, The Dispenser of Grace:
1:2 All praise is due to God alone, the Sustainer of all the worlds,
1:3 The Most Gracious, the Dispenser of Grace,
1:4 Lord of the Day of Judgment!
1:5 Thee alone do we worship; and unto Thee alone do we turn for aid.
1:6 Guide us the straight way.
1:7 The way of those upon whom Thou hast bestowed Thy blessings, not of those who have been condemned [by Thee], nor of those who go astray!
