101:6158 OH, the sudden calamity!
101:6159 How awesome the sudden calamity!
101:6160 And what could make thee conceive what that sudden calamity will be?
101:6161 [It will occur] on the Day when men will be like moths swarming in confusion,
101:6162 and the mountains will be like fluffy tufts of wool....
101:6163 And then, he whose weight [of good deeds] is heavy in the balance
101:6164 shall find himself in a happy' state of life;
101:6165 whereas he whose weight is light in the balance
101:6166 shall be engulfed by an abyss.
101:6167 And what could make thee conceive what that [abyss] will be?
101:6168 A fire hotly burning!
