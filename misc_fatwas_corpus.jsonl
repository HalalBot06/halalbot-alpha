{"question": "What is the Islamic ruling on women plucking their eyebrows?", "answer": "Answered by: Dr. Yasir Qadhi Answer: In the Name of All\u0101h\u00a0\ufdfb, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. All praise is due to All\u0101h\u00a0\ufdfb, and may peace and blessings be upon His Messenger Mu\u1e25ammad\u00a0\ufdfa. The primary evidence cited regarding the prohibition of plucking eyebrows is a narration of Ibn Mas\u02bf\u016bd (r\u1e0da), where he mentions that the Prophet\u00a0\ufdfa\u00a0cursed: women who tattooed and those women who have themselves tattooed, \u201cal-mutanami\u1e63\u0101\u1e6d\u201d (women who have their eyebrows plucked), and women who make spaces between their teeth for beautification, those who change the creation of All\u0101h\u00a0\ufdfb. [Muttafaq \u02bfAlayh] 1 From the earliest times, Islamic scholarship has exhibited a spectrum of views regarding this issue. Some scholars, following the literal meaning, believe the\u00a0\u1e25ad\u012bth should be unconditionally applied, thereby deeming the act of plucking eyebrows as completely forbidden. This view is notably upheld by Ibn Mas\u02bf\u016bd (r\u1e0da), the narrator of the\u00a0\u1e25ad\u012bth, who adhered strictly to its apparent meaning. Conversely,\u00a0\u02bf\u0100ishah (r\u1e0da), despite also being a narrator of a similar version of this\u00a0\u1e25ad\u012bth, permitted plucking the eyebrows, saying \u201cYou may remove anything that irritates you\u201d. 2 It is important to look into the context behind such narrations. The curse (la\u02bfnah) of All\u0101h\u00a0\ufdfb\u00a0is found to only be associated with major sins, such as murder and idol-worship. This poses a question: Why would plucking the eyebrows be a major sin that is deserving of All\u0101h\u00a0\ufdfb\u2019s curse? This question was asked by Al-Qar\u0101f\u012b 3 and Ibn\u00a0\u02bf\u0100sh\u016br, among other scholars. Ibn\u00a0\u02bf\u0100sh\u016br explains that these characteristics appear to be associated with the prostitutes of the time, who would do such things to show themselves off and advertise their profession. 4 That is why All\u0101h\u00a0\ufdfb\u2019s curse is associated with this act \u2013 prostitution is something that destroys the moral fabric of society. Ibn al-Jawz\u012b, the famous\u00a0\u1e24anbal\u012b\u00a0scholar, also mentions three possible reasons: The characteristics mentioned in the\u00a0\u1e25ad\u012bth were associated with immoral women, or were referring to women who changed the way they look to deceive potential suitors, or the curse is only associated with those specific acts that involve changing All\u0101h\u00a0\ufdfb\u2019s creation, such as tattooing. 5 \u1e24anbal\u012b\u00a0scholars such as Im\u0101m A\u1e25mad and Ibn Qud\u0101mah mention that this prohibition is specific to plucking, but there is no issue with shaving the eyebrows. 6 Additionally, the great scholar\u00a0\u02bfAbdul Q\u0101dir al-J\u012bl\u0101n\u012b\u00a0allows for shaping the eyebrows for the sake of the husband because there is a clear benefit to be gained from it. 7 This opinion is supported by scholars across all four schools; Al-M\u0101ward\u012b, Al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, and Ibn\u00a0\u1e24ajar from the Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b\u00a0school and al-Q\u0101\u1e0d\u012b \u02bfIy\u0101\u1e0d\u00a0and Al-\u02bfAdaw\u012b\u00a0from the M\u0101lik\u012b\u00a0school permit plucking the eyebrows to please the husband, and even in the\u00a0\u1e24anaf\u012b school, Fat\u0101w\u0101\u00a0Hindiyyah allows it. In conclusion, while many scholars did wish to stick with the explicit literal meaning of this \u1e25ad\u012bth (and this religious spirit should be appreciated), it does appear that the real issue is not the plucking itself, but rather its association at the time with other immoral acts. Since this association no longer exists in our time, and based on the opinions of a number of authorities of the past, it would be permissible for a wife to beautify herself for her husband in this manner.

{"question": "What is the Islamic ruling about lowering the pants beneath the ankles?", "answer": "Answered by: Dr. Yasir Qadhi Answer: In the Name of All\u0101h \ufdfb, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. All praise is due to All\u0101h, and may peace and blessings be upon His Messenger Mu\u1e25ammad \ufdfa. The Prophet \ufdfa said, \u201cAll\u0101h \ufdfb will not look at the one who lowers his garment out of pride.\u201d 1 He \ufdfa also said, \u201cWhatever is below the ankles from the iz\u0101r (lower garment) is in the fire.\u201d 2 Reports of this nature are found in all the major \u1e25ad\u012bth collections. As a result, there is complete consensus among the scholars that whoever lowers his garment out of pride has committed a major sin. In every society, people invent ways to show off their wealth. In our times, designer clothes are an example. The prohibition of lowering garments out of pride has to do with how people showed off their wealth in the Prophet \ufdfa\u2019s time. In that era, cloth was scarce, and the environment was dirty and dusty. Normal people would wear their clothes above their ankles out of common sense to prevent their clothes from getting dirty, especially because they might not have other clothes. In fact, the Prophet \ufdfa and the \u1e62a\u1e25\u0101bah had a maximum of around two or three pairs of clothes! On the other hand, wealthy and prideful people would let their clothes hang all the way below their ankles as a way of sticking out from the crowd and showing off that they had lots of wealth and clothes and did not need to worry about getting their clothes dirty. This is why Isl\u0101m prohibited this action when done out of pride. All\u0101h \ufdfb says, \u201cIndeed, All\u0101h \ufdfb does not like those who are arrogant and boastful\u201d [S\u016brah Luqm\u0101n, \u0100yah 18]. However, within a century of the Prophet \ufdfa, wealth increased among the Muslims. Clothes and other luxuries were no longer considered luxuries. Therefore, people did not worry as much about dirtying their clothes and started wearing clothes below the ankles simply because they could. It was no longer a way of showing off wealth. As a result, within the earliest generations, scholars stated that these a\u1e25\u0101d\u012bth apply to a society where lowering garments is a sign of pride. Even though some a\u1e25\u0101d\u012bth do not mention the condition of pride for the prohibition, many clearly do. This reality led to a near consensus among almost all scholars that the prohibition does not apply when people do it out of culture, due to habit, or because of any reason other than pride. Evidence for this is the report of Ab\u016b Bakr (r\u1e0da) when he heard about the prohibition. He said to the Prophet \ufdfa, \u201cO Messenger of All\u0101h \ufdfa, one side of my iz\u0101r (lower cloth) hangs low if I do not take care of it.\u201d The Prophet \ufdfa replied, \u201cYou are not from those who do it out of pride.\u201d 3 Note how the Prophet \ufdfa did not say \u201cYou do it accidentally.\u201d Instead, he \ufdfa excused him by saying he does not do it out of pride. As a result, in a society where hanging the garments is not used to show off at all and has nothing to do with pride, the prohibition does not apply. There is also evidence from the actions of the \u1e62a\u1e25\u0101bah. The companion \u02bfAbdull\u0101h ibn Mas\u02bf\u016bd (r\u1e0da) had shins that were thin and curved. When Ibn Mas\u02bf\u016bd was living in Kufa after the wealth of Muslims had increased, his students saw him wearing low garments that covered his ankles. They asked him why he lowered them despite narrating a report about its prohibition. He responded, \u201cI am a man that has thin shins.\u201d 4 This shows that he wished to cover his shins to prevent people from mocking him about their appearance. If lowering the garments were always prohibited according to Ibn Mas\u02bf\u016bd, his excuse would not be a valid excuse: prohibited matters do not become \u1e24al\u0101l due to fear of mockery. A number of reports from the early generations indicates this. In one, Im\u0101m Ab\u016b \u1e24an\u012bfah (r\u1e25)\u2019s students saw him wearing low garments. They asked him, \u201cAren\u2019t we prohibited from doing that?\u201d He responded, \u201cThat is only for those who do it out of pride, and we are not from among them.\u201d 5 In another, Ayy\u016bb as-Sikhtiy\u0101n\u012b (a major t\u0101bi\u02bf\u012b scholar who died in 130AH) was asked why he lowered his garment despite narrating reports to the contrary. He responded, \u201cIn the past, showing off was to lower the garments (below the ankles). In our times, showing off is to raise the garment (above the ankles).\u201d 6 He meant that some people used raising the garment as a way of showing off or pretending they were more pious than others. (Of course it should be emphasized that one should not doubt the sincerity of people who follow this hadith out of love for the Sunnah.) All four schools of thought hold the position that it is only prohibited or sinful to lower the garment below the ankles for those who do it out of pride. 7 This was also the view of Ibn Taymiyyah. 8 So, in this society and culture where lowering the garments is not used for showing off, the prohibition does not apply. There is an alternate opinion held by some scholars that lowering the garments is sinful whether it is done out of pride or not, 9 but this view is held by a very small minority. We respect those who follow the opinion of prohibition, but no one should claim it is the only interpretation or even the dominant interpretation. That view is also not practical for most people to apply. In conclusion, lowering garments below the ankles out of pride, especially in a society that uses low garments as a way of showing off, is prohibited by the consensus of the scholars. However, lowering pants below the ankles in modern society is not sinful or \u1e24ar\u0101m because it is not considered a way of showing off. This is the view of the vast majority of scholars. And All\u0101h \ufdfb knows best.

They asked him why he lowered them despite narrating a report about its prohibition. He responded, \u201cI am a man that has thin shins.\u201d 4 This shows that he wished to cover his shins to prevent people from mocking him about their appearance. If lowering the garments were always prohibited according to Ibn Mas\u02bf\u016bd, his excuse would not be a valid excuse: prohibited matters do not become \u1e24al\u0101l due to fear of mockery. A number of reports from the early generations indicates this. In one, Im\u0101m Ab\u016b \u1e24an\u012bfah (r\u1e25)\u2019s students saw him wearing low garments. They asked him, \u201cAren\u2019t we prohibited from doing that?\u201d He responded, \u201cThat is only for those who do it out of pride, and we are not from among them.\u201d 5 In another, Ayy\u016bb as-Sikhtiy\u0101n\u012b (a major t\u0101bi\u02bf\u012b scholar who died in 130AH) was asked why he lowered his garment despite narrating reports to the contrary. He responded, \u201cIn the past, showing off was to lower the garments (below the ankles). In our times, showing off is to raise the garment (above the ankles).\u201d 6 He meant that some people used raising the garment as a way of showing off or pretending they were more pious than others. (Of course it should be emphasized that one should not doubt the sincerity of people who follow this hadith out of love for the Sunnah.) All four schools of thought hold the position that it is only prohibited or sinful to lower the garment below the ankles for those who do it out of pride. 7 This was also the view of Ibn Taymiyyah. 8 So, in this society and culture where lowering the garments is not used for showing off, the prohibition does not apply. There is an alternate opinion held by some scholars that lowering the garments is sinful whether it is done out of pride or not, 9 but this view is held by a very small minority. We respect those who follow the opinion of prohibition, but no one should claim it is the only interpretation or even the dominant interpretation. That view is also not practical for most people to apply. In conclusion, lowering garments below the ankles out of pride, especially in a society that uses low garments as a way of showing off, is prohibited by the consensus of the scholars. However, lowering pants below the ankles in modern society is not sinful or \u1e24ar\u0101m because it is not considered a way of showing off. This is the view of the vast majority of scholars. And All\u0101h \ufdfb knows best.

{"question": "What are the cases where backbiting is permissible?", "answer": "Answered by: Dr. Yasir Qadhi Answer: In the Name of All\u0101h\u00a0\ufdfb, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. All praise is due to All\u0101h\u00a0\ufdfb, and may peace and blessings be upon His Messenger Mu\u1e25ammad\u00a0\ufdfa. Backbiting (gh\u012bbah) is defined by our Prophet \ufdfa as \u0630\u0650\u0643\u0652\u0631\u064f\u0643\u064e \u0623\u064e\u062e\u064e\u0627\u0643\u064e \u0628\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u0643\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0647, \u201cmentioning something about your brother [behind his back] which he does not like.\u201d [\u1e62a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25 Muslim] 1 This is when one mentions something embarrassing, awkward, or private about someone else while not in their presence. The term backbiting is used when the statement is truthful, and the term slander is used if it is a lie. As for slander, it is completely prohibited in all cases. Backbiting is also prohibited, however, there are certain cases where it becomes permissible due to necessity: All scholars agree that backbiting is permissible when dhulm (oppression) has taken place. This is based on All\u0101h \ufdfb\u2019s statement, \u201cAll\u0101h does not like the public mention of evil except by one who has been wronged.\u201d 2 This means that if someone has been wronged, stolen from, hurt, or has had any of their rights infringed upon, and in the course of procuring their rights they must mention negative aspects about another person, it is permissible to mention such matters to those in a position of authority, even if that entails backbiting. Many scholars have mentioned that backbiting is permissible when warning about a generic public evil. This could be a person whose presence is evil and causes harm to the public, such as a drug dealer. Such a person has no sanctity, and warning against them is a form of protecting the Muslim community. Another exception to backbiting is when one is consulted with someone about a specific person, such as a potential business partner or potential spouse (this is called istish\u0101rah). This is seen in the \u1e25ad\u012bth of F\u0101\u1e6dimah bint Qays where she asked the Prophet \ufdfa whether she should marry Mu\u02bf\u0101wiyah (r\u1e0da), or Ab\u016b Jahm (r\u1e0da). He \ufdfa said, \u201cAs for Mu\u02bf\u0101wiyah, he is a poor man without any property, and as for Ab\u016b Jahm, he often hits women\u201d [\u1e62a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25 Muslim]. 3 These are negative qualities about the two men that the Prophet \ufdfa mentioned while they were not present, proving the exception for istish\u0101rah. Another issue prevalent in our communities is when someone talks about their personal experiences involving another person. In this case, the permissibility depends on the intention. If the purpose is to gossip or to shame the person, it is clearly impermissible. However, if someone does this to seek advice, ask for help, or for some greater good, it is permissible if that is the sole intention. In conclusion, while certain circumstances permit backbiting, the default is that it is a major sin, likened in the Qur\u2019\u0101n to consuming the flesh of one\u2019s deceased brother. 4 The above-listed exceptions to the default prohibition should be approached with utmost caution and responsibility.

{"question": "Unknown question", "answer": "Amount of Fidyah and Zak\u0101t al-Fi\u1e6dr All praise is due to Allah, and may peace and salutations be upon the Prophet \ufdfa. SUMMARY Fidyah amount is recommended to be $15 in 2025, and the Zak\u0101t al-Fi\u1e6dr amount is recommended to be $10. DETAILS OF FIDYAH Fidyah is a payment made per missed fast if someone is not able to fast in Rama\u1e0d\u0101n, and it is expected that they will never regain the ability to make up for the missed fasts \u2014 for example, if they are sick with no hope of recovery. If someone misses a fast due to being temporarily sick or traveling, they would make up the fast at a later date and they would not pay fidyah. The fidyah amount is \u201c \u1e6da\u02bb\u0101mu misk\u012bn \u201d (Qur\u2019\u0101n, 2:184), or \u201cfeeding a poor person [each day].\u201d Scholars of the past and present made efforts to determine an appropriate quantity based on the staple food items of their own time, place, and custom. The M\u0101lik\u012bs and Sh\u0101fi\u02bb\u012bs translated the amount into one mudd (or one-quarter \u1e63\u0101\u02bb ) of food, which is a volumetric measure roughly equivalent to 0.75 liters. The \u1e24anaf\u012bs said that the quantity should vary based on the type of food (one \u1e63\u0101\u02bb of dates, or one \u1e63\u0101\u02bb of barley, or half a \u1e63\u0101\u02bb of wheat) 1 . The \u1e24anbal\u012bs had a similar conclusion, determining that the fidyah should be one mudd of wheat, or half a \u1e63\u0101\u02bb of dates or barley. 2 One approach to calculate the monetary value of fidyah is to convert these volumes of food into weights, and then use minimums, maximums, averages, or weighted averages to determine a dollar amount. The approach of the Fiqh Council of North America on this matter is to follow the spirit of the Qur\u2019\u0101nic injunction of \u201cfeeding a poor person [each day]\u201d, which is to determine the average price of a reasonable amount of food for a person each day. Following a methodology similar to move.org , we looked at Numbeo\u2019s estimated monthly food costs 3 in each state\u2019s most populous city 4 and used these to determine the daily cost of food. The most current data (based on Western food types), retrieved on February 19, 2025, is as follows: Rank State Most populous city Monthly food cost Daily food cost 1 Hawaii Honolulu $612.07 $19.74 2 New York New York City $565.39 $18.24 3 Massachusetts Boston $531.90 $17.16 4 Washington Seattle $528.00 $17.03 5 Pennsylvania Philadelphia $520.33 $16.78 6 Georgia Atlanta $516.93 $16.68 7 District of Columbia Washington DC $498.99 $16.10 8 Alaska Anchorage $497.61 $16.05 9 South Carolina Charleston $497.54 $16.04 10 North Dakota Fargo $496.64 $16.02 11 Maine Portland $488.09 $15.74 12 California Los Angeles $477.46 $15.40 13 Delaware Wilmington $472.58 $15.24 14 Minnesota Minneapolis $463.98 $14.97 15 Alabama Birmingham $461.22 $14.88 16 Tennessee Nashville $460.97 $14.87 17 New Jersey Newark $459.23 $14.81 18 Vermont Burlington $458.50 $14.79 19 Illinois Chicago $458.08 $14.78 20 Maryland Baltimore $456.74 $14.73 21 Colorado Denver $449.93 $14.51 22 Oregon Portland $440.98 $14.23 23 Louisiana New Orleans $436.21 $14.07 24 Ohio Columbus $435.92 $14.06 25 South Dakota Sioux Falls $434.79 $14.03 26 Michigan Detroit $431.18 $13.91 27 Montana Billings $419.61 $13.54 28 Nebraska Omaha $419.31 $13.53 29 Connecticut Bridgeport $415.75 $13.41 30 Rhode Island Providence $413.41 $13.34 31 New Mexico Albuquerque $413.63 $13.34 32 Wisconsin Milwaukee $410.25 $13.23 33 Missouri Kansas City $407.11 $13.13 34 New Hampshire Manchester $398.23 $12.85 35 Kentucky Louisville $394.78 $12.73 36 Florida Jacksonville $393.59 $12.70 37 Utah Salt Lake City $390.86 $12.61 38 Kansas Wichita $382.95 $12.35 39 North Carolina Charlotte $379.26 $12.23 40 Nevada Las Vegas $379.26 $12.23 41 Oklahoma Oklahoma City $378.95 $12.22 42 Texas Houston $377.48 $12.18 43 Arizona Phoenix $374.16 $12.07 44 Indiana Indianapolis $373.53 $12.05 45 Idaho Boise $372.54 $12.02 46 Mississippi Jackson $356.53 $11.50 47 Iowa Des Moines $350.12 $11.29 48 Arkansas Little Rock $348.34 $11.24 49 Wyoming Cheyenne $340.21 $10.97 50 Virginia Virginia Beach $331.53 $10.69 51 West Virginia Charleston $327.37 $10.56 Monthly Food Costs by State As can be seen, the amounts vary based on location, and are approximates. If a community feels that another figure, based on the parameters mentioned in this fatwa, better suits their particular locality, they may adjust accordingly. For example, they may look up the value for their locality from the Numbeo website. However, the Fiqh Council does not see a problem with using a national average across the United States. Based on data from Numbeo, this would be $13.98 as accessed on February 19, 2025, which we have rounded up to $15. DETAILS OF ZAK\u0100T AL-FI\u1e6cR Zak\u0101t al-fi\u1e6dr, also called \u1e63adaqat al-fi\u1e6dr, is an obligatory charitable payment given at the end of Rama\u1e0d\u0101n. The zak\u0101t al-fi\u1e6dr amount is generally considered to be one \u1e63\u0101\u02bb of staple food based on a narration of the Prophet\u00a0\ufdfa. 5 As a volumetric measure, a \u1e63\u0101\u02bb of food will translate into different weights depending on the item of food, and then each item of food can be converted into an associated retail dollar cost. Food Item Weight 6 U.S. Retail Cost 7 Rice 5.4 pounds $4.64 Wheat flour 4 pounds $3.52 Pasta 2.2 pounds $2.93 Oats 2.43 pounds $3.26 Dates 4.63 pounds $18.61 Barley 3.53 pounds 8 $3.11 \u1e62\u0101 \u02bb of Food Items to Dollar Cost As can be seen, the amount\u00a0can vary greatly based on the specific food item selected. Further variation can be found based on the specific location. Even greater variation can be found if the volumetric amount is first converted into a weight without considering the specific food item (not taking into consideration that different food items have different densities), and then the specific food item is selected to convert into a cost. If we were to approximate based on a blended average of staple food items in the United States, the zak\u0101t al-fi\u1e6dr amount would be more than five dollars, but because of the large variation in price (e.g. the high price for dates), we encourage Muslims to increase the amount to $10 out of caution. 9 Prepared by Sh.

The most current data (based on Western food types), retrieved on February 19, 2025, is as follows: Rank State Most populous city Monthly food cost Daily food cost 1 Hawaii Honolulu $612.07 $19.74 2 New York New York City $565.39 $18.24 3 Massachusetts Boston $531.90 $17.16 4 Washington Seattle $528.00 $17.03 5 Pennsylvania Philadelphia $520.33 $16.78 6 Georgia Atlanta $516.93 $16.68 7 District of Columbia Washington DC $498.99 $16.10 8 Alaska Anchorage $497.61 $16.05 9 South Carolina Charleston $497.54 $16.04 10 North Dakota Fargo $496.64 $16.02 11 Maine Portland $488.09 $15.74 12 California Los Angeles $477.46 $15.40 13 Delaware Wilmington $472.58 $15.24 14 Minnesota Minneapolis $463.98 $14.97 15 Alabama Birmingham $461.22 $14.88 16 Tennessee Nashville $460.97 $14.87 17 New Jersey Newark $459.23 $14.81 18 Vermont Burlington $458.50 $14.79 19 Illinois Chicago $458.08 $14.78 20 Maryland Baltimore $456.74 $14.73 21 Colorado Denver $449.93 $14.51 22 Oregon Portland $440.98 $14.23 23 Louisiana New Orleans $436.21 $14.07 24 Ohio Columbus $435.92 $14.06 25 South Dakota Sioux Falls $434.79 $14.03 26 Michigan Detroit $431.18 $13.91 27 Montana Billings $419.61 $13.54 28 Nebraska Omaha $419.31 $13.53 29 Connecticut Bridgeport $415.75 $13.41 30 Rhode Island Providence $413.41 $13.34 31 New Mexico Albuquerque $413.63 $13.34 32 Wisconsin Milwaukee $410.25 $13.23 33 Missouri Kansas City $407.11 $13.13 34 New Hampshire Manchester $398.23 $12.85 35 Kentucky Louisville $394.78 $12.73 36 Florida Jacksonville $393.59 $12.70 37 Utah Salt Lake City $390.86 $12.61 38 Kansas Wichita $382.95 $12.35 39 North Carolina Charlotte $379.26 $12.23 40 Nevada Las Vegas $379.26 $12.23 41 Oklahoma Oklahoma City $378.95 $12.22 42 Texas Houston $377.48 $12.18 43 Arizona Phoenix $374.16 $12.07 44 Indiana Indianapolis $373.53 $12.05 45 Idaho Boise $372.54 $12.02 46 Mississippi Jackson $356.53 $11.50 47 Iowa Des Moines $350.12 $11.29 48 Arkansas Little Rock $348.34 $11.24 49 Wyoming Cheyenne $340.21 $10.97 50 Virginia Virginia Beach $331.53 $10.69 51 West Virginia Charleston $327.37 $10.56 Monthly Food Costs by State As can be seen, the amounts vary based on location, and are approximates. If a community feels that another figure, based on the parameters mentioned in this fatwa, better suits their particular locality, they may adjust accordingly. For example, they may look up the value for their locality from the Numbeo website. However, the Fiqh Council does not see a problem with using a national average across the United States. Based on data from Numbeo, this would be $13.98 as accessed on February 19, 2025, which we have rounded up to $15. DETAILS OF ZAK\u0100T AL-FI\u1e6cR Zak\u0101t al-fi\u1e6dr, also called \u1e63adaqat al-fi\u1e6dr, is an obligatory charitable payment given at the end of Rama\u1e0d\u0101n. The zak\u0101t al-fi\u1e6dr amount is generally considered to be one \u1e63\u0101\u02bb of staple food based on a narration of the Prophet\u00a0\ufdfa. 5 As a volumetric measure, a \u1e63\u0101\u02bb of food will translate into different weights depending on the item of food, and then each item of food can be converted into an associated retail dollar cost. Food Item Weight 6 U.S. Retail Cost 7 Rice 5.4 pounds $4.64 Wheat flour 4 pounds $3.52 Pasta 2.2 pounds $2.93 Oats 2.43 pounds $3.26 Dates 4.63 pounds $18.61 Barley 3.53 pounds 8 $3.11 \u1e62\u0101 \u02bb of Food Items to Dollar Cost As can be seen, the amount\u00a0can vary greatly based on the specific food item selected. Further variation can be found based on the specific location. Even greater variation can be found if the volumetric amount is first converted into a weight without considering the specific food item (not taking into consideration that different food items have different densities), and then the specific food item is selected to convert into a cost. If we were to approximate based on a blended average of staple food items in the United States, the zak\u0101t al-fi\u1e6dr amount would be more than five dollars, but because of the large variation in price (e.g. the high price for dates), we encourage Muslims to increase the amount to $10 out of caution. 9 Prepared by Sh.

{"question": "Unknown question", "answer": "What is the Islamic ruling on investing in stocks? All praise is due to\u00a0All\u0101h\u00a0\ufdfb,\u00a0and may peace and salutations be\u00a0upon\u00a0the Prophet\u00a0\ufdfa. Fundamental Rulings Related to Investing in Joint-Stock Companies Public joint-stock companies, for the purposes of Islamic jurisprudence, are treated as shirkah al-\u02bbin\u0101n , and are therefore subject to the same rulings. A share represents an undivided share in the capital of a corporation, just as it represents an undivided share in its assets and its associated rights, once the capital is converted into tangible items, benefits, rights, debts and so on. Shares are of two types \u2013 common shares and preferred shares. Common shares participate in both profit and loss and are permissible. Preferred shares participate only in profit and do not bear loss, and they are impermissible. Shares may be purchased for capital appreciation, which is where someone intends to buy and sell shares with the primary intent to benefit from the difference in price. Or, the investor\u2019s primary intent may be to benefit from distribution of profits such as dividends. The rules mentioned in this Fatw\u0101 will apply to both. Shares may be sold as a spot trade, where the trade takes place immediately, with the intention of taking delivery of the underlying shares immediately, and this is permissible. However, trading on margin (borrowing money to carry out purchases), short selling (borrowing shares to sell them, with the goal to purchase them at a lower price in the future), stock options, futures contracts, forward contracts, and other types of derivatives are not permissible. These types of sales include elements of interest ( rib\u0101 ), impermissible uncertainty ( gharar ), gambling ( qim\u0101r ), and other impermissible elements, such as \u201cselling that which you do not own\u201d. Another impermissible transaction is lending ( iqr\u0101\u1e0d ) or leasing ( \u012bj\u0101r ) shares for a fee, as the underlying assets of a share do not align with the rulings of these contracts. The fact that companies may hold cash or debt as a part of their assets generally does not affect the permissibility of buying and selling shares, as these are secondary activities. The primary activity involves the tangible and intangible assets of the business, and the benefits associated with those. Secondary elements follow the rulings of the primary ones and do not have their own rulings. However, if all the assets of the company become debts, then the rulings of selling debts must be adhered to. Similarly, if all the assets of the company become cash, as may be the case when starting a business, the rules for currency exchange must be followed. Joint-stock companies may fall into one of three categories: Permissible companies: These are companies whose objectives and activities are entirely lawful, so their shares are permissible. Forbidden companies: These are companies whose objectives and activities are unlawful, and their shares cannot be dealt with at all. Mixed companies: These are companies whose primary objectives and activities are lawful, but they engage in some unlawful activities, and these will be discussed in the next section. Rulings of Investing in Mixed Companies The default ruling of dealing in the shares of mixed companies is prohibition, as decided by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy and the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League. As an example, if a person buys such shares without knowing that the company deals in interest ( rib\u0101 ), then learns of it, they must divest from it. This is because the Qur\u2019\u0101n and Sunnah prohibit interest, and knowingly buying shares in such companies implies participation in dealing with interest. The Shariah Board of the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) has ruled an exception to this prohibition under certain conditions: The company\u2019s articles and bylaws should not state its objectives to be for unlawful purposes or activities. The majority of the company\u2019s transactions should be lawful, with the unlawful transactions being minimal and remaining forbidden, as indicated by the following conditions: a) The amount borrowed on interest should not exceed 30% of the company\u2019s market value. b) The amount deposited earning interest should not exceed 30% of the company\u2019s market value. c) The revenue from unlawful transactions, such as interest earned and money received from forbidden sales, should not exceed 5% of the company\u2019s total revenue. The shareholder must purify their ownership in these shares by disposing of the portion of the unlawful revenue, whether the company made profits or not, and whether it distributed profits or not. The unlawful revenue per share is calculated by dividing the unlawful revenue by the number of shares of the company\u2019s capital, as shown in the latest financial statements of the company. The unlawful revenue that appears in the financial statements for the period of dealing must be disposed of, regardless of its amount, by whoever owns the share at the end of the period. If the share is sold before that, the seller is not required to dispose of the unlawful revenue. The unlawful revenue is to be disposed of by giving it away as charity without expectation of reward. Opinion: The Fiqh Council concluded that it is permissible to deal in the shares of mixed companies by way of exception, under the following conditions: The company\u2019s main activity should not be impermissible, such as dealing with alcohol, gambling, pork products, conventional financial services (bank, insurance, etc), pornography, etc. The company\u2019s interest-bearing loans must be less than 30% of the company\u2019s market value. The company\u2019s interest-bearing deposits must be less than 30% of the company\u2019s market value. The company\u2019s unlawful income from forbidden sales and interest and should not exceed 5% of the company\u2019s total revenue. Transactions should be limited to common shares only, and not preferred shares. Transactions should be limited to spot trading of the actual shares only. Contracts for Differences (CFDs), margin trading, short selling, futures, forwards, options, and other derivatives are not permissible. The shareholder must purify the unlawful income for the number of days the share was owned. Unlike the AAOIFI standard, which requires purification only if the share is owned at the time of issuance of financial statements, our council has determined that purification is required by whoever owned the share at any time during the financial period, prorating and disposing of the unlawful revenue per share based on the number of days of ownership. The latest available financial statements of the company should be used to apply these rulings. And All\u0101h\u00a0\ufdfb knows best. Prepared by Dr.\u00a0Abdulbari Mashal and Sh.

{"question": "To what extent is obeying the parents obligatory?", "answer": "Answered by: Dr. Yasir Qadhi Answer: In the Name of All\u0101h\u00a0\ufdfb, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. All praise is due to All\u0101h \ufdfb, and may peace and blessings be upon His Messenger Mu\u1e25ammad\u00a0\ufdfa. All\u0101h\u00a0\ufdfb\u00a0says, \u201cYour Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and do good to parents. If any one of them or both of them reach old age, do not say to them: uff (a word or expression of anger or contempt) and do not scold them, and address them with respectful words.\u201d (S\u016brah al-Isr\u0101\u2019, \u0100yah 23) The importance of good treatment to parents in Islam cannot be overstated. However, it is important to note the rights of the children and to understand exactly what is obligatory for them. Although All\u0101h\u00a0\ufdfb\u00a0obligates I\u1e25s\u0101n (excellent treatment) to parents, He\u00a0\ufdfb\u00a0never obligates unconditional obedience. Rather, depending on the situation, obeying one\u2019s parents can be obligatory, or encouraged, or permissible, or even prohibited in some cases. 1 Obviously, a young child has no choice but to obey his or her parents; but once adulthood is reached and one is fully independent, obeying parents is obligatory when three conditions are fulfilled 2 : The act being commanded does not violate the law of All\u0101h\u00a0\ufdfb. Hence, all sinful commands, such as worshipping false gods, would be prohibited. The act being commanded is of real, tangible benefit to them specifically. This excludes all commands that do not directly benefit them, such as an unreasonable choice of which career the child should pursue if that choice has no relevance to the parents. 3 The act being commanded does not cause unreasonable difficulty and harm to the child. This excludes all commands that cause more difficulty to the child than can be justified with the amount of benefit to the parents; for example, the demand that the child\u2019s spouse be divorced merely because the parents do not get along with this spouse. Undoubtedly, some aspects would be ambiguous. For example, if the parent has a request regarding where a child should live, and they desire for some proximity in order to serve them in their time of need, that is a request that would have to factor many aspects into it, such as: How many other siblings can share in this help? How much of a burden would it be for a child to live in that vicinity? What is the situation of the parents themselves and how much do they need the support of this son or daughter? And there would be many other factors as well. In all cases, one must be respectful to one\u2019s parents and use kind words even when turning down a request of theirs. Disagreeing with parents or choosing not to follow their advice should be done gently and respectfully. Additionally, even in cases where obeying the parents isn\u2019t obligated, it can be recommended and rewarded for him to obey them if it does not harm anyone, because that is a form of love and respect. As stated above, these are only generic guidelines. Many times, the exact line where obedience is required and where it is not required is impossible to pinpoint. Interpersonal situations are always complicated and require consideration of multiple factors. There can be gray areas which need personal judgement. Overall, one should strive to please one\u2019s parents to the greatest extent possible, without causing undue harm to one\u2019s own self or to one\u2019s spouse and children.
